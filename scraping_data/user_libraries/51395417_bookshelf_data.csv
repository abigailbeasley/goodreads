Maybe even a good one. But, by the end of the first chapter I had a bad feeling about this book.To be blunt I hated this text for the first 100 or so pages. At that point it got a little more interesting for me (it’s only 218 pages total), but I never wanted to pick it up. Now before you ask the obvious, it was a book club choice that’s why I kept reading. A book that looks at the neutering of men in society, a book that looks at civil chaos, a book that examines the idea of connection in an increasingly isolated world…such good topics. Good topics not fully realized in this text.Quotes:•	“On a long enough timeline, the survival rate for everyone will drop to zero.”•	“Loosing all hope was freedom.”•	“Then you’re trapped in your lovely nest, and the things you used to own, now they own you.”•	“There are lots of things we don’t want to know about the people we love.•	“Only in death will we have our own names since only in death are we no longer part of the effort.”I will say this about FIGHT CLUB, although I never liked it, I did appreciate it more after our club discussion than I did before we talked. The vulgarity, the ugliness, the violence…if you are going to go there, then the book needs to be stunning. This one isn’t.

All ed on Goodreads.Best and favorite reads of the year: ""Nobody’s Fool"" and “Everybody’s Fool” (Richard Russo), the first novels of his I have ever read. I greatly enjoyed them, I have more of him on my “to read” pile. I also read the final two books in Kent Haruf’s Holt trilogy, ""Eventide” and “Benediction” and both were brilliant. I also read the final installment of Hilary Mantel’s Thomas Cromwell trilogy, “The Mirror and the Light” which was an astounding conclusion to that series. I also read “A Greif Observed” (C.S. Lewis) and I found a great comfort in Lewis’s ability to articulate such a complicated emotion. Favorite (and only) reread: ""Confederates in the Attic” (Tony Horwitz), a book which still holds up after my initial reading of it over 20 years ago. I read 23 nonfiction this year. Top of that list were the aforementioned ""Confederates in the Attic”, and I also enjoyed “Wild Bill” (Tom Clavin) and “Pirate Hunters” (Robert Curson). Two texts that were much more interesting than I was anticipating. Biggest 'meh' reads of the year: “Stealing Rembrandts” (Anthony M. Amore) and “The Line Becomes a River” (Francisco Cantu). Both nonfiction, both which could have been so much better than they were. Most disappointing book and one I should have put down: “Camino Winds” (John Grisham) was just dumb. “Lady Romeo” (Tana Wojczuk) was a nonfiction piece about a famous actress of the 1800s that was ruined by the author’s inability to handle the subject matter.Best Surprise of the Year: “Spearhead” (Adam Markos) a nonfiction text about a tank division in WW II which really drew me in. I have added another of his books to my “to read” pile. I also really enjoyed “Marley” (Jon Clinch) and as a result have added more Dickens, and Mr. Clinch to my “to read” pile. “Marley” is a backstory to the minor character from Dickens’ “A Christmas Carol” and it had my complete attention.I continued my way thru Daniel Silva's Gabriel Allon series. I read #16 (the first book in the series I ever picked up, which prompted me to go back to #1 and read from the beginning) and # 17 this past year, “The Black Widow” and “The House of Spies”, two books that together form one long story. They are smart books, have an element of legitimacy, are fast paced thrillers, and Silva is a decent writer.I read no plays in 2023. Very unusual for me. Other misc. observations:-I finished a project I had set of reading the Bible all the way through. Something that I enjoyed and learned a lot by doing, and something I intend to do again. -I listened to 8 audio books in 2023. I had never listened to audio books before. I’m finding it is a great thing to do, especially if it is a book I feel uncertain about. 5 of the 8 were nonfiction, and I feel that genre is better for audio. At least for me. It kind of feels like listening to a podcast. -I returned to Tim Dorsey’s Serge A. Storms series this summer, reading it on the beach which is the perfect place to consume it. They are usually good for a laugh. ""Naked Came the Florida Man"". Mr. Dorsey died in November 2023, so assuming the current output will be the end of the series I now only have 3 more books to go until my journey with this series ends.15 books I read in 2023 were part of larger series. I like series, but I feel that I have too many of them going at the moment. It makes me a little anxious. Looking forward to what reading in 2024 brings my way.Here is to a wonderful reading year Goodreads friends!...more",Notes are private!,8,25,0,not set,not set,"Feb 27, 2024",,,view (with text),/book/show/62316199-2023-on-goodreads

I listened to it as an audiobook because I thought it would be more political than it was. It’s more history and political science theory then I was expecting. And that’s a good thing. A note, for me the audiobook took a little getting use to as Mr. Shapiro has a very quick reading pace, and I had to get used to his quick cadence.Mr. Shapiro breaks down the American citizenry into two broad categories, Unionist and Disintegrationist. The rest of the book is an examination of how individuals view and live out their American lives considering the philosophy that seems to govern them. This dichotomy is broken down in a concise and interesting manner in the text’s Introduction.As I read chapter one of HOW TO DESTROY AMERICA IN THREE EASY STEPS, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was real political science. It was an examination of principles and ideas, not parties or politics. As I progressed through the text it also became part history lesson. I did not always agree with the lesson that Shapiro took from history, but I appreciated his thoughts on it. An interesting note, although he is conservative Mr. Shapiro frequently disagrees with, and takes on, the views of others who call themselves conservative. This willingness to disagree with principles over common political cause was engaging to read. Examine the ideas, not just circle the wagons because we may have a common enemy.Quotes:•	“But encouraging better individual decision making doesn’t fit within the Disintegrationist worldview.”•	“Disintegrationist history is designed to explain everything, but it fixes nothing.”•	“The social media mob will come for anyone and everyone-even, hilariously enough, those who have egged on the social media mob.”My favorite part of the experience was chapter 5 of this book, called “The American History”. It is an excellent, and interesting, overview of American policy as it relates to specific events from our founding to current day. It is 44 pages of concise, engaging, and thoughtful history and analysis. High school (or sadly college) classes should read it just to get an idea of the board sweep of American history so they can then begin to dive in and dissect and debate it.HOW TO DESTROY AMERICA IN THREE EASY STEPS was a better experience than I was anticipating, and my attention was held. I had to think, engage, and digest its content, and I appreciate books/writers that do that. Plus, the ideas it presents are well thought out. I’ll read another book of Mr. Shapiro’s at some point....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Feb 20, 2024","Mar 16, 2024","Feb 20, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50496911-how-to-destroy-america-in-three-easy-steps

The novel is always in forward motion. It features rich robust characters without being bogged down in an eternal internal miasma of self-reflection. Never once while reading it was I bored with it.The plot, in brief, is that Simon is a young musician conscripted into Confederate forces at the tail end of the Civil War. Originally from Kentucky, Simon is now in Texas. Right at the war’s end, Simon sees an Irish governess at an officer’s ball he is playing for, and he falls in love. And Simon purses that love for the rest of the novel. The entire story takes pace in Texas between 1865 and 1867.The style of the novel is occasionally very abrupt, which took me a minute to get use to. However, that fast pace and abruptness ultimately works very well for this text. The protagonist Simon is always moving forward. He tackles the circumstances he finds himself in, he is not ruled by them. As a result, the narrative is always propelled forward.I especially enjoyed how music, the technical and emotional aspects of it, are integrated into the character’s emotional lives. Ms. Jiles does this with a deft and skillful hand. It is so seamless you sometimes don’t realize she is doing it unless you step back from the novel and think about it for a moment.Quotes:•	“He loved solitude; it was as necessary to him as music and water.”•	“He knew that he did not play music so much as walk into it…”•	“They would be for each other as much as the world was not.”•	“Trust in God, her mother said, but never dance in a small boat.”•	“But that’s why God made people young at first, to get the doing done.”•	“…and now everything I remember will be gone.”•	“He had forgotten that there was silence in the world.”•	“It was a song that came to people as sadness, as memory, as longing.”•	“Become wise, young man, and cynical, and life will be far more understandable.”•	“We all suffer from some deficiency and must bear our sinful natures with patience.”•	“A person could get seized at the most inopportune moments by sheer animal desire.”•	“If we all knew one another’s lives in all the details nobody would marry anybody.”SIMON THE FIDDLER was my first novel of Paulette Jiles.

I saw Mr. Bedford perform this show live on stage, and it should be noted that this is an audio book only. There is no written version of it. It speaks to Mr. Bedford’s talents that he conveys so much characterization, and depth of emotion, through an audio only performance. His rendering of some of these famous Shakespearean monologues are among my favorites.Some highlights of the piece include:- Bedford’s (probably apocryphal) linking of some of the Sonnet’s to Shakespeare’s life and loves. It really makes some of those pieces come alive.- There are a trio of monologues from RICHARD II that are exquisite in their poetry and beautifully delivered.- This piece includes some rarely performed monologues from HENRY VI that remind the listener of just how good those early plays of Shakespeare’s are.- There is a lovely and sentimental connection that Bedford makes between THE TEMPEST and Shakespeare’s retirement from the stage.As noted, this piece is mostly not a true rendering of Shakespeare’s life and it draws heavily on the idea of an artist’s work being autobiographical, which is a tenuous premise. But I just love it, and this piece (which I first discovered early in my undergraduate days) was the motivating reason for my falling in love with Shakespeare.

And it was what I needed to read at this season in my life, so I guess I picked it up when I was supposed to. I found it a stimulating text, and one that gave me reason to think and ponder. Right off the bat the first chapter in the book doles out some truth on the role and purpose of prayer in our lives. For me, they were sobering and needed thoughts.I’ll focus on a couple of highlights from the text, but first I want to say that this book is not a how-to manual. I think some folks approach it in that manner. Rather it is an analysis of the role of prayer and its importance in the life of a Christian.Highlights:-	The text emphasizes that prayer is work, necessary work. Chapter two, “Our Real Work” gives a nice analysis of this practicality.-	I appreciated the author’s thoughts on the dangers of an impersonal God. It is an often-overlooked aspect of a nominal Christian life.-	The word “yada” means “to know”. The author gives an excellent exegesis about this phrase.-	Chapter 6 has some eye opening (at least for me) examinations of the role of praise in one’s faith. It made some very powerful points about how praise is needed even during personal failure, etc. Which is counter to my practice. To my own detriment.-	I was heartened to read a section where the author discusses being angry with God and not trying to hide that in our dialogue with Him. I have long thought the same thing, and it was nice to see it agreed with.Quotes:•	“God often illustrates for you in the life of another a blessing that He desires for you.”•	“…the business of the church is to pray.”•	“When we lose God’s view of things we lose perspective on everything else, too.”•	“The logic of secularization is busyness.”•	“The choices we make when we are not motivated are the most critical of our Christian walk.”•	“Before it is anything else, lack of prayer is a lack of hunger for God.”•	“With simplicity comes gratitude and joy.”•	“Prayer is both a ‘must’ and a ‘may’, an obligation and a gift.”•	“To know something is good, even great. To be known is transforming.”•	“Questions are critical to faith.”•	“Answered prayer comes from His living in us and our living in Him.”The final chapter of DEEPENING YOUR CONVERSATION WITH GOD includes some thoughtful points about corporate prayer, which I think would be good for any Christian to consider. Worship and prayer with others are vital to the Christian walk.This text kept my attention, and I found that reading a bit of it every day gave me some insightful ideas to contemplate.

This is the third book of “You are to hold at all costs.”Alex Kershaw is fast becoming one of my favorite nonfiction writers on the subject of WW II. This is the third book of his I have read, and none have disappointed. THE LONGEST WINTER is about 18 men in the American 99th Army Division, who in December of 1944 were responsible for slowing a massive German surprise attack in the Belgian village of Lanzareth at the very beginning of what became known as the Battle of the Bulge. For eighteen hours these men (who were merely part of a reconnaissance team) slowed the German advance. Miraculously, all 18 men who fought in that battle survived the war, this even though many were wounded, and most ended up under horrible conditions in POW camps.This text has a slow start, but Mr. Kershaw is doing what he does best…making the people of history come alive by exploring their humanity and the mundane of their lives. By his doing this we recognize ourselves and become more invested in what we are reading.Like the previous Kershaw books I have read, this one is composed of several human moments that stick with the reader. Here are just a few.-	A wounded GI left unattended by his captors on the outside of a rail car in the cold Belgian winter recites the 23rd Psalm repeatedly as his anesthetic to distract from the pain of his wound.-	An army chaplain contemplates the bodies of 40 dead GIs, POWs who have just been killed by friendly Allied fire, just days before the war’s end.-	An old German woman gives two POWs some bread smothered with butter and jelly as they are marched by her house on the way to a camp.-	An allied nurse cries as she cradles the body of a dying German SS soldier.-	Allied POWs sit in boxcars at Dachau as the SS work feverishly to exterminate more “undesirables” in the war’s final days.Mr. Kershaw excels at making the historical personal, and this text is no exception.Quotes:•	“…the truly brave go mostly unrewarded.”•	“I give you the gallant men of the I&R platoon, 394th Infantry, 99th Infantry Division, and the high honors-however belated- now bestowed upon them.”Due to happenstance circumstances, the men of this brave platoon were not recognized by their government for many years. But I am thankful for books like THE LONGEST WINTER that will live on and ensure that moments (and people) like this, moments that are so consequential in the history of Western Civilization, will be preserved for future generations to learn from. I am a beneficiary of the sacrifices of this generation, and writers like Mr. Kershaw powerfully remind me of this....more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,"Jan 27, 2024","Feb 11, 2024","Jan 27, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1312031.The_Longest_Winter

It is also the second book of Connelly’s I have ever read, the other being the first in this series. In this outing Connelly brings in his prolific character Harry Bosch, who I only know because I have seen some of the Amazon Prime series based on that character. To be frank, I kinda wish he had kept Bosch out of this series. This novel’s Boschless predecessor (THE LATE SHOW) is better than this one.The plot- graveyard shift detective Renée Ballard falls into an accidental partnership with Harry Bosch over a 9 year old cold case. They work on this while dealing with separate cases/issues in their individual lives, collaborating as time permits. The novel’s point of view shifts between these two characters.Honestly this was pretty routine crime fiction fare. There was a little more ridiculousness with some of the plot elements in this one then I recall from the first in the series, and the most eye rolling moments where those with Bosch, which is why I wish he had not popped into this series.Weirdly one of the biggest surprises in this text was a description of sexual climax that was one of the most succinct and poetic descriptions of that moment that I have ever encountered in a novel. Very unexpected to say the least.Quotes:•	“Well, it’s like they say, the cover-up is worse than the crime. It always gets them in the end.”•	“For every noble movement or advancement in the human endeavor across time, there were always betrayers who set everything a step back.”•	“He realized that the long wait for justice had been too long…”•	“You’ve got scars on your face but nobody can see them.”•	“But we bend the rules. We don’t break them.”The last 100 pages are not as interesting as the first 300 pages. The story fizzles out a little. But it’s still a fun read.

This book gets so many (all) of those issues wrong because it rushed to have something to say about them before enough time had passed to see if first impressions ended up being the truth. Instead what we get is a novel that reflects the arrogance of the assumptions of the author’s world view.The section that deals with covid is especially ridiculous.

The book’s Introduction grabbed my attention immediately, and it makes a great point about preconceived notions, and how we try so hard to protect them. Mr. Strobel organizes the book as a series of interviews with various experts with many credentials and expertise. He approaches this examination though an empirical lens, and it is an approach that is different from most texts, which tend to be primarily faith based. Strobel writes like the journalist he was for many years. The book is laid out as a critical investigation. There are no literary flourishes, or rhetorical arias, just step by step logical progressions.Some highlights for me:-	In chapter 8 a psychologist gives the most succinct overview of Jesus’ human traits that I have ever read. It was simply beautiful.-	In the conclusion there is a list that explores the implications of Jesus being who He is. It is a great list for Christians to acknowledge and ponder.-	I really liked the organizational structure of putting the gospels though 8 evidential tests. I had never looked at it in that manner before.-	The final 6 pages of the concluding chapter, “The Verdict of History”, are powerful. A personal confirmation (from Strobel’s experience) of the life changing power of Christ.-	This edition has an interview with Mr. Strobel that cleared up some of my nagging criticisms of the text.Quotes:•	“If Jesus is to be believed- and I realize that may be a big if for you at this point- then nothing is more important than how you respond to Him.”•	“…I sensed that he isn’t out to pummel opponents with his arguments; he’s sincerely seeking to win over people whom he believes matter to God.”•	“And for people to accept the evidence for the resurrection of Jesus and not take the final step of testing it experientially would be to miss where the evidence is ultimately pointing.”THE CASE FOR CHRIST is an interesting read. One that for the most part tries to look at Christ in the realm of empirical data. Faith is a huge component of the Christian practice, and I appreciate that Strobel ultimately keeps that faith experience at the center of what is valuable in a Christian walk. He writes of his life before coming to Christ that his “main motivator was personal pleasure- and ironically, the more I hungrily sought after it, the more elusive and self-destructive it became.” I know that experience all too well, Lee. All too well. I am humbled and grateful that one day the Living Christ revealed Himself to me. ...more",Notes are private!,8,22,1,"Dec 30, 2023","Feb 06, 2024","Dec 30, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/27840542-the-case-for-christ

As a man of devout Christian faith, and a Protest“…here was a man who believed in something.” (4.5 stars)I had never read a book about Martin Luther. As a man of devout Christian faith, and a Protestant, I felt like I probably should. So I picked up Eric Metaxas’ excellent biography of Luther, and I am the better, and more knowledgeable, for it. One thing this biography emphasizes again and again was “Luther’s advice was to trust God and to trust him radically.” He certainly lived his own advice.In this text Mr. Metaxas makes abundantly clear that Luther’s impact was made greater because of the printing press and how much it was responsible for the dissemination of his speaking and writing. That simple invention has changed the world in more ways than I think we fully appreciate. It took Luther’s teaching directly to the people, and for the first time in human history the common man was being directly communicated with while being treated as an entity worthy of the information. It’s remarkable. This is one of many examples from the text that back up the book’s assertion that, “Luther’s story is a testament to how things beyond him shaped his course and the course of the Reformation in general.”Some highlights of the text:Especially good is Metaxas’ close examination of the famous Diet of Worms, and the theological implications of what Luther said there.The chapter called “Fanaticism & Violence” is an excellent analysis of how legalistic and fanatical folks can destroy such good things. It is also deft in its thoughts on how a natural consequence of freedom is the growth of fanaticism. At one point Metaxas writes, “There is nothing quite like religious madness, and that it is a foretaste of hell can hardly be debated.”Metaxas includes many footnotes throughout the text, some of them mere outlets for his brand of humor. Overall, I did not mind them.Quotes:•	“Luther was the unwitting harbinger of a new world in which the well-established boundaries of what was acceptable were exploded, never to be restored. Suddenly the individual had not only the freedom and possibility of thinking for himself but the weighty responsibility before God of doing so.”•	“His view of the truth was far too high for him to let confusing or errant things slip by the wayside.”•	“Luther saw in this the very essence of Christian theology. God reached down not halfway to meet us in our vileness but all the way down, to the foul dregs of our broken humanity.”•	“We are alone at the end of all human capability and logic, looking up.”•	“He came out decisively for the idea that the Bible must supersede the church, which came to be known as the idea of Sola scriptura.”•	“Luther’s theology had dragged a startlingly egalitarianism out of the Gospels and into the center of history, and history and the world would never be the same.”•	“…he translated the New Testament into German, forever releasing from its Latin prison the simple song of freedom itself, which would fly around the world and never again be hidden away.”•	“He was concerned more about the people than about the correctness of the theology.”•	“His business was to obey.”•	“Ideas have consequences and Luther’s had more than most.”•	“Here was the very wound at the heart of human existence: even when we know as much as or more than anyone else of the truth of God, we are nonetheless sufficiently mired in the fallenness of this world so that we are unable fully to comprehend what we know to be true.”•	“All that was good was of God, and to create walls where God has built none was far worse than a mere tragic mistake.”The book is not hagiography however. Mr. Metaxas does not shy away from Luther’s contradictions and unsavory aspects. His look at some of Luther’s late life writings about Jews is disconcerting. Mr. Metaxas has written an interesting and challenging text that I greatly appreciated. His personal analysis and thoughts on Luther’s life and teachings are also interesting to take in. I am very glad I read MARTIN LUTHER.The Epilogue, “The Man Who Created the Future” is an erudite and often profound examination of Luther’s legacy on western civilization since his death. It makes the book’s subtitle, “The Man Who Rediscovered God and Changed the World” very hard to deny. The text sums it up best, “But there was no going back.”...more",Notes are private!,4,25,1,"Dec 23, 2023","Jan 20, 2024","Dec 23, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34348320-martin-luther

That’s the motivating action for this novel, but it is never explained why the hand needs buried, and why those who try to stop this from happening go to the ends of the earth to try and stop it.

Author Jon Clinch cleverly fills in some of the gaps that are in A CHRISTMAS CAROL in a manner that works with that text. It is very Dickensian in its style, and the names reek of Dickens’ ability to create character names that also indicate what the character is like. Names like Drabb, Sweedlepipe, Gradgrine, etc. They’re just fun. I suspect many of them probably came from other Dickens works. I have regrettably only read a little of him. The text also abounds with allusions and hints of foreshadowing that readers of A CHRISTMAS CAROL will catch. Especially clever is a cameo from a young (child) Bob Cratchit.Mr. Clinch has imagined the life of Jacob Marley, who in Dickens’ world we only know as a ghost. Beginning with Marley’s youth in 1787 and ending with his death in 1836 we see what made this man tick. Clinch’s creation is a con man of the highest order. A bad dude, one with not a single scruple. One of the things I enjoyed about this book was the writing. So many fun sentences, like this… “The deliveryman has a wooden leg that belongs to him, and a horse and a wagon that don’t.” Also enjoyable was the fact that we get a glimpse of the kind of life Scrooge could have lived. It’s sad to see this light in his character, knowing that it will be extinguished with bitterness and greed. Clinch’s Ebenezer Scrooge is a man ruined by his poor choice in friends and partners.Quotes:•	“The details do not matter, though, for the principle is the thing.”•	“What sort of Englishman is forever too busy for tea?”•	“It looks hastily done but its offhandedness is a matter of much consideration. Such is art.”•	“I should think there’s wisdom in choosing when to do battle…”•	“They recede into the past, generation by generation, terrible ordinary men with terrible ordinary failings and terrible ordinary secrets that they have learned to keep even from themselves- burdens fated to accompany them to their graves and beyond.”•	“It is better to fail at a difficult thing than to succeed at the commonplace again and again.”As stated, I enjoyed this book. The wonderful depiction of the journey of Jacob Marley is brilliant. I hated him from the text’s onset to almost the last page. I had a visceral reaction to this awful human. But Jon Clinch’s kicker of an ending pulled the rug out from under me…reminding me of Marley’s humanity. Which made his ugliness all the more terrifying. It could be my own. It also seamlessly fits into (and creates) the motivation for Marley to appear as a ghost to Scrooge in Dicken’s CAROL.MARLEY is a quick read, fast paced, and a thoughtful text.

Alas, this book is not going to increase her reputation and significance. It might actually hurt it.As the subtitle says, LADY ROMEO is the biography of America’s first celebrity. And it shows (although unintentionally I believe) just how fatuous and unworthy of note “celebrity” really is. Charlotte Cushman was an actress. A very famous one for the time. But this book is really not a biography as much as a hagiography. Apparently Ms. Cushman had no real flaws or foibles. Except it is obvious that she did. There is not a lot of depth to this text, but the author does seem to want to celebrate and focus more on Cushman’s companions and possible lovers (mostly female) and her bohemian lifestyle. Which ironically makes her life seem even emptier. Ms. Cushman floated from person to person and never seemed settled. She may have had a good and happy life, but this book does not make that case very well.The text is also riddled with factual errors. Many that I caught at a glance. The author fails this subject on so many levels. A plus, there are some interesting tidbits about the theater and its environs in the mid nineteenth century that I enjoyed reading about. However, the best part of LADY ROMEO is the first bit of the epilogue which does address (and admits) the fleeting nature / idea of celebrity. 140 years after Cushman’s well documented life and career there is barely enough material for a 178 page book.

There are moments in this text where the Gilded Age felt very “We are not yet daunted.” IN THE KINGDOM OF ICE is a good dose of narrative nonfiction. There are moments in this text where the Gilded Age felt very much alive. As the subtitle indicates, this book is about a Polar expedition that left for the North Pole in the summer of 1879. Those who survived did not return to civilization for three years. I had never heard of the USS Jeannette, and how this expedition came to become a reality (privately funded by a newspaper mogul) and the competing theories about the Artic that were floating around in the 19th century. It all makes for fascinating reading. This was my first book by Hampton Sides. Others are in my “to read” pile. Mr. Sides does a nice job of fleshing out the larger cultural context that surrounds the focus of this narrative. The second half of the nineteenth century was an endlessly fascinating time in the world. A period of vast and immense change, and Sides captures that nicely.Quotes:•	“The American invents as the Greek sculpted and the Italian painted: it is genius.”•	“We have a good crew, good food, and a good ship, and I think we have the right kind of stuff to dare all that man can do.”•	“Stay good friends and pull together…you must succeed!”•	“We face the future with the firm hope of doing something worthy of ourselves, and worthy of the flag that floats above us.”•	“The Fates seem to be against us.”•	“If ever Divine Providence was manifested in behalf of needy and exposed people, we are an instance of it.”•	“The magnitude of their struggle had forged a forgiving brotherhood.”•	“I can only say that we did our whole duty, that we did all that we could do, and that if we had not tried to do that, we would have been no men at all.”When some of the inevitable things happened, I found myself unexpectedly sad. I had built a connection with the book’s subjects, and that speaks to Mr. Sides’ skill with the narrative. The last 100 or so pages of IN THE KINGDOM OF ICE are hard to put down.

This novel begins 10 years after that one (about 1994 or so). I recommend reading them close together, mainly just to have the references fresh and to fully immerse in Richard Russo’s wonderfully compelling citizenry of North Bath, NY.Like NOBODY’S FOOL, this text takes place over only a few days. And like that book it pushes 500 pages. And that’s a good thing. It’s not the action, although the plot is fun, it is the details and observations that flesh out the book. The protagonist of NOBODY’S FOOL, Sully Sullivan, returns in this text and while he is important, he is not the main focus. Like in life, the central characters are always replaced as the world slowly moves on, and daily circumstances change. Along with Sully, other characters return and it is interesting to see how they have changed, and not changed, in the decade the reader missed. However, the protagonist of EVERYBODY’S FOOL is Doug Raymer, a minor character in the previous book. Doug is the current Chief of Police in North Bath, and his role in the previous text was minor and humorous. Doug is still responsible for a lot of humor in this text, and I just could not help rooting for the guy. Mr. Russo does a nice job of fleshing him out and making us feel tender towards him and his many foibles.This is only my second novel of Mr. Russo’s but I am growing fond of him. Mainly because his writing seems to abound with key insights into human traits and truth. Take this example from the book, which made me wince with self-recognition. “He’s always wanted friends, and later lovers, but also was repelled by intimacy and, at times, even proximity. Careful to cultivate an air of strident self-sufficiency, he was, according to Charice, extremely vulnerable.” There are moments like this that drive straight to the heart of human action and motivation all throughout this novel. Quotes:•	“I mean, look around. Who’s not a damn fool most of the time?”•	“An academic affiliation might explain both his windy nonsense and the confidence with which he delivered it.”•	“But you come here because you don’t know where else to go.”•	“Man starts thinking this late in life, no previous experience or proper guidance, there’s no telling where it could lead.”•	“You don’t have to be hard, just because the world is.”•	“We don’t forgive people because they deserve it, we forgive them because we deserve it.”•	“Wouldn’t it be a kick in the nuts if that was how things worked? If we each knew things that other people needed desperately to know, yet were forever clueless about how to help ourselves?”•	“…it occurred to him that waiting for a woman who’d forgotten something was one of life’s underrated pleasures.”Once again in EVERYBODY’S FOOL Richard Russo’s writing drew me in. I enjoyed that I was revisiting North Bath, New York. Meeting new people, getting to see different sides of people I thought I knew, and watching old friends as life and age changed them too. I love seeing how in Russo’s expert hands we see how all of these things can combine and mix in our life experiences to change our perspectives and our values.

As a rule I don’t put much stock in them.

Not sure that I agree or disagree with the author’s view, but I am glad I read his thoughts. Gave me something to ponder.-	I had never given a lot of consideration to the idea of rewards in Heaven and how that affects our individual experiences there. Since reading this book, I have been thinking and studying about it more.Quotes:•	“God knows that our minds are incapable of fully comprehending the complete magnificence of Heaven.•	“Truth is not the sum of our imagination.”•	“…forgiveness means letting go of my right to hurt another person for hurting me.”Overall, this was a good reading experience.

I had never heard of it, or its subject matter, before. It took me a while to read it, and I did not think often about wanting to pick it up, but every time I did I was captured. An odd experience.MOLOKA’I is a historical fiction account of a real leper colony that was in Hawaii. This novel takes place starting in 1891 and ends in 1970, and it clips along, covering a lot of material in a pretty quick pace. We follow one Rachel Kalama from pre diagnosis, until death, experiencing the life of one who lives (and Rachel certainly does live a life) with leprosy. The text flows very cinematically, as it does not belabor any point. It presents it, and moves on. And I liked that about this book. There really are not villains in this piece. Just people. And most people are not really bad, they just sometimes make bad decisions. I appreciate writers who remember that fact. Author Alan Brennert does not take cheap shots at targets that popular culture seems to always take cheap shots at. He does not go after low hanging fruit in this novel, and I marveled that his depictions of the Catholic Church were thoughtful. Lesser writers would have painted the easy (cheap) target of the “unfeeling church”, proselytizing before caring about the individual. But Brennert does not do that. Instead his people of the church are decent (sometimes amazing) humans, with good intentions, sometimes poor execution, but usually good hearted. I appreciated his effort to not paint cheap villains, but instead to give a humanity and realistic depth to his multi-faceted characters and their motives.Quotes:•	“…and the thought draped itself around her, warm and comforting as a favorite blanket: she wasn’t alone here.”•	“…after a while the fear became a constant, cold companion, a simple fact of existence.”•	“…for a while, at least, the ocean washed everything away. “•	“I believe in Hawai’i. I believe in the land.”•	“Fear is good. In the right degree it prevents us making fools of ourselves. But in the wrong measure it prevents us from fully living. Fear is our boon companion, but never our master.”•	“…and they sat here wordlessly, sharing more than silence.”•	“The sea is always in command, humanity an invited guest; those who did not respect that did not return.”•	“I’ve come to believe that how we choose to live with pain, or injustice, or death…is the true measure of the Divine within us.”•	“It wasn’t right. But it’s over.”One of the best things about MOLOKA’I is that the book does not focus on the negative. It focuses on living and life, acknowledging the positive and the negative as part of that process. I for one found that very refreshing. We will experience both good and bad repeatedly throughout this journey called life. And neither should dominate our choices.A note, this edition of the text features a short “Get to Know the History” section at the end that I found to be a nice complement to the book....more",Notes are private!,8,35,1,Nov 2023,"Nov 17, 2023","Nov 01, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3273.Moloka_i

I recall liking it the“Wars leave what’s called ‘ghost marks’ on the landscape.” (4.5 stars)I first read CONFEDERATES IN THE ATTIC in the late 1990s. I recall liking it then, keeping a copy on my bookshelf, and reading other books by Tony Horwitz. When I learned of of his death at a young age (I think 60?) I picked up a copy of his last book, SPYING ON THE SOUTH. Before reading that one, I decided to revisit the first book of his I had ever read.This travelogue is essentially a ten state journey through the former Confederacy, examining the fallout from the American Civil War 130 years after it ended. It is sometimes frightening, often funny, occasionally touching, and unusually profound in the most unexpected of places.This text is a reflection of its time, and I mean that in a good way. It is sadly ironic to read how divided Horwitz found the nation in the mid-nineties. Yet, the book has a pretty consistent theme that most people that Horwitz meets want to focus on our shared history, not our divided history. Yet, now, in late 2023, the media and other of their ilk (that’s not a compliment) want to focus on segregating our past, divide social groups, and push moral superiority based on skin color or ethnicity. It’s gross, and it’s not progress. As Horwitz makes clear in his writing, this would not set well with him. Those who come across most negatively in this text are people like that, who ironically are now considered legitimate voices, but at the time of this book’s composition were considered fringe.There is a lot to say about this text, but one particular highlight for me was an interview that Mr. Horwitz has with Shelby Foote, the late Civil War historian. It was so refreshing to read as it is a reminder of a time when someone could have thoughts that were nuanced and thought provoking and not get canceled. The chapter that follows this interview about the battle of Shiloh is also very good!Another highlight was the awesome chapter 10, “The Civil Wargasm”. In this chapter Horwitz accompanies a hard core Civil War reenactor on a whirlwind tour of Virginian Civil War sites of interest. The reenactor, a man named Robert Lee Hodge, is a consistent presence in the text, and a memorable part of the book’s experience.Quotes:•	“The present- I live it, it holds no mystery. The past does.”•	“They can remember the war all they want, so long’s they remember they lost.”•	“Glory had a cost. I’m here so people will remember that.”•	“I’m not going to go through this museum rewriting the past just to please someone in the present.”•	“I lay awake, afflicted by the creeping paranoia known only to 4 A.M. insomniacs- especially those camped illegally in a foggy ditch where the dead once lay in heaps.”•	“I feel honored because I wasn’t stained by college. Education isn’t everything, at least not the formal kind.”•	“You can’t miss something you never had and if you never had it, you don’t know what it’s all about.”There is a moment in the book that I found personally very moving. Horwitz writes of the inevitable collision of imaginative childhood with unimaginative adulthood in a manner that pierced my heart, as I lived the experience he was describing. I was that same Civil War obsessed child, losing my way/interest as a young adult as the fires of childhood imagination burned out, and finally coming back to the topic with a renewed interest in early middle age.CONFEDERATES IN THE ATTIC is well written, and always interesting. But more importantly it observes without passing judgment (for the most part) and that is the key to why it is so good. It’s not interested in judgement, or moral superiority. Actions speak for themselves, something that is reprehensible is reprehensible because it is wrong, and that will be obvious to any reader. This text is a reflection of people, in their good and bad graces, and a presentation of all sides of a story.

Mainly because there are less of them than there are nice moments.Here are some of the nice moments…Chapter 3 focuses on the women who washed Jesus’ feet. It is very good, mainly because Lucado resists the urge to add to it, realizing its power is in its simplicity.There are some really fine thoughts presented in chapter 17, “Nicodemus”, that give some interesting insight into the Bible’s most famous passage, John 3:16.Chapter 19 focuses on the story of the “rich young ruler”. I loved Mr. Lucado’s explanation/analysis of this story. It takes an approach to it that I had never heard presented before.

I can see why others would like it a whole lot more than me. I enjoyed it, but nothing more.The novel is a subtly atmospheric text. With an uncanny simplicity Shirley Jackson creates a story filled with tension. For me, the most powerful element of the text was the depiction of Hill House itself. It leaps off of the page more so than most of the human characters in the book. With descriptions like this, “It was a house without kindness, never meant to be lived in, not a fit place for people or for love or for hope.” how could it not?Especially interesting was the internal development of the character of Eleanor. It is spot on, and unrelentingly truthful. The harshness of her unguarded internal thoughts are jarring for the reader because we recognize some of ourselves in them. Exchanges like the following, there are quite a few in the book, were also a highlight for me. “ “I think we are only afraid of ourselves”, the doctor said slowly.“No,” Luke said. “Of seeing ourselves clearly and without disguise.” ""Moments like this get under the reader’s skin. Most of the time, the problem is us, not some other!Quotes:•	“Things were said on both sides which only time could eradicate…”•	“We never know where our courage is coming from.”•	“Well, gossip is always a bad enemy.”•	“People like answering questions about themselves, she thought; what an odd pleasure it is.”•	“No, the menace of the supernatural is that it attacks where modern minds are weakest, where we have abandoned our protective armor of superstition and have no substitute defense.”•	“A person angry, or laughing, or terrified, or jealous, will go stubbornly on into extremes of behavior impossible at another time…”•	“…and once spoken, such a question- as “Do you love me?”- could never be answered or forgotten.”•	“Without ever wanting to become reserved and shy, she had spent so long alone, with no one to love, that it was difficult for her to talk, even casually, to another person without self-consciousness and an awkward inability to find words.”Shirley Jackson’s writing has always unsettled me, which I am sure speaks to her immense talent. But I can’t say that I like the experience.

There will be others. The book starts on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving and 307 pages later we are closing out the Friday after Thanksgiving, and the novel still has over 200 pages to go. It’s a detailed and slow paced, yet engaging, read. Mr. Russo has created an eclectic ensemble, inhabitants of a small upstate New York town called North Bath, whose lives intersect and rotate around the novel’s protagonist, Don “Sully” Sullivan, a 60 year old who has made some bad life choices. Some characters that I really enjoyed getting to know (among many) are Rub, simple minded but decent, and Mrs. Peoples, old, smart, and very observant of human nature. They are vibrant in their humanity. Also worth noting, the dialogue in this book crackles. There is humor on every page. Sully’s wry voice is especially fun when he banters with his sometime boss and frenemy, Carl Roebuck. More than a few times, ideas about the human heart are considered in this text. Consider this thought, “An imperfect human heart, perfectly shattered…a condition so common as to be virtually universal, rendering issues of right or wrong almost incidental.” That line captures that thing where we recognize someone’s humanity through their ugliness. Other observations about our hearts that stuck with me: “The human heart, where compromise could not be struck, not ever” and this nugget, “…if indeed any human can be said to own his heart.” These are ideas of great depth, and worthy of contemplation. Another interesting aspect of the text is Sully’s father (Big Jim) who is long dead before the book begins. He hovers over the book, and over Sully’s life. Mr. Russo does an excellent job of recreating the influence a bad parent can exert over a life.Quotes:•	“Where was the middle ground between a sense of adventure and just plain sense?”•	“Part of getting old, she knew, was becoming unsure.”•	“Whenever he was on a stupid streak he was conscious of the faraway sound of his father’s laughter.”•	“You remain the uncontested master of the futile gesture.”•	“You could feel good in pain, and that was something not everybody knew.”•	“…and allowing herself to become intoxicated by the smells and sounds of food and family and terrible, terrible love and longing.”•	“Some phrases were truly magical in their ability to dredge up the past from the bottom of life’s lake.”•	“It didn’t pay to second guess every one of life’s decisions, to pretend to wisdom about the past from the safety of the present, the way so many people did when they got older.”•	“Don’t get stuck. Words to live by.”•	“I believed in intelligence and hard work until I met you. Only luck explains you.”•	“How come you never see anything headed your way until it runs over you?”Mr. Russo has a nice ability to articulate some of the thoughts and observations that most of us make / have about the things around us in an insightful and clarifying manner.

I will read others, but I hope they are a little better than this one. Don’t get me wrong, I liked it, but I found the writing to be disjointed at times, with lots of awkward transitions. I was surprised to find that in a writer who seems to be highly regarded.NOTHING LIKE IT IN THE WORLD is about the building of the Transcontinental Railroad, and I had never read a book on that subject, so I was interested to pick it up. More than anything this text celebrates the grit of the American mentality. Every major milestone in railroad engineering and construction came out of mid-19th century America. That is remarkable. Lots of problems encountered with this project, and one by one they were met head on and solved. Here are some highlights of the text for me:1.	Mr. Ambrose quotes liberally from primary sources. I appreciate that he present their words without commentary, not projecting our current values/mores on them. He presents them in the context of their time, and leaves it alone. As any good historian would do.2.	At one point Ambrose writes of the endeavor, “Altogether it was a great modern army, moving forward with a will and a plan, unable to stop, determined to win the battle.” This book does a nice job of demonstrating how very true that statement is.3.	Long before people could go live on social media at any time from their phones, the driving of the “golden” spike that officially signaled the transcontinental railroad’s completion on May 10th 1869 was telegraphed across the world live. It’s a very cool story, and one I knew nothing about.4.	Ambrose closes the book with a strong refutation of the accepted (and false) history that the builders of the Union Pacific and Central Pacific railroads got the better of the government. He succinctly dismantles that false notion, and shows how it was a beneficial enterprise for government and private industry.Quotes:•	“The transcontinental railroad was the last great building project to be done mostly by hand.”•	“The Union Pacific and the Central Pacific were the first big business in America.”•	“The grain fields of Europe are mere garden patches beside the green oceans which roll across the Great Plains.”•	“…the genuine American genius-the genius of the West especially, which welcomes obstacles and looks on impossibilities as incentives to greater exertion.”•	“Weather dominates everything.”•	“So work on as though Heaven were before you and Hell behind you.”•	“The locomotive was the first great triumph over time and space. After it came and crossed the continent of North America, nothing could ever again be the same. It brought about the greatest change in the shortest period of time.”•	“Together, the transcontinental railroad and the telegraph made modern America possible.”•	“But a choice made is made, it cannot be changed.”NOTHING LIKE IT IN THE WORLD is not a consistently great book, but it is a good one. The last two paragraphs of the text are excellent. Really good, and a perfect summation for the whole experience of the building of this railroad. I appreciate that Mr. Ambrose keeps these folks he is writing about squarely in their time and context. His final sentence says it best, “So we admire those who did it-even if they were far from perfect-for what they were and what they accomplished and how much each of us owes them.”...more",Notes are private!,2,39,1,"Aug 23, 2023","Sep 04, 2023","Aug 23, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/49255.Nothing_Like_It_in_the_World

It is a flawed book, but take it at face value and you will enjoy the read.The plot in short- someone is trying to kill ex-hitman Frankie Machine. Frankie has been out of the business for a while and is a popular dude on the San Diego waterfront, and he is still connected while being out of the game. Premise is ridiculous. Just go with it. Much of the novel is flashback as Frankie tries to piece together why someone is after him, by examining his sordid past. During a lot of these flashback moments the text reads a little stereotypical. There are more than a few “Goodfellas” type of moments. Another quibble is that there are lots of names, lots of minor characters with no major impact on the story. It’s like author Don Winslow got a little too caught up in throwing so much detail at the reader. Gets a tad annoying.Quotes:•	“America, Frank thinks- we’re the only country in the world afraid of our food.”•	“Things you think are lost forever, and then, suddenly, there they are- faded, worn, but back again.”•	“I’ve seen war. Peace is better.”•	“It’s proof that redemption is possible, when flowers blossom from the desert.”•	“There’s trouble that you’ve had, trouble that you presently have, and trouble that you’re going to have- that’s the world.”•	“It’s what happens, this life of ours. Piece by piece, it takes everything away from you.”•	“…numbers never lie; arithmetic is absolute.”•	“They own the game and the game is fixed, and it isn’t fixed for us.”A highlight of the text includes a moment where a character goes on a rant about government being the real organized crime family in the US, and it is 100% correct.

What a fun nonfiction ride this is! And it is perfect for reading in the blazing sun.There is a blurb on the cover of PIRATE HUNTERS that says, “A great thriller full of tough guys and long odds…and it really happened.” That blurb is dead on accurate. Essentially the book is about two men and their quest to find a famous pirate ship, the “Golden Fleece”. Those two men are John Chatterton and John Mattera, and the text is also a biography of sorts about them, and their lives are interesting enough to warrant that. These two are very fascinating and brilliantly mad men. The story of their lives, and the search for the ship, mingle together in a fun and informative read. It is gripping to read about Chatterton and Mattera. These dudes are men! Tough, brave, energetic, and adventurous. Quotes:•	“To Mattera, history was more than just a collection of old stories; it was an insight into human nature, a crystal ball that told as much about the future as it did about the past.”•	“…this was history-better than textbook stories of presidents and kings, because he could stand there; he could feel the place for himself. The feeling of a place was the reason to go.”•	“In this way, gold and silver performed alchemies of their own. By mixing with human instinct, they could even turn the pious base.”•	“Men came alive when they were made equal.”Especially notable was chapter 16, “The Battle”, which was an engaging section. It includes a detailed description of the mechanics of firing a cannon in the 1680s. And it is good reading! Detailed, yet not so technical that I could not follow it. Ditto for a description of a surgeon amputating limbs on a naval ship.Overall, the strongest thing about this text is the love of history that permeates very page.

No, I don’t want it.”This was my first work by Tolstoy. It won’t be my last. THE DEATH OF IVAN ILYICH is a book filled with universal truth and experience. If this was par for the course with Tolstoy, then I need more of him in my life. This version, translated by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky, is excellently done. And this text features an interesting, short introduction by Mr. Pevear which is worth reading.This novella begins with the death of the title character, gives us a brief experience of what that feels like to those who knew him, and then takes the reader back into Ivan’s life leading up to his death. Throughout, Tolstoy creates with such clarity the truth of human emotion. You don’t realize how true until the pang of personal recognition smacks you in the face. One such moment for me was when Ivan Ilyich acknowledges that he will die. We all say we know that it will happen, that it’s inevitable, but in our minds, we reject that notion. “Others die, not me.” It is uncanny how true to reality this invented character’s thoughts while dying are. The mark of a great writer is one who understands and can communicate the human condition. Tolstoy certainly does that in this book.Quotes:•	“…the very fact of the death of a close acquaintance called up in all those who heard of it, as always, a feeling of joy that it was he who was dead and not I.”•	“ ‘Why, that could come for me, too, right now, any minute’ he thought, and he was momentarily afraid.•	“And he became angry at the misfortune or at the people who had caused him the unpleasantness and were killing him; and he felt how this anger was killing him, but he could not repress it.”•	“And he had to live alone on the brink of disaster like that, without a single human being who could understand and pity him.”•	“Yes, there was life, and now it is going, going, and I cannot hold it back.”•	“He wept over his helplessness, over his terrible loneliness, over the cruelty of people, over the cruelty of God, over the absence of God.”•	“And what if my whole life, my conscious life, has indeed been ‘not right’?”There is a lot one could say about this text. I won’t waste time doing so. Read it. The final sentences are ripe with philosophical, religious, and metaphysical meaning. I’m not sure what the meant interpretation is, and I guess that’s the point.

It can’t be undone.” (4.5 stars)This was my first experience with a book by Adam Makos. It won’t be my last. In fact, I have already purchased another of his to add to my WW II reading pile. In terms of style and content it reminds me a lot of the work of another writer who focuses on WW II, Alex Kershaw. I picked up SPEARHEAD originally because of its focus on the American tank forces in Europe. Both of my grandfathers (in a rare coincidence) were in armored divisions in Europe in WW II, so I was immediately intrigued.Mr. Makos does an excellent job reinforcing the humanity and the non-war lives of common soldiers on both sides of the conflict. In fact, it is this text’s grounding in treating its subjects as real people, not as historical footnotes, that is this book’s greatest strength. It is also very well researched and written. The text follows a few subjects rather closely, and includes well drawn pictures of other soldiers who intersected their stories. Woven together it creates a gripping historical narrative that flows through Belgium and Germany along with the 3rd Armored Division during the last year of WW II.Some highlights of this text for me included:A moment where a tanker does not know how to pray so he simply “speaks’ to God during a harrowing night during the Battle of the Bulge. It’s stark humanity and truthfulness is stunning.After the war’s end a German POW recalls the comradeship he had with black GIs who worked in the kitchens with him. They even shared their rations with this prisoner.At that same camp this POW witnessed American GIs and German prisoners sing “Silent Night” on Christmas Eve in English and German. Gives the lyric, “sleep in heavenly peace” a different and powerful resonance.The texts includes many pictures and some simple yet effective maps. They are well placed and greatly enhance the narrative.Quotes:•	“War touches everyone.”•	“…war is an ugly business to be good at.”•	“The sound of everyone singing together told him it was true. The war really was over.” (This moment is referenced by me in the above highlights.)•	“The past could destroy the present- he had seen it happen before.”The final chapters of SPEARHEAD have a subtle elegiac feel. Adam Makos has written a full circle account of the events depicted. It makes for a satisfying experience for the reader. As most recent books about WW II do, this one ends with the final stories (deaths) of the people it depicts. Reminding the reader that the aspects of all of our stories are very different, but they all end the same.Thank you, Mr. Makos for so beautifully documenting yet another, of the countless thousands, of human stories from WW II....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Jul 22, 2023","Jul 28, 2023","Jul 22, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/52589144-spearhead

ORDINARY GRACE was my first experience with a novel by William Kent Krueger. I’ll read more of him.Minnesota, 1961. A formative and unforgettable year in the life of two young sons of a minister in the town of New Bremen. That’s enough plot rehash for me. I’ll focus on some aspects of the text that I greatly appreciated.First off, I loved the narrator (Frank) and his younger brother (Jake). They are boys who play outside, who have imaginations and do things that boys do. And it is through their childhood adventures, snooping, and observations that most of the novel’s plot points/twists are revealed.There is a heartbreaking moment where a young boy’s childlike faith is lost. Not for good, but the immature aspect of his faith is gone forever. It is truthfully rendered.Chapter 24 of this text depicts a sermon that the narrator’s father (a minister named Nathan Drum) delivers. It is astounding, and worth reading as a standalone piece. It shows a man in terrible circumstances leaning heavily into faith and accepting God’s will. It is an inspiring ideal.Overall, ORDINARY GRACE is an plaintive work. There are moments of sadness (deep sadness) and there is a slight melancholy that permeates much of the text, yet there is a simple and profound joy to be found in its pages.Quotes:•	“The town was dark and full of delicious possibility.”•	“I liked the general idea of being trustworthy and loyal and thrifty and brave and clean and reverent but the effort it took to hang in there with all those weighty virtues was usually more than I cared to muster.”•	“In the simple way of the wild daisies that grew in the grass of the pasture behind our home she offered the beauty of herself without pretension.”•	“I know I give you a hard time about your religion but damned if I’m not grateful that you believe it. Somebody’s got to.”•	“For each of us, the sun sets and the sun also rises and through the grace of our Lord we can endure our own dark night and rise to the dawning of a new day and rejoice.”•	“Word spreads with the incomprehensibility of magic and the speed of the plague.”•	“For me, God is at the heart of everything.”•	“You can leave everything behind except who you are.”•	“If we put everything in God’s hands, maybe we don’t any of us have to be afraid anymore.”•	“Some things we prefer remain lost in the shadows of our past.”This book is about the simple graces.

It’s a relatively short book, or I would have been more annoyed at my reading of it. STEALING REMBRANDTS-THE UNTOLD STORIES OF NOTORIOUS ART THEFTS is mainly about the theft of works of art by Rembrandt. In reading this text one quickly realizes that in the hands of different writers this would have been vastly more interesting. The text was coauthored and overall it is not that well written. The quality of the writing varies page by page.Ironically, the parts of the book that were least interesting are mostly those about the thefts of Rembrandts. They are for the most part confusingly written and often underdeveloped. The most interesting, and best executed, elements of the text are those sections that serve as mini histories/biographies of Rembrandt himself and his life and times. There were moments and some “characters” who I was engaged with or interested to read about in this text. And again it is not a bad book. I appreciate that it values the importance of art in culture. As the book ends it emphasizes, “As temporary caretakers (of Rembrandts’ work) it is our duty to make sure his works get handed down yet again, and only first to those who would do no harm.” A lovely point, and I will say that reading this has made me plan a few museum trips in my future.

In STAND INTO DANGER newly promoted 3rd Lieutenant Bolitho is assigned to the HMS frigate “Destiny” on a 18th century version of a secret mission. In pursuit of an English ex pat, and some lost Spanish gold, it is fast paced, and to the point.Some highlights of this text include the introduction of the character of Stockdale, who I remembered from my original reading of the series years ago. Also of note in this text is Bolitho’s first love, and the loss of his virginity, which interestingly enough I also remembered from my original reading, although I’m sure I saw it through much less romantic eyes now than I did then. Ha!A quibble is that stylistically the novel is sometimes too abrupt and on point. Not a lot of development of an idea, and occasionally it is jarring.Quotes:•	“Life is God’s greatest gift.

He made up or exaggerated half of the stuff in this memoir, at least. There is even a disclosure (in small print) on the copyright page that admits as much. The last two sections of this book are egregious and blatant falsehoods, which at best are attempts to create a pertinent truth, and more than likely manipulative appeals. Mr. Cantú could have written truthfully about issues with the American/Mexico border, but it was more important to insert himself into the story. I for one was not impressed.The book is most interesting when Cantú focuses (all too briefly) on the history of the US/Mexican border. Its creation and evolution over the years to its modern lines. Alas, there is not a lot of this.The book is at its worst when Cantú tries to be a poet. It feels like MFA writing. Writing meant to impress, but not to impart. A big fail. There is also this focus where the author tries to convince us that he has these dreams that parallel his experiences with the border in a deeply metaphorical way. Except they are so obviously made up (MFA writing) that the falsehood is annoying. The last 80 pages of the book are consumed by a story whose veracity I doubt. It is too convenient to his thesis to be 100% true. I suspect it’s an amalgamation of lots of events that he weaves into a narrative that he thinks gives power and purpose to his finale.

It is an engaging and very informative read. The text explains with great detail the nuances of the ideas and thoughts of these two men. In today’s world where we glam onto 1 or 2 aspects of a person and use it to define their whole self, this take is really refreshing.The opening chapter “Contrasts” is an excellent set up of the differences between these two men. It set the stage for what follows. Consider these two descriptions of them:Jefferson-“Be a listener only, keep within yourself, and endeavor to establish with yourself the habit of silence, especially in politics.Adams- “…fearless of men and of the consequences of a bold assertion of opinion in all his speeches.”Talk about a different take on something!When author Gordon Wood examines their views on republicanism and the success of a national republic it is obvious that these two could not have been more correct. They both anticipated “a time, and that not a distant one, when corruption…will have seized the heads of government and be spread by them through the body of the people.” It is breathtaking as one takes in their genius and astute observations about government and human nature. The book contains a wonderful examination on the views of a Republic, and also the philosophical foundations of “all men are created equal.” It is enlightening reading.One cannot read this text without being continually amazed at the relevance and prescience about America that the founders possessed. They still understand us better than we understand ourselves. It’s astounding. John Adams was especially prophetic and accurate in his thoughts on the disaster that the French Revolution became and its consequences. He also correctly predicted what the party system would do to American politics. When these men worried about the vocal “few exerting influence over the many” they could not have predicted the fallout of this current woke nonsense in any more accurate fashion.Quotes:•	”Without virtue and self-sacrifice, republics would fall apart.” (TJ)•	“How could any man judge unless his mind had been opened and enlarged by reading?” (JA)•	“…wisdom and knowledge, as well as virtue, diffused generally among the body of the people were necessary for their rights and liberties.” (JA)•	“Every society has inequalities which no human legislator ever can eradicate.” (JA)•	“I like a little rebellion now and then. It is like a storm in the atmosphere.” (TJ)•	“The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time by the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is its natural manure.” (TJ)•	“…always an honest man, often a great one, but sometimes absolutely mad.” (Ben Franklin about John Adams)•	“…not all equally strong, wise, handsome, active, but equal in the sight of God. Equal in rights and obligations. Nothing more.” (JA)•	“Take away hope and what remains?” (JA)•	“Great is truth, and it will prevail.” (JA)•	“Power must never be trusted without a Check.” (JA)•	“Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passion, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.” (JA)I will warn that this book is not for the casual reader. Gordon Wood is a historian, and he can get a little wonky. The chapter “Constitutions” is an example. Its exploration of various state constitutions and the manner in which they affected the federal one has depth. I’m not a casual reader, and it occasionally pushed my limits.The book winds down on some very high notes. The chapter “Reconciliation” is awesome reading. There is a lot to digest in its pages. And the final chapter is a brilliant summation. FRIENDS DIVIDED explores with depth the philosophical underpinnings of Adams and Jefferson and their actions. In exploring this aspect of these men we get to know them. It is not a traditional biography in the giving of the details of their everyday lives. I learned a lot about these great men (who I have read much about already) in its pages. It is a worthwhile read.

Shakespeare and his companions are caught up, accidently at first, in the intrigues and plots that consumed the Pope and the court of Elizabeth the 1st. I enjoyed this more than its predecessor, but not so much for the plot, as for the clever manner in which Shakespeare’s later life is integrated into the story. Mr. Brandreth is at moments a really insightful writer. He weaves into this narrative observations about the writing of Shakespeare that are very well done and have thoughtful depth.For me, the main pleasure of this book is the cleverness with which the author incorporates and winks at Shakespeare’s works. There are numerous allusions and subtle references to Shakespeare’s work, as well as nods to other historical and classical references made throughout the text. Here are a couple of examples. -	There is a witty joke made with what would become one of Shakespeare’s most quoted lines, “Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day”. He tries to impress a women with it, and she dismisses it as cliché. It made me chuckle.-	At one point, the plot points of the book loosely resemble elements of Shakespeare’s play TWELFTH NIGHT. Shakespeare muses while observing the things around him that if only minor tweaks to the “real life” situation around him were made it would be far more interesting.-	The novel’s dénouement is brought about by an adroit plot twist connected to Shakespeare’s innate observations and understanding of human nature.Quotes:•	“All thought of consequence was banished, for a young man longs to feel his strength.”•	“How the life of the mind might roam as freely as a bachelor did, tasting as it willed, where it willed.”•	“No woman could meet such weight of expectation as lies in your eyes.”•	“To be unfortunate in love, come, sir, you know ‘tis common.”•	“There always seems another time, and another, until you find that time has wasted you.”•	“I have never been so alone as to have once been in her company and now to lack it.”•	“Old fools think they have it still.”•	“Have a care for others. Yours is not the only suffering in the world.”•	“You who have such power to understand others’ thoughts and feelings. How is it you are so confounded by your own?”•	“To care, was in the end, to grieve.”•	“It’s a cruel thing to learn how vile a thing is a man.”•	“…we wish our cares were held in as high regard by others.”•	“Sorrow without hope leads on to madness.”THE ASSASSIN OF VERONA ends on a fascinating (and bleak) note. Without giving anything away, I’m not sure what to think of it, but it is very intriguing, and speaks of the author’s foresight while crafting this novel and its predecessor. I’m a sucker for novels about Shakespeare, and Mr. Brandreth is clearly a man who knows the works, and I would even say to some extent the mind, of the Bard well.

The book’s structure lends itself very well to the audio format, and the large cast of actors performing it keeps it from getting dull, or feeling the same. It felt like I was watching a documentary (which is the point) without the visuals. The cast does an awesome job, and listening to this as opposed to reading has flavored my rating, I’m sure. The plot is essentially a transcript of a documentary about a band that was huge in the late seventies, and then broke up. Their personal lives intersect, and although the exploration of their lives is surface level, there is something that lurks underneath that gives the characters a more dimensional feel. Again, was this due to the actor’s performance on the audio, and would I have felt that characterization if only looking at the page…don’t know.I really enjoyed the character of Billy Dunne, the leader of the band “The Six”. There was a genuineness and a desire in him to love the things in life that really matter (family, children, defeating one’s demons) that appealed to me. He is a good guy. On the other hand, I detested Daisy Jones. She is a spoiled child who kind of accidentally finds herself a leading member of ""The Six"", and her influence and presence ultimately (although perhaps not her fault) leads to the band’s demise. I think she is kind of an awful person. I can’t figure out if the author (Taylor Jenkins Reid) thinks so too or not. And perhaps that’s the point. And the character of Camila, Billy Dunne’s wife, was my favorite. Many of the best lines in the book are hers. She is a modern day version of Melanie Wilkes from GONE WITH THE WIND. A truly decent human.Quotes:•	“There’s a peace that comes with knowing you have a person in the world who would do anything for you, that you would do anything for.”•	“…someone who insists on the perfect conditions to make art isn’t an artist. They’re an asshole.”•	“When you find that rare person who really knows who you are and they still don’t love you…”•	“I’m saying that when you really love someone, sometimes the things they need may hurt you, and some people are worth hurting for.”•	“But you don’t tell other people’s stories.”•	“But if you get to be my age and you can’t look back at your life and wonder about some of your choices…well you have no imagination.”•	“I think you have to have faith in people before they earn it, Otherwise it’s not faith, right?”•	“The truth often lies, unclaimed, in the middle.”•	“If a friend lied to me the way I lie to myself, I’d say, ‘You’re a shitty friend’.”•	“All I will say is you show up for your friends on their hardest days.”•	“Life is about who is holding your hand and, I think, whose hand you commit to holding.”•	“I can’t think of any two things that make you quite as self-absorbed as addiction and heartbreak.”There were more than a few moments where I was really struck by something that a character said, as I felt it was a truthful expression of human experience. Those moments, some indicated in the above list, could be jarring. In a good way.I intend to return to DAISY JONES AND THE SIX in a few years, but this time as a traditional reading experience.

You’re doing fine.” While still in the first chapter of this book I had to put it down and step away for a bit. Mr. Haruf was terrifyingly good in his ability to capture the emotional truth of a moment. By page 13 I had had tears in my eyes numerous times already. I don’t often cry while reading, but Haruf moves me like few other writers that I have encountered. The reason for the tears, which happened often while reading BENEDICTION, is because it captures with heartbreaking accuracy moments that we have all lived.One of the things I most loved about this book is that in this novel Mr. Haruf reinforces the notion that you never know the whole story until you hear both sides of it, and even then you still don’t fully know it. In ways subtle and dramatic, BENEDICTION reminds the reader of this truth.At one point a character says he is hoping to recapture “The precious ordinary.” This is what Haruf does in his books, and it is why he is great and why he will endure. I live the ordinary, and so do you.Here are some moments in the text that reflect the precious ordinary that have stuck with me:-	There is an instance where a wife gives her dying husband a sponge bath. Having recently seen death up close, this beautiful moment rang painfully true.-	In chapter 17 we get a depiction of a small town 4th of July. It is unassuming, human, and lovely, and the writing in this chapter is simplistically stunning.-	There is a quick and touching cameo mention of the McPheron brothers and their ranch in this text. It is powerful because the McPherons (who loomed large in the first two books of this trilogy) are absent from this one, and in the same small town to those who did not really know them, their lives were not that consequential. But they were consequential to me. I loved them. And that is life. We make a ripple in our sphere of influence, but in the bigger picture…not even noticed. Some quotes from the text:•	“I don’t want you to go yet, she said.”•	“The air was cool and smelled fresh of the country in the evening out on the high plains.”•	“If you have love you can live in this world in a true way and if you love each other you can see past everything and accept what you don’t understand and forgive what you don’t know or you don’t like.”•	“You’re dreaming backward.”•	“….remembering everything, taking all of his years into account.”•	“It’s how people are when somebody’s dying. They want to forget the past. Forgive things.”•	“Because he’s old and dying doesn’t mean he knows anything.”•	“I’m getting along the best I can.”•	“All life is moving through some kind of unhappiness, isn’t it.”•	“I missed a lot of things. I could have done better.”•	“You’ve been everything to me.”•	“People like her make me real tired.”Kent Haruf published 6 novels. I have now read 4 of them. I am very hesitant to read the last two. After that, there are no more. The PLAINSONG trilogy are among the best reads I have encountered in my time on earth. Stunning, simple, satisfying. Like Thornton Wilder’s brilliant OUR TOWN, they celebrate the real things. The small things. The very precious things. These words form BENEDICTION are about as good as any others I could say to conclude this  and this journey with the natives of Holt, Colorado. “I just wanted to look at this place one last time. For sentimental reasons, I suppose. We can go now.”...more",Notes are private!,0,65,1,"Apr 30, 2023","May 06, 2023","Apr 30, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15762186-benediction

So when I saw this biography of Wild Bill Hickok, I thought, “Why not?” It had been years since I thought of the man, and reading this text brought many of the memories of him that had faded in my mind back to the forefront. It took me about 40 pages to get into this book, and suddenly I was engaged. The more I read the more I liked. The book grows on the reader.In WILD BILL: THE TRUE STORY OF THE AMERICAN FRONTIER’S FIRST GUNFIGHTER Tom Clavin gives almost as much attention to the people whose lives intersected with Wild Bill’s as he does to his titular subject. This book is about a person, but also about a period and its people. And they were fascinating people! I loved this organization/structure choice for the text. Quotes:•	""He had risen to the heights of both reputation and fabrication…and now the slow, inexorable descent began. Like a Hamlet or Macbeth or any other of Shakespeare’s tragic heroes, there would be no escaping his fate.”•	“That I have killed men I admit, but never unless in absolute self-defense, or in the performance of an official duty.”•	“When a man believes the bullet isn’t molded that is going to kill him, what in hell has he got to be afraid of?”One aspect of this book that I enjoyed was the exploration of the relationship between Wild Bill Hickok and Buffalo Bill Cody. They had an intriguing and long term friendship that I was not aware of.A quibble with the text is its lack of a Notes section. I’m not sure that everything I read in this text was true. Mr. Clavin talks freely about some of the false legends surrounding Wild Bill, but I wonder if some of them did not creep in to what he claims as fact. Who knows? But a Notes (and more robust Bibliography) would have made me feel better about it.In short, I’m glad I picked up WILD BILL.

I think my biggest issue with it was that it was written by an author to coincide with a television production she was writing, and I think the novel lacks a little as a result. It was not given the full treatment so to speak. The novel’s characterization and development feel very surface level to me. Much like they would be in a television script until an actor fleshes them out.I did enjoy the narration of Anna Wilson Jones, who had a felicity with the German accents required by many of the characters and offered subtle shifts of tone to depict different characters. Considering that the writing is average, her performance is even more noteworthy.Quotes:•	“Is that all I must look forward to? Comfort? I think I should prefer to be happy.” “As you grow older, there is a lot to be said for being comfortable, ma’am. But I don’t expect you to believe me. When I was your age, I too wanted to be happy.”•	“There is nothing wrong in talking quietly; it only makes people listen harder.”•	“In the end to add to the sum of human knowledge is the only thing a man can be truly proud of.”There are occasional moments where there was a genuine spark to this text. One moment that comes to mind is a scene where Queen Victoria and her future husband Albert fall for each other while playing a duet on the piano. It is rendered with a loveliness that made me smile. However, despite those random flashes, I found this overall to be a quite average read. I listened to it while walking the dog, so I’m no worse for the wear, but it seemed to be very standard romance lit historical fiction....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Apr 17, 2023","May 07, 2023","Apr 17, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/30516969-victoria

Mr. Haruf writes about the “flyover” people, as our media would call them. “Deplorables”, as our politicians would call them. But Mr. Haruf renders them truthfully and fully. They are reality. They are flawed, and heartbreakingly beautiful in their daily struggles.EVENTIDE is a follow-up (of sorts) to Haruf’s brilliant novel PLAINSONG. Although not as brilliant as PLAINSONG, EVENTIDE is no less good. Part I of the novel establishes the characters for us. Returning from the first book are the McPheron brothers. These men are among my favorite literary creations of all time. I love them! This description of a typical end to a day for the brothers is a perfect rendering of them, and also a great example of Haruf’s melancholy tinged writing. “At ten o’clock they turned on the old console television to catch whatever news there might be showing from somewhere else in the world before they climbed up the stairs and lay down tired in their beds, each in his own memories and thoughts.”Introduced in this text are Luther and Betty Wallace and their two children. Poor, ignorant, probably slightly developmentally disabled, they remind the reader that all people have deep humanity, even those we are loathe to look upon. Finally there is 11 year old DJ Kephart, an orphan living with, and taking care of, his grandfather.And with these characters as linchpins, Mr. Haruf creates a novel teeming with the beauty and sadness that makes up this journey we call life.Often while reading this book I would discover that a tear or two had snuck out of my eyes and made its way down my cheeks. This book is not sad (despite some brutal and uncomfortable moments) but is beautifully elegiac. It realistically recreates that middle place between great joy and deep sorrow that most of us exist in most of the time.Quotes:•	“He wanted to think of words that would make some difference but there were none in any language he knew that were sufficient to the moment or that would change a single thing. They stayed quiet for some time.”•	“You shouldn’t be alone too much.”•	“It don’t seem to matter at all what we like. It’s how things are.”•	“But every living thing in this world gets weaned eventually.”•	“And now outside the house, beyond the silent room they sat in, the dark began to collect along the street.”The last 30 pages of this novel are just one emotional gut punch after another. Mr. Haruf writes such real people that their agonies hurt. But EVENTIDE is not tragic. It is just a realistic depiction of the pain that is sometimes found in being a human.

There are lots of things one might feel about A GOOD DAY TO DIE, but one thing that I would think any reader of it would agree on is that Jim Harrison was an interesting (if not very talented) writer.In this book an unnamed narrator goes on a cross-country trip with two other companions. One a drug addled Vietnam veteran, and the other the woman who loves said vet. Their goal is to blow up dams in the American West. These wannabe eco terrorists are deeply troubled individuals. Our unnamed narrator is a vastly interesting character as Mr. Harrison reveals small bits of his backstory throughout the book, but never enough about him to create a completely full, or even remotely accurate, picture of the man. And yet the bits about him that are revealed are consistently interesting. He has a kid, he is (or was) married, he is well travelled, he reads D.H. Lawrence, etc.I think the thing I liked most about this book, published in 1973, is that I’m not sure it would be published in today’s censorious environment. These characters are not woke, they are not sanitized versions of eco terrorists. They are real people. Real disgusting people. Who they really are would contradict the modern (false) narrative of their eco agenda. Thus, it could not be shared. “Sensitive” (and by that I mean censors) editors would not publish it.Quotes:•	“She was an as#$*!e and I couldn’t have loved her at gunpoint.”•	“…I felt very melancholy pondering all the little cheats people pull on one another.”•	“Perhaps the movies have an eternal stranglehold on me as I either fall “in love” at first sight or not at all.”•	“It is so easy to become fatigued with love.”•	“So many good women fall in love with maniacs I thought.”•	“I’ve always wondered how people who don’t know anything about history get by, but I’ve realized if you are ignorant of history you’re not lost in it.”•	“I reflected stupidly on how much everyone needed the night to give at least the appearance of a fresh start.”•	“How could she be a foot away and still so distant?”•	“I wasn’t use to questioning the essential truth of the way I lived.”•	“Being oblique and directionless is the least attractive characteristic if you want to get screwed. A moron will get laid a lot if he has the self-assurance of an average ward heeler.”•	“I knew in my drunkenness that I had lost any remnant of control and would somehow merely have to wait and see what I would do.”The final realization that our narrator has is about as honest a self-reflection as a person could have about themselves. It is a perfect ending for this text. A GOOD DAY TO DIE is one of the more intriguing reads that I have had in a while, and for that alone it was worth the trip through its 176 pages....more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"Apr 09, 2023","Apr 12, 2023","Apr 09, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/421352.A_Good_Day_to_Die

THE DIARY OF A BOOKSELLER is just“Philately will get you nowhere in The Book Shop.” (3.5 stars)Never has there been a more truthful title for a book. THE DIARY OF A BOOKSELLER is just that. Bookshop owner Shaun Bythell, the owner of “The Book Shop” in Wigtown, Scotland kept a diary for 1 year, and this is it. The text features the daily entries from Feb. 4, 2014 to Feb. 4, 2015. Bythell also writes a brief opening essay before each month’s entries. And that’s it. That’s the book. And it was interesting. At least to me.Some random thoughts about the read:I did not find Mr. Bythell to be as mean spirited as some other readers of this book did. I found most of his observations about some of his more “charming” customers to be without any real malice. Or maybe I just share in his opinion that most folks are excruciating. I could not stand Bythell’s shop assistant, Nicky. Something about this lady vexed me to no end. I think we are supposed to find her quirky. I found her irritating. But clearly there is something about her that Bythell enjoys, so good on him.At one point Bythell writes, “This life is infinitely preferable to working for someone else.” If there is a better reason for being a bookseller I’ve never heard it!I found it vastly interesting to see the ebbs and flows of the year. Seasons and weather play such a fascinating role in retail. Quotes:•	“Really bookish people are a rarity, although there are vast numbers of those who consider themselves to be such.”•	“Of course, one person’s good book is another person’s bad book; the matter is entirely subjective.”•	“…a dying breed who understand that, if they want bookshops to survive, they have to support them.”•	“A big ginger conundrum.”•	“…and instead merely reflect rudeness back at people who are rude to me.”•	“At 10 AM the first customer came through the door: ‘I’m not really interested in books’ followed by ‘Let me tell you what I think about nuclear power.’ By 10:30 AM the will to live was but a distant memory.”This was an beguiling reading experience.

I have read 4 of his books now, and have more on my “to read” pile. And I have mostly enjoyed the reads, but I don’t enjoy him. NOTES FROM A SMALL ISLAND is a travelogue through Great Britain, and although it gets repetitive (Bryson seems to say the same thing about every little town he goes through) and it does read as a little dated (originally published in 1995) I am no worse the wear for reading it. Plus I got to experience, a least a little, some moments in places I will likely never go to.Some positive observations first. The text is funny at times. Mr. Bryson has a very dry and sarcastic sense of humor. There is also lots of euphemistic language and understatement employed to great effect. Another highlight of the read is chapter 17 where Mr. Bryson visits the village of Bradford and goes to see a vintage film called “This is Cinerama.” His joy in this place and moment just made me happy. His enthusiasm in describing this experience is contagious and infiltrates the reader. The book also ends with a lovely ode to the Yorkshire Dales, and it is a perfect conclusion to the text.Quotes:•	“…the sort of person your P.E. teacher warned that you would turn into if you masturbated too extravagantly (someone, in short, like your P.E. teacher).•	“The world, or at least this little corner of it, seemed a good and peaceful place, and I was immensely glad to be there.”•	“Nothing gives the English more pleasure, in a quiet but determined sort of way, than to do things oddly.”•	“I watched the rain beat down on the road outside and told myself that one day this would be twenty years ago.”•	“Britain is, for all its topographical diversity and timeless majesty, an exceedingly small-scale place.”•	“Oh I don’t think so, dear,” said the woman with the certainty of stupidity, and bestowed a condescending smile.”•	“Can there anywhere on earth be, in such a modest span, a landscape more packed with centuries of busy, productive attainment?”•	“I realized what it was that I loved about Britain-which is to say, all of it.”A recurring issue that I have with Mr. Bryson is that he is often too sarcastic and mean for my tastes. There is a hint of nastiness that seems to hang around the edges of most of his actions and observations. And just as you want to tell him to ‘sod off’ he will write endearingly about a place that he found lovely despite its bad reputation and you delay throwing the book across the room. A great example of this is when he wrote about his visit to the town of Wigan.I have more Bryson on my radar, including the follow up book to this text, and NOTES FROM A SMALL ISLAND has not given me a reason to dismiss them....more",Notes are private!,0,39,1,"Mar 19, 2023","Mar 31, 2023","Mar 19, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/906778.Notes_from_a_Small_Island

But this is not a story, and it does not have a point. I don’t know what this novel was about. I’m not sure Ms. Flagg does either. It feels like she wrote it because it would make money, as it seems to be part of a loosely connected series. Plot (such as it is), a town is founded by some immigrants, they start a graveyard, it fills up over the years until the town essentially disintegrates around 2019. And the dead talk to each other in the graveyard, until they disappear in what seems to be a Buddhist reincarnation claptrap Epilogue.The book is sentimental schlock of the worst sort. And I’m a sentimental sap, but this is too much. Every women in this novel says some variation of, “Oh so and so, I’m so happy” or “Oh so and so, I love you so much”, or some stupid sentiment that begins with a sighing uttered “Oh”.Gag!Quotes:•	“But something had happened. Something called America. And there was now hope in the world.”•	“It takes time and a lot of suffering, but sometimes, when you least expect it, life has a strange way of working out.”One of the final chapters, “Macky is Worried”, kind of redeemed the book for me. A character bemoans the lack of patriotism in America, as well as the amount of cultural ignorance about her past and about her future. Essentially it is a takedown of what we now call cancel and woke culture. Two things I detest. If I had not been listening to the audio version I would have put the book down.

I’m done with Hilary Mantel’s Cromwell trilogy. It’s astounding.THE MIRROR & “Are you innocent, if you set up the damage for yourself?”Wow!That’s it. I’m done with Hilary Mantel’s Cromwell trilogy. It’s astounding.THE MIRROR & THE LIGHT begins seconds after the beheading of Anne Boleyn. This is a seductive book. It pulls you in with its stylized writing and intriguing plot development, and then for 757 pages it does not let you go. This novel is about Thomas Cromwell, but Hilary Mantel is also a star of this show. I was aware of her authorial presence all along while still being immersed in the world she created with her words. I am not sure how to explain it, but it’s there, and it’s a good thing.This novel is haunted by ghosts. Ms. Mantel threads seamlessly into the narrative remembrances and effects of Thomas More, Cardinal Wolsey, Cromwell’s father Walter (a terrifying presence), Katherine of Aragorn, Anne Boleyn (and the many that went down with her) and others into a mosaic of the past and present that is always under the surface and constantly affecting the decisions and actions of Thomas Cromwell in the present. At one point he muses, “The dead are more faithful than the living. For better or worse, they do not leave you. They last out the longest night.” Without being obvious or intrusive one is constantly reminded in this book just how much the past influences the present.Mantel depicts Cromwell’s subtle changes with efficiency and nuance. As you are reading you realize they have crept up on you and have been fully integrated into your understanding of the character, but you would be hard pressed to point out when this happened.One thing the close reader of this text will appreciate are all of the little hints that Mantel drops throughout the book that will play larger roles as Cromwell’s descent begins in full swing. Just as in this novel’s predecessors, her ability to weave these things seamlessly into the narrative is indicative of reality. Most things we do/say don’t have significance at the time they happen. It is later that their importance develops. Quotes:•	“But if you cannot speak the truth at a beheading, when can you speak it?”•	“Go forward, sir. It’s the one direction God permits.”•	“Those who think a heart cannot break have led blessed and sheltered lives.”•	“In obedience there is strength and tranquility.”•	“But it is the present you must reckon with.”•	“You can persuade the quick to think again, but you cannot remake your reputation with the dead.”•	“…this is what I know: right is what you can get away with, and wrong is what they whip you for.”•	“Sudden pleasure afflicts like sudden pain, and leaves you dizzy, numb.”•	“We never know how to take it when our life begins to be charmed.”•	“I can see why good men want to believe that Christ is coming. We want His justice, when justice seems so long delayed.”•	“Even the worst poets, from time to time, hit on a felicitous phrasing.”•	“You cannot greet the world in the morning with anything less than ferocity, or by evening you will be destroyed.”The intricacy with which Mantel depicts the shift of Cromwell’s fall from the graces of Henry VIII is well done. Like most relationships where the bloom falls off the rose, the drifting apart sneaks up on them (seemingly) suddenly, and then appears to take forever to fully disintegrate.Having completed the three novels in this series, I can’t say that I preferred one over the other, and I would not attempt to rank them. All I can say is that taken as a unit they form a triumphant whole! It is a brilliant opus that reeks of authenticity, humanity, and much more. Towards the end of the novel Cromwell realizes that “He must traverse his whole life, waking and sleeping: you cannot leave your memories alone in the world for other men to own.” Ms. Mantel is sadly gone now, there will be no more books from her. But I’m glad she left these bits for us to own....more",Notes are private!,2,68,1,"Mar 07, 2023","Mar 18, 2023","Mar 07, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45992717-the-mirror-the-light

It is only the second audiobook I have ever consumed. I believe I liked this book much more listening to Mr. Short read it than I ever would have reading it on my own. Some random observations:One of the best things about this was listening to it as an audiobook. Short’s reading/tone/inflection (especially when he's recounting childhood things that he said to his mother) is delightful to listen to. I really enjoyed being able to hear “character” voices and the different inflections he used when quoting others.I liked the book. However, by the last two discs (it is 7 CDs) I was getting tired of it. It was just a little bit too much name dropping, a little bit too much “I'm trying to be humble, but you can tell that I'm not”. It gets old. I think that's just a problem with the genre of memoir. By the time I got to the last disc I was ready for this book to be done. The incessant name dropping, and ego driven naval gazing of the worst kind just detracts so much from a book that was so much better the first half. I like the guy, a lot. But I think he has vastly overestimated his footprint.When Mr. Short details the death of his wife, I of course feel pity and sadness for him but his constant references to trips to St. Bart’s, and flights on private planes, and doctors who open clinics on the weekends just for them grated on me. I know many people who have died of cancer, and they didn't have any of those things. The section felt very callous to me, which is ironic, because it is at this point in his life story I should have felt the most sympathy/empathy for Mr. Short. Yet, because of the way he presented it, it was the part of the text where I disliked him most. His flaunting (unintentionally perhaps) of his wealth and advantage removed him. I don’t think that is what he wanted. He could have relayed the essence of all they were able to do during this period of life without emphasizing the exclusivity and privilege of it so much. The text’s last chapter is lovely. In it Short imagines a conversation that he has with his wife four years after she's passed as he is sitting on the deck of their home. It's tender and sweet. I enjoyed listening to I MUST SAY: MY LIFE AS A HUMBLE COMEDY LEGEND as an audio text. I think that reading it, I would not have enjoyed it at all. And that is on me.

I enjoyed the first book, A MAN NAMED DOLL, quite a bit. This one left me feeling empty. The text starts out with a fun noir feel. The daughter of an old flame asks Happy to find her junkie, homeless mother. In the first novel, and in the first part of this one, I loved Happy’s “voice."" Witty and self-deprecating. But then that “voice’ seems to disappear as the author gets caught up in one ridiculousness after another. At this point in the novel, the text seems to lose its voice and its rhythm, and it never regains it. It just descends into violence upon more violence. Barreling along violently to its abrupt conclusion. The book is only 216 pages, so it comes up quick. Part II in this novel is not at all plausible. This is often the case in the genre of crime fiction, but in this instance it is not only implausible, but it feels implausible as well.

Ms. Millard’s awe and respect for nature is apparent in this book. Chapter 12 (The Living Jungle) is a highlight as we get a naturalists take on the Amazon. The insane amount of knowledge dumped on the reader in this book is stimulating, awe inspiring, and sometimes cringy. Chapter 13 (Ink Black River) contains a section that I defy any man to read and not squirm when Millard shares some tidbits about the Candiru. (If you know, you know). The Amazon, river and jungle, is the most important and the most interesting “character” in this book. And Millard brings it to vivid life.This text is about an expedition that Teddy Roosevelt took in 1914 to explore an unchartered tributary of the Amazon know as the River of Doubt. The author explores the expedition and the people who undertook it chronologically, all the whole telling the “story” of the nature the expedition is working its way through. It is a narrative of adventure, of civilizations, of history, and geography and all weaved through a tale of the human capacity for endurance.Some highlights:* Ms. Millard deftly navigates the prejudices of the period without getting bogged down in 21st century mores. A skill that only the best of historians value and possess.* The sections about the Cinta Larga tribe are very intriguing. The Cinta Larga remained a Stone Age people well into the 1960s. Mankind was flying to the moon, and at the same time their isolation in the Amazon had them living in the manner of thousands of years ago. That is vastly fascinating!* The thoughtful examination of the other men who undertook this expedition with Roosevelt. He may be the one we all remember, but Millard gives the entire group its due. Quotes:•	“…but only on condition that each works with might and main to so maintain himself as not to be a burden to others.”•	“Even more disturbing than what they knew was what they did not know.”•	“He talked endlessly and on all conceivable subjects.” (about Roosevelt)•	“Death and dangers, in spite of how much suffering they bring, should not interfere with the expedition’s mission.”•	“In its intense and remorseless competition for every available nutrient, the Amazon offered little just for the taking.”•	“The very pathetic myth of ‘beneficent nature’ could not deceive even the least wise being if he once saw for himself the iron cruelty of life in the tropics.”•	“The River of Doubt, moreover, was one of the worst places on earth to be sick.”•	“Only those are fit to live who do not fear to die.”•	“For outsiders who are forced to spend lengthy periods in the rain forest, one of its most oppressive and frequently mentioned features is its relentless monotony.”•	“…in the delicately balanced, constantly evolving reality of the tropical rain forest, nothing ever remains the same.”THE RIVER OF DOUBT was a good read. I have now read two of Millard’s books and I will certainly read her others. In this text she brought to life the Roosevelt-Rondon Scientific Expedition and its journey. A journey so spectacular that no one was able to successful do the same thing again for another 12 years after its completion. Large personalities, world’s colliding, the awesomeness of nature, bravery, and cowardice. It’s all here in this text. Take the journey!...more",Notes are private!,0,54,1,"Feb 17, 2023","Feb 25, 2023","Feb 17, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/25773153-the-river-of-doubt

Her death just hurts, and I decided to try out Mr. Lewis as a complement to my prayer and devotional life as another tool to navigate this season.First off, both of the text’s introductions are good reading in their own right. They are by Madeleine L’Engle and Douglas Gresham. Consider these thoughts from them-Ms. L’Engle:•	“What we work out in our journals we don’t take out on family and friends.”•	“But our memories, precious though they are, still are like sieves, and the memories inevitably leak through.”•	“It gives us permission to admit our own doubts, our own angers and anguishes, and to know that they are part of the soul’s growth.”Mr. Gresham:•	“This book is a man emotionally naked in his own Gethsemane.”•	“…for the greater the love the greater the grief, and the stronger the faith the more savagely will Satan storm its fortress.”In this text, culled from journals that he wrote in the aftermath of his wife’s death from cancer, Mr. Lewis has intellectually and honestly dealt with Christian grief, and although it may not be for all, it was good for me.Some thoughts/moments that stand out, and made me pause and ponder as I read them include:1.	The idea of how we remake the memory of those we mourn into our own images. We make their memory serve our own purposes, as opposed to who they actually were.2.	The brutal honesty with which Lewis admits his anger at the false hopes that he had through his wife’s illness, and how he struggled when put to the test of trusting in divine will.3.	Chapter 3 is ferociously honest and true and very theologically deep. Deep not in the sense of the depth of its content, but in the depth of its raw emotion. Here is a sampling of thoughts/quotes from the text. So much I could have chosen:•	“And no one ever told me about the laziness of grief.”•	“I sometimes think that shame, mere awkward, senseless shame, does as much towards preventing good acts and straightforward happiness as any of our vices do.”•	“One only meets each hour or moment that comes.”•	“You can’t really share someone else’s weakness, or fear or pain.”•	“Only a real risk tests the reality of a belief.”•	“You never know how much you really believe anything until its truth or falsehood becomes a matter of life and death to you.”•	“And the past is the past and that is what time means, and time itself is one more name for death.”•	“Of course it is different when the thing happens to oneself, not to others, and in reality, not in imagination.”•	“For in grief nothing ‘stays put’.”•	“Sorrow, however, turns out to be not a state but a process.”•	“Praise is the mode of love which always has some element of joy in it.”•	“I need Christ, not something that resembles Him.”•	“Not my idea of God, but God.”•	“The best is perhaps what we understand least.”•	“How wicked it would be, if we could, to call the dead back!”I would encourage any reader to stick with the text. It grows on itself and gets better as it goes along. You will see Lewis’, and hopefully your own, process as you journey with him through these feelings. The last ten pages are one astounding concept/thought after another!Reading A GRIEF OBSERVED was helpful to me in this time of loss.

Each was a book that had me in the palm of its hand, despite varying levels of quality among them.Favorite rereads: ""The Road” (Cormac McCarthy) and “Pericles” (Shakespeare). Both have such beauty in the midst of pain. I only read 11 nonfiction this year. A mentioned, I enjoyed “The First Wave”, and already have more of Mr. Kershaw’s books on my “to read” pile. I also read Robert K. Massie’s “Peter the Great” and learned a lot about a period and place I knew very little about. I will also be reading more of his output. Three of my nonfiction reads were Nathaniel Philbrick’s trilogy about the American Revolution. Although they varied in quality, taken as a whole it was a good series. Biggest 'meh' reads of the year: “Hello Molly” (Molly Shannon) and “A Very Punchable Face” (Colin Jost). Both memoirs by people from a television show I don’t watch. The fault is my own.Most disappointing book and one I should have put down: “Severance” (Ling Ma) is just not interesting at all. Such a bad taste in my mouth months later. Best Surprises of the Year: “Beartown” (Fredrik Backman) and “Fish Out of Water"" (Eric Metaxes) were two books I greatly enjoyed. One a major fiction novel and the other a memoir from a very smart (and a little arrogant) intellectual. Both really captured me, unexpectedly so. I continue my way thru Daniel Silva's Gabriel Allon series. I read # 15 in that series this past year, “The English Spy”. They are smart books, have an element of legitimacy, are fast paced thrillers, and Silva is a decent writer. I read 3 plays in 2022. Two of Bill Shakespeare’s (“All’s Well That Ends Well” and “Pericles”) were rereads for me. I enjoyed them more the second time around than I did originally. Other misc. observations:-I read 4 more Larry McMurtry books in 2022. All four from his Duane Moore / Thalia saga. One was not so good, and the other three were fine to good. ""Texasville""""Duane’s Depressed""""When the Light Goes""“Rhino Ranch”It was very cool to spend so much time with one character, inhabiting his world. It was very immersive. I enjoyed that aspect a lot.-I reread Sherman Alexie’s “The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven” this year. He is such an intriguing writer. -I returned to Tim Dorsey’s Serge A. Storms series this summer. Reading it on the beach which is the perfect place to consume it. They are usually good for a laugh. ""No Sunscreen for the Dead"".I decided that for 2022 I was going to focus a lot of my reading around series. I was somewhat successful with this, although I only read two series to completion. Of the 44 texts I read in 2022, 23 of them were part of a larger series.

One of the subplots in the text deals with the narrator’s 18-year-old self, and he and his friends are dumb. And so was I. And so probably were you!The plot of this novel is made up of 3 coming of age tales. They take place in 1968 (in county in Vietnam), 1979, and 2016. In 1979 Vincent Bianco is a senior in high school and that summer he works with William, a young man who served in Vietnam in 1968. The third story line takes place in 2016 during Vincent’s son’s senior year of high school. They are slightly connected, and although different in specifics, they are alike in dealing with the universal aspects of one’s gaining maturity. This is a novel about going from boyhood to manhood, and what it means to be a man. This is something that the loud idiots in contemporary society mock, which tells you that it is something that its true and important to understand.There are moments where author Robert Dugoni borders on melodrama and is a little cheap in his devices (especially in chapter 24). Yet despite the moments where the writing is not stellar, I enjoyed this read. The text held my attention and I never dreaded picking it up. I also found myself equally interested in all three plot threads, which I think is an impressive feast for the author to pull off.Quotes:•	“A purpose, I have learned, is rarely found, but revealed.”•	“Dreams are hard to catch, aren’t they?”•	“…taught me that you can’t expect to be treated as a man if you act like a child.”•	“I was going to live forever. Aren’t we all at eighteen?”•	“I am like the pencil I constantly sharpen with a knife; I am just a dull nub of the person I was.”•	“The hardest thing to accept is that death is real.” •	“I looked at my friends and thought of all the dumbass things we’d done, and I wondered how long we could continue to get away with them without something bad happening.”•	“Maybe speaking the truth was contagious.”•	“Never get in a fight if your heart isn’t in it. You’ll lose.”•	“It was part of growing up. It was part of realizing you don’t know a damn thing about the world, that at times, you weren’t even playing the same game.”•	“Everyone’s past contains things we are not proud of, skeletons in our closet that we do not share, not with strangers and not with those we love and who love us.”•	“You can make your own luck by making smart decisions.”As mentioned, I enjoyed all three plot lines in this novel, but the journals from William’s time in Vietnam was a part that stuck with me. There is a section on the bottom of page 267 that made me stop and take pause. I won’t discuss it here, but the idea of evil within us, and how it affects every view we take in is an intriguing thought. There is a reason evil does stupid things. It’s because it is convinced of its invincibility. All in all, I found THE WORLD PLAYED CHESS to be honest in its sentiments, and I appreciated its embrace of things currently out of fashion: manhood, faith, service to country, the importance of family, etc. It was a worthwhile read, and I am glad I picked it up....more",Notes are private!,0,36,1,"Feb 06, 2023","Feb 14, 2023","Feb 06, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/56576967-the-world-played-chess

It also happens to be the first book in a series about an LA detective named Renée Ballard. Like any first book in a series the backstory is being established, and so you can tell the series and character is trying to gain its feet. It is a solid introduction and a promising start. The plot is simple, Renée Ballard is a detective working the night shift (the late show) in the Hollywood Division of the LAPD. She was placed there after sexual harassment charges on a superior officer were not backed up by her former partner. As a result of working nights, she rarely gets to follow up and take a case to completion. But one night, two cases fall into her lap, a shooting at a nightclub, and a prostitute is nearly beaten to death. She just can’t let them go.Renée is a smart and cagey women, and her backstory is revealed bit by bit to make her interesting. I can’t say that I found a lot of depth to her characterization, but enough to keep me reading. Connelly keeps the novel moving at a good clip and I was never bored while reading it. In the detective story/crime genre is there anything else really needed?Quotes:•	“If you go into the darkness, the darkness goes into you. You then have to decide what to do with it. How to keep yourself safe from it. How to keep it from hollowing you out.”•	“She could not articulate it even to herself, but going through it again in her head and not second-guessing anything was therapeutic.”Folks have been telling me for years to read Michael Connelly.

I was fine with it and it’s not that long, so I enjoyed the read.The first half of the book is dedicated to the creation and training of the 10th Mountain Division in the early days of WW II. It is mostly interesting, and a lot of the training took place at Camp Hale, which was in an area of Colorado where I have family, so I was familiar with many of the mountains and locales mentioned.The 10th Division did not go to Europe until December of 1944, so the part of the text where they were actively engaged is not that long. However, the author makes it quite clear that it is not the amount of time spent in a war zone that matters, but the intensity of the events while there. The 10th may have only seen four months of action, but Italy was intense in those four months. Consider this excerpt- “Just 4 months and one week separated the arrival of the first regiment of the 10th in Naples on Christmas Eve from the moment when the Germans surrendered the day after May Day. “Our stint in combat was short,” William Lowell Putnam would write, “though frightening severe.” In terms of the percentage killed per day in combat, the 10th suffered the highest casualty rate of any US division in the Italian campaign.”The author, Maurice Isserman, uses a lot of primary sources and personal stores in this text. A nice touch is that a lot of the soldiers he pulls out for mention, we also get to know what happened to them. He keeps us informed of their deaths, or postwar activities if they survived. It gives the reader a feeling of completeness that I appreciated.Quotes:•	“The best way of avenging thyself, Marcus Aurelius argued, is to not become like the wrong-doer.”•	“Trauma, guilt, and regret were also among the souvenirs packed home by the veterans in 1945.”I’m sure there are more engaging books on the 10th Mountain Division, but Mr. Isserman writes with a respect and reverence, and an obvious love for history that it blots out any of the text’s flaws. I close with one of the final thoughts of the book. “The views from Riva Ridge and Mount Belvedere (battlefields of the 10th) today are of a beautiful and peaceable landscape in an imperfect, but better world.”...more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,"Jan 23, 2023","Feb 05, 2023","Jan 23, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43261180-the-winter-army

The two books read back to back form one story. They can each be read as stand-alone texts, especially THE BLACK WIDOW, but I don’t recommend doing that. HOUSE OF SPIES is not as tightly written as its immediate predecessor, but it is still a darn nice read.Mr. Silva has made Gabriel the Director of Israeli intelligence at this point in the series, so it gets a little eye rolling when Gabriel is out in the active field. That would never happen in the real world, but this isn’t the real world, so you go with it.The best thing about this text is that a lot of it focuses on the character of Christopher Keller, who as the series has progressed has taken an interesting character arc, and assumed a larger role.

It served as the basis for GOD BLESS YOU, DR. KEVORKIAN. In this text Vonnegut creates a scenario where Dr. Kevorkian creates near death experiences for Vonnegut which gives him the chance to interview deceased folks (real life folks, not characters, with the exception of his go to alter ego - Kilgore Trout) in the blue tunnel that leads to the Pearly Gates. Some of the “interviews” are with people everyone has heard of: Shakespeare, Newton, Hitler. Some with folks that most of us have never heard of. Most of the folks were decent human beings, some were not. Interesting concept.Like much of Vonnegut’s late work, the quality varies, but in this slim volume the read is an enjoyable afternoon, and one I recommend for those who love Vonnegut.Two moments that have stuck with me:1.	I loved Vonnegut’s explanation of where angels come from. I won’t spoil it, but it made me misty eyed.2.	While interviewing an amateur horticulturalist Vonnegut reveals that the man’s first act in Heaven was to pick a flower he had never seen before. I loved that!Quotes:•	“I wish one and all long and happy lives, no matter what may become of them afterward.”•	“Like Roman games, justice systems are ways for unjust governments- and there is no other sort of government- to be enormously entertaining with real lives at stake.”I enjoyed this quick collection. Most pieces are only a page or two. There are many nice moments, with that Vonnegut voice and dry wit and humor on full display. Occasionally, the bitterness that was to engulf Vonnegut’s later years raises its head for an instant. But in the main, Vonnegut’s idea of an afterlife-no Hell, a Heaven that seems to be a place where all people wind up with no regard to any religious connection - makes for a lighthearted, yet still thoughtful look at what the other side could be, at least in Vonnegut’s wishful imagination.If you have read a lot of Vonnegut then you should pick up GOD BLESS YOU, DR.

RHINO RANCH was published in 2009. The character of Duane Moore stuck with the author for a while. He is sticking with me as well.This text is much better than its immediate predecessor in the series and takes the reader up through the end of Duane’s life. Like most death in McMurtry, it comes when it comes, it is not made a big deal of, it just happens. That is one of my favorite things about this author, he does not romanticize the normal. Life is life and it happens in the main without fanfare.In RHINO RANCH Duane returns to Thalia, Texas after a failed marriage to a much younger woman, and he learns how to be retired and old in the place of his birth. A billionairess has also opened a preserve in town to protect the endangered black rhino. This introduces some new characters and a new element to Thalia, Texas in the series' final installment.Here are a couple of moments that stood out to me:1. There is a poignant instance where some characters realize that they change, physically, as they age. The power is in McMurtry’s concise yet truthful depiction of the moment of realization of this common knowledge that no one really believes until it happens to them. 2. At one point a character comments that happiness is a “temporary condition”. We don’t want to admit that this is true, but it is true. I love that McMurtry’s people accept this as part of life, and deal with it. They don’t wallow in it, they don’t feel sorry about it. It just is.Quotes:•	“Maybe it was just that as the funeral bell came closer to tolling for him he felt a tendency to linger in what had been, or maybe still was, home.”•	“Feeling sorry for yourself is a bad habit. Just hush!”•	“Old people get less and less the same, all the time.”•	“What kind of silly damn university, that they don’t teach Mike Hammer or Louis L”Amour?”•	“You’ve lost your sense of purpose. That happens to most of us at some point or another.”•	“They had been too far apart, for too long-so long that they had become abstractions to one another.”•	“…but we’re both old enough to need a little quiet companionship now and then.”•	“To forgive is to survive.”•	“Small-town people almost never mind their own business. Gossip is one of the things that keeps them alive, I guess.”It feels very bittersweet to come to the end of the saga/life of Duane Moore. I mostly enjoyed the journey. It was nothing magical. No amazing feats, no exceptional life choices. Just a man. Living, loving, working. Sometimes happy, sometimes not. Occasionally depressed, sometimes surprised by joy. But always human.Farewell Duane. Farewell Thalia, Texas.

The protagonist, English professor Cameron Winter, is a lonely man. If there’s a pervasive feeling in this text, it is that feeling, loneliness. The book features a decent mystery plotline, but really at its core it is about the foundation that family provides for society. I love that message! Because it is the antidote to loneliness!The plot is that Professor Winter receives a call from an ex who is representing a man who has admitted to the brutal murder of his girlfriend in a small town. The defendant is an ex-army ranger, and the town of Sweet Haven is chock full of ex-military. Something is amiss. Everyone in this book, including Professor Winter, is more than they first appear.Author Andrew Klavan has written a very tight book. He gets to the point, but it never feels like he left anything out. This despite the fact that there are gaps. Especially in what the reader is told about our protagonists’ background.Quotes:•	“My body does what bodies do, but the soul has gone out of it.”•	“For a moment all the memories between them-all the things they weren’t saying to each other- were silently said.”•	“Before you lose things, you don’t really know you can lose them.”•	“A man, a woman, and a child. It’s such an elemental thing.”Coming in at 250 pages, this is not a long book, but in its pages Klavan makes it clear that he values traditions, appreciating the sentimental, and rejecting the ugly, negative bitterness that popular culture tries to normalize today.

I struggled to be engaged in this one, and that has not happened before in this series. This novel is under 200 pages, but it felt long.In WHEN THE LIGHT GOES McMurtry takes some threads he started in this book’s predecessor (DUANE’S DEPRESSED) and does not seem to know what to do with them. So why did he decide to pick them up? I would love to know if he meant this book to be the final about Duane Moore, or if he knew he would be writing another. This text is also vulgar. Pointlessly so. McMurtry can be rather candid when it comes to sex, but the detailed descriptions in this one left me scratching my head.Quotes:•	“What it meant, he supposed, was that he had been so alone and sexless so long that he had forgotten the language of women…”•	“If you have real connections to your family, your friends, and your lovers, then your life is never more than partly your own.”•	“The moral, if there was a moral, was that no one place was sufficient for all the stages of his life.”•	“I sometimes think the sexual organs were put there to keep the human race humble.”I have been with Duane Moore for 4 books now, and I am going to view this text as a moment in life that one would rather forget. We all have periods like that, I guess a fictional life is allowed to have those as well. It is not a bad book, just one that does not fill out (or enhance) a life.

A book a“I will forget today, but that doesn’t mean that today didn’t matter.”STILL ALICE was a book club selection, or I doubt I would have read it. A book about a college professor who develops early onset Alzheimer’s. Fun! But, I am glad I have read this novel. It has stuck with me, and that says something.The author, Lisa Genova, has a PhD in neuroscience, so in my eyes that gave the novel a little more weight in its authenticity. I know nothing about the brain, so I could be way off in that assessment. In short, Alice Howland is a well-respected psychology professor at Harvard. The reader follows her story from beginning of symptoms to well into dementia. The novel is told from Alice’s perspective. To be trapped in the mind of someone with developing Alzheimer’s and worse and worse cognition is terrifying. A brilliant choice by the author, and one that at many times unnerved me.There are moments where the writing is not as good as the idea it is trying to convey. I forgave it, because STILL ALICE was originally self-published, and also a first novel. Some things that have stuck with me-A gut punch for me was a moment where Alice learns that genetic markers indicate her children have a 50% chance of carrying the mutation, and that if they do carry it they will 100% develop early onset Alzheimer’s. What a horrifying thing as a parent to have to process.I was also depressed to learn that eventually the use of words and language is taken away from those with Alzheimer’s. I thought they could still at least read, even if they forget it. Nope. Losing the ability to read…the thought destroys me.The ending of this book is powerful. Maybe even perfect for this kind of story. Wow. Just wow!Quotes:•	“She thought about the books she’d always wanted to read, the ones adorning the top self in her bedroom, the ones she figured she’d have time for later.”•	“Everything she did and loved, everything she was, required language.”•	“But they were a family, yoked by history and DNA and love.”•	“What if she didn’t have time to read everything she’d wanted to?”•	“I know what I’m looking for, my brain just can’t get to it.”•	“But her thoughts from idea to mouth moved too slowly today, as if they had to swim miles through black river sludge before surfacing to be heard, and most of them drowned somewhere along the way.”•	“I’m so afraid of looking at you and not knowing who you are.”•	“Prioritizing hurt, a reminder that the clock was ticking, that some things would be left undone.”STILL ALICE is worth reading if for no other reason than that it creates empathy. Which is what all good fiction should do. The reader is terrified, and torn up as we experience from Alice’s point of view what is in her mind verses what she is able to communicate.

This is supposedly one of Shakespeare's ""problem plays"", but I don't see the problem. We have characters who have extreme emotions (a favorite Shakespeare motif) and some situations that border on ridiculous, but the emotion and heart of the conflict reflects reality in a way that only Shakespeare can produce.Plot, in short-Helena loves Bertram, a man who is her social superior. He spurns her. She later uses medical skills learned from her deceased father to heal the ailing king, who promises her anything for her service. She wants Bertram, he is forced to marry her, and then flees to war. She follows, and tricks him into recognizing her worth. Although modern audiences may balk at Helena's throwing herself at a man who disdains her, we must remember that Helena is in love, and thus, not always rational. Love wants its desires, not practical realities. Some highlights:ALL’S WELL includes a wonderful Shakespearian character in Parolles. The man is a coward, a fool, and a braggart. The irony (and joy) of his character is that he knows and accepts these faults in himself. Despite his poor qualities, he is really the most honest character in this work. Read this play if for no other reason than to introduce yourself to this this great character. Act 1:3 is a delight to read. Witty comic dialogue, and some beautiful language, especially as it relates to love is to be found there.I love the character of the Countess of Rossillion, the mother of Bertram. She is probably the best older woman’s part that Shakespeare wrote. Quotes:•	“Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie, which we ascribe to heaven.”•	“I am driven on by the flash, and he must needs go that the devil drives.”•	“It is the show and seal of nature’s truth, where love’s strong passion is impressed in youth.”•	“Honors thrive, when rather from our acts we them derive than our foregoers.”•	“The devil it is that’s thy master.”•	“Methink’st thou art a general offence, and every man should beat thee.”•	The soul of this man is his clothes. Trust him not in matter of heavy consequence.”•	“I find my tongue is too foolhardy.”•	“Simply the thing I am shall make me live.”•	“Praising what is lost makes the remembrance dear.”Existential questions about self-worth and the paradoxical nature of humanity are the real crux of this play, and once again, Shakespeare shows us what it means to be human. As one character says in Act IV, ""The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and ill together…” ALL’S WELL THAT ENDS WELL demonstrates this in the dual nature of almost every character and plot device.The new RSC Modern Library editions of the plays of Shakespeare are a quality trade paperback edition of the works of the Bard.

The colonial forces in Nigeria get wind of it, and attempt to stop it.I feel this piece is metaphysical, maybe a bit political. It definitely deals with the idea of the traditional, and its power.

The first two acts of the play are generally considered to have been written by George Wilkins, and one can clearly see Shakespeare’s pen at work in the last three acts. And the play works. It is enjoyable to read (again, especially the last 3 acts) and fun to watch performed.I gave PERICLES a 3.5 star rating compared to other Shakespeare, not to literature as a whole. The Bard is in a class of his own.The text boasts many interesting supporting characters, but one of my favorites is Dionyza, the prototypical jealous evil queen/stepmother out of fairytales. Her silky fake sweetness is a delight to read. In a play full of intriguing supporting players, she stands out.Like most of Shakespeare, PERICLES has some moments that seem especially relevant to our times. In Act 4:2 pimps in a brothel discuss their female acquisitions and the scene is one of the most disturbing in Shakespeare. Considering the modern sex trade, it is eerily present day. It is skin crawling, and Shakespeare spares no subtly while having the characters detail their view of females and the commodity of sex. His making one of the pimps a female ups the queasiness in the scene even more.Contrasting this is Act 5, which is one of the most tender in all the Bard’s output. I would say it is almost perfect. His last plays had a resounding sentimentality much greater than his earlier work. Personally, I like those moments very much. They are full of grace. I love that.Quotes:•	“I thank thee, who hath taught my frail mortality to know itself.”•	“Few love to hear the sins they love to act.”•	“One sorrow never comes but brings an heir, that may succeed as his inheritor.”•	“One sin, I know, another doth provoke: murder’s as near to lust as flame to smoke.”•	“We do not look for reverence but for love…”•	“Wind, rain, and thunder, remember earthly man is but a substance that must yield to you.”•	“How well this honest mirth becomes their labor.”•	“Opinion’s but a fool that makes us scan the outward habit for the inward man.”•	“Virtue and cunning were endowments greater than nobleness and riches.”•	“Pray, but be not tedious, for the gods are quick of ear.”•	“No visor doth become black villainy so well as soft and tender flattery.”•	“Thou art a piece of virtue.”PERICLES is an epic adventure, spread out over 14 years, ending with grace, reunification and redemption which makes for a very satisfying conclusion. It is a very pleasing read.The RSC Modern Library editions of the plays of Shakespeare are a quality trade paperback edition of the works of the Bard.

Traveling incognito (somewhat) through Europe was an amazingly astute thing for a young monarch to do. Peter’s travels to Western Europe were key to bringing Russia into the modern age. Compared to other nations in the late 1600s, Russia was positively medieval before Peter dragged it kicking and screaming into the modern era.Often while reading this book I would find myself getting irritated at Peter’s barbarity, and he could be a tyrant. But then Massie would bring up some of Peter’s more enlightened attitudes. Peter was an autocrat, but he was also lenient about religious practices that did not follow his own, he banned the killing of children who were born deformed (a common practice in Russia at the time), he banned women being forced into compulsory marriage, he worked to bring the rights of Russian women up to the western standards of that age, and many others. Peter, like all of us, was a man of contradictions.Quotes:•	“The most accurate image of Peter the Great is of a man who throughout his life was perpetually curious, perpetually restless, perpetually in movement.”•	“Peter viewed himself as personally responsible for the strengthening of the national economy, but at the same time he understood that private enterprise and initiative were the true sources of national wealth.”Direct quotes of Peter’s:•	“We shall exercise no compulsion over the consciences of men, and shall gladly allow every Christian to care for his own salvation…”•	“Less servility, more zeal in service and more loyalty to me and to the state-this is the respect which should be paid to the tsar.”•	“When the light of learning is lacking, it is impossible that the church should be well run.”This is a long book, and just when I was getting a little sick of Peter, Massie would frequently insert a chapter that focused on the larger historical framework, so that when he would later write something more specific to Peter/Russia the reader had a sense of the larger context of the action. It is effective, broadened the scope of this book, and made for a delightful reading experience.Massie has a few other books about Russian monarchs/history.

I did not have particularly strong feelings for that book. I read it, it was okay, moving on. I had exactly the same experience with this text (Although I think THE ALIENIST is a better book). I was not bored by it, it held my attention, I never dreaded picking it up, yet when I was done with it I was glad to be moving on.The main problem with this book is that it has too many words. Coming in at 629 pages, I don’t feel the story warranted the length. Yet, I think all the words are why those who love this writer are his fans.This text features cameo appearances by historical figures Clarence Darrow, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Teddy Roosevelt. They are plopped in to help create the period authenticity (the novel is set in 1897). It is a nice touch, it works. As in this novel’s predecessor, a great strength of the text is its sense of period and place. There is also a lot of foreshadowing in this book. It gets a little heavy handed from time to time, but for the most part it is deftly employed. And in a book of 600 plus pages, you need a little foreshadowing!Quotes:•	“…there’s plenty of stories that need telling what never get told, just because people can’t bear the listening.”•	“There’s times when those of us born with what you might call wise mouths just can’t control them.”•	“But hoping was a step up from worrying.”•	“But then, one can be as foolish unconsciously as consciously, eh?”•	“If things go on like this, we’ll find ourselves in some shadow world, where lawyers use the ignorance of the average citizen to manipulate justice the way priests did in the Middle Ages.”•	“…the kind of healing magic that only children can bring.”•	“I think a baby’s hand is the most beautiful thing in the world.”•	“But it never stopped him from working, from pressing ahead, and it’s that ability-to work through the self-doubts what any worthwhile human being feels- that is, so far as I can tell, the only thing what separates a meaningful life from a useless one.”Looking at some of the above quotes, I think they demonstrate my main quibble with this text…the noneconomic use of words.All in all, THE ANGEL OF DARKNESS is a decent book in the gothic thriller tradition. I liked it, but as it is not better than the first book in the series, if there is a third I don’t see myself reading it....more",Notes are private!,0,38,1,"Sep 05, 2022","Sep 19, 2022","Sep 05, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/39025539-the-angel-of-darkness

Storms in NO SUNSCREEN FOR THE DEAD, the 22nd novel in the series. In this go round Serge becomes obsessed with retirees and the retiree lifestyle. It is a fun romp and leads to some satisfying moments where Serge pays retribution on those who take advantage of the elderly.An interesting theme with this book was how patriotic it is. Elements of the Cold War, retired spies, Russia’s attempts at a resurgence in geopolitical relevance, all combine nicely to remind the reader that even in America’s darkest days, most of its people are still pretty decent individuals. Chapter two in this novel is brilliant. Mr. Dorsey satirizes the invasion (and loss) of privacy, and how the consumer carelessly turns it over to Big Tech all the time. It is biting, and scary, stuff.Quotes:•	“The key to life is realizing that all our years are golden, and the sooner you retire the better.”•	“Celery is like food, yet it isn’t. You think you’re eating, but something’s missing from the program.”•	“But instead of guns and goons, privacy was conquered by this: ‘Terms of Agreement’”.

If I was not already invested in this character and his life I think this book would have irritated me. For the first 100 pages I was not overly thrilled with it, but then (as often happens with McMurtry) things changed on a dime. I think that to read DUANE”S DEPRESSED out of sequence, or as a stand-alone would be a bad experience. Reading it after having read the first two books featuring Duane Moore gives it much more impact.The first 30 pages reminded me a lot of this novel’s predecessor, TEXASVILLE, as McMurtry dips us once again into the chaos that is the home life of Duane Moore. I laughed out loud several times during those initial pages. But the novel slowly shifts over the first 100 pages and at chapter 12 I feel we get the thematic core of the text. It reads like a modern, and more accessible, Thoreau. I found it interesting and a little unnerving. Much like Thoreau himself, if you take the time to think on his writings. I mean, what person of middle age when they read a line like this- “Without exactly knowing it he had reached a point in his life where he had to live differently if he was to live at all…”- does not stop in their tracks with at least a little pang of recognition?I had such an odd experience with this text. Once again with McMurtry I was stunned by how succinctly, and accurately, he depicts the capriciousness of life. It kicks the reader in the gut. There is a death in this book (that comes out of nowhere) that affected me like no death I’ve encountered in my recent fiction reading. I am still not sure why, or how it happened, but it did. I was shocked, and a little sad at something that was not at all real, yet so very true to life. Quotes:•	“The thought of his own ignorance made him feel a little guilty.”•	“Sex was one of those things that seemed to inhabit a no-man’s-land beyond explanation or excuse.”•	“He wanted to be out of town, beyond the ghosts that lived in his memory.”•	“Love’s mostly suffering anyway.”•	“They were all doing more or less exactly what they should be doing-wanting, living, getting, squeezing as much as possible out of their little moments…”•	“He had other things to do, though it would not have been easy for him to say what the other things were.”•	“…all he knew at the moment was that his desires lay somewhere in the spacious realm of unsatisfied curiosity.” •	“Some crazy people are perfectly happy being crazy.”•	“He did not want to be a tumbleweed, sent skittering in his mind by every sharp breeze that life blew up.”•	“Everybody loses something as they go along in life.”This novel is melancholy, yet not depressing. It is rather contemplative. And that can scare some readers who maybe don’t want to think a little bit about their own life. When Duane muses this sentiment, the reader sympathizes. “He realized that for the first time in his life he had too much time to think; of course he had wanted more time to think, but that was probably because he hadn’t realized how tricky thinking could be.” There were times that DUANE’S DEPRESSED just soared emotionally. It may not be for everyone, but there are moments of great depth and insight in this novel....more",Notes are private!,0,39,1,"Aug 25, 2022","Sep 03, 2022","Aug 25, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/54816.Duane_s_Depressed

If you read the three books as a set (I did over a period of a few months) it is a solid read and an enjoyable experience. The three books as a unit are stronger than they are as individual set pieces.IN THE HURRICANE’S EYE focuses a lot on the naval aspects of the final few years of the conflict. Philbrick makes it very plain that this aspect of the war was key in the results playing out as they did. There were many features of the war’s final years that I knew little or nothing about, and it was fun to learn about them and to see them receive attention in a book of popular history.Quotes (most of these are from primary sources, not Philbrick):•	“…that there never was a people who had more reason to acknowledge a divine interposition in their affairs than those of the United States.” (Washington)•	“Let it suffice for me to add that I am acting on the great scale, that temporary evils must be endured where there is no remedy at hand.” (Washington)•	“…one of those rare individuals with the capacity to rise above the emotions of the moment and, given time, recognize what really mattered.” (said about Washington)•	“…the freedom of speech may be taken away and dumb and silent we may be led, like sheep, to the slaughter.” (Washington)•	“The moderation and virtue of a single character has probably prevented this revolution from being closed as most others have been by a subversion of that liberty it was intended to establish.” (Jefferson)•	“We may find by our own unhappy experience that there is a natural and necessary progression, from the extreme of anarchy to the extreme of tyranny; and that arbitrary power is most easily established on the ruins of liberty abused.” (Washington)•	“A great mind knows how to make personal sacrifices to secure an important general good.” (Washington)IN THE HURRICANE’S EYE held my attention, and I learned quite a few things I was not aware of.

The set up is pure crime thriller, and the plot is contrived, but Don Winslow does a nice job of creating a plotline that interweaves the stories of this group of friends into one thru line.Despite its summer sun tone there are some very heavy topics covered (child sex trafficking). But with the sun and sweat in your eyes and the too expedient ending it comes across as a little less serious than the subject matter warrants. I am not sure how I feel about that.Quotes:•	“The ocean feels heavy, swollen, pregnant with promise.”•	“Boone believes that a wave is God’s tangible message that all great things in life are free.”•	“Your development isn’t just arrested, it’s been arrested, tried, and summarily executed.”•	“…time is money if you actually make money.

I don’t know the point of this book. Flat, underdeveloped, and yet it felt so long. The novel is also overpraised to a ridiculous degree. So many ers claimed it was satirical and/or very funny. Where may I ask?As I began the book, I was thinking I was reading a clever opening. Nothing speaks to the current culture and generation like the image of millennial apocalypse survivors having to Google everything from “building a fire” or “experiencing grief”, or that when they walk through a deserted Walmart that they stock up on iPods, exfoliating body wash, and tinted moisturizers. (I’m proud to say that I don’t know what that last item is!) I thought, ‘this is brutal satire’, but then I kept reading and the incessant focus on brands and products made it apparent that it was not satire at all. A millennial wrote this book, and that is not meant as a compliment. The text features detail after detail about consumer products. In fact, the narrator brings almost every thought and/or memory around to consumerism, and yet the author has the nerve to takes shots at capitalistic culture. Can’t help exposing what she is, while trying to pretend she is something she is not. The characters in this book (I should say character as the text’s narrator is the only character who has any dimension, and even then, not much) know about a lot of stuff, and yet they know nothing of value.The first 30 or so pages loosely held my attention, and then when I realized it was not going where it could have gone, the next 200 pages bored me to tears. I would read 10 pages and felt like I had read 60. The text features inexplicably mundane details. An example, the narrator tells us all the steps to resetting a password. What??? I will say however, that the last 4o pages are the least painful of the book, so it has that going for it.Quotes:•	“The future just wants more consumers.”•	“When other people are happy, I don’t have to worry about them.”•	“You’re brothers-think of everything you share!”•	“You have to keep moving.”•	“But any government that granted its people freedom of speech, freedom of protest, showed respect for its citizens.”•	“To despise someone is intimate by default.”•	“If the masks actually worked, don’t you think maybe there wouldn’t be an epidemic?”•	“In these sad, uncertain times, however, it is important to be with the people you love.”•	“No matter where you go, you can’t escape the realities of this world.”Before you give me grief, arguing that I missed the point that the author was trying to create a metaphor with a fever that essentially makes you a repetitive drone before you die, and that the difference between those fevered and those healthy is hard to distinguish…blah blah…I do get it.

The books supposedly have some autobiographical elements to them, and after reading the first book I can only cringe if that is indeed the case. In this first text Patrick Melrose is a little boy (5 or 6) and the novel mainly comes from the point of view of six adult characters who make up three couples spending a weekend together. Occasionally we get the child’s POV and it made me sad every time we do because we see how a child’s world is shaped by parental neglect. It was uncomfortable and heartbreaking.This text’s tone is merlot dry. The characters are detached from most every emotional response to a situation. It makes for interesting reading. It is a very “English” book, and the dialogue reminds me of reading Evelyn Waugh, except in this text the characters are far less likable than in Waugh’s novels.Moments of irony abound in NEVER MIND. Some moments were delicious, others too forlorn for words. An example of the latter, a woman writes a check to a favorite charity (“Save the Children”) in the presence of her own sexually abused offspring, oblivious to his needs all the while. Another cringe worthy moment of irony is when one character says, “Nothing that happens to you as a child really matters.” with the smug self-assurance that only the truly clueless can possess. When this moment occurs, the reader realizes that we are dealing mainly with fools in this book.Side note, Patrick’s father, a character named David Melrose, is one of the most disgusting men I have ever encountered in literature. I detested him. The fact that he came across as believable and even slightly sympathetic is a testament to St. Aubyn’s skill as a writer.Quotes:•	“He knew that she could not help him unravel the knot of inarticulacy that he carried inside him.”•	“It was never quite clear to Eleanor why the English thought it was so distinguished to have done nothing for a long time in the same place…”•	“Always think for yourself. Never let other people make important decisions for you.”•	“Wasn’t indifference more dignified?”•	“God, sometimes she was so cynical it was frightening.”•	“Why was the center of his desire always in a place he had just deserted?”•	“To break even the smallest rules by which others convinced themselves that they were behaving correctly gave him great pleasure.”•	“ ‘Nothing but the best, or go without’: that was the code he lived by, as long as the ‘go without’ didn’t actually happen.”•	“No pain is too small if it hurts, but any pain is too small if it is cherished.”•	“…in the end one must oppose cruelty, at the very least by refusing to take part in it.”The book’s final two paragraphs is one of the more interesting juxtaposing conclusions to a novel I have read in recent years. NEVER MIND is not a long book (that is to its benefit…much longer and it would have been too much) and it has given me no reason not to continue with the second book in the series soon....more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,"Jul 14, 2022","Jul 20, 2022","Jul 14, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13614391-never-mind

It gives the reader a very full view. Peters is great at characterization, but one reoccurring character in the book really stood out to me. Sergeant Blake of the 26th North Carolina regiment, a lapsed Quaker. Peters does a swell job of slowly revealing more and more about his character as the novel progresses. Blake’s musings and inner life is superbly rendered.In all honestly, I’m having a hard time writing this . I don’t know where to focus. So, I’ll just share with you some moments/insights I had while reading the text. 1.	July 2, 1863 is brilliantly depicted in a harrowing, tension filled manner. Mr. Peters captures the small nuances and ‘almost’ moments that peppered that day, on both sides. I knew the outcomes, but the writing is so good, that I forgot what I knew and was fully invested in the moments.2.	The text demonstrates the contradictions of war brilliantly. A solider experiences great horniness after a day of battle, surprised that physical desire replaces grief; a general lies dying, startled at the thoughts that crowd his final moments; a solider ponders Abraham, Isaac, and God while he wonders who redemption is really for. Truthful moments like these are all throughout the novel.3.	At the end of chapter 17 some characters have a conversation about their pasts, their current motives, and what it might mean. It is astoundingly great human and character writing.4.	There is a chilling depiction of a psychopath, an Irish solider in the Union Army named Gallagher. Getting the viewpoint of one of those sick men who enjoy death and destruction is unnerving.5.	The portrayal of Confederate general James Longstreet is well rendered. Longstreet’s reluctance to engage in the false bravado that permeated much of the southern leadership who would not contradict the views of Robert E. Lee is made more poignant with our foreknowledge that almost of all Longstreet’s assessments (which he knew would lead to unnecessary death) were correct.6.	There are many moments of dramatic irony that only the best historical fiction, where the reader has the advantage of foreknowledge of events, can provide.7.	The final day of the Battle of Gettysburg is horrifically rendered. As a reader you just want to get past it. It is unrelenting. I felt trapped and anxious.Quotes:•	“Blake knew jealously cheapened a man, and he fought it.”•	 “I’m not certain that they have given me command of an army, or of a political convention.”•	“The mind accepts terrible things, because such things are only to happen to other men.”•	“Men feared different things. But all men feared.”•	“How lives changed, as the fires of youth burned down.”•	“In war, thinking laid a fine foundation, but battle was captive to the foibles of man.”•	“There were times when men had to die, and he had to make them do it.”•	“Battle was a litany of mistakes.”•	“A page had turned in the heavens, but he could not read the script.”•	“But knowledge had no power to vanquish emotion.”•	“The day had engulfed them all in its awesome magnitude, and it was a blessing to bob up alive at the end of it.”•	“The angel had saved Abraham: the spared life of his son was incidental.”Ralph Peters has done an extraordinary thing with CAIN AT GETTYSBURG (the title alone is brilliant). He has written the best novel I have read (to date) on the American Civil War. He has written four other novels that take the war to its conclusion from Gettysburg, and I will be reading all of them!...more",Notes are private!,0,36,1,"Jul 05, 2022","Jul 12, 2022","Jul 05, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12160826-cain-at-gettysburg

Much more objective in it examination of its subjects. This text is a great overview of the Revolution in the “northern” sector of the war (NY, PA, VT, Maine, Canada, etc.) from about 1777 to 1780.First, the quibbles. There are many abrupt transitions of topic without any explanations. If someone did not have a basic familiarity with the subject matter I think it could confuse. Also, in this book Philbrick makes assumptions about people’s motives. He did it in BUNKER HILL as well. I guess it is hard not to. At least in this text he made an effort to base most assumptions on some evidence.Some highlights include many nice examinations of key moments in the Revolution that I knew only a little about: the Battle of Valcour Bay, the Siege of Fort Mifflin & Mud Island, the machinations of the so called “Conway Cabal”, and others. Many nuggets of interest here that often get overlooked with some of the war’s more “glamorous” moments. The author also does a nice job of humanizing Benedict Arnold and George Washington, the main people of focus in the text, and their good and bad traits are objectively (for the most part) examined. Also well rendered are the machinations and backstabbing of some generals and politicians angling for power and prestige. Even when the cause is just and proper, some humans (maybe most) can’t rise above our natures and stay focused on the more noble effort.Quotes:•	“A state of revolution is the most seducing on earth.”•	“You are fighting for what you can never obtain, and we are defending what we were never meant to part with.” (Thomas Paine in a letter to British General Howe)•	“If ever destruction was complete, it was here.”•	“We must not in so great a contest, expect to meet with nothing but sunshine.”•	“In the end it had all come down to money. Unwilling to pay the taxes demanded by Great Britain, the American people had fomented a revolution; unwilling to pay for an army, they were about to default on the promise they had made to themselves in the Declaration of Independence.”•	“…in the nation that was to emerge from this seemingly never-ending war, ordinary citizens would ultimately have, whether or not their betters chose to admit it, the last word.”•	“Since republics rely on the inherent virtue of the people, they are exceedingly fragile.”•	“Treason, along with suicide, is the most self-centered of acts.”I enjoyed VALIANT AMBITION. I think it is the best book I have read (to date) about Benedict Arnold and the causes and consequences of his treason in the larger context of the whole conflict. It is detailed without being bogged down, a history lesson without being dry, and most importantly, about people who are a mix of emotions and qualities. The power and lesson for the reader is in recognizing that we too share those mixed bag of qualities.

From its opening chapter to its tension filled ending (tension filled because it is about human relationships) CAREER OF EVIL is a darn good read. The text’s opening chapter is chilling. Robert Galbraith puts you in the head of a psychopath. It is unnerving and it hooks you.As has been the case for the whole series, the characters of Cormoran and Robin are the reasons to read these novels. I was more tension filled in the final chapter of this book (which deals with Cormoran and Robin’s personal relationship) than I was in the climatic chapter that concluded the mystery plot that is the book’s focus. This speaks highly to the reality of the characters that Galbraith has created with these two.There are many moments of introspection from various characters that display a keen understanding of human nature. It is one of the main reasons that this book stays interesting for the reader. Particularly resonating for me were moments where Cormoran Strike ruminates on the aftereffects of a long, complicated relationship.Some quotes:•	“He did not want his happy day spotted and stained by old memories, bad memories…”•	“He, who had once been one of her primary sources of comfort and support, had become merely another obstacle to be navigated.”•	“He possessed a finely honed sense for the strange and the wicked.”•	“…but his treacherous subconscious was not done with him yet.”•	“You could find beauty nearly anywhere if you stopped to look for it, but the battle to get through the days made it easy to forget that this totally cost-free luxury existed.”•	“…a lava slide of anger and resentment swept away rationality.”•	“…they had lived in a spider’s web of fault lines, held together by hope, pain, and delusion.”•	“As always, he found her better looking in the flesh than in the memory he had of her when not present.”In CAREER OF EVIL Galbraith does an excellent job of slowly doling out more details about his protagonists’ past.

It was much better than its immediate predecessor in the “Fool” series. This text is the third (to date) in the series that follows the adventures of Pocket, a professional jester, who Moore sticks into plot mashups of some of Shakespeare’s works.The set up for this book is that Pocket is set adrift by pirates (see end of THE SEPENT OF VENICE, this novel’s predecessor) and lands in the Athens of Shakespeare’s A MIDSUMMER NIGHT’S DREAM. This text maintains many of the characters from that play, but from there Mr. Moore creates new characterizations, backstory and motives, occasionally keeping a plot device from Shakespeare.Like some earlier Christopher Moore, it is the voice of certain characters that is the main appeal of the read. Especially enjoyable to me was his characterization of Cobweb, one of the fairies serving Titania in the forest surrounding Athens.Some quotes:•	“I am slain and I grieve for a barren, broken world deprived of my delight.”•	“Lay on, thou piss-haired spunk whistle.”•	“I am not afraid. It affords me some license.”•	“I am sad and my knob is huge.”•	“I heard her smile more than I could see it.”•	“The powerful hold nothing but contempt for those who toady to them, all but the toadies know this.”•	“…and he is a puff toad of great self-importance.”•	“You are a disaster, a calamity, and an abject failure all rolled into one.”Unfortunately a lot of the humor is repetitive, and the novel runs out of steam in the last 30 or so pages.

The hopes and prayers of liberty-loving people everywhere march with you.” (4.5 stars)I have only read two Alex Kershaw books to date, but he is quickly becoming one of my favorite people writing about WW II. I have more of his work already on my “to read” pile.THE FISRT WAVE is about D-Day, and most of the text focuses mainly on June 5th and 6th, 1944. The text flits between all aspects of the invasion-sea, air, and the 5 beaches where troops made landfall. As a result of this format it focuses on British, American, and Canadian forces, and specifically highlights individuals who fall into all of the aforementioned categories.I picked up this text on the 78th anniversary of the events it depicts, and it seemed appropriate.One of the great strengths of THE FIRST WAVE are the numerous moments of humanity that unexpectedly move the reader as you take this journey: General Eisenhower watching every plane carrying the 101st Airborne take off as the invasion starts, soldiers in a Horsa glider singing bar hall songs as they near France, a Canadian chaplain walking among the death and carnage of Juno Beach giving last rites to the dying, the jaws of defeat being forced shut by small pockets of men fighting inland at Omaha Beach, a kilted solider playing the bagpipes as British commandos land at Sword Beach…I could go on.Some quotes:•	“It was 12:15 A.M., June 6, 1944. The most important day of the twentieth century. The first Americans had arrived in France.”•	 “Against the longest odds, in the worst imaginable circumstances, their courage and initiative had made a critical difference when it mattered most.•	“…that pride and a sense of responsibility were what really allowed men to carry on, to function, to not give up.”•	“In grief there is not always good sense.”•	“I can remember trying to pray- to thank God for bringing me back alive- but instead, I put my head in my hands and wept.”I appreciate this book because it gives the personal account of D-Day, not the overarching historical overview. And as a result I see the people, not the “history”. Thus it is much more impactful.Some other standout moments in the text include a soldier’s description of artillery shelling. It is simultaneously terrifying and beautiful. A stunning piece of writing. Also powerful are the reflections of officer Ace Parker as the war ends. It is sobering, and decimates the reader. His honest account of a soldier’s war ending is a highlight of the text, for many reasons.The Epilogue, “In Memoriam”, is deeply moving. The generation this book depicts was my grandfather’s generation, and now they are gone. As I look around I have to ask, “When comes such another?”THE FIRST WAVE is a first rate book.

In the Forward the author insists he is mimicking the rom com movie genre with this book. The problem is is that as a writer he is not skilled enough to pull that off. What we get is clichéd, trite, and poorly written and developed.

This entry is fine, but I do hope the series gets better.The book’s subtitle, “A City, A Siege, A Revolution” is essentially the text’s focus, and I especially liked the very atmospheric and interesting insights about the city of Boston as an entity. I have not come across a lot of that in my reading about the buildup to the war. There are lots of interesting tidbits in this book that have been neglected by a lot of writers and I appreciated the human stories that Philbrick incorporated into this popular history. I also like the emphasis given to Dr. Joseph Warren, who because of his death at Bunker Hill is forgotten often.However, it is hard in my mind to single out any of the moments I reference above because they are overshadowed by the biggest negative of this text. Throughout the book Philbrick seems hell bent on insinuating sinister motives to the likes of Samuel Adams and others of the Patriot cause, while dismissing with the toss of a sentence things like the fact that the British regulars executed any prisoners they captured on the infamous retreat back to Boston on April 19, 1775. He compares apples and oranges and wants me not to notice. A constant irritation in the text are the cheap shots that the author feels he needs to take at the revolutionaries. Insulting their contradictions, undermining their motives. It’s smug. He does this consistently throughout the book. And yet, very rarely when he considers the British actions or motives does he try to undermine them. It’s a subtle, and dishonest method of trying to make one side look worse than the other.Quotes: (these are primary sources, items contained in the book, not written by Philbrick)•	“Keep up a brave heart! They have begun it-that either party can do; and we’ll end it-that only one can do.”•	“It is not easy for men, especially when interest and the gratification of appetite are considered, to know how far they may continue to tread in the path where there are no landmarks to direct them.”•	“…there is no people on earth so ambitious as the people of America.”It is unfortunate that this book is written with an implied (for no reason) bias. As mentioned earlier, there are some great elements to this text, but Philbrick makes a huge mistake in trying to negate the humanity and time period of his subjects by pointing out their flaws based on standards 250 years later. Bad historian, sir. With the Epilogue once again the author qualifies everything. He can’t seem to help himself. My hope for the next two books in the series is that we examine, celebrate when necessary, and judge these people based on the context of the times in which they lived.

Duane is a rich oilman, now facing bankruptcy. His good friend from his teenage years, Sonny Crawford (and a big part of TLPS) is relegated to a secondary role in this novel. Duane and Sonny, who were the closest of friends in TLPS are casual friends at this point, despite having lived in the same small town all of their lives. They have had no big rift, life just happened and caused the drifting apart. It really saddened me, and added to the melancholy that hangs over the entire novel.The text is funny. The situations and dialogue are crackling with humor. This novel is so ridiculous, so over the top in the situations that it presents the reader, that in anyone else’s hands it would have been a disaster. In Larry McMurtry’s hands it is merely perplexing. I’m not sure what exactly I feel about it. It’s not love, but it certainly is not hate.Some items worth mentioning:At one point a character says of Thalia, “We’re all crazy and life in this town is what’s done it.” The book seems intent on proving that statement true in spades. It makes for some enjoyable scenarios.The protagonist, Duane, has a dog named Shorty. He kinda ambles through the book and I just delighted in most every mention of him.There is an unexpected and touchingly apt analogy that appears later in the book when Duane looks on his life like an old sheet being torn up for rags. It’s a moment that will give the reader pause.Quotes:•	“Getting rich had been tiring, but nothing like as tiring as going broke.”•	“ ‘I was just laughing at nothing’, he said. ‘It’s either that or cry about everything, and I wasn’t in a crying mood.’ ""•	“There doesn’t have to be anything so good about somebody to make you jealous when you’re in high school.”•	“A young man is even more unreliable than a drunk.”•	“Sundown brought with it a quality of peace that belied almost everything that happened during the day.”•	“Most people are forgotten.”•	“I guess I’d just like to lead a sensible life.”•	“Everybody causes somebody trouble.”•	“I think my wits live somewhere else now.”•	“That’s my limitation, it don’t have to be yours.”•	“Despite all the problems, past, present and to come, he felt deeply happy to be where he was.”Notwithstanding the fact that I am not sure what the point of TEXASVILLE is (it feels a bit undefined), I did not mind the read at all.

I can’t remember who recommended I read his memoir, but I did. FISH OUT OF WATER A SEARCH FOR THE MEANING OF LIFE is an interesting introduction to the work of Metaxas, and I am glad I read it, as I think it may inform my reading of the biographies of others he has written.First off, be warned Metaxas uses elevated prose. At times it feels forced and pretentious, but the feeling comes and goes. The text feels like a read from another time. Most of the time the dated stylistic flourishes come across as authentic to the author’s patterns of speech, albeit at times it was irritating. Another quibble is that the first part of the text has a jarring lack of the use of transitions.Eric Metaxas is a first generation American, the son of immigrants, a father from Greece, and a mother from Germany. The text explains how his family came to the US, and Metaxas’ birth, and then follows his growing up, through college, and into his lost early years, culminating in a born again experience for the author.Some items from the text that I enjoyed include:The most succinct, and damning description of modern American Christianity as I have come across recently, “…like most “Christians” we had a loopy amalgam of half-beliefs, many of which contradicted the actual tenets of our claimed faith, and resulted in what is a typical American-style “tolerance”, in which one treads lightly on issues of faith and truth…”There is a short section called, “Because He’s Your Father” where Metaxas recalls a lesson his uncle taught him about respect for one’s parent. It is touching, and a lesson sorely needed today.Metaxas is often self-deprecating and his examination of the condescending (unintentional) views of liberal undergraduates about the world around them is spot on. The section that focuses on his college years makes an interesting observation about how societies mores change, and books like LOLITA that were adored once, fall out of fashion in a different age. The less arrogant among us realize that this pattern will always be repeated, and that you should not walk through life thinking your views and time of existence is the end of history or the pinnacle of human taste and achievement. What is in fashion or culturally acceptable will always change, mainly because culture is not Truth. Count on it! It is the art that matters, not what it depicts. I’ll stop there, I could go on for days…Metaxas is a big proponent of the idea of truth, and he has a nice section inspired by Solzhenitsyn’s Nobel Prize speech in which he said “One word of truth outweighs the world.” Thinking about the idea of truth, and that it does exists, and it can’t be stamped out may not be the current flavor, but it is true none the less.I enjoyed the author’s take on MFA degrees and how many of them are good for nothing other than becoming a teacher in an MFA program. Hey, I have an undergraduate degree in the humanities, I love them, but practical…they are not. I appreciate his bucking the brutal dictates of higher ed. Numerous times Metaxas brilliantly takes on the lack of diversity and opinion in what passes for higher education these days. Mixed in with all of this was his nostalgic look at his undergraduate years, his college graduation, and an examination of memory. It made me think of things I had not considered in a while.There is a section where he talks about personal will, versus God’s. Consider this thought, “But as C.S. Lewis said, there comes a time when if we don’t say to God, ‘Thy will be done,’ He says to us, in effect, ‘Okay, thy will be done. Have it your way.’ He turns us over to our own desires, whatever they are…” Metaxas then goes into how this played out in his life. It was the kind of honest thought that I appreciated.The author and I share the experience of having to humble ourselves and realize that despite all we knew, our intelligence, etc. we were missing something that people we looked down on had. They had a focus on something much more important, than he (or I) did. I loved this paragraph, which I found to be true on a personal level. “I came to see that a kind of secular filter has developed over the last fifty years or so, and the mass media have largely- sometimes scandalously- ignored some of the most amazing stories of our time, principally because they tend to be uncomfortable talking about anything touching on faith-sometimes because of an embarrassing ignorance of theological matters, and other times for fear of how it will be perceived by their preponderantly secular colleagues. But as a result, most Americans have missed some tremendously important things about the reality and role of faith in history and culture.” All I can say to that is yes!Some quotes I pulled out-•	“…my mother is German, and if she cannot get something clean, it’s likely God’s way of saying you should throw it out.”•	“…which like all things, if we look at them rightly and clearly, open up onto an impossibly deep truth, onto a vista that would lead us all the way to Heaven itself, if only we had the infinite courage required to look.”•	“…under the blue sky of what we didn’t know was our youth…”•	“So I understood I was not merely studying books, but was through them trying to touch the ideas in them-truth and goodness and beauty.”•	“It was exciting to be making these connections, to see that there seemed to be a deeper order to things, ancient and invisible, but discoverable, like the laws of physics.”•	“But how had we gotten to the point where truth was so malleable?”•	“It is hard to want to share something with people we love and be unable to do so.”•	“Is that what memory is, a kind of explosion inward unto eternity and transcendence?”•	“Nothing can hold us, because our minds were created to yearn toward the borders of our world, to yearn to return to that place where they were created, outside of time and space.”•	“It made me sad, but it was a weirdly satisfying sadness, as though that sadness were somehow getting me closer to the real happiness and truth of the universe.”•	“It was easy to see where our forebears had gone wrong, but would we do better?”•	“The journey with God is meant in some sense to be a communal one…”I freely admit that a large part of why I enjoyed this text is because I identified with so much of it. At one point, I winced, as what Metaxas was saying about himself could easily have applied to me at one time as well. “I had somehow forgotten whatever Christian faith I once had or thought I had, had drifted away from it by degrees, never noticing how far.” Ouch!FISH OUT OF WATER is not for everyone. But it was for me. I enjoyed the manner in which it was written, I enjoyed the story it told. I find comfort in knowing that there are people out there who have had similar experiences. It makes one feel less special, in a good way. One last thing.

I’m not sure I still do, weeks later.The plot is that Macon Leary (an author of guidebooks) is asked by his wife for a divorce in the text’s opening chapter. The Leary’s have recently suffered the loss of their only child. Macon is very habitual, and even a little odd in his quirks, and he likes his routines. And he meets someone who is totally irresponsible (a woman named Muriel) who pushes her way into his life. As I was reading THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST, I kept resisting it. Telling myself that it was not speaking to me like most of the Anne Tyler I have read does. Yet, I was enjoying the book, and the experience of it. But there was a key character (Muriel) who I just detested, and there were moments of such inaction (by the character’s choices) that I was frustrated. But was that frustration at the characters and plot devices, or at situations in my life that reflected what I was reading?Regardless, the last 50 pages had the hook firmly planted in my mouth. They rocked my world. At which point, I realized the hook had been firmly planted much earlier than that.Anne Tyler is one of the best at writing the complexities of being human in a manner that is unassuming and yet gets right to the truth of the matter. It can be unnerving, and very powerful. Ms. Tyler gets us, and sometimes she gets the things about us that we don’t want to know. Sometimes it stabs like a knife, sometimes it makes us chuckle, but always there is the recognition.Here are two instances from this text of both.When I read this bit, I was stopped cold. It hurt.- “…he began to believe that people could, in fact, be used up-could use each other up, could be no further help to each other and maybe even do harm to each other. He began to think that who you are when you’re with somebody may matter more than whether you love her.”This made me chuckle, one of the best and most truthful depictions of middle age I have read- “He realized how stiffly he walked after he had been sitting in one position too long; how he favored his back, always expecting it to go out on him again; how once was plenty whenever they made love.”Some quotes. (There were so many moments I really had to pare this list down.)•	“It’s time we started digging out! How long are we going to stay fixed here?”•	“He wondered if he’d ever return to his old, unbroken self.”•	“He kept very erect and dignified but inside, he knew, he was crumbling.”•	“I’m forty-two years old. I don’t have enough time left to waste it holing up in my shell.”•	“You’re not holding steady; you’re ossified.”•	“He felt there was something he needed to do, some kind of connection he wanted to make…”•	“It seemed she used words as a sort of background music.”•	“It was his vast, lonely distance from everyone who mattered.”•	“…marveled at how an empty space could be so full of a person.”•	“There were all those hours still to be survived.”•	“…but he was secretly longing to fall in love…”•	“I really hate a man with an obnoxious dog.”•	“…isn’t it amazing how two separate lives can link up together?”•	“Odd how clear it suddenly became, once a person had died, that the body was the very least of him.”•	“He felt content with everything exactly the way it was. He seemed to be suspended, his life on hold.”•	“I just don’t think that sex is important enough to ruin your life for.”•	“Some lived careful lives and some lived careless lives, and everything that happened could be explained by the difference between them.”•	“Do you mean to tell me you can just use a person up and then move on?”•	“After a certain age, it seems to me you can only chose what to lose.”•	“…Lord, just go back and erase all the untidy, unthinking things he’s been responsible for in his life.”•	“Oh, it was their immunity to time that made the dead so heartbreaking.”•	“The real adventure, he thought, is the flow of time; it’s as much adventure as anyone could wish.”Of special note, the last two paragraphs of the book are astounding. Just astounding.I liked THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST more after finishing it and reflecting on it than I did while reading it. It is an Anne Tyler novel I had to surrender to.

I read THE LONE RANGER AND TONTO FISTFIGHT IN HEAVEN at that time, mainly because of the influence of a good professor, and that awesome title! Revisiting it 20 plus years later this text resonates in a different way for me. There is much melancholy and sadness in this book, but despite that there beats beneath the surface of all of these stories a persistent embrace of life. The good and the bad are there, but these characters keep plugging away, day after day. Some of these people get the good more than others, some seem to inherit mostly the bad. But they all breathe in and out, and put one foot in front of the other.The text is a collection of 22 loosely connected short stories, all dealing with Native Americans in the Pacific Northwest. There are some reoccurring characters, one of the most prominent being a man named Victor. We get glimpses into Victor’s life at different stages throughout the text.Some highlights from the text include the titular story, which has depth, and is tightly written and flows very well. Another personal favorite in this collection is “A Good Story”, which I just enjoyed. Finally, the story “The Approximate Size of My Favorite Tumor” is a lovely piece about laughter, relationships, and death.Some quotes from the text:•	“Memories not destroyed, but forever changed and damaged.”•	“Don’t need to believe anything. It just is.”•	“Your past ain’t going to fall behind, and your future won’t get too far ahead.”•	“They fought each other with the kind of graceful anger that only love can create.”•	“Music had powerful medicine.”•	“What’s real? I ain’t interested in what’s real. I’m interested in how things should be.”•	“One of his dreams came true for just a second, just enough to make it real.”•	“It was cruel, but it was real.”•	“Books and beer are the best and worst defense.”•	“More and more, he heard his spine playing stickgame through his skin, singing old dusty words, the words of all his years.”•	“Imagination is the only weapon on the reservation.”•	“Humor was an antiseptic that cleaned the deepest of personal wounds.”•	“I knew there were plenty of places I wanted to be, but none where I was supposed to be.”•	“But those arguments were just as damaging as a fist.”•	“How do you talk to the real person whose ghost has haunted you?”•	“Diabetes is just like a lover, hurting you from the inside.”As a rule I am not a fan of the genre of short story. Many times the limitations of the genre prove to be too much for me. However, Sherman Alexie makes me forget that I feel that way.

The book is an analysis of death as it is presented in Shakespeare’s plays. The text examines most of the portrayals of death and dying in the Bard’s works, and frankly it is an aspect of the plays that I had not given much consideration to before.Author Kathryn Harkup has a science background, and it was really interesting to interact with Shakespeare through that lens. She presents quite a few complex scientific analyses in a very accessible manner. The text is filled with really interesting bits, here is just a sampling-Harkup writes that “Shakespeare went further than all his contemporaries in his portrayal of medicine and use of medical terms in his plays.” She then backs this up by examining the plays and then examining Elizabethan medicine and types of medical practice. I loved it.A very cool tidbit was the section on the “English Sweating Sickness”. It is just intriguing, nothing else to say about it.There is a brilliant chapter that focuses on sickness. The author makes so many awesome connections to Shakespeare’s works. She gives examinations of certain lines of text that make brilliant sense in the context of illness in which Harkup is examining them.Ms. Harkup does an excellent job comparing medical/bodily knowledge in Shakespeare’s time to our own, and how that colors the line readings. For instance, when Lady Macbeth wonders that the murdered Duncan bleeds so profusely (“Who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him”) it is probably motivated by the Elizabethan belief that the body dried out as it aged. I love moments like that, and this book has many such!Some interesting lines from the text:•	“Death is a process, not a single event and, depending on the circumstances, the process can take a relatively long time.”•	“Despite death being a universal experience, with millions of witnessed examples and centuries of scientific study, it is surprisingly difficult to define exactly what it is.”•	“Death may be due to a variety of diseases and disorders, but in every case the underlying physiological cause is a breakdown in the body’s oxygen cycle.”•	“When new diseases are introduced into a population they are initially more virulent as there is no previous immunity to defend against them. The symptoms in these initial infections are more exaggerated and can even differ markedly from the symptoms displayed by patients once the disease has become established in a population.”•	“The playwright’s incredible insights into the bleakest human experiences are unnervingly accurate.”I enjoyed approaching Shakespeare through the eyes of a trained chemist, who focused on the scientific and medical aspects of death. It illuminated some Shakespeare for me in a new way. Harkup makes some astute observations about Shakespeare’s work, and she does it succinctly. As we know many of Shakespeare’s ideas and stories were not original, but his versions matter more because as Harkup says, “It is a much more complex depiction of human behavior and motivations than the original story.”Ms. Harkup gets it, and her book DEATH BY SHAKESPEARE, SNAKEBITES, STABBINGS AND BROKEN HEARTS will hep you to get his work in a fuller way.

I enjoyed reading US AGAINST YOU immediately after BEARTOWN. It makes for a long immersive story and I liked being in that world for a few weeks. This novel picks up about three weeks after the end of the previous text.Unfortunately, as a whole, I did not love US AGAINST YOU. I liked the book, but it is cheaply manipulative, and I can’t stand when authors do that badly. At times this novel borders on melodrama a little too much for my tastes.I’ll start with my dislikes and then hit the things I liked. In this text the character of Maya, a key figure in its forerunner, annoyed me greatly. Backman shares numerous songs that this teenager writes that in later years we know are huge hits (in the future Backman tells us she became a well-known singer/songwriter) and these songs are the worst sort of teenage maudlin screeds one assumes a child would write.However, the cheapest aspect of this text is that it seems like every person who lives in this town burst into tears, or at least gets misty eyed, all. the. time! It’s not true to life and is weak characterization.The ending is also too tidy by half. Backman can’t seem to help himself with tidy endings, and I think this one annoyed me because I dived right into it after finishing BEARTOWN and it was just too much. Maybe if I had some distance between Backman books it would have annoyed me less?One the positive side this novel sees the return of Benji Ovich who is a favorite character of mine from the previous text, and it seems the author likes him too. Benji defies stereotypes, which I enjoyed a lot.I really appreciate how hard Backman works to create no villains. He places no blame, and creates sympathy for characters who do awful things, because no person is all bad. I respect that. There were moments where characters I had come to loath over the course of the two books would have some aspect of their life revealed that would humanize them in a manner I could relate to, and I would be reminded that people are always more then what you know/assume about them.Another thing that was well done was the depiction of the subtle changes in a marriage that spell its doom. It was well rendered. It hurts the heart. It would have been very impactful if Backman could have stayed true to what he was depicting and actually portrayed its end…but tidy endings and all.Some quotes that I liked:•	“Sometimes good people do terrible things in the belief that they’re trying to protect what they love.”•	“Everyone is a hundred different things, but in other people’s eyes we usually get the chance to be only one of them.”•	“How much can you forgive your best friend for?”•	“When someone learns to be in the forest as a child, it’s like gaining an extra language.”•	“The best friends of our childhoods are the love of our lives, and they break our hearts in worse ways.”•	“She starts where she always does when it comes to survival: with humor.”•	“A long marriage consists of such small things that when they get lost we don’t even know where to start looking for them.”•	“But sometimes grief and rage can consume a grown man so completely that he doesn’t actually consider the fact that other people have feelings too.”•	“Even when it’s hard, even when you think it’s a nuisance, even when you’re scared. You always have to be a good friend.”•	“Father’s hopes can so easily suffocate their sons.”•	“The only thing you can rely on in all towns, big and small alike, is that there will be broken people.”•	“When the Devil gets old, he gets religious.”•	“Sons want their fathers’ attention until the precise moment when fathers want their sons’.”•	“…and loneliness drives everyone to make bad decisions.”•	“Our spontaneous reactions are rarely our proudest moments. It’s said that a person’s first thought is the most honest, but that often isn’t true. It’s often just the most stupid. Why else would we have afterthoughts?”•	“It causes a very particular sort of chill to have to see your best friend every day and know that they are no longer that.”•	“Feelings are complicated. Actions are simple.”•	“Lies are simple, truth is difficult.”I will add that I liked the addition of a couple of new characters that were not present in the book’s predecessor. I also greatly enjoyed getting fuller perspectives on some characters who I did not care for all that much in BEARTOWN. There is always more going on with people then what we know, and US AGAINST YOU reinforces that point.I understand there is a third book coming.

I was just not all that interested, and then after a 100 pages or so I had time to settle and start to like the book. With a large ensemble cast, and some interesting perspectives on humanity, once I got into it, I enjoyed the experience.The plot-a small rural town, Beartown, whose local hockey team is the biggest thing going. The team is on the verge of greatness, and then there is a rape. Things progress rapidly from there. BEARTOWN is told from the point-of-view of a third person omniscient narrator, so the reader is in the heads of most of the large cast of characters at some point. This novel is the story of a place. Some of the inhabitants of that place I loved, some I loathed…but for most of them I simply had moments of liking and disliking them. Because they are humans, and if I am honest that sometimes liking/sometimes disliking is how I feel about most people. The characters in this book are very human, and thus they are not all one thing or another, but an amalgamation of good and bad. Fredrik Backman does that very well in this novel, creating people who are a mix of contradictory characteristics. As a result, they are interesting.While reading this novel there would be a thought that would come out of the blue that would make me take pause. The following lines are one such instance… “A long marriage is complicated. So complicated, in fact, that most people in one sometimes ask themselves: ‘Am I still married because I am in love, or just because I can’t be bothered to let anyone else get to know me this well again?’” It is an uncomfortable thought, and in all honesty the truth is probably somewhere in the middle for most folks.Some quotes that I liked, for various reasons:•	“The town wakes early, like it does every day; small towns need a head start if they’re going to have any chance in the world.”•	“Never trust people who don’t have something in their lives that they love beyond all reason.”•	“He’s been old for a long time, but is really feeling it today.”•	“That’s both a big and a small thing. Knowing that there are people who will never abandon you.”•	“Religion is something between you and other people; it’s full of interpretations and theories and opinions. But faith…that’s between you and God.”•	“Loneliness is an invisible ailment.”•	“But isolating yourself happens faster than you might think…”•	“Humanity has many shortcomings, but none is stronger than pride.”•	“Everyone has a thousand wishes before a tragedy, but just one afterward.”•	“Words are not small things.”•	“Big secrets turn us into small men.”•	“There are damn few things in life that are harder than admitting to yourself that you’re a hypocrite.”•	“Sometimes life doesn’t let you choose your battles. Just the company you keep.”Mr. Backman likes tidy endings. This text is no exception. I did not mind it. In the end this is really just a novel about people, living their lives, reacting to the things around them.

I enjoyed the first part of the text, however, after Mr. Jost graduates from college this book took for me a decidedly dull turn.Especially bad is a long chapter where Jost (who writes for Saturday Night Live) gives his highlights of SNL sketches over the 15 plus years he has been there. It reinforced for me that I have missed nothing by not watching that show in over 20 years. I did laugh and laugh however when the author tried to sell me on the idea that he and SNL are nonpartisan. I could point out several instances in this very book where Jost contradicts that with his own words. Be partisan, what do I care? But don’t pretend you aren’t. That insults me.A couple of funny lines:•	“So it’s never a good sign when your German side is the less repressed one.”•	“I understand why some people want to punch me. I’m self-aware enough to realize what I look like.” I don’t regret reading A VERY PUNCHABLE FACE. It did not do much for me, but it was okay.

Brands. It won’t be my last.With THE MAN WHO SAVE“I hope to remain a solider as long as I live.” (4.5 stars)This is my first book from historian H.W. Brands. It won’t be my last.With THE MAN WHO SAVED THE UNION, ULYSSES GRANT IN WAR AND PEACE Mr. Brands has written a text that weaves a lot of primary sources in a coherent and thoughtful manner to create a fuller picture of a certain time and place. Especially striking in this book are several primary sources that detail the Battle of Gettysburg. And Grant had nothing to do with that battle, but the bit of text that focuses on this moment helps create that fuller picture I was alluding to.The structure of the text will focus on some aspect of Grant’s life, and then shift briefly to someone/thing else. It creates that fuller perspective, placing individual events/choices in a larger context. Although this book is about Grant, it is also an illuminating work on the period 1840-1890 in America.I had to chuckle when I read the following that General Sherman wrote in the 1860s, “There is a power in our land, irresponsible, corrupt and malicious, ‘the press’, which has created the intense feelings of hostility that have arrayed the two parts of our country against each other, which must be curbed and brought within the limits of reason and law before we can have peace in America.” I remember when the media hyperventilated when President Trump said some of them were the “enemy of the people” (they often are) and yet it seems that lying and agitation are just part of their long tradition. I love reading history and finding that my total disregard for the media is well founded in the past.Other points of interest included:Arguments about executive vs. legislative power. When one senator thunders that, “The President should obey and enforce the laws, leaving to the people the duty of correcting any errors committed by their representatives in Congress” one has to wonder if that question will ever be settled.The examination of Grant’s poorly worded Order #11 from his Civil War days is intriguing. Those ill formed words come back to haunt him when he runs for president. However, unlike nowadays, Grant’s sincere explanation of the mistake was enough for a public not looking to humiliate people for their past missteps.I loved Grant’s first inaugural address. He was a very good (and underestimated) writer. Lincoln’s influence is evident in these closing lines, “In conclusion I ask patient forbearance one toward another throughout the land, and a determined effort on the part of every citizen to do his share toward cementing a happy union; and I ask the prayers of the nation to Almighty God in behalf of this consummation.”The section of the text that focused on Grant’s post-presidential world travels is a highlight. He made several prescient predictions about international affairs, including a very accurate assessment of China’s future rise and ambitions. Pretty astounding considering he pegged in the 1880s, what folks were still dismissing in the early 2000s.Some quotes from the text:•	“…That things are seen plainer after the events have occurred.”•	“These terrible battles are very good things to read about for persons who lose no friends, but I am decidedly in favor of having as little of it as possible.”•	“Two commanders on the same field are always one too many.”•	“It is men who wait to be selected, and not those who seek, from whom we may always expect the most efficient service.”•	“I do not believe our Creator ever placed different races of men on this earth with the view of having the stronger exert all its energies in exterminating the weaker.”•	“He could reflect that his adult life had coincided with the Union’s long crises, and though he was not a boastful man, he took pride in his role-first as general, than as president-in bringing the Union through its crises intact.”I really enjoyed this book, and I think one of its main strengths is the fact that it has depth, without getting bogged down. That is a fine line to walk, and Mr. Brands navigates it astutely.I end this  with Brand’s succinct summation of its contents, “By the end of his public life the Union was more secure than at any previous time in the history of the nation. And no one had done more to produce that result than he.” With this book, Mr. Brand’s makes a very compelling case that President Grant did just that....more",Notes are private!,0,44,1,"Jan 29, 2022","Feb 16, 2022","Jan 29, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13531850-the-man-who-saved-the-union

The idea it tries to present does not sustain its length. I also found the characterization to be shallow, which is perplexing, and a bit irritating, again considering its length.This novel is motivated by an ambitious premise, but one that was not consistently well executed. I never once was not aware that I was reading a book while reading it. Everyone in it felt like a character, not a person, and so there was always an artificial feel to my experience.The plot follows three separate story lines that share a connection with an ancient Greek tale. One takes place at the time of the fall of Constantinople (my favorite of the three plot threads), one in modern Idaho (with flashbacks to the late twentieth century) and the final thread takes place in the future (the least interesting thread, for me).The modern Idaho story line contained my least favorite character, a kid named Seymour. I am not sure I agree with the author’s depiction of autism, and regardless I could not stand the character. I had an intense dislike for him.Some quotes that stood out for me:•	“A text-a book-is a resting place for the memories of people who have lived before. A way for the memory to stay fixed after the soul has traveled on.”•	“But books, like people, die.”•	“Each morning comes along and you assume it will be similar enough to the previous one-that you will be safe, that your family will be alive, that you will be together, that life will remain mostly as it was. Then a moment arrives and everything changes.”•	“The heart heals, but never completely.”•	“It’s not so much the contents of the song. It’s that the song was still being sung.”•	“Why can’t healing happen as quickly as wounding?”•	“Sometimes the things we think are lost are only hidden, waiting to be rediscovered.”I do not regret reading this book. Despite its length I read it quickly. There are moments throughout the text where I greatly enjoyed it. But my experience with it was too inconsistent for me to be captured by it. My reading of CLOUD CUCKOO LAND in summary:Beginning-I am surprised, and pleased that I like it…getting into it…irritated…hate it…liking it…irritated…the end.The idea this book tries to elucidate is a grand and worthy one.

Having recently been reminded by a book I picked up of how good a writer Kent Haruf was, I returned to it. Goodness, what does one say about a book like this? I adored it, I loved it, and I was entranced by it. What is it about? What the best books usually are always about…the day to day of living our lives. The point of view shifts with each chapter but focuses on only a few people. Young brothers Ike and Bobby, their father Tom Guthrie (a teacher going through a divorce), Victoria Roubideaux (a pregnant teenager), and the McPheron brothers (two old bachelor farmers). All living in and around Holt, Colorado in the early 1980s. PLAINSONG is such an unassuming, simple, and beautiful book. Kent Haruf has captured how loneliness (which is much more nuanced than the way it is normally portrayed) affects all of the book’s characters. It is not tragedy. It is life. I greatly appreciated his embrace of that aspect of the act of living into this text.A moment in the book depicts the autopsy of a horse. Haruf’s depiction of two young boys observing it, and fully realizing what death looks like is stunning in its simplicity. One sentence just shatters the reader in an unexpected way!Some quotes:•	“But I will not compete for you. I won’t get into some kind of contest for you.”•	“But the air was turning sharp, with a fall feeling of loneliness coming.”•	Question- “How you going to change now at this age of life?” Answer- “I can’t say, but I’m going to. That’s what I know.”•	“I wanted someone who wanted me for what I am. Not his own version of me.”•	“They’d arrived at this place one more time despite whatever good intentions they’d started with.”•	“It’s ridiculous to get so old, she said. It’s stupid and ridiculous.”•	“…and even what was no longer visible before them was still there in memory for recollection at night whether they wanted to recall any of it ever again.”•	“You don’t seem to ever get defeated or scared by life. You stay clear in yourself, no matter what.”I could not end this  without signaling out the McPheron brothers. I love Harold and Raymond McPheron. Present tense. The book may be done, but my emotions towards them are in the here and now. The parts of the novel that includes them just soars. I love the way they spoke-consider this conversation between the two of them.“You made it up, Harold said. He regarded his brother, who was staring out into the room. What else you going to make up? Whatever I have to.”I love the way they saw the world; I love their complete lack of guile; I love their simple decency; I love their contentment with circumstances.In short, I love everything about them.

A good version of the text, and one that is conducive to a read-thru experience. However, a quibble I have with the NIV is that it does not capitalize any reference to God/Jesus. I missed that because especially while reading the Old Testament it is helpful to signal to the reader passages that are making reference to the deity. I will do a straight read through of the Bible again, with a different translation. I found it to be a very worthwhile experience, as for the first time I felt I got the whole story.

He has a series of books about the Civil War, so I have decided to read them. DARKNESS AT CHANCELLORSVILLE makes me confident that I have made a good choice. The novel is structured so that we get many 3rd person points of view from various characters. Some of the perspectives are reoccurring throughout the whole text, and some only pop up once or a few times. I really enjoyed getting into one character’s head for a few pages, sometimes only for a few sentences, and then moving into another’s. Peters also does a nice job using the hubris of some characters to create some clever (and sometimes unexpected) moments of dramatic irony. The characters are complex. There is no hagiography here. Or scapegoating. These people are “good and ill combined”, as are we all.I have read quite a few novels about the Civil War, and Peters has them all beat for authenticity (the world leaps off the page) and for dialogue. His generals and soldiers are not the folks of pontificating history books. He also knows his stuff (Peters has an extensive military background, and is a very educated and obviously smart man). An example is in chapter 6 of the book, which is a brilliant depiction of Stonewall Jackson’s surprise flank attack at the battle of Chancellorsville. The often shifting perspectives in this chapter makes for a vivid recreation of what that evening must have felt like for the various participants.When an immigrant solider in the book said the following, I almost shouted. “But this war won’t be lost. It can’t be. We’ll win because we must win. Show me another country, anywhere, that has fought a civil war to free its own slaves-and men of a different race, at that. There is no such country. Only here.” I always remind people who knock America about the scourge of slavery about this very pertinent fact. It does not excuse it, etc. But it is relevant to the values and spirit upon which my nation was founded that slavery lasted less than 80 years in the United States. Compared too much of the world that is remarkable. It was lovely to see it echoed in this novel, and by an immigrant, a former soldier of the revolutions in Prussia. And, the sentiment was depicted in a manner still accurate for the prevailing sentiments of the period. Notice that this person (enlightened by the standards of the time) still sees color as a difference with an implication that it is somewhat less than. In the same vein, this is the first Civil War novel that I have read that gives a lot of attention to the recent immigrants (on both sides) who fought in the war. It gives a powerful depth this this text.Quotes:•	“He’d seen too many promising starts dissolve into chaos and loss.”•	“An officer with nothing to do was a danger to man and beast.”•	“Few things made Germans happier than melancholy music.”•	“Plenty of things that feel good don’t help.”•	“Habit outlasted reason.”•	“It was always the one thing you took for granted that bit you…”•	“He saw and sensed and knew things others didn’t, although he had learned not to speak of it to others.”•	“Equal in chances, if not in gifts.”•	“…the point is not to be damaged inside, even when we’re damaged on the outside…to believe not because, but despite.”•	“…but war didn’t whisper requests, it shouted demands.”Ralph Peters’ Author’s Note at the end of this novel is brilliant in and of itself. Don’t put the book down before reading it. At one point he writes, “I’m allergic to attempts to romanticize war.” This text proves that he truly believes that.From Generals Lee and Hooker to nameless privates on the field, DARKNESS AT CHANCELLORSVILLE bounces around, making a full picture for the reader. This is a realistic, gritty, and honest depiction of history.

The Hogarth project sees “Shakespeare’s works retold by bestselling novelists of today.” This text has Edward St. Aubyn take on KING LEAR. To recreate the power that Lear abdicates in the play, in this text St. Aubyn gives us Henry Dunbar, the head of a very powerful worldwide media conglomerate. It works. In fact, I give kudos to the author for doing a decent job of approximating certain characters and situations from the original play in this book. An example are Dunbar’s eldest daughters, (in this novel named Abby and Megan) who are appropriately vindictive and evil and they are good substitutes for Shakespeare’s detestable Goneril and Regan.One issue I had with the text is that the parts where Dunbar escapes from the hospital his daughters had consigned him to feels very repetitive. Every time the author tries to convey Dunbar’s tenuous grasp on sanity it felt like more of the same. I also found the writing to be a bit showy during these sections. The author trying to impress. It didn’t work for me. Another issue is that what seems appropriate and developed in Shakespeare seems rushed, clichéd, and underdeveloped here. I won’t go down that rabbit hole any further.Quotes:•	“There was nowhere, however lovely, that he couldn’t contaminate with his morbid thoughts and his perpetual fear.”•	“You can’t give something away and keep it at the same time.”•	“I try to kick the habit, but the habit kicks harder.”•	“Sentimentality offered her a holiday from the harshness of the rest of her personality.”•	“All the people he every hurt-a veritable crowd, it turned out-were turning their wounds into weapons.”•	“Love was all theater of course.”•	 “It was so unsophisticated to be shocked by things.”•	“Was this the triumph of self-knowledge: to suffer more lucidly?”St. Aubyn does a nice job of approximating the spirit of the final lines of KING LEAR. This is something I have not seen done successfully yet in this series. I did not love DUNBAR, but it did not annoy like most of the texts that I have read in the Hogarth Shakespeare.

The common welfare was my business; charity, mercy, forbearance, and benevolence, were all my business. The dealings of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business!”•	“…they were not forty children conducting themselves like one, but every child was conducting itself like forty.”•	“Now, being prepared for almost anything, he was not by any means prepared for nothing…”•	“He told me, coming home, that he hoped the people saw him in the church, because he was a cripple, and it might be pleasant to them to remember upon Christmas day who made lame beggars walk, and blind men see.”•	“But, they were happy, grateful, pleased with one another, and contented with the time…”•	“…hear me. I am not the man I was!”•	“I will honor Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year.”•	“Best and happiest of all, the Time before him was his own, to make amends in.”“A Christmas Carol” ends with a final chapter that is as joyful a reading as can be found in imaginative literature. I love this text!#1The essay “Christmas Festivities” is a lovely little piece about family holiday gatherings.Quotes:•	“Reflect upon your present blessings.”•	“A Christmas family party! We know nothing in nature more delightful.”#2“The Story of the Goblins who Stole a Sexton” is an okay story about a gravedigger who is visited by goblins on Christmas Eve. In all honesty I don’t remember much about it.Quotes:•	“But he was an altered man, and he could not bear the thought of returning to a place where his repentance would be scoffed at, and his reformation disbelieved.”#3“A Christmas Episode from Master Humphrey’s Clock” is a nice short story about two lonely people who meet on Christmas Day and become dear friends. I found it to be such a positive spin on the loneliness some folks endure during the holidays.Quotes:•	“Solitary men are accustomed, I suppose, unconsciously to look upon solitude as their own peculiar property.”•	“Meantime we have gone on strengthening in our friendship and regard, and forming an attachment which, I trust and believe, will only be interrupted by death, to be renewed in another existence.”#4“The Haunted Man”This novella has a powerful theme. Unfortunately it is incased in a work who execution from time to time I did not care for at all. This was the only piece in the collection that I wanted over and yet it kept going. It is also the longest piece in the collection. But then, there would pop up a moment like this that would make the slog worth it. Consider this moment-“ ‘May I tell you why it seems to me a good thing for us, to remember wrong that has been done to us?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘That we may forgive it.’ ”Hard to hate a work that emphasizes that theme.Quotes:•	“If I could forget my sorrow and wrong, I would.”•	“Think of your own remarkable mother boys…and know her value while she is still among you.”•	“Health will be more precious to you, after this illness, than it has ever been.”•	“There is hope for all who are softened and penitent.”•	“I thought there was no air about you; but there is and it’s the air of home, and that’s the purest and the best there is, and GOD bless home once more.”#5“A Christmas Tree”The oddest piece in the collection. Dickens starts it out as a remembrance of childhood toys, brought on by his staring at a Christmas tree. It then transitions into an examination of ghosts. I was a bit lost for a moment, but then he brings the two elements together in an interesting conclusion.Quotes:•	“I began to consider, what do we all remember best upon the branches of the Christmas Tree of our own young Christmas days, by which we climbed to real life.”•	“And I do come home at Christmas. We all do, or we all should.”•	“Ghosts have little originality, and ‘walk’ in a beaten track.”#6“What Christmas is as We Grow Older”A sentimental and melancholy essay that focuses on the memory of those we loved and have lost. It examines how the season brings them back to our hearts and minds.#7“The Seven Poor Travelers”A quick and simple conclusion to this text.Quotes:•	""...that Christmas comes but once a year,—which is unhappily too true, for when it begins to stay with us the whole year round we shall make this earth a very different place.”•	“Our whole life, Travellers,” said I, “is a story more or less intelligible,—¬generally less; but we shall read it by a clearer light when it is ended.”All in all, a good collection to read for the season. It will warm the heart, make the mind appreciative, and remind us to be thankful. I can’t complain about that at all.Thanks, Mr. Dickens for not letting the negative spirits of this world keep you from celebrating the good in mankind!...more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,"Dec 04, 2021","Dec 18, 2021","Dec 04, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/59701658-a-christmas-carol-and-other-christmas-writings

It reminded me a lot of THE HOUSE ON MANGO STREET, a book I read almost 25 years ago, but still remember. Featuring a large cast of colorful characters it is an episodic gathering of memories, and in very few lines Laferriere can create an entire picture.

I think if I had read the story contained in THE LAST PICTURE SHOW written by someone else that I would have hated it. But McMurtry writes people, with all their complications and foibles, so unassumingly that I buy in. Every time!Taking place in Thalia, Texas (the scene of two other excellent standalone novels in the “Thalia trilogy”) in the early 1950s, this novel, with its focus on teenagers as they leave high school behind is sensitive, harsh, disgusting, crude, and tenderhearted. All the things that teenagers can be, depending on the day.With its focus on Sonny and Duane, best friends, and the girl they both have feelings for (Jacy Farrow) the story is written in the 3rd person omniscient point of view and the point of view we are getting changes from section to section. This device is used effectively in this text, and besides the three main characters we jump into the heads of many secondary characters at key instances which greatly enhances the scope of the novel.There are lots of standout sections in the text, but here are a few…The poignancy of this moment gave me pause. A character says, “The reason I’m so crazy is because nobody cares anything about me. I don’t guess there’s anyone I care much about, either. It’s my own fault, though- I haven’t the guts to try and do anything about it.” The sadness and harsh personal realization in that statement are bold. Chapters 10 & 11 of this book are notable. Chapter 10 is harsh. What happens there is disgusting and awful and part of the petty cruelty of young people that is by and large unintentional. McMurtry just presents the action without commentary by any of the characters and it messes with the reader. You want someone to say, “This isn’t right”, but no one does. The author forces you to make that judgment yourself.Chapter 11 is a sensitive and absorbing portrait of a forbidden love affair. Because of the individuals involved I should have been horrified. I wasn’t.As a former English teacher I had to laugh long and hard when a character expresses dismay at a male English teacher in the local high school as “that’s a woman’s job.” And then I remembered I was the only male in the English department I use to work with. Ha!I had to grimace when one of the young protagonists expresses dismay at the end of a love affair. He muses, “It was very confusing to him because he had always thought you were supposed to get whoever you really loved.” Who hasn’t learned the truth of this? Only the very lucky, I imagine.As is usually the case with a Larry McMurtry novel, the characterization is spot on. There are some beautifully rendered secondary characters in this book that I adored. And there were some that I detested. I despised the characters of Coach Popper and Jacy Farrow. Hated them. Although I would be lying if I did not admit that McMurtry drew them in such a touching, nonjudgmental manner that I could still see and empathize with their humanity.There are lots of quotes I marked in the text. For the sake of brevity, here are just a few:•	“Once you got rich you’d have to spend all your time staying rich, and that’s hard thankless work.”•	“Something about it was good, even if much was bad.”•	“Loneliness is like ice. After you’ve been lonely long enough you don’t even realize you’re cold, but you are.”•	“I don’t want to be old. It don’t fit me!”•	“Romance might not last, but it was something while it did.”•	“…but some things had to be accepted if one was to become a woman of the world.”•	“Win a few, lose a few. That’s really the way it goes, all through life.”•	“He felt as though life was completely beyond him.”•	“He had just begun to realize how hard it was to get from day to day if one felt hopeless.”THE LAST PICTURE SHOW is another example of Larry McMurtry creating a text peopled with real folks, the good, the bad, and the ugly. And in his hands it feels like they are all supposed to be there.Goodness, do I love this writer!...more",Notes are private!,0,53,1,"Nov 22, 2021","Nov 27, 2021","Nov 22, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/317808.The_Last_Picture_Show

The gossipy (but eminently knowledgeable and talented) theater columnist for the New York Post, Riedel is the right guy to write this book. He is a talented writer and researcher and he has a seamless style that flows nicely. He can get a little into the weeds at times and you don’t mind, and sometimes don’t even notice, because his style and structure in this text work so well together.RAZZLE DAZZLE is really a cultural and historical study of how Broadway (as an institution) changed and grew from the fifties to the end of the twentieth century. It does not sound all that exciting, but in Riedel’s hands I was never bored while reading this text. Starting with the founding and history of the Shubert Organization, and culminating with the deaths of Bernard Jacobs and Gerald Schoenfeld (who saved the Shubert Organization and made it a powerhouse in the American theater) this book is a cultural history of the theater scene on Broadway, the transition of Times Square from porn city to a family destination, and the bankruptcy and resurgence of NYC. Along the way we occasionally get in-depth looks at iconic shows (“A Chorus Line”, Phantom of the Opera”, etc.) and personalities (Michael Bennett, Cameron Mackintosh, etc.) who changed the scene and the way business was done. It was surprisingly more interesting all the way through then I assumed it would be.Riedel sums up his book nicely when he writes, “…if it makes any impression at all I hope it’s that Broadway and its fractious band of colorful characters were as important to the survival of this city as any Wall Street titan, real estate magnate, civic leader, or politician.” It’s an interesting thought, and he makes a good argument for it.

The first paragraph sets the quasi noir tone of the book. What follows is a tight, well-constructed story. I was never bored while reading it, and I found this quick novel enjoyable. It has some of the quirkiness that those who have read Mr. Ames before have encountered, but not nearly as much as is usually present. And that as good thing. Mr. Ames is an odd dude, and sometime he writes odd things that I always thought distracted from the text. Not so much in A MAN NAMED DOLL.In short, the plot is about a private investigator, formerly of the LAPD, who is propelled on the journey this book chronicles when an old friend shows up on his porch with a bullet in his gut.A moment I have to comment on is an 8 ½ page chapter that Ames writes that gives a concise, yet complete, history of the 50 year old protagonist. And it does not appear until halfway through the novel. It is a bold and appropriate choice and it stood out to me as a really excellent example of the book’s construction.Some quotes that I enjoyed:•	“Like most people, he was a mix of things. Heroic and selfish. Insightful and blind. Sane and insane.”•	“He was a good reader of people. His eyes in his big round head were shrewd, and he was one of those types who understood others but not himself.”•	“His anger was with himself, but he took it out on me.”•	“The Adderall was really enjoying itself, had me flapping my mouth, had me feeling blithe and clever.”At 208 pages A MAN NAMED DOLL moves along at a quick clip, yet paradoxically there are moments of great detail about mundane things (how a cell phone works) that I could not figure out why they were included.

In 1859 Congressman Dan Sickles shot and killed his wife’s lover across from the White House. Her lover was Phillip Barton Key, a federal attorney and the son of Francis Scott Key, the writer of the “Star Spangled Banner”. It was the makings of a very big scandal for 1859. The text is well researched, especially considering it is about what is (now) considered a very minor event. The text follows the elements leading up to the murder, focuses mostly on the trial that followed, and ends with the fallout from the verdict and its implications. I found it very interesting to read the logic driven rhetorical arguments that the defense and prosecution made during this court case. Author Chris DeRose also delivers a decent examination of the fallout from the trial and the subsequent century of “Unwritten Law” that allowed countless hundreds (thousands?) to get away with murder.A huge problem with this book is that it is sloppily written and edited. Has Mr. DeRose never heard of a transition? There can’t be more than a few in the whole book. In many cases the subject changes from sentence to sentence. This is further complicated by the fact that DeRose does a poor job of distinguishing who is who. There is a large cast of characters in this text and because of the above issues at times it gets confusing.Here are some points/thoughts that have stuck with me upon completion of this read.When I read this line, I just had to shake my head. “Wicked men did not arrive in office by some foreign power. We the people have done it.” Obviously, this is a sentiment whose relevancy will never fade. Some things are always true, no matter the period.When I read this line about the media’s manipulation of the public’s desire I had to chuckle. “It is unfortunately the fashion of the present time to give very minute reports of all cases of exciting wickedness as soon as they get public attention; but the fashion is not a good one. It is sustained now by a popular taste for such things.” It might have been written in 1859, but it is still accurate today. As always, the great truth that “there is nothing new under the sun” is demonstrated. Sensational murder and human depravity get wall to wall national attention. I had to chuckle reading some editorialists’ condemnation of the “graphic” woodcuts some papers were printing of the murder. What would those editorialists say today! Oddly, I found it a bit reassuring. People have always sucked, it’s not a recent development. Consider this comment about a newspaper made at the time, “…persists in pursuing a political opponent and a personal enemy under the cowardly pretext of a concern for public justice.” That is some major truth right there, and particularly so in the case of our uber biased media now. History is always relevant friends. It puts things in perspective.To sum up my experience with STAR SPANGLED SCANDAL, this is a great topic, and an interesting historical footnote that is mediocrely (sometimes confusingly) written. I read it, I enjoyed it. I especially loved the historical intricacies and primary sources Mr. DeRose used.

I have recently adopted a rescue which is probably the reason why I stuck with this text, otherwise I am not sure I would have finished it. It is sloppily plotted, almost juvenile at moments, and the overall reading experience was not one that drew me in. The story is written from two points of view, which alternate. One point of view comes from Evie, a young recovering addict, who has accepted a job to learn how to be a dog trainer and the other from middle aged Mrs. Aberchon, a women carrying her own battle scars. Stylistically I did not care for the chapters that featured Evie’s voice. I will say however, that the last two chapters are easily the text’s strongest.I don’t feel the reading of this book was a total wash because there are some pleasing moments scattered throughout the text. Author Ellen Cooney does a nice job with her descriptions of some of the dogs and personifying some of their thoughts/characteristics. It is relatable. There are also moments of excellent insight, like this clever (and achingly accurate) depiction of loneliness. “She hadn’t liked how it felt to wander around by herself, trying to seem like she was someone temporarily separated from her friends.” Here are some lines/moments from the text that made an impression:•	“…with the outer crust of anyone who used to be tender.”•	“I was supposed to have learned to stop fooling myself.”•	“Abandon. To turn away on purpose from someone you were supposed to never turn away from. Bad verb. Bad word. Bad everything.”•	“Rescue. Best. Verb.

As with its predecessors, author C.J. Sansom take a historical event and weaves a fictional plotline/mystery into events that feels like a plausible explanation for things that really happened. In this text the historical event the mystery is integrated into is Henry VIII’s Great Progress to York in 1541 and the subsequent downfall of Queen Catherine Howard.For a majority of the novel our protagonist, hunchback lawyer Matthew Shardlake, is out of his home turf (London) and this allows the novel to give lots of interesting details about a royal progress, the rebellions in the north of England after the split with Catholicism, and just the difficulties of travel in general in the 1500s. It adds great texture to the book.SOVEREIGN was published in 2006 and was clearly influenced by the media attention and political conversation devoted to torture and its efficacy that was ubiquitous at the time. It fits in the context of the novel, but just occasionally a very modern sounding comment would be made that was jarring and yanked me from the world of 1541 England.Some general thoughts about the text…A new character was introduced that I assume will become a regular in the series. I’m not sure I like her.I saw the ending coming a mile off. It was pretty obvious and a little disappointing, but Sansom was still clever enough with how he integrated it to keep me reading.Some lines from the text that I marked…•	“Do not assume you know my mind or history.”•	“I knew the way to break you was your hatred of what you are.”•	“…how strange were the ways of the mind.”•	“When was justice ever divorced from politics?”•	“But then darkness lies behind so many faces.”•	“Pride and obstinacy are great sins.”•	“But we all have darker sides to our natures, I thought.”This book continues the interesting characterization Sansom is developing with Shardlake, and I am really enjoying how he is developing Shardlake’s disillusion with how the Reformation is being played out in England. It is fascinating watching a character go from the extreme of a position to the center.This series has yet to disappoint, and I fully intend to complete it.

T“Best deal I ever made.” (3.5 stars)My adventures with Israeli art restorer and spy Gabriel Allon continue with THE HEIST, number 14 in this series. This series by Daniel Silva remains my ‘go to’ when I know I want to have a good read that will keep my attention.In this text we get a story that incorporates the Syrian Civil War and the brutal dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad. Once again Silva has done a good job of entwining the fallout from the so called “Arab Spring” with a story that entertains and yet accurately and without bias brings in the real world geopolitics of the moment. Silva does not shy away from the conundrum that the world faces, choosing between a petty killer and criminal strongman like al-Assad and the chaos of radical Islam that would succeed in Syria if he were to fall. It is a frustrating catch-22 that the heroes in this book must face head on.Like most in this series, THE HEIST, is a bit formulaic, but moves along at a satisfying clip. The read is entertaining, but also thoughtful. Consider this reflection a character has when pondering the genocide happening in Syria. “It was almost as if the lessons of the Holocaust had been forgotten. Or perhaps, thought Gabriel, they had never been learned in the first place.” As I write this  Syria has been a slaughterhouse for almost a decade now, with no end in sight.THE HEIST also has one of the more realistic conclusions I have seen in this series. Not completely good, or bad. On an unrelated note, here is a line from the book that I think is as damming an observation about some folks’ relationship to social media as I have come across in a novel. “In the online age, it was more important to live out loud than to live with dignity.” Boy is that sadly true!...more",Notes are private!,0,32,1,"Oct 14, 2021","Oct 18, 2021","Oct 14, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18730158-the-heist

WW II and D-Day will long loom large in history, and in reading this text I gained a different, and new, appreciation for the sacrifices of that generation. In brief, this book is about a group of soldiers from Bedford, Virginia. These soldiers were in the unit that was the first wave on D-Day. You can imagine the rest…This text is filled with minutia of the period. Virginia in the 1930s and England in 1942/43 are made alive in the little details that Mr. Kershaw seamlessly weaves into the text. It is the little details that make this reading experience so good. Scattered throughout the book are also many nuggets about WW II that are vastly interesting. Again, it’s the particular that illuminates the larger event. So many little facts or personal anecdotes scattered here or there that I was thrilled to find. WW II was such an enormous event, we will always be learning something new about it. There are so many stories, so many powerful personal stories to tell about that event. THE BEDFORD BOYS shares a lot of them!Here are some moments/thoughts in the text that stood out to me.This sentiment just shook me…""In the homes that have been darkened by the death of a solider, or have welcomed back the shattered remnants of youth, the burden of war’s tragedy is little lightened by the reassurance that it might have been worse.” The statistics from the invasion force on D-Day are just staggering: 175,000 men, 11,000 planes (not including strategic bombers), 6,939 boats (the largest armada in history). Consider this sentiment, shared with the author by a family member of one of the Bedford Boys lost on D-Day. “You lose a son, you never get over it. That’s what war is really about.”Some other great strengths of this text include:Mr. Kershaw does a nice job alternating between the families of deployed soldiers on the home front (mostly women) and the boys on the front lines. It makes for a complete picture. Also of note is how viscerally D-Day is rendered. We are given first hand accounts by survivors. It is harrowing.I would also be remiss if I did not mention the photographs in the book. They are not of high quality, but they hit home for the reader that war is fought by people who are uncomfortably similar to you and I. Oftentimes I think when reading history we try to put some distance between ourselves and those we are reading about. Never do that! I found myself tearing up while looking at the pictures. They all looked like younger versions of my deceased grandfathers. They were my grandfathers. THE BEDFORD BOYS was not a book I expected to like as much as I did. But it stuck with me. I picked it up at the library, but ended up buying a copy, because I want to own it! In talking about a particular group of people, Mr. Kershaw covered the nation. I will be reading more of his works. I end with this thought from the book that sums it up better than I could. “Here was a generation that had fought and won a ‘good’ war and then possessed the dignity to keep quiet about their sacrifice.”...more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"Oct 10, 2021","Oct 12, 2021","Oct 10, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/540021.The_Bedford_Boys

Had it been a longer book my opinion might be different, but for what it is, the length is just about right. In THE ANATOMIST, author Bill Hayes examines the lives (what little is known) of Henry Gray and Henry Vandyke Carter, the author and illustrator of the famous anatomy book, GRAY’s ANATOMY.It is an interesting read, and Mr. Hayes seems to have done his homework to prepare to write this text. But, too often for my tastes THE ANATOMIST is too much about Bill Hayes. He slips himself center stage at the most awkward moments. It is almost as if he cannot help himself. Hayes’ healthy ego is a distraction, especially in chapter 11 of this text.The greatest strength and weakness of this book come from the same place. The source for much of the material and research for this book are the diaries and letters of Henry Vandyke Carter. Mr. Hayes does a very nice job of analyzing the nature of diary writing, and often makes good observations about such personal writing that are excellent to ponder, even outside the realm of the subject of this book. Consider what Hayes says about when diaries stop being produced. “A diary does not come to a neat, tidy ending. The diarist just doesn’t show up one day.” Anyone who has kept a journal or diary knows the truth of that statement. On the flip side, too often Hayes will assume what an entry by Carter really means. He seems to base this on his personal opinion/desires as opposed to what the circumstances at that time might suggest. I realize conjecture is hard to avoid in a work like this, but even when I agreed with Hayes’ assumptions it annoyed me. It just seemed unfair to his subjects, and it happens a little too often in this text.An especially lovely section is when Hayes makes a enchanting and sentimental corollary between connective tissue on our bodies, and what ‘connection’ means in our everyday lives. It is a delightful observation that occurs on page 173 in the hardcover edition of this book.Another device that works well is the division of text between the lives of the authors of the famous anatomy book, and Mr. Hayes learning about anatomy and doing lots of dissection with cadavers at UCSF.Here are some lines that jumped out at me:•	“Knowledge is endless, and the most experienced person will find that he still has much to learn.”•	“There is no better gauge of a friendship, I believe, than the ability to do nothing together…”•	“I think that one of the strangest things about losing a longtime partner: the very person you most want to talk to about your loss is the person who is gone.”THE ANATOMIST ends very well. I think the last paragraph is almost a darn perfect manner in which to end this text.

Mrs. Goodman comes from a conservative evangelical background, and the simplicity with which she explains her journey of faith might irritate those who wish for more theology or dogma. I was just looking for her story, and in this text, I found it. Mrs. Goodman was idolized in evangelical circles for her simple, homespun, and enthusiastic faith, and I have to admit that my very German/English (thus not overtly emotional) cultural background found myself stirred a few times by her enthusiasm, and love of Jesus, and for proclaiming Him.

Another joy of the text were the little nuggets that Lahr quotes some of subjects as saying. There are a few that are really something to mull over. Take this example from playwright and actor Sam Shepard, “I hate endings…just detest them. Beginnings are definitely the most exciting, middles are perplexing, and endings are a disaster.” Mr. Shepard may have been talking about a play, but I think he was probably talking about much more.

I think mainly because this text is too much of him, he was a firsthand participant in the events the book depicts, and I did not find him all that likable, and thus it got in my way.  This text is about the disastrous spring in 1996 when Mount Everest claimed many lives from the various expeditions (almost all of them commercial) that were attempting to summit her that year. Mr. Krakauer was on one of them, and he was in the midst of the deadly few days that claimed the lives of 6 or so people. It was undoubtedly a traumatic experience, and Krakauer succeeds in conveying that. INTO THIN AIR was a fine read, It is well written and organized, but I was not all that into it until the last 100 pages or so. It is not quite a 3oo page book, so that is not as big a deal as it sounds. Krakauer admits in the book’s opening that he was discouraged from writing about the events on Everest in May of 1996 until he had put some distance and assessment between himself and this very monumental personal event in his life. He waited less than a year. I wish he had taken that advice. Some time, distance, and perspective would have made this text a better read. My biggest issue with the text was the obvious way Krakauer tries to appear modest and humble, as it does not quite fit and appears insincere, even though he goes to great lengths to try to achieve the opposite effect. His double guessing some folks who were clearly heroes of those days, in particular a man named Anatoli Boukreev, who actually saved lives, was a bit too douchey for my tastes.The strength of this book is the same strength I have found with every Krakauer I have read, he knows how to write a sequence of events in a manner that is interesting, and all encompassing. This book does an awesome job of conveying the absolute majesty of Everest, and how insignificant mankind really is when it tries to conquer nature. Mount Everest is not a hospitable place, and the book constantly makes the reader aware of how difficult trying to ascend it is, even in these “modern” times with all our gadgets, etc. Krakauer also writes with a candidness and appraising eye that I appreciated. He even turns that sharp eye on himself, it just did not work for me, as noted above. And that is really it in a nutshell. Krakauer writes best when he is not a subject of his writing. I suspect that is true of most folks, so no hard feelings on my part on that account. Another strength is the amount of technical knowledge that the author conveys in a mostly enjoyable manner. He knows this stuff firsthand. And it comes across in the details. Greatly enjoyed that aspect of it.

Full of intrigue, drama, and human emotion it is a pretty darn good overview of the 245 years of the Plantagenet dynasty and the politics of medieval Europe.Author Dan Jones writes in an accessible, yet still scholarly, manner and his love and obvious affectionate interaction with the historical period comes across in the writing.

The fact that it is a darn good read is just icing on the cake.There are many highlights, but I especially enjoyed the sections that covered the reigns of Edward II and Richard II, two disastrous rulers. Fans of Shakespeare’s play RICHARD II will want to revisit that text after reading this book, and the revisit will be richer for it.Also interesting is how Jones points out that the bloody violence we associate with the Tudors began with a few pivotal executions during this time period that forever changed the way the monarchy interacted with the peers of the realm. This book also makes obviously clear that the Plantagenet rulers as a collective were key players (not always willingly) in the idea that “the king should govern within his own laws and with the advice of the worthiest men of his kingdom.”Jones writes, “During 245 years of turbulent rule, the Plantagenets had forged England in their own image.” Yep, and once again history proves to be more interesting that any fantasy we could muster. This is wild stuff, and it is true! The text’s Epilogue is a great summation of Mr. Jones’ premise, mainly that the Plantagenet dynasty made and shaped what we know as England. After reading this, it’s hard to argue the point. Jones has written books about other topics concerning medieval Europe, as well as a book about the War of the Roses.

Cussy is also a blue (someone who suffers from methhemoglobinemia) so despite being a white woman, she is still “colored” in the hills of Kentucky. The novel takes place in 1936, and deals with poverty, racism, and education…ingredients for a good book.Kim Michele Richardson’s writing is all over the place. At times the prose is simply dreadful, and then a page later there is a beautiful sentence that captures something perfectly. I got the sense that when Richardson was trying to say something “important” her prose got florid and flowery and as a result feels very forced/fake. It felt like the moments where the novel achieved profundity almost happened without her realizing it. The voice of the protagonist is also wildly inconsistent, appearing grounded in the dialect and colloquialisms of eastern Kentucky in one chapter and then sounding like the librarian at Oxford in another. The last 80 pages are pure melodrama. And that is putting it mildly. People drop dead all over the place, ignorance threatens love, and then love conquers all. It is not the specific plot devices that make this melodrama, it is the very surface manner in which they are handled.And yet…I enjoyed reading the story. It is quickly paced, the chapters move along, and there are characters that I liked and loathed, and I got all the feels one is supposed to get with characters like that. The sense of place is well established and I enjoyed that aspect very much. It is also a hopeful text, and I won’t complain about that.This is not a great book, but I found it to be a good story and a fine read.

It is for certain types of people, and I can’t define the “types”, but apparently I’m one of them.I have only read one other Matthew Pearl novel, a long time ago and remember next to nothing about it, except it dealt with Poe, and it did not incite me to read more of his books.In this text we get the adventures of a notorious bookaneer, a literary pirate if you will. Bookaneers are folks who steal writing and sell it to publishers, cutting authors out of the profits for their works. Before the international copyright laws, this was relatively easy to do. This novel is set just before the international treaty/copyright laws go into effect in 1890. One of the last bookaneers wants to get a final score and heads to Samoa to steal a manuscript that legendary author Robert Louis Stevenson is rumored to be working on. The text is told as a reminiscence from the famous bookaneer’s loyal sidekick, and it reads with the formality of the voice of a polite and learned man from the late 1800s. At first I was not into the book, and then suddenly I was. The plot takes us to far flung places, NYC, London, Switzerland, the south pacific, and is a high adventure story, written with a literary subtlety. Within this swashbuckling tale Mr. Pearl introduces several interesting ideas. At one point a character muses on the realization that “books can make you do things without you realizing it.” The character’s thoughts on this have some real depth and it is an idea I pondered on for quite a bit. Another time a character talks about how stories help us “ascend into a life of meaning”. I love that idea! There are many such nuggets peppered throughout the book. It is one of the great pleasures of reading THE BOOKANEER.I could nitpick at items in this novel. For instance the ending is belabored needlessly, but I won’t. I’ll take the enjoyment of the read and leave it at that.Some lines in the text I enjoyed:•	“Books can function in two ways…they can lull us as would a dream, or they can change us, atom by atom, until we are closer to God.

I am no worse the wear for having read it, and am glad that it appeals to people who might not read nonfiction and may pick it up. But for those who read history regularly, I am not sure what to think. First off, by the authors' own admission the subtitle of THE FIRST CONSPIRACY is inaccurate. There was a secret plot, but it is doubtful its aim was to kill George Washington. So why put it on the cover?My biggest issues with the text are simple to note.Every chapter ends with foreshadowing. Every. One. It is juvenile.The book is MASSIVELY redundant and repetitive. States the same thing in a different way time and time again. I suspect because there is not a lot known about this plot, and so the redundancy got this text to book length.The book does a good job of introducing the reader to very minor players in history (who were not minor in the story of this plot) that most of us have never heard of. But the text ends without telling us what happened to any of them. I wish the authors had given some focus to that. Here is this event they were involved in, and this is how life treated them after. I wanted that as a reader.Something I really liked about the text was that there are so many quotes from primary sources, many of them from obscure figures. I loved that aspect of the book, and this feature was very insightful and engaging.As mentioned, I did not love this effort. However, I think it is the perfect sort of text to get someone interested in history. As a teenager falling in love with history I would have adored it.

This book is not a great read, but it is a good one. A story that deserves to be told.The biggest problem with this book is that up until the sinking of the destroyer USS Strong this is sometimes a dull text. Not because the story is not interesting, but because it is rendered in a dull manner. The author, Stephan Harding, is a military historian, and so he wrote about ship positions and details of armaments and requisitions, and that is not of interest to me, although I am thrilled Harding has researched and validated his sources. It is just that this book’s Notes section contains tidbits that I think would have been better placed in the text of the book, and there are bits of the text of the book that could have been hidden in the Notes section for the military wonks to find if so desired. It focuses less on the personal, and more on the reportage. I wish it had been a better mix. While reading this book it is one or the other, but rarely does Harding make it both. A few days after the sinking of the USS Strong Lieutenant Hugh Barr Miller finds himself on Japanese occupied Arundel Island. After a few days (miraculously) Miller does not die and is eventually the only American survivor on the island. THE CASTAWAY’S WAR is at its finest when it focuses on Miller’s story, and what a story it is. Death, overcoming miraculous odds (how Miller came back from literally the brink of death is astounding) regaining the will to live, fighting back…it’s all there in this text.The author was clearly very intentional and thorough in his research and obviously took great pains to only report what he could verify. I appreciate that, immensely. However, be warned, that can also make the reading dry at times. Still, this is a solid book, and a great story of survival.

I think it is a good YA book, but as a 43-year-old there were times it was painfully obvious I am not its intended audience. It is also a bleak book. You see humanity in all its ugliness, through the eyes of a teenager, which makes it all the more painful to witness.This novel is about a Lithuanian family who are deported by the Soviets in 1939 as Stalin tightens his grip on the Baltic region. It is refreshing to read a book that is unabashed in its condemnation of communism and the horror it has consistently unleashed on humanity. The evils of the Soviet Union are on full display here, and any book that points that out will get some praise from me. Some moments that jumped out that do just that included…At one point a character says, “When the rest of the world finds out what the Soviets are doing, they will put an end to all this.” I sighed at the wishful thinking that the West would intervene before they themselves were threatened. Lina, our protagonist, asks at one point the obvious question that anyone who defends communism should start with, “How could Stalin simply take something that didn’t belong to him, something that a farmer and his family had worked their whole lives for? ‘That’s communism, Lina’ Papa had said.” True, concise, and no BS. How refreshing.The author Ruta Sepetys, herself the daughter of a Lithuanian refugee, is skillful in her use of language and I applaud her resisting clichés and cheap use of violence and pain to create an easy thrill. This book is uncompromising, but it is not gratuitous or exaggerated. Sepetys also knows when to make a point and move on, and when a point needs a little belaboring. That, along with the short chapters, make the book read at a rapid rate. This observation made by Lina as the horrors they are living in Siberia seem to compound one after another is a thoughtful, and sad, image. “It couldn’t end like this. It couldn’t. What was life asking of me? How could I respond when I didn’t know the question?” It is painful enough when adults must think along those lines. A child should never have to.BETWEEN SHADES OF GRAY ends on an abrupt note, not shying away from the fact that generations died under communism, and much of the world had no real knowledge of the extent of its horror. For those who were youngsters when Stalin made countries like Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and others simply disappear, there was no light at the end of the tunnel. They died under that brutality, even if they lived to a ripe old age. This is a novel that should be in every school library. Better yet, those who glorify socialism and communism (mainly because they have no real concept of it, and no desire to really know) should read it. Perhaps a YA book is one they could handle....more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,"Jul 07, 2021","Aug 10, 2021","Jul 07, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7824322-between-shades-of-gray

Your true life is the one you end up with, whatever it may be.” I think Anne Tyler is a very deceptive writer. She has quickly catapulted into one of my all-time favorites, mainly because she captures our humanity in the most unpretentious and truthful (and thus powerful) manner. She does not write in a manner that declares her meaning, nor in a fashion that signals to the reader that this is a truthful rendering of experience. Rather, you read and recognize the truth because you have lived. I’m in awe. BACK WHEN WE WERE GROWNUPS follows widowed Rebecca Davitch, and her family, a family with 3 stepdaughters and 1 natural daughter, sons-in-laws, grandchildren, brother-in laws, etc. The text contains numerous family scenes, in fact it opens and closes with them. I personally liked those scenes for their honesty and vitality. They are not big dramatic events; they are the everyday. Birthday parties, wedding receptions, holidays, family picnics, etc. Some moments of highlight, of many I could choose from… A particularly stunning instant is a scene where a character recognizes her love and disdain for her child, simultaneously. The two emotions often go hand and hand, and Tyler captures that paradox brilliantly. And in one sentence no less! Another profound and true moment happens when a character considers grieving, in all of its senses. Its simplicity and depth stopped me cold. The book ends on a perfect note. I felt like I left these characters where they were supposed to be. In the process of life, living the everyday. Although not the novel’s conclusion, at one point the protagonist realizes, “She had just wanted to believe, she supposed, that there were grander motivations in history than mere family and friends, mere domestic happenstance.” The fact that there isn't is comforting to me.Anne Tyler captures the inner life of humans so dazzlingly and so candidly. She puts into words feelings and emotions that we all feel but rarely are able to articulate. Then you read a text like BACK WHEN WE WERE GROWNUPS, and you instantly recognize the thought and wonder how you were never able to express it so truthfully and artfully yourself.

And that is not a bad thing by the way. UNDERMAJORDOMO MINOR is a well written quick read, with a clever and slightly absurdist approach to telling a simple story.The plot…Lucien (Lucy) Minor is offered a job as the under majordomo at Castle Von Aux. His life at home with his mother is pointless, so he accepts. This decision was greatly appreciated by me as it allowed me to meet some interesting characters and read some delightful interactions as Lucy navigates the world he is thrust into when he begins his new career.This is a novel peopled with charming and quirky characters, and the dry wit and snappy dialogue in this text is oftentimes laugh out loud funny. I loved that aspect of it. Almost every conversation between the Majordomo of the Castle Von Aux, Mr. Olderglough, and Lucy is a jewel. Sharp and witty. Joys to read. They abound with lines like this, “You have annoyed me mildly. It is abating as we speak.”A consistent thought I kept having while reading this book was that it felt like a movie made by Wes Anderson. Droll, a bit obtuse, absurd, very understated, and yet with an element that grabs you and keeps you in its grasp. Just a sampling of quotes from the text that stuck with me, for various reasons.•	“You always bring God into arguments you know you are losing, for the liar is lonely, and welcomes all manner of company.”•	“A marvel: how can the days be so full of someone wholly absent?”•	“It was as though you had been waiting for it all along; as if you’d known it was approaching, and so when it arrives you reach out to greet it with an innate familiarity.”•	“I woke up in a foul mood this morning, and the world’s been against me ever since.”•	“…how curious life was, how unfathomably novel, and occasionally, wonderful.”•	“It is a fine and clean and just-born day. There has never been a day quite like today.”•	“Ah, but his greeds and desires got away from him, as greeds and desires are wont to do.”I enjoyed UNDERMAJORDOMO MINOR immensely, except for a scene of sexual fetish whose point I did not get. Perhaps it was meant to demonstrate the depravity of the characters involved, but I was not a fan. It hangs over the book in an uncomfortable manner.All in all, a good story simply told, but yet very well done. It is mostly dialogue, and the banter is one of the novel’s main joys.

Everything that is incommunicable to the rest of the world.” (2.5 stars)Hmm…not sure what to say about this one…LIE WITH ME has some lovely writing and sentiments, but no to little characterization, and the last section is nonsense and smacks of being a plot device, but not true to the story.However, the book is less than 150 pages long, and I did not have to invest much time in it, so I can’t complain all that much. Can I?The plot, two young men in high school become lovers. It is a quick affair, and we are supposed to believe, a deep one (I didn’t) and then they go their separate ways. And the memory and power of this month or so sits over everything else for the rest of their lives. I’m oversimplifying, but not by much.I found many of the tropes cheap. One man who comes to terms with himself and does his own thing, and the other who is repressed and cannot live the truth, etc. AIDS, is flippantly addressed (the bulk of the story takes place in the mid-eighties). The only one who has a life that is successful is the fella who is openly gay, the other dude, well he remains small town, small minded, repressed, etc. It is lazy stereotyping. One of the characters is clearly bi, but this book seems to want to deny him the opportunity to be that.Anyway, I’ll give credit where it is due. There are some very nice moments where I feel the author captures a sentiment in a wonderful manner. Here are some examples:“I am stupidly sentimental: that hasn’t changed much.”“I’m in this state of one-way desire.”“This feeling of love, it transports me, it makes me happy. At the same time, it consumes me and makes me miserable, the way all impossible loves are miserable.”“Nothing touches me more than the cracks in the armor and the person who reveals them.”“It’s even worse than being forgotten, it’s a denial.”“But the absence is, first and foremost, silence.”“I receive his smile like a gift.”“This passion that can’t be talked about, that has to be concealed, gives way to the terrible question: if it isn’t talked about, how can one know that it really exists? One day, when it’s over, when it finally comes to an end, no one will be able to attest to what took place.”“Because this scene not only shows a life lived outside of me. It hurtles me back to a void, to nonexistence, really, in the cruelest way.”“And when you’ve been hurt once, you’re afraid to try again later, in dread of enduring the same pain. You avoid getting hurt in an attempt to avoid suffering: for years, this principal will serve as my holy sacrament. So many lost years.”“The truth, the brutal truth, was that I was in love. Enough to use the right word.”“…because as is so often the case, you eventually heal.”In short, LIE WITH ME is a very average story and book, but it has been beautifully written. It is translated from the original French, so whether the credit is author Philippe Besson’s or translator Molly Ringwald’s, or both, kudos for that. As mentioned, there were lots of lines where I loved the way a human emotion or truth was rendered. They transcend the story they are confined by.

I still love history and sailing ships, and when I came upon most of the series for very little money, I jumped at it. Would it hold up? Having finished MIDSHIPMAN BOLITHIO, the 2 novellas that combined constitute the first chronological book in the series, I may have overrated it as a teenager. But I still enjoyed reading it and will continue with the series. This first book finds young Bolithio dealing with corsair pirates and English smugglers respectively.First, the issues. This text has very little characterization. There are hints of it, and I think it will develop with the series, but this entry lacks depth. I was also annoyed at a 16-year-old being the one who steps up and meets the challenge in a world full of grown experienced men. Richard Bolithio (the series protagonist) is a 16/17-year-old midshipman in the Royal Navy in 1772/73 in this book and in both novellas, he steps into the breech and is the key to things turning out correctly. I can handle this once, but twice? Come on Mr. Kent! The strengths for MIDSHIPMAN BOLITHIO include the vivid creation of the world of the sea, and the life of navy men in the late 1700s is well rendered.

It builds and creeps up on the reader. For the first 50 pages I was not into it, and then I was. It is not heart pounding action, or intellectual guessing games, it is just solid character writing in a very atmospheric setting.The plot, Cal Hooper (retired from the Chicago PD) moves to a small village in western Ireland. A child knocks on his door and asks him to investigate the disappearance of an older sibling. And from there French tells a story that is not about a disappearance, and certainly not a conventional mystery. It transcends that genre. French is deft at creating a living atmosphere and sense of place that is as much a character as anything else in the text. Lines like these I enjoyed:“The dark is busy around here.”“He enjoys the rain. It has no aggression to it.”“Here, the first light spreads across the fields like something holy is happening …”I would categorize THE SEARCHER as a literary mystery, although really the mystery is just the plot device that allows for character development. That does not mean it is boring. There is depth, yes, but also some nice twists. There was one surprise I did not see coming, and one that I did see a mile down the road. But the twist I knew was coming was handled in a manner I was not expecting and was thus still pleasing.The truth of human experience and interaction is demonstrated in THE SEARCHER, and that alone makes it good.I end with some more lines that I think demonstrate that point.* “…hammering on and on at something that’s never going to break gets a man nothing but tired and sore.”* “He sometimes gets the feeling that Donna has methodically erased all their good times from her memory, so that she can move on into her shiny new life without ripping herself up. If he doesn’t keep them in his, they’ll be gone like they never happened.” (This FLOORED me!)* “His four best buddies were among the reasons he left Chicago; the depth and detail with which they knew him had come to feel unsafe…”* “Everyone was always talking about talking, and the most moral person was the one who yelled at the most other people for doing the talking all wrong.” (This is from a moment in the text that in its entirety destroys “woke” culture, although I am not sure that was the intention)* “Everything he’s been since that moment has been worth nothing, and he doesn’t even know what the moment was.”* “Complicating this is the fact that he can’t remember the last time he was in a room with a woman he liked the idea of talking to, and he’s unsure whether this is a point in favor of sticking around or of getting the hell out of Dodge.”* “Seems like I’m always looking for something to hold me down.

Storms series. CLOWNFISH BLUES was a reliable addition to Serge’s Florida adventures.This text finds Serge living his own version of the old television series “Route 66”, and Dorsey incorporates a nice gimmick with the Florida state lottery. In fact, many of the book’s best moments deal with Serge’s views on the lottery. (He does not think much of it.) It is a fun story with numerous plot lines that converge nicely for a big ole climax. It’s made for the beach, where I discovered and read this series, and it is a perfect book for such moments. Every once in a while Dorsey will throw in some profundity with the chaos. I love when lines like this pop up in a book about a gonzo, history loving, serial killer, “Everyone should be ecstatically happy every second! We’re alive on earth, after all! When did that get taken for granted?”Some other fun lines/moments from this text:* “I’m only tapping into the possibilities that everyone else just assumes are off-limits simply because they lack the imagination to think of it themselves.”* “America was founded on the principle of never judging a hobby. In the idiom of the times, the Founding Fathers called it ‘the pursuit of happiness,’ but we all really know they were worried about Franklin’s big kite-flying drunk-fest coming up and wanted to give themselves some cover from the wives.”* “…don’t buy lottery tickets. The store won’t tell you this because they’re in on it, but the whole thing is a fool’s bet. It’s a tax on people who are bad at arithmetic. Buy food instead, that’s a sure thing.”* “So I’m guessing you’re a regular on the dickhead rodeo circuit?”CLOWNFISH BLUES is a solid addition to the series.

BAD MONKEY is a fine book to entertain, just don’t get caught up in some of the more ridiculous details.

A mystery set in the Civil War…sure, I’ll give it a go.What an excellent find I made!This is one of the most historically rich and atmospheric novels I have read in a while. It feels and reads like it was written in the late 1800s. The era breathes. Author Owen Parry took pains to convey accuracy and rich atmosphere. It shows. I was immersed in the world. Mr. Parry has created in for novel’s protagonist a recent Welsh immigrant to America, a veteran of Queen Victoria’s’ armies in India, and just an all around decent and very human man named Abel Jones. Jones is a noble man, who sees his weaknesses, and who has made terrible mistakes, but is still a good principled man. His narrative voice is so Welsh in its construction, so funny in its observations, and so true to life. Jones repeats himself, has predictable patterns of speech, reveals his prejudices through the things he thinks and says, and is just so darn real I could have lifted a pint with him. If Abel Jones drank, which he does not, he “signed the pledge”. He has an immigrant’s love of America and its possibilities. I really liked him, its as simple as that.The story takes place in 1861, in the early days of the Civil War, mostly in Washington DC. A joy of the text are remarks that characters make that are clever allusions that we who know (or should know) the coming events appreciate. The mystery in the text is an interesting one, and plausible considering the time period, but for me, it was really secondary to the excellent writing. The novel is unflinching in its portrayals of the attitudes of the time, but it does not use them gratuitously, or in a ‘see how superior we are now’ manner. It just incorporates them as the everyday facets of the time. Without comment or notice. The author trusts the reader to know those views are not standard or correct.Some lines I liked…there are many I could have chosen:* “What man with a brain in his head would waste his breath on politicians?”* “There is decency in men, and goodness, and we must never forget that.”* “…the softness of the old and the callous brutality of the present, the drabness and the beauty so  mixed up you soon stopped trying to make sense of it all and just lived.”* “I knew enough of their heads to know there is more in them than sense.”* “There is a quality of fear that makes a man run toward the object of his terror.”* “It’s a terrible thing to be without hope.”* “Men without Faith must substitute a dream, and mad dreams there are in plenty.”* “…but we cannot hold the Irish to the same standards we apply to civilized people.”* “But his voice that night was full of what we men are, of loneliness and the mix of bitterness and  conviction that pushes us from one day to the next.”* “You had to stop to see the picture whole, to feel that bigness of unspoken hopes.”There are lots more I could choose. All I will say is that their context makes lines like these even richer.Even the author’s afterward in this book is good reading!

I have liked all, to some degree. They are solid books. I’m glad I read them. They are not brilliant, but they are dependable.THOMAS JEFFERSON THE ART OF POWER is a strong single volume biography of Jefferson’s very prolific life. It is mostly surface level, but a single volume about this dude would have to be. Meacham does get a little precious when he keeps reminding the reader that Jefferson was a “white man”. Thanks for the clue Jon. Is that a flaw? Why not focus on his time in history and how he was a product of (and in some other ways) an exception to it (as are most of us) and leave it at that. The press was vicious in the early days of our democracy (some things never change) and Jefferson was abused by it, and also utilized it on opponents. One thing he said in his second inaugural address is the difference between the founders of America, and the current generation. Check this out, “The abuses of an institution, so important to freedom and science are deeply to be regretted…the marketplace should decide. Censorship should be in the hands of the people.” Meaning, everything is a go, no speech regulated by government, etc. In a capitalistic society if something does not sell (by pleasing an audience) it will go away. And that’s the end of it. It’s a lesson for now. There is so much value and wisdom in the writings and lives of our Founding Fathers.Meacham also demonstrates in this book another great lesson to be learned from early American leaders. Despite political differences, at some point you have to put aside rancor. Jefferson hated, and was hated by, John Adams, Alexander Hamilton, and lots of others. But in then end, a bust of Hamilton was in the entrance hall of Monticello (placed there by Jefferson) and Adams and Jefferson had a long and friendly correspondence later in life. In a letter to Jefferson Dr. Benjamin Rush (a founder who deserves more attention) wrote to Jefferson (in an attempt to reconcile Jefferson and Adams) “Many are the evils of a political life, but none so great as the dissolution of friendships, and the implacable hatreds which too often take their place.” One thing that THOMAS JEFFERSON THE ART OF POWER does very well is make clear how much the Founding Fathers believed wholeheartedly in the values they espoused. Jefferson was a thorn in the side of President Washington (for a myriad of reasons). Looking back now we can pass judgment on those reasons; some were valid, some not, but these men where doing something unheard of, and for 40 or so years the American experiment was one misstep away from dissolving. These men fought each other viscously, stood up for the things that concerned them, but always with a greater goal in mind. That goal being that it was not about them, but the bigger picture. That trait is one thing most of them seemed to share. And it worked!This text’s Epilogue is a nice summation of the influence of Jefferson and of his ability to wield power effectively. Historically Jefferson has appealed to presidents of vastly different beliefs, from Wilson to Reagan. It speaks to the depth of his thought and writings that political opposites pull value and truth from his life and work.Thomas Jefferson was a brilliant, hypocritical, forward thinking, stubborn, well read, generous (I could go on) man. He was much more than either current political extreme would like to brand him. Jon Meacham has done a nice job of keeping Jefferson in his time and acknowledging his powerful place and influence in history....more",Notes are private!,0,40,1,"May 12, 2021","May 30, 2021","May 12, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18112171-thomas-jefferson

Having stated the obvious, let us move on. This first-person novel is written as a memoir of Herbert Wadlough, Personal Assistant and Deputy Chief of Staff to President Thomas Tucker. In Christopher Buckley’s world Ronald Reagan is succeeded by a democrat from Idaho in 1988. The four years of the Tucker presidency are an unmitigated, and funny, disaster. Over the course of the Tucker train wreck of an administration our narrator is demoted to being the First Lady’s Chief of Staff, and eventually re-promoted back to his former position during the calamitous years of 1988-1992. Christopher Buckley has deftly created a voice with his characterization of Herbert Wadlough where Herbert's self-importance and delusions are always questioned by the reader when compared to those of the folks who surround him. One of the joys of reading a good Buckley text is the display of wit and the abounding number of clever and classical allusions throughout the book. At one point our narrator laments upon losing an executive parking space, “I’ve grown accustomed to the space.” (Come on folks, that’s funny!) It is nothing spectacular, but THE WHITE HOSUE MESS is a sharp satire of political memoirs and the reasons they are written. All of that, wrapped up in a delightful farce.

My parents loved him, as the Carter presidency was an unmitigated disaster for the middle class. DUTCH is my first book about Reagan. I am glad there are other options out there.I have really struggled with what to write about DUTCH. I would call it a literary memoir, as it reads more like a character study than a biography. And I am not sure that is a good thing. The biggest problem with this text is that there is way too much of the author. Mr. Morris made himself a character in the life of Ronald Reagan, and I feel like I read a novel (a well written and an insightful one, I admit) but still, a novel, about the life of Ronal Reagan. I hated Edmund Morris’ insertion of himself into the story, there are easily 100 (or more) pages of this book where Edmund talks about himself and his made up version of his life. Who picks up a memoir of Ronald Reagan to read a fictional version of the author's life? I saw a writer who said this about DUTCH, “Morris has produced a fiction in which he is the main character, and his life is interspersed with impressions and memories of Reagan.” Sadly, that is a true statement. Morris makes up a fake version of himself, complete with a fake son who is an SDS radical who hates Reagan and disappears into the underground as a result of choices in the sixties. Ridiculous. Easily the first half of this book hinges more on Morris’ fake story, than Reagan’s real one. Having said that, the second half of this text is better than the first because the fictional Morris disappears more and more, and the real one (who was picked by the Reagans to write Ronald’s biography) takes a back seat. As mentioned, Morris was a good writer, and there are times that he makes brilliant, compelling, and powerful observations about Ronald Reagan and his greatness. Chapter 37 (“The Shining City”) is a sentimental and beautiful observation of the final months of the Reagan presidency, and is awesome reading. Fiction can reveal great truths, and there are moments where this text achieves that.DUTCH also induced in me the feeling that most books that deal with the past do, that there “is nothing new under the sun.” Many of the things Reagan dealt with are circling back around, and many of the things he said could have come out of the mouths of leaders since. There were times while reading something Reagan said that I thought Trump or Obama had said the same thing, and they had. Everything old is new again. Reading over this  is telling, as it mirrors the problem with DUTCH. There is too much “Morris” mentioned. I will read other books about Reagan.

Thank you for creating their lifetimes of love, friendship, joys, and errors. Thank you for doing what the great poets do, writing in a manner that implies greater truths than the words alone convey. LEAVING CHEYENNE touched my soul. What a gift that is.Thank you!Much love,BrianLEAVING CHEYENNE is a stunning book that follows three friends from their teenage years to old age/death and Larry McMurtry has created convincing characterizations at each stage. How does one do that? I felt like I experienced three lifetimes in a book that is under 300 pages! The text picks up in the nineteen teens and ends in the early nineteen sixties. Divided into three parts, each part is told in first person by one of the 3 main characters. Part 1 is the teenaged Gideon Fry, Part 2 is the middle aged Molly Taylor, and Part 3 is from sixty four year old Johnny McCloud. The changing perspectives, and the changing values and thoughts that the different ages bring combine to tell a complete story about all three characters and the very intermingled lives they lead. In each part the voice of the narrator is spot on, truthful to the character, and the reader is immersed completely.Some highlights:McMurtry deftly captures the jealously and love that two men feel in a best friendship, oftentimes in the same moment. There is an instance where Gideon is glad that his friend Johnny does not succeed in winning the attentions of a women (Molly) that they both pine for. At the same time he is depressed because Johnny does not succeed. The paradoxical truth the moment conveys is brilliantly done.Check this out, “And I knew I oughtn’t to say a word: the more I said, the more we would lose. But I loved him, so I fought anyway.” Anyone who has ever been in a real relationship can ponder a long time on a sentence like that. The text is strewn with moments like this. In this instance, Molly is fighting with Gideon, and knows that the fight will cause more problems than it solves, and yet the fight is necessary. When I finished the novel, I kept staring at the last page. No spoilers, but the awesome power of it is all that it does not say.LEAVING CHEYENNE was my 6th McMurtry novel.

Not very realistic, but it piles on the fun reveals, and the “hero” of the story is a white-collar criminal. Maybe even a Robin Hood, so you can’t get too worked up about his getting away with a crime. And does he really get away with it? The plot is simple, Patrick Lanigan is a lawyer on the Gulf Coast who fakes his own death, and then steals 90 million dollars from his former law firm, three weeks after he is supposedly buried. Naturally, the folks who lost 90 million bucks go looking for it, and Patrick. The text begins with them finding him. The enjoyment of this story is that as the novel progresses, we realize that Patrick is one step ahead of pretty much everyone he encounters. And that makes for easy delightful reading. Especially since the folks he is mainly ahead of the game with are either criminals or the government. And both of those entities do very unethical things in this story, so the reader cheers as David keeps nipping Goliath in the shins. There is not a lot to say about THE PARTNER. It is a legal thriller with pleasing (although not unexpected) twists. As far as books in that vein go it is a fine effort. The ending irritated me, but only because it was what I suspected might happen, and I did not want it to. However, in a cosmic justice sense, and in the world of human behavior it is probably perfectly appropriate.

A lie gives mostly pain.” (3.5 stars) BEACH MUSIC is a novel that requires you to suspend your disbelief, then suspend it some more, then stomp on it, kick it in the mouth, and then suspend it again. I was all over the place with this book! At times it is so melodramatic, it borders on being a soap opera. And yet you keep reading because you recognize Pat Conroy’s talent, and you trust him to snap out of it (he does for brief interludes) and because you don’t want to miss when he does have stunning moments. And he does have them! The text careens from one ridiculous plot device to another. The protagonist in some form or other deals with the Holocaust, suicide, cancer, a terrorist attack, being marooned at sea, Vietnam, a trial, schizophrenia, manslaughter, the Holocaust…again…among others. Literally, there are plot elements for a dozen books in here. It is like every idea Conroy ever had he crushed into one story. An editor was needed for this text. A good one would have made this an excellent novel. I can deal with rolling my eyes from time to time, so really there were only two things that made me hateful about this book. First was the protagonist’s 8-year-old daughter, Leah. She is written as a simpering, cloying waif much smarter than her years, and it set my teeth on edge. It is a terrible characterization, and there are moments where she was so unrealistically rendered that it was borderline criminal. The second issue was Part VI of the novel which was such schlock that I would have thrown the book across the room and never picked it up again if it were not 40 pages from the end. Among the highlights for me was the protagonist’s mother, Lucy McCall, and her storyline. Most of the book’s most touching and truthful moments concern her. Another great strength is Conroy’s writing. Despite the ridiculousness of the plot, Conroy is such a talented wordsmith that at times I found myself emotionally invested. He also vividly creates the atmosphere of the low country of South Carolina, an area that I love!Some moments that I found well done and/or truthful to our humanity: •	“…telling jokes and stories that are both the source of intimacy and evasion among teenage boys.” •	“Literature was where the world made sense for me.” •	“Drifting through books, I found the pleasures of discovery to be an almost daily occurrence.” •	“Holocaust. One English word should not be required to carry so many human hearts.” •	“For without music, life is a journey through a desert that has not ever heard the rumor of God. In music’s sweet harmony, I had all the proof I needed of a God who held the earth together between the staffs, where the heavens lay.” •	“I want to make someone happy…I might even have a gift for it.” •	“But I had lived a long time knowing of the hardships and perils that eat around the edges of even the strongest loves.” •	A survivor who says of the Holocaust, “Well, you can imagine what it is like. Except you cannot.” •	“…that beautiful music was a place a suffering man could hide.” •	“I had recently become acutely aware that mistranslation, mistakes of emphasis, and the inevitability of a flawed interpretation of an experience could lead to an imperfect view of things.” Despite the sheer amount of ridiculous stuff that BEACH MUSIC contains, I kept reading. Why? Because it is a good story. However, that is also this novel’s weakness. Because the sheer volume of events that swirl around the protagonist is unrealistic, you never forget that it’s just a story. It does not capture you consistently because you are always being drawn out of it.Even though BEACH MUSIC is a soap opera, it is still soap opera written by a talented man (in serious need of an editor). You read Pat Conroy and you go “Oh my, so many words’…which at times evolves into, “Oh my, so many beautiful, perfect words.”...more",Notes are private!,0,65,1,"Mar 08, 2021","Mar 23, 2021","Mar 08, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1765790.Beach_Music

If it had been written by someone other than Nick Hornby it would have been a waste. But Hornby is an excellent observer of relationships and has moments in his books that are startlingly simple human truths, and so while I was not blown away by this text, or even cared for it all that much, I still enjoyed reading it.“Just Like You” is a novel about a mixed race couple, who also happen to be 20 years apart in age. Taking place mostly in 2016 amidst the swirl of the Brexit vote, and ending in 2019, it usually avoids the traps that a lot of modern novels fall into. Most importantly, it avoids smug glorification of the author’s politics. At first I was annoyed by the use of Brexit as a device in this novel, because I thought that Hornby was preaching to me, but then he turns that on its ear, and I realized there are some didactic characters, but the author hid himself pretty decently, with one glaring and irritating exception which I will choose to ignore for this .The subject of this novel is tricky. A 20 year age gap. What do 22 and 42 year olds have in common? Hornby handles it without clichés, and the ending is appropriate, because it is ambiguous, as is the future of any relationship.Here are a few lines that stuck out, for various reasons, to me as I was reading:“The shrug was a carefully casual way of disguising acute and undigested pain.”“Neither happy nor unhappy. Like most people.”“Why using punctuation in a text was sexy, he couldn’t say, but he found himself wondering what it would be like to sleep with someone like that.”“How was one supposed to go home and feel as if one’s world was ending if it wasn’t?”“Now all they had to do was walk, and see how far they could get.”“Deciding to forgive, after all, was not the same thing as forgiveness.”And then there was this gut puncher-“But five is a difficult time at a weekend when you’re on your own.”“Just Like You” is not a great book, but I enjoy Nick Hornby because he cuts to the truth of human experience, especially in matters of the heart. And he is usually good for a few chuckles along the way.

It is also the first book in what become known as the Thalia trilogy. For the first 20 pages or so the story did not grab me, and then suddenly it did, and I was in full throttle. It is a short text, so once it grabs you it tears you across the finish line quickly! The story takes place on a ranch outside of Thalia Texas in the years after WW II. Told mostly from the point of view of 17-year-old Lonnie Brannon, the primary focus of the novel is Lonnie, his 85-year-old grandfather, and Lonnie’s step uncle, known as Hud. These men, in different stages of life, create as a whole the picture of Texas manhood in all its increments. This is the fifth McMurtry novel I have read thus far, and in all of them there is no judgment. The author does not telegraph how you are supposed to feel or interpret events. He just depicts events with flesh and blood characters, people whose motives you may partially know, or think you know. But judgment on their choices and actions lays squarely on the reader’s shoulders. McMurtry wants no part of telling you how to take it. I love that about his writing! Some highlights in this text for me include: There is a beautiful and atmospheric moment where Lonnie takes a ride on the ranch at sunup. The writing is, in a word, lovely. Late in the book Lonnie attends a funeral of someone close to him, and through his perspective we get a view of death that those of us who have reached middle age have probably forgot we ever had. It is honest, but not cloying. One of the best depictions of a person’s thoughts during a funeral that I have come across. The last line of the Epilogue is a perfect ending, and one that takes a few minutes after reading it to understand why it is so. “Horseman, Pass By” is a modern story of the American west.

In fact, these three novels have kindled in me an interest in WW II much stronger than it was previously. With “No Less Than Victory” Shaara ends his trilogy concerning the European theater of WW II, and it is a fitting conclusion to the two books that preceded it.This novel is organized into 3 parts. Part One deals with the Battle of the Bulge, Part Two the Allied push into Germany (concluding at the crossing of the Rhine River) and Part Three focuses on the Battle of Berlin and the fall of Germany. All of these things happened in a matter of 5 months and so the text moves along briskly. Just like his previous books, this one has alternating viewpoints changing with each chapter. Par for the course we get real people (Eisenhower, Patton, Albert Speer, among others) mixed in with made up characters. But unlike the previous books this one is mostly told from the POV of a fictional soldier named Benson. I enjoyed this perspective, and Shaara has created in Benson a man who does his duty, but struggles with fright/fear (an impulse he never really shakes). Shaara renders him with a thoughtful and sympathetic realism. After Germany falls and Benson fears that he will be transferred to the Pacific before he is mustered out, you can hardly blame the man for wanting his war to be done.Some highlights of the text-A chapter where Churchill eviscerates FDR to Eisenhower for his manipulation by (and capitulation to) Stalin at the Yalta Conference. I am assuming this moment is from Shaara’s imagination, but what Churchill says of FDR in this scene, history has borne out. There is a very nice moment where some soldiers who survive the Battle of the Bulge talk candidly about that experience and how it will be retold in the years ahead. “And what about these guys right here? Most of them are new, and they’ll never see a German who’s not already done for. The rest of us spent most of our time running for our damn lives. Nice thing to tell your grandkids.”The discovery of the labor camp at Ohrdruf, and the Allies learning the extent of the concentration camps is harrowingly portrayed. Shaara does a good job at capturing the anger and shock it created in the Allies towards the Germans.And finally, there is a frantic and vivid depiction of the fall of Berlin, told from the German POV.Both of my grandfathers served in combat units during the war, in Europe, and Mr. Shaara’s trilogy brings me to an even greater appreciation for them, and their service with its thoughtful and personal examination of that conflict.

This text is not what I anticipated and it exceeded any expectations I had for it. “Pavel and I” takes place in postwar Berlin in the winter of 1946/47. The frigid setting is vividly rendered. The book itself seems cold to the touch. It is a literary thriller, but that seems an inadequate descriptor.This was my first book by Dan Vyleta, but it will not be my last. “Pavel and I” was Vyleta’s first novel, and it is a remarkable debut. His writing is unique in style, thoughtful in content, and clever in its plotting and presentation. The novel is heavily influenced by Dickens and Dostoevsky (according to the author’s afterward) and Vyleta’s clever use of the narrator in this text is well executed. The novel's enigmatic protagonist will leave you with questions. I’ll let you unravel that for yourself, go read it, rather than me pontificate on it.Here are some moments/quotes in the text that I really enjoyed:""Pavel suffered from that terminal disease called empathy, forever trying to exchange points of view even with the boot that kicked him.”“…his tongue kept tripping over the edge of words…”“I have often noticed that the past adds a sense of clarity to affect; in the present, one too often strains to feel anything much at all.”“Unsure whether to be touched by her bout of sentimentality, or see it as but another symptom of a life so very barren of tenderness, one had to invent emotion, against all the evidence.”“You imagine it: a storyteller locked out of his own tale. It turns one into a historian, that retrospective scrounger of fact. I cannot think of a more sordid occupation.”“Against this rich canvas of history, my prime interest, of course, lay with the life paths that had so recently intersected with my own.”“The thing is, when does one ever get to do that? To talk of the essential things, all those thoughts and experiences a man shuts up in his chest and gags on for half his life? They don’t spill out but once or twice in a lifetime- and very often not at all.”“You can convince yourself of all sorts of things.”“Pavel and I” is a well written novel, a good story, a skillfully and uniquely told tale.

This long book follows the life of Queen Mary from birth to death, and is presented from a 3rd person narrator who spends most of the text in Mary’s head. However, Ms. George does change it up from time to time and we get occasional chapters from other perspectives. This was a good choice as it enhances the story and fills out the whole picture, and also gives a clearer insight into the character of Mary.Like many who write historical fiction, George seems to write as much “plausible fiction” as possible, but there are more than few times in this book where the speculative parts seems more than a little gratuitous to me, and I could not figure out the point of including them. The other issue I had with the text is that for a bit in Part III it seems to run out of steam. It is the weakest part of the text, as there is a lot of telling, not a lot of showing. George tries to cover some rather uneventful years in Mary’s life quickly, I get it, I just don’t think she was as successful as she normally is in conveying it.However, by and large the novel is a very good one, and there are moments that are structured brilliantly. I did not know a lot of details of Mary’s life, and there was a pivotal (and unexpected) moment in Mary’s reign that George awesomely renders, as it sets Mary up on a collision course with history.As seems to be par for the course with George, it is her ability to capture fully dimensional protagonists that is this novel’s main strength. One exceptionally good instance of this begins on page 561 where the writing is so introspective and acute that George’s skill at capturing the internal character of people cannot be denied. Another strong moment appears in chapter 7 of Part III where Mary writes a journal entry where she examines her relationship with God. It is an achingly accurate appraisal of one’s relationship with their Creator, and I felt like an intruder on a personal moment as I read it. Mary reflects on her relationship with God while examining her prayer life and it is nothing short of profound.As I read I was curious how George would end this book, and the novel’s final chapter is a perfect and clever ending to this monumental text. I was not disappointed.The life of Mary Queen of Scots was one ripe for a novelist to take on.

I had a little knowledge of the occupation of Nanking before reading this book, but I had never heard of the “International Safety Zone” and the heroes who created and maintained it. I am glad I learned about those folks. Their names should be known to us. The section of the text that focuses on this aspect is the strongest. I suspect because there were quite a few primary sources for Chang to use, and fewer speculations in this part of the book than in others.Now the problems with this book… a big issue is that the writing/organization is not good. The organization jumps around, is sporadic in focus, and very vague and generalized. It even contradicts itself a few times and a book along these subject lines should take great care to not do that. Another issue is that the scholarship is seriously flawed. At times in the text Chang brings up sources which she freely admits were false. So why include them? I think for the simple reason of playing with the reader’s emotions. That is cheap, the truth is horrible enough, and it does not need embellished. One feels like a heel questioning the veracity about a book that deals with a horrific subject like this. But the fact is that the research is sloppy and the event, and the reader, deserve better. She also uses the word “probably” too much in this text, which further undermines for me the whole truth about what I’m reading. There are elements in this book that cut to the quick, and that are astute. At one point Chang muses, “Apparently some quirk in human nature allows even the most unspeakable acts of evil to become banal within minutes, provided only that they occur far enough away to pose no personal threat.” A biting observation about one of the persistent flaws in human history.Towards the end of this rather short read (another issue is its shallow exploration of events) Chang writes, “Whatever the course of postwar history, the Rape of Nanking will stand as a blemish upon the honor of human beings. But what will make the blemish particularly repugnant is that history has never written a proper end for the story.” Unfortunately, “The Rape of Nanking” does not provide that proper ending either. This is a story that needs to be told. I wish this text told it better. Of a curious side note, at one point Chang writes “In many ways private-sector self-censorship can be more insidious than government censorship because it is subtler and harder to pinpoint”. Written in 1997 those words (in winter of 2021) while we are in the midst of Big Tech private sector censorship has a truthful and powerful ring to it....more",Notes are private!,0,38,1,"Jan 12, 2021","Jan 17, 2021","Jan 12, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/95784.The_Rape_of_Nanking

That’s your doing.” (3.5 stars)This sparse, simple little book is a quick and very direct exploration of loneliness and companionship (which is a form of love) during the winter of our lives. Two people who have been widowed and live alone come to an agreement to sleep together (literally, just share a bed) to help abate loneliness. This proposition is proposed on the novel’s first page, and things go from there.“Our Souls at Night” follows Addie and Louis (the two folks referenced above) from the beginning of this arrangement to its end. It is mostly dialogue (sans quotation marks) between Addie and Louis, and the language and style is spare, with no extraneous words or descriptions. And yet, despite the very limited language, I felt like this book said a whole lot. Was it in between the lines, or what my own head added, or a bit of both? I assume the latter. I appreciate the surface nature of the text, and its lack of focusing too in depth on any one incident. The short, quick chapters just keep moving along, just as life does, with no explanation or analysis. Those things happen on the go in the real world, just as they do in this text, and one has to accept them and continue moving or be run over.I gave this book 3.5 stars for no other reason than that I hated the ending, mainly because I can’t stand when someone uses a child to dictate and manipulate a result they want, and a character in this novel does that, and I wanted to throttle him for it. I could not get past it. But that is my own selfish want for the novel, and I freely admit that. This was Mr. Haruf’s last book before he passed away. It has inspired me to revisit his novel “Plainsong”, which I read many years ago, probably when I was too young to appreciate it.“Our Souls at Night” is a lovely, meditative book.

So it made sense that I would pick up its sequel. “Bloody Crimes” is not as good a book as the one that preceded it. The beginning and the end of this text are pretty strong. The middle section, which tells the parallel stories of Lincoln’s funeral train’s journey from DC to Springfield, Illinois (where Lincoln is buried) and Jefferson Davis’ flight from Richmond as the Civil War was ending lagged for me. Swanson gets caught up in too many ridiculous (and unnecessary) details in this part.“Bloody Crimes” opens with a haunting prologue that focuses on a shared experience that Lincoln and Davis had while presidents of waring nations during a bloody conflict… the death of a son while residing in the executive mansion. In fact, one of the strongest aspects of this book is the interesting exploration of the many similarities between Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis. It is a bit eerie, and I love history for that connective experience that most of us forget to consider. An interesting side note-I did not know, until reading this book, that Lincoln was elected with less than 40% of the popular vote. Over 60% of the country voted for someone else! It is facts like this that the current mob of historical ignoramuses (I’m talking to you, Electoral College haters) don’t even begin to know.History matters. Unvarnished history. History that is not whitewashed or purged so that only certain things are remembered. It matters because it is made up of people, people exactly like us, and knowledge of history allows us to honor our past (all aspects of it) as part of the human condition, and helps nudge us from making some of its more ugly aspects a reality again in the future. “Bloody Crimes” tries to do that, and for that reason alone I embrace it.Consider this- ""Before you lies the future, a future full of golden promise, a future of expanding national glory, before which all the world shall stand amazed. Let me beseech you to lay aside all rancor, all bitter sectional feeling, and to make your places in the ranks of those who will bring about a consummation devoutly to be wished - a reunited country""It sounds like it could have been said by Abraham Lincoln. But it wasn’t. It was Jefferson Davis in 1888. When I read this in “Bloody Crimes” I felt a jolt of hope. America eventually reunited after the darkest period of its history.

Right off the bat Mr. Black hits at the heart of why a lot of people have a special feeling for the Christmas season. He writes, “As I have grown older… I find myself getting sadder and sadder. Yet the sadness is oddly comforting, as the memories flow in of my brother and the many friends whom I have spent these holiday times with but who are no longer with us. For in the midst of the sense of loss and the tears, these times remembered bring a sense of joy. For some inexplicable reason these memories are conjured up by the Christmas season, though they have nothing to do with the holiday. Go figure.” Christmas is a time for memories, and there are more than a few references in this text about the idea of not being able to spend the season with people who we wish we could be with. It is a sobering thought, and one people should focus on as they get pissy about the dumb things many folks get themselves worked up about. “Christmas may be about the birth of the baby Jesus, but it also makes you think a lot about the people you want to spend time with but can’t anymore.”The book is full of Black’s trademark rants, and his plethora of swearing (which I could do without and which he freely admits he overuses). There are funny, and thoughtfully accurate, points about cooking verses easting, being a little more generous with those in real need, and some interesting thoughts on relationships and being single and the good/bad aspects of both. And there are a few chuckles along the way.“I’m Dreaming of a Black Christmas” ends with a nice chapter about the author’s time on a USO Christmas tour for the troops in the Mid-East.

The good and the bad, and our struggle to be ruled by one or the other, acknowledging that both are inherent in our natures. It is a beautiful book filled with people I felt strongly about, and all of them so fully and wonderfully human.Steinbeck continues to impress me with his ability to create a complete characterization in only a few sentences. Even cameo roles in this text are flesh and blood people. One of the joys of this book was that I genuinely enjoyed peeking into the lives of many of these characters. One highlight is the character of Samuel Hamilton and his wife and various offspring. I fell a little bit in love, and the parts of the book that focused on them soared in my opinion. The Trask twins are also well rendered and what Steinbeck does with the two of them (no spoilers here) is brilliant! The people of “East of Eden” are so real, that at the death of a truly unsavory character I felt unexpected sadness. This was not a good person, a monster even, but they still had a humanity. I love when a novel forces me to remember that.Chapter 34 of this text is everything. One of the best summations of what the human story is that I have come across in a novel. And the closing paragraph of this chapter…“We have only one story. All novels, all poetry, are built on the never-ending contest in ourselves of good and evil. And it occurs to me that evil must constantly respawn, while good, while virtue, is immortal. Vice has always a new fresh young face, while virtue is venerable as nothing else in the world is.”Wow!At one point Steinbeck writes, “In uncertainty I am certain that underneath their topmost layers of frailty men want to be good and want to be loved.” There is a lot in that statement, and a hopefulness that I (and I hope all of us) refuse to yield.When you read a novel, and you see yourself reflected in many ways, in bits of many characters, you know that you are reading a great story of the human condition.“East of Eden” is such a book....more",Notes are private!,0,177,1,"Dec 14, 2020","Dec 29, 2020","Dec 14, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4406.East_of_Eden

A story about Shakespeare, a fictionalized scenario that could be plausible (filling in the gaps of Shakespeare’s life we don’t know about) and a mystery romp in 1500s Europe. And I did like it, just not as much as I was hoping too. And the fault might be mine.“The Spy of Venice” has a great concept, and it is a clever manner to explain Shakespeare’s “Lost Years” where we don’t know what he was up to. The novel creates a fun fiction and it creates a scenario that gives us answers to inspirations for some of the Bard’s later great works.Regular readers of Shakespeare will love the plethora of allusions to his work strewn throughout the text. They are everywhere! Some deliciously subtle, others very obvious, most all of them shrewdly deployed. There are many, and I have no doubts that I missed more than a few of them.Those familiar with Shakespeare’s world and his works will also recognize real people from his life in the text as characters and will also see many fictionalized characters encountered by young Billy S. that the author (Benet Brandreth) has given traits that are meant to show them as inspirations for characters that later populated Shakespeare’s plays. This enhances the idea that Shakespeare's greatness lay in his ability to create wonderfully human characters, ""Hold the mirror up to nature"" as it were. Observing closely the reality of humanity and then translating it to the stage without losing that truth. Mr. Brandreth’s young Will is observant and astute, and his characterization of a budding Shakespeare is a strength of the novel.I enjoyed “The Spy of Venice”, the plot is interesting, and the mystery (though surface) is intriguing, but it did take me longer to read it than I anticipated.

Thank goodness it is short, because when I decided I could not stomach it for more than a few pages at a time, it would have taken more forever to finish otherwise.There is no joy in “The Bell Jar”. No hope. And I have read many books where that is the case. The problem with this book is that there is no point to any of it. No real characterization, no depth.

I think both texts suffer from protagonist problems, and both are products of their time and they did not age well.I could be nice and blame the time of year I read it, in between Thanksgiving and Christmas, for my dislike but that would be a cop out. 200 pages of how one would like to commit suicide.

I can appreciate the skill of the writer. There are flashes of it in this book. Plath was a great poet, but a novelist, no. I think this text is one of those where its “greatness is thrust upon it” by people who wanted it for various agendas. If just standing alone, it does not merit any such claim.

Back then they had comic books with their children’s menu that reflected stories of the sea. One of those comics dealt with the Barbary pirates and America’s Navy. I was entranced, and my love of history was nurtured at an early age. As coincidentally was my love for hush puppies and fried fish. So, when I saw “Thomas Jefferson and the Tripoli Pirates” I picked it up. It is a pop history book, which is fine (I am sure there are much more scholarly texts) but as an overview of the Barbary Pirate Wars it is serviceable, and a nice introduction to anyone who does not know much about this oft overlooked issue from early American history. I like that the text’s main focus is on people (on both sides of the conflict) that a super majority of us have never heard of. The ones that most history books leave out.Like a lot of history, the topics covered in this book have had an after-effect much greater than the initial focus. The Barbary Wars may be a footnote in American history, but it is not minor. “Thomas Jefferson and the Tripoli Pirates” is a lightweight text, there is a lot more I wish it had explored in depth.

This nonfiction text focuses on the US Merchant Marines. Not a branch of the military although the name makes one think that, but the civilian sailing corps that kept the supply lines running. I have read a lot of nonfiction that deals with military history, but never a book that focuses on the most important aspect of any war, the supply line. This statistic brought home the importance of cargo shipping, “Each American solider serving overseas in WW II would need between 7 and 8 tons of supplies.” Author William Geroux derives his title from Mathews County, Virginia, a rural coastal county on the Chesapeake Bay. Mathews County has a proud seafaring tradition, and Geroux uses stories of its citizens who were mariners as the springboard for this text.The stories of the merchant marines are powerful ones, and a lot of the book focuses on the horrible year 1942, a deadly year on the seas for US mariners while the Nazi U-Boat force began an all-out assault on American shipping. “For seven months the U-Boats had had their way in American waters, sinking more than 300 merchant ships and killing thousands of merchant seaman.” One Mathews County man’s recounted memory of his grandmother learning that she had lost a second son at sea in just as many months is heart rending. A big detraction in the text is that the author has a very scattered approach. He does not follow a timeline, but jumps around, and the ever changing sense of time and order can get confusing. If there had been a consistent approach to how the text was presented it would have greatly improved the reading experience.In all “The Mathews Men” gives due to a part of the WW II generation that is oft overlooked, and for that reason alone I am glad I read it. I now have a broader understanding of an important time in my nation’s history, learned a lot about the U-Boat force of Germany, and other aspects of WW II that I knew nothing about. This line from the book sums up the reading experience well, “Men all over Mathews County kept going to sea like they always had. They didn’t do anything different during the war. The torpedoes just got in the way.”...more",Notes are private!,0,36,1,"Nov 11, 2020","Nov 18, 2020","Nov 11, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25982831-the-mathews-men

The now infamous sinking of that ship spawned 5 horrific days floating in the deep waters of the Pacific, leaving only 317 members of the crew of almost 1200 alive at the end of the ordeal.This short text written by survivor Edgar Harrell is clearly not written by a polished writer, and I did not mind that one bit. It also has a very heavy Christian influence, as Mr. Harrell was a believer at the time of the sinking and obviously grew even stronger in his faith as he lived his life. The book was written in 2005. Personally, I found the religious influence in the writing to give the story even more depth and strength, although for others it might not be as enjoyable.The best aspect of the text is that it is a primary source. Mr. Harrell’s tale is at its strongest as he recounts the 5 days floating in the Pacific. There were moments were I felt abject terror as he describes some of the experiences. The details of the rescues are also beautifully relayed, and I was intrigued at what he had to say about the events after the war and the many years it took for the event to gain the proper recognition from the Navy.In short, “Out of the Depths” informed me of things I did not know, inspired me, encouraged my faith, and reminded me of the beautiful power of the human spirit, and ultimately about healing and reconciliation.Ain’t none of that bad....more",Notes are private!,0,35,1,"Oct 26, 2020","Oct 31, 2020","Oct 26, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/26702623-out-of-the-depths

But it is a beautiful book about beautiful things (love, art, friendship, family, life, etc.). This novel celebrates and explicates what is beauty. The aesthetics of the good things in this world. It sounds heady, at times it is, but this text is a thing of exquisiteness.This long novel is the story of Alessandro Giuliani, a Roman, and covers his life in the first half of the 20th century, with most emphasis on his early life and his years in the Italian Army in WW I. Alessandro tells the story of his life to a young man who he finds himself walking with for a few days. The frame story begins and ends with this walk/conversation between Alessandro and this young man (Nicolo).The book, which starts out a little didactically, I found to be engaging and unexpectedly very funny at times. Of great enjoyment to me was the dry humor that the author (Mark Helprin) endows the novel’s protagonist with. Alessandro’s witty retorts and wry observations pop up in the most unexpected, and oddly appropriate, moments.This is a long book, so I’ll share some moments that I liked. There are many to choose from…I greatly enjoyed the chapter “Stella Maris” which boast some grand and profound philosophical and theological musings, powerful for their simplicity and joy in the divine and the ways in which it manifests itself in this world. The melancholy tone of this chapter is ringed with splendor.The above chapter also has a character take down the socialist ideology in one of the best efforts I have seen in fiction or nonfiction. Consider this exchange between two characters-“Since its beginning the world has seen empires, theocracies, slave states, anarchy, feudalism, capitalism, revolutionary states, and everything else you can think of, and no matter what the variation, the bloodstained stakes, guillotines, and killing grounds remain.”“Scientific socialism will make it otherwise.”“Scientific socialism will make the killing scientific and socialistic”, Alessandro replied.“True, it may be necessary initially to liquidate opponents of the revolution”, Ludovico admitted.“Yes, I know. The stakes do come in handy. It’s why no one ever takes them down.”“You commit a great evil” Ludovico declared “By abandoning belief in the perfectibility of man in favor of dreams of the heavenly city and of a God that cannot be proved.”“The heavenly city in which I believe Ludovico, cannot be demonstrated. It is a matter of faith and revelation, not reason. You, however, claim that your heavenly city is demonstrable, and, of course, it isn’t.”Later on in the book Alessandro worries about Italy post WW I, “Alessandro feared that fascists would flirt with the Left, that rather than destroy one another, they would combine…” And sadly, I fear the same today.When I read the following passage my heart soared, as it is one of my passions, seeing people in the past as humans and as products of their time, not ours! “It’s simple. You can do something just, and that is to remember them. Remember them. To think of them in their flesh, not as abstractions. To make no generalizations of war or peace that override their souls. To draw no lessons of history on their behalf. Their history is over. Remember them, just remember them-in their millions-for they were not history, they were only men, women, and children. Recall them, if you can, with affection, and recall them, if you can, with love. That is all you need to do in regard to them, and all they ask.” When you realize that in one generation this applies to you, it should make you a lot less judgmental of those who came before us.Overall this novel is a mix of a good story that has moments of literary beauty and philosophical musings interlaced in a seamless blend. These elements serve each other and create an enchanting whole. In “A Soldier of the Great War” if one of those features was missing the novel would not seem complete, so well do they complement each other.At the novel’s end someone observes about a baby, “All his heart had been in his cry, and then he had had peace.” Sounds like a great way to describe a life to me.This is my first Mark Helprin novel. It will not be my last. His is too great a talent to ignore....more",Notes are private!,0,56,1,"Oct 19, 2020","Nov 10, 2020","Oct 19, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/87985.A_Soldier_of_the_Great_War

This short 100 page book is their conversation over dinner. Don’t roll your eyes at the premise. “Dinner with a Perfect Stranger” (look closely at that title, there is a lot of meaning packed in there) is a lovely and simple lesson on the basic theology of Christianity and a relationship with God. There are moments that are profound elements of Christianity that are very simply observed. Some examples:“I’m saying that God’s desire to forgive doesn’t negate his perfect justice.”“God longs to have you with him. That’s why he created you.”“A new heart gets you in the game. Then you have to let me be your instructor.”I’m a believer, so I know that shaped my reading of the text, but when I took down the critical eye, and looked at it through a wider lens I found that I enjoyed this book.

(3.5 stars) “Neil Simon’s Memoirs” is actually two books, both written by Simon, combined into one volume. Those books, written about 5 years apart are vastly different in style and quality. The first one (“Rewrites”) is far superior to the second (“The Play Goes On”). Together they cover Simon’s life & career up to about the year 2000. Mr. Simon died in 2018. “Rewrites” is a really interesting book, focusing on aspects of Simon’s childhood, his early career, and his marriage to his first wife Joan, which was a very happy one. Her death from cancer concludes the story “Rewrites” tells. “Rewrites” has chuckle moments, some nice insights on life, and some interesting tidbits about Simon’s playwriting career. However… “The Play Goes On”, although not bad, just does not measure up. It feels like a different book (of course it is) and Simon was a bit off his groove. Also, the parts of his life that “The Play Goes On” chronicles are not nearly as enjoyable as the first half of the memoirs, so I assume that is a factor for the lesser satisfaction for me. Neil Simon was a very prolific playwright, and I enjoyed reading his memoirs. They are mostly well written, and with few exceptions, not pretentious, which is an achievement for a memoir.

Neither is a book I would have picked up on my own, I read both because they were picks in my book club. And I liked both, although this one not as much as the first. And yet, if Ng writes another novel I doubt I will read it unless someone picks it for book club. Explain that one!“Little Fires Everywhere” is strongest in its device of an omniscient 3rd person narrator which creates a continual shift of empathy in the reader, as we learn more and more about the motivations and intimacies of the characters. It is the greatest strength of the text, and being in the minds of numerous characters gives unfiltered access to their motivations and so your allegiances and sympathies are constantly being challenged. I liked that, a lot.A particularly strong moment in the novel is in chapter 9, where we get the explanation for a strained relationship between a mother and her youngest daughter. Up to that point in the book I misjudged the motivations for the relationship and the explanation for its constraints is artfully rendered. Abject fear for the safety and well-being of a loved one can create a toxic dynamic. The irony of that is profound.The thing that held me back with “Little Fires Everywhere” is that it feels like a made for TV movie. Really, the plot is a bit contrived. Also hard for me to get past was the character of Mia. I could not shake the feeling that Ng liked her more than the other protagonist, and frankly Mia disgusted me. Every major issue in the text is sparked by Mia. Based on the book’s epigraph I surmise that Ng approves of Mia. I most definitely do not! I understand I am projecting that. It’s my interpretation and I’m allowed!Overall, “Little Fires Everywhere” was a good read. The TV movie plot kept me reading, and the novel did not take up too much of my time, but rather it is just the right length. It reminds us that there is always more to the story than what we know.

I appreciated the fact that this book starts with the particular, the Mott family, and brothers (Bill, Benny, and Barton) and 1 sister serving in the navy during WW II and thru them illuminates the larger aspects of the time. I also appreciated the almost exclusive focus on the Pacific theater of the war, an aspect of WW II that seems to get short shrift in a lot of popular histories.The author, Sally Mott Freeman, is the daughter of one of the above mentioned brothers, and she did one heck of a job finding a myriad of collaborative sources to flesh out the tale. Besides being a good family and war story, “The Jersey Brothers” is also a pretty decent history of some of the pivotal moments in the Pacific war. I recently saw the 2019 film “Midway”, not a bad film by the way, and almost everything in the film (itself a pretty decent history) was touched upon in this book.

The atrocities of the Japanese during WW II can be forgiven, but they should never be forgotten. The deprivations and litany of horrors the POWs held in the Philippines endured, if possible, became even worse in the last year of the war in the Pacific.

I did suspect the ending well before it happened, but oddly enough that enhanced my enjoyment.There were two moments in the text that I really liked. One is a lovely comment about faith (page 57). Not necessarily religious faith, but the act of faith itself. “And if I give in to it, as an act of faith, it leads me somewhere unexpected, not where I intended, but somewhere intensely alive, glorious-and the result is independent of me, with a life force of its own.” The other was on page 101, dealing with love, “About love. About how often we mistake love for fireworks-for drama and dysfunction. But real love is very quiet, very still.”“The Silent Patient” has a clever premise, and is a perfect read for the beach or a crisp fall day. I took the book on its terms, and I enjoyed it.

How many absurdly awful things can happen to one person in a lifetime? Everything and the kitchen sink comes at one of the novel’s main characters, Jude St. Francis. (Sounds like a character’s name on a soap opera). All of the things that happen are awful circumstances that happen to many people all across the world, but dumping them all on one person turns what could have been an interesting novel into a ridiculousness of tragedies.  By the last 300 pages I wanted it done. If I had not already invested 500 pages in it I would have set it down. Why did I even get 500 pages in you ask? Good question. The reason is because there are moments in this text that are stunningly accurate in their descriptions of human relationships, especially those that are not conventional. Can people have a romantic relationship that is erotic, filled with love, and also not sexual? Yes they can. I know this. And Hanya Yanagihara is the first author I have read who captures the nuances of it. She writes at times with such an understanding of the human heart and mind that I could put up with the story she used as a vehicle to discuss those elements. Also well done in the book are some thoughts on friendship and loneliness. Concerning both areas the author touches on the ugliness and beauty that are inherent in both of these aspects of life. A few moments I especially liked in the book were… (page #s for the paperback edition)Page 590- a section that focused on a character naively hoping that the current set up of a relationship that he dearly valued would sustain itself without changing. I know that feeling, I lived that hopeful naiveté, and it is captured nicely here. Pages 641-645- the text focuses on a friendship that is more than a friendship, and yet not a complete marriage. Its sentiments are true for a lot of people and I have rarely seen it addressed in literature because it is not the poetry of romance, it is the gritty (and I think beautiful) reality of a relationship, parts of which are quite fulfilling, and some which is lacking. The fact that it is between two longtime friends of the same gender who don’t identify as homosexual also gives it a poignancy that I don’t often see.This line on page 765 is just brilliant with its power, “The forgettable, in-between moments in which nothing seemed to be happening but whose absence was singularly unfillable” is one of the best lines I have read about the real essence of a long term relationship/friendship.So after those praises, why does this novel ultimately fail? A big reason is the protagonist Jude St. Francis. I really disliked the character of Jude. When I would start to sympathize with him he would do something so utterly unlikable that my sympathy did not cover my antipathy. I don’t know if Yanagihara meant us to have such mixed feelings about him or not. It’s really not relevant. I did not like him. Jude fights EVERY attempt to help and love him, and he gets more chances for acceptance than most people get in a lifetime. He is literally surrounded by good things and good people (after a traumatic awful childhood) and he is incapable of working towards accepting and moving past his past. Not minimizing the long term effects of childhood trauma, but Jude is nothing but horrible to those that care about him. And that is the problem. Why do these people in Jude’s life, all of them, hang on so? There are no qualities in his character, or actions that he takes that make that believable. For example, Jude (who suffers from chronic health problems) sues a person, even after being told that his lawsuit will negatively hurt a child who has chronic health problems. And Jude’s stated reason for the lawsuit is pure revenge. It does not matter what happened to you, this action makes you a bad person. Part 6 “Dear Comrade” needed heavy editing, and is just not good. It veers wildly in quality. There are some awful moments in this section of the text.This is a long . I guess I had to exercise some demons from “A Little Life”. There are some excellent quality moments in this novel, but too few for a book of 800 plus pages.

This installment finds our favorite history buff serial killer trying to take a tour of back country Florida in the spirit of “Easy Rider”. Author Tim Dorsey creates some really awesome moments in this text, including the invention of the small speed trap town- Wobbley, Florida. Its denizens and small time crook leaders and their intention to “keep it that way” are one of my favorite aspects of the book. I also especially enjoyed a parody of a legislative hearing in chapter 29. It is pure bliss, and spot on!One of the things I like about these books are that sometimes in the midst of the zaniness a character will say something that is utterly profound. In this text, Serge says at one point, “You can only judge through the context of the times.” If the idiots running around today who think we have reached the epitome of human civilization and empathy would recognize the truth in that statement there would be a lot less fools running around acting like everything in the past is contemptible and human folly. Oh well, as this series has also said, the stupid and rude are “part of the human condition too.” At one point in “Coconut Cowboy” Serge says, “But after freaking people out, I grow on them.” That just might be the perfect way to sum up this series.

I enjoyed the parts of the book most that did not involve Bryson’s attempt at the Trail, which I doubt was his intention.I think one of my issues with “A Walk in the Woods” is that Bill Bryson is too snarky and derisive of some of the people he encounters a little too much for my tastes.

Short chapters and truncated thoughts and paragraphs are utilized to give a brief overview of 3 generations of a black Brooklyn family. There is not a lot of depth to this novel; it comes across to me as a snapshot in a moment of time, underlying the point that one never really knows the story behind a picture. I don’t know if this is a great book, but there are undeniably moments of beauty in this text.The novel alternates between the first person points of views of Sabe and Sammy Simmons (the (grand) parents) their daughter Iris, and Aubrey (the man who got her pregnant at 16) and the result of that pregnancy- Melody. The alternating views add a nice dimension to the novel, allowing the reader to see many generational perspectives, and noticing how the perspective alters their opinions on what is happening. I loved the chapters in this book told from Sabe and Sammy’s POV. Specifically chapters 7 & 8 in this text are just lovely, filled with beautiful moments and language and simple observations (some of which got me a little teary) that life can engender in those who have lived a while. In one of the Sabe focused chapters there is a well-done meditation on memory and how it shapes us. Lines like, “Age will do that to you. Soon as something starts coming to your mind, it snatches it back. Makes you forget the stuff you want to remember. Brings back the memories you’re trying to forget.” And this gem, which I think it just brilliant with its conciseness, “Something about memory. It takes you back to where you were and lets you just be there for a time.”“Red at the Bone” is an interesting novel. A nice experiment of a family saga that is concise, perhaps too surface, but still tells a story about our humanity. At one point Sammy muses “Guess that’s where the tears come from, knowing that there’s so much in this big world that you don’t have a single ounce of control over.” This character of great faith just touched my heart; I enjoyed “Red at the Bone” for that alone....more",Notes are private!,0,46,1,"Jul 20, 2020","Jul 22, 2020","Jul 20, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43697186-red-at-the-bone

It is a much more in depth, and interesting, story than most people know. A main thesis of the book is that Hamilton shaped the manner in which we live under the Constitution, and also the shape and form of many of our modern governmental institutions and practices, more than any other founding father. Chernow makes it difficult to argue that point.This biography also reinforced the point that is made for me any time I read a book about the past, “there is nothing new under the sun”. No one who bemoans the current situation (political, moral, etc.) knows anything about past ones or they would put everything in its proper context and be a whole lot less ridiculous in their assumptions. I mean, for goodness sake the original Deep State was Thomas Jefferson, the FIRST Secretary of State who was undermining his boss, and trying to manipulate the country to his designs, and not George Washington’s. Ain’t none of it new…which I take reassurance from. I kept having a nagging thought while reading this book. At times, I wished David McCullough had written it. Ron Chernow gave me the history with this text, but David McCullough tells you the story. Still, I will read other books of Chernow's, mainly because he has written about some topics that I would love to know more about.

Storms series. I have read thru the series in order, and they are hit and miss, as any series of that length would be. “Tiger Shrimp Tango” finds our favorite psychopath going after con artists who are running various frauds in Florida, this time with the help of his former nemesis, stuck in time film noir detective Agent Mahoney.Mahoney is a character in the series who is one note, but I enjoy the note. The riff on film noir patter is clever and yields lines like, “The day began like any other, except it was Tuesday, not the other six.” And, “Most of them just stink up my oxygen with alibis that are as shaky as an analogy that doesn’t fit.”As my Goodreads friend Melki said of this series in an exchange we had, “Serge is one of the most quotable imaginary psychopaths roaming the pages of modern literature.” I could not have said it better. I could list dozens of funny (and often accurate) comments Serge makes that are applicable to so much. For a murderer (of people who “deserve it”) he says many things that are spot on. At one point Serge goes off on barbers brushing you off at the end of a haircut, and how deceitful and pointless that exercise is if the aim is to actually remove bits of hair. Boy do I know the itchy truth of that sentiment!I generally read this series sitting in the hot sun on a beach. I have found when I read it in those circumstances I enjoy it more, and its deficiencies don’t matter as much. There are funny moments in this book, but I was not all that engaged with it. The weakness of Dorsey’s ability to write descriptive narrative is glaring in this text. The characters too often say things like, “Why is that melting” or “look at that such and such” instead of the author creating a moment. Too much telling in this book, not enough showing. This is especially evident in almost every conversation depicted in the novel between Serge and his perpetually stoned sidekick Coleman.But, having said that, I have read 17 of the books, and 3 more are on my pile for a beach trip in August, so Mr. Dorsey gets the last laugh!As Serge says in “Tiger Shrimp Tango”, “We need to stop taking ourselves so seriously.”...more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,"Jul 06, 2020","Jul 20, 2020","Jul 06, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18072897-tiger-shrimp-tango

Mark Obmascik (the author) uses the true story of an American educated Japanese surgeon, and the American soldier who killed him (and found a battle diary the surgeon kept in the process) as a jumping off point to give a brief overview of the war in the Pacific and the Aleutian campaign in particular.The stories of Paul Tatsuguchi and Dick Laird are nicely interwoven with this history to give the war a human dimension. I appreciated the fact that Obmascik did not focus exclusively on them, but wove their tales into the larger contact of the war in the Pacific.The part of the text that depicts the Battle of Attu is scattered. The writer jumps around a lot. I can’t say that that is a bad thing. It is just something I noticed, and I am not sure it enhances the book.Overall, “The Storm on Our Shores” feels slight. The author is a journalist, so I guess that surface examination might be a residual effect.

Often times he would do this in the same sentence. It is a skill that only the best satirists possess. “Galápagos” is a novel tinged with darkness, but not the bitterness that would envelop Vonnegut later in his life/career. In “Galápagos” I really like the unique idea of modern (in this novel the late 20th century) humanity’s brains being “too big” and thus a bad thing. It is an intriguing motif, which Vonnegut weaves the book around. The book takes place a million years in the future from 1986 AD and humans have “evolved’ into a sort of aquatic creature that only operates on the basic and necessary instincts of life. Get it? The irony of “evolving” into a lesser species? It is intriguing. I am not sure the novel makes a case for its being the entire focus of a book. Many of the usual suspects one assumes would be in a Vonnegut novel are addressed in this tale, and he makes a biting connection between sex and warfare that is a nice touch. It is satirical, and yet perfectly apropos at the same time.I will admit that I am still a little perplexed at the purpose of the use of a narrator who is a ghost, a Vietnam vet and the son of Vonnegut’s eponymous character Kilgore Trout. I don’t know that it detracts from the novel; I just don’t see the point?Like most Vonnegut, “Galápagos” is about what it is that makes us human. Among those items: having the capacity to reason, to be motivated by selfish desires over the greater good, to laugh at farts…these are traits of most people. And Vonnegut is not saying that is a bad thing, he is just saying “The thing was…”“Galápagos” makes me feel irritation and great love (at the same time) for those things about us that make us so wonderfully human.*I am sure that when I reread this book I will have some very different opinions.

Unfortunately too often Mr. Greenblatt allowed this text to descend into so“Tyrants are enemies of the future.”“Tyrant” could have been a great book. Unfortunately too often Mr. Greenblatt allowed this text to descend into something it never should have been, a thinly veiled justification of his political views thru the study of Shakespeare. First, my issues with this book. The first part of the chapter “Enablers” is a cheap shot at Greenblatt’s political foes. He makes a lot of unsupported (textually) leaps and bounds to connect the psychology of Richard III to Donald Trump. All while never mentioning Trump’s name, which seems even more disingenuous to me. Because he can’t rise above his ideology (some of his points are valid, and some are egregious) in the service of a great premise, Greenblatt makes that time honored mistake of telling us what Shakespeare thought about certain things. The danger of this is that you are guessing, projecting, and invariably contradicting yourself. Greenblatt does, often. One example, towards the end of the book (page 186) is when he talks about Shakespeare’s views on political parties. Earlier in the book, he acknowledges that political parties (based on ideology) would have been an alien concept to Shakespeare. It is just a lame attempt to foist his beliefs on Shakespeare in that moment to give credence to his argument on that page. He also extols the virtues of dissent and claims that Shakespeare believed highly in the value of people’s “refusal to march in lockstep to any one person’s orders.” However, one gets the impression (based on this book) that he only finds dissent that he agrees with virtuous. Which makes Greenblatt wonderfully human…if he acknowledges that hypocrisy in himself. I know I struggle with that open mindedness, as does everyone.Now, as to why I enjoyed reading the book…Greenblatt is a good writer and he has an excellent idea for this text, and he gives interesting analysis of Shakespeare’s depiction of tyranny, in many forms. He makes a stunningly astute (and lovely) point about a small moment in “King Lear” that I had never considered, and has changed my entire outlook on a play I have read many times. “Madness in Great Ones” is an excellent chapter on “King Lear” and “The Winter’s Tale”. Greenblatt offers some very interesting insights into those texts. I also enjoyed some of the analysis of “Richard III”, a text ripe for discussion! I do think a knowledge of the following Shakespeare plays enhances the text for the reader: “King Lear”, “The Winter’s Tale”, “Richard III”, “Julius Caesar”, “Coriolanus”, & “Macbeth”. Greenblatt does a nice job of summarizing relevant plot points with his analysis, but knowing the plays adds dimension to the reader’s experience.I guess I am disappointed in Greenblatt. Dude, just write a critical examination of tyranny as depicted in Shakespeare, and trust the reader to make connections. Or at least examine real tyrants, not some loud mouth oaf. There are plenty to choose from, in history and in the modern day. North Korea, Syria, Venezuela, China are tyrannies today. Heck, as I type this  Putin has been “re-elected” to serve as leader of Russia until 2036! Any half-wit reader of Shakespeare can appreciate his modern relevance. Examine that, look into its layers, but don’t forsake real depth, intellectual honesty, and a wonderful topic for political theatrics.

The author builds on the characteristics from the first novel in this series (“Dissolution”) in a manner that adds shades of depth to Lawyer Shardlake. As in the first book in this series, C.J. Sansom invents and then fits a fictional scenario into real historical events in a manner that makes sense, and does not change the conclusions of history. I enjoy that aspect of this series a lot. In this novel, the story intersects with the downfall of Henry VIII’s Chief Minister Thomas Cromwell.This book also introduces a new sidekick for Shardlake, an enforcer of sorts Joseph Barak.

The texts do a nice job of mixing historical elements, an intriguing mystery, and thought provoking characters and situations in a pleasing manner. This story sees the protagonist struggling with his faith, as this former reformer sees more and more in the protestant reforms happening at that time that he struggles with. Sansom has not taken the easy way out with this, Shardlake wants faith, has had faith, and does not know what to do with it. At one point a character muses, “Man is an angry, savage being. Sometimes faith becomes an excuse for battle. It is no real faith then. In justifying their positions in the name of God, men silence God.” That is not shallow stuff.

The novel cast a spell so strong, that when the jarring reality of life springs up at the conclusion you can’t help but be a little disoriented. This is a novel that has been on my radar for years, but I am just now picking it up. This story, told by an omniscient narrator, follows a hostage situation in the vice presidential palace of an unnamed South American country. The hostages include a world famous opera soprano, and many business and political leaders from various countries. The point of view also considers the guerrillas who take the hostages. I have never read an Ann Patchett novel before. I will pick her up again! She has a simplicity and lovely finesse with language. I was caught up in the story, but also in the words she used to weave it. With a precise prose that brimmed with clarity Patchett created characters that, even if only a few lines of the text were devoted to them, came across as real people. I feel like opera gets a lot of negative attention from readers of this text. And opera is important to many of the characters in the book. However, I feel the bigger point is what opera represents to many of the characters in the text. It is a source of life and inspiration.

But then, who doesn’t?”“Hag-Seed” is the fourth book I have read in the Hogarth series. The Hogarth project sees “Shakespeare’s works retold by bestselling novelists of today.” This text sees Margaret Atwood taking a stab at “The Tempest”. Atwood has chosen to write a very flimsy novel around her theories of that play. I wish she had just written an essay about some ideas and critical approaches she has about the play itself and possible staging of it. It would have been much more interesting without the crap story attached.Shakespeare’s “The Tempest” is thematically deep. You could read that play a dozen times and make new discoveries with each reading. I have! “Hag-Seed” is so shallow and juvenile that I am doubtful you would find a single intriguing thing to ponder while reading it.At least the writing does not stink.

I kinda hate myself now. “Ohio” sounded interesting to me the moment it came on my radar. However, it was highly recommended by NPR’s er, and EVERY time I read a book they recommend I don’t like it. When will I learn...NPR does not know books.The “Prelude” to “Ohio” is good. A little too ""I have an MFA in writing"", but still the writing is tight, the setup is well done, and it gave me high hopes. But then the rest of the novel follows. If it had not been a book club selection my 2020 resolution to not finish books that I don’t enjoy would have found its first taker. The premise of “Ohio” is that four people (who are loosely connected and close in age) return to their hometown in Ohio on the same night, and the intersection of their reasons for doing so. Their four alternating perspectives are the focus of the novel, taking place over the course of one evening.My issues with the text-The author (Stephen Markley) goes out of his way to be “authentic” by mentioning tons of Ohio minutia that only someone from eastern Ohio (I am) would know. In fact, I was born in the same town Mr. Markley was raised in. Moreover, the minutia comes across as too cute by half and feels ridiculously inauthentic. Mentioning a bunch of things is not the same as capturing the atmosphere. There are numerous flashbacks to high school in the text, and the dialogue of the teenaged characters is complete nonsense. They do not talk and think like teenagers. Not a word of it rings true. They are also quite experienced sexually. Like I am 41 and I learned a thing or too. Again, utter nonsense. And the text focuses negatively on the female characters. They are nasty mean girls with the knowledge of the most vigorously trained courtesans. Juvenile stuff Mr. Author!The book is gratuitously vulgar. I can deal with that, if you make a point for it. “Ohio” doesn’t.One of the four perspectives we receive is of a character named Bill Ashcraft. I loathed this individual. He is everything that disgusts me in the world. I don’t blame the author for that. He is allowed to create characters I don’t like. It is just another reason I did not enjoy the book. Of the four perspectives we receive, only one of them, a quiet vet named Dan Eaton is a person I would want to have any association with in real life.Finally, the novel’s “Coda” is pure privileged elitist fantasy, imagining social problems that are just not there, or not nearly as “dire” as he appears to want them to be. He has the media shilling for white supremacy groups (which he seems to think falls from the buckeye trees) and refusing to call an attack on a mosque terrorism. Seriously? That is not even a remotely truthful depiction. Puh leez!Yet, there is some skill in Markley’s talent, an occasional well rendered phrase or idea. I really vacillated between hating and being impressed (at times) with this text. **I have amended this  since my book club meeting. They gave me even more reasons to dislike the text.“Ohio” is a self-important book. Truly pompous in its view of itself.

I am not sure what that means. This novel has as its protagonists two detectives who were secondary characters in the first book in the series, and I think that change of focus is part of the reason that I was more caught up in it. Detectives Magozzi and Rolseth are fun characters, who play well off each other.The premise is clever and even though I figured out mostly what was happening by page 218 of a 340-page book, the premise was craftily enough presented that I enjoyed continuing to read seeing how what I had figured out was brought together. One would suspect that in a mystery/thriller figuring out the conclusion would ruin it, but in this case it didn’t. As one character says, “They’re connected, all right. I just can’t imagine how.”One thing I really enjoyed about this book and its predecessor is that there are moments of emotion (unexpectedly well rendered) in each text. In addition, occasionally a line/moment that makes you stop for a bit. Lines like, “…thinking briefly of all the history that makes up a man, that you never knew everything about anybody, and that there were monsters everywhere” make you take pause.“Live Bait” is a quick and engaging read.

This 800-page novel is mainly from the point of view of Patsy Carpenter, a young Texan woman of education and moderate wealth. Occasionally McMurtry shifts the POV to another character, and I enjoyed the fact that in this long novel the focus shifts when it needs to. It speaks highly of the author’s skill.“Moving On” is a novel about a relationship. Frustration grips the reader as we watch two people (whose feelings for each other I am still unsure about) as they make life more difficult because of an unwillingness to communicate honestly with each other. The marriage of Jim and Patsy Carpenter is rendered in an artful and interesting manner. McMurtry portrays (without prejudice, another stunning feat) some of the ugliness that a long-term relationship automatically engenders without negating the importance of such relationships. It does not sound like fun reading but I was consistently engaged throughout this book.Lines like these below will resonate with any reader who has been in a committed long-term relationship, and fought for it. Some last, some do not. I recognized a lot of moments in this book. Some of them I did not want to admit I knew.* “I want what I want, by god, and I don’t think it’s fair that I should want any less.”* “When disappointment first began to dawn she tried to hide it from herself.

Elton John is a pill. He admits he is a pill, but in a manner that at times feels insincere despite his self-deprecating humor. There is incredible ego present (the text abounds with petty recounting of statistics that ego demands). However, Elton has been very famous since his early 20s. It is understandable.I really enjoyed the parts of “Me” that focused on Elton’s music, Bernie Taupin, and his albums. I could have taken even more of that. Big praise to John for devoting substantial space in his autobiography to other musicians, especially those who influenced him. People that many folks probably don’t know, like Long John Baldry (I was thrilled to see him mentioned on the first page), Leon Russel, David Ackles, and others. I appreciated that, as many folks who pick up this book might not have heard of them and their music. In fact, if there had been more focus on those aspects of his life, and a little less name-dropping I would not have complained. But, to be fair, those “big” names and experiences have been part of his life too.All in all, I’m an Elton John fan and I enjoyed his autobiography. It is an engaging read and I think for the most part it seems truthful. An unexpected pleasure is that the closing pages of “Me” were also quite touching.

A production I loved.Lee Hall adapted the stage script of “Shakespeare in Love” from the brilliant screenplay by Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard, and Hall did a nice job of it. Taking what he could from the screenplay; adapting, cutting, augmenting, and adding to it as needed to make this story work on stage is not an easy task, but one I think he handled successfully. I do feel that the play assumes a lot of the audience, where the film did a little better job of filling in gaps that the general moviegoer might have had in knowledge. The play is for a smaller more select group, it reflects that.I really enjoyed the many clever allusions to Shakespeare’s work scattered throughout the text. This was a hallmark of the film as well, but some really clever bits have been added to the stage play. A criticism of the text, its characterizations are pretty surface on the page. Good performers have to add a lot of flesh to them.When it comes down to it, “Shakespeare in Love” is a love letter to the theater and to Shakespeare, so it would have to be pretty awful for me not to enjoy it.

While reading this book I was reminded of emotions and feelings from moments in my life that I had forgotten I felt.“Breathing Lessons” takes place over a single day and is broken into three parts, each part told from the first person perspective of one half of married couple, Maggie and Ira Moran.Tyler captures better than anyone the exasperation and irritability that we can only feel for someone we are very comfortable with, and who we love very much. And she uses that in this beautiful work to remind us (without a single grand “romantic” gesture) why we need someone along with us for this ride we call life.Ms. Tyler also captures the hysterically funny in everyday life. It is not knee slapping humor, it is real humor.

I have noticed calling out of Europe pops up in a couple of his book thus far. This book was published in 2011 and Silva also takes obvious swipes at President Obama’s foreign policy, which was decidedly limp wristed during his first term. A character says, “There was a time when novelists wrote narrative, and journalists were content to report facts. And the facts are quite simple. There exists in the world today an organized force that seeks to weaken, or even destroy the West through acts of indiscriminate violence. This force is a part of a broader radical movement to impose sharia law and restore the Islamic Caliphate. And no amount of wishful thinking will make it go away.” Silva, through his characters, finds such people perhaps well intentioned, but ultimately foolish. The author does give the president a redemptive moment in the text however, when behind the scenes he makes a decision that does lead to terrorist threats being diminished. I should say that Silva never mentions the politicians in his books by name, they are not characters per se. At least he didn’t with Presidents Bush and Obama or the other foreign leaders who make appearances in his texts. These fictional tales he weaves are set in and amongst real life events of the early 21st century, but they are also somewhat apart from them.Elements of the text I really enjoyed:I enjoy how Silva incorporates the high dollar art world in this series, and in this novel and its predecessor particularly. I appreciate how evenhanded the Allon series is. Silva does not whitewash over the sins of the West or of Israel. What he does not do is excuse murderous action towards innocents, regardless of who is perpetrating it.“Portrait of a Spy” also has a character from Saudi Arabia, named Nadia that I just fell in love with.

The greatest success of this long play is the interaction between the reader/viewer and the title character. Richard is a horrid human being, but we are reading or watching the play because we are entranced by him and his villainy. It is a sobering thought, one that should horrify us, but we can't help ourselves. We are drawn to the bastard! I imagine Shakespeare loved his version of Richard because he endows him with such gleeful wit and debauched enjoyment in creating pain for others, that you are seduced by this worst of human beings. It almost borders on melodrama, but it never quite sinks to that level. The role of Richard III is Shakespeare's second longest, after Hamlet, and yet Richard is very rarely dull. Reading Act III where he and his henchman the Duke of Buckingham manipulate other into supporting Richard's claim to the crown will bring a rueful smile to your face.I also enjoy the trio of queens in the play: Margaret the Lancastrian widow of Henry VI (who Richard killed), the Duchess of York (Richard's mom), and his brother's widow Queen Elizabeth. All three hate Richard with an intense passion, and all have blistering scenes of rage towards Richard at various times in the text. Detracting from the play is that these scenes and curses do get redundant, but there is no denying the ferocity and bile Shakespeare gave these women, and in the hands of talented actresses they would be a joy to watch.Many academics criticize ""Richard III"", for various reasons. I find most of them foolish. This play is not meant to be a historical recreation of the actual events (it isn't) nor is it some great lofty text. It is a glimpse into evil and ambition. Really it is just a more modern version of a morality play. Richard represents Vice and Ambition, and like most who let those traits govern their lives, he suffers the consequences.The new RSC Modern Library editions of the plays of Shakespeare are a quality trade paperback edition of the works of the Bard. “Richard III” contains an Introduction by Jonathan Bate. It has a nice focus on Ricard as an influence on the work of Marlowe, and also as an actor, creating his own role. This edition includes an essay on the performance history of the piece, and interviews with a director and designer as well as an interview with actor Simon Russell Beale who gives some awesome perspective and insight into the character of Richard. The Modern Library edition also includes a scene-by-scene analysis, which can help point out an image or symbol you might have missed. The edition also includes a nice “Further Readings” list specifically for this play.Frankly, all of the extra essays allow you to dive into the world of the play, and it is all included in one text.The RSC Modern Library editions are a good addition to the editions of Shakespeare out there. ...more",Notes are private!,0,35,1,"Apr 03, 2020","Apr 07, 2020","Apr 03, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2363679.Richard_III

The reason is because initially it reminded me (in terms of plot points) of “The Name of the Rose”, a novel I detest! As a result I was leery of it for the first 100 pages, or so. But then I got over it, realized it was not going to follow the path of that hated book, and I got into it. I really enjoyed it from that point on. The plot of “Dissolution” is a great set up. A king’s commissioner has been murdered in a monastery, just as the dissolution of the monasteries is coming into full swing during the reign of Henry VIII. The plot also links to the execution of Anne Boleyn in a clever, and believable, manner. Author C.J. Sansom has created in Matthew Shardlake an interesting character. A hunchback lawyer, who is a bit of an anti-hero. A good guy who can be petty and jealous (especially in affairs of the heart). A man guided by logic who is occasionally duped by emotion. It is a well-rounded characterization. As one character says, “Uncovering complicated truths is never easy.”, and in “Dissolution” Mr. Sansom makes such uncovering an enjoyable experience. I will continue on with reading the series.Side note; reading this during the pandemic of 2020 I had to snap my head back a little when I read this line about the plague-“The whole world was stricken then, as it fell a further step towards its close.”...more",Notes are private!,0,58,1,"Mar 25, 2020","Mar 29, 2020","Mar 25, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/630981.Dissolution

This Billy is little more than a child. Literally, a very young man (really a teenager) who is massively insecure, not mentally developed, and possibly manic depressive. I have no idea if any of it is rooted in fact, I don’t care, because it works. Our narrator in this novel is Ben Sippy, a wealthy Philadelphia socialite and writer of dime novels who heads West to escape a disillusioned home life. Through sheer accident he stumbles into the life of Billy Bone, and is with him till the inevitable end that all outlaws must face. McMurtry seems to have written the book as a send up of the dime novels of yore, action driven and very short chapters. That is not to say it is badly written. It is not. McMurtry’s blunt prose, no elaborate poetry here, just well rendered details, moves the text along. Having read three of McMurtry’s novels now I am continually amazed at his ability to create full characters with such sparse language. Also, of note is the novel’s stunning closing image.

After finishing it, I am not sure how the text is organized. It seems like if Mr. Plummer remembered something he wished to share, he did, and in a mostly chronological order.The book is pompous, but Plummer admits that he is pompous. He is obviously a very well read man, tons of allusions throughout the text. Sometimes it gets a little grating. I also don’t think he is a very good fellow. At least there is not much in what he presents of his life that impressed me all that much.Mr. Plummer is a creature of the theatre, which I greatly admire about him. He focuses a lot on that in this memoir, although it is the part of his career that most people will know the least about. Good on him! He is also unabashedly profuse in his praise of others. Really the memoir is just a recounting of his experience of other people. And by and large he is a fan of them. It is very generous in that regard.The text’s final chapter takes on the theater and its importance in our lives, the nature of memory and aging, literature, and mortality. It is actually quite brilliantly written, and above all, very lovely and a fitting conclusion. I have to share this statement Mr. Plummer made towards the end of his memoir that I enjoyed, “A painted moon can tell more stories than a real one and I swear that when all the effects and robots and holograms have been exhausted, and we poor thespians have been replaced by clones and digitized out of existence, there will still be an empty stage somewhere waiting for someone to make an entrance in order to satisfy human nature’s insatiable need to work it’s imaginary forces.”“In Spite of Myself” reads like it comes from another time and place, and I guess in a way it does.

The text moves along smoothly. It is an observational novel, with a tinge of melancholy hanging about it. And really isn’t that a bit like everyday life? Taking in the things around us, and living in that area between joy and sorrow.The protagonist is a 40-year-old botanist named May Attaway. She was an English major in undergrad, as was I, and I loved the references this aspect of her character allows the author to use. Some were insanely specific, and every time I caught one it made me smile in recognition.At one point the protagonist says, “I suppose what you are reading is my attempt to settle. There’s a story I’ve been trying to tell, one about friendship and friends and what place they have in a life, and one I’ve been trying not to tell about my family. Does that make me an unreliable narrator? To a certain extent, aren’t we all?” And folks that is the novel in a nutshell. The author, Jessica Francis Kane, wonderfully fulfills the execution of this task.I had a library copy of the text, and had to fight the urge to annotate all over the place. Here are some moments in the book that I thought were worth remembering.“Midway through my fortieth year, I reached a point where the balance of the past and all it contained seemed to outweigh the future, my mind so full of things said and not said, done and undone, I no longer understood how to move forward.”“I have always assumed others have more and better friends.”“I registered these events the way one would a cold snap; strange but refreshing.”“Halfway through life, I was not sure what I’d made.”“The solitude has a way of loosening memories, and when they start to unfurl I’m at risk of being blown off course.”“People rarely like to be reminded of what they once thought.”“…maybe I don’t understand the pleasure of compromise when you’re in love.”“Because certain things only come into focus when a person is gone. It’s sad, but true. You need memory and loss to polish your thoughts.”“I do believe in the power of words and stories to make sense of things.”“If nostalgia is the recovery of something lost, but with a difference, I’m likely to be swamped by it.”“Rules for Visiting” was a novel that captured me, and made me think on the mundane that makes life lovely. I appreciate it for that. Its conclusions could just as well be my own… “I have very few friends and not one of them is replaceable.

I was interested in 2 of the 3 focuses, so I’ll take it.Occasionally the author tries to wax a little poetic and the prose is just overstuffed, and not good.

Growing up a history buff I had known a lot about Andrew Jackson, but had largely ignored him after my teenage years. That 2016 visit, and the realization that it reminded me of-that there is indeed “nothing new under the sun”, rekindled my interest. As I read the book, as when I was at the Hermitage, the parallels to modern times are many. That is always the case with the past. It is interesting that President Trump had a portrait of Andrew Jackson installed in the Oval Office. I could quote many things the one said that many would easily attribute to the other. They are similar in many aspects, as are the reactions to their presidencies. Both were the end of the world, according to some of their peers, and both seem to have some real strengths and some real weaknesses as people and leaders. I had to grimace as I read about the issue of Indian removal during Jackson’s time. It was an issue he was for, and there were many voracious opponents to it, many of them who had been ardent supporters…until it was Jackson’s policy. Then they were against it. Change the issue from Indian removal to border wall, same deal. I am not commenting on either policy, only on the fact that political foes changed views on it when it made good opposition.As previously mentioned, there is nothing new under the sun. Politically motivated impeachment, arguments about separation of church and state and the role of religion in the body politic, issues of race being used as political cudgels, monetary policy and tariffs, populism vs. the political establishment. It could be today, except it is the years before and just after 1830. It is why I refuse to get bent out of shape about much. Ain’t none of it really new.The text focuses mainly on the years of Jackson’s two terms, and there was quite a bit that I knew only on the surface level, or not at all. Jackson’s ugliness and bad polices get a lot of attention, Indian removal, etc. But there was more to the man, there always is, and his Nullification Proclamation is a great piece of American presidential history I knew little about. Delivered on Dec. 10th 1832, it was Jackson’s ardent defense of the Union and of a federal government and its appropriate powers. It affected every major administration that followed it, and it was brilliant. Jon Meacham (the author) says of Jackson, “He was rather, the great politician of his time, if success in politics is measured by the affirmation of a majority of the people in real time, and by the shadow one casts after leaving the stage.”I love history, but there were times I was not fully engaged with this text. The problem is not the subject matter. Andrew Jackson is a good story. It was the writing and presentation, something did not click for me. At times Mr. Meacham seems a little too fan boyish. I am not sure if the text is too uncritical? He does not absolve Jackson of his sins and contradictions, I just wish he had looked at them a little more. They are worth examining. Andrew Jackson was an important American figure. I appreciate any effort to see him in the context of his time, and I do feel that “American Lion” tries to accomplish that. I am glad I read it.I leave off with something that Jackson said that I think is indicative of many great leaders, past and present- “Always take all the time to reflect that circumstances permit, but when the time for action has come, stop thinking.”...more",Notes are private!,0,52,1,"Feb 11, 2020","Feb 22, 2020","Feb 11, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6409343-american-lion

I only read it again because it was a selection for my book club. With this reread, I found the book to be worse than I remembered it, but I enjoyed the read a little more. I believe this was because I knew going in, it was not all that great.First off, if you are not a fan of Shakespeare, and have read at least his major works I am not sure that this book won’t annoy you…a lot. It annoyed me at times, and I love Shakespeare and have read all of him. The author, M.L. Rio, admits in her “Author’s Notes that the way her characters speak is pretentious. She gained points with me for admitting it!IF WE WERE VILLIANS is divided into five Acts, to mimic the modern division of Shakespeare’s plays. Mostly it is fine, as the novel follows a group of senior theater students in a conservatory program. They are competitive, but close, and of course, a death/murder happens along. The book fluctuates between moments that are insightfully written and other moments where it is a poorly executed potboiler of a text. Act III in the novel is an example of the latter. That act has weak plot lines that border on ridiculous.One thing I was greatly irritated by was a device used twice in the book where the students are assigned anonymous roles in a Shakespeare play and then performed it with no rehearsal in a found space. It is stupidly unrealistic. My training days just don’t allow such false scenarios to go by unnoticed. There are many instances where the completely absurd (and false) moments depicting theatrical training are beyond the pale.One of the better beats in the book is in the prologue of Act V where the protagonist tries to articulate the experience of a friendship that is much more than friendship, but not sexual.

He turns grief and triumph and rapture and rage into words, into something we can understand. He renders the whole mystery of humanity comprehensible.”•	“Anything can feel like punishment if it is taught poorly.”•	“How tremendous the agony of unmade decisions.”Overall, I think IF WE WERE VILLIANS is for a limited audience.

Is not that strange?”""Much Ado About Nothing"" is one of Shakespeare's perennial crowd-pleasers and pops up in performance all the time in classical theatre companies. The reason is simple; it is a fun and witty play. It has some of the best verbal wordplay in all of Shakespeare, and it boasts the only middle aged lovers in all of the Bard's work, the lovely Beatrice and Benedick. This pair of former lovers bicker and snipe at each other with such intensity that the physical and emotional attraction is blatantly obvious from their first moment together on the page / stage. The text alludes to the fact that these two have a past, and there is some hurt there. But Shakespeare allows them to navigate past that, and we get to see it.One of the reasons that I keep returning to ""Much Ado"" is because of how deftly Shakespeare handles the leading characters' pride and reluctance to take the dangerous leap into love. It especially resonates in our time when more and more middle aged people find themselves divorced and single. How does one take that risk again, often under the same emotional circumstances as Beatrice and Benedick? When these two finally put aside their pride and open up to each other, it is as touching and lovely a moment as any in Shakespeare.Once again, as with so many of Shakespeare's best comedies, the characterizations are key to the enjoyment of this text. Bedsides the two leads we get the malaprop prone constable Dogberry, who accidentally keeps the plot from becoming a tragedy, and the subtle characterization of Don Pedro the prince. There is more to this character than one gets at first glance, and the close reader will be rewarded by paying attention to Don Pedro's wooing of Hero for his underling Claudio. Shakespeare adds in layers there that are interesting to ruminate on.The new RSC Modern Library editions of the plays of Shakespeare are a quality trade paperback edition of the works of the Bard. “Much Ado About Nothing” contains a unique Introduction by Jonathan Bate. It is unique in its emphasis on the secondary character of Hero. I had not read an essay that gave her such focus before.This edition includes an essay on the performance history of the piece, and interviews with directors (Marianne Elliot & Nicholas Hytner) as well as an interview with actress Harriet Walter, who has played Beatrice. Ms. Walker’s interview is insightful because she focuses on Beatrice’s humanity, not on giving “intellectual” answers. It will be of special interest to those who enjoy exploring the multitude of interpretations Shakespeare lends itself to. The Modern Library edition also includes a scene-by-scene analysis, which can help point out an image or symbol you might have missed. The edition also includes a nice “Further Readings” list specifically for this play.Frankly, all of the extra essays allow you to dive into the world of the play, and it is all included in one text.The RSC Modern Library editions are a nice new trade paperback with worthwhile extras. They are a good addition to the editions of Shakespeare out there.

But with a few exceptions I enjoyed reading it, thus the 3 star rating. “Seinfeld” is the only television sitcom that I own the entire series on DVD. I love it, but have not watched any episodes in a long time. This book reminded me why I love the show.Stylistically “Seinfeldia” is very average. It reads like a popular magazine. The author wrote for magazines for many years, makes sense. There is not a transition or a thru line in the book. You will read a few pages on a topic/idea, there will be some space on the page, new topic now.Looking closely at the text’s sources you will see that no one really integral to the series was involved in the making of this book. Ms. Armstrong talks to quite a few secondary people connected to the series and relies heavily on other published sources for her “firsthand knowledge”. Nothing wrong with that, just pointing it out.The final chapter gets caught up in some ridiculous elements, and is a letdown. The book ends on a whimper.Having said all that, if you are a fan of “Seinfeld”, and are looking for something that will remind you why you loved the show, then “Seinfeldia” is a worthwhile read.

It suffers from the bitterness that enveloped Vonnegut’s late life, but he is not completely bitter yet in 92. In the piece he lambastes his usual targets, but he also acknowledges his own hypocrisy. He attacks those who he thinks are hurting society and the planet, all while acknowledging that he is a part of the problem. In this current age dominated by “wokeness” and moral superiority because of one’s views, being reminded of what intellectual honesty looks like is refreshing.Ironically, the unfinished story is the one I was most drawn in to, but it literally ends in mid-sentence.

At times while reading Ms. Tyler it is like reading a story about yourself.Anne Tyler gets under my skin in all the good ways. Some examples:This text has a few moments where the characters, and the reader, are experiencing uncomplicated joy. A small yet happy moment of life that is followed immediately (with no foreshadowing) by a gut punch. Not a big dramatic gut punch, a real life simple announcement that changes everything.I found myself wrapped up in the emotions of the protagonist, Liam Pennywell, a man who comes across the page as all too (uncomfortably) real. In chapter 9 of this novel there is so much reality there that you hold your breath because you recognize and know the feel of the emotions depicted.There is a moment in the text where my thoughts about a character should not be ambiguous, yet they are because Tyler once again binds me up in that oh so human conflict of more than one side to every issue. A father is talking to the child he messed up when he left his wife eons ago. He says, “I just couldn’t bear to go to my grave knowing I’d wasted my life. I just wanted my share of happiness. Can’t you understand how I felt?” Yes, yes I can, because this man is flawed, but not a villain. Tyler also creates a palpable sense of loneliness throughout the novel, without using the word lonely to convey it.This character study will give you a lot to think about, and you will reflect on your own life while reading. It is unavoidable.I love that this novel ends in a realistic manner. It is not what the reader hopes for, but it rings of truth. The last 4 pages of “Noah’s Compass” reek of contentment.

Here are just a couple of moments that I mulled over while reading:“How strange to return to the place of his own long-ago undoing, in hopes of somehow being redone.”“He hadn’t meant to be so blunt, but the answer had arrived on his lips straight from his heart with no thinking in between.”“A door closes at times.

As is usual Shaara writes best when he is depicting regular troops in battle. In this text, he brings back a fictional character from the book’s predecessor, “The Rising Tide”, paratrooper Jesse Adams. A lot of the text is told from his perspective. Adams is a solider in the 82nd Airborne, a unit that fought throughout the Battle of Normandy.Page 176 of this 493 page book is where is D-Day finally begins, and the text is hard to put down for the next 200 pages. The very beginnings of Operation Overlord focus on the 82nd’s airdrop into France and the 29th Infantry’s landing at Omaha Beach. It is gripping. In fact, the novel’s best chapter is the single chapter told from Private Tom Thorne’s perspective (a fictional character, like Adams) as the 29th lands that fateful morning. Mr. Shaara excels at capturing the detail and the emotion of those moments that textbooks with their focus on the big picture just cannot depict. Interesting observation- in the two novels I have read thus far in the series Charles de Gaulle is consistently painted in a negative light. An arrogant fool who seems to have been a thorn in the side of Allied leadership.As is normal for Shaara, “The Steel Wave’ is told from a revolving first person perspective from the points of view of historical people, with the two above mentioned exceptions. The writing in the text is solid, and what I enjoy about this series is that I am learning new things. As a history buff, I love that!History is just people.

Taking this novel for what it is, and getting past a few eye-rolling moments and some bits of lazy writing, this is one of the better efforts of the last 4 novels in Mr. Silva’s Allon series. The plot is slightly less serious and I guess I was just in the right mood for this kind of tale.This novel takes place during the Obama presidency and Mr. Silva takes more than a few swipes at that administration’s foreign policy. Frankly, they proved to be accurate criticisms. He is especially unrelenting on their Iran policy, which plays into the text’s plot.The final chapters of this book give the reader a glimpse into Gabriel’s world if he was purely an artist. A focus on gallery openings and some of the more public aspects of the art world, which we rarely see the series’ protagonist engage in.I also enjoyed the novel’s ending; a positive imagining into what I hope is one day the real world conclusion to the Iranian regime’s pursuit of nuclear weapons.“The Rembrandt Affair” blends a little action, a little history, a little bit of real world politics and some good characters into a nice mix that makes for an enjoyable read.A note, I would not read this series out of order, as the texts do build on each other.

I recall that read being a bit of a slog for me, and I had no desire to pick up any more Robbins. Years later I was forced to read Robbins again, as another novel of his was a selection for my book club. I fell. I fell hard.Something had changed in the intervening years, and I really enjoy his work now. I have read all but 2 of his published texts, and they vary in terms of quality, but I have enjoyed all and been disappointed by none.So I revisited this text…and it disappoints a bit. I see why it did not lead me to more Robbins all those years ago.What is good about the book? The stuff that is usually good with Mr. Robbins: quirky and creative figurative language, some stunning writing (an especially good moment is on page 21 when he describes Native American culture thru the description of an Indian’s performance at a circus). The novel is intricately and cleverly plotted in a deceitfully simple manner. That aspect of the book is really well done. And Kurt Vonnegut’s “Cat’s Cradle” is even referenced! All those things equal awesome.But…At the end of Part II the book kicks into high gear, for a moment. Then it slows down for too much discoursing and philosophy as it meanders into Part III and the introduction of a character I really did not like, Marx Marvelous. This character is a man who discounts all aspects of faith, a rational fool, and I think Robbins dislikes him as much as I do, but he lets him get away with too much in the text. This was Robbins' first novel and it shows. He had not yet learned how to weave philosophy and musings of a deeper nature seamlessly into the plot. For later books he did learn this skill. Part 4 of the novel descends into tripe. Christianity is bad, all modern religion is a rip off of the far superior earth mother pagan religions of earlier times, and on and on. If I were stoned, and a stupid 20 year old, I’d dig it. This book was published in 1971 and is a product of its time.Overall “Another Roadside Attraction” is a swipe at Christianity in the guise of a novel and too much philosophic digression to no narrative purpose.

(And that character is right by the way.)To be fair, the text has moments that are not that good. The ending of the novel is pure schlock, too tidy and cheap by half. That is made worse by the fact that what proceeds it for the most part is not. Also grating is a dead character who is deified by the novel’s protagonist to a point that is beyond irritating. This dead character (Hazel) saves the day from beyond the grave due to her foresight and eerie ability to predict possible future outcomes too many times for my liking. But what preceded these moments is so utterly charming I found myself forgiving this glaring flaw.The importance of manners and considering others, friendship regret, suicide and even a slight mystery serve up the plot of this tale. Easy reading, humor, a lot of warmth and southern charm help make up for the fact that when “I Still Dream About You” is bad, it’s bad. The text is comically touching, and it made me smile and acknowledge the small everyday things that make life pleasant. I can’t complain a lot about a book like that....more",Notes are private!,0,32,1,"Nov 11, 2019","Nov 14, 2019","Nov 11, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10207089-i-still-dream-about-you

It is an independently published text, and I was asked by the author to read and  it. I wish I had better things to say about it.First off, “The Weight of a Moment” would be a better book if it was put out by a publishing house and had the benefits of a professional editor. The writing needs that good editorial hand to clean it up, push it a little further to make it better. For instance, the author obsessively tells the exact time, and to no point. “At 11:54 AM on a hot August day”. So? It is the inclusion of clumsy details like these that a good editor can beat out of a writer.The story follows two men who have each come to major life disappointments. The point of view shifts between these two characters, but when the POV changes there is no noticeable stylistic or voice change, so who is speaking seems random. Often the POV shifts are awkwardly executed and the narrator has access to information that they would not know because they were not witness to it. I can suspend my belief in a first person narrative when this occasionally happens, but it happens entirely too much in this text. Detracts from the novel at a distracting level.A positive note, the text does have moments where there is writing that aptly expresses a nice truth of the human condition. Those rare moments, when they happen, are fine. In all the two biggest issues: the need for an editor, and the story tries to do everything. The book has the components of 10 novels in it. Not just 1. Because the focus is too broad, it reads as melodrama.The idea for the story is a decent one, but “The Weight of a Moment” does far too much telling and not enough showing.The small details mentioned in this , among others, hinders the work. A sharper narrative focus and some revision could make this an okay novel. As it is, it is not even a decent one....more",Notes are private!,0,65,1,"Nov 03, 2019","Nov 09, 2019","Nov 03, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/44298916-the-weight-of-a-moment

People like the remarkable Ephraim Cutler. A man who is almost single handily responsible for slavery never entering the Ohio Territory!“The Pioneers: The Heroic Story of the Settlers who Brought the American Ideal West” is not as good as some McCullough, but still very good none the less. Essentially the text focuses on the settlement of Ohio, which in turn opened up the Northwest Territory. As an Ohio native, and current resident, I really loved learning so much about my home that I did not know. I did not know anything about Manasseh and Ephraim Cutler, Dr. Samuel Hildreth, Rufus Putnam and many others. But I now realize I needed to.David McCullough is such an evenhanded writer. He does not get caught up in postmodern hysteria and judgement. He just recounts facts without foisting modern sensibilities on events. I love and admire that about him. At one point in the text one of the book’s subjects says, “Certain epochs in the history of nations will always attract to themselves a lasting interest. Among other things their origin awakens a lively curiosity. From whence did they spring? At what period was their country settled? For what causes, under what circumstances, and for what objects were difficulties met and overcome?” These words, written over 200 years ago are the problem with the US today. Most people don’t look at these things with a desire to learn and understand context, they just want to feel a fake sense of moral superiority by looking down their noses at it. One  of this book took umbrage that McCullough views these folks as heroes. Don’t get me started on that idiocy!This book is short, by McCullough standards, coming in under 300 pages, but it is an important one. I will end with what Mr. McCullough himself said was the reason he wrote ""The Pioneers"". “What was for me particularly exciting was the realization that I now had the opportunity to write about a cast of real-life characters of historic accomplishment who were entirely unknown to most Americans-to bring them to life, bring them center stage and tell their amazing, and I felt, important story.”...more",Notes are private!,0,52,1,"Oct 23, 2019","Nov 02, 2019","Oct 23, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/42201377-the-pioneers

Just as Martin Luther is starting to make trouble for the Catholic Church. Dismas is a relatively honest man, quite a feat considering his profession, but sudden financial woes lead him to make a dishonest choice, which causes him all manner of trouble.

It mainly follows the story of Clytemnestra, and her children Orestes and Electra. The novel alternates between the point of view of those 3 characters. It just did not interest me, but in full honesty, I have always struggled with the Greek and Roman myths. They have almost always bored me. I thought Mr. Tóibín could reverse that for me.He could not.With “House of Names”, the story did not keep me reading. The author and my respect for his writing did. I read this novel for the nuggets of Tóibín’s skill with prose that popped up. And there were such moments. A fine example early in the text is when Clytemnestra compares the god’s concerns for the activities of humans with her concern for a leaf falling from a tree. The writing is beautiful and brutal, the thought intriguing and skillfully expressed. It is for moments like those that I read Tóibín. The last three paragraphs of the book are the type of writing I have come to expect from this author.

I have enjoyed the first two book primarily because they are not shoot em up detective lit. They are character driven mysteries, and Galbraith makes some astonishingly insightful and precise observations about human nature throughout the text, and oftentimes they pop up in the most unexpected of moments. Lines like, “…he said, with all the conviction a profound dislike of being mistaken could muster” tell you all you need to know about the character they are describing. Character insights are not limited to the book's protagonists, although in the first two novels the author is expanding and building up in a very realistic and subtle manner the lives of the series' protagonists, private detective Cormoran Strike and his assistant Robin.The plot of ""The Silkworm"" is that Strike is hired by the wife of a writer to bring home her husband who she assumes is hiding (he does this often). The writer is found brutally killed and the plot thickens from there. Really the story is nothing exceptional. With a writer less skilled at characterization these books would be quite average. In fact, I have found the mystery that serves as the propeller of the plot for the first two novels to be kind of weak. But the stories are peopled by very real folks, and thus (to me) their real worth, in terms of reading pleasure.I enjoyed ""The Silkworm"". It is not mindless fiction, it is not ""literature"".

David McCullough has proved this time and time again in his books. “The Path Between the Seas” is one of his best examples. The history of the building of the Panama Canal is one I knew nothing about and it is one hugely fascinating story. The 44 year span between the beginnings of the project to the canal’s opening is a great human drama, and it is true to boot!The text is divided into 3 sections. Part One focuses on the French idea for the canal and their attempt at creating it. I knew nothing about this aspect of the Panama Canal. It is a grand story, with larger than life figures, ambitious schemes, and shadowy villains. It’s got it all, and it is edge of your seat reading. Part Two focuses on America’s taking over the project years after the French failed attempt. Part Three focuses on the completion of the project and some of the key players of that aspect.There were many highlights for me in this text, but one moment was McCullough’s detailing of the Panamanian Locks on the canal. It had this reader in 2019 shaking his head in amazement at what engineers accomplished in 1911! As McCullough aptly writes, “They were truly one of the engineering triumphs of all time, but for reasons most people failed to comprehend.” Someone in the time period wrote of the enterprise, “Strongly as the Panama Canal appeals to the imagination as the carrying out of an ideal, it is above all things a practical, mechanical and industrial achievement.” After reading this book you see just how much it is all of those things, and more!Over 40 years after the project began, in an irony that only real life can produce, WW I officially starts on the same day as the first oceangoing vessel passes thru the canal. “The Path Between the Seas” is one of McCullough’s better efforts. And he has not written a bad book. This is a tome worthy of such a monumental subject. I end this  encouraging you to read this book, and with a line from the text that sums it up. “Primarily the canal is an expression of that old and noble desire to bridge the divide, to bring people together.

There was something surely devotional about it, something might be holy even.”With “At Swim Two Boys” Jamie O’Neil has written with an aching accuracy of the inklings of an emotion that one feels is forbidden. This novel really examines how friends begin to feel love and then progress to the physical stage of exploring it. It is a novel that will slam the reader with its human truths and depth of feeling. First off, this is a very Irish novel. The text abounds with Irish language, cadences of speech, colloquialisms, and even historical references that might at times muddle the water for readers. You will fall into the speech patterns, and you can look up the historical references. Don’t let that dissuade you from reading this book.This text has an ensemble cast and I won’t rehash plot points, other than to say that the cast of characters, many of them very well rendered, swirl around two teenage boys who are gay (and coming into an understanding of that difference). And all of this is set in the midst of the tumultuous years 1915 & 1916 in Ireland. It culminates with the ill-fated “Easter Uprising” of 1916.I am going to briefly explore a couple of highlights for me.Consider this paragraph; “Yes, there was something altogether tantalizing about truth. One burnt to tell it, for it to be known. Dreaded it, too, that someone else should say it, their saying it making it true, the truth true, unalterable. He thought of that phrase from Wilde: “’What one has done in the secret chamber one has some day to cry on the housetop.’ Wilde had meant in confession. Was it conceivable to cry out with pride? When asked was there a flaw in his character, he replied that he did not think it a flaw.”Besides being awesomely written I was struck by the character who utters it, MacMurrough. A gay man, who was imprisoned for a while for “gross indecency”. O’Neil creates in this character someone exploring the idea of pride and no shame for what one is at a time when it was considered a flaw. And more brilliantly he does so in a manner that stays true to the time period and not told of in the language and moral thought of our own time. As the character of MacMurrough develops he goes from a predatory selfish man to one who sees that his hope lies in the future, that the world will be better and he can take the steps to make it so. He goes so far as to aid and protect two young men despite the fact that he is in love with one of them himself. At one point he realizes, “And yet he could think of nothing more grand than helping this boy to happiness.” His efforts with these young men and making way for a better time to come is quite touching. I was not expecting his character to take this route.Mr. O’Neil brilliantly captures that ache for human connection (familial, platonic & romantic) that we all crave. At times the text stops you cold while reading. Simple lines, but true true true to the human heart. “Yes, I had known him all my life-and then we met.” and “But I love him. I’m sure of that now. And he’s my country.” Lines like this just sneak into your head and heart and hold on for a while.The novel also has humor. I chuckled when a teenage boy is told in confession that masturbation is a sin. His fury at the Church for waiting until he was 15 and “confirmed in this sin” to tell him is just clever. Mr. Mack (The father of one of the novel’s protagonists) also provides humorous content. He is a bit of a fool but a good all-around person. I adored him. He is the type of person who makes the world a good place, despite being a flawed individual.When I read this paragraph I was stopped by its simple truth. It captures one of those things in life that make us feel complete at times.""I’m just thinking that would be pleasant. To be reading, say, out of a book, and you come up and touch me-my neck, say, or my knee-and I’d carry on reading, I might let a smile, no more, wouldn’t lose my place on the page. It would be pleasant to come to that. We’d come so close, do you see, that I wouldn’t be surprised out of myself every time you touched.”Goodness that is a powerful sentiment! And a better one that expresses the joy and truth of a long term relationship I am not sure I have come across. This novel has more than a few such moments.I was involved with this book. With the language, with the sense of place, with the lovely and painfully real characters. Simply put, it moved me....more",Notes are private!,0,96,1,"Aug 12, 2019",Sep 2019,"Aug 12, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/96200.At_Swim_Two_Boys

This novel is a wordy, at times poetical, text and one that can require your focus to truly appreciate it. The initial reading is slow going and a little confusing due to Mr. Burgess’ style and word usage. It is not a novel that is easily penetrated (pun totally in line with the spirit of this text) but then you start working with the style and language and you and the book adapt to each other and the experience flows better.The text goes from the late 1570s to 1599 (the year Shakespeare’s writing went to a whole other level). A great pleasure in the book are the numerous cleverly inserted allusions to Shakespeare’s work, the Bible, and other writers and writings of the period. They abound in this text, and it is a small joy in and of itself when you catch them.Mr. Burgess imagines in the book that once Shakespeare moves to London and starts writing that he gets caught up in a love triangle of sorts between the Earl of Southampton (often thought to be the young man addressed in the Sonnets) and an African woman. He gets the impetus for this idea from the Sonnets which are divided between those addressed to a young man and a “dark lady”. It is a clever device and works well, especially for those who have read the sonnets. You will catch quite a few references in this bit.Other highlights include a chapter where a young Will writes his first sonnet off the cuff while at the family dinner table. It is a great moment depicting the igniting of artistic impulse. Also fun is the depiction of Will and his wife Anne Hathaway’s early sex life. It is the stuff of Elizabethan kink.As I finished reading “Nothing Like the Sun” I felt it was very Ecclesiastical in nature as the text constantly made me think of that book’s injunction that “all is vanity.” As I read the novel’s epilogue I am not sure that I “get” it, but I think that biblical verse influenced the themes of this text greatly.Mr. Burgess’s style can make for dense reading, but I enjoyed this story.

It follows the adventures of Feste and his new wife Viola (loosely based on Shakespeare’s two characters from “Twelfth Night”) and it has some witty moments. I enjoy the series premise of the Fool’s Guild in medieval times being secret “defenders” of medieval decency. The Guild trains Fools to be the secret behind the scenes good guys and gals of the world. Think special ops with jokes.“Jester Leaps In” is a mystery set in medieval times and the period is its most distinguishing feature and that works fine. This text is set in Constantinople and Mr. Gordon uses a lot of unnecessarily complicated character names which gets a little confusing and a lot annoying. This is not history, you don’t have to give a bunch of characters 15 letter Byzantine names. Just call them Simon, and Alexandria or something. It will work out.But the text does have some humor, is fast paced and boast some really nice lines.

This novel fills out the genre’s clichés and then some.An issue I had with the text is that Silva repeats himself a lot in this book and I never saw the point. He constantly keeps coming back to the same tropes and as a result, the novel felt even more clichéd.A plus is that just like the previous novel, Silva goes after the totalitarian antics of Russia’s “elected” prime minister (dictator) Vladimir Putin. This book was published in 2009 and yet 10 years later Putin still holds Russia in his iron grip. At one point in the story a character muses, “Russians had never known true democracy. And, in all likelihood, they never would.” It is a sobering thought and one that clearly disturbs Silva.In the acknowledgements, Mr. Silva admits to struggling to meet his deadline with this book. I think that struggle is clearly evident in the quality of the novel’s last 20 or so pages.I read “The Defector” in an airport and on a plane. It is perfect for that purpose.

Someone who loves history, “Knowledge was the source of his power.” “The Millionaire and the Bard is a book that was tailor made for someone like me. Someone who loves history, libraries, and Shakespeare. The text’s subtitle aptly sums up what the focus of the book is, “Henry Folger’s Obsessive Hunt for Shakespeare’s First Folio”. The book has three major focuses-# 1-The creation of the First Folio of the collected works of William Shakespeare in the early 1620s, and the history of that publication and its effect on western literature and civilization. Andrea Mays (the author) examines all aspects of this event, from the gathering of plays to include, to the printing process, subsequent editions, etc. I found it very interesting. I have read other books on the First Folio, but this text follows a concise, yet informative pattern.#2- The collecting habits and thrills of Henry Clay Folger. We get some biographical info that is pertinent to the book’s point and then Mays focuses on some of the more sensational moments of Folger’s collecting career to keep our attention. At times, it is almost edge of your seat reading. No joke.# 3- The book’s last section deals with the building of the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington DC, and what the Folger collection became. The fact that this collection is still together and survived the life of its collector as a complete unit is in itself amazing. The Folger Library houses the single largest collection of First Folios in the world, and that is just a part of the astonishing items it contains.Andrea Mays is an economist by training and I greatly appreciated the sentiment that she expresses in the book, “Henry Folger was a brilliant, ethical American businessman. He was an unapologetic industrialist. And the Folger Shakespeare Library is a triumph of American capitalism and philanthropy.” I applaud Ms. Mays’ defense of capitalism because it makes places like the Folger Library possible.By a stroke of luck, I was in DC right after finishing this book, and although I had been to the Folger Library before, having read this text I found this time to be an even richer experience. I highly recommend reading it before a visit to the library.Mr. Folger made sure that the following (by Shakespeare) was engraved above the main hall of the Folger Library to greet visitors, “I shower a welcome on ye. Welcome all.” His life and his gift to the world made such a welcome possible. I greatly value “The Millionaire and the Bard” because it preserves an important story that lovers of Shakespeare, the world over, need to remember.I cannot sum it up better than Mays- “Time has performed many conjuring tricks, but few so fantastic as the making of the First Folio, and the making of the great library that preserves it.”A postscript: Ms. Mays includes a short & informative ""Notes on Sources"" in this text that will add to your ""to read pile"".

O’Rourke is one of America’s drollest political writers, and he is a smart guy too. Mr. O’Rourke is indeed funny in “How the Hell Did This Happen? The Election of 2016”, but the text is just too bitter (and at times mean) for my tastes.This book seems to have been promoted as being anti-Trump, another conservative has seen the light and supports Mrs. Clinton, etc. It is not that at all. Mr. O’Rourke does not even remotely like Donald Trump, but he is equally brutal towards Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and most of the Republican candidates in 2016. This book is anti-establishment, at least anti those who have risen to the top of the current American political system establishment. The text is really just a collection of writings, musings, columns etc. that the author wrote over the course of the 2016 presidential race. A highlight of the text are the 3 chapters called “What They Stand For, and Can We Stand It?” where O’Rourke examines the official platforms of the Clinton, Trump and Sanders tickets and excoriates all of them, especially Sanders. Also interesting and well done were the chapters “Our Higgledy-Piggledy Primary System and How It Higgles our Pigs” and the final chapter “The Revolt Against the Elites”.

They had to become a mob first.”“Good things are made by free individuals in free association with other individuals. Notice that that’s how we make babies. Individual freedom is about bringing things together. Politics is about dividing things up. Elites would have us make babies by putting the woman on this side of the room and the man on that side of the room while the elites stand in the middle taxing the sperm and eggs.”“When are voters in both political parties going to realize that politics is a two-way street? The politician creates a powerful, huge, heavy and unstoppable Monster Truck of a government. Then supporters of that politician become shocked and weepy when another politician, whom they detest, gets behind the wheel, turns the truck around, and runs them over.”“But politics is not the art of being-let alone doing-good.”“Consistency is not a hallmark of American politics, but exceptions are made when the constant is stupidity.”...more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,"Jul 04, 2019","Jul 09, 2019","Jul 04, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/35056538-how-the-hell-did-this-happen

The action happens offstage, we just get to hear about it in some exquisite language. Writer and scholar Harold Bloom has said that “Henry VIII” is a “better dramatic poem than a play” and he may be right. But whatever you call it, I enjoyed it.I gave ""Henry VIII” a 3 star rating compared to other Shakespeare, not to literature as a whole. The Bard is in a class of his own.In this edition the Introduction by Jonathan Crewe focuses on defending the play as worthy of Shakespeare. It is worth reading. Ironically, in this text Henry VIII is the least interesting character in the play. The text has some wonderful flashes, and three supporting characters get the play’s best moments and language.The first such instant is Act 2:1, the downfall of Buckingham, who as he is condemned to death for treason speaks some beautiful poetry. In Act 3:2 we get Cardinal Wolsey’s downfall and once again Shakespeare imbues an undeserving character with a moment of redemption and wonderful pathos at the scene of their decline and fall.The lesson in this, Will Shakespeare can write one heck of an awesome farewell/final moment.Act 2:4 and Act 3:1 are the Queen Katherine show. I really loved what she says and does in these scenes. Shakespeare has given her some of the greatest lines this text offers.And “Henry VIII” even boasts some ribald Shakespeare as there is a delightful scene (Act 2:3) where Anne Boleyn and an old woman share a discussion filled with bawdy sexual innuendo, subtext, and just plain human truth that is an example of the reason I love Will!Unfortunately, the last Act of this play is the weakest, by far. The text ends on a whimper and that greatly detracts from it. Hey, it happens. I enjoyed what preceded it enough to make up for it.The Pelican editions of Shakespeare contain some simple yet informative essays, “Theatrical World” & “The Texts of Shakespeare” that preface every play in this Pelican series. They are worth a read.As for the Pelican Shakespeare series, they are one of my two favorite editions since the scholarly research is usually top notch and the editions themselves look good as an aesthetic unit. It looks and feels like a play and this compliments the text's contents admirably. The Pelican series was recently reedited and has the latest scholarship on Shakespeare and his time period.

She gets to me.I know there is a school of thought that says to read this book and interpret it on a metaphorical level, and I get that. However, I did not read it in that manner. I don’t feel like I lost any enjoyment of the text as a result.The introduction in this edition by novelist Jonathan Letham is a bit pretentious and tries too hard. It also contains spoilers. A friend warned me not to read it until after I had read the novel. I am glad I heeded the warning, but I did not need to go back after finishing and check it out. My good deed is advising you to skip it all together.The first paragraph of this Gothic novel is just astounding writing. It is concise, creates a “voice” for the novel’s protagonist, and is vivid. It sets up the main character perfectly. You know who you are dealing with and what you are in for once you have read it.The setup of “We Have Always Lived in the Castle” is that the surviving members of a wealthy family have set themselves apart from the local village, for reasons that the novel reveals. This dark tale then explores how that affects the isolated, and how community reacts to rumor and being ignored by those it feels obligated to gossip about.I read this text in one day (it is a short book) and I think being submerged in this weird little world for an extended period increased my enjoyment. It has all the makings for a nice afternoon: a narrator who is unreliable, some unexplained family secrets and issues (which the author wisely never fully explains) humor, jealousy, greed, and best of all its focus on the oddities of human nature that we all have.

Well, after reading “Wild Ducks Flying Backwards’ I can say that it (mostly) works.The text is broken into a highly original introduction and five sections. The first section, a collection of travel essays is enjoyable. Robbins’ gymnastic figures of speech used to describe nature is a good mix.I also enjoyed a quirky essay on Ray Kroc (McDonald’s founder) and a thoughtful piece on Joseph Campbell (the monomyth and archetypes).I loved the section, “Stories, Poems & Lyrics”. Unique and original stuff there. In his poem “Dream of the Language Wheel”, we get quintessential Robbins, as demonstrated by this-“Come slide beside me naked into the world’s steamy honeycomb of words.” The adjective “steamy” makes all the difference there. For a variety of reasons. Also awesome, the lyrics to his country song, “My Heart is not a Poodle”. Another highlight is the essay In Defiance of Gravity” in which Robbins explores the missing playfulness in modern literature. It is a thought provoking read.The text contains some misses, most notably 3 pieces that are art critiques and appreciations. I am an art lover and collector, but these pieces bored me silly. There is also an essay on the 1960s with which I simply cannot be in agreement.However, ""Wild Ducks Flying Backwards” ends with a bang with the final section, simply called “Responses”. And it is literally just that, responses that Robbins wrote to questions posed by various entities. I enjoyed my time with this collection. I have almost read all of Robbins output; this text has not dissuaded me from continuing that course of action....more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,"Jun 09, 2019","Jun 15, 2019","Jun 09, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8675.Wild_Ducks_Flying_Backward

The reason is not hard to detect. “A man may be too confident.”""The Merry Wives of Windsor"" is generally loathed by scholars, and loved by audiences. The reason is not hard to detect. It is a non-serious (at least on the surface) and very funny play. Shakespeare wrote low comedy farce. GASP!First off, the 3 star rating means as compared to other works of Shakespeare. I don't feel it fair to compare him to other writers. For the other writer's sake!""Merry Wives"" is a fast paced romp that would be much better to see than to read. The first act of this play frustrated me as reading no Shakespeare has done before. The play is his only comedy set in (Shakespeare's) modern day, and in England. As a result it abounds with archaic English colloquialisms and regionalisms that mean nothing to the modern American reader. You will have to look at the explanatory notes while reading this play. The reader's frustration will be added to by the inclusion of a French character, complete with accent, a Welsh parson, also with accent, and a housekeeper (Mistress Quickly) who speaks with malaprops and misunderstandings most of the time.If you can get over that hurdle (and on this second reading of the play I did) you will find the play picks up steam and humor in the last three acts, and there are some truly comic, and often vulgar, moments. The groundlings must have howled with delight at this play.Many critics hate this play because they say the Falstaff of ""Merry Wives' is a shadow of the character Shakespeare created for the Henry Four plays. I beg to differ. Falstaff’s language and robustness is all there. The story that surrounds him here is of a lesser “significance”. But I guess my question is, so what? Shakespeare created Falstaff and he can use him however he sees fit. To me it seems a minor quibble, and I am not sure I understand the passion it engenders in some people.On this reading I also fell in love with what a great ensemble piece this play is. There really is no lead, and lots of roles for good actors to play with.Take ""The Merry Wives of Windsor"" for what it is, a lighthearted farce, meant as a diversion for its viewers, and leave all the academic baggage at home. The new RSC Modern Library editions of the plays of Shakespeare are a quality trade paperback edition of the works of the Bard. “The Merry Wives of Windsor” in the series contains a decent Introduction by Jonathan Bate, and reading it will add to your experience of the play. This edition includes an essay on the performance history of the piece, and interviews with directors (Bill Alexander & Rachel Kavanaugh) as well as an interview with actor Simon Callow, who has played Falstaff. It will be of special interest to those who enjoy exploring the multitude of interpretations Shakespeare lends itself to. The Modern Library edition also includes a scene-by-scene analysis, which can help point out an image or symbol you might have missed. The edition also includes a nice “Further Readings” list specifically for this play.Frankly, all of the extra essays allow you to dive into the world of the play, and it is all included in one text.The RSC Modern Library editions are a nice new trade paperback with worthwhile extras. They are a good addition to the editions of Shakespeare out there.

There are almost 20 books (as of now) in this series and some are good, some are not. #16 in the series, “The Riptide Ultra-Glide” is not the worst I have encountered, but it is not all that great either.

Truly, laugh out loud.But in this novel Dorsey does a lot of telling, and almost no showing. A mark of weak writing. As mentioned, the dialogue is the book’s strong suit, the narrative however is not good. The plot for the text is flimsy and does not hold up for the book’s length, and the last 100 pages prove this as they are significantly weaker than the previous 194.I read this series for what it is, and thus even when I encounter a stinker I am not all that upset.

Chabon can write. There are some long beautiful sentences in this text. Not all of them necessary, but well executed nonetheless. Once you read a chapter or two you get use to the style and the text flows nicely.The plot goes along effortlessly, and this 196 page story has only 15 chapters.

After reading the chapter, looking back at the title makes you appreciate what you have just read a little more.The book features 15 illustrations by Gary Gianni, who also draws the “Prince Valiant” comic strip. It aids the text in creating the world of the story for the reader.In the Afterward to “The Gentlemen of the Road” Mr. Chabon acknowledges what may be an issue for some of his readers, the so called “incongruity of writer and work”.

Most frustrating is that the 14 pages of this “thesis” are not counted in this edition’s 355 page count. Not cool publisher, not cool. I want those 14 pages back.The last quarter of “Welcome to Braggsville” is just awful.

I love history, I am an Ohio boy (as was McKinley), he was a member of the same fraternity I am (and briefly attended my undergrad school) and I spent an evening insanely intoxicated at his tomb in Canton as part of a fraternity ritual. So I should know more about the guy, right?Although “President McKinley, Architect of the American Century” is an informative book, it is probably more detail than the average reader wants to know. For example, there is a paragraph about a train schedule, a great example of unnecessary information. I almost feel like the author had it in his possession and was determined to use it. Robert W. Merry (the author) is not a David McCullough, or Candice Millard. He lacks their stylistic skills. This line from a speech McKinley gave in Boston sums up the man’s mind better than I can- “Grave problems come in the life of a nation, however much men may seek to avoid them. They come without our seeking- why, we do not know, and it is not always given us to know,- but the generation on which they are forced cannot avoid the responsibility of honestly striving for their solution.” The five years McKinley was president of the United States he did in fact do just that, as this book makes clear.On page 455 of the hardcover edition Mr. Merry writes of McKinley’s first term-“He settled the currency issue, which for years had driven a nasty wedge through the nation. He mustered a consensus behind his tariff philosophy even as he sought to unite the country in refinements in that philosophy. He kicked Spain out of the Caribbean and rendered that strategic body of water an American lake. He initiated the ‘triumphant march of imperialism’ through the stunning victory over Spain. He pushed America far out into the Pacific and into Asia by acquiring Hawaii and the Philippines and establishing the Chinese open door policy. He fashioned a concept of non-colonial imperialism that would guide his nation for a century or more. He developed a powerful special diplomatic relationship with Great Britain. He fostered weighty expansion in American overseas trades. And he gave the country a level of economic growth and prosperity unseen since the early 1890s.” Whew! And in essence, Mr. Merry’s book goes about explaining the hows and why of the above. And for the most part it is interesting reading and key to understanding the America that rose to world leadership in the 20th century.The assassination of President McKinley just happens in the text, no dramatic prelude, and really not a lot of attention given to it, 5 or 6 pages total. This irritated me at first, then I grew to appreciate Mr. Merry’s restraint. Most people with a little knowledge of American history know the basics of McKinley’s death, very few know the impact and details of his political life and especially presidency. Robert W. Merry wisely focuses on how he lived, not how he died.In “President McKinley, Architect of the American Century” we see how William McKinley was one of “the few chief executives who presided over so many pivotal developments in so many civic areas.” As I read this book about a man who died 118 years ago and I read about tariffs, fair trade, war, imperial power, importance of a strong navy, military spending, China, etc. I marveled how true it is that “There is nothing new under the sun.” Read history folks, read it!

Seriously?This epic novel is sprawling, contains a large cast of characters (in every sense of the word) and tells a story that combines the strongest elements of love that we can understand, those of a physical and intellectual nature.This novel begins on the Rio Grande in Lonesome Dove, Texas, makes a long journey to practically Canada by way of Montana, and ends back in Lonesome Dove. The main drivers of the story are former Texas Rangers, and business partners Augustus McCrae and Captain W.F. Call. I cared deeply about these two men. And Gus McCrae has to be one of the most quotable characters I have come across in all of literature. Honestly, “Lonesome Dove” is their story. It is a story of love and friendship. It does not sentimentalize either emotion, which makes it even more palpable, and true.Larry McMurtry does a stellar job of deftly interweaving three or four plot lines into a story that eventually converges. The writing is beautiful and concise (a rare combination) and McMurtry does not belabor points. And in an 858 page novel that is a mean feat!As for the characters, I can say I am a bit in love. No spoilers here, but McMurtry depicts the brutality of frontier life with a savageness that is realistic, quick, sudden, and then moved past. The reader will be jarred from time to time. McMurtry also helps create voice and point of view in this third person novel with subtle stylistic changes in the text as the omniscient narrator jumps from one character’s head to another. Just the manner in which the text was written (depending on the POV) would let you know what character’s head we were in.

This novel follows the adventures of its fictional protagonist, John Lawley, a solider, sometimes actor, and fight choreographer who is caught up in the world of Shakespeare, and his compatriots at the newly constructed Globe Theatre, Elizabeth I, her “spymaster” Robert Cecil, Lord Essex and his ill-fated 1601 rebellion, and the general chaos of English political life in the last years of Queen Elizabeth’s reign. As the author writes in his notes at the end of the text, this novel is the result of his writing about “what you know”, and this text combines those passions-“Shakespeare, sword fighting, acting, theater craft, the Tudors, London, and the play Hamlet”. The first 126 pages of this novel take place on an “interminable Shrove Tuesday” (as the novel’s protagonist calls it) in February 1599. Everything is thrown at our protagonist on this long day and it makes for fun reading. The text also contains a lot of allusions, especially those connected to the work of Shakespeare. I enjoyed that, however the author, C.C. Humphreys, likes to point them out to the reader rather than trust the reader to catch them on their own. I decided I can forgive him this bit of self-congratulation, since I enjoyed the book so much.A moment in the text I found to ring very true is a scene where Mr. Humphreys describes an actor’s return to the stage after an absence. It is a touching, and I can say from experience, quite accurate, moment. The text covers just over 2 years, from February 1599 to April 1601, ending at the first performance of “Hamlet” at the Globe. This was a period of great significance in England’s history, and a period of great artistic growth in William Shakespeare. A perfect time to set this novel. “Shakespeare’s Rebel” is a fun romp through some major English historical moments.

I saw the world premiere production at the Stratford Festival in Canada and loved it in performance. Reading it almost two years later, it is not as compelling. In fact, if I did not have the memory of the performance in my head I am not sure I would have liked it at all. That was not the case with the first play in the trilogy, “The Last Wife”, which I read and loved, but never saw in production.As in “The Last Wife”, a great strength of the play is the contemporary language and angle that is used to convey the story. The characters refer to modern items; they speak (and swear) in modern slang, and have a modern sensibility about some issues. Also, as in “The Last Wife”, Princess Mary was one of the most interesting characters to me. She is a world weary 30 something year old woman, who does not want to care about her sister Bess (soon to be Elizabeth I) as much as she does.This play examines the rumored relationship between Bess and her uncle/stepdad Thomas Seymour. Its great strength is its examination of how one person can make their own fiction a reality by sheer force of will. It also examines the torrent of very dangerous emotions that can grip a teenage girl...and a middle aged man for that matter. The power (and thrill) of being driven by something that we refuse to fully control is a key theme of the text, and a universal struggle all humanity faces.In an opening comment on the text the playwright makes a self-righteous comment about Margaret Thatcher, Donald Trump and Bashar al-Assad. Her apparent attempt to link those 3 people is odious. Regardless of your politics, one of those things is not even remotely like the others. Disingenuous and sick. It detracts from the experience of reading the play.“The Virgin Trial” was hopefully just a little hiccup in the road, and Ms. Hennig will ends this series with a bang!I am seeing the final play in the trilogy this summer during its world premiere run.

It was better than I expected it to be. This novel follows the North African and Sicilian campaigns of the war, a part of WW II I know little about, despite the fact that BOTH of my grandfathers served in those campaigns. Shaara does an excellent job demonstrating in this novel how pivotal those campaigns were to what came next, the invasion of France. I read a novel, but I learned a lot of history along the way.The 16 page Introduction to the text is as concise and informative an overview of the lead up to, and beginning of, WW II I have ever encountered. It should be used in schools and textbooks. Seriously!In this novel Shaara sticks to his formula, each chapter is told from one character’s perspective, and the ever changing point of view gives a nice complete picture to all sides of the conflict. In this text we get in the heads of Eisenhower, George Patton, Erwin Rommel and occasionally of other historical players. However, the book really shines when we get the perspective of common soldiers. In this text Shaara creates two composite characters to achieve this effect. One is Jack Logan, a tank gunner in the North African campaign, and the other is Jesse Adams, a paratrooper in the Sicilian and Italian campaigns. Although they are Shaara’s creations, he uses real things that happened to various GIs and has them happen with these two characters to show the life of the foot soldiers of this conflict. The novel is at its best when we are in combat. Shaara is one of the finest writers I have come across for recreating that experience. The invasion of Sicily is gripping. The author creates vivid and palpable tension as he writes of the US paratroopers jump into Sicily in July of 1943. The human emotions and technical details combine nicely in this section.I read this book quicker than I thought I would, was thrilled that it engaged me in the manner that it did, and I will be reading the other three novels Shaara has written about WW II.

There are quite a few reasons why I think thus. First, the writing can be dry at times. A section in the text on ciphers/ciphering letters is dull, and excessively detailed for my tastes. Sometimes an overview is enough. Occasionally the author, Alexander Rose, is caught up in the mundane. Too often, this text gives detailed family histories, explaining familial connections between key players in the book. That is well and good, if it has a point, but Mr. Rose just talks about them to no narrative purpose. The book also time hops back and forth, often arranged by subject matter, not chronologically- which is irritating and can be confusing if you do not already know some of the history.However, the book has many positives as well. Mr. Rose has clearly done extensive research, as is demonstrated by the almost 100 pages of notes and sources. The last three chapters of the book (there are nine) are easily the text’s best and chapter 7, “On His Majesty’s Secret Service” is especially well done.

I am not sure I would have picked it up on my own.Without getting into plot points, I will just say that this novel, which begins in 1920 Alaska, is a fine example of magical realism. The author, Eowyn Ivey, does such a nice job jumping between these two elements that when she seamlessly combines them from time to time the reader finds themselves captured, in its grip, and not at all sure how they got there.Jack and Mabel are a couple who really do love each other, but not always doing a good job at it. In other words, they are normal in that regard. They move to Alaska after losing a child, and like any transplant are a fish out of water. They have also not progressed with each other as they have moved past their child’s death. Ms. Ivey captures that sadness in a subtle, and pitch perfect, manner.The author was inspired by a Russian fairy tale of the same name as this novel, and what she does with it moves along at a rapid clip. I read thru this book quickly. The plot in and of itself was not that interesting to me, which means that the characterization and sense of time and place propelled me through it. And they did! I was engaged in the lives of the characters. Jack and Mabel and the supporting cast are people I came to enjoy knowing. Ms. Ivey does a lot of showing in this book, almost never telling. Especially in regards to the Alaskan setting. The mark of someone with skills!I have not read a book in a while that I was as emotionally invested in. When the joys came I shared the elation, and the lows felt all too familiar as I journeyed with these people around that wheel of fate and fortune we call life.I read a  of this text that sums up my feelings perfectly.

Kurt Vonnegut’s short stories are usual“A man sells something priceless for a price he can’t resist.”The genre of short story is hit or miss with me. Kurt Vonnegut’s short stories are usually the same way. In his Introduction to this collection of “Buddhist catnaps” as Vonnegut calls all short stories, I am reminded why I love this writer so much. “Bagombo Snuff Box” is a collection of 23 stories that Vonnegut wrote during his days as a writer of short fiction peddling his wares to the various magazines of the day. Most were written in the 1950s. As mentioned, I am not a fan of short stories in general, but Vonnegut’s gift for quick and artful characterization makes otherwise bland stories at least interesting. The first paragraph of the story “Souvenir” is one of the most adept brief characterizations I have come across in literature. My instant distaste for the character made me feel sadness, as there are many folks like Joe Bane (the character’s name) in this world. In one paragraph, Vonnegut captures their essence.The collection also includes some lovely stories that follow Vonnegut’s persistent theme of simplicity. “Poor Little Rich Town” has a classic Vonnegut ring to it and a pastoral sense of life that is not driven by profit & commodity margins. The same feeling can be said of the story “The Cruise of the Jolly Roger”, a tribute to veterans and the beauty of a small and peaceful quiet village life.This text also features three stories about George M. Helmholtz, director of the Lincoln High School Band. Helmholtz is one of my favorite Vonnegut creations. A complete character and one I adore. He was featured in one of my favorite Vonnegut stories from his 1968 collection “Welcome to the Monkey House”. I wish Helmholtz had been a protagonist of one of Vonnegut’s novels. The character was worthy of one.Also noteworthy is the piece, “A Night for Love”. It is a love story, a simple story, and one unlike most Vonnegut I have read (stylistically). It is a story that speaks a simple, elegant truth about human interactions.Some people have criticized this collection (published in 1999) as dated. Yep, some of the stories are certainly dated. They are products of their time, the 1950s. So what? They should be products of their time. You reading this  right now are a product of your time, why shouldn’t Vonnegut be one of his?“Bagombo Snuff Box” ends with a short nonfiction essay that Vonnegut wrote about the Midwest for an Indianapolis magazine in 1999. It aptly demonstrates what I admire and love about him. Being an Ohio boy I am proud Vonnegut’s work was so firmly rooted in the ethos of Midwestern culture.This collection is not good as an introduction to Mr. Vonnegut, but if you have read some of his stronger works and like what you have seen, you should pick this one up too....more",Notes are private!,0,33,1,"Feb 10, 2019","Feb 20, 2019","Feb 10, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/454991.Bagombo_Snuff_Box

Although its primary focus is the sport of rowing, and specifically the sport on the west coast of the US, and more specifically at the University of Washington and 9 crew members and the coaching staff there, it also captures an era and the first 40 years of the 20th century very well.This text does a nice job of jumping between the life of Joe Rantz (the member of this iconic crew team that the book gives the most attention to), the history and mechanics of the sport of rowing, and the 1936 Olympic Games in Nazi Berlin.The depiction of the buildup to, and opening ceremony of, the 1936 Olympic Games is well done. The author jumps from the perspective of the boys on the US Rowing Team to the propagandist workings of the Nazi state and the manner in which they created the image of the games and Nazi Germany that they wanted conveyed to the world. It is compelling.A highlight of the text is chapter 18 where the reader is immersed in the climatic gold medal race. The writing is taut, dramatic, and creates tension in the reader despite the fact that we already know the result.Daniel James Brown is a solid writer. His prose is efficient, but not beautiful.

After following the boys of the 1936 US Rowing Team thru the years of their youth, to read about their decline and eventual deaths in the Epilogue can’t help but make the reader a little down.

It does not stop from there.This is the 7th book in Silva’s Gabriel Allon series and the first one to take on the use of rendition and the role Egypt has played in the geopolitics of the Middle East. The text takes a hard look at the issues in that region of the world. As always in Siva’s books both sides are allowed to air their grievance, but when a Jewish characters says to an devout Muslim “We’re the scapegoat for Arab failings”, and the Muslim character agrees you have to stop for a moment and consider the issues presented in the previous pages.This book was published in 2007 and yet it predicts with accuracy the so called “Arab Spring” that swept Egypt in 2011. The events Silva predicts actually happened, and just as he did in his novel “The Black Widow” (the first Allon novel I read, which inspired me to go back and read the series in order) Mr. Silva proves a prophet who has a keen insight into the pulse of the issues that he tackles in these books.Now don’t get me wrong, this is not a wonky policy series, these are espionage thrillers, and I read thru them at a rapid clip. You will keep turning the pages because Silva is a good writer and a good storyteller. A little dispiriting is the section after the climax where Silva depicts in a sadly realistic manner the way in which media attacks the good guys in the name of tolerance and thinly veiled anti-Semitism. If I did not see it actually happen in the real world I would dismiss it as fiction. But alas, I cannot.It feels nice to read a book where evil really does lose, and there is not incessant navel gazing by all of the characters. The methods used to fight the War on Terrorism are ugly.

Like all such collections, it has its hits and some lesser moments. I will not call any of them misses, as I found value in all of them.Some highlights of the collection include “Which Way Forward”, a commencement speech McCullough gave at Union College in 1994. If only the advice he gave that generation, (my generation) was followed. His encouragements to read, have a moral backbone, be generous, etc. are not groundbreaking, until a generation practices them. Then they change the world.“The Animating Spirit”, a speech he gave about Founding Father Dr. Benjamin Rush serves to increase one’s admiration of America’s founding generation. What extraordinary humans they were, and McCullough correctly celebrates them. In moments like these McCullough is doing what he does best, and doing it well.In “What’s Essential is Invisible” McCullough writes a thoughtful and insightful overview of presidential power and then follows it up with examples and historical tidbits about those who have held the office.The speech “Knowing Who We Are” should be taught in every American school. In this 2005 speech, McCullough gives us the reason for the ignorant state of many US college graduates that we find to be the case nowadays. In addition, this speech makes clear why the letters of Abigail Adams should be part of every American Civics course.Unfortunately, the final speech in this collection, “A Bridge like No Other” is rather weak. McCullough takes some subtle cheap political shots in it, which is why I think the piece fell flat for me.One of my pet peeves is the arrogance of the current generations when they regard those who came before them. McCullough writes, “We’ve got to teach history and nurture history and encourage history because it’s an antidote to the hubris of the present-the idea that everything we have and everything we do and everything we think is the ultimate, the best.” When I read things like that, I am happy, and all I can say is YES YES YES!

He “Who but an arrogant fool would want to be a Master of the Universe?”Reading “The Bonfire of the Vanities” was my first experience with Tom Wolfe. He had an extraordinary ease and facility with words. He is erudite without being pretentious. I also enjoyed his skill at writing chapter titles. Some examples: “Saturday’s Saturnine Lunchtime”, “The Last of the Great Smokers”, “Donkey Loyalty”. They are fun and apt to what the chapter details.This novel primarily focuses on three men; Sherman McCoy (a creature of Wall Street, breeding & wealth), Peter Fallow (a British journalist who was brought to NYC on a cloud of high expectations and has not met them), and Larry Kramer (a self-serving assistant district attorney for the Bronx). Mr. Wolfe brings the lives of these three disgruntled and selfish residents of NYC in the 1980s together in a seamless and enjoyable method in this text.Tom Wolfe writes the ambiguities of self-perception with a keen eye. I have yet to read an author who so expertly writes about the arrogances we ALL have about ourselves, but would never divulge to others, with such a perceptive perspective on it. This is excellently illustrated in the text when we also get the contrast of what the characters think about themselves and their qualities compared to how others see them. For instance, one character sees himself as witty and delightful company; others see him as a loud drunk. Mr. Wolfe makes it clear to the reader that the more accurate reality of these characters is the version of them that is seen through the eyes of other people.As alluded to already, Wolfe’s characterizations are biting and frustrating in a good way. Especially harsh is his scathing satire of racial hucksters in the vein of Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson through the character of Rev. Bacon. This crook who uses racial politics to steal, self-aggrandize and generally make the world a worse place for those he pretends to help made me angry to read, but its inclusion in the novel is key to the larger themes of how politics, media and class envy can pervert justice.Having said that, although the protagonist (Sherman McCoy) is unfairly treated in this text’s conclusion (you will have to read it for yourself to see how) he almost deserves it on the grounds of his behavior. Except disgusting behavior is not illegal. It really puts the logical reader in a hard place. In chapter 14 we watch as unmitigated hubris makes a man, who knows better, make all of the wrong moves in a moment that will alter his life forever. Every wrong decision McCoy makes is prompted by his arrogance alone. He even has the unmitigated gall to think, “And whatever happened, he was morally correct (nothing to fear from God).” As if he has God’s hands tied! That one line says so much about people’s modern mentality.My major complaint with the text is the Epilogue, written as a newspaper article published 1 year after the events of the final chapter. It is cheap and irritating. In a word, I hated it. Mr. McCoy is the only character who really pays any price for his bad choices, and since almost every male character in the text makes an abundance of bad choices, I did not like the unfairness of it. That was the point, I get it, but I did not need it. The text would have been better if it had ended at the conclusion of the final chapter.Regardless I read this almost 700-page book in under 2 weeks and enjoyed it every time I picked it up. It is just as relevant today as it was in its publishing year, 1987.

The others in my book club who read it in their younger days and were returning to it had the same feelings, so I’m not the odd man out.The reasons I like this text are numerous. First off, John Irving writes the hypocrisy and contradictions of human nature very well, and in a manner that does not judge, just acknowledges. Our narrator in this text is Jon Wheelwright, an expat American living in Toronto in the late 1980s. He is telling the reader about his childhood and formative years in his hometown of Gravesend New Hampshire. At least 90% of the novel is Jon’s memory of the past. That is a good thing, because when we get snippets of the present Jon is unlikable and a man who really has not progressed in any true fashion since his mid-twenties. Just as Jon’s self-righteousness and total lack of accurate sense of self gets grating for the reader, Irving writes something that lets you know it is okay to think Jon is a bit of a jerk. I appreciate that human honesty. In fact, Irving said in a 1989 interview this about his character Johnny Wheelwright, “He is puerile. His sense of political outrage is strictly emotional.”A highlight of the text is the chapter “The Little Lord Jesus”. It is one of the funniest things I have ever read in a novel. It is slap dash mayhem, and yet the deft characterizations are so tantalizingly real that it is blisteringly funny. Humanity, when presented skillfully and truthfully, can be ridiculously funny.The “voice” of the title character Owen Meany is perhaps the novel’s greatest strength. Owen is vivid, he sticks with you. The novel also boasts (on page 277 in my edition) one of the best and most concise defenses of religious faith I have come across in fiction.And despite my saying all that, my reaction this time around was not nearly as strong as 20 years ago. Not even close. Why?I am not really sure, but some possible reasons:The first half of the book is much much stronger than the second half. The moments in the ‘present’ in Toronto could have been greatly reduced at no loss to the text. In addition, an editor could have exerted a greater influence on the author before the novel was published. It is a little longer than it needs to be.Yet, the ending of the text made me nervous and teary. The reader wants to have the power to believe in Owen as God’s instrument, even if he is not. And is he? Moreover, as already mentioned, John Irving writes real people. I love that his books are populated with minor characters who are quite real. This despite the fact that in the novel they are only given a few sentences, but in those sentences Irving creates a humanity. Therefore, with this text, despite its issues and obvious flaws, I accept it. I embrace its lessons and what it has to say. Maybe that is the point? As a character says in the text, “Faith itself is the miracle.”...more",Notes are private!,0,84,1,Jan 2019,"Jan 07, 2019","Jan 01, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/406581.A_Prayer_for_Owen_Meany

Some “ghosts” board a bus in Hell and make their way to a portion of Heaven (although it does not seem to be “in” Heaven proper. What follows are a bunch of conversations that the narrator overhears. As mentioned, the story is didactic in tone, but when Mr. Lewis hits a strong point, it is a kick in the pants. This text is a thinking novel, not a diversionary one. There are one or two well-drawn characterizations, but the narrator (I think by choice) is not one of them. I believe the narrator is a sort of stand in for C.S. Lewis himself.Of special note is the “Preface” to the text, which is in and of itself worth the price of the novel. Lewis says more in those 4 pages then most writers do in 100.As a former actor/artist myself this line on page 85 knocked me back a step. “Every poet and musician and artist, but for Grace, is drawn away from the love of the thing he tells, to love of the telling till, down in Deep Hell, they cannot be interested in God at all but only in what they say about Him.” I think that in any pursuit you can eventually lose sight of the forest for the trees. I have lived this experience, which is perhaps why it was so impactful for me.In this short text chapter 11 seems to be the meat of the book. In it, we are witness to two different “ghosts” and their vastly different reactions to the offer of Heaven. That sentence makes this text seem simplistic. It certainly is not, do not be fooled. In chapter 11 we also observe a scenario in which we see how natural love can be warped by our humanity and turned into something quite ugly. It is pretty heady stuff, and disturbingly unsettling.At one point a character says of love on Earth, “But what we called love down there was mostly the craving to be loved.” I have thought about that one a lot. I think this might be true. I don’t add a value to that or suggest that is a bad thing, I just wonder if that is not a huge motivation for something that we sometimes tell ourselves is altruistic. Don’t know…I think that you would appreciate “The Great Divorce” more if you have a knowledge of the Bible, especially the New Testament. It will greatly aid you in seeing what Mr. Lewis is doing with this text. This novel has depth, but does not get bogged down in it. I read it quickly; it made me stop and think.

It is not the type of book I would pick up on my own. In this text, the author Joe Hill has created a story that is entertaining. Despite what I think is sub par writing the plot keeps you moving along and with a few (notable) exceptions the book does not get bogged down in minutia. Pretty much every chapter ends on a very non-subtle note of foreshadowing. It is cheap, but again, you keep reading. I read this 752 page book in 11 days. So, why did I not particularly care for it?First off, any text that has a moment where people kiss and those around them clap loses about a million points with me. This book has such a moment.Especially bad in “The Fireman” is “Part 7: No Straight Arrow”. It just has some not good writing and a boring and insipid romantic subplot the author tries to develop. It is really clichéd and rings false on every note (see above paragraph).The novel is also inexplicably vulgar and/or violent (disgustingly so) at times. My problem with that is that it felt forced, never natural in this book. And therein lies the problem with this text overall. It never feels natural and at ease. It feels like it is trying, really really hard. I kept feeling it was a bit like a comic book at times, especially “Part 9: Engine”. Come to find out, Mr. Hill has written a comic book series. Go figure. Now don’t get me wrong, I don’t want a book to be bad. And this one isn’t, per se.

To me it reads like a first book. Norwegian police inspector Harry Hole is dispatched to Australia to work on the case of a murdered Norwegian citizen, and we are off to the races.Many of the s I saw for this text say how genre busting this novel is. I disagree. This text features an alcoholic detective (will he fall off the wagon?…spectacularly) a woman the detective starts sleeping with (will she survive the book?…duh) and coworkers (do they know more about the case then they can say?…duh again). These are not criticisms on my part by the way, they make for fun reading, but “The Bat” is a basic detective crime noir novel, nothing more.Stylistically the text is very abrupt. A scene just ends, and then a new chapter begins with a different focus, or one further down the road of the story then the reader was last engaged with. It did not bother me, but I have some friends who hated that about the book. There are also some eye rolling moments in the story, as I think Mr. Nesbø seems to enjoy shock value. I have noticed this feature in every book of his I have read. I do not think “The Bat” is particularly good, or bad. It kept me entertained while ocean waves roared outside the window. I can’t complain about that. There are moments that the writing brings up some intriguing thoughts about human nature, etc. The chapters are short and move quickly, and once I was about 50 pages in the book, I could sit and read for a stretch at a time.I purchased the first and second book in this series together, so I will read Harry Hole #2, but unless something really grabs me I can’t say I will continue the series past that.

Within the first 60 pages Israeli spy (and art restorer) Gabriel Allon is at the Vatican to ward off a terrorist threat, and the novel, kicks into high gear from there.One of the things that I appreciate about this series is that Mr. Silva usually gives us both sides of an issue. In this text a character (the Pope) goes on an anti-Iraq War bent. Just as the shots at George W. Bush are starting to get me annoyed (I hate when a character keeps beating a dead horse) another character speaks up with the counter point. Both sides! How awesome (and rare) is that? One thing I greatly appreciated in “The Messenger” is that Silva turns an unflinching eye on Saudi Arabia’s state sponsorship of terrorism, which too often the West seems to turn a blind eye towards. When a character reminds us to “Seek justice, rather than vengeance” the reader really has to stop and think about what constitutes the differences in that in our modern world.An issue I had with this text is that at times it came across as a little melodramatic, even for a spy thriller.

Although I do not think it is a great text, it is a good story. When I accepted the limitations inherent in a story about time travel, and focused on the aspects of the writing that are quite good, and not those that are weak, I found I read it quickly and was no worse for the wear.In short, the story is that of a black woman from 1976 who is transported back and forth to 1815 and the Maryland farm on which her great great grandfather (a white man) and her great great grandmother (a slave) meet. Octavia Butler (the author) does not flinch from the brutality in slavery, and yet it is evident (from an author interview in the text and from the book itself) that she is using the daily aspects of slavery in service to her story, which thus gives them more power. As she says, “The route to readers’ heads is through their guts and nerves, and that requires good storytelling, not just a good set of issues.” With that in mind, she wrote a novel that is not polemic, a danger for any book with a focus like this one.As I read ""Kindred” I kept thinking this is a text that would be good for high school students. The characterization is not particularly deep for any one character (is that a limitation of the science fiction genre?) yet there is enough there to discuss and extrapolate a bit more from. At times I felt the book took the easy way out by not examining some issue further, but again that is not the kind of book Ms. Butler was trying to write. This is not “Beloved” and never was meant to be. Yet, serious issues are there if you care to focus on them, and they are given thoughtful attention. There are numerous times in the novel where some idea or thought was beautifully rendered and I had to stop to appreciate and digest it.

I found this text the most interesting when Bill Bryson turned his attention to the personalities in the science world as opposed to lots of the science itself. He is more comfortable writing on that human angle subject and it shows.For a book that deals with nonfiction (in as much as science is fact, this text makes clear that much science is really nothing more than conjecture) one section that will keep you on the edge of your seat is Part IV, called “Dangerous Planet”. Do not read it before bed, you will have bad dreams. It’s all about the cataclysmic ways the Earth can create (this is not induced by humans, just natural cycles) another extinction level event. At one point the text says about the planet, “For all the instability, it’s mostly remarkably and amazingly tranquil.” Understatement!Although Mr. Bryson appropriately does not explore or accept or reject the idea of a Creator (that is not the realm of science anyway) and after reading this book the myriad of improbable, impossible and /or unexplainable intricacies of the universe, nature on earth and life itself have only deepened my belief in a Creator who put all these processes in motion. As this quote from page 172 says, “We live in a universe whose age we can’t quite compute, surrounded by stars whose distances we don’t altogether know, filled with matter we can’t identify, operating in conformance with physical laws whose properties we don’t truly understand.” There is still so much (most things actually) that science cannot even begin to understand, but too often it is presented as fact. I am irritated that when I was in school it was presented in this infallible (and intellectually dishonest) manner. Bill Bryson mostly avoids that arrogance. This quote appears in some form continuously throughout the text, “In short, we don’t quite know where we came from.” If this book makes one thing abundantly clear, it is that science knows very little, and can prove nothing about the origins of anything!

What you can’t trust are the sweeping conclusion that people often attach to them.”Overall, I liked “A Short History of Nearly Everything”; some parts of it are immensely readable. Science and a bit of history thrown in is always interesting. However, by the last 100 pages or so I was more than ready for the book to be finished. I read it; I was intrigued, learned a lot.

I enjoy biographies and Jon Meacham has written a few that are on my “to read” list. This was the first I picked up; I will be picking up the others. I was only 10 years old when Bush was elected president, so although I do have memories of his presidency the consequence of the times I was living through were lost on me.First off, the text flows well, and is simply written. Its narrative pace does a nice job of (mostly) keeping you in the world of George Herbert Walker Bush. Too often biographies pull you in the author’s element rather than the subjects. This text avoids that trap.The book details the life of the 41st president of the United Sates in a deft manner and there were some unexpectedly very tender moments. The death of Bush’s daughter Robin from leukemia and a section where the text details a bout of depression that Barbara Bush suffered from a few years later are among some of the text’s very human, and thus powerful, moments.Another decently written section deals with the 1980 Republican Convention and Ronald Reagan making up his mind about the choice for his running mate between former president Gerald Ford and Bush. Of course, I was only 2 when it actually happened, but I did not know that it was such riveting political drama. The tension is palpable at times in this part of the book.George Bush was many things, but this biography makes astoundingly clear that when it came to foreign policy he was an excellent president, leading the world safely and calmly through the fall of communism and the many (possible) volatile moments that could have accompanied it.Mr. Meacham had unfettered access to President Bush’s personal diaries and his entry on his final day in the Oval Office talks about the honor of the office and the fact that no one could lay personal misconduct at his feet. Considering what his successor did in that same office it leaves the reader a little in despair that Bush’s generation has passed from leadership and its role in history.In reading “Destiny & Power”, it is obvious that the author admires his subject and accepts the flaws in him, as we all should, as part of the human condition. I learned a lot while reading this text, and enjoyed doing so. I will leave off with something that Bush said once that struck me with its simple profundity, “There are no magical solutions to our problems. The real answers lie within us. We need more than a philosophy of entitlement. We need to all pitch in, lend a hand, and do our part to help forge a brighter future for this country.”...more",Notes are private!,0,43,1,"Sep 24, 2018","Oct 08, 2018","Sep 24, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25387654-destiny-and-power

At one time, he was one of the most famous writers in America. The Preface, written by Thurber himself is a great start to the collection. I noticed that there are many stories/essays in this piece that focus on unhappily married couples. Lots. Some of them feel a little too sharp for me, but “A Couple of Hamburgers” is a story that deals with an unhappy marriage and it is an excellent example of a well-written short story. Two other standout pieces are “Memories of the Gas Buggy”, which actually made me giggle out loud and “Snapshot of a Dog”, which is a simple and lovely tribute to a childhood pet.An unexpected punch in the gut is the story “One is a Wanderer”, a piece that focuses on loneliness and not having real intimacy. It will set you back for a moment.The selections from Thurber’s book “My Life & Hard Times” are easily the best, and funniest, in this collection. You will recognize a couple of stories from that work as many are quite famous and well anthologized to this day.The last couple of sections of “The Thurber Carnival” were odd reads for me. The humor eluded me. I just chalked it up to different times and moved on, but it did lead me to a thought. As I read, I could not help but feel that this text is dated, really dated and I wonder if it will survive another generation. I do not know the answer to that.I live just outside of Columbus Ohio, which is the place of Thurber’s childhood and an inspiration for much of his work. He holds a sentimental place in my heart.

I picked it up because of its cover which I found out later was the impetus for a cease and desist letter from the Jack Daniels company. Either this novel tries too hard, or I was just not that bowled over by it. Maybe both. It feels like it is trying very much to be gonzo lit, like “Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas”, but really it is just a comic novel whose characters are kind of crummy humans with the worst vices we can create out of drugs and murder.The premise is clever; a black out drunk is heavily and unknowingly involved in the “burger wars” between giant fast food corporations. Okay, clever set up. However, then it just goes in circles from there, and at times the author, Patrick Wensink, does not make a clear leap from one point to the other. More than once while reading this book I just said to myself, “We are going in this direction now, I’m not sure why, but I’ll go with it.”The text started out very slow for me, but it did pick up about 100 pages in.

The Hogarth project sees “Shakespeare’s works retold by bestselling novelists of today.” The premise of “Macbeth” is clever. It takes place in the 1970s in a dingy postindustrial town and Macbeth is a Police Inspector, who rises very quickly to the top Police Commissioner’s spot through the machinations of a drug lord (Hecate). The Inverness Castle of Shakespeare’s play becomes a casino run by Macbeth’s wife (Lady). There are a myriad of crafty devices like this in the novel. It works well, and I enjoyed seeing Jo Nesbø incorporate those little details throughout the text. The problem is, I am not sure that if I was not enjoying the book for this aspect if I would have liked it all that much. Do Nesbø fans if they do not know anything of Shakespeare’s “Macbeth” like this novel?A highlight is Chapter 10, which depicts the murder of Duncan, Macbeth’s boss in this version. Nesbø captures very well in this chapter that moment of “no return”. The moment a decision is made that there is no coming back from. It is tense! Another nice element is the constantly changing point of view. We jump inside multiple character’s heads in each chapter, which keeps the plot moving along and the ever changing perspective is more interesting for the reader. Hecate in the text is a drug lord (who seems to be in Nesbø’s hands a stand in for the Devil and his corrupting power). Compared to the role Hecate plays (mostly offstage) in the source material it is an idea that works well.Some criticisms include a stupid scene in chapter 22. In it we get treated to a press conference that feels like it is from a movie script. And that is not a good thing. It is a very hackneyed moment. The last two chapters of the book are also glaringly weak considering what preceded it.When I finished the text I was kind of blasé about it. I have read better Nesbø. But there are lines like the following scattered throughout that made me take a moment. “But do you know what is lonelier than never having anyone? It is believing you had someone, but then it turns out that the person you thought was your closet friend never was.” That says a lot right there.

He is hit or miss for me. I have read a couple of his I enjoyed, and a few I have loathed. I have noticed that those I dislike are ones he has written in the last 20 years.“The Hotel New Hampshire” has all the usual Irving characteristics; a story that takes place over many years, a sprawling cast list, some ridiculous plot contrivances, a little too much familial love for my tastes, a homoerotic fixation with male physiques and oddball characters. And in this text, I was okay with that.I cannot really tell you why I liked this book, but I did. It took me about 50-60 pages to get into it and invest a little, but I did and then I was in. I am not sure I can pinpoint a thematic significance to the text; it was just a family saga. And that is a significant thing to write about. For most of us that is the stuff our daily lives are made of. As one character says of the details of daily life, “Thus we invent our lives”.“The Hotel New Hampshire” follows the Berry family from the initial meeting of the parents at a resort in Maine thru the middle age of the surviving offspring of the marriage that springs from that summer fling in Maine. I have been told this text has a lot in common with “The World According to Garp”, which I have not read. The second son in the family is our narrator. John Berry seems rather unflinching in his evaluations of himself, and those he loves. It is somewhat refreshing to read a novel whose narrator (I don’t think) has an agenda. The plot is sprawling, we go from New England to Maine to Austria, to NYC and back to Maine. It is quite a trip.The book is a mix of some really lovely writing and some fun storytelling elements, and sometimes the two elements even mix together. I have not said a lot that is important about this text. It is a good read, and a unique story.

I will read others I am sure. “My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She’s Sorry” is a sentimental tale, with a 7 (almost 8) year old protagonist whose sardonic voice is a real joy to read.The novel suffers from a slow start. There is a fairy tale device that is interweaved into the narrative that never fully grabbed me, and it took me most of the book to buy into it. Other readers I know jumped right into that aspect of the text. To each his own, right? However, the last half of the book I thought was strong narratively, things started to fall into place for me with the fairy tale device, and from that point on I was fully in.The author uses redundancies to excellent effect in this book. The redundancies alternate between being humorous and reinforcing thematic textual points, and sometimes they do both at the same time. They were well executed, and using redundancy without being annoying is a nice hat trick that Backman pulls off in fine manner. As mentioned previously, the child protagonist Elsa is also an engaging character to read, as Backman infuses her with observations well out of a 7 year old grasp while still writing her as a believable child.“My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She’s Sorry” is a sentimental and beautiful story. A cynic would call it trite, and perhaps it is trite, but this line from the text kind of makes my point for me, “Stories were completely for real, and at the same time not.” That encapsulates this book in a nutshell.

This Cana“But inside this moment, you will always be present.”If you enjoy reading plays, then “Elizabeth Rex” should make it onto your reading pile. This Canadian play written by the late Timothy Findley is a worthwhile read. The premise takes its cue from a real event. On the eve of the execution of the Earl of Essex for treason, Elizabeth 1st called for a performance from the Lord Chamberlain’s Men. We assume to distract her from the impending death of a man that many believe was her lover. We don’t know what Shakespeare’s company performed that night, we don’t even know if he was present, but Mr. Findley imagines a circumstance where some of the company are trapped on the palace grounds due to a curfew being enforced. The Queen spends the evening in their presence to divert her from doing what she wants to do, spare the life of the man she loves.This play debuted at the Stratford Festival in Canada and was filmed as a movie for the CBC. I have seen that version (years ago) and liked it, but I found reading the play to be a much fuller experience. I would love to see it live one day.Over the course of this evening the Queen, Shakespeare, and an invented character named Ned Lowenscroft (the fella who plays the leading female roles in the Lord Chamberlain’s Men) deal with issues of love, sexuality, identity, death and what it means to be a man or a woman. These are not easy subjects to address and in “Elizabeth Rex” this is not done in a heavy-handed manner, but often in a rather simple phrase or moment that can pass the casual reader by. This play does not announce with great pomp its “moments”. Rather, they just creep up on the characters (and you) and you stop and reflect, was that just significant? And in the play, as in life, who really knows the answer to that question in the immediate? At one point Elizabeth says with some resignation, and more than a little uncertainty, “So…here we are-in the moment”. Act 2: Scene 9 of this piece is some excellent theatrical writing, and I was unexpectedly moved while reading it. As Ned and the Queen come to grips with the fates that await them (I won’t spoil what here) we see that universal human struggle of how to deal with this thing called life and all it throws at us. This play seems to say...take it, because it won’t always be there.

Do not expect this book to be great and you will be pleased. I don’t recall how it got on my ‘too read’ pile, I assume it was heavily discounted at the bookstore. Reviewers keep comparing it to “Forrest Gump” and having seen the movie, but never read that text, I assume it is. The protagonist of the title is centenarian Allan Karlsson, who in the course of stumbling quite complacently through life has played a role in some major events of the 20th century. The novel is told from the present day, where the 100 year old walks out of his nursing home to avoid a 100th birthday party, and in flashbacks that details the events of the last century that brought him to that nursing home. That’s it, that’s the book. It took me about 60 pages or so to not be annoyed with the text (something about the style irritated me, but that might be the issue of translation from the original Swedish) but I eventually got over it.The novel’s humor is absurdist, and often quite clever. Although it did seem a bit redundant at times I enjoyed that aspect of the text. The author, Jonas Jonasson, also brings the story full circle with some clever plot machinations and that is also fun.“The 100-…Disappeared” is a quick read, and if there is any big “message” it is that sometimes when we just accept life as it comes we can handle it better.

He broaches the topic in a very different manner than he did in the first novel in the series.In this text, Silva unflinchingly depicts Yasir Arafat for what he was…a two-bit terrorist whose goal was the extermination of the Jews. Arafat is given the unflattering portrait he deserves in this book. Silva makes clear that Arafat’s rejections of peace cost many people their lives. However, what makes Mr. Silva such an interesting writer is that he turns that unflinching eye on both sides of the conflict. He details the Palestinian grievance in Israel with honesty and truth, which does not often happen in books that deal with this issue. An Israeli character gives his reasoning for the brutal expulsion of some Arabs from their homes in 1947/48 and you the reader can hear his argument and decide for yourself what to make of it.I have propelled thru this series because Dan Silva is a good writer and a good storyteller. In the world of thriller fiction, that is a rare combo.

Li“There hath been many great men that have flattered the people who ne’er loved them.”“Coriolanus” is a Shakespeare that I feel is underappreciated. Like in his “Julius Caesar”, the Bard has captured the momentum and the irony of political life in a manner that is celebratory and derisive at the same time.I gave ""Coriolanus” a 4 star rating compared to other Shakespeare, not to literature as a whole. The Bard is in a class of his own.In this edition the Introduction by Jonathan Crewe includes intriguing ideas about homoerotic hyper masculine warrior culture and also speaks of the play’s significance in a Roman and contemporary (Shakespeare’s contemporary-early 1600s England) context. However, it is a long intro and a little heady at times and not a particularly enjoyable read. But, it was a valuable read.The plot of this text (in short) is that Coriolanus is a warrior hero of Rome and is in line for the Consulship (leader) of Rome, but tradition has it that he must go to the common folk and ask their permission. This is a task he is loath to do, and the Tribunes of the people use this against him in stirring up the rabble. And the story takes off from there. As I read this play I kept vacillating between being irritated and admiring of Coriolanus’s blunt honesty and his ridiculous unwillingness to temper his words and thoughts for those he considers social inferiors. Shakespeare is asking us in this play what we prefer from our leaders. Do we want their flattering, their disdain (if they have the skills to lead), etc. It is a very relevant question, especially today. Look at the American election of 2016, or the critics of Canada’s Prime Minster who find his policy lacking but his personality thriving. There are many examples all around the world today. Coriolanus is uncompromising. Is that a virtue or vice we are left to decide. Shakespeare gives this character no soliloquies, so we never get in his head. This choice blocks the reader from Coriolanus' private thoughts and we have to accept (or reject) him for what he is.The text boasts some interesting characters besides the titular Coriolanus. The two Tribunes of the people are manipulative, but their motives could be pure, the Roman senator Menenius Agrippa is a role a skilled actor could leave a mark on, and Coriolanus’s relationship with his archenemy Aufidius is homoerotic in its language. Then there is Volumnia, the mother of Coriolanus who when she is on stage dominates the play. The recent professional production I saw recognized this fact, and Volumnia was clearly an audience favorite. She is another ambiguous, larger than life character in the Shakespeare canon.The Pelican editions of Shakespeare contain some simple yet informative essays, “Theatrical World” & “The Texts of Shakespeare” that preface every play in this Pelican series. They are worth a read.As for the Pelican Shakespeare series, they are one of my two favorite editions since the scholarly research is usually top notch and the editions themselves look good as an aesthetic unit. It looks and feels like a play and this compliments the text's contents admirably. The Pelican series was recently reedited and has the latest scholarship on Shakespeare and his time period.

Donald Ray Pollock has created an atmosphere that is dark, unrelenting, and devoid of hope. I would say that he exaggerates the atmosphere of the parts of southeast Ohio and West Virginia that he writes about, but he has lived there all his life, so who I am to say? I do live in central Ohio and have all of my life, and my belief is that there is a segment of society in that area that probably inspires the truth in Mr. Pollock’s novel. However, don’t mistake that segment of the population for the whole.While reading this book I kept thinking of the film “No Country for Old Men”. It just put me in that vein. This text is not for those who dislike the ugly, dirty elements of human squalor depicted. This is not a book to read while eating. As for the story and the writing…Mr. Pollock has managed to create a gripping narrative in which he weaves numerous plot threads and neatly brings them together as the novel concludes. That element of the text is well done, as is the fact that it spans well over 18 years and yet it is concise and moves along. The author covers that span of years quickly, and yet you never feel like he left anything out. The characterizations are taut and are real, disgustingly so at times. This next sentence is not going to make sense… I detested many of these characters, but was drawn into their lives rather than judging them. I can’t really explain that, because if I knew these people in real life I know my judgment would fly and I would have to work very hard to keep it in check. I especially enjoyed the character of Arvin Russell, who is probably as close to a protagonist as this ensemble lead story gets. He is the only character who ends the novel with any kind of hope, and even then not much. “The Washington Post”  of this book says it so well…""You may be repelled, you may be shocked, you will almost certainly be horrified, but you will read every last word.” Seriously, that sums it up for me. Can’t say it any better.I have now read two of Mr. Pollock’s novels. I don’t think they are for everyone, and they get in your head and not in a good way. Nevertheless, I am glad that he is writing them. It is a voice we should have in American fiction....more",Notes are private!,0,75,1,"Jul 09, 2018","Jul 17, 2018","Jul 09, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/12992927-the-devil-all-the-time

This text, like the others in the series follow the exploits of art restorer and reluctant Israeli agent Gabriel Allon and although the tried and true formula for the series is present here, of the five books in the series I have read thus far this one is the most cerebral.

A harrowing chapter that details the Birkenau Death March is sobering and necessarily unpleasant reading. He manages to capture the essence of the Nazi’s motivation for this ridiculous last-ditch effort to hide the facts of the Holocaust and the long lasting effects on those who survived it.The Gabriel Allon series is quick page turning reading, and I enjoy them from time to time.

Published in 1840, this book is the account of Richard Henry Dana, a Harvard graduate, who spent two years as a regular sailor on a merchant ship in the mid-1830s. This text is a slow read at times and often, especially early on, very repetitive. Thus it took me a while to really get into it. However, it is an interesting anthropological study of the life of an American merchant vessel in the 1830s. Mr. Dana was not really a writer, so I can forgive some of the elements of his style that I found grating to read. For example, for most readers Mr. Dana gives too much specific and very detailed information on the smallest details of sailing, pulling in sails, (especially during storms) minute details of ship life, etc. I could not begin to understand a lot of it. Historically valuable, Yes. Interesting to me, No.Some praises for the book- I really enjoyed the chapter “California and its Inhabitants. This chapter focuses on the people of what was at that time a foreign country. It reveals a lot about the attitudes of the period, and was fascinating. I also liked how much the text kept reinforcing the Yankee work ethic. Hard work and hardship did not bug these men. The only thing that seems to really upset them is treatment that denies them dignity. I love that!I believe the book really hits its stride in the last quarter. Dana’s descriptions of icebergs is simply beautiful writing. No way around it. In chapter 32, “Doubling Cape Horn” we read one of the most exciting and interesting aspects in the entire piece. Dana is concise and to the point in this chapter, and it works well.The original last chapter of the text also offers some interesting thoughts on religion and its ability to aid the life of a sailor and it also cautions the reader against judging the economic value of sailing or overregulating it when they don’t know much about it. It is fascinating.“Two Years Before The Mast” was an intriguing read. I feel my understanding of the world, and early America, is a little broader.

It is entrancing. The text moves right along, tightly paced with short chapters. By page 100, you are in the middle of the novel’s 21st chapter. And the author writes running pretty well. The physical and emotional components of a race.And that is about it for praise. If the book had ended when the protagonist hit middle school, it might have been okay. However, it does not. Overall this novel is shoddy in its structure and writing, and way too convenient in all its conclusions. No issue is presented in the plot that is not cleared up within a few paragraphs, so there is no conflict. There is no depth in the text, the entire thing is surface level. The author also inexplicably has pages and pages and pages where he describes EVERY SINGLE move during basketball games. Every dribble, footfall, etc. For a book that advertises itself to be about running, what is the deal? Dull. There were many moments where I rolled my eyes at the writing. A truly awful aspect of the text is a stupid murder subplot that gets dropped in ¾ of the way through the novel, takes up about 20 pages and then is too easily resolved. It has nothing to do with the story and is ridiculous.

As if the fact that it is a farce somehow diminishes it. That is ridiculous. Accept this play on its own terms. This early play of the Bard’s is one of Shakespeare’s shortest and quickest reads. There is not a lot of depth or subtext, and that is fine.I gave ""The Comedy of Errors” a 3 star rating compared to other Shakespeare, not to literature as a whole. The Bard is in a class of his own.The Introduction by Frances Dolan (in this edition) is fine. It contains nothing earth shattering, but some nice points are made, especially about the use of violence in comedy.As mentioned, this play is a farce, lots of mistaken identity, near misses, etc. Two sets of twins (unknown to the other) are in the same place at the same time. The mayhem reaches a fever pitch in the delightful Act IV. “The Comedy of Errors” when well done would be a lot of fun in performance. Although it is a bit simple, I really enjoyed the minor subplot of Dromio of Syracuse running from the amorous attentions of a large kitchen maid that we never see. The fact that Shakespeare never lets us see this woman is genius as nothing could be funnier than the version of her each reader creates in their head. The same device was used to perfection in the sitcom “Frasier” in the character of the oft mentioned and never seen Maris.The text has a happy dénouement and conclusion, as farce must, and it is one of the swiftest in Shakespeare. Succinct, unquestioned, and done!In “The Comedy of Errors” one sees the budding that later blooms in Shakespeare’s mature works. And this play’s influence has been felt in dramatic literature as it clearly influences most of the great farces that followed it, from Feydeau’s “A Flea in her Ear” to TV’s aforementioned “Frasier”.The Pelican editions of Shakespeare contain some simple yet informative essays, “Theatrical World” & “The Texts of Shakespeare” that preface every play in this Pelican series. They are worth a read.As for the Pelican Shakespeare series, they are one of my two favorite editions since the scholarly research is usually top notch and the editions themselves look good as an aesthetic unit. It looks and feels like a play and this compliments the text's contents admirably. The Pelican series was recently reedited and has the latest scholarship on Shakespeare and his time period.

The premise of the text is that it is during the reign of Henry’s daughter, Mary, and the late king’s former fool has sent the undiscovered private journal of the king to his supposedly illegitimate daughter in order to preserve it for posterity. The fool Will Somers’ notes are actually a very small part of this novel, and most of the text is told from Henry’s point of view and in his voice, with infrequent interjections by Will who has written some comments on the items he reads in the journal before sending it off.Henry does not become King until page 92 of this 932-page book, and that is a wise decision of the author’s as what precedes his kingship is important to what happens during it. This Henry is a product of his youth.One of the joys of this text are the little nuggets of historical reference scattered throughout the book that allude to other historical events and relationships that are not addressed in the novel. If you are familiar with the history of the period you will notice them, if not you will be no worse for the wear.A strong suit of this book is how deftly the author, Margaret George, handles the characterization of Henry. She shows us, she never tells us. Thus, if the reader does not pay attention it is easy to misread this novel. Ms. George is not celebrating or condemning the protagonist. He is a mix of the best and worst of humanity. At times, he is appallingly ignorant of the truth of who he is, and at other times he is brutally honest and observant about himself. Henry’s moments of acute self-awareness and of complete lack of self-knowledge will hit home for any honest reader. Ms. George said that she wanted to “humanize” Henry VIII, she certainly succeeded. The characterization of Henry has wonderful depth and vitality. The device of this novel being King Henry’s journal allows Henry to create himself, a task we all do in our own minds about ourselves every day. The reader must determine what truth is and what is self-deceit. As does everyone who encounters us on a daily basis.The novel flows so smoothly, impressive considering its length. Religion, politics and the personal ebb and flow around each other with ease in Ms. George’s skilled hands. I also found myself annotating a lot, there are many profound lines and moments in this text. Lines like, “Regrets. No one sets out to have a list of regrets. It is a mortal condition.” begged to be underlined and thought on.I will say this about “The Autobiography of Henry VIII”, a historical interest in the period and some Biblical knowledge will greatly aid in your appreciation of the text. I enjoyed reading this novel, was never bored by it and a little sad when it ended. Not my normal feeling when completing a book of almost 1000 pages.

I have already purchased another and added it to my “to read” pile. I can’t really articulate why he is so good, except to say that his brilliant use of small detail and the everyday bits and pieces of life just builds and builds until you are caught up in a reality that completely envelopes you. It captures you because the emotions are so real, honest, and often times for me, too close for comfort.“The Story of the Night” is the first of Tóibín's novels that I have read that has a male protagonist. Side note, Tóibín writes woman very well. Many of my female friends have confirmed that observation for me. In this text we get the story of Richard Garay, a semi closeted Englishman raised in Argentina. The story spans the time of the generals to the late 80s, maybe early 90s. But the book is written in a tightly constructed manner and the author manages to cover a lot of history and events without getting bogged down in them, and we experience them through the prism of the life of the protagonist and how they affect him.This novel is at its core about a person living, and loving. There are not great big “events” or eureka moments. The story is just about one man’s life, a life in a tumultuous time, but a tumultuous time and place that he seems to float in and around of without being all that affected by it. Richard wants love; he wants the ability to be who he is, and to be happy within himself regardless. That is universal stuff right there. Considering the period and subject matter, AIDS is almost an obligatory aspect of the story, and this novel is no exception. But the entire text is rendered in such a straightforward manner that this part of the story does not seem contrived, but almost inevitable. And maybe it was?“The Story of the Night” is a story about a man. Not an extraordinary man, just a man.

That is no small feat for a book to accomplish. To speak to people the world over, for over 50 years, means that there is something universal in this text.We are all the mockingbirds of the title, and anyone who has reached the age of majority knows the feelings that the loss of innocence, and the harsh light of reality can create in a person. Harper Lee wrote a novel that captured the essence of that most universal of experiences, and I for one am moved by it every time.I won't rehash plot points, but I will give you some reasons why you should read, and then reread, this text.The first reason is for the beautiful depiction of imaginative childhood. The narrator, her brother Jem, and their friend Dill embody most of the traits of childhood, and their creative games, and thought processes are a joy to behold. The voice of Scout (the narrator) is a pitch perfect recreation of childhood and childish impulses. Part I (chapters 1-11) of this book are possibly the best recreation of childhood that I have come across in literature.Another reason is a pretty simple one actually. The character of Atticus Finch is one of the noblest literary creations ever written. I want to be like him, and there are not many characters in literature I can, or would, say that about. The fact that being like Atticus is possible makes him even more endearing to me. He is someone who is noble in every sense of the word, and serves as an inspiration for so many reasons. He is a good father, a decent and empathetic man, and a person who tries to see the good in almost anything. The fact that there are so few Atticus Finches in real life makes him seem all the more desirable to me. It is obvious as you read this text that Ms. Lee loves this character. Atticus’ emphatic desire to see all people as humans and worthy of respect (even when those people are undesirable) is a lesson for our (and all) time. It is a trait that many people preach, but few actually practice. Let someone vote for someone you do not like, or have a leader you can’t stand, and then watch the ugly flow forth. Atticus resists those impulses at every turn in this novel, and I am inspired by that.There are numerous other reasons why this is a stellar work of genius, not least of which is the wonderful plotting of the novel, the excellent and fleshed out supporting characters (these people are real to me) and the message that Lee finds numerous ways to reiterate throughout the book.When you get to the beautiful and brilliant chapter 9, the thematic heart of the novel begins to unfold. And every time I visit Maycomb County I find myself tearing up a little at such beautifully human moments. The text’s final chapter never fails to move me emotionally because it is so understated and powerful.Ms. Lee has created a pastoral version of the Depression era south, and even though there is vicious bigotry and hatred depicted in the novel, Ms. Lee (through her characters) does not give up on them, or us. The world, and we, can be better. We just need to remind ourselves to walk in other people's shoes once in a while....more",Notes are private!,0,128,1,"May 16, 2018","May 23, 2018","May 16, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6965175-to-kill-a-mockingbird

The relationship is getting a little long in the tooth I feel, because his books just don’t do for me what they use to. When I first discovered him, I really enjoyed (and tore through) his novels. Now I read his books, they keep my attention, but they leave me feeling nothing. “Noir” is a prime example of that. It is on the edge of being a clever, intriguing book. It never gets there. The premise is classic noir style, a “dame” walks into a bar, and for a while, it feels like the style and cadence of the text is like some standard noir fiction. Then it gets off the rails a little, and is noir in title only, which Mr. Moore himself admits in his Afterward.The weakness of this text is that it tries to do too many things, and as a result does none of them well. Moore just can’t resist throwing in some of his fantastical elements. I wish he would write more books where he does not have to have monsters, aliens, or some other ridiculousness. It is okay, and I enjoy it from time to time, but can he do anything else? There are bunches of plot points introduced, and none of them are resolved with any real seriousness, which detracts greatly. And this is why I could not have told you what “Noir” was about a week after having finished it.Some strengths of the text…I loved the character The Kid. He and his voice are easily one of the novel’s strongest, and funniest, elements. The point of view when delivered by the protagonist, Sammy “Two Toes” Tiffin, is also enjoyable to read. Moore can write some awesome character voices and styles. But the alternative point of view in the novel is from the POV of a snake, who talks and thinks like a human (see my earlier point about stupid things) and has nothing to do with any established major plot points. The writer just could not leave well enough alone.I read “Noir” quickly, and I am not irritated I read it.

It has something to say about all of those topics and doing all that successfully is a monumental task in and of itself. To do all of that well is astounding.The play follows a day in the life of the Tyrone family. Husband and wife Mary and James, and their two adult sons, Jamie and Edmund. Although the play is certainly no comedy there is a black Irish sense of humor that pervades the piece. At times, it is unnerving. The family is currently living together although each member is very isolated and hiding behind the lies that we all tell ourselves in order to gloss over our weaknesses or failures. Every reader will recognize themselves in the denial and lack of self –awareness that all humans suffer from to some extent. The Tyrone family just happens to be in the nexus of a perfect storm of all of these elements in the moment of the play’s action.A huge element of this text are the stage directions and notes, which compose a large part of the play and are massively important to its success as a piece of literature and drama. At times, they convey more meaning than some of the dialogue, and that is not a criticism. In fact the note/stage directions are almost narrative at times, and while reading this play it can feel like a novel.Eugene O’Neill never intended for this semi-autobiographical play to be performed (it was not even published until after his death) but we are lucky that it was. Its portrait of four people is unnerving in its depth of characterization and just plain ole humanness. We will find bits of ourselves in the Tyrone family. For good or ill, it is there.As one character says-“We’ve loved each other! We always will! Let’s remember only that, and not try to understand what we cannot understand, or help things that cannot be helped-the things life has done to us we cannot excuse or explain.” That is a plea all of us could make at one time or another.The universal tragedy (or power) of this play is its exploration of the things that we say (and sometimes don’t say) to the people we love the most....more",Notes are private!,0,65,1,"Apr 29, 2018","May 05, 2018","Apr 29, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/12083.Long_Day_s_Journey_into_Night

Talking to a friend about it yesterday we kept saying the same thing, it fell a little flat for us.The premise is intriguing yet ridiculous, but of course you have to suspend your disbelief anytime you pick up a dystopian novel. However, I did not have to suspend my disbelief this much reading “Fahrenheit 451”. Or maybe I did, and it just did not feel as obvious to me? The book reads as the written notes of a woman (we know her as Offred-not her real name) about her experiences as a Handmaid in the Republic of Gilead (somewhere in the northeast of the former United States).What is supremely interesting in the text is how many gaps Margaret Atwood leaves for the reader to fill. That is one of the more powerful elements of the novel. I feel that those who read this book and come away with a political or gender issue message miss the forest for the trees. In her Forward to the 2017 edition of the book, Atwood seems to hint at that. This story is one of personal autonomy being lost, and never appreciating it when one had it. All of the disturbing issues that the book brings up all filter back to that idea. That is a much more powerful and universal application of the story’s themes than the ideological readings one could foist on the text.There is a lot one can argue about with this book, but I will say that it reads quickly, and the chapters build on one another nicely, stepping in and out of the present fluidly. More importantly, for the most part the novel does not slip into the trap of being heavy handed and didactic, which many dystopian novels usually suffer from. The ending of the story is ambiguous and appropriate, again the gap that the reader needs to fill. I am not sure how I feel about the “Historical Notes” that end the book. It is a chapter formed around the shape of an academic lecture hundreds of years after the events of the story have passed. I will think about Offred again, and I am glad I have read “The Handmaid’s Tale”.

As an adult reading this book I would give it 2 stars (it is okay). The 16 year old me would have given it 4 stars (I really like), so I settled on 3 stars.“Simon vs The Homo Sapiens Agenda” is a YA novel with a gay closeted 17-year-old as its protagonist. Unlike a lot of YA literature, I was not overly annoyed at how the teenage characters in this book talked. For the most part, it rang as realistic to me. The characters did not speak as if college educated television writers were creating their dialogue. Moreover, the protagonist (the Simon of the title) is a wry teenage voice and I enjoyed his first person narrative. Simon is really the only fully dimensional character in the book, the rest are mostly flat, but it does not annoy too much.The real strength of this text is that Simon aches to feel connected. That is a universal human emotion, and the main reason why the book succeeds. When I read the following line I had to stop for a moment, “how the whole point of everything is to find a shore worth swimming too.” Simon spends a lot of the text exchanging emails with another student at his high school who is also gay and closeted. They fall into an online romance, without knowing the others identity. I have to admit, I wanted to know his pen pals identity. That alone will keep you reading.If some children dealing with sexuality read this text, and see themselves in a positive light, I will not complain about that. “Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda” is a feel good novel about a gay teenage boy.

It is a short novel and a quick read that is well plotted and has more than a few twists and turns, most of which I did not see coming. Most of which are plausible and worked, and a few which required me to take a larger leap than I was willing to take without rolling my eyes. So I rolled my eyes and took the leap.Overall, this is a fast-paced novel, with some truly clever bits of shock and surprise that will keep you entertained. What I really like about it was the occasional bit of writing that took this text out of the realm of crime novel and gave it literary moments. Having both elements in a book can make for an excellent read. Passages like the following are an example of what I am talking about. “That we could sleep and dream in such a way that when we awoke it had disappeared, become something abstract, scenes from something that only took place in our heads, on the same level as those treacherous thoughts and fantasies that are the daily infidelity in every-even the most all-consuming-loving relationship.”As mentioned, this is my second standalone Nesbo novel, and “Headhunters” has the violence and moments of human ugliness that seem to be a standard of Nesbo’s works.

We need some kind of tomorrow.""""Beloved"" is a powerful, and I will admit at times, a pretentious book. Toni Morrison has taken the overdone theme of American slavery, and given it a unique and eloquent new resonance. However, at the same time the book reads as if it were designed as ""great or significant literature"" and that detracts from the novel's accessibility and possible audience.This is not a text that one can read and not be fully committed to. It is also a text that gets richer on rereading, and I only hope that more people give it that chance. This makes my 6th reading of this novel, and I appreciate it more than I did the first time I read it. That says something about it.Oddly, the book's power transcends most of its characters. Although they are interesting, and at times painfully real, it is the poetical manner in which Morrison renders their views and thoughts that leaves the reader breathless. Too often slavery has been glossed over with the focus on its physical marks and manifestations. Morrison makes the emotional scars and the lack of human dignity the real abuse, and it is in taking that approach that Morrison transcends the historical or generational limitations that this subject could impose on readers. Anyone who has felt the sting of indignity or the lack of companionship will find relevance in this novel. Morrison's former slaves are forced into these situations by their former and current circumstances, but we can all connect to the emotional content of most of their story. It is the oldest story around. People needing other people, and a sense of self-worth. We all get that. This passage where a former slave wonders about the very basic traits of life always punches me in the gut as I cannot imagine a life where I thought this way...“Could she sing? (Was it nice to hear when she did?) Was she pretty? Was she a good friend? Could she have been a loving mother? A faithful wife? Have I got a sister and does she favor me? If my mother knew me would she like me?”Another thematic powerhouse is the idea of memory and the past and its permanent place in our present. That struggle is a real one, and although I hope no one reading this has a past issue on par with human bondage, we can still relate to the idea of living in a present that does not want to leave something in the past back there.The novel's hopeful ending nicely ties up the horror that preceded it, and gives the reader of sense of the future belonging to those who wish to embrace it.The strength of ""Beloved"" is its amazing use of figurative language. Yet, the ambiguity and ethereal nature of certain sections may leave some readers scratching their heads. There is a reoccurring motif that references the Middle Passage that it took me more than a few readings to start to get a handle on. If that happens, put it down, come back to it later, and read it again.“Beloved” is a remarkable achievement.

It is a“Awake your senses, that you may the better judge.”If all you know about “Julius Caesar” is reading it in high school, you need to revisit it. It is a much deeper and richer text then I assume most high school readings of it allow.I gave ""Julius Caesar"" a 4 star rating compared to other Shakespeare, not to literature as a whole. The Bard is in a class of his own.The introduction to this play by Douglas Trevor is spectacular. Insightful, interesting and easy to follow. It is one of the best intros I have ever read to a Shakespeare play. Don’t skip it!Shakespeare opens this play with thoughtful and subtle character development. To really appreciate this piece you have to pay attention to what he is doing in the first act. The careful exposition is some of the most complex of the canon. And when Act 3 hits, look out! Act 3:2 contains the famous contrasting funeral orations delivered about the recently assassinated Caesar, and is the highlight of the text. Brutus delivers a logical, straightforward appeal to the Romans as to why he slew Caesar. Marc Antony however delivers a whopping emotional barn burner that beautifully manipulates the common rabble. Shakespeare’s use of irony in this scene is gripping. The assassin (a killer!) delivers the most honest dialogue in this text, whereas Marc Antony is a deceitful puppet master. In even more delicious irony Cassius, who manipulated Brutus into joining the conspiracy in the first place, (and about whom Caesar very accurately says has a “lean and hungry look”) fears the manipulative Marc Antony and vigorously tries to convince Brutus not to trust him. The reason is simple, Cassius knows his own kind.Marc Antony’s “Friends, Romans, Countrymen” speech is perhaps one of the greatest pieces of rhetoric written in English. It is a joy to read. Using all 3 rhetorical appeals (logos, ethos & pathos) Antony masterfully manipulates and directs the actions of the citizenry all while profusely stating he is doing the opposite. You can’t help but admire the guy, and the artistry of Shakespeare on display here. I believe it also offers some insights into how Shakespeare viewed humanity and our foolish natures. How easily reason can leave us, and how easily emotion is used to control.“Julius Caesar” is really a play about Brutus, and he is indeed the noblest man in the text. From his reasons to taking down Caesar, his personal business dealings, his obvious love for his wife and even his treatment of his servants-all are a testament to his being an “honorable man”. Marc Antony on the other hand manipulates the masses, betrays and gossips about his allies, and seeks power for the wrong reasons. Shakespeare is saying something here about how shallow relying on one’s public words can be. They tell us nothing really of the truth of the individual.The Pelican editions of Shakespeare contain some simple yet informative essays, “Theatrical World” & “The Texts of Shakespeare” that preface every play in this Pelican series. They are worth a read.As for the Pelican Shakespeare series, they are one of my two favorite editions since the scholarly research is usually top notch and the editions themselves look good as an aesthetic unit. It looks and feels like a play and this compliments the text's contents admirably. The Pelican series was recently reedited and has the latest scholarship on Shakespeare and his time period.

The prose is not especially great, and I do not necessarily think that it has much thematic depth. It is just a nice literary historical thriller, and I enjoyed that about it.Some quibbles: it is decently written, although the dialogue can be stilted. I think this was deliberate on the author’s part to create the cadence and style of the late 19th century, and most of the time it worked. There is also lots of exposition and discussion of psychological motivation in this book. I actually liked that aspect, but I can see why many people don’t. The novel could have been 50 pages shorter and no worse for the wear.However, “The Alienist” is one of the most atmospheric novels I have read in a long time. The New York City of the Gilded Age comes alive in Caleb Carr’s excellent hands. I felt the grit, the extravagant wealth, and most especially the stink and squalor of the tenements. A sense of time and place is very key to the success of this text.Just as successful is the relationships among the novel’s protagonists, a team brought together off the books to track down a serial killer whose crimes are inconvenient for the powers that be in NYC. I believed the relationships and interactions between them, and that helps develop the novel’s sense of fullness. Also fun is Mr. Carr’s interweaving of historical people and events into the narrative. “The Alienist” feels like it could be a true crime story, except it is completely made up!As for the plot, it is one that will have the reader intrigued and disgusted (unflinchingly so) at times, and one that keeps propelling you thru the text.

Unlike most of Shakespeare's work, ""The Tempest"" seems to have come mostly from the Bard's own mind, and does not have source materials from which Shakespeare lifted the plot. Pulling from a few current events and bits and pieces of the literature of the day Shakespeare constructed a piece that takes place in less than one day. The play takes the form of following three separate groups on an enchanted isle. A group of noblemen, which contains individuals who gained power through the usurpation of the rightful ruler, a comic duo who stumble about in drunkenness and plot evil deeds (the play's comic relief) and the ""lord"" of the island (Prospero) and his spirit world servants. The latter group shipwrecked the first two on the island on purpose. When the three plots converge in the final act of the text, Shakespeare gives the reader a satisfying conclusion, but one that still has shades of sadness and darkness to it. The famous epilogue of the play spoken by Prospero (Now my charms are all o'erthrown...) leaves the reader with a plethora of questions and emotions. This epilogue is one of the most beautiful pieces in the entire canon. And one of the most ambiguous.It has become fashionable to make ""The Tempest"" a valedictory play for Shakespeare, and there are many moments in the text that can be read as Prospero speaking for Shakespeare. At the play's conclusion Prospero frees his trusty servant Ariel (some say his muse), acknowledges the half-human Caliban as ""mine own"" (some say his own dark nature) and gives up his magic powers (his talent). This is an appropriate reading, and a satisfying one for lovers of Shakespeare. Just be careful not to limit the text to just that interpretation.I think the greater strength in the piece is its portrayal of the absolute humanity of forgiveness, and how lucky we as humans are to be able to practice it. The most poignant scene in Shakespeare begins at the beginning of Act V when Ariel tells Prospero that he would be moved to pity for the people that Prospero has entrapped on the island (with the plan of taking revenge) ""were I human"". This stunning declaration causes Prospero to recant his vengeful purposes, ""the rarer action is in virtue than in vengeance."" A grown up Shakespeare has lived a life and seen the capacity for good that humanity can engender. It is hard to imagine the man who wrote ""The Tempest"" as the same man who wrote the revenge blood fest ""Titus Andronicus"" so many years earlier. A mature work, from a mature playwright!The new RSC Modern Library editions of the plays of Shakespeare are a quality trade paperback edition of the works of the Bard. “The Tempest” in the series contains an engaging Introduction by Jonathan Bate. It explores some similarities between Shakespeare’s work and Marlowe’s “Dr. Faustus” that I had never before considered. In addition, it engages the debate about the New Historicist reading of this play, a reading I have never favored. This edition includes an essay on the performance history of the piece, and interviews with a prominent directors (Peter Brook, Sam Mendes and Rupert Goold). It will be of special interest to those who enjoy exploring the multitude of interpretations “The Tempest” lends itself to. The Modern Library edition also includes a scene-by-scene analysis, which can help point out an image or symbol you might have missed. The edition also includes a nice “Further Readings” list specifically for this play.Frankly, all of the extra essays allow you to dive into the world of the play, and it is all included in one text.The RSC Modern Library editions are a nice new trade paperback with worthwhile extras. They are a good addition to the editions of Shakespeare out there.

From Shakespeare’s deposition in the case, the only instance we have of the Bard speaking as himself, author Charles Nicholl creates for the reader a tantalizing (at times) intellectual exercise about what Shakespeare’s life might have been like from 1604-1606 in his book “The Lodger Shakespeare”.This text is only for those who are very interested in the life and times of Shakespeare. Having an interest in just one of these two items will leave the reader bored a lot of the time.A quibble with the book is the fact that (as the quote in my title alludes to) most of this text, at least the parts concerning William Shakespeare, is speculative. Mr. Nicholl gives us some interesting things to think about Shakespeare’s day-to-day life based on close reading of some of the plays written in the time period covered. They are fun to imagine, but not remotely factual. Which to his credit, the author acknowledges often. Ironically, the parts of the text that were most interesting to me were the parts where Nicholl creates scenarios after close reading of the literary and nonfiction texts of the period.Part Four of this book might be more information about Elizabethan female headdresses and wigs then most people care to know. I count myself among that group.Special note was the superb chapter 28, where Nicholls details Jacobean marriage customs and connects it to two of Shakespeare’s plays, “Measure for Measure” and “All’s Well that Ends Well”. “Part 5: Among Strangers” is another strong aspect of this text.The book also includes the entire original documents from the 1612 court case that inspired the text in an appendix.

You do not realize it is pulling you in, but it does so, bit by bit. Every time I picked up the book, I read for long periods. The novel is a modern version (slight retelling) of Shakespeare’s “King Lear.” The text begins in 1979 on an Iowa farm, and is told from the perspective of the eldest of three daughters, Ginny Cook. Ginny is the surrogate for Shakespeare’s Goneril. As mentioned, the text is based on “King Lear’, but it is different enough from that story that as you read when you sometimes see the parallels it is jarring (in a good way). The author, Jane Smiley, was judicious and clever in her use of these moments.The author’s depiction of farm life and her attention to the mundane details of that life make the world of this text all that more real. It is well done and gives the novel a full feeling.Some strong moments in the book include a scene in chapter 29 where a character remembers suppressed childhood trauma. It is concise and harrowing in its portrayal of that awakening. Equally strong is chapter 33, which is one of the most realistic depictions of a fight between a long time couple that I have ever read. What is unsaid is powerful, and I cringed in recognition while reading it.I have read s where some have bemoaned the fact that “A Thousand Acres” is a dark text, and the ending is depressing.

It is a good read, with some excellent characterization and I read it at a decent pace and enjoyed it while doing so. However, when I was done with it, I was like “well, that was good, what’s next?” I was hoping for it to induce more than that in me. After discussing it with my book club, I moved up my opinion of it. I am content to give it 4 stars in the end.The good thing about this novel is that the suspense builds nicely, the story is an interesting one, and Louise Erdrich is a smart enough writer not to harangue the reader with “issues”. She could easily have made this a novel about legal jurisdiction on Indian reservations, the effects of colonization on Native Americans hundreds of years after the fact, the impact of Catholicism on native populations, etc. However, to do so would have been to write a boring and pedantic novel. Instead, she has written a really interesting story that touches on (without whining or preaching) those topics in the context of a much more interesting human story that I doubt would isolate any reader. Kudos to her for that.One of the joys of this text is the unexpected humor (it is quite funny at times) and the author’s wonderful grasp of teenage boys. The characterization of the protagonist, 13-year-old Joe, and his three friends is well done. The book is set in 1988. I was a teenage boy in the 80s once, I recognized myself in many of the elements and characteristics she imbues the characters with in this text. The book is filled with real people, and there were times I was unexpectedly moved by some subtle element Erdrich created within a character. This happens in real life, and when novels capture that it pleases me to no end.I have some small quibbles with the conclusion of the novel, but overall it is an enjoyable read.

And I could do without the hero having a fling with the femme fatale of the piece, but the stories are intriguing and Silva is a good storyteller and writer, unlike many who write in this genre.This book focuses on the Swiss looting of art treasures and collaboration with the Nazis during WW II. This is not speculative, it happened. Mr. Silva interweaves this historical travesty within an interesting caper that also gives the reader a lot of details about music, especially classical violin pieces and mid twentieth century art and its place in the World War. You actually learn some things in this text.I was impressed with how skillfully and convincingly Silva gets in the mind of a great musician while they are playing. It is some of the best writing in the book when he puts us in the head of a virtuoso violinist as she wrestles with the music in private practice sessions.

(see above note) However, for what it is, and its intended audience, I think it is fine for what it seems meant to do. I am not a person who is in doubt about the divinity of Christ, but I am a person who is very intellectual in my approach to many aspects of religion, and I can see why some folks on intellectual grounds disregard it.Here are my thoughts on this text, which seems to be written with the goal of giving a person intellectual/logical reasons to believe in Christ.1.	Chapter 2 (Lord, Liar, or Lunatic) presents some interesting thoughts about Christ that I had  never considered.2.	I see some flaws and weaknesses in some of Josh McDowell’s arguments. But find me a  philosophy or argument that does not have weak points. I will not discard the text for that  reason.3.	I found especially intriguing the section called “Bibliographical Test” which makes a potent  argument for the historical truth of the New Testament manuscripts that I had never really  given much thought to. I looked elsewhere to find if McDowell was alone in presenting this  information. He is not. Religious and secular scholars back his points up.4.	Ironically, for a text that makes an intellectual argument for Christ, I found chapter 5 (Who Would Die for a Lie?) and chapter 11 (He Changed My Life) to be the most persuasive aspects of the book. Chapter 5 is a very simple ethical rhetorical appeal that is so simplistic I was stunned momentarily by its power. Chapter 11 is a plain old emotional appeal that is the author’s personal testimony about finding Christ.Overall, I am not sure if “More Than a Carpenter” is a successful text or not. I do not feel that I am its intended audience, yet I did find aspects of it that reinforced my faith.If the topic interests you, take a look.

First, the length, this 842-page book could have been 300 pages shorter (easily) and lost nothing for that editing. If there was an editor on this project, I saw no evidence of them. Number one leads to number two, as there are the pointless subplots that go on and on to no point. An example is the town follies the protagonist writes and directs during his time traveling 1960s life. I mean this trite item gets tons of attention, and keeps resurfacing. Another example you ask. Did any reader pick up this book to hear about a high school teacher directing “Of Mice and Men” for the high school drama performance, which of course made all the football players in the show cry.

This revealing gaps of the plot piece by piece is a common device, but Vonnegut employs it really well in this book. It comes across as effortless, and not at all contrived.“Hocus Pocus” is the life story of the narrator Eugene Debs Hartke. The novel takes on themes of parenting, adultery, mental instability, the Vietnam War, socialism, atheism, and the distinction in social classes brought about by race and wealth. That’s a lot of stuff to take on, and I did not mention all of it. And every last bit of it done with vintage Vonnegut black humor and dry wit.Vonnegut is especially harsh on the irresponsibly wealthy and on those behind the Vietnam War in this book. Frankly, I feel that in the context in which he presents those opinions in the plot he is more than justified.This novel did not feed me as much of some of Vonnegut’s other works, but it is a good book nonetheless.

This is a text that I think is ridiculously overpraised and it is overwritten, and yet it is a good book, and at times it is beautifully written and realized.The text shifts between the present (mainly 2005, after the narrator’s tour of duty) and his time in country in Iraq (fall of 2004). This is an effective narrative choice as it gives the protagonist perspective and the space of time to analyze his war experiences. The story focuses mainly on the narrator and his buddy and how the war shapes their relationship and effects them as individuals. It is a story that is told on the surface level only, but the strength of Kevin Powers’ writing is that he conveys much more depth and meaning than just what the words say. This allows the novel to clock in at a quick 226 pages, and still be a fully realized story.Another strength of the text is the use of gaps in information. Pieces of the whole story are slowly revealed to the reader, and each little piece is revealed with no fanfare. It just appears nonchalantly at the appropriate time in the narrative. It is well done. There is also an interior monologue in chapter seven that the narrator delivers (pages 144-146 in the hardcover) that is breathtaking. The prose in “The Yellow Birds” is lyrical and at times, it is the novel’s greatest asset. At other times it is its own worst enemy.The ending of the novel seems to just peter out and it detracts from what otherwise is a solid text.This is the second or third novel I have read that deals with America’s Arab wars and none of them has really satisfied me. Maybe I am too close to the experience. Maybe we need a gap of time. I am not sure. Regardless, I am glad that I read “The Yellow Birds”.

Its predecessor, “Fool”, was clever and an enjoyable read. This one just did not do it for me.Christopher Moore seems unable to give up a lame joke. This novel is his standard vulgarity (mix and repeat and repeat and repeat…) distasteful sexual jokes (am I the only person not interested in a protagonist who has sex with a sea serpent? In addition, Moore has used this motif in more than a few texts, enough to make me worry about him a little) and stories that seem to not have an end in mind. Too many times in this book I would read a clever moment that was too quickly followed by something just painful and ridiculous to read. There were moments where I was embarrassed for the writer. A novel should not make me feel like that. Frustratingly, the premise is fun, the Fool from “King Lear”, now in the Venice of Shakespeare’s “Othello” and “Merchant of Venice”. What a great idea! Moreover, there are moments that are good. But they are not sustained, and the stuff that follows each one detracts in such a manner that the book just does not recover.“The Serpent of Venice” is mainly not good because Mr. Moore uses no original ideas in executing his concept.

And Kate Hennig’s “The Last Wife” is certainly that. “If anything’s true it’s what we feel.”It is always exciting to discover a really good new play! And Kate Hennig’s “The Last Wife” is certainly that. Commissioned by the Stratford Festival in Ontario Canada, this play is a “contemporary retelling” of the marriage of Katherine Parr and Henry VIII. Ms. Hennig is writing a trilogy of plays about the Tudor women, examining the sexual and gender politics of those women and that period. I did not see this play in performance at Stratford, but after seeing the extraordinary production of the second piece in the trilogy, I had to go back and read this one. The plays are each meant to be stand-alone works, so you are not obligated to a series if you just want to pick up a good play and not be committed to anything more.A great strength of the play is the contemporary language and angle that is used to convey this story steeped in history. The characters refer to modern items; they speak (and swear) in modern slang, and have a modern sensibility about some issues. Yet as you read, you feel like you are in the 1540s with these people. Mainly because the things they feel are relevant, and the issues they confront are human and long lasting, and thus the power of the piece. This particular story might have happened long ago, but it still happens today in various forms and its contemporary relevance leaps off the page.I especially enjoyed the characterization of Kate (as she is called) Parr and her subtle machinations. In the hands of a good actress the script makes it very plausible that Kate is sneaky, or very sincere…or more likely a bit of both. Also especially vibrant is the character of Mary (Bloody Mary to history) who is wry, sardonic, and not at all a fool. Really, all of the characters come across as human, and for a play’s text alone to do that is no minor feat.I have seen the second play in the series, “The Virgin Trial”, and I will be reading it soon. Already looking forward to seeing future productions of “The Last Wife”.

""Fo""Life is loneliness, broken only by the gods taunting us with friendship and the odd bonk.""Not since Shakespeare has Shakespeare been this clever. ""Fool"" is a retelling of Shakespeare's ""King Lear"" from the Fool's perspective. The fool in Shakespeare's text is an integral supporting character who utters most of the play's philosophical secrets. Moore picks up on that and expands it into the plot for this novel.Although I have heard many people say (including Mr. Moore) that you don't need to be familiar with ""King Lear"" in order to appreciate this book, I am not sure I agree. The basis of the plot is that all of the intrigues that one reads and sees in the original play are actually the machinations of the fool, named Pocket in Moore's version, who is manipulating almost all of the novel's actions. This is a clever device, and well woven into the original story from the play. It is appreciated on a whole other level if one can actually recognize what Moore is doing. In order to get this, one must know Shakespeare's ""King Lear"".One of the strengths and weakness of this text is its humor. It is clever, and mindbogglingly vulgar at times. That is a blessing and a curse. Too much of a good thing becomes an irritation, and after a while it takes away from the story and the characters themselves, turning them into caricatures. A little more restraint on Moore's part with the bawdy humor would have gone a long way.One of the strengths of this text is the creation of Pocket. His is a wonderful voice to guide the reader and through his eyes most of the other characters come across as believable, despite some of their more outrageous characteristics. No easy feat, kudos to Moore.This comic novel has some touching moments, and if you are familiar with British humor, you will enjoy the numerous nods Mr. Moore makes to a style of humor that he freely admits he loves. Also fun for those who are familiar with the Bard are the references to at least a dozen of his other works strewn throughout the text. The novel mimics and celebrates the anachronisms to be found in Shakespeare and also very cleverly utilizes the pagan and Christina references that are both in the original ""King Lear""I enjoyed this novel, but the ending is a letdown.

This novel is part of the “Hogarth Shakespeare” a project where noted contemporary authors write cover versions of Shakespeare’s works. I will read more in this series, but not because of “The Gap of Time.”I have never read any of Jeanette Winterson’s work before, and she clearly is a gifted writer. There are moments in this text where the prose is beautiful and profound. At times, I had to sit for a second and digest what I had just read. Lines like, “Forgiveness is a word like tiger-there’s footage of it and verifiably it exists but few of us have seen it close and wild or known it for what it is” and “And the things that change us forever happen without us knowing they would happen. And the moment that looks like the rest is the one where hearts are broken or healed.” That is good stuff right there.Unfortunately those moments are buried in a text that is melodrama of the highest order, and has more than a few aspects where I have no clue what the author was thinking. Now before you get mad and say much of Shakespeare is melodramatic, I am well aware. However, his gift was taking melodrama and bringing great human truth and beauty to it. He is Shakespeare, so I forgive Ms. Winterson for not being able to pull it off. What I do blame her for are some choices that seem too cute by half. The decision to make much of this plot and thematic relevance rest on a video game is superfluous and brings nothing to the text. Her insistence on being “modern” is also cloying and a bit irritating. She really wants to show how progressive she is. Rarely have I read a book where the author wants you to be well aware that this person is black, this one gay, this one Jewish, this one lapsed Christian, this one German, this one Trans, etc. It is a bit much. Write a real fully developed character and that will speak to me. I do not need you to label a two dimensional character for me.

It is nothing revelatory but it is enlightening and enhances appreciation of the text.“Romeo & Juliet” boasts an astounding opening scene that swings from Sampson & Gregory’s teenage one-upmanship and misogyny to a terrible brawl, and finally to Romeo’s forlorn love loss of his feminine ideal Rosaline. It sets up everything that is to follow succinctly and it is brilliantly written. Every character on the page is a real person.Accurately portrayed teen angst is the key to “Romeo & Juliet”, and Shakespeare knocked it out of the park with this one. If one reads this play closely they will find the gorgeous poetry and subtle humor and vulgarity pleasing, but what is more pleasing to the mature reader is the acute portrayal of young people who think they are in love. The play captures youth so well, in many ways. There is locker room talk between Romeo and his buddies, especially Mercutio. (Mercutio is one of Shakespeare's dirtiest characters, and one of his wittiest.) There is the horny teenager who flits from lust to lust with no thought of consequences, and there is the young girl who makes a serious attempt at very adult decisions. It is all there, and what is more the supporting cast of this play boasts some real genius of character. Lord Capulet is a ferocious father, who has a powerful temper and spirit, and Friar Laurence is one of Shakespeare's most ambiguously motivated creations.One can read this play on the surface level and certainly enjoy it. I think most readers do just that. As do most of the productions I have seen. But there is a dark undercurrent to this play that will ring true with anyone who has ever dealt with that most powerful of emotions. Love. The older I get I am not sure that Romeo and Juliet’s love is surface, as much as it is inexperienced. Might the love be very deep and genuine, but the brain is not yet able to keep up with it? Like Shakespeare's best, “Romeo & Juliet” continues to yield new discoveries on each reading. As we mature in our lives, so does our understanding and appreciation of this play.This edition includes an essay on the performance history of the piece, and interviews with a prominent director (Michael Attenborough) and with actors who have portrayed Romeo & Juliet professionally (David Tennent & Alexandra Gilbreath). It will be of special interest to those who enjoy exploring the multitude of interpretations “Romeo & Juliet” lends itself to. The Modern Library edition also includes a scene-by-scene analysis, which can help point out an image or symbol you might have missed. The edition also includes a nice “Further Readings” list specifically for this play.Frankly, all of the extra essays allow you to dive into the world of the play, and it is all included in one text.The RSC Modern Library editions are a nice new trade paperback with worthwhile extras.

The film is good, the book not so much. Philomena Lee, of the title is completely ignored in the text after page 84 of a 420-page book. From this point on it follows the life of the son she was forced to give up for adoption, Michael Hess. Because the author, Martin Sixsmith, focuses on Michael and obviously takes great liberties with the story I would say this is a novel inspired by a true story, because this book is not nonfiction although labeled as such. This is unfortunate because Ms. Lee was alive and available for interview. The story should have been hers. Michael Hess who the book is really about has been dead since 1995. The amount of stuff the writer clearly makes up is simply egregious. He has detailed and lengthy conversations between people who were both dead before he ever heard of them. These scenes (and there are many) are purely his imagination, nothing else.Mr. Sixsmith hyper focuses on Michael’s life as a semi closeted gay man in the 1970 & 1980s. That drama is interesting to read, again viewing it as fiction, but I am not sure that this is why most readers pick up the text. Mr. Sixsmith portrays Michael Hess as a tortured sexual deviant. Yet he sources nothing. I have a feeling the real person was more three dimensional than the version this text gives. The author is mostly (not always) objective about the Church and the Republican Party, which at times are made to look rather bad in the book. He seems to take pains to not throw the baby out with the bathwater so to speak, and this reader did appreciate that aspect of the text.The story, such as it is, is an interesting one. Unwed Irish mothers forced to work at convents for 3 years, while the church sold off their babies to American adoptive parents. That is the stuff of a good novel.

The chapter is told from Grant’s point of view and gives an interesting insight into the mind of the victor when he respects his enemy. Chapter 53 is simply beautiful. It depicts the events of April 12, 1865 the actual surrender ceremony between the two armies.

It is Joseph Heller’s retelling of the story of the Biblical King David as a bitter old Jewish man facing the end of life without his God and the greatest love of his life (Bathsheba). I will say off the bat that biblical knowledge is a big plus (and possibly also necessary) in order to get the most enjoyment out of this text.The novel is a funny one, and many times while reading I laughed out loud or at least chuckled. Mr. Heller was a good writer. Especially humorous are the conversations between David and his “wise” son Solomon. They are a highlight of the book.Another nice touch are the many anachronisms peppered throughout the text. David refers to 20th century events along with those of very ancient times. It is a clever gambit, as are the insane amount of allusions & lifted lines from many of western literature’s greatest writers. Especially Shakespeare. There were so many lines from his works that I lost count. Other writers whose works I caught (and I am sure there are many I did not) included the Romantic poets, Dickens and others. David constantly complains about how many of the great writers plagiarized him, so the device gives a little bit more enjoyment to the text for the reader who catches them. This also allows for a imaginative moment where we learn the “true” origins of the famous “The Lord is My Shepard” Psalm.However, Heller does get bogged down at times in some mundane details. Chapter 9 of this book is especially hard to endure. The novel is good, but it is a slow read. The text could have lost 50 pages and would have been no worse for it.“God Knows” presents a bitter version of David that some readers might not appreciate. It is not an uplifting book. The ending is biting. A man misses his God, and he misses the love of a woman. It is not a story one would want to live out in their own life. ...more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"Aug 16, 2017","Aug 27, 2017","Aug 16, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10711.God_Knows

This was an interesting choice, as it does force the reader to realize that although one side may be a bit more moral than the other, there are still legitimate grievances on both sides of the issue.“The Kill Artist” suffered from some “too cute” plot devices and some too easily wrapped up plot points, and from a ridiculous scene with Yasir Arafat and the main bad guy in the text, a terrorist named Tariq.

This device allows the reader to take in the massive scope of the story that is being told here in manageable chunks. I hope this style continues thru the series.•	The large arc of the story. Mr. Martin has created a world here, with a complete and rich history.•	The novel is unapologetic. By that, I mean there is rampant sexism, violence, etc. Not pretty elements, but the author is not casting a modern eye on them apologizing for every undesirable trait. This is an ancient world, not like our own. He allows that story to happen without foisting modern sensibilities on it. I appreciate someone just telling a story and letting the actions speak for themselves. You are disgusted or titillated by what the characters are doing based on how you view the world.That is a quick overview, but some of the highlights.

I gave“I am sick of this false world.”“Timon of Athens” is clearly a lesser work of Shakespeare’s, but it is not the horrid play that some say it is. I gave ""Timon of Athens"" a 3 star rating compared to other Shakespeare, not to literature as a whole. The Bard is in a class of his own.Essentially the plot is that Timon is lavish and generous with his wealth, and when he loses it he finds out that he is surrounded by false friends and he descends into pure loathing for humanity and never recovers from those feelings.There really are some excellent moments in this piece, and at times, I found the writing to be stellar. Timon gives a speech in Act 1:2 about friendship that is simply beautiful. The dramatic irony for the reader that he is saying this about people who will never exemplify the virtues of friendship gives it even more power. Act 4:2 contains a touching scene of loyalty and kindness. Flavius (Timon’s steward) is such a decent fellow (again this contrast made even more apparent by false friends) and when the play bogs down in nihilism moments like these will keep you from becoming too depressed. This text also boats the character of Apemantus, one of the funniest cynical philosophers that Shakespeare ever created. A fun character to see a talented actor play.Then we get to Act 4:3, one of the most resentful in all of Shakespeare, and a long scene to boot. Timon (now broke and friendless) rages at the world and its inhabitants. The scene begins and ends in deep bitterness. Timon’s hatred for humanity will depress the reader a little. The scene also contains a long exchange of insults between Timon and Apemantus that would be fun to watch/listen too, but overall it does not lift the mood of the scene.“Timon of Athens” is a good play up until the end of Act 4:3, but after that, it stumbles. Act 5 is confusing, boring, dominated by less than secondary characters and one of the most unsatisfying conclusions in all of Shakespeare.Lovers of Shakespeare should know this piece. Some may like it, as I do. But I can understand why you wouldn’t’.As for the Pelican Shakespeare series, they are my favorite editions since the scholarly research is usually top notch and the editions themselves look good as an aesthetic unit. It looks and feels like a play and this compliments the text's contents admirably. The Pelican series was recently reedited and has the latest scholarship on Shakespeare and his time period.

Although the text is harsh in its assessment of American political moves concerning Vietnam I don’t think it is unnecessarily unfair in most of what it says. The author seems intent on putting blame on every party involved in that conflict, and that willingness to not just make one nation or ideology the villain is a good trait in this book.

His latest book of essays, “But Enough About You” is a collection of his writings from the mid-nineties to about 2012 or so. Most of the pieces were originally published in various magazines or newspapers.This text is broken up into nine sections that serve as thematic “chapters” in which he groups his essays. The Preface of the book (hilarious) and the first section (But Enough About You) start the collection off with a bang. Section 2 (But Seriously) is actually a collection of short fictional humor pieces he wrote for various publications. I chuckled…a lot.Some highlights of the text include his essay “Mr. Lincoln’s Washington” which is a lovely, and at times moving, account of President Lincoln’s last days and his legacy. Eerily enough, he has an essay called “Trump’s Inaugural Speech” written long before the 2016 election and it is prophetic in its tone and satire. (Love or hate Trump, the piece captures him well).Mr. Buckley also has a very serious side, and his essay “Auschwitz” is sobering. It is almost clinical in its style and is a punch in the gut. Buckley also writes lovingly about his pal Christopher Hitchens in many pieces in the text, and the power of that friendship comes through.Like all of Mr. Buckley’s writing, “But Enough About You” makes it obvious that its author is witty, erudite, educated and well read.

Mr. Runyon’s writing style is distinctive, and unlike any other I have encountered. Like Shakespeare, the more of it you read, the more use to it you become. The collection’s stories are all told from a 1st person unnamed narrator’s perspective about the people he knows/meets in the midtown neighborhood of Broadway. All of the stories were written between 1929 and 1944.The collection is very humorous, I laughed out loud often while reading it. This was due mainly to the fact that Runyon is the king of understatement. It is a major component of his writing style, as every story in this collection of 32 has more than a few examples of it. Sentences like, “I do not approve of guys using false pretenses with dolls, except of course, when nothing else will do.” abound in this text. These stories also remind me a lot of the tavern scenes in Shakespeare’s “Henry IV Part I”. The characters are reprobates; the worse society has to offer. However, they are so colorful and good with words that you forget that and have to remind yourself to observe their actions and what they do. By and large they are not good people. There are actually very violent and disturbing aspects to many of these stories. But Runyon’s gift of language dilutes them. The dark elements in this book almost slip by you and the reader must remind themselves from time to time that many of the actions depicted are despicable.Special mention goes out to the story “A Story Goes with It”, one of the best examples of Runyon’s gift of characterization in the piece.I would recommend reading “Guys and Dolls” because there is nothing like it in modern literature.

Maybe it will be, but the ending of the text gives short shrift to the decent characterization that had been crafted up to that point.There are moments/lines in the text that are really stellar.

It includes the obligatory stuff on gender identity that every critic foists on “Twelfth Night”, but also some interesting thoughts on love as it is presented in the play.Long considered Shakespeare’s ""mature"" comedy, ""Twelfth Night"" is the Bard at the top of his comedic game. The multiple subplots are brought together seamlessly in a tidy resolution, for almost everyone, and yet there is enough darkness around the edges of the play to keep it grounded in reality.""Twelfth Night"" also boasts one of the most crowd-pleasing ensembles that Shakespeare ever assembled, and there are numerous roles that all could easily be reader/audience favorites. Personally, I always enjoy reading the wonderful scenes of Malvolio, a puritanical steward, and the drunk and somewhat malicious Sirs Toby Belch and Andrew Aguecheek. Shakespeare gives these three characters some of the best moments in the play, and it is also through them that all the subplots are brought together.Do not be fooled though, this play is not just laughs. It is tinged with dark moments that remind the reader of the cruelties and vagaries of love, deception, and revenge. As with most of Shakespeare's work, there is more here than meets the eye of the casual observer.Shakespeare's knack for accurate human characterization never ceases to amaze me, and this text boats many wonderful characters that would make an acting company salivate. I come back to this wonderful work repeatedly and on this particular read the small role of Antonio stood out to me. He has some beautiful lines/moments, and his loyalty was especially endearing to me.The famous opening line of this play says, ""If music be the food of love, play on..."".”Twelfth Night"" has been playing on for over 400 years, and it is still has something to say to us. Find good theatre companies doing a performance of it after reading it and you will get even more enjoyment out of this wonderful text. This edition includes an essay on the performance history of the piece, and interviews with three prominent directors (Sam Mendes, Declan Donnellan & Neil Bartlett). It will be of special interest to those who enjoy exploring the multitude of interpretations “Twelfth Night” lends itself to. The Modern Library edition also includes a scene-by-scene analysis, which can help point out an image or symbol you might have missed. The edition also includes a nice “Further Readings” list specifically for this play.Frankly, all of the extra essays allow you to dive into the world of the play, and it is all included in one text.The RSC Modern Library editions are a nice new trade paperback with worthwhile extras.

I never seem to remember what happens in this book, but each time I return to it I enjoy it.This novel explores the mystery of the song of the humpback whale and Mr. Moore's explanation of it is oddly touching and satisfying for the reader.Having read all of Christopher Moore's novels, one of the things I like most about ""Fluke"" in contrast to some of his later works is that the humor is more subtle and not as vulgar and slapsticky, which in turn means it is more clever, and in my mind, enjoyable.""Fluke"" is a novel divided into three parts, and Part One of the novel is an interesting aquatic story, dealing with scientists and humpback whale research. Then we get to Part Two and the book takes a fantastical and unexpected turn that many readers did not appreciate. Although I did not see the abrupt tone change in the text coming, it did not disturb me as much as it did other readers. Despite the ridiculous elements that Moore weaves into the book, beginning with Part Two, the novel works as a unit and hangs nicely in the balance between realism and crazy fantasy.On this rereading I also greatly enjoyed the character of Clay Demodocus, whose loyalty and personality are a highlight of the text.Another thing I noticed on this reading more than I did in past ones are the rather important questions it poses (although briefly) from time to time on the nature of creation/creator/design/evolution. These are not minor themes, and Mr. Moore touches on them with a delicate and I think respectful of all sides decency.The resolution of the novel is a little too tidy, but I wanted it to be, and I freely admit I would have been irritated had it not been so. This was my third reading of ""Fluke"" as this was the first Christopher Moore book I ever read, and it lead me to all of his others.

I believe that the series is worth your time to read if you have a preexisting interest in the subject.“The Fateful Lightning” is really General Sherman’s book. It begins with his leaving Atlanta after its capture and concludes with the surrender of Joe Johnston’s army in late April of 1865. Per his usual style, the book is written in alternating viewpoints from a few character’s point of view. Each chapter is a first person account from its narrator. Other than William T. Sherman, no other character really registers consistently in the novel. I think that General Sherman is one of the better characters (in terms of how he is written) that Mr. Shaara has created so I did not mind this.A quibble with the text, Mr. Shaara clearly cannot write woman characters. When they show up and speak it is not very authentic or interesting. Oddly enough, the second book in this series did have a compelling female character as one of its alternating narrators. Not sure what happened here? There are also a few moments where slavery appears to be whitewashed, but stick with it. The evil of slavery is not whitewashed at all; Mr. Shaara is just presenting it in its historical context without judging. I appreciated that approach. It speaks for itself, and the author does not (and did not) have to condemn it in modern terms. As the novel progresses, it clearly condemns itself.The book bears out the enormity of the Civil War with an unexpected subtlety in its final chapters that is quite good. It is appropriate and well done.Overall, the novels in this series are not great. They are good, at times very good, and I read them all quickly.

He writes books about things you did not know that you needed to know. “Mornings on Horseback” is yet another example of a book about a subject matter I thought I would have no interest in, but I was very wrong.This text is about Teddy Roosevelt’s immediate family and his upbringing. It ends in the mid-1880s right after his second marriage. He is all of 28 years old, and the more “famous” aspects of his life are not even addressed. Moreover, it is utterly absorbing reading. It is also a bit of a social history on American Victorian life and is endlessly insightful on that subject.McCullough makes it very clear that our immediate family are some of the biggest influences on who we are to become and Teddy’s parents and siblings are a fascinating and very accomplished family. You will fall in love with Teddy’s daddy (Theodore Roosevelt senior) who was an extraordinary man. His death in the text will deflate the reader for a bit. And it sneaks up on you, as do many aspects of the book. In this manner, the writer remains true to the spirit of life. Things just happen; no preparation for them is given. The insight you get into the man Teddy became is clearly apparent the more you learn about his amazing father and mother.Among many highlights of the book are pages 349/350, which contain a speech Teddy Roosevelt gave at a 4th of July celebration in the Dakotas in 1886.

If you are a fan of Mr. Cumming (full disclosure, I have seen him in very little) and are thinking this book is a celebrity autobiography, it isn’t. It focuses on two incidents in his life, his relationship with his father, and his search for information about his enigmatic maternal grandfather. The book is really two narratives: one being abut Alan’s awful relationship with his dad, not told chronologically, but in bits and pieces much like memory, and the second narrative dealing with his learning about his grandfather, Tommy Darling (told mostly chronologically). The two stories are intermixed throughout the text.The book gets redundant after a while. Mr. Cumming is always “exhausted” or “drained” by the issues he is confronted with. They are difficult issues, but not more so than what most people have to deal with, and after a while the navel gazing gets to be a little much. I would have preferred more focus on the issues themselves, and a little less on the author telling us how tired all this made him. The text makes it obvious Cumming can be high maintenance, and I kept thinking to myself how difficult it must be to be really close to him.There are good moments in the piece, don’t get me wrong.

There are a few too many typos in this edition to “Three Plays” is an excellent collection of three works by that most sardonic of wits, Noel Coward. There are a few too many typos in this edition to suit me, but that it is a minor quibble.I have written something about each of the 3 pieces below, separated by a quote from each play.For those who like verbal dexterity, witty dialogue, and a play that you must pay attention to in order to appreciate, then Mr. Coward is your man. Enjoy!“I shall always love the memory of you.”Noel Coward was one of the drollest writers the stage has ever produced. His ability to write smart, extremely verbal and witty characters is almost as fun to read as it is to witness in performance.“Blithe Spirit” is one of Coward’s more famous pieces, and the premise is clever and intriguing. In brief, a successful writer has a séance in his home in order to observe a Madame for research for his latest novel. The séance results in his dead wife (Elvira) returning from the grave, and only he can see her. This causes problems with the current (very much alive) wife Ruth. This play is a comedy, and the dialogue is fast and furious. I could not help but observe as I read it, and saw it in performance in an excellent production at the Stratford Festival, that the arguments between the character of Ruth and her husband are some of the best moments in the piece. Their conversations are quick, biting, comical and sometimes so subtly mean spirited that it is a delight to read. The whole play is well paced and fun, but Coward really excels in the moments when just two characters share the stage and for whatever reason they are not happy with each other.A personal favorite for me is the character of Ruth, who in the hands of a weak actress becomes shrill and one note. But if you pay attention she is not written that way, and some of the text’s best moments belong to her.Noel Coward is a throwback to a time we imagine was more witty and urbane. It probably wasn’t, but it is fun to imagine it was so.“Her sense of the theater is always fatal.”“Hay Fever” is just a funny funny play. It has the witty banter and intelligent characters that one expects in a text from Noel Coward, but it is really a farce, with physical elements, and characters who are so self-involved that they could become parodies in the hands of a lesser writer, or in the case of bad actors.The play follows a weekend at the country home of the Bliss family, each member of which has invited a weekend guest. And with that we are off to the races. The Bliss family are people who really can’t see past the end of their own noses and the havoc they wreck on others is either cruel, or the result of a complete lack of self-awareness. It is probably a mixture of both.I saw a top notch professional performance of this piece at the Stratford Festival in Ontario Canada, and the audience was laughing from beginning to end. It is also fun to read, but I read it after seeing it performed, so perhaps that enhanced my reading of it?The final line of this piece is one of the most appropriate and ironic closing lines I have ever read in a play. A perfect closing.I have read three Noel Coward plays, and this one kept my attention the most as I was reading. Many people don’t know “Hay Fever” well. If you are one of those people you should change that.“I think very few people are completely normal, really deep down in their private lives.”I read “Private Lives” as the last of three plays that I read in a row by Noel Coward, and I have to say of the three it was my last favorite. Still quite good, but a little darker than the other two I had just read. A little more aged and perhaps too rooted in its original time. I not sure why, but this piece is not as engaging as Coward’s “Blithe Spirit” and “Hay Fever”. I have never seen “Private Lives” in a professional performance, and I have seen excellent productions of the other two, so that might be a factor.In this text, we meet Amanda and Elyot, a divorced couple who run into each other on their honeymoons for their respective second marriages. What should be a comic farcical gem, turns instead into a dark comedy where two people who really should not be together, and are cruel to each other (and always will be by every indication) get together again. It just left a bitter taste in my mouth.“Private Lives” is a good play, seeing it in performance it could be funnier than it reads, but just reading it left me cold....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jan 31, 2017","Feb 05, 2017","Jan 31, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/370966.Three_Plays

I was not drawn into the novel for the first 100 pages or so, my feelings on the book were ambivalent, but by the time I finished it I really enjoyed it. Don’t get me wrong, the text is not ever really bad, but the vulgarity was more irritating to me than Robbins usually is, and the book does not employ as much unique figurative language as one can expect from Tom Robbins, although there is a ton compared to other writers. The use of language is still unique and clever but it was not as standout a facet of the text to me as in other Robbins novels.The first chapter, called “Single Cell Preface” is just fun and clever and starts you off smiling in expectation. Other highlights include a chapter that is a conversation between the brain and a thumb. It is worth a reread. And lines like, “Cursing the chemical Calvinism that causes alcohol to make us suffer for the good time it gives us” are one of the main joys of reading Tom Robbins. Who can’t enjoy the brilliant juxtaposition of language and the clever (and totally apropos) use of allusions? Mr. Robbins always rewards readers who know stuff, and I adore that about him.Others joys of the text are the occasional lines that pop out that encompass wisdom and human truth, and usually in service of the story. An example you ask…”We only pollute our own waters when we try to extend our true affection to those who don’t know how to accept love or to give it.” Wow! And like most of Robbins novels there are more than a few moments like that in this text.Overall, “Even Cowgirls Get the Blues” is a good novel, and I don’t find myself agreeing with those who charge it as sexist, and too philosophical. I think they projected some things on the text that the writer does not intend, but hey such is the reader’s’ prerogative....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jan 13, 2017","Jan 27, 2017","Jan 13, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/623675.Even_Cowgirls_Get_the_Blues

The novel moves quickly, although it covers a span of two years it is only 262 pages. Things happen, big things, without any fanfare, as they do for all of us, every day in real life.The novel’s protagonist, Ellis Lacey, is so fully rendered that you almost immediately sense that you know her (probably you just recognize a bit of yourself) within the first few pages of the text. The way Mr. Toibin puts us in her head moves the novel along. When Ellis goes on her first date with an Italian named Tony that she recently met at a dance I was stunned by the great writing. It was astounding, and romantic.

It is not a particularity deep text; in fact it demonstrates a very shallow understanding of Christianity, especially the teachings of Christ. If Christ made a rule, Mr. Miller apparently does not believe he actually meant one to follow it. The author also seems determined to be “cool” by constantly elevating those of a liberal/ant-Christian bent against those of Christian evangelicals or fundamentalists. Sure, he occasionally says that his thinking that way is wrong, but he knocks those of a conservative religious bent enough that I think his very weak attempts to say that those of a more conservative faith are not bad people seems forced. His own intolerance still comes through, and that hypocrisy was galling to me. Especially bad was chapter 11, titled “Confession”. I disliked it for two reasons. #1-It rings false. I would not be a bit surprised if he made most of it up. #2-Spirituality is not a substitute for a walk with Christ. Jesus was pretty adamant (and clear) about that. Miller is more than entitled to his beliefs, but to pass it off as a substitute equal to what Christ explicitly taught is a bit much. Again, the arrogance and self-righteousness comes out of the writing in spades, and Mr. Miller is a big fan of pointing that out in others. In an attempt to be “cool”, he becomes irrelevant. On page 210 of the text he has to gall to say that the Christian communities he has belonged to had unwritten rules and social strictures, but the ultra-liberal college he attended was a bastion of love and acceptance and no social strictures at all. That is a huge lie. Every social group has unwritten social mores and codes. Every. Single. One. Someone who does not know that much about humanity should not be writing a book to instruct others. I could point out a ton of moments like this in the text. For the sake of space, trust me on this one.There are some nice moments and thoughts in this piece, hence the two star rating. The chapter called “Grace” was interesting and had some real insights on God’s grace and the role it plays in Christian life. Unfortunately, when Miller makes a good point, he follows it up with such irritating comments & observations that it becomes irrelevant. I am not setting myself up as better, or more qualified than him. However, I also have the humility to know that my spiritual walk is not one to put on a pedestal and share out.

The concept for the novel itself is almost genius, and the execution of that concept is no mean feat, and Mr. Heller pulls it off nicely.It is amazing how this novel, published in 1988, feels like it was written yesterday about very current events. It just goes to show you how much history is a cycle of events and how much Western Civilization (and all civilization) just rotate through the same stories again and again. Page 101 of this text is literally a description of the current political leadership in the western world. Eerily prescient.One of the greatest joys of this novel is its style. The book contains some irony, and then more irony and more irony mixed in with sarcasm and dry dark humor, and even more irony. It abounds, and is delivered in such a manner that it does not seem to be overkill. There were more than a few times while reading this text that I was reminded of reading Kurt Vonnegut.Some highlights of the book included “Section VII: Biography” which is brilliant. It is a history lesson, satire of modern life and good reading and writing all in one. A real joy. “Section XV: The Last Laugh” is a clever overview of Western Civilization told while explaining the journey that Rembrandt’s painting “Aristotle Contemplating a Bust of Homer” took from its original owner in the mid-1600s to its current home at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in NYC.A couple of examples of some of the wit in this text include one of the truest things I’ve ever read in a novel; “A middle aged man with a theory to which he has long been attached grows less interested in whether it is true and more obsessed that it be accepted as true…” and the biting and also very accurate “That property owned in common by all of the people is owned by none of the people but belongs to the government.” I mean seriously folks, that is some major truth right there!I first read “Picture This” 16 years ago, and remember liking it. Although the last couple of chapters drag a little in comparison to those that precede them, the novel is exceptional. I was worried that my opinion of the text would change and not for the better.

I was especially intrigued by the parts of the text dealing with Salmon Chase, who I knew only the most rudimentary things about. I will leave it to other readers to render their own verdict about him.There are many strengths to this text, and one leaves it with an appreciation for just how much Lincoln and his closest advisers carried on their shoulders.

It was the 16th in his Gabriel Allon series, and I liked it so much I went back to the first book and began reading. Now I am back up to number 16 while I’m reading through the series in order. This is the one that started it all for me. Having read my way “back” to it, I clearly see why it captured me those years ago. Initially I picked this book up because I heard a TV commentator mention how prescient it was with what was going on the world today. And sadly, it is.Although a fictional thriller, this novel opens with ISIS terror attacks in Paris that are too real for comfort and the novel is unflinching in its portrayal of radical Islam and its ultimate goal of recreating an Islamic caliphate. Silva does not shy away from placing the blame for the current state of affairs on American foreign policy (especially the invasion of Iraq in 2003) and he is equally candid in his assessment of the Obama administration’s policy failures when it came to terrorism, and their weakness in the face of the rise of ISIS. He knits those views into the plot of the novel pretty seamlessly, and at times you have to remind yourself this is fiction.I was actually surprised (those years ago) at how decently the novel is written. Characterization is (for the most part) pretty adept and Silva’s writing is good, to the point, and his ability to plot out this novel is pretty stellar. It is sprawling in scope, and Silva handles the myriad locales with a deft hand. I read the book pretty quickly, and found myself wanting to return to it to see what came next. Although over 500 pages, it is an intense read. Pulse pounding actually. ISIS is the worst of humanity and Mr. Silva has no problem showing them for what they are, the worst of the worst.Quotes:•	“And difficult things are almost always accomplished entirely in secret.”•	“It’s not often we are given a second chance at happiness.”Despite the fact that the novel is a bit of a dark read, it does end with a sense of hope. The good guys will fight on. That is the stuff of movies, and hopefully of reality. Its ending however leads me to believe that Mr. Silva intends to continue another frame of the story in the next novel of the series. The story does not quite feel complete.THE BLACK WIDOW is entertaining (and at times not pleasant) reading. The novel is unflinching in its support for fighting radical Islam, honestly says what Western Civilization is up against, and evenhanded in its assessment of Israeli policy (Silva is not a shill for Israel as some s have claimed).

A story of a man who is bisexual, living from the mid-1940s to the early 2000s. A lot has changed in the world, especially for gay people, in that time frame. It is a topic rich with possibilities. This novel does not meet them. The book is massively redundant. Irving repeats himself in this text, a lot. I did not see it as part of the narrator’s characterization, so what was the point? Another fail are the last 50 pages, or so. The novel descends into intolerant tolerance and is just preachy, and for lack of better words, stupid and smug. Irving seems to want to end his novel making a “point”, instead of ending the story in a manner true to the characters and the world of the novel. Yet another gripe is that there are too many unrealistic moments in the text. Everyone that the narrator feared in high school, or had a mild crush on, or at least partly knew is either gay, a transsexual, or some other form of “out of the norm”. Come on Irving. The narrator is bisexual, that does not mean that everyone he knows also has some form of sexual difference. There is also a completely unexplained, dropped in ghost element to the text that does not seem to serve any purpose. I could go on, but I won’t.That is not to say that the book is all bad. It did keep my attention, although I’m not sure why. There are also moments in the text (alas only moments, a sentence or two here and there) that spoke to me and had some profundity and truth to them. I also found the part of the novel where the narrator deals with and lives through the AIDS crisis of the 1980s to be especially gripping and well done. Irving seems to capture the devastation of that time for the gay community. There are also a couple of well-developed characters in the text, although oddly not the ones that Irving spends the most time on.I wish “In One Person” had been a better novel.

Mr. Bean has taken a lot of s*#t because his version is vulgar, full of doody jokes, and maybe too common for some in the academic community. However, I feel his version is very true to the original intent of Moliere and the updates are merely imitations of what Moliere would do if he were alive today. And that is fine and dandy.I read the text in one afternoon and it is funny. Laugh out loud funny at times. The roles are one dimensional for the most part, but in the hands of a good company of actors they are a delight. The most enjoyable to read are the hypochondriac of the title, Argan, his scheming wife Beline, and his maid Toinette. They have the wittiest dialogue and some of the play’s better moments. The character through which the audience hears the truth is in the form of Argan’s brother Beralde, and through him the play’s morals and wisdom are passed to the reader.What can I say, “The Hypochondriac” is fun.

I picked up the book because I read the awesome first paragraph and was intrigued. And I read every page of this 936-page tome. But it is not great writing, in fact sometimes it is downright awful. And the protagonist is so full of self-importance that you want to punch him. But I read it, all of it, and although I did not love it, I did not hate it, and I don’t regret reading it.First, the bad. The author, Gregory David Roberts, writes at times in such a pretentious didactic tone that you want to scream. It comes across like Mr. Roberts wants to impress the reader with how deep and smart he is. He also has no skill, and I do mean none, for writing figurative language. I laughed out loud at times at some of his truly awful figurative prose. There are times his writing could be used as a parody of bad high school creative writing class examples. My last major complaint is that the last half of the book, although holding my attention, drifts into the unbelievable, with the protagonist (Australian escaped ex con Lin) being thrust into one action adventure scenario after another.Now on to the good. There are times in the novel when I did not want to stop reading. The narrative does propel you forward. And although the last half of the book is unbelievable, it is also sprawling and epic, and you don’t come across much reading like that nowadays, and I enjoyed that aspect of it. Another strength of the text is the obvious love the author has for India, its people, and Bombay in particular. For cultural enhancement alone the book is a valuable read. Roberts goes into detail (sometimes too much detail) about the most mundane things about Indian culture. I was fascinated by that. There are also individual lines and musings in this text that pop up from time to time that are simply put, quite amazing and worthy of reading and thinking about again long after the novel is finished. Roberts does have a deep mind, I just wish he had let it flow organically and not felt the need to “impress” the reader. These moments of truth throughout the text are much more powerful than any of the forced moments where the author is telegraphing to the reader that there is something “to get” here.“Shantaram” …I don’t regret the time I spent with it.

I was correct in that assumption. Reading it made me appreciate the performance I had seen even more.The libretto (book) by Hugh Wheeler is one of the best I have encountered in a musical. Good characterization, a nice flow from scene to scene, and unlike the book of many musicals, the story feels complete with the songs, not merely a tool for them.Something that I noticed in reading “A Little Night Music” that I did not catch fully in performance is the juxtaposition of the two scenes, which follow one another that contain the songs “Send in the Clowns” and “The Miler’s Son.” It is brilliant. The former scene/song explores the idea of not taking what you need/want when it is presented to you and being passed by and made a fool (or clown). The scene/song “The Miler’s Son” is just the opposite. Life will make a fool of you from time to time, so you have to jump at any chance and happiness that you can get when presented. This thematic device is simply presented in very effective dialogue, and in the two most profound lyrics/songs of the piece.Read “A Little Night Music” and then see a good production.

The narrator of the text is a man looking back at what we first are led to believe are some innocuous memories of his young adult life. But like most things in life, there is more to most events than what we allow ourselves to remember. For instance, at one point the narrator talks about being damaged, how we all are, and what it does to each of us. (This is on page 48 in the paperback) It is a wonderfully adept human point, and one that made me stop and get into my head, perhaps more than I wanted to be? The author, Julian Barnes, captures in moments such as these the scope of our humanity.However, after this remarkable beginning the book lags dramatically, and the narration and plotting get very redundant. The text drags as a consequence. Another part of the novel I could not get into was the character of Veronica. She is the girlfriend of the narrator’s college years and she is a very unlikable character. I’m talking a very unpleasant specimen. I truly disliked her, and had no sympathy for her. I think Barnes wants the reader to see her point of view a little I and was just not interested in her enough to do so.The good news is that the last 10 pages pick up again, and the ending is one that I did not anticipate playing out in the manner in which it did. At only 163 pages the novel is a quick read, and as a consequence its flaws did not bother me like they would in a 500-page book.The profundity in “The Sense of an Ending” is in how well Julian Barnes captures the tricks we use with memory in order to validate the self-image we create of ourselves and our story.

Written from the point of Greg’s libertarian leanings he does a great job at jabbing back at the “tolerant” (massively intolerant) left and how they use coercion of personality and fitting in to suppress anything they don’t like. This happens on a daily basis to me, a social liberal and political conservative whose lifestyle does not fit easily into one camp or another. I actually had an “intellectual” tell me my life choices where “disappointing” because I do not vote the way he does. Arrogance & idiocy does not even begin to describe people like that. And therein lies the joy of “Not Cool”. Gutfeld fights back and on the same ground as those who talk that way. He calls names, he dismisses them as foolish although not inconsequential, he still recognizes their humanity, and for those of us tired of being talked down to in a condescending manner it is fun to see someone punch back.Some highlights of the text include the chapter “Treating Crazies like Daisies” about the issues with the mentally ill. It is spot on, and good on Greg for taking on this topic that most people refuse to acknowledge as a serious issue. Especially in regards to gun violence. Other high points include “The War on Warriors” dealing with the emasculation of the military and the culture in general and the chapter “Southern Discomfort” which raises very interesting points about the stereotypes we foist on the South. I had to stop and examine some of my perceptions after reading that chapter, lest I be like the very people I can’t stand. Their hypocrisy is enough; I don’t need to join them.In a chapter I could have done without Gutfeld talks about who he finds cool. The list is a nice collection of people who don’t let popular culture dictate their beliefs and values, but it has a large proportion of heavy metal musicians that Greg likes. Nothing wrong with that, just an odd way to lead into the text’s conclusion.Approach “Not Cool” for what it is, and if you are one of the folks maligned by the culture because you don’t fit into their box, enjoy someone fighting right back at them.

His take on it is to examine Shakespeare’s life, time, and works through the lenses of his famous “7 Ages of Man” speech from his play “As You Like It”. An intriguing idea, but not one that I am sure comes across as completely successful in this text.First off, this is not a biography for the casual reader of Shakespeare. This book assumes a certain amount of knowledge of Shakespeare’s work, and of the historical period of his life in general. If you are not already inclined to be interested in Shakespeare, this text will not create that interest in you.As someone who usually devours most things Shakespeare related, I have to admit that the first 146 pages of this book just dragged for me. They are tedious at best. Mr. Bate examines what educational and literary influences the young Shakespeare would have encountered and it is a lot of Latin and Greek, and frankly just too much of it for me to care. Interesting thoughts are presented here, but they are at best conjecture, and thus not as important as Bate seems to emphasize. The author states too many times that such and such a book Shakespeare would have no knowledge of, or that he would not have owned a copy of this or that book. Mr. Bate, you (we) don’t know! Period. Which you acknowledge when you point out theories about Shakespeare from others that you don’t agree with. “Physician, heal thyself”. There is a bit of conjecture in this text, which any book about Shakespeare will have. I don’t mind that, usually. In this book, it bothered me. Maybe because the author rarely admitted when he was doing it?When we get to the third age of man (Lover) the text picks up in earnest and I began reading with an eagerness and interest. The book keeps this momentum going (for the most part) from this point in the text to the end.I’m glad I read “Soul of the Age”. Mr. Bate is an intelligent and close reader of Shakespeare.

Are our expectations too high, or should people live up to the standard that others set for them? Arthur Miller does not give us an answer (of course) but there are moments in this drama that get us pretty close.Like a lot of Miller “All My Sons” deals with a father and son relationship that can never meet the burden of expectation BOTH father and son have put on it. In this manner it resembles “Death of a Salesman” quite a bit. The play is written in three acts. A simple structure: first act sets up the characters and relationships, second act lets us in on the dramatic issue of the play, third act shows us how the characters we have come to know deal with the issue revealed in Act 2.I don’t want to give away any plot points. I was lucky enough to pick up this play knowing very little about it. I won’t ruin that for others here. However, I will say that for an actor and reader the Keller family (the main protagonists of the play) come across as characters with dimension and depth. Mr. Miller has written some great roles here, with a lot of unspoken issues for actors to play with. This text is a quick read, but one that will creep up on you.

And having read more than a few of his novels, I think it is also one of his better efforts. Shaara seems to have hit his stride as a writer with this text. The dialogue (usually one of the worst aspects of his novels) is much improved in this effort. It is not brilliant, but it is better than a lot of historical fiction out there. As usual, Shaara is best when writing scenes of battle and the firsthand experience of war from the perspective of those engaged in it. His writing enters the minds of the fighting men during such moments. There are times in this novel, especially during the first Federal attack at Vicksburg, that are simply harrowing to read.Another highlight of the text is the characterization Shaara has utilized for William Tecumseh Sherman. He continues in this book the characterization he began in its predecessor, “A Blaze of Glory”, of Sherman as a man plagued by fears and doubt contrasting with the duties of war. The dichotomy of Sherman’s public persona and his inner turmoil really highlights his humanity and is an engaging choice.There are two more novels in this series, and I will be reading them.

In it he makes a lovely point that although it reeks of modern influences (taking the play out of context) I had never thought to consider.This is a Shakespeare play that I did not much care for when I first read it years ago, but I have since become quite fond of. It is one of Shakespeare's mature comedies, written at the height of his prowess around 1599. It also boats the largest female Shakespearean role, Rosalind, and has a supporting cast that is well defined, and compliments the plays themes quite nicely.""As You like It"" contains one of Shakespeare's most famous monologues, the ""Seven Ages of Man"" speech spoken by the melancholy member of court Jacques. However, it also boats many other moments of pleasure. Act 2:7 is one of the most profound and beautiful scenes in all of Shakespeare, and that is saying something! The highlight of the play is the third act, which is a delight of imagery and witty dialogues throughout. Act 3:2 seems to touch on a bit of everything and is in a word, delightful! The play hits it thematic and comedic stride in this act, and propels the action to its dizzying assortment of marriages in the conclusion.This text also boats more songs than any other Shakespeare play, and like all of Shakespeare's work it has dark undertones to many of its more rustic elements. Both serve to enhance the text and make it a more enjoyable experience.Shakespeare's knack for accurate human characterization never ceases to amaze me, and this text boats many wonderful characters that would make an acting company salivate.

And his instincts are correct.Besides the main narrative about the sinking of the “Essex”, the island of Nantucket and its inhabitants and culture are a significant aspect of the book. Philbrick clearly demonstrates how you cannot fully examine the one without understanding the other. In short, “In the Heart of the Sea” is a gripping and informative read in the vein of the best narrative nonfiction. I enjoyed it immensely.

The author of the Commentary (and the novel’s narrator) is Dr. Charles Kinbote whose morality, identity and authority are questionable throughout the entire text.The novel is divided into a Forward-the actual poem Pale Fire-the Commentary on the poem-and finally an Index. I read the novel linearly from page one to the end. You could read it by flipping back and forth between the Commentary and the poem, but you would be wasting your time, as the Commentary really has nothing to do with the poem it is supposed to be commenting on.The novel lends itself to a myriad of interpretations, none of which I am going to examine here. Do that for yourself, I don’t want to foist an interpretation on you.The biggest strength of “Pale Fire” is the characterization of its narrator by Vladimir Nabokov. I had read only a few pages of the Forward and Dr. Kinbote was clearly established as a real person, and he is a great character. I would have no desire to know him, but he is most certainly real. He is a delusional and very lonely man, desperately in need of companionship. And in some traits he is like most of us, and probably not in a manner we are comfortable with.“Pale Fire” is an intriguing and very different read.

However, in his hands it is a wonderful narrative history that manages to be about many things, and all at the same time.This text is about the American artists, diplomats, writers, doctors, etc. who populated Paris France during the 19th century. Beginning with the early 1800s and concluding essentially at the dawn of the 1900s McCullough gives us a readable and very fascinating history of “Americans in Paris” (as the subtitle says) but also really a history of Paris in the 19th century, which was one of endless change and action in the French capitol. There are more than a dozen good “stories” and interesting lives that are explored in this text, and they are given a quick, but not surface, treatment in the book. “The Greater Journey” is a historical parade through a century of French and American culture. The biggest character in the book is Paris itself, and McCullough makes a city that is long gone (the 19th century Paris that is) come vibrantly alive. He also does an excellent job of making parts of French history that most Americans probably know little about (the Franco Prussian War, the back and forth of monarchy, dictatorship & republic, etc.) relevant and very very interesting.McCullough understands better than most historical writers out there that history is about people, not events. The events are shaped by the people who participated in them, but you have to know the people as flesh and blood or history is dead. Some great examples in this book of history coming alive through the people he writes about include his wonderful section on the American Minister to France Elihu Wasburne and his focus on the sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens. Just two among many I could cite in this text.I have now read five of David McCullough’s books and I have yet to be disappointed.

However, it is an uneven book, with the first part much stronger than the latter.This memoir basically chronicles Augusten’s path to married life and deals with three relationships that seem to have made him the man he is today. There are moments where anyone who has been in a serious long term relationship will cringe with recognition, and that is a good thing.Be warned, Mr. Burroughs does not come off as especially likable in this text. In fact, I would say he is not at all likable. His comments about his past relationships are of course only one side of the story, and although he self-deprecates plenty in the text, I never noticed him taking real credit for his part in their demise. That is not a good or bad thing, it just is. Remember you are only getting one perspective. His ex (Dennis) really gets the rough treatment in this text, and frankly I think both of them made their relationship the mess it became.Once Burroughs settles on the man who will become his husband (Christopher) the book slows down a lot, dealing with the minutia of married life. And that is okay. A contented life should not be all that crazy, in fact it should be downright everyday (or boring as the disingenuous would say).“Lust and Wonder” has moments of great human truth in it, and I appreciated and enjoyed this quick read....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"May 22, 2016","May 28, 2016","May 22, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25663652-lust-wonder

Mr. Stoll quotes others in this book…a lot! There are times when the book seems to be one quotation after another. He will often quote entire letters, sermons, etc. and it breaks up the narrative (as already mentioned). However, often times the quotes are primary sources.

It did not bug me as much as it appears to have irritated some other readers. Maybe because the book is not that long. A wise choice on the author and editor’s part.The text is well researched (clearly) and has a nice “Notes” and Bibliography section.

And it stinks too!Under the guise of a medieval mystery Umberto Eco has written a diatribe on philosophical ideas (and not presented all of them accurately) in order to impress upon the reader how very smart he is indeed. Characterization, moments of human reality & truth, and most importantly accessibility to the reader are clearly repulsive ideas to Mr. Eco.I can sum up the book, which takes place at a monastery in northern Italy in 1327 thus: -Monks have crazy visions, lots of them and their visions don’t advance the plot one iota.-Umberto Eco knew Latin, and he wants you to be damn sure to know it.-The narrator has a vison in which Eco shows off that he knows Bible stories, lots of them, and can throw them into a blender to create some post-apocalyptic nonsense, again to no point in the story. My mommy read Bible stories to me too. I get the references Eco was making. I imagine that would disappoint him. He clearly hates novels that actually involve the reader.-Eco is actually a very bad version of Dan Brown. Read that sentence again. Yep I said it. The text’s great dénouement is straight out of one of Brown’s novels with the same obvious villain/ religious fanatic that the reader can see coming a mile away. Mr. Brown can’t write, but he is a good storyteller. Eco can’t write (and editing is out of his frame of reference) AND he is a horrid storyteller.-The arrogant and meandering “Postscript” written by the author (he takes 40 pages to explain to you how great he and his book are) is truly terrible. It will make you detest the writer. As if you will need help after finishing this torture. Did no one ever tell this guy to shut up? Throughout these 40 pages he contradicts himself, and talks down to the reader too many times to count.Really my biggest frustration with “The Name of the Rose” is that it infrequently presents an interesting idea which if followed up would have made for intriguing reading. Among them, the idea of “books speaking among themselves” and some thoughts on the nature of learning that had much potential. There are nuggets throughout the text that if taken out of context are quite insightful and worthy of thought. But then Eco’s ego gets the better of him and he pontificates and belabors each point he makes. Every time he presents an idea (philosophical, educational, religious or other) he makes the point in 2-3 pages and then goes on to lecture the reader for another 10-20 pages on the same point redundantly. If those redundancies alone had been cut the text would have been 300 pages and significantly less bad.A member of my book club picked this text, and the way the meeting for this book went clearly demonstrates its flaws. It was not a discussion and an exchange of ideas, but a lecture. When you have a group of educated people and 1 or 2 has to tell the rest of them how valuable a text is…well…I think that says it all right there. Ironically Eco writes in the book “Without an eye to read them, a book contains signs that produce no concepts, therefore it is dumb.” Unless you are a book by Mr. Eco of course, then if people don’t read your work because it does not speak to them they are the fools. There are quite a few fans of this text who may believe that whopper.

He discusses the ambiguity of the nature of Henry’s character, and how this Henry fits with the Prince Hal of the “Henry IV” plays. A historical view of the real Henry is also intriguing. I give ""Henry V"" a 4-star rating compared to other Shakespeare, not to literature as a whole. The Bard is in a class of his own.Act 1 of this perennial favorite is only exposition, letting the audience see Henry receive justification for his impending invasion of France. It may appear to be dull, but read closely. There is a lot there. Also, it ends on a high note with a great exchange between Henry and the French ambassador.There are numerous highlights of the play, but my mind is especially drawn to Act 4:1 when Henry walks in disguise among his troops on the eve of battle. Shakespeare gives us the perspectives of the leaders and common soldiers during a war, and he arouses our sympathy for both. An interesting thing I observed was how even in war and battle the obsession with class distinction that was a hallmark of that period in English history is pervasive throughout the text, reminding us that Shakespeare was indeed a product of his time. It seems ridiculous to the modern reader, but in context it is not out of place at all. Act 5:2 is another high point for the play where we get to see Henry's blunt, and I think honest, attempt to woo Katherine. It is humorous for its self-deprecation and awkwardness which any person who hates the game of flirtation and dating will understand and appreciate. Some things simply transcend time.Henry V is the perfect Machiavellian, especially in Act 4:3 when he delivers the iconic ""St Crispian's Day"" speech. The speech is really a bold faced lie with the king telling the common soldiers who will die in his war that they are ""noble"" and ""his brothers"", when really they are shedding blood to increase his power base. Or is he a patriotic hero and a lover of England? Like most good leaders, Shakespeare seems to be saying that he is both. You read this speech and you know you are being manipulated, yet your blood cannot help but quicken.The best drawn, and really only complex characters in the text are Henry, Fluellen, and perhaps the shady Pistol. Though all three are vastly different: one a consummate politician, one a simple loyal loudmouth, and the last a deceitful and ""me first"" vagabond, we see that actually these three characters share these qualities with each other, and the only thing that separates them is that one of the qualities is more pronounced in one than the other two. An interesting point being is being made here by the author.Finally, I love the Chorus who begins each act with begging the audience's pardon for the dramatic license being taken with the historical story, and who then fills in many blanks that the reader does not get to witness first hand. The appeals the Chorus makes to the audience's imagination is what all dramatic literature should strive to do, and I enjoyed this meta-theatrical device.This edition includes an essay on the performance history of the piece, and interviews with four prominent directors (Kenneth Branagh, Edward Hall, Nicholas Hytner & Michael Boyd). It will be of special interest to those who enjoy exploring the multitude of interpretations “Henry V” lends itself to. The Modern Library edition also includes a scene by scene analysis, which can help point out an image or symbol you might have missed. The edition also includes a nice “Further Readings” list specifically for “Henry V”Frankly, all of the extra essays allow you to dive into the world of the play, and it is all included in one text.The RSC Modern Library editions are a nice new trade paperback with worthwhile extras. They are a good addition to the editions of Shakespeare out there.

If you love Kurt Vonnegut, you should read this collection.The book is divided up by decade, starting in the 1950s and concluding in 2007 (when Vonnegut died). The letters appear chronologically and are preceded by a brief italicized intro that explains who the letter is to, and any dated references the reader may not know. The collection’s editor, Dan Wakefield, writes a simple yet enlightening introduction to the text, and also a brief preface before each chapter (again divided up by decade) giving a brief biography of what was happening in Vonnegut’s life in that decade. This gives a nice context for the letters you are about to read.I enjoyed this collection very much, it is a kind of biography of Vonnegut’s life, and you can easily trace the evolution of his happiness, and final bitterness with life and writing as you read his words through the decades. It is astonishing how much our letters, when we write as ourselves, revel about us. For the sake of this  I will just share a few highlights.On pages 118-120 we get an assignment that Vonnegut gives to his students at the Iowa Writer’s Workshop. A surface reading of the assignment would come across as shallow, with no real depth. But it is lovely, and so typical of Vonnegut. Of course it is the farthest thing from shallow, and very thought provoking indeed.On page 140 Vonnegut writes a letter to the local draft board about his son Mark as a conscientious objector to the Vietnam War. All I can say about that is wow.Especially touching, and just very well written are letters that Vonnegut wrote to his daughter “Nanny” in the early 1970s as his marriage was ending. The honesty and love in them is quite something. In fact, Vonnegut’s letters to Nanny stand out in the collection as a whole as she was one of the regular recipients of his letters from that point in his life on.“Letters” is a valuable text for many reasons. The lost art of correspondence is clearly on display in these letters. But it is also a chronicle of life, not just Vonnegut’s but our own as well. As you read you will see triumph and disappointment, love come and go, anger and bitterness, and sometimes a glimmer of hope. It is a chronicle of this journey we take around the sun for a little while before we move on.

They flow together seamlessly. This play continues the journey of Prince Hal as he becomes Henry V, and I think is a more satisfying play than its predecessor. The giant figure in these two plays, Sir John Falstaff, was much more pleasing and intriguing to me here then he was in “Henry IV Part I”. His humanity was all encompassing and richer, a much more interesting character arc in “Henry IV Part II”.Act 2:4 gives us a good time in the Eastcheap tavern, and I found it especially enjoyable as Shakespeare gives many characters some nice moments in this scene. Another highlight is Act 3:1 where Henry IV has a soliloquy about his longing for sleep and peace. It is a beautiful moment that anyone who has had a troubled mind (everyone) can find truth in. Another joy to be had in Act 3 is the introduction of one of my favorite characters, the wonderful Justice Shallow. He is a great cameo role, where Shakespeare’s genius for creating very real people with little stage time is on full display. He would be a treat for any actor to play. The final act of this play is one of many conflicting emotions, and the dramatic irony of Act 5:3 is discomforting for the reader as you watch Falstaff (who I came to love through this piece) celebrate a joy that you know is already dashed. In Act 5:5 we get one of the saddest scenes in all of Shakespeare. Falstaff is cruelly rejected by the newly crowned Henry V in a scene that is terrifying to read. Terrifying because Henry seems to (internally) want to reconcile his relationship with his old friend, but also knows his duties to the crown. It really is a scene about the end of a relationship with all the hurt, heartbreak, etc. those entail. When a great love (platonic, romantic, or otherwise) comes to an end it is a sobering sight.As for the Pelican Shakespeare series, they are my favorite editions since the scholarly research is usually top notch and the editions themselves look good as an aesthetic unit. It looks and feels like a play and this compliments the text's contents admirably. The Pelican series was recently reedited and has the latest scholarship on Shakespeare and his time period.

I think some references will fall on deaf ears, especially ones about the OJ Simpson trial, the Clinton & (first) Bush years, etc. Most of the items in this text were previously published, and I think the stronger pieces are the ones where Buckley is not writing a satire or humor piece, but rather just an observational essay on some subject (usually himself). Those pieces are much funnier than the ones where it is obvious he was hired to write “something funny”.The section of the book titled “Guy Stuff” is entertaining and one of the text’s strongest. Essays that appear later in the book like “Hot Hot Hot” (about femininity and ladies fashion) and “The Passion of St. Matt” (a rant against modern vernacular translations of the Bible) are very very good.One of the things I hugely appreciated about Buckley in “Wry Martinis” are the immense number of allusions and classical references he makes (unobtrusively) in much of his writing.

McCullough, par for the course, displays in this book his admiration and awe at the text’s subjects, and there is much to be in awe of in the lives of Wilbur and Orville Wright.The text is nicely paced and we get a quick  of the Wright’s lives and family history up to the late 1800s and then the book focuses heavily on their lives between 1898 and 1910, the period of their invention and work on various aspects of the airplane and flying. The subject matter is endlessly fascinating, and Mr. McCullough never lets you lose sight of the significance and brilliance of the achievements of the Wright brothers. These two were American in the best sense, two completely self-funded, self-educated, hardworking geniuses, who were tireless to educate themselves and learn more and more and work harder and harder to meet their goals. That is a good story no matter how you swing it. I had to chuckle when the aviation experiments funded by the government flopped while the Wright’s continued their dogged pursuit of manned flight.Much has been made by some that this book does not focus on the myriad patent lawsuits the Wright brothers were involved in. They’re not ignored, they are given attention, but not an undue amount since the Wright’s won all 9 lawsuits they were involved in. McCullough will not let this story get bogged down in ugliness. There are enough discouraging things out there to read. This text is not one of them.I greatly enjoyed “The Wright Brothers”, and I think you will too. The text is complemented by some excellent photos (3 sections throughout) and an Epilogue that is succinct and ends the book nicely....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Mar 19, 2016","Mar 27, 2016","Mar 19, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22609391-the-wright-brothers

From its mouthful of a title to the rather bland and quiet few opening pages the reader is“The Marrowbone Marble Company” is a very unexpected novel. From its mouthful of a title to the rather bland and quiet few opening pages the reader is not given a hint at the ride they are in for. The novel starts off slowly, and then unexpectedly and out of nowhere you have fallen under its spell.The text is written in the third person with the author letting us in and out of a multitude of characters’ heads, often times from sentence to sentence. We even get into the heads of minor characters, and as a result the novel and the world created has a very well rounded feeling. It is real. I really don’t want to get into plot devices in this . One of the joys for me while reading it was that I had no idea what was coming next. The text is episodic and takes place mainly in West Virginia between 1941 and 1969. The civil rights struggle is a key element in the story.A delightful moment in the novel is the chapter that deals with the first service of the “Land of Canaan Congregational Church”. It ends up being a key scene in the novel though you would never think that while reading it. The manner in which it is written is an excellent example of the strengths of the style in which the author, Glenn Taylor, alternated point of view to great effect.Every time I picked up the novel I was absorbed and it reads astonishing quickly. For the last 60 or so pages you will be loath to set the text down.A criticism that some have leveled at “The Marrowbone Marble Company” is that it was preachy and too political. I’m not sure that it gets political in the sense of pitting republicans against democrats. It is West Virginia in the mid twentieth century, everyone is a democrat. Rather it is about good and bad people, and they fill every spectrum of humanity. The text can get preachy, but I really did not mind. In fact, I was emotional a few times while reading, and I was not prepared to be. Yes, lines like “I think God made all people good and then some of em get taught bad.” is sentimental, but so what! It’s also true!Throughout the novel Mr. Taylor reveals information in a manner that gives you more details about a person or situation at a time that you are not anticipating it. He does this seamlessly. It is a mark of a very good writer. After you have finished the book, go back and reread the Prologue. You will appreciate it on a whole other level. I love books that do that. This text was an unexpected find and a great pleasure to read. Can’t say anything better about a book than that!...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Mar 06, 2016","Mar 19, 2016","Mar 06, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10788304-the-marrowbone-marble-company

Let’s not get carried away here.I am a huge Tom Robbins fan, despite the fact that when first introduced to him years ago I just was not all that enthralled. I changed somewhere along the line, and now I devour his works. I am continually amazed by his skills as a figurative writer, and the miasma of his mind. Robbins can write a paragraph (as he does in “Woodpecker”) describing tequila or the rain and it is absorbing, beautifully written, and catches the essence of what it is he is describing. I have not come across many writers in my reading life capable of that feat. But as he writes in this book “Outlaws, like poets, rearrange the nightmare.” Mr. Robbins probably qualifies as both. Another example of the excellence of this text is in chapter 38 where Robbins has insightful things to say about the true nature of socialism, capitalism, equality, good & evil, and red hair!The weakness of this novel is the part called “Phase III”. It gets a little dull (compared to the parts that preceded it) and a little too out there for my tastes. It is philosophical a bit too much for its own sake and not in service to the story. It is a little “precious” and detracts from the text.“Still Life with Woodpecker” is a unique read. You will not come across many novels like it. Like most Robbins it is incredibly inventive and creative, and Robbins inserts himself as the “author” in a persona throughout the text in a device that works well.If you have never read Tom Robbins before I would not start with “Still Life with Woodpecker”, but if you have read and appreciated Robbins before you must continue the journey with this book....more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,"Feb 28, 2016","Mar 05, 2016","Feb 28, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/294190.Still_Life_with_Woodpecker

It did not detract from the text, but I did not care for it. In small doses I am okay with this device in biography. A little too much here.As for the good in the text, Mr. Johnson clearly has an appreciation and knowledge of the works of Mozart and it is infectious to the reader. With such a strong focus on the music more than the life of Mozart it could have been a dull read, but I did not find it so. The Epilogue of the text is simply wonderful. A great ending to the read, it serves as the author’s final appreciation for Mozart and it is one of the strongest sections of the book.Paul Johnson gives a vociferous defense of Mozart’s wife Constanze and his marriage in the book, arguing quite persuasively that Mozart did not live and die in poverty, and that his marriage to Constanze seems to have been a happy one. Rehabilitating her image clearly is a big deal to Mr. Johnson. Proving these points comes up a bit in the text and I feel he makes his argument nicely, referencing quite a few sources hard to quibble with.The book also includes an article called “Mozart in London” by Daniel Johnson (from 2006) which is an unnecessary but fine coda to the text.Read “Mozart A Life” with Mozart’s music playing in the background and you will have yourself a fine afternoon....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Feb 27, 2016","Feb 28, 2016","Feb 27, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17675009-mozart

I never knew what was coming next. A novelist could not make some of this stuff up. Tudor England really was one continual soap opera.Although the focus of “Elizabeth the Struggle for the Throne” is how Elizabeth Tudor gained the crown of England, it is not about her per se, as much as it is about the politics of the age, and how she maneuvered around and through it. And nothing of great consequence was happening in England during this period that did not in some way involve Elizabeth.The text reads rather quickly, especially the first 200 or so pages. David Starkey does have a tendency to get bogged down in describing possessions (homes, tapestries, gold plate, etc.) in a lot of detail. It is an admitted passion of his, and he contends a key component of understanding people. And that is possibly true, but after a while it gets a little dull for a reader of popular history.“Elizabeth the struggle for the Throne” moves at a brisk pace keeping the reader engaged and the facts flowing effortlessly (more or less) until Queen Mary I (Elizabeth’s half sister) begins to die and Elizabeth moves closer to ascending the throne of England. At that moment the book inexplicably slows down, and from that point on it never really recovers its former pacing and it ends with a kind of whimper.It you love History, and English Tudor history especially; this will be a welcome addition to your bookshelf.

Mr. David even goes so far (or low?) to include his catch phrase “pretty pretty pretty pretty good” in the text.

There are lots of subplots that get too quickly resolved or ignored altogether.

His thoughts on the “weyard sisters” are ideas I had not come across before when reading about this play.“Macbeth"" boasts Shakespeare's most terrifying villain in that Macbeth is the Shakespearean villain that most reminds us of ourselves! Macbeth makes that first mistake, the murder of his king, and then he slides down the slippery slope killing more and more in order to cover up his original deed. What makes Macbeth so horrible is that he has guilt about his actions, unlike Shakespeare's other villains. However, he finds himself so ensnared in the web of murder and deceit that he can't ever get out. His murderous tentacles stretch out to engulf his best friend, an innocent woman and her children, and others. It is in that terrifying feeling of a guilty conscience and no escape that we all can share, and thus Macbeth is truly frightening! We recognize him!This play, while one of Shakespeare's shortest, boast two of his finest creations in Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. The couple sizzles with sexuality, unlike most Shakespearean marriages, and the scenes where Lady Macbeth drives along her husband's weakening ambitions are as exciting as they come.The supporting cast in this play is rather one note (with a few exceptions, the Porter chief among them) and I think Shakespeare intended it that way. This is an intimate study in evil, and its power over decent individuals, and the supporting cast is meant to merely back up these assertions about the leading couple, not distract from them.Lady Macbeth tells her husband that if he ""screws his courage to the sticking place, we will not fail."" Bad advice, but we the reader get to go along for the nihilistic ride that follows.This edition includes an essay on the performance history of the piece, and interviews with three prominent directors (Trevor Nunn, Gregory Doran, & Rupert Goold) will be of special interest to those who enjoy exploring the multitude of interpretations “Macbeth” lends itself to. The Modern Library edition also includes a scene by scene analysis, which can help point out an image or symbol you might have missed.

I“Island of the Sequined Love Nun” is great for reading with your toes in the sand, the ocean pounding on the shore, and the sun beating down on you. It will add to the atmosphere. It is an earlier work of Christopher Moore and is humorous, but not laugh out loud vulgar like some of his more recent books. I prefer this. The text is also very fast paced. In fact it reads like an action adventure novel at times.The protagonist of “Island of the Sequined Love Nun” is a colossal screw-up pilot, Tucker Case. Tucker is a well-developed character and his moments of self-reflection have some real depth to them. Tucker is a screw-up with a moral sense. There is right and wrong in his life, even if he does not always live up to its standards. There are some caricatures in the text also, but it creates a nice working mix to the cast of characters. One of my personal favorites is the old cannibal Sarapul. This character demonstrates how good Moore is at slipping slang into a character’s speech that is not at all realistic, but boy is it funny.Religion and what constitutes faith is a key component in the book, and Moore seems to be mocking both (a little) and celebrating them (a lot). Pulling off that hat trick makes for great satire. And it gives this work some of its better moments.I believe this is one of Moore’s stronger efforts. There are few to no slow moments. The ending is not great, but it works. “Island of the Sequined Love Nun” is clever, and there are not many books out there that examine cargo cults, faith, and sex in quite the manner this text does.

I have no reason why I thought it would disappoint, but I did. And I was wrong.First off, if you are not familiar with Shakespeare’s “Twelfth Night” I think parts of this novel will fall flat for you. The author, Alan Gordon, assumes a lot of familiarity with Shakespeare’s play on the reader’s part. The protagonist is a member of the Fool’s Guild named Theophilos, better known as the fool Feste from “Twelfth Night.” This story takes place fifteen years after the events of that play. Most of the cast of characters are lifted from that work.I really loved the premise that Mr. Gordon uses in this text of the idea of a medieval “Fool’s Guild” that is actually a secret religious organization righting the wrongs of society. The text also contains enough historical references to please the medievalist in all of us.One quibble I have is that the denouement is disjointed and felt a little rushed to me, like the author was trying to get to the final action. I thought it would have aided the book for that section to have been a little more developed.The ending is fast paced and abrupt, and it actually works for the text. When you finish reading don’t think about it. Just close the book with a smile and move on with your day. “Thirteenth Night” is a mystery novel, and it is a good one.

That astronaut is named Mark Watney and his first person log entries on Mars are the highlight of the novel. His sarcastic and macabre sense of humor is a joy to read and deepens our understanding of his character in all the ways that the best characterization is supposed to.This book contains a lot of science, and I did not understand much of it. However, the author (Andy Weir) uses it in such a way that it helps create the world of the novel and it does not in any manner detract or confuse the reader. Even when you don’t understand some of the nitty gritty he describes, it helps to pull the reader into the story as it makes what is currently impossible (Mars exploration) seem very possible.“The Martian” is Mr. Weir’s first novel and there are moments you can tell. The sections of the text that take place back on Earth are not nearly as strong as the sections that come from the protagonists’ first person point of view.The text is very well plotted, and like the best of science fiction it seems entirely plausible. Mr. Weir has created such a realistic story that every new twist in the book seems like the logical next event. Also very good was the author’s decision to tell us next to nothing about his hero other than his education and the fact that he has parents alive on Earth. Keeping the book focused on the survival story and forgoing all of the sentimental extras kept the novel from getting bogged down.The last 20 pages of the book will not let you get up.

I recently purchased the first two books, and have just finished the first, “A Blaze of Glory”.

He also writes battle scenes very well. Especially notable in this text is chapter 16 where we witness the early morning start to the Battle of Shiloh through the eyes of a Union private from Wisconsin. It is very well done. The novel’s writing is stronger in the sections that are written in first person. The author’s third person narration tends to get bogged down in minutia and reads slowly compared to the other sections.As anyone who has read much of Shaara knows he has a wooden ear for dialogue and there are times his characters speak in such stilted language that it gets annoyingly distracting. But I expected that to happen having read a few of his novels.“A Blaze of Glory” is a book that has moments of excellent prose, and on the next page you read a section of grimace inducing dialogue. The inconsistency in the writing’s quality is a flaw, but not a terribly distracting one.

Marie does nothing serious to make her life or the life of her child better, but she has moments where she really wants to change/ progress.

Kudos also goes to Mr. Wells for constantly reminding the reader that his interpretations are at best conjecture. We can never know for sure what Shakespeare was thinking or intending.

His explanations are intriguing and thought provoking. He is also very zealous about pointing out that much of what people put on/into Shakespeare is from their perspective.

The dry humor comes out quite a bit in the process of dying.Hitchens salient effort to be pragmatic and brave in the force of his mortality gives the book the push that propels the reader to the end.

The first two acts of t“Pericles” is an episodic play, very Dickens like in its large cast of characters, sprawling locales, and spanning many years. The first two acts of the play are generally considered to have been written by George Wilkins, and one can clearly see Shakespeare’s pen at work in the last three acts. And the play works. It is enjoyable to read (again, especially the last 3 acts) and fun to watch performed.I gave ""Pericles"" a 3.5 star rating compared to other Shakespeare, not to literature as a whole. The Bard is in a class of his own.The text boasts many interesting supporting characters, but one of my favorites is Dionyza, the prototypical jealous evil queen/stepmother out of fairytales. Her silky fake sweetness is a delight to read. In a play full of intriguing supporting players, she stands out.Like most of Shakespeare, “Pericles” has some moments that seem especially relevant to our times. In Act 4:2 pimps in a brothel discuss their female acquisitions and the scene is one of the most disturbing in Shakespeare. Considering the modern sex trade it is eerily present day. It is skin crawling, and Shakespeare spares no subtly while having them detail their view of females and the commodity of sex. His making one of the pimps a female ups the queasiness in the scene even more.Contrasting this is Act 5, which is one of the most tender in all of the Bard’s output. His last plays had a resounding sentimentality much greater than his earlier work. Personally, I like those moments very much.“Pericles” is an epic adventure, spread out over 14 years with grace, reunification and redemption to end it all in a satisfying manner. It is a very pleasing read.As for the Pelican Shakespeare series, they are my favorite editions since the scholarly research is usually top notch and the editions themselves look good as an aesthetic unit.

If you are not intimately familiar with the play it will in no manner enhance your reading of it.For the sake of this  I will focus on some of the more pleasing aspects of the play. From his first entrance the character of Costard is a delight. Like most Shakespearean clowns he is the most honest person on the stage, and his bafflement at the antics of some of the nobler characters is easily shared by the reader. The play boasts another wonderful creation in the character of Don Adriano De Armado, a Spaniard who uses a ridiculous profusion of words to high comic effect. His speech at the end of Act 1:2 is a fun moment in the play.Act 5 (one of the longest in Shakespeare) travels from riotous comedy to the pain of sudden death, as can life, and I guess that is the point. The text ends beautifully with two of the most evocative poems written by Shakespeare, the often anthologized “Spring” & “Winter”. As one critic has written of those two pieces, they are “an expression of the going-on power of life” and they end the play admirably.There is nothing wrong with “Love’s Labor’s Lost”; it just does not get to me as much as other Shakespeare. The constant wordplay and confusion with some of the archaic language used in many of the jokes just keep me from fully getting pulled into the story of the play.As for the Pelican Shakespeare series, they are my favorite editions since the scholarly research is usually top notch and the editions themselves look good as an aesthetic unit.

Also present are many of the characters we love and remember, the only new character of any special prominence is Henry Clinton, a man the adult Scout is kind of dating, and who was a childhood friend who entered their lives in the period after “Mockingbird” took place. Occasionally in the early chapters Ms. Lee puts us in his head for brief periods. Promoted to more relevance in this text is the character of Uncle Jack, who has moved back to Maycomb from Nashville (where he lived in “Mockingbird”). He is central to this story, and the book’s most profound moments (surprisingly & appropriately) belong to him, not Atticus.In chapter five we get the first flashback to Scout’s childhood, and I relished the chance to see Jem, Dill, and Scout at their imaginary games once again. It was simply a joy to read in those moments. When the 26 year old Scout has memory flashbacks (there are a few, but not too many) the book is firing on all cylinders.Chapter 17 deals with constitutional & judicial conservatism. Scout (and perhaps Ms. Lee?) clearly have those beliefs and I fear it will go over the heads of modern readers who have a limited understanding of these issues and how they played out in the racial politics of the 1950s. It is important to remember that at the time this book was written this chapter and its contents would have spoken directly to the audience. It actually still does considering the far reaching Supreme Court rulings of this past year, and Lee handles these issues with dignity and intelligence and it makes me sigh when I realize that this kind of intelligent discourse has probably left the American political stage for good.Now, to those who have this image of a sacred and infallible Atticus, chapter 18 takes them down and makes it unflinchingly important why this is a bad way to view this character. In “Watchman” Atticus is old and tired and that makes him wonderfully human and in no way diminishes him. All I can say about this chapter (which is the thematic centerpiece of the novel) is wow. It is so wise, so profound, so simple, reminding the reader of everyone’s humanity. I have always loved Attics Finch. He is the father everyone wants for themselves, and what they hope to provide to their children. And he is not possible. “Watchman” brings Atticus into the human realm, and it is important that this happens. I adore him even more now than I did and it is because now that I see he is flawed (not terribly, just realistically) I see how in some manner I could actually be a little like him. And that realization makes me hopeful, and happy.“Go Set A Watchman” is a wonderful text, full of the vibrant locales and local color that made “Mockingbird” such a delight. You can see how “Mockingbird” was influenced tremendously from this earlier text, and it serves as a great compliment to “Mockingbird” as it rounds out that tale even more completely....more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,not set,not set,"Feb 20, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/24817626-go-set-a-watchman

I can easily say that it was an excellent read and well worth the time.The author, James L. Swanson, writes in a very easy going colloquial style. In fact, there are times in the text where the writing seems a little too simplistic, but those are just fleeting moments. Mr. Swanson is very good at creating moments of tension and high drama. This is all the more remarkable because the story he is telling is so well known. The moment of Lincoln’s assassination and Booth’s death in the Garrett barn are two of the best examples of these kinds of moments in a text filled with such scenes.This text is well researched and documented (extensive bibliography and Notes sections). I read a lot on the Civil War and have for years and there were many many things about the assassination and its aftermath that I had never come across before. I love when that happens!“Manhunt” is as accessible and thorough an account of Abraham Lincoln’s assassination as is currently available and I highly recommend it.

I don’t say that as a negative, just a factual account of how long it took me to get into the text.There are moments in this novel, especially in Part Two, that anyone who has been in a close friendship that drifted apart will recognize. Kazuo Ishiguro does a nice job of showing, not telling, his readers the emotional life of his characters, and I appreciated his restraint in not telegraphing every emotion his character’s felt. On the opposite end, one of the most annoying aspects of the text was the constant obvious transitions between each section/chapter. Was there no other way to link chapters without using closing lines that directly state the link to the next section?

I was pleasantly surprised and will check out more of his work soon. It is an interesting and quick read. It held my attention throughout and I found myself sitting at a stretch reading it.The book is in first person told from the perspective of our narrator Judd Foxman as he sits seven days of Shiva for his recently deceased (atheist) father. With that delicious irony of a set-up we are introduced to Judd’s family which is chock full of fascinating individuals. Mr. Tropper manages to make all of them quirky enough to be compelling “characters” while also coming across as real people. That is no small feat, and the novel wonderfully captures the mesh of emotions that one experiences losing an emotionally distant parent with an innate accuracy that will force most readers into recognizing many aspects of the various familial relationships depicted in the text.A major theme in the novel is the idea that “the only thing you can ever really know about anyone is that you don’t know anything about them at all.” As much as we can love someone we usually keep a part of ourselves back, and in this novel so much of what the characters perceive about each other is only a part of the whole. Mr. Tropper does not seem to be lamenting this facet of human nature, just being honest that it exists. As Judd says later in the novel, “Under attack, we retreat into stoic fortresses built for one.” This idea plagues most of the characters in the book, and many of the plot points revolve around the idea of letting someone into that fortress at the times when we feel most vulnerable.There are moments in this book that are so well written that you wish you had written them yourself because you instantly understand them. There are quite a few examples strewn throughout the text, but one is on page 221 when Judd says, “Even under the best of circumstances, there’s just something so damn tragic about growing up.” That one made me put the book down and think for a while.I actually saw the film version of this novel and only picked up the book while browsing a bookstore. I could not remember much about that film other than that I thought it was mediocre. If you felt the same as I did about the movie don’t let that dissuade you.

Isaacson writes in a fluid and easy style that engages the reader and makes this larger than life founding father accessible and important to the modern reader.As you read this biography you are overwhelmed by how practical, smart, and just darn wise Ben Franklin was! Isaacson uses Franklin’s own words often (Franklin was a prolific writer) and you will find yourself underlining and annotating quite a bit. The word “practical” pops up a lot in the text as Isaacson stresses over and over how this was a very salient attribute of Franklin’s and a pervasive philosophy he championed. Everything from his scientific endeavors to his religious and philosophical musings was based on the idea of practicality in everyday life.The texts abound with little nuggets of information that make the reader shake their head in wonder. Little things, like the fact that Franklin originated the use of the pro/con list. It also includes an outstanding section titled “Defining his God” which is massively interesting. Benjamin Franklin had some intriguing insights on religion. The book also skillfully and forcefully demonstrates Franklin’s creation and championing of the idea of an American middle class. An ideal that he was a proponent of his entire life.A small quibble with the book is a section in the Conclusion called “History’s Reflections”. I could have done without it. It traces Franklin’s reputation from his death to the present. I am not sure why, but I felt it detracted from the text.“Benjamin Franklin: An American Life” is an interesting chronological narrative that one cannot read without appreciating what an enormous impact Franklin made on the American character up to this very day.

He is so good at using a pivotal event/moment in history as a point to begin examining the age in which it occurred. His books are always about the era through the lens of one event. “Dead Wake” proves to be no exception.Some strengths of the book include Part II of the text when Larson writes short quick chapters, jumping from four main locales (U-20, the Lusitania, England, and Washington DC). The quick pacing makes the reader barrel toward a climax that they know is inevitable. It is a nice device. Actually the entire book moves along at a quick pace, but once the torpedo hits the Lusitania Larson kicks the book into high gear and the reader feels like they are being propelled full bore down the halls of history. You will find yourself holding your breath as Larson depicts the 18 minutes it took the mighty ocean liner to sink.Like all Larson, a single event is used to illuminate an age.

We never really know the whole story. In chapter forty seven Lucy says “This is what happens in life. People mess up.” And I think that is a key theme of the novel. This is wisdom of years and experience speaking, and in ""The Husband’s Secret” (as in life) everyone has messed up. It is the moving past it, and the manners in which we do so, that causes problems.A quibble with the text is that there are a couple of plot points that are contrived and too cliché.

The two pie“We Are What We Pretend To Be” is really two novellas, supposedly Vonnegut’s first unpublished short story, and his last unfinished novel. The two pieces could not be more different.The first novella is called “Basic Training”, and according to Vonnegut’s daughter has hints of autobiography. It is an interesting read because as you read it you see elements that would in later works become vintage Vonnegut themes. In the story an orphaned city boy named Haley is displaced to a farm and a life managed by a strict former general for whom discipline is the only game in town. “Basic Training” seems to be about the ways we can love someone. The “General” comes across as a harsh unfeeling man, but Vonnegut undeniably endows him with a sense of pride, practicality, and love. This is a character who Vonnegut clearly likes and for the modern reader I think it is good to see a character with the General’s traits depicted in a positive light. The story is weak, but considering it was Vonnegut’s “first” piece, it is an intriguing read.The second piece, “If God Were Alive Today”, contains elements that if you are familiar with some of Vonnegut’s speeches and writings in his last years you will have seen before. Its protagonist, Gil Berman, is a thinly disguised persona for Vonnegut and the misery that Berman describes in his life comes from direct quotes Vonnegut wrote in letters and gave in speeches, referring to himself. The piece has laugh out loud moments, and more of the Vonnegut black humor than “Basic Training”, but it is not funny. Gil Berman is a tragic figure really. A lonely man who it seems can’t recover from a mistake he made 20 years ago. The ending of “If God Were Alive Today” is abrupt and painful. It is an “unfinished” piece but the ending works. I was very quiet for a while after finishing it. The story seems to be commenting on how much pain and/or joy in life can result from long ago decisions. And that is a very sobering thought! This piece is much darker than most Vonnegut I have read. As it was composed as his life was ending, and by all accounts unhappy, it makes macabre sense.“We Are What We Pretend To Be” does not rank with the best Vonnegut certainly, but if you are a fan and have read most of his other output you should read this.

Glen Berger is unabashed in giving the reader the truth behind the creative process that is always very carefully hidden from public view. The angles, backhandedness, and just general childishness that many of the text's key players display are mind boggling to read.

Mythological allusions abound in this book, and sometimes they work, and sometimes they don'tAs already mentioned, ""Song of Spiderman"" is filled with many moments of real depth and insight. There was numerous times where I was struck by a sentiment or phrase. Just a sampling, ""The deepest yearning of an artist is to communicate. And revenge is communication."" When you read a line like that, you either completely understand it, or you don't. The text is (as the writer asserts over and over) merely a story, which is how we humans craft our lives, and I would also contend that like the best stories at its center are relationships. At one point Berger writes, ""As soon as a relationship is built, we carry around the codes to atomize it."" A sobering truth that, and the universality of human interactions are what make this text so enjoyable for most readers.As a fun exercise I would encourage the reader to YouTube some videos of media interviews and behind the scenes footage of the musical while reading the book. It creates an interesting contrast between early interviews and those that happen after Julie Taymor left the production. It adds to the experience of reading this memoir.Glen Berger is either a self deprecating truth teller, so honest that he is not afraid to make himself look bad or a devious sneak who knows how to manipulate his readers.

This play, one of Shakespeare’s earliest, shows an understanding of human nature and relationships as good as any in his more mature works, and it is very funny to boot!I gave ""The Taming of the Shrew"" a 5 star rating compared to other Shakespeare, not to literature as a whole. The Bard is in a class of his own.The Pelican series edition of this play has a very nice introduction by Stephen Orgel who writes a short, but informative, essay that gives good historical references and accepts the play on its own terms. Something many modern critics refuse to do.The “Induction” scene that sets up the play within a play device is clever and cruel at the same time. Though very rarely performed (I have seen “Shrew” 3 times and it has always been cut) it is an interesting read.When Petruchio and Kate first meet we are treated to one of the most enjoyable, and sexy, scenes in all of Shakespeare. There is clearly mutual loathing and lust in their verbal fireworks and the reader knows right away that these two were made for each other.There really is not a downbeat in the entire play, and as you read through the text you will find yourself continually pleased. Act 5 is one of the best final acts in the entire canon, and one would be hard put to find a more pleasing scene in any of the comedies than Act 5:1 which is funny, quick paced and happily resolved. I have never seen the play performed where it was not a crowd favorite.I also think a close read of Kate’s final speech (the play’s longest and most misunderstood) shows she is not defeated by her (now) husband Petruchio, but rather that she is smarter in her interaction with people. It reminds me of that adage, “You win more flies with honey then with vinegar”.“The Taming of the Shrew” has withstood the test of time for many reasons, not least of which is because it is one of the most enjoyable of Shakespeare’s plays in performance, and on the page.As for the Pelican Shakespeare series, they are my favorite editions since the scholarly research is usually top notch and the editions themselves look good as an aesthetic unit.

If you have ever seen him on television you know this. But he is also a funny and engaging writer, and “The Joy of Hate” is proof of that! In this book Gutfeld takes on the fake idea of tolerance that seems to permeate our society. The structure of the text is simple; each chapter is a stand-alone essay on a topic. However, all of the chapters are linked by the idea of the phoniness of “tolerance” as it is practiced by some folks today. Gutfeld rightly takes to task those who scream tolerance at everyone, but don’t extend it to people who don’t think like them.I actually laughed out loud at times while reading this text, and that does not happen often when reading a book of this nature. Gutfeld is really in his element here and his self-deprecating humor is used throughout the text. Here are just some of the notable highlights for me…first the chapter called “The Vagina Demagogues” is brilliant! Gutfeld takes the hypocrisies of people and unashamedly (and gleefully) puts them through the ringer. The chapter called “The Pirates of Penance” is a must read for every citizen. Although it is humorously presented, its point that we are a nation of wimps (on many levels) is a very important one. Also very enjoyable is Gutfeld’s defense of our military and his takedown of the hypocrisy of the academics who attack it is succinct and funny. Two things that most academics are not!The conclusion to “The Joy of Hate” is spot on. I can’t say it better than the author, stop with the “fleeting emotional orgasm that is outrage” and just live you darn life. Pretty good medicine really, and I enjoyed taking it.

By the way, I give ""King John"" a 3.5 star rating compared to other Shakespeare, not to literature as a whole. The Bard is in a class of his own.The Pelican series edition of this play has a very nice introduction by Claire McEachern in which she gives an informative discourse on the character of Philip the Bastard. Although Philip usually gets all the critical attention in this piece my favorite character is Constance, sister in law to King John and the mother of John’s rival for the English throne. Act III:1 give Constance a chance to really show her stuff. She has some blistering moments, and Act III as a whole is by far the most engaging and strongest in the play. Constance’s exit from the piece is her best scene and Shakespeare writes a grieving mother’s storm of emotions as strongly as in any of his other works.At its core “King John” is really a play about the medieval issues brought about by “Pope v. Prince” and how secular and religious power used each other for gain. You can almost feel Shakespeare’s Protestant Elizabethan audience hissing at the machinations of the Catholic villain Cardinal Pandulph as he manipulates the French and English royal powers in some of the plays most intriguing scenes. Another fine moment is Act III:3 when King John and Hubert share a conversation that is delicious in its duplicity, and all of it achieved with minimal words.Despite a weak Act V (the only reason I feel this is not a 4 star effort by Shakespeare) the play ends on a patriotic note, sounding a clarion call for Englishmen to always unite in common cause. One can see how “King John” was an early indication of Shakespeare’s skill and why it still endures.As for the Pelican Shakespeare series, they are my favorite editions as the scholarly research is usually top notch and the editions themselves look good as an aesthetic unit.

Now in my mid-thirties it says something very different to me now then it did back then.I have been on a bit of a Nick Hornby kick lately, and I am continually impressed by his technical skills as a writer. The chapters in this text alternate point of view between Marcus (a 12 year old boy) and Will (a 36 year old cad bachelor). The change in voice and tone every several pages sets up a nice contrast in the style of the novel, and it works well. Hornby also does an excellent job with the character of Marcus. Marcus thinks and sounds like a plausible bright 12 year old boy. Often in novels when authors write young kids the kids have skills and thoughts well beyond their years. Not so in this case.In the novel one of the characters realizes that the things that makes life relatively “safe” and enjoyable are the people you love. As he realizes that this circle can and should expand beyond blood family he remarks “You can find people” and goes on to reflect how those people form part of the security net that we all need to feel to be self-actualized beings. It is a subtle and powerful element of the book.One of my favorite things about Nick Hornby is his uncanny ability to write characters who although their situations are nothing in my realm of experience I find I know them very well. Thus his novels have more impact on me because I see myself and those I love in his books. “About a Boy” is no exception. The story kind of comes full circle as the two main characters develop into the next stage of their lives. There is no miraculous change of heart or movie moment of recognition, just a gradual development into the next phase of living.

Reading it one instantly gets the same feeling you get from the best O’Neil and Williams dramas. And like those plays, it is saturated with anger and bitterness and love, and all those complex emotions that make us human.Tracy Letts has written the text in a very simple direct style that flows easily, and the structure of the piece fills out nicely. It opens with a prologue that is worth going back and rereading after getting about halfway through, just to see what new resonance it has now that the reader has more information.Written in three acts, the same structure that many great American plays seem to share, the first act pulls you in with an interesting ensemble and plotlines that hint at more under the surface. The second act features a family dinner for the ages and violently and relentlessly will propel the reader to its conclusion. The third act contains more scenes, seems to have a quicker pace, and really punches the reader in the gut with many moments that come up in quick succession. In the hands of a talented director and cast this play would be a gripping night in the theatre.A key moment that stood out to me was Act 3:2, when the character of Barbara realizes that she will never really know why her marriage ended. That moment of acknowledging that she will never get the answers she deserves is recognizable, and painful, to anyone who has suffered through a breakup where the communication was less than should be desired. And really, that lack of honest communication is what the play is about in general. Our inability to be honest with others, and ourselves, is a profound recognition that you see in yourself as you read this play. Which brings me to the ending of the piece, a dark warning that to live your life without honesty and kindness will catch up to you at some point.“August: Osage County” is a play that will be performed and read for generations, and it deserves to be because it is about important human truths, and if we don’t read and go to the theatre every once in a while to have those things pointed out to us…then why are we doing it?...more",Notes are private!,0,43,1,not set,not set,"Feb 18, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2437710.August

It is composed of short, poetical (at times) chapters that form a loose narrative that seems to begin in the narrator’s early childhood and ends in his early teenage years.The story, such as it is, is about three brothers growing up in a mixed heritage (white & Puerto Rican) home with parents who are sometimes physically and emotionally abusive, and often times neglectful. But there are no villains in this novel. The boys love their parents and vice versa. The parents in this story are not good parents, but usually they try and the narrator seems to give them some credit for that.The text is a very short and quick 125 pages, which is the right length for a book written in this style. Had it been longer it would have dragged on and been too much for most readers. There are many parts of the text that warrant rereading as they are dense with meaning and beauty. The chapter called “Trash Kites” is an example of stunning writing.The last 20 pages or so of the novel take a rather unexpected turn that you will not see coming. As a result I think the novel has some hints of autobiography in it, more than one would assume from a work of fiction. I am still thinking of the ending, especially the last page, and I still am not sure I get it.

What a great read it is! This is a cinematic novel true, but it is very well written and fluid and is a literary work.Don Winslow is excellent at characterization. You know these people, usually just because of one or two well-turned sentences that he writes to describe some aspect of them. It is not a skill that many writers have. “Savages” is also written in a unique style. I know that is an overused phrase but it is appropriate to describe this text. The stylistic choices work very well for this book and for the constantly shifting points of view and very short chapters that Winslow utilizes. It is unlike any other novel that I have read in that sense.There are a couple of weaknesses with the text, such as a political rant in chapter 40 that is the thinly disguised voice of the author through the mouthpiece of his characters. I don’t care about the political viewpoints, but they clearly don’t work in the context of the novel or the character, and so it detracts. The ending of the novel also feels rushed, but it works, so no major complaint there.There are numerous strongpoints to “Savages”, especially its themes which are broad and deep. At one point a character says “The only redeeming quality of the universe is its indifference” and that seems especially true in the world Winslow creates. It also works nicely with another theme of the text, the idea of savages and savagery being a state of mind and personal experience. Frankly, everyone in the book is a savage and that is the point. Also very enjoyable is the enigmatic chapter 271. The author’s persona in this chapter is conservative and liberal, spiritual and atheistic, etc. The contradiction comes together in this excellent short chapter, a quick discourse on the current American state.To find a novel that is enjoyable to read, well written and plotted, and also has something to say is a rare find. “Savages” is just such a book....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,not set,"Feb 18, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9378699-savages

This play exudes in the joys to be had in romping through the realms that we can never truly understand or explain. Realms like love, our dreams, fantasy, etc. It is a funny and clever play, and Shakespeare gives the reader a master class in interweaving three separate plotlines in a manner that is nicely and appropriately done.There are many joys to be had in reading (and seeing) “Midsummer”, but unique to reading the play here are just a few reasons why it is worth your attention. First, the introduction by Russ McDonald (Pelican Shakespeare edition) has some really good insights that I have not come across elsewhere. It is well done. As for the play itself, it yields countless joys, among them Act 2:1 where the leaders of the fairy fantastical world (Oberon and his queen Titania) have an epic quarrel. The scene boast some of the loveliest poetry in all of Shakespeare. The imagery is astoundingly fantastic. “Midsummer” actually contains some of the best poetry in the Shakespearean canon period, especially in the characters of Oberon- the King of the fairies, and Duke Theseus. In the hands of talented actors they have moments in the play that are mesmerizing. Act 5 of “Midsummer” is also one of the most pleasing and funny in all of Shakespeare. All of the loose plot lines are tied up; it has gut busting humor, and again that lovely poetry. As one of Shakespeare’s few original plotlines and a play where fantasy and harmony are emphasized, I imagine that the self-justification of art and artists was sometimes in his head as he wrote it.

However, the novel has a strength in being written by a songwriter as there are numerous times in the text when there are lines that are packed with layers of meaning, like the best poetry.The novel takes place in West Virginia immediately following WW I, and it is structured so that the chapters alternate between the present moment and two distinct past events. In this manner the gaps and unexplained elements of the “present tense” chapters are slowly explained and filled in. It is an effective device, complimented by the short chapters which keep the writing and pace of the novel fluid and quick.Without giving too much away I will say that as a writer Ritter is quite talented, as a person who develops plots that propel the reader along, not so much. What kept me the most engaged, besides the writing style, was the ambiguous nature of the text. It is hard to categorize and it can easily be placed in a few different genres, depending on your interpretation. That ambiguity is a joy of the book.“Bright’s Passage” is a text that holds up under scrutiny and I think it would be an excellent choice for book clubs as it touches upon a lot of good topics of discussion. All told I’m not dying for another novel by Mr. Ritter, but I would certainly not ignore it if he produced another....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Feb 18, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/12602061-bright-s-passage

Although th“Sellevision” is Augusten Burroughs’ only novel, to date, and having read all of his works it is safe to say that his forte is nonfiction. Although the plot is a good one, characterization is weak in this text and characterization is what makes for the best fiction. Still, it is an enjoyable read.The novel is a little dated, it was published in 2000, and I had to often chuckle at characters who express shock and amazement at email, and photos being sent as JPEG files, etc. It is not a weakness of the text certainly, just a reminder of how much the world has changed in the 14 years since this book was written.As already mentioned you can tell that fiction is not Burroughs strong suit. There are often instances of overwritten lines, and moments where there are insignificant details given that a good editor should have trimmed for him. The characters are also rather flat, but some of them are so enjoyable and funny that you can’t help but forgive this. The most delightful character in the text is Peggy Jean Smythe. She is very one note, but Burroughs play that note well and so you forgive the fact that she is one dimensional.The strongest aspect of this novel is its humor. There are many whip smart laugh out loud lines in the text. There are moments where the satire is so biting it stings, and it is lovely.The last chapter is the novel’s weakest, and the book ends on a bad note. It is not clever or fun and a letdown from some of the good moments that preceded it.

Nick Hornby really nails the emotions of a breakup, and the painful recognition of a stagnant life. So many folks are together because of the presence of a comfortable mundane routine. This novel deftly captures how that can trap you with the wrong person in a manner I have rarely seen so effectively used in modern literature.This book is about finding what really matters in life. As you get older the knowledge of what that is changes, and most of the novel’s characters get to that point in some form or another. There is remarkable characterization in this book. None of the characters are noble, all are a little odd, and they are so darn real. You recognize them, and yourself. Hornby has created people, just normal folks, with the good and bad mixed in together. For example, the character of Duncan, who is a douche, but is still a decent guy. Just really flawed…like most of us!The text is written in first person, from the alternating viewpoint (primarily) of three characters, with the occasional side trip into the mind of a secondary character thrown in. The device works as we get a well done, well rounded view of both sides of a breakup of a relationship, and also an inside view of a new relationship beginning.As I have stated, rarely has a book got into my head on such a level. “Juliet, Naked” is well written, nicely plotted, realistic enough to be satisfying, and honest and accurate enough about human nature to be a little unnerving, in a good way.

A relationship that suffered under the specter First off, I had just started this book before a 12 year relationship unexpectedly and suddenly ended. A relationship that suffered under the specter of evangelical Christianity the whole time, and so I am sure that it mirrored my reading of the text. Bear that in mind with this .Jeff Chu has written a book that celebrates God, and the structure of “Does Jesus Really Love Me?” follows his “pilgrimage” of sorts of visiting / investigating the myriad of ways in which American Christianity interacts with the issue of homosexuality. Chu is a good writer and the book flows with ease, and the setup of each chapter being a new experience with a new church or group works well. Chu also intersperses throughout the text little essays written by people that he met over the course of researching this book who he invited to put into their own words some thoughts they had. The mini-essay written by disgraced former mega-church pastor Ted Haggard is surprisingly thoughtful and profound. Mr. Chu also uses the life experience of an email correspondent named Gideon Eads as a thread throughout his own journey plopping in emails between the two of them throughout the text at appropriate points in the narrative. Eads’ final email to Chu, that ends the epilogue, is a devastating (in a good way) end to the text.Now to share some moments in the book that spoke to me. This is just a sampling, there are many others, and this text will resonate very differently with different readers based on life experience, etc. One moment that I found especially powerful was on page 190 when a young gay Christian shares with the author his poem “Ways I want to be Kissed”. This moment highlights a powerful message in the book, mainly that we need love and companionship in our lives. I also appreciated Chu’s willingness to say what he really felt at times. This became readily apparent to me when he talks about his feelings for the MCC (Metropolitan Community Church). He takes issue with the fact that the church is focused on the people in the church (mainly their sexuality) instead of Christ which is the antithesis of what religious worship is supposed to be. I appreciated his sensitivity to the church’s practice while still highlighting this huge (from his and my perspectives) flaw. He does not present all gay approving churches as dignified and right. Nor does he lump those who don’t approve of homosexuality into the (carelessly overused in today’s society) category of bigot. This evenhanded approach is one of the text’s biggest assets.“Does Jesus Really Love Me?” is an honest examination of two areas of American life that are often in contention, and I think it is worth reading for a variety of reasons by people on both sides of the debate. If for no other reason than to see portraits of the people on the other side that are not colored by an agenda.

They easily swing between deep profound love and then mere moments later believing the very worst about their lover. What makes the play so powerful is because of how recognizable the two are to us. We have all been with someone we knew we shouldn’t be with, but we could not stop ourselves. In Act 3:13 Shakespeare gives as good a rendering of that type of conflict as I have seen in literature.By the way, I give ""Antony & Cleopatra"" a 4.5 star rating compared to other Shakespeare, not to literature as a whole. The Bard is in a class of his own.In the character of Cleopatra Shakespeare is at the top of his game, as her character could easily have gotten away from him. Cleopatra could have been a caricature, but under Shakespeare’s firm hand she easily walks the line between a drama laden piece of work, and a woman of noble passion. Cleopatra comes into her own in the last act of the play (which is her solo moment) and Shakespeare’s skills as a dramatist practically slap the reader in the face.Some noteworthy mentions for this play include Act 4, especially in the last couple of scenes, where we get to enjoy some of Shakespeare’s greatest poetry. Beautiful, and pushing the plot along to its frantic conclusion. Also noteworthy is the wonderful character of Enobarbus, Antony’s lieutenant and longtime friend. Some of the greatest observations in the play are his, and his character has a complex and intriguing arc to play out.As for the Pelican Shakespeare series, they are my favorite editions as the scholarly research is usually top notch and the editions themselves look good as an aesthetic unit. It looks and feels like a play and this compliments the text's contents admirably. The Pelican series was recently reedited and has the latest scholarship on Shakespeare and his time period.

Although his most recent novels have disappointed me, this one (written in 2002) is one of my favorites. I have not read all of him yet, but so far “Basket Case” is up there.The novel is written in first person, in the voice of its protagonist Jack Tagger. Tagger is an obituary reporter, a former star of the journalistic scene who has fallen on hard times. His witty and dry sense of humor creates a nice voice for the novel.The setup for the mystery reeks of rumors about Courtney Love after the suicide of Kurt Cobain, and the crime is a little far-fetched for the results. However, it is a fun caper and a quick read. Music and writing are key components in the lives of the characters in the text and Hiaasen does an adroit job at creating that world. It adds a nice depth to the book.“Basket Case” is also less gory than other Hiaasen I have read, and the humor is more verbal and less slapstick. It is a nice change of pace, and I enjoyed that aspect of the book very much. Also worth mentioning is the protagonist’s fixation with death and the ages of characters when they kick it. It is a running gag throughout the text and it could get old, but it doesn’t and that is a testament to how judiciously and cleverly Hiaasen employs it.This text is a good example of how enjoyable Carl Hiaasen can be.

Boy what do you say about a novel of his? “Skinny Legs and All” is my third Robbins read, and there will be more. This novel contains the unique figurative language use that is a Robbins staple, no one else writes similes that are as out there (and as apt) as this guy! The book also boasts some main characters that are inanimate objects, the biblical characters of Jezebel and Salome play significant roles, and the whole thing starts out inside a truck that has been made to look like a giant turkey. And it works.Without getting into plot details, I will say that the fabled dance of the seven veils that Salome performed for her stepfather Herod serves as a major metaphor for the text. Robbins even goes so far as to divide the novel into seven parts, and ends each part with a minor discourse on some aspect of humanity that is “revealed” as a veil of Salome’s drops. It is a brilliant device, and really “Skinny Legs and All” is Robbins plea for humanity to embrace the beauty inherent in living and just leave it at that. All this other stuff we insist on just gets in the way.There are many great moments in the text; as Robbins has a sharp mind, as well as a felicity for writing. Some examples include page 118 where he sums up what politics is in one sentence that encapsulates the whole shebang, page 394 where his description of the Super Bowl is sadly accurate and astounding in its truth, and a description of rap music that might not please rap fans, but to which I was nodding my head vigorously in agreement.The last 20 pages or so are really the heart of the text, and they contain some heady philosophical thoughts. You will need to read this section a little slower and reread some parts to get the full impact, but it is worth it. The whole novel leads up to this point.“Skinny Legs and All” was written in 1990, and today it is sadly as relevant as ever.

Having them in one volume encourages you to read them soon after each other, and I think that enhances the experience.The collection also contains the horrid story “Young Zaphod Plays It Safe” and it is a waste of space in the text. But, that is a small quibble, and the story is short.I enjoyed the series, mostly, and I would recommend it to certain readers. For more specifics see below where you will find my  for all five of the novels in chronological order.1. “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy” is short and never gives much development (character or plot) but it seems appropriate for this tale. The novel reminds me a lot of Vonnegut in its style and presentation. Short chapters and biting satire mixed with fantastical plot devices. And it all works!The introduction and first chapter of this novel are funny and pull you into the book. There are moments that are so clever and witty that you will find yourself re-reading certain lines for no reason other than to enjoy them once again. Chapter 23 of the text (perhaps the book’s most famous) is brilliant and to the point. It is very short, funny, and kind of wise. Its opening line, “It is an important and popular fact that things are not often what they seem” could be a thematic statement for the book. One of the novel’s key devices is the idea that Earth is an experiment, and without revealing too much, I will say that it gives the novel its focus.Also enjoyable are the characters of Marvin the paranoid android and Eddie, the shipboard computer on “The Heart of Gold” (a spaceship that serves as the novel’s main setting). Some of the text’s best moments and lines belong to them, and I was more endeared to them than I was to the novel’s two human characters.“The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy” is a delightful and quick read and I will be continuing my trip through the galaxy with its sequel, “The Restaurant at the End of the Universe.”2. “The Restaurant at the End of the Universe” reads like a typical adventure tale, and it is more in this genre than its predecessor “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy”. The restaurant of the title is a place where the characters go and can literally watch the end of the Universe during dinner. Trust me, the way Mr. Adams explains it, it makes sense!The plot of the novel begins right where its predecessor left off, and the set up is that space psychiatrists plot to kill Arthur Dent and Trillian because they are the last survivors from Earth, which we found out in “Hitchhiker” was an experiment designed to answer the purpose of “Life, the universe, and everything.” The psychiatrists do not want that question answered because they would be out of business. And with this clever premise it is off to the races.In this delightful and quick romp of a novel we get to meet space psychiatrists, rock stars, and the ruler of the universe. And it goes without saying that none of it is as expected. The satire of the rock stars and bands is wonderful, as is the clever jab at rock stars that use to flee tax jurisdictions to record albums. In the book one mega space rock star even goes into “suspended death” for two years for the tax deductions.The last 20 pages of the book contain some pretty rough satire of modern professions and social dynamics. And then the text ends abruptly, like Mr. Adams was leading you into the next novel. It worked, because I will be continuing my journey with these hitchhikers. You should too!3. Of the three novels that I have read so far out of the five that compose the “Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy” series, “Life, the Universe and Everything” is the weakest, but it is still incredibly good. The whole book feels like a Monty Python sketch, but the first few chapters especially feel that way. It works, but it does get a little tiresome after a while.The humor in this text is mostly through wordplay. It serves the book well and is a strength of this novel because in terms of plot “Life, the Universe and Everything” is all over the place. The unity of the wordplay and humor serves to coalesce (as much as it can) a very scattered text. Especially enjoyable is a clever discourse on swear words, their usage and how they evolve and change. In the world of this novel the word “Belgium” is their equivalent of the F-word. This part of the novel is a witty piece of satirical writing, and is very enjoyable.There are two interesting bits in this novel I would like to share in this . The first is one of my favorite cameo appearances in this entire series thus far, the character of Wowbagger, the Infinitely Prolonged. He is an alien who through an accident has immortality and is bored to tears. So he makes it a mission to insult everyone in the Universe. His occasional appearances in this story are a joy. Another aspect of the text that I enjoyed is that the ultimate question and answer to everything remains unexplained. There is also a thinly veiled satire aimed at religious symbols where it seems Adams is mocking finding value in such things. It is an engaging section of the text.I will be moving on to the fourth book in this series soon. I have enjoyed this ride so far!4. This fourth novel in the series begins exactly as the first one, word for word, with one small twist. You can decide for yourself what you think of that twist. I did not care for it, as it shifts the focus in this text from the ones that preceded it. “So Long, and Thanks for all the Fish” begins with Arthur Dent back on earth, which is no longer destroyed (it was blown up in the first book of the series) but the explanation for how this is so is best glossed over if one wants to fully enter the world of the text. This novel does not feature the other characters from the previous three, so fans of Zaphod Beeblebrox and Trillian will be disappointed. Other series staples such as Ford Prefect and Marvin the Android make cameos in the novel’s final pages, but they seemed forced and not all that interesting in the context Mr. Adams uses here.This are some shining moments in this book, among them chapter 25 in which the author’s persona intrudes into the text to answer the question “Does Arthur Dent f-word?” We also get to see “God’s final message to His creation”, and it is actually not a letdown.At one point in the novel Arthur tells someone “See first, think later, then test” as the best way to approach something one does not fully comprehend. If you don’t take the last two parts of his advice while you are reading “So Long, and Thanks for all the Fish” you can enjoy the text.I am anxious to see how the series concludes in installment 5, and I will be traveling that way soon.5. ""Mostly Harmless"" is a great example of a writer extending a series by one book too many. Of the five books in the ""Hitchhiker"" series numbers four and five don't add much to it, and take a lot from it. ""Mostly Harmless"" just feels out of sync with the books that preceded it. Stylistically it is also very different, the chapters are much longer, the humor is much rarer, etc. It is not a good change.A big flaw of the text is that our hero Arthur Dent does not even show up until chapter seven, and even when he does there is no transition from how we left him in book four, ""So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish."" From chapter seven to almost the final 40 pages the chapters alternate point of view between Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect. I found Prefect's story boring until his storyline merges with Dent's about 3/4s of the way through the novel.The book does have some good moments, particularly chapter nine in which it finally feels like the other novels in the series. Arthur Dent goes to the planet Hawalius to seek the advice of the oracles that inhabit it. In this chapter we see sparks of the Douglas Adams from the previous texts and it is a joy to read. There is also a witty cameo appearance by Elvis, which is cleverly woven into the plotline.As has been stated in previous s ""Mostly Harmless"" is a dark text, almost nihilistic in its themes. The series ends in a uncharacteristic manner. Although as a reader I did not like the ending per se, I do feel it was kind of appropriate. It feels jarring and out of place at the same time. I can't say much more without spoiling it. Regardless it does give the series a sense of definite completion, and I think that is a good thing....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,not set,"Feb 18, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13.The_Ultimate_Hitchhiker_s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy

Stylistically it is also very different, the chapters are much longer, the humor is much rarer, etc. It is not a good change.A big flaw of the text is that our hero Arthur Dent does not even show up until chapter seven, and even when he does there is no transition from how we left him in book four, ""So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish."" From chapter seven to almost the final 40 pages the chapters alternate point of view between Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect. I found Prefect's story boring until his storyline merges with Dent's about 3/4s of the way through the novel.The book does have some good moments, particularly chapter nine in which it finally feels like the other novels in the series. Arthur Dent goes to the planet Hawalius to seek the advice of the oracles that inhabit it. In this chapter we see sparks of the Douglas Adams from the previous texts and it is a joy to read. There is also a witty cameo appearance by Elvis, which is cleverly woven into the plotline.As has been stated in previous s ""Mostly Harmless"" is a dark text, almost nihilistic in its themes. The series ends in a uncharacteristic manner. Although as a reader I did not like the ending per se, I do feel it was kind of appropriate. It feels jarring and out of place at the same time. I can't say much more without spoiling it. Regardless it does give the series a sense of definite completion, and I think that is a good thing....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Feb 18, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/569429.Mostly_Harmless

You can decide for yourself what you think of that twist. I did not care for it, as it shifts the focus in this text from the ones that preceded it. “So Long, and Thanks for all the Fish” begins with Arthur Dent back on earth, which is no longer destroyed (it was blown up in the first book of the series) but the explanation for how this is so is best glossed over if one wants to fully enter the world of the text. This novel does not feature the other characters from the previous three, so fans of Zaphod Beeblebrox and Trillian will be disappointed. Other series staples such as Ford Prefect and Marvin the Android make cameos in the novel’s final pages, but they seemed forced and not all that interesting in the context Mr. Adams uses here.This are some shining moments in this book, among them chapter 25 in which the author’s persona intrudes into the text to answer the question “Does Arthur Dent f-word?” We also get to see “God’s final message to His creation”, and it is actually not a letdown.At one point in the novel Arthur tells someone “See first, think later, then test” as the best way to approach something one does not fully comprehend. If you don’t take the last two parts of his advice while you are reading “So Long, and Thanks for all the Fish” you can enjoy the text.I am anxious to see how the series concludes in installment 5, and I will be traveling that way soon....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Feb 18, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/68355.So_Long_and_Thanks_for_All_the_Fish

The whole book feels like a Monty Python sketch, but the first few chapters especially feel that way. It works, but it does get a little tiresome after a while.The humor in this text is mostly through wordplay. It serves the book well and is a strength of this novel because in terms of plot “Life, the Universe and Everything” is all over the place. The unity of the wordplay and humor serves to coalesce (as much as it can) a very scattered text. Especially enjoyable is a clever discourse on swear words, their usage and how they evolve and change. In the world of this novel the word “Belgium” is their equivalent of the F-word. This part of the novel is a witty piece of satirical writing, and is very enjoyable.There are two interesting bits in this novel I would like to share in this . The first is one of my favorite cameo appearances in this entire series thus far, the character of Wowbagger, the Infinitely Prolonged. He is an alien who through an accident has immortality and is bored to tears. So he makes it a mission to insult everyone in the Universe. His occasional appearances in this story are a joy. Another aspect of the text that I enjoyed is that the ultimate question and answer to everything remains unexplained. There is also a thinly veiled satire aimed at religious symbols where it seems Adams is mocking finding value in such things. It is an engaging section of the text.I will be moving on to the fourth book in this series soon.

Really the myth just serves as a springboard for this excellent novel about love and faith and the life that one leads in between the extremes of both. This is a novel that needs to be read more than once, especially Part II of the text, in order to fully internalize what C.S. Lewis is doing in this piece.The novel is told from the perspective of Orual the older disfigured sister of Psyche. Through her relationship with her sister and other characters Lewis takes us on an exploration of faith and love and the healing and dangerous aspects of both of these powerful elements. The characterization of Orual and one of her soldiers Bardia (Orual becomes a powerful queen) and one of Orual's closest advisors and friends, known as the Fox, are some of the novel's highlights. Lewis' ability to characterize got better as he wrote, and this late novel of his shows him at the peak of his skills in that area.An unexpected highlight of the book is a scene where Orual explains how drunkenness allows her to ennoble her sorrows. You nod your head in agreement at this apt description of how being drunk can make one feel about their troubles. It is one of the best descriptions of this state as I have read in literature.""Till We Have Faces"" is divided into two parts and although the story is mythical it has much Christian significance, though less obvious (especially in Part I) than Lewis's other novels. There is a wonderful scene on pages 141-142 that mirrors what one must do in order to have some sort of belief system. It is subtle and well done. In Part II the text becomes more obvious as a Christian allegory but it works well in the context of the story Lewis has created and you could still read the text as a non-allegory and enjoy it.Although there are a couple of moments where the text seems to meander I liked this book quite a bit and I did not think I would when I picked it up. However, it quickly draws you in. Despite the fact that I am not sure that I agree with what C.S.

The restaurant of the title is a place where the characters go and can literally watch the end of the Universe during dinner. Trust me, the way Mr. Adams explains it, it makes sense!The plot of the novel begins right where its predecessor left off, and the set up is that space psychiatrists plot to kill Arthur Dent and Trillian because they are the last survivors from Earth, which we found out in “Hitchhiker” was an experiment designed to answer the purpose of “Life, the universe, and everything.” The psychiatrists do not want that question answered because they would be out of business. And with this clever premise it is off to the races.In this delightful and quick romp of a novel we get to meet space psychiatrists, rock stars, and the ruler of the universe. And it goes without saying that none of it is as expected. The satire of the rock stars and bands is wonderful, as is the clever jab at rock stars that use to flee tax jurisdictions to record albums. In the book one mega space rock star even goes into “suspended death” for two years for the tax deductions.The last 20 pages of the book contain some pretty rough satire of modern professions and social dynamics.

Clever at times and I chuckled frequently, but laugh out loud…not really. I think the performance dimension is what adds so much of the humor to this piece. The play reads okay, but again, I think it would come across as having more resonant themes in performance.A strength of the play is the characters, and how readily we buy into their rather stereotypical roles. Although the characters are broadly written, you do feel a familiarity with all of them at times. Especially frustrating (in a good way) are the moments where the characters, particularly Sonia and Vanya, express discontent with life. Mr. Durang does a nice job of getting you annoyed with their lack of appreciation for life on life’s terms. The funniest written character is the housekeeper / soothsayer Cassandra. Her “prophecies” are some of the highlights of the text.The play comes across as lacking however in some of its bigger moments. Vanya has a very long diatribe where he longs for the simplicity (as he imagines it) of the past. It has moments (some of them stellar) but overall it seems to fall just a little short. Another frustrating aspect of the piece is that many of the emotional transitions for the characters happen unrealistically fast, but such is the limitation of the genre.Overall “Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike” is an interesting read, and I believe would be an even more enjoyable performance.

I give this text kudos for simply being unique in that respect.The author, Jack Lynch, writes in a colloquial style aimed at connecting with the general reader and I appreciated that approach. He also does not arrange the book chronologically (examining how Shakespeare’s reputation grew over the last four centuries) but rather he examines the phenomenon of Shakespeare’s extraordinary ascent through topic. The text looks at how Shakespeare became the entity he is today by exploring these eight areas: reviving, performing, studying, improving, co-opting, domesticating, forging, and worshipping. Although some of these chapters are more valuable to proving Lynch’s thesis then others, none of them seem out of place in this book. Especially engaging is the chapter titled “Forging Shakespeare”.Another strength of this book is how Mr. Lynch keeps reminding his reader that Shakespeare was not one of us. He was a product of his time, and would not recognize our world. His determination to keep Shakespeare in his own time, and not co-opt him for a modern agenda is something many writers do not do.The Epilogue of “Becoming Shakespeare” (pages 273-280) is an interesting animal. The first 4.5 pages are just awful. They include a list of languages Shakespeare has been translated into. Seriously?

Katniss is full of contradiction and self doubt, which comes across as quite real. She is not portrayed as this pristine saint like young warrior, but rather as a young lady in a world gone made who is a bit of good and bad mixed together, as are most of us.I also enjoyed the abruptness of the text. Major characters die and are gone, and there is not time to analyze, over think, or remonstrate on the death. That is a realistic approach to death, and especially death in wartime. Some readers are upset at this, but I think it is one of the novel’s stronger aspects. Life is not like a movie, and rarely are things as convenient and pretty as we would like them to be.One ridiculous aspect of the text is a major moment at the novel’s climax that just comes across as cheap. I won’t say what it is here, but the moment deserves more setup than the author allows it. Katniss is so considered in everything she does, and in this one key moment you sense the author being the author, as opposed to an authentic moment for the character. Regardless, it is exciting to read, even if you are rolling your eyes.The last chapter of “Mockingjay” may be too introspective and slow for some readers, but I think it forces the reader to take a breath and consider the implications of the ideas brought up in this world that Ms. Collins has created. It is a considered and thoughtful conclusion to this novel, and it works.The Hunger Games is an enjoyable series, and has some wonderful moments. If it gets people to read I will not complain.

The trap is that it is not as funny and interesting as the comedians are when performing on their home turf. Tina Fey is a great writer for television and her humor is funny and smart. And “Bossypants” is that, at times. But not as often as the over praising s would have you believe.The text really shines in the chapter that deals with Fey’s experience on her television show “30 Rock”. Also quite good is when she writes about how she feels about breastfeeding. They are among the best moments in the book. The writing and humor seems unforced and works well in these sections. Other interesting parts include the chapter about her father, whose strong influence and love for his daughter is palpable. For hearing the classic Fey voice, her “Mother’s Prayer” is Ms. Fey firing on all cylinders.However, the text just seems unfocused. I still don’t see how the title is appropriate, and there are other portions of the book that just seem out of place.

The ambiguity and gaps in her stories are intriguing and well done. But a whole book of them is too much of a good thing. I would recommend that you don’t read “The Lottery and Other Stories” as a whole book, but rather that you read a couple of stories, put the text down and read another book, then pick it back up and read a couple more and so on until the collection is finished. If not, the text gets wearisome, as Jackson’s stories (at least in this collection) are variations of the same theme.Ms. Jackson does an amazing job at quickly establishing character and a sense of place / environment in every story. The worlds that she creates (with a very economic use of prose) are real as can be and leap off of the page.I found Part One of the text to be very intriguing.

I have read “The Lottery” a dozen times over the years and each time some different little detail in the text chills me to my core. I have never read this piece without being disturbed.

The last 100 pages or so are far superior to the first 100, so don’t give up in the early going. The text is fine, but the early chapters seem like the characters are pontificating, some of them are, and the writing can be a little wooden. This is partly due to the fact that Mr. Shaara is establishing character, and due to the book’s formatting. The novel is set out in chapters from alternating viewpoints, and it works, but it takes time to get into the stride.The text is divided in four parts, each one dealing with a specific day from June 29th to July 3rd 1863. The last two sections are easily the most engaging, and once you get to that point in the book you will plow through it. The section on July 2nd 1863 contains a nice scene where union troops encounter a black man for the first time. It feels quaint and dated and yet accurate and honest at the same time. The chapter dealing with Joshua L. Chamberlain’s defense of Little Round Top on the second day of the battle of Gettysburg is excellent writing, and will keep the reader completely in the moment.The novel’s final part, July 3rd 1863, is easily the strongest aspect of the book. Mainly because it focuses mostly on the novel’s two best drawn characters, Joshua Chamberlain and James Longstreet. Longstreet’s last chapter in the text is gut wrenching and beautiful. If there was a hero for the Confederacy at Gettysburg Shaara paints him as that man. Shaara also does a nice job in Chamberlain’s last chapter in foreshadowing the great warrior that Joshua L. Chamberlain was to become in the remainder of the war. He gets enjoyment from the carnage of war, and is troubled and titillated by it. This complex emotional life is well drawn by the author.Ironically, one of the least interesting characters in the text is Robert E. Lee and the chapters from his perspective are the most exasperating in the book. Perhaps that is because his decisions at Gettysburg seem so obviously bad from our vantage point, but I think it is also because he is such a poorly written character in this novel. Regardless, there are plenty of counterbalances to the chapters dealing with him. Especially the chapter detailing Pickett’s Charge, which is told from the perspective of one of Pickett’s brigade commanders, Lew Armistead. That chapter is among the book’s best. It is thrilling, harrowing, and immediate writing.“The Killer Angels” is a book for people interested in historical fiction, and especially the Civil War. I am not sure that it you don’t already have an interest in those things that this novel would spark it. But it might.

The text itself will not create one in you, you must come to it predisposed to lap up the material it contains. And it contains a lot.The first chapter of the book sets the general historical scene and gives insight into the daily English life and structure of the 1400/1500s. It is a nice way to ease the reader into the immersive world this text contains. “The War of the Roses” is written in a colloquial style and Ms. Weir occasionally intersperses references to current English events or geography. This device is used sparingly enough to not be distracting. The text is also as easy to follow as these difficult and complex aspects of English history can be made to appear.Some small quibbles with the text include the handwritten copies of the genealogies of families involved. They are poorly conceived and small print, and therefore rarely of any real use to the reader. There are also some maps included in the text, but they are not marked by county, district, etc. This can be confusing to the American reader who has no concept of where Wales is, or what Northumberland might mean. Another issue is Weir’s inconsistent use of names. She will call someone by their family/ birth name, and then on the same page refer to them by their titled name. For instance, “Bob Smith” might also be the “Earl of Whatever”, and she refers to him as both. A consistent usage would have been preferred. As titles were changed capriciously by the King (There were a gazillion Dukes of Somerset, etc.)I would have preferred a consistent use of people’s given Christian names. It would have decreased temporary moments of confusion.One thing “The War of the Roses” aptly demonstrates is that reality is always more complex and larger than life than fiction. Margaret of Anjou, Henry VI, Edward the IV and others will leap off of the page as easily as characters in a fiction, and that is what ultimately makes this book such an enjoyable experience....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,not set,"Feb 18, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/20828755-the-wars-of-the-roses

It is also not a biography of the man from Stratford. Rather it is a work that focuses on the plays and the period that produced them.Parts 1-5 of the text deal with English history, the land itself, the times, and how Shakespeare as a citizen might have related to all of the above. It is succinctly written and contains interesting nuggets about the time period, but really breaks no new ground. However, Mr. Kermode stresses that we can only guess as to how Shakespeare related to the events of his times, and I appreciated his constant reminding the reader of that fact.In Part 6, titled “Early Shakespeare”, the book switches course, and Kermode focuses on the plays individually, and how the events depicted in them connect (if at all) with what was happening historically. The chapter titled “Plays at the Globe” is mainly a play by play analysis of the works Shakespeare wrote in the first ten years of the Globe’s operation. It is interesting, if you have read these plays. If you haven’t then I suspect you would be lost and/or bored. This section includes a wonderfully insightful bit on “Love’s Labor Lost” that gives an interesting context to this difficult play. Kermode’s writing on “King Lear” is also especially strong and makes some connections within the text that I had not seen before. It is in these aspects that “The Age of Shakespeare” finds its greatest worth.The book ends abruptly, which is jarring, but Kermode’s style is concise and to the point. He rarely elaborates or makes commentary.

There is not a single transition to be found in the text. It is also inexcusably poorly edited and proofread. This is more ironic considering that on page 168 Ms. Schulman says that one of the major rules for press agents is and I quote, “No typos”. Was that meant to be a joke, because I sure laughed at that one? There are also these intermittent red boxes of text strewn throughout the book that are mini digressions from whatever yarn she was just spinning. They are banal, and poorly placed.Now as to the contents of the text, to be blunt, it reads like a juvenile wrote it. It is filed with immature thoughts and reflections. There are times; too many, that Ms. Schulman just wants us to think that she is a celebrity by proxy. She also overinflates the role of a press agent in the hierarchy of this world. They are important, yes, but rarely in the manner that she depicts.One interesting facet of the text was the bit about the Broadway bomb “Dream” starring the delusional Lesley Ann Warren. Schulman gets her revenge on this egomaniac in this book.Inexplicably there are 10 pages of text about what a press agent does. I don’t mean an overview of the profession, but lists.

Having just recently read it I am surprised that my reaction to seeing it and reading it about 2 years apart was almost the same.The second act of this play is by far the strongest, mainly because the protagonist of Brooke Wyeth is put in her place a little. She is a whiny, arrogant woman, who pretty much blames her troubles in life on a brother’s suicide (which she blames on her parents) that happened two plus decades in the past. Not to diminish the significance of such an event, but come on, grow up. In the theater at intermission I recall talking to the lady next to me about how much I disliked the character of Brooke. I am still not sure if she is a hero to Jon Robin Baitz, or if my reaction to her is what he intended. I view that ambiguity as a strength of the text.Regardless, the dialogue in “Other Desert Cities” brims with wit and the darts that this family sometimes fire at each other have the ring of true familial interactions. The best drawn character in the play, and the meatiest role, is the matriarch of the Wyeth family, Polly. It is a well written role, and when played by a strong actress (I saw Stockard Channing in the part) it dominates the play.“Other Desert Cities” is an enjoyable and thought provoking read, and you will not waste your time in picking up this text. Like the best dramas it fiddles with the audience’s emotions and loyalties, and you will find yourself alternating between liking and despising (with the exception of the all around likable son, Trip Wyeth) the five characters that people this family.

This short text, only 178 pages long, captures everything that was good about Capote as a writer. Although the four pieces in this book are unrelated, there is a consistent theme that runs through all of them. The inescapability of loneliness and the human desire for companionship is a theme that permeates each of these four selections. It is a universal and powerful connection that every reader can relate with.The text starts out with the wonderful novella “Breakfast at Tiffany’s”. The first half of this story is some of the best character writing I have ever encountered. The character of Holly Golightly leaps off of the page, as do even relatively minor characters like Joe Bell the bartender. This novella is filled with real living breathing people, and its power is found in that fact. Rarely have I been drawn to a character as much as I was to Holly Golightly. Ironically she is a person who I don’t admire, but she is infused with that indomitable human spirit, and won my heart in the end. “Breakfast at Tiffany’s” is also strengthened by how much Capote leaves unsaid. Nothing is ever bluntly stated in this novella, rather it relies on gaps which create intrigue that further pulls the reader into the world of the story.The second piece in this text is the story “House of Flowers”. It is unlike any Capote I have ever read. It is set in Haiti and although it is a fine story, and well written, I found it to be the weak link in the book. Mind you that being the weak link in this collection means it is still an excellent piece of fiction.“A Diamond Guitar” is a powerful story, and one that I was unfamiliar with. It is a rather unconventional story dealing with love and loneliness. It takes place in a southern prison farm and anyone who has been used by another person, yet still can’t shake their love for the person that hurt them, will identify with this piece. Some of the most abstract human emotions are artfully, and realistically, rendered in this selection.The text ends with the sentimental, and one of the best short stories ever written, “A Christmas Memory”. The economy of the prose, the power of the language, and the simplicity of the emotional life of the story make me teary eyed every time I read it. It is simply beautiful.“Breakfast at Tiffany’s and Three Stories” is a quintessential text, by one of the best American writers of the twentieth century.

The most moving aspects are the moments in the text when the focus is on loneliness and the need for friendship.“Albert of Adelaide” is a typical surface level western. What has made it stand out for people is that its main character is a platypus and the other characters are all animals in the Australian Outback. So my question is how does changing the characters from human to animal enhance the book? Other novels with animal protagonists use that device to enhance understanding of some human trait or serve as satire of humanity. This novel does neither. It has some heavy handed moments, one such example being how dingoes become a metaphor for aborigines or Native Americans. Thought to be one thing, but really just a misunderstood culture, blah blah...okay we get it.I think this novel had a lot of potential. As it stands it is just a fun read with some shallow metaphor thrown in to make you think a little.

These themes can often come across in literature as didactic and dull. Vonnegut does not do that in this text, he never preaches. He just presents an idea and you see it one way, or you see it another.

When it was picked for my book club I read it, and I am glad that I did. The idea for the story is great. Putting aside the faith based aspect of the Christ story, what would a mother think of her son in the circumstances that surrounded the last three year of Jesus’ life? I believe that Colm Toibin has done a good job at taking a story that is known by most, and making parts of it seem new.First off, the text is beautifully written. Astoundingly so at times. I would place an example here, but there are plenty in the text. Read it and find some for yourself. It is told in first person, as if Mary is recounting her version of events. The plotting and pacing of the book are also well done. It is only 81 pages long, and frankly that is one of its strengths. Had it been longer I don’t think the text would have the impact that it does.After hearing about the miracle of the resurrection of Lazarus, and witnessing the turning of water into wine for herself, Mary spends the three years of Jesus’ ministry in near isolation in her home and only hears snippets of the events going on with her son. This device keeps the focus on her, as opposed to Jesus, and her motherly disapproval of what she hears about and her worries over the attention that her son is receiving ring true as motherly actions. Her perspective as his mother adds a tension to these well known stories. The wedding where Jesus turns the water into wine is nerve-racking, mainly because of how Mary herself views the proceedings.There is also a good device in the invented character of Marcus, Mary’s childhood friend, through whom she hears details of her son’s doings. Marcus makes very practical observations about the events the novel portrays. Another strong element is the characterization of Mary and Martha, the sisters of Lazarus. Mary is a convert, someone who believes in the message Jesus delivers. Martha is practical (like Mary Jesus’ mother) and is more concerned about the dangers that Jesus’ ministry is putting all of them in. The contrast is well written, and gives the novel a sense of realism.Toibin also incorporates, in subtle manner, the inklings of the patriarchy that were to be a hallmark of early Christianity. They are presented in the context of the story, and never remarked on, but they are undeniably there. It is a clever touch.Mary’s version of the crucifixion is heartrending. I held my breath as a mother watched the murder of her son. The simplicity and honesty in which her character delivers the details of this event is a very strong facet of the book.I am a Christian and I was not offended by this text. I viewed it as an interesting piece of fiction. It is a good novella, and boasts some of the best writing I have read in years.

E.L. Doctorow uses the names Homer and Langley Collyer, but“Homer & Langley” is an interesting text that many readers mislabel as historical fiction. E.L. Doctorow uses the names Homer and Langley Collyer, but almost nothing else in the text is related to the actual historical brothers. Their family, their acquaintances, their life spans, etc. are completely fictionalized. And that is great, but some readers seem to quibble with that fact. This text is a work of fiction and it is not meant to be read as anything other than that.The novel is written from the perspective of Homer Collyer, and is written as if Homer is looking back on the life he and his brother have shared and is examining its contents. There are no chapters in the book, and Homer delivers his memories in mostly chronological order. It is a great device because Doctorow brilliantly weaves the brothers growing eccentricities into the text with subtlety that creeps up on the reader. The Collyer brother’s hermit and hoarder lifestyle slowly moves up on them and you. They have become something they never set out to be, and by the time it is noticeable it is too late. They and the reader have been trapped. The characterization change happens right in front of you and you don’t even notice it. About 100 pages into the text I went, “Wow, where did this change come from?” It was there all along, and slowly being absorbed in it is one of the pleasures of this novel.A highlight of the text is the section where Homer admits his longing for a lover, and his feelings of loneliness (brought on by the lifestyle he and his brother have chosen). It is wonderfully written and Doctorow put this basic, abstract human emotion into words that are actually up to the task of explaining it. That is a very rare feat, and as a result that section is very moving.“Homer & Langley” sneaks up on you and is a quiet joy. The book ends on a lovely note and the last ten pages are some of the best writing I have come across in Doctorow’s novels. The delight of this text is in the reader knowing that Doctorow is manipulating them with a decently interesting plot, and top notch writing. Knowing you are being seduced, and not wanting to stop it makes “Homer & Langley” a worthwhile excursion....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,not set,"Feb 18, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6324914-homer-langley

For the most part it is, and the idea of asking notable writers, actors, scholars, directors, etc. to write something about Shakespeare and then compiling those articles into a single text is a nice idea.The text opens with a characteristic Intro written by Harold Bloom. The intro tends to be more about Mr. Bloom than Mr. Shakespeare, and it is both frustrating and interesting to read. So typical of Harold Bloom, there should be no surprises there.I approached the book not as a single set piece, but as individual essays. Therefore I would read a few essays at a time, then put the text down and read something else. Once that book was completed, I would return to read a few more essays from “Living with Shakespeare” and so on until I had the text completed. I think reading it in this fashion will allow you to dialogue with, and digest the ideas in the text more easily then reading it in one continuous cycle.The book is full of many hits and misses. I will focus first on the book’s weaknesses, and then finish with its strengths. Notable among the worst of the essays in the collection are the ones by Cicely Berry-a very dull and self serving piece, and James Earl Jones’ essay which is filled with ludicrous ideas and choppy didactic writing. Mr. Jones writes about “Othello”, and the text has a total of three essays about that play. None of them are any good, and the editor should have tossed them. They appear in a row, and they really drag the collection down. Two other big letdowns are the essays by James Franco (more mystifying than his Oscar host performance) and Julie Taymor. Both are narcissistic and uninteresting.However, there is more to celebrate about this text than to complain. “Living with Shakespeare” opens with a bang with a brilliant and simplistically profound essay by Bill Willingham about storytelling. I also enjoyed many of the essays by actors, especially Rory Kinnear’s (very interesting) and Brian Cox’s scholarly yet easy to consume piece called “I Say it is the Moon”. Mr. Cox’s essay breaks new ground and is very accessible. It is a highlight of the text. Especially surprising was the essay “What’s in a Name?” by James Prosek. Mr. Prosek is known primarily as a nature writer, but he produces one of the best essays in the book. The collection also ends as well as it began with the writer Isabel Allende writing an appropriately sentimental and lovely piece.One last recommendation, most of the essays assume a familiarity with much of Shakespeare’s work. This is not a text for someone not well versed in the plays.“Living with Shakespeare” is an interesting contribution to the canon of books about Shakespeare.

I thought it had depth.Having read it seven months after seeing it, I am not sure that it holds up so well. It is a fine piece, enjoyable and funny at times. But I did not find it all that profound or especially well written. It is a decent play, but not a great one, and there are many others you can read with much more to chew on.There are five characters in ""Seminar"", and only three that have much development. The premise is that four writers pay a formerly successful writer to teach a private writing seminar. The main character, Leonard, is intriguing to the reader, and in performance is certainly dominant, but I feel that was due to the fact that Alan Rickman was playing Leonard when I saw it. I wonder if he would be as dominant, and important, a factor in the play with a weaker performer. Leonard does not leap off the page when you read ""Seminar"". Since he is the teacher who the other four charters revolve around that can present a problem.I don't mean to insinuate that I did not like reading ""Seminar"", I did. However, it is a good play; it is not a great one. I enjoyed watching it, enjoyed reading it. It is quick in performance, and on the page. However, don't read it thinking it is a brilliant piece of modern drama, or you will be disappointed. It has moments, for instance there is a great monologue that ends scene eight that leaps off the page, and is the finest writing in the play.

By 1968, when this collection was published, Vonnegut was a famous writer and this collection was put together to capitalize on his fame. Unlike some of the posthumous short story collections that have been thrown together since his death, this short story collection is worth reading. I am not a huge fan of the genre of the short story, and there are a few in this collection that left me feeling nothing. However, those blah stories are outweighed by some of the magnificent short fiction in this book. For the purpose of this  I am going to mention a few highlights from the text.The title story in the collection is subversively powerful. It uses sex as a metaphor for choice and freedom in life, and it works on a lot of levels. I believe that this story speaks more powerfully to this generation (for a variety of reasons) then it would have when originally published in 1968.I think the best piece in this collection is the stunningly beautiful and heartbreaking story ""D.P."". Only Vonnegut could write a sentence like, ""Peter was the oldest boy in the orphanage, an embittered old man of fourteen..."" which makes you grin and get misty eyed simultaneously. The opening paragraph of this story is one of the saddest in all of literature. A brilliant piece of writing!The story ""Unready to Wear"", like the best science fiction, examines the very basic assumptions of human life with a very interesting twist. In a completely different vein, the piece ""Long Walk to Forever"" is simply lovely and well written. The whole text bounces all over the place in terms of themes and plot contrivances.Ironically one of the more prophetic stories in this collection has to do with education and how kids are raised. ""The Kid Nobody Could Handle"" should be taught in every school. Its message (which like the best Vonnegut is so simple) is more needed today than ever.Although not as strong as his novels, ""Welcome to the Monkey House"" is a necessary read for any fan of Vonnegut, if for no other reason than to see the variety on display.

It has no discernable plot; it is merely snippets of moments in a young Jewish boy's life in New York City in the 1930s. It is a very detailed work; E.L. Doctorow creates the sense of place vividly. You are there when he describes something.The book is told from the perspective of Edgar Altschuler, a young man looking back on details of his youth. Of the text's 31 chapters all are from his point of view with the exception of four from his mother's (Rose), two from his brother (Donald), and one from his aunt (Frances). I only mention this because when Doctorow shifts the perspective, albeit briefly, it increases the scope of the text and makes the story that much richer. When these seven chapters are interspersed in the book they are written as if the character whose point of view we are getting is telling their perspective to the adult Edgar, who is our guide in this tale. The interspersion creates a nice contrast in the text, and is a good technique as employed here.""World's Fair"" is a beautifully written book, but it is also fair to say that at times it is overwritten. However, when the writing is as good as this is you mostly don't care about that. Doctorow does an amazing job of capturing how a child sees and interprets things. You really live inside the mind of a young boy. You will recognize Edgar's way of thinking from your own childhood. It is an astounding feat, and a real testament to the greatness of this book.A highlight of the novel is chapters 28 & 29, which feature Edgar going to the 1939 World's Fair, and it is magical. The writing soars at this point and the reader will find they are as enthralled as this nine year old boy is at the wonders that he beholds. It is edge of your seat reading, and you will not put the book down in the middle of these two chapters, I assure you!One of the critical blurbs on the cover of the novel perfectly captures this text, so I will end my  with it.

Consider this simile describing childbirth, ""Like a tadpole winnowing out of a cocktail straw."" A brilliant and perfect way to describe that act!The novel is written in a mishmash of styles, and one can see elements of an epic oral history, an ancient folktale, and a very modern colloquial tone throughout the text. Sometimes the style changes in midsentence, and it works. I loved how Robbins inserted the persona of the author into the text at the most intriguing moments.A weakness in this piece is an insipid reference to 9/11. It comes up in the last quarter of the book, and I don't see the purpose, other than for Robbins to settle some political scores. It doesn't serve the story, and thus I found it cheap and out of place. In the last 60 pages of the book the tone gets a little too didactic, and some of the characters wax a little too philosophical, and as a result the novel develops a smug tone. It is not overbearing, but it is there.However, the strengths outweigh the bad in this novel, and there are many. I will mention just a few here. One is a dissertation on mayonnaise that a character delivers. It is a lovely and unexpected moment in the story. The book is also aided by the apt job that Robbins does in switching between plotlines and locales with ease, ultimately linking them in rather unexpected, but oddly logical, manners.A highlight of the text is on page 151, when a character discourses on how being a ""true believer"" stops us from really living.

""The Fourth Hand"" is not awful; it is just not that good. It is much shorter than Irving's other novels, in fact he has only one shorter, and although the text is 313 pages it seems that Irving does not know how to construct a novel in that amount of space.I thought the protagonist, a news anchor named Patrick Wallingford, was not that interesting a character. I found the most intriguing and well defined character to be the secondary character of a famous surgeon, Dr. Zajac. The highlight of the text is the second chapter, which focuses exclusively on Dr. Zajac (the only chapter of the book to do so) and it was where I first started getting interested in the novel. The first chapter certainly did not achieve that effect! With Dr. Zajac Irving creates a wonderfully full and believable life for a secondary character. No other part of the text came as close to pulling me in as the sections of the book where Zajac and his storyline took focus.There are moments where this novel is quite good, but it never fulfills its promise (if it ever had much promise, which is debatable). The premise never seems to leave the ground. ""The Fourth Hand"" also suffers from too much variance in tone. It starts off in a rather comic vein, and then the tone shifts and drifts into melancholy and the transition just does not work for me.All in all a decent novel (mostly) but not one I ever feel the need to revisit. It has not earned a place on my bookshelf. However, there is a moment on page 289 that will long stick with me. A character realizes the personal nature of one's attachment to books and movies and Irving writes of this with a simplicity and sincerity that I wish the rest of the novel employed. ""But books, and sometimes movies, are more personal than that; they can be mutually appreciated, but the specific reasons for loving them cannot satisfactorily be shared.""...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Feb 18, 2016",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4656.The_Fourth_Hand

It is a uniquI, like many people, had read some of the pieces in ""Spoon River Anthology"" in college, but I have to recommend reading the entire work. It is a unique and very fulfilling experience. Edgar Lee Masters' greatest work was published as a unified whole in 1915 and is 244 individual poems, each from the perspective of a different dead person in the cemetery. Their name serves as the poem's title. Woven throughout the 244 pieces are 19 stories that are pieced together through interwoven portraits from the dead. It is a different and surprisingly accessible way to create a history of a town and its people.With only a handful of obtuse and esoteric pieces, the vast majority of the poems are easily understood and interesting. Their themes run the gamut of possibilities, and ""Spoon River Anthology"" is an excellent choice for book clubs. The text continually reminds us of the variety of perspectives every event in a community or family engenders and one of the joys of the text is seeing how different people interpreted and reacted to the same events. Great examples are the contrasting pomes of ""Albert Schrding"" and ""Jonas Keene"" which beautifully demonstrate how one's attitude and perspective affects the events of our lives.One criticism I have heard readers level at this book is that it is so dark and that none of the people were happy in life. While I agree that a lot of the pieces in the text are dark, bitter, and weary in their tone I don't think that Masters is being nihilistic about life. Rather I think he is pointing the finger at us and telling us that we take this gift and make it that way by our thoughts and actions. There are harsh pieces in this text, especially the ""Indignation Jones"" and ""Minerva Jones"" pieces. They resound with the cruelties of life. Abortion is even rather openly addressed which I was surprised to find considering the time of publication. However for every dark storyline, like Indignation and Minerva's, there is a poem like ""Fiddler Jones"" which resounds with the love and joys of life.There are lots of great moments in this text, my favorite being the wonderful poem ""Lucinda Matlock"" which is one of the most encouraging and uplifting poems in all of literature. It extols the simple joys of life, and finds satisfaction enough in that.There are many pieces I could talk about, but you need to decide on your own which poems and characters speak to you. I will conclude by saying that the ""Epilogue"" will need to be reread. There is an elusive beauty and depth to it that a second reading will open up. It is a fine ending to this masterwork....more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,not set,not set,"Feb 18, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2554483.Spoon_River_Anthology

It certainly warrants a rerHaving read ""Measure for Measure"" for the first time, I have the feeling it is one of Shakespeare's more subversive plays. It certainly warrants a rereading, and I think there are a myriad of ways to look at this piece.By the way, I give ""Measure for Measure"" a 4 star rating compared to other Shakespeare, not to literature as a whole. The Bard is in a class of his own.Many readers say this is a morality tale, but I don't buy that. Mainly because the morals that most of the characters pretend to have do not translate into their being good people. Rather, I think this play is Shakespeare warning us that a moral code is only powerful if used in decent ways, and even then when we feel the need to impose it on others we are setting ourselves up for a fall.One of the most interesting aspects of ""Measure for Measure"" is the character of Duke Vincentio, a character ripe for many interpretations. The Duke is often remembered as the guy who gives a wonderful speech in Act 3:1 to a condemned man in which he utters the famous ""Reason thus with life: if I do lose thee, I do lose a thing that none but fools would keep."" Frankly I feel that this speech is mainly devoid of any real comfort or content, despite the fact that it is a nihilistic (and perhaps accurate) view of our human nature in regards to death. I say I find it empty because I don't feel like it is the Duke's authentic truth, rather he is spouting off words that he feels he is supposed to say since he is in disguise as a friar at the moment. And that is the key to this play; words devoid of meaning destroy so much of value.As a reader a lot of my joy in this play came in the exchanges between the bawd Lucio and the disguised Duke. There is a lot to these scenes, more than just the obvious (and funny) humor. In Act 3:2 Shakespeare has written a scene between these two that plays on so many levels. There is a sexual subtext, the disbelief of one friend finding out what another really thinks of him, and the pangs of realizing that a relationship might not be what you thought it was. It gives the readers and the actors a lot to play with.Lucio is a fun character, an ingratiating slime ball always looking out for number one. He is a joy to read, although I would be loathe to know him in real life. Similarly the Duke is a character I also have mixed feelings about. He can be viewed as a man secretly trying to do good deeds, or as someone quite malevolent and manipulative. Neither character is someone I would trust very far.Although the themes of ""Measure for Measure"" are ambiguous at best, and what Shakespeare was trying to do is not easily solidified, the play holds many joys and the reader will experience great glee as they watch the Duke setting up the pious hypocrite Angelo for a comeuppance he richly deserves. Shakespeare also creates a brilliant character named Barnadine, a murderer, who appears in one brief scene. He is a wonderful creation, and ironically, probably the most honest character in the play.""Measure for Measure"" does not deserve the label of a ""problem play"", so do not let that dissuade you from reading and enjoying it.As for the Pelican Shakespeare series, they are my favorite editions as the scholarly research is usually top notch and the editions themselves look good as an aesthetic unit. It looks and feels like a play and this compliments the text's contents admirably. The Pelican series was recently reedited and has the latest scholarship on Shakespeare and his time period.

The text supports both claims, and it is interesting to see how one's reading of the play changes when one makes a decision about the nature of their relationship.Another highlight is the wonderful character of Shylock who, although he is actually a secondary character, dominates the play. At first glance Shylock comes across as a stereotype, but there is much more to him, and I find him to be one of the most painful characters in all of Shakespeare to read. Shylock is who he is because of the anti-Semitism that he has endured his entire life. In fact, his final fate I find to be cruel. Others say he gets what he deserves. Again, your perspective changes your reading of this text.I could go on... is Portia (the female lead) a hypocrite? She eloquently pleas for mercy, and then denies it to someone just a few moments later. Is the rule of law more important than justice? Is love worth jettisoning your heritage? Shakespeare asks all these questions in this wonderful play, and gives no definitive answers. That is the main joy of ""The Merchant of Venice"".As for the Pelican Shakespeare series, they are my favorite editions as the scholarly research is usually top notch and the editions themselves look good as an aesthetic unit. It looks and feels like a play and this compliments the text's contents admirably. The Pelican series was recently reedited and has the latest scholarship on Shakespeare and his time period. Well priced and well worth it....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Feb 17, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/286796.The_Merchant_of_Venice

It lacks some of the subtleties and clever plot devices of some of his more mature works. However, the environmental message (a constant in Hiaasen's books) is more muted than his more recent efforts. I appreciate that as it makes the text less preachy and smug.This book is an enjoyable read, but not quite as quick a read as most of his others. It starts off well, and then slows down, eventually ending with a weak fizz of a climax.For avid Hiaasen fans all of his staple devices are there: the rape of the environment by greedy people, needless violence, and some humor. The story lags mainly because the characterization is weaker than in some of his other novels.However, it is the first novel of Hiaasen's where the villains are not all uniformly painted as unlikable stereotypes. In fact, the ending seems a little weak because Hiaasen tries to get us to feel a little sympathy and admiration for the novel's villain because he is motivated by environmental concern.

It is also very hard to find, and so I am assuming it is out of print. The novel is entertaining, at times, but it is not as gripping as some other Buckley books I have read. It is also about 30 pages too long. Frankly, it is a story I could have walked away from and felt no remorse.""Wet Work"" is essentially a revenge fest in the vein of Shakespeare's early play ""Titus Andronicus"", and like that early work of the Bard it suffers from weak characterization with a protagonist who is a mash up of Charles Bronson, and every revenge film you have ever seen. There is really no depth to the story, which hinders it because you are supposed to believe that the protagonist is taking his revenge on the drug cartels due to his overwhelming love for his granddaughter. I was not too bothered by this, but if you are expecting more than a surface level text you will be disappointed by this book.To its credit the novel moves quickly (mostly) and is a very easy read. Buckley does shift point of view often and it sometimes results in temporary confusion because the transitions in the text are choppy and don't flow.Yet, ""Wet Work"" is a nice summer read. However, it does lack the wit and comedy of Buckley's more recent output. This text is not a humorous satire and seems out of character when compared with what later became Christopher Buckley's trademark style. That huge difference can be jarring for regular readers of his novels.

By the way, my 3.5 star rating is in comparison to books written in a similar vein, not to literature as a whole.There are many alternating points of view in this novel. Tim Dorsey seems to have a pattern. One book follows Serge almost exclusively (as this novel's predecessor did) and the next will follow several characters, usually recurring characters from previous books.""Atomic Lobster"" sees the return of the wallflower Jim Davenport and his wife Martha. They were featured in Dorsey's earlier novel ""Triggerfish Twist"". They serve as a nice contrast to the antics of Serge and Coleman, and Serge's devotion to Jim is funny, and oddly endearing. There is also a surprise twist with one of them at the novel's end that I did not even remotely see coming.As is typical for a Dorsey book there is a lot of humor, much of it off color, and slapstick. A few examples to share: on page 140 there is a section where Serge discourses on alpha males. It is funny, and as a guy it has for me just a few rings of truth in it. Chapter 46 of the text is a brilliantly fast paced farce straight out of the Marx Brothers or the television series ""Frasier"". It is filled with opening and slamming doors, near misses, and all of that fun stuff that is hysterical when done well.The novel ends with a pandemonium filled finale on a cruise ship. It makes the last 50 pages fly by. It is a little contrived, but fun, as Dorsey brings all of the novel's subplots together for a satisfying falling action and tidy resolution.I look forward to this series of books every summer as my beach reads.

T""No Stems, no seeds, I'm a pig in slop"" say the character Coleman in ""Hurricane Punch"" and the same can be said for the reader of this twisted tale. The best books in Tim Dorsey's Serge A. Storms series are those where the humor is in high gear and the plot contrivances simple and straightforward. This text is a prime example of that formula!""Hurricane Punch"" opens with a great letter to the editor that Serge writes. Within a few pages you know this text is better than some previous efforts in this series. Dorsey brings back noir detective Agent Mahoney and I enjoy the little details Dorsey includes to round out this character. We are also introduced to a new character, Jeff McSwirley, a sensitive wimpy crime beat reporter who cries incessantly about the events he reports. Dorsey uses both of these characters in a clever way in the text.A thread in ""Hurricane Punch"" is that 44 year old Serge is undergoing a midlife crisis. The midlife crisis includes a religious search that is hysterical. Serge searches for a belief system that he can buy into, and his journey is a highlight of the novel. Plus, it actually makes some interesting points to boot. Serge's journey also includes an encounter with him returning to the Catholic Church, and Serge's confession (128-131 in the book) is brilliantly funny! Laugh out loud. Again, Dorsey seamlessly weaves this plot twist into the larger story outline in a satisfying manner.An interesting observation about this series (this is the ninth book) is that as it progresses Serge is becoming a man who has a rather high moral code, almost an idealistic one. Yet he can be very unstable, and is a serial killer. It is weird to root for a killer to escape detection, but you find yourself doing just that. Dorsey has given Serge boundless energy and enthusiasm for life, and it is joyful to read. The novel even ends with Serge exclaiming, ""Remember the key to life...always act like you deserve to be here.""""Hurricane Punch"" will increase your laugher and joy, and thus it is a fun read and a great choice for the pool or beach.

I recently picked it up, and at first I thought I might have been given bad advice. I had read two other Michael Chabon books many years ago, and they were okay but they did not leave me panting to pick up more of his work. That, combined with the heft of ""The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay"" made me leery of the text.For the first 50 pages I was regretting my reading choice as Chabon's vocabulary can be pretentious, and after a while it gets wearisome. I kept thinking for those first few chapters that this was an interesting story, but boring writing. The contradiction was leaving me wanting.And then a combination of things happened! I got use to the stylistic choices of the author, the story kicked into high gear, and maybe I just got pulled into this well developed world and characters. Regardless of how it happened, I found myself hooked! ""The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay"" is a long novel, but I was propelled from that point on though its pages. As mentioned, the first 50 pages are rough and then you find you are caught up in the text and don't know how it happened.When the novel's protagonists, Joe Kavalier and Sam Clay, conceive of the comic book ""The Escapist"" the novel takes on a new urgency and speed and interest in the lives of the characters kicks into high gear. The book's plot twists and turns are seamless and flow in an epic arc that takes this larger than life story and makes it very personal. I was surprised to find this lengthy novel to be a page turner, but it is. There are many interesting threads and subplots and I was curious to see how Mr. Chabon pulled them all together.Although Chabon's vocabulary can irritate me, I have to give him praise for some of the most apt, yet unusual and unique, similes that I have come across in recent reads. Some of his figurative language is simply astounding!At first read the ending of ""The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay"" is almost a letdown...almost. On further reflection it is quiet and rather forgettable. Which is to say that this novel ends the way that most life stories end, without much fanfare at all.The latest edition of this text also includes an ""Odds and Ends"" section in which Chabon has written a new Afterward for the novel and included some material he cut from the original text, and/ or wrote after it was published. A kind of bonus material section of the book if you will. It is actually interesting and compliments the text quite nicely. Chabon teases the reader that thoughts of a sequel to ""The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay"" enter his mind occasionally.

This collection of essays, interspersed with the occasional fictional character monologue, is the type of book that is in Mr. Sedaris' wheelhouse.There are many fine moments in this text, and to highlight just a few...in the essay ""Attaboy"" Sedaris delivers a prescient and funny warning about what is wrong with modern parenting, and the desire to be your kid's friend. In the essay ""Memory Laps"" Sedaris does what he does best, which is capture a profound thought / idea in the midst of a humorous essay. It turns on a dime and the last paragraph of this piece is highly effective and moving. In ""If I Ruled the World"" (one of the fictional monologues in the text) Sedaris goes for the quick and easy laughs, but it is funny. There are people who think and talk like this, and there are moments where the satire stings.One thing I did not like about Sedaris' book ""Squirrel Seeks Chipmunk"" was that I thought it was extremely mean spirited. In an interesting breakdown in this text I found the nonfiction pieces to be rather even handed and fair-minded. However, his short fictional monologues often contain callous and cheap stereotypes, and more than a few are overtly political. Especially bad is the monologue ""Health-care Freedoms and Why I Want My Country Back"", which is nothing but an attack on conservatives. It is not funny, or even clever, and that detracts from the book. I don't begrudge Sedaris, or any writer, their politics but I am tired to death of cheap and mean attacks and Sedaris is as guilty as those he skewers for doing this.The essays in ""Let's Explore Diabetes with Owls"" are almost all good, and the fictional monologues range from awful to hysterical. I am always amazed at Sedaris' ability to abruptly change the tone of an essay. You will be reading along laughing and then the tone abruptly shifts and you are quiet and contemplative. That is a wonderful skill and it is deftly employed in this text. There is a quote on the dust jacket from Nancy Dalva that I think is as good an assessment of Mr. Sedaris' skill as any I have come across. It says ""He'll be telling a weird story, and all of a sudden, just at the end, it turns out to be not only about him, but also you.""

I am not sure how I feel about it, and there is a part of me that wishes I had not seen the film. The reason is simple really. I think ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"" might be one of those rare examples where the film is better than the source book material. I won't say that definitively, but I think it is possible. That is not to say that the novel is bad, it isn't at all. It is just not as tight as the film was and I think the book would have been helped by a narrower focus.""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"" is written in a very unique style and is a quick read. The wonderful opening paragraph lets you know right away that this story is not traditional and that you are in for a different reading experience. The main protagonist of the story is a young boy, Oskar Schell, who lost his father in the World Trade Center on 9/11. He finds a key in his father's belongings and sets out on a quest to find the lock that it opens. The parts of the novel that are narrated by Oskar and follow his quest are the best parts of the text, and fulfilled my expectations. However, the parts of the book narrated by Oskar's grandparents dragged for me. This subplot detracts from the main storyline and also feels too contrived. The novel tackles the tragedy of 9/11 while also incorporating the bombing of Dresden in WW II, and it feels like a little much. If I remember correctly the film does not incorporate the Dresden subplot, and this created the tighter focus that I mentioned earlier. I wish the novel had done the same.Another hang up for me was the annoying stylistic choice of writing dialogue without clarifying who was speaking. You get use to it; I just did not like the choice because I do not see how it enhanced the text.""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"" just left me unsatisfied. I think because there are too many unresolved threads and you never get a feeling of catharsis for anyone's storyline, and a reader needs that. The story focuses at points on Oskar, his mother, and both of his paternal grandparents and in none of those plotlines is there any sort of resolution.Although I am left unsatisfied, I did like the book. It is a very different reading experience and I won't dismiss the text because I need to mull over it some more. Regardless, Jonathan Safran Foer is clearly a talented and imaginative writer and this novel has elicited varying reactions from many readers. I have friends who adore it and some who loathe it.

David McCullough is a proven great writer and historian, and this biography does not get bogged down in the minutia that plagues some biographies. This is the third text of McCullough's that I have read, and none have disappointed. McCullough is wonderful at giving details that vividly set the scene or locale, and the interesting tidbits and facts that he weaves within the greater narrative of John Adams' life flesh out and humanize these larger than life people and times.John Adams was a well traveled man, which I did not know, and 18th century France, Philadelphia, and Holland are evocatively created in this text. This is just one of the many strengths of this book, there are many others, some of which I will share now. The accounts of Adams' years as vice president are as concise, and yet richly detailed, political account as I have ever read. This is a part of Adams' life that is usually dismissed in his biography but it radiates with historical importance in this text. Another strong section of this biography is chapter 11 which deals with Adams' post political life. It focuses on his voluminous correspondence and cements the reader's appreciation for this remarkable American. Adams wrote and said a lot of profound and prophetic things in this period of his life, and McCullough shares many of those thoughts with us.Another strong facet of this biography is in how well McCullough shows us the humanity of these iconic people. Washington, Adams, Jefferson were good and ill mixed together and I have a clearer and more accurate picture of these three men then I ever got in my schooling. An interesting side note is that if there is a ""villain"" in this piece it is Alexander Hamilton. He really was not that great a human being, and it is a shame that history has been kinder to him than to Adams, who was far more deserving.After reading ""John Adams"" I also realize that anyone who bemoans the state of modern politics does not know their political history. This text vividly brings to life the rancor and malice that permeated these early American presidential elections. One marvels at the strength of our republic that it is able to withstand the onslaught every four years of these elections.There really is not a weak section in this book, and it ends on a very strong note. When Adams dies you feel the pang of his loss, and of the loss of the type of people who comprised his American generation. ""John Adams"" is a well written and immersive experience.

Thus the 2 star rating I gave it for the purposes of this . I have seen first-hand how teenagers eat this book up and I find their reaction appropriate to their intellectual and maturity levels. What I don't get are all the adults fawning over this text. My  is aimed at those readers.As someone who works every day with teenagers I could not get over the massively unrealistic speech / dialogue of the kids that this novel portrays. The brightest kids I know don't talk the way these characters do, and in this book ALL the kids talk like Aaron Sorkin writes their dialogue. As a result I kept being pulled out of the story by this distraction. Coming from the mouths of kids it is just obnoxious.The most ridiculous aspect of this book is the subplot that involves the protagonist's favorite writer, Peter Van Houten. It horribly detracts from the main plot of the text, and needed to be cut from the novel entirely. To make matters worse, some of the worst written parts of this novel deal with that subplot. Some examples include an insipid and unrealistic trip to Amsterdam that is just for lack of a better word, stupid. It involves a scene where the protagonist and her boyfriend kiss in the Anne Frank museum and onlookers clap while they kiss. No joke! It feels like a parody of bad writing. It is not helped by the fact that the character of Peter Van Houten has the most pretentious and fake sounding speech that I have come across in a book. His character wrote a novel that is the favorite of the protagonists' called ""An Imperial Affliction"" and the characters in this text quote from, and reference, it often. If the book actually existed it would be one of the more pretentious and unreadable things on the planet.Now as to why I think teenagers love this book. First, it is a very quick read. You do keep turning the pages. The topic of the text (teenagers with cancer) is an engaging idea full of dramatic possibilities. The last 80 pages or so of the book have some decent moments. Alas, they are too often followed by scenes of such sap that they quickly descend into cliché and the worse kind of sentimentality.As I said earlier, the novel's topic is a good one, and I am disappointed that Mr. Green insisted on making what could have been an interesting story into the worst kind of melodrama....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,not set,"Feb 17, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11870085-the-fault-in-our-stars

Rather those are the devices that playwright Yasmina Reza uses to develop her themes in this text. ""Art"" is a work about the subjective nature of human relationships, friendship in particular.This three character play is a quick read, and a work that I think needs to be revisited a few times before one can really sink their teeth into it. The power of this play is to be found in the myriad of ways that we recognize ourselves and some of our relationships in its characters. When one looks at long friendships we see that there are so many implied understandings that those relationships consist of, and most strain in long term relationships happens when one, or more, of those standings are violated. In the case of this play fault lines in the friendship between Marc and Serge (the combatants of the play's main conflict) are made larger when Serge buys a painting that destroys the idea of him that Marc has projected as his image of Serge for so long. What long term friendship has not been destroyed, or ultimately strengthened, by such an encounter?The text has some wonderfully funny moments, especially in the character of Yvan who is a little neurotic and overwhelmed by the intellectual capacities of Serge and Marc. I also think Yvan is the character that we come to understand the most, although he seems secondary to the other two.I would see the play professionally done, and then read it a month or so later. I think one can get a lot out of the experience in approaching it in this way. ""Art"" has a lot to give, but it does not give it up easily. It is not difficult to ""miss the forest for the trees"" with this text.The play asks us if we are authentic people, or just the projections our friends want us to be.

At times the satire is biting, and dead on. There are also some fun allusions scattered throughout the text that are gamefully deployed and fun to catch. Also fun are some of the thinly veiled caricatures of recognizable people. Arianna Huffington, Frank Rich, and the Huffington Post are clearly lampooned, as our other elements of our political pop culture. ""Banquo's Ghosts"" is even decently written, at times, and it always moves quickly.But...there is also plenty to disappoint in this text. The majority of the characterizations are flat and stereotypical, and although the writing is okay it is too often painfully clunky and heavy handed. As for the ending, it is just dull. This is a book for the beach or a rainy afternoon. Nothing more.For me the biggest joy of this text was its unfettered and open disgust with terrorists, and honestly stating that Islamic extremism is one of the most violent ideologies on the planet. I also enjoyed (and yes I know it was simple and not fleshed out) its celebration of America and those who keep us safe.So, I guess I am saying I would probably read another book by these authors (in the above conditions) but I also suspect that the majority of the joy one can derive from this text is to be had on the first reading....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Feb 17, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5838878-banquo-s-ghosts

The book is told from the point of view of the protagonist of the title, and there is too much disparity between Billy's inner voice and his actual dialogue. They don't even remotely resemble the same person, and this was too great a leap for me to take. In fact, I feel like the narrative voice of the book was the author, Ben Fountain, inserting himself and it comes across as pretentious and smarmy. ""Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk"" is (like its cumbersome title) overwrought.The text took me over 100 pages to really get into any sort of reading rhythm, as it just did not engage me before then. I will say this, the last 100 or so pages read much quicker, but by that point in my reading I had just accepted that the book was going to be what it was. Prior to that point I kept hoping it would get better.A big objection I have with the text is how insulting it is to Texas and Texans in general. It continually satirizes them, and to read this novel you would think the entire state is filled with shallow idiots who (gasp) love their country. One gets the feeling that Mr. Fountain (who lives in Dallas) thinks he is the smartest guy in the state. I am not the only person in my book group to get this impression, and I think it detracts from the story a great deal.An interesting note, I wonder if I would have enjoyed the text more had I not read the numerous s that overpriase this text to a ridiculous degree. It is not, despite what some have said, ""This generations `Slaughterhouse Five' or `Catch 22'"". Not even close, not even in the same stadium.Some praises I have for the book include the character of Shroom (who is dead when the novel begins). He is a member of the Bravo squad that was killed in Iraq and he looms large over the text. I loved him, as does the novel's protagonist and I wanted to know more about him. Another section I enjoyed was on pages 214-215 when a character delivers a monologue on the virtues of capitalism. I suspect Fountain meant it as satire, but it is actually a profound and honest defense of that economic system.The final paragraph of the book is good, but overall ""Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk"" is pretentious as can be. It contains some of the most verbose and overstuffed writing I have comes across in years, and it does nothing for the text.

His first novel ""The Liar"" is an interesting, erudite, comic, and witty semi thriller all in one package. The protagonist of this novel, one Adrian Healey, is always lying to and fooling others. In no great irony the person he is lying to the most is himself. Almost every reader will see some of their own foibles in him at some point in the text, which can make for some uncomfortable reading moments. Adrian is both nasty and kind, and I vacillated between liking and hating him throughout most of the novel.As for the style in which the book is written I have a qualm. The first part of the novel jumps around a lot in time without stating in any discernable way that a time shift has occurred. It confused me at moments. It is a stylistic choice, but it is one that I did not prefer. ""The Liar"" is also a very ""English"" book. Many phrases, colloquialisms and customs are quite foreign to the American reader. This is not a complaint by the way, but there were moments where I knew I did not understand something, but these differences were not enough for me to lose major plot points. The only time it annoyed me was when the text focused on the game of cricket. That happens frequently in the story and I was at a total loss in those moments.Some strengths of the text are the wonderful use of allusions. There are allusions galore in this novel, probably more than I have ever encountered in one text. They span the spectrum from the Bible and other ancient texts, to the latest (at the time of the book's setting) pop culture events. I was very impressed at the scope and depth of Mr. Fry's obvious knowledge. A major enjoyment of this novel was trying to catch the plethora of allusions and seeing how wittily they were employed in the character's mouths. Pages 110-119 of the book also present some of the most perceptive writing that I have come across about what ""love"" is to most people. Love for most of us is just some form of being needed, and when Fry writes, ""The only thought that will give me the energy to carry on is that someone has a life which will be diminished by my departure from it"" you find yourself vigorous agreeing.""The Liar"" has one weakness and that is the spy / espionage subplot that Fry inserts in brief chapters between the longer chapters that depict the linear narrative of the story. They are set off by italics until the subplot and main plot connect up, and I thought that it was a detraction from the text, weakened it almost like Fry did not trust the characters he had created on their own merits, but rather had to make them interesting by inserting them into a spy thriller novel. It was not necessary in my opinion.""The Liar"" ends cleverly, but not very satisfyingly.

I read the book because of an interest in Shakespeare and the Fist Folio of his work. The ""detective"" aspect of the text was not a big deal to me. If a literary true crime book is what you are looking for, this is not it.What ""The Shakespeare Thefts"" really is is an easily accessible and consumed prologue to what is clearly Mr. Rasmussen's passion, the cataloging of every detail of every extant First Folio. Rasmussen's constant references to this project get old after a while. This catalogue was published but it is purely for historical and academic record and not something that the general public would be interested in consuming. That is what ""The Shakespeare Thefts"" seems to have been for. This is fine, but again, know what you are buying before picking it up.The text is arranged in very short chapters, each a free standing anecdote in its own right, and together they form a loosely connected survey of some of the more colorful moments in the history of the First Folio. I think a much more interesting book that achieves the same results with a better effect is ""The Book of William"" by Paul Collins.

I finally read it, and I understand now why I was told repeatedly to do so. The book is written in a manner that is literary, yet also mimics the cadence and style of the oral tradition method of storytelling that would have been native to the Ibo people of Nigeria of whom the novel is about. It takes the reader a while to get use to the Ibo names, terms, and colloquialisms and for that reason a short glossary of Ibo terms is included in the back of the text. It is useful, however you can figure out what most of the Ibo words mean from context.The protagonist of ""Things Fall Apart"" is Okonkwo, a dislikable, insecure, mean man. He comes across to the surface reader as the archetypal ignorant male head of the house. That is a lazy read, as Chinua Achebe has written a novel that goes deep below the surface, and although the novel and many of the customs are very dated and specific to the Ibo people of the 1890s, the problems that plague the characters (but not many of the circumstances) are universal and always will be. Don't read this novel with the goal of feeling culturally superior. Read it and accept it on its own terms and you will get so much more out of it.There are many characters in the text, and it is to Mr. Achebe's credit that they all come across as very real, and his ability to give a good characterization in just a few sentences is astounding at times. One of my favorite characters is Uchendu, the uncle of Okonkwo. Although he does not appear until halfway through the novel and does not speak much, when he does speak pay attention. Some of the novel's best moments are his and much of the thematic wisdom of the text comes from his mouth.This novel is a surprisingly quick read, you are sucked in quite seductively and don't realize it until it is too late. I hesitate to say what ""Things Fall Apart"" is about, but I will say that I think the novel does deal with a man who is uncomfortable in the time in which he lives. Okonkwo is a man who should have been born 100 year earlier. He is a strong man, in the traditional sense, but weak in the ways that matter. He is a man living down his father (who isn't) and an insecure individual who masks his fears by abuse and anger. The novel's ending is a chilling warning about where that path leads.I regret that I have not read this wonderful novel sooner.

As someone who loves reading about the Civil War period in American history I was familiar with the generalized versions of John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry Virginia in 1859, but Mr. Horwitz's engaging and well researched account give that incident a much wider significance for the modern reader.This text offers an excellent accounting of the political atmosphere in America prior to 1859, especially in how it relates to the question of slavery. Horwitz displays a talent for making what could be a dry history tale into the most relevant political lessons. He also does a lively and detailed job showing how John Brown lived and developed as a rabid abolitionist as destiny propelled him to his fate at Harper's Ferry. Most of the information included in this part of the book I knew nothing, or very little, about.The book is also strengthened by the inclusion of numerous photographs and illustrations that enhance the text, and put faces to the many names and characters that people the story. Most of them, with a few exceptions, have been lost to general history and are unfamiliar to us. Mr. Horwtiz makes them real, and more importantly, relevant!Tony Horwitz is best known for writing books that combine history with modern travelogues, and interweaving the tales together. It is a formula that he utilizes quite well, however ""Midnight Rising"" does not follow that pattern, and many readers seemed disappointed by this shift in Horwitz's focus. I am not among them. This book is a work of popular history, much like the books of Erik Larson, and I hope Mr. Horwitz continues writing in this tradition, as he is quite skilled at it.The book flags a little after the execution of Brown and some of his men, and gets a little redundant. Almost as if the author did not know how to conclude the text. It is still interesting; it just drops in quality from the first ¾ of the text. However, the book ends on a strong note with a poem by Langston Hughes, who in a remarkable coincidence was linked to one of Brown's raiders.Whether John Brown was insane, a domestic terrorist, or a firebrand and avenging angel is left to the reader to decide. Horwtiz stays remarkably neutral in the text (which is a good thing) and the book does a wonderful job showing how full circle the net of history is when Horwitz details how many events that converged in Harper's Ferry in 1859 came back around to that place, or some of its people, in the decades following.

This slim book is written as the unnamed protagonist's notes for a possible future novel. ""Ablutions"" does not utilize first person, but instead is written in second person with the narrator always using the pronoun ""you"" in his notes to himself. This creates a very effective sense of distance in the text that aids the book greatly. The novel is broken up into four parts and further scaled down into short vignettes about the narrator's life, or the patrons who frequent the Hollywood bar at which he has worked for over a decade. Most of the vignettes start with the phrase ""Discuss..."" as if they are notes that the narrator has scribbled down to remind him of ideas.As already mentioned, the novel is written in four parts and part two of this text is depressing and dreary as our narrator spins out of control. deWitt does an excellent job of showing us the narrator's decline without ever once stating that this is what is happening. It is a joy to be trusted by an author like that. For him to expect you to be involved with the text and see what is happening for yourself.In one glaring misstep deWitt shifts the locale of the book in part three from the Hollywood bar and sends the protagonist on a ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" type road trip. Personally I thought it was a little ridiculous and the book lost some of its edge at this point. The Hunter S. Thompson vibe just does not work for this novel.

I imagine they would not appreciate what Vonnegut is doing here. The book is subtitled an ""autobiographical collage"", and that is an apt description. It is nonfiction, with the exception of two short humorous creative pieces that Vonnegut throws in. It has hints at the bitterness that would come to swallow up Vonnegut's' later works, but it had not consumed him yet when he wrote ""Palm Sunday"".One of the most interesting aspects of the text is when Vonnegut lies about himself. For instance, he states that there were no other women involved in the breakup of his first marriage, and this is patently untrue. I love that aspect of this book, seeing how Vonnegut selects bits of autobiography to make himself look good. It makes him seem so human. He probably needed to believe a lot of good things about himself during the time he wrote this. His last novel had been roundly trashed by critics, and a lot of personal family junk had broken apart all over his head. I think most of us would have cleaned up our past a little if we could have, and Vonnegut's humanity is what has always drawn me to him and his writing.Any avid reader will enjoy the opening chapter of ""Palm Sunday"" which deals with the first amendment and censorship. Vonnegut is at his biting and indignant best in this chapter. Chapter four of the text also includes a lovely essay on literary style. It is a profound and simple statement on what makes the best writing, which does not have to be ""literature"", but just the stuff we scribble in our everyday lives. It is the act of communicating with each other that powers the soul and Vonnegut is eloquent in his defense of it.Another highlight of the book is a speech that Vonnegut gave called ""The Noodle Factory"". It is on pages 144-150 of the text and it is about reading, imagination, and the divine gifts they give. It is excellent writing, and is appropriate reading for the ages. Mankind should constantly be reminded of the ideas Vonnegut brings up so eloquently in this speech.Some of the essays in this book are a little dated, it was published in 1981. However, the themes of human dignity and loneliness (Vonnegut staples) are brought up in essays and speeches all throughout the text, and those subjects are timeless.The title ""Palm Sunday"" came from a sermon Vonnegut delivered at a church on Palm Sunday. It is an interesting piece to read from a self professed ""Christ worshiping agnostic"" and is the last chapter of the text. In the sermon he hits up his plea for human mercy and dignity and it is a nice way to end the book....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Feb 16, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9602.Palm_Sunday

The subject matter of her previous book, ""The River of Doubt"" does not sound all that interesting to me, but in her capable hands I am sure I will enjoy it. What a testament to her skills as a writer and historian.I knew the basics about President James Garfield, and a little about his assassin, however, Millard's in-depth characterization of Garfield makes me sad for two reasons. One, it seems apparent that America missed out on a possible great presidency due to one's man's mental illness, and second, where are the leaders like James Garfield today?An especially effective device in the text was starting each chapter with a quote from something Garfield said or wrote. It gives you hints at what a great man he must have been. When you read a book whose ending you know, and still have an emotional response to it then you know the author has done something extraordinary. That was certainly the case with ""Destiny of the Republic"".The real magic of this text is how seamlessly Millard weaves the tale of President Garfield with the events of the times, the mental illness of his eventual assassin (Charles Guiteau) the genius of Alexander Graham Bell, and the arrogance of the medical establishment, especially in her depiction of the physician chiefly responsible for Garfield's medical care after he was shot, Dr. D. Willard Bliss. If history has a villain for Garfield's death, his assassin is followed closely by the medical team that cared for Garfield, and their supreme ignorance and arrogance.""Destiny of the Republic"" is important history that is very well rendered.

The attempt to bring in a real person comes across as contrived and cheap, especially in the context in which it is used in this novel, and when it first happens in the text I could not entirely believe Bazell would go there.""Wild Thing"" just suffers from lazy writing from that point on. The ""villain"" of the piece is obvious (almost from the get go) the book dredges up more politically correct white man's guilt than any person can stand to read, and plotting just goes out the window.

First off there is an Appendix (by one of the novel's characters) that is nothing but a liberal screed against the Republican Party.

There are some nice strengths to this text, and there are some great weaknesses. There are too may dull and/ or redundant sections in the text for it to rate as one of the best books on Shakespeare. There are much more engaging and interesting biographies of the Bard out there than this one.One strength of the text is that, unlike many Shakespeare biographies, Ackroyd goes into great depth about Shakespeare's ancestors and his early life in Stratford, more than any other writer I have yet encountered. It is interesting and well done, and he makes some compelling arguments about how Shakespeare's childhood shaped the man he became.Another very good section of the book is chapter 45, where Ackroyd spends a bit of time insightfully discussing Shakespearian characterization. This might not be interesting for readers who don't like analyzing characters, but I do, and found it intriguing and thoughtful.A huge annoyance for me is Ackroyd's insistence on using the original Elizabethan spellings and grammar when quoting from primary sources of the period, including Shakespeare's plays. This adds unneeded confusion and difficulty to the text, and serves no purpose other than to create hindrances for the reader. Making the words more difficult to decipher does not change their meaning, it just gives the reader a reason to put the book down. Why would a writer do that?This text is also highly speculative, as any book on Shakespeare's life must be, but Ackroyd goes to great lengths to say that this or that idea is not worth speculating about... and then he does just that. Speculate away sir, give us reasons for your insights and thoughts and lets us decide for ourselves. But don't pretend that you are not doing it. It is a cloying device and detracts from the work. In an idea that he surely lifted from Harold Bloom, Mr. Ackroyd writes, ""It could be said that Shakespeare was present at the invention of human motive and human purpose in English history."" One only need read Shakespeare to see how accurate a statement this is, and in this text's better moments it shows how Shakespeare did just that in his life's writings....more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,not set,not set,"Feb 16, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/32483.Shakespeare

I have stayed away from the novel before now because its authors are Historians and not writers and badly written books annoy me greatly. ""To Try Men's Souls"" is nicely written at times and just full of awful prose at others.Some strengths of the text include the very clever manner Tom Paine gets the ideas and inspiration for his famous ""The American Crisis"" pamphlet. It is historical that Paine traveled with the army for a while, and that serves as the jumping off point for the authors to use a neat narrative device here. I won't spoil it for you.The crossing of the Delaware River is a harrowing moment in the text. The authors do an excellent job in creating atmosphere and in detailing how key an element the weather was in that first year of the Revolution. It is something readers might not readily think about, and I was grateful for the authors' ardent attention to it.Although the action of the Battle of Trenton took place on December 25 & 26 1776, and the novel takes place in real time on those dates, the characters flashback to events from the previous year as current events jog their memories. This device works, and as a result the reader gets a lot of information about the miraculous year of 1776 and a sense of the awe inspiring hand of Providence in our history during that year.Despite the highlights of this book, there are several things that detract mightily from it. A huge deficit is the dialogue of the characters which at times comes across as the authors pontificating through the characters. This is especially notable in the character of George Washington. Another (humorous) annoyance was the great lengths the writers go to to make sure that the readers never doubt for a moment that when two male characters express ""love"" for each other that it is entirely platonic. It is obvious and stupid and repeated often. After a while it starts to come across like the characters are ""protesting too much"".Some ers liked the device of the fictional Van Dorn family of Trenton and their divided loyalties in the war. I suppose the authors created these characters to give them some leeway in presenting some commentary on the events. I don't know. But this fictionalized tale of a family with divided loyalties being reunited during the battle is a little weak and gets tedious. It detracts from the text and helps veer the novel into the melodrama that seems to be its prevalent style after the Battle of Trenton is fought. The badly written subplot of the Van Dorn family combined with Washington walking around speaking like a didactic historian detracts from the book. Before this point in the novel I would say the text was a 4 star book, after the Battle of Trenton it never recovers and veers into 3 star melodrama.However, a great decision was made when the writers decided to put Thomas Paine's ""American Crisis # 1"" at the end of the novel. It makes for stirring reading, especially after the context that the novel gives you.I understand there are three books in this series, and I will probably give the next one a chance.

I read it quickly, although I found the book to be ""slow"", and after it was done it stuck with me for quite some time. That seems to be the motif for my reading of Wilder's novels.And I love them!I am a little disappointed at how many ers want to call this book a satire, despite the fact that Mr. Wilder went to great lengths to point out that the novel is not a satire at all. The story follows a fundamentalist traveling salesman named George Brush whose philosophies and non malicious ignorance get him in one sad situation after another. George Brush is a good man, although I was often very irritated at his simplemindedness and frustrated at his sometimes idiotic views about certain religious topics. However that is exactly the response Wilder wanted to elicit in the reader. George Brush is only 23 in the book, and recently converted to Christianity, and he has all of the joy and stupidity of a recent convert. Wilder said about his novel's protagonist that he ""is everybody when they are young"", and the novel's ending is a perfect climax for the next stage of Brush's life and one that Wilder lets the reader decide for themselves.At its heart ""Heaven's My Destination"" is about a man who sees the world as a very ugly place, and is bound and determined to try to make the parts of it that he comes into contact with better. He is idealistic, naïve, and maybe even deluded...but so what? He hurts no one and is striving to make the world better in some way.George Brush is really the only fleshed out character in the novel, although each chapter is peopled with many cameo characters that appear and then are gone. It is to Wilder's great credit as a writer that they come across, for the most part, as very real.I hesitate to offer a lot of commentary on a book that is so ambiguous and open to interpretation so I will end with what Thornton Wilder himself said about this novel's protagonist, ""George Brush at his best is everybody.""

This genre busting novel is a well paced and plotted story, wonderfully and skillfully written, and easily can be considered good literature to boot.The book is essentially a road trip which is also a treatise on the nature of worship and the role that gods play in our lives. It is also an examination of the pluralistic society of America, and as already mentioned it is an intriguing and quickly moving tale. I would encourage reading it with a book club or a few friends because I think the novel has many layers that a variety of readers would best be equipped to discuss and explore. As a result, reading this enjoyable text would be rendered into an even greater reading experience.One of the many joys of the text is noticing, and trying to catch the vast amount of mythological references that Mr. Gaiman has saturated the book with. His knowledge and reading in this area must be extensive, as the references are vast and deep in the text. It is a great pleasure when you recognize the clever, and usually subtle, manner in which these references are integrated into the storyline. The large number of them only serves to highlight one of the text's themes, the sheer amount and vastness of belief and the huge role it has played in human history.Although I tore through the book at a rapid pace, I will admit that in this 588 page text I was slightly bored and annoyed from pages 543 to 583. Essentially, Chapter 19 to the beginning of the Postscript is the weakest and most contrived part of the text. After building to a climactic battle that brings the book's themes into sharp focus, this falling action of ""American Gods"" was a little underwhelming. However, the novel's postscript redeems it, and frankly even if it didn't I could not complain all that much considering the brilliance that preceded Chapter 19.A real delight was the novel's protagonist, an ex con named Shadow whose sardonic and very dry humor was a highlight of the text for me. His identity is also a mystery, and one is left with many plausible possibilities for who Shadow may really be.This was my first experience with a Neil Gaiman novel, but it has left me with a taste in my mouth for more. ""American Gods"" was a thoroughly original and enjoyable reading experience, and one of the best novels I have read in the last year. I will read it again someday, and I know I will find even more in the text than I did on the first reading.

I disagree whI recently read ""The Hobbit"" for only the second time in my life, and I have to argue with the people who say this is a children's book. I disagree wholeheartedly. Although there are elements of children's fantasy tales in the text, the themes and actions of ""The Hobbit"" are much more oriented to adults.I won't waste time rehashing plot points with this iconic text; instead I will focus on some features that stuck out to me.First off, if one is familiar with the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, I think their reading of ""The Hobbit"" will yield some interesting insights and they will catch some details that people not familiar with LOTR would miss. One can read, and greatly enjoy, ""The Hobbit"" as a standalone text, but I think it is much better when considered within the framework of LOTR.Another observation that surprised me was just how unlikeable the dwarves are in this book. Tolkien frequently mentions in his other works that dwarves are foolish and selfish, and usually only do good works when prompted by circumstance, but on this reading of ""The Hobbit"" they greatly annoyed me. Perhaps because of how much they remind me of most of humanity. And maybe that was Tolkien's intent? An allegory for how humanity often only makes the right choice when goaded into it, as opposed to it being our first and natural instinct.Although there are moments in the text that are a little slow going, they are few and far between, and Tolkien focuses much less on the minutia of detail about Middle Earth in this book as opposed to some of his others. I had also forgotten how action packed the last 100 pages or so of ""The Hobbit"" are. I was recently arguing with a friend that the decision to make the films of ""The Hobbit"" a trilogy was just greed as the book could not support 3 films. I was wrong, if the movies are well done, there is more than enough in this text to justify three films.This rereading of ""The Hobbit"" has made me want to jump back into Middle Earth, and I sense that I will be picking up and rereading more of Tolkien in the very near future.

I believe its greatest flaws are the result of the writer's age. I also think its greatest strengths are the result of the writer's age. This text is for the most part an unbiased and interesting take on one aspect of evangelical Christianity (which is a vast and very diverse subculture) and gives an outsider's undercover inside view. I enjoyed the text a lot, but I wonder if I got more out of it because I understand the evangelical culture, being raised in church, more than readers who have no Christian upbringing? I am not sure.In short, Mr. Roose decides that he has no understanding of fundamentalist Christianity as a result of his uber liberal upbringing, and rather than be one of the intolerant ""tolerant"" liberal elite decides to find out for himself the truth behind what he has assumed or been told. The result is a semester being a student at Liberty University in Virginia, the college started by the late Dr. Jerry Falwell.There are moments in ""The Unlikely Disciple"" that are quite profound and theologically interesting, and Roose seems to be very honest about the power of Christian living and the attraction that it holds. However, the text also suffers from some rather insipid and pedantic observations made by Roose that I believe are expressly the result of his age. There are parts of the text that reek of the ""philosophical"" discussions we all had while sitting around with our friends drunk in the dorms thinking that we were being ""deep."" They detract from the text because they are so jarring and contradict (in terms of quality) the better parts of the book.The text also slides between embracing and detracting from the faith and belief of the Liberty community. Roose often contradicts himself, usually on the same page. This may prove frustrating to some readers, but I did not mind it (for the most part) simply because the gamut of thought and emotion seems to be part of religious faith for many people. One thing I found particularly interesting was that the most unlikable (and I believe) bigoted people mentioned in the text are polar opposites. Roose has a homophobic and mean spirited roommate who I find disgusting. He also mentions frequently two lesbian aunts, who I found to be just as bigoted and small minded about people not like them. I don't think this was a purposeful contrast that the author tried to create, but it is there, and I have talked to others who read this book that thought the same thing.All in all an interesting text and one that I am glad I read.

I have not read or seen it since, but recently returned to it. 16 years after my first encounter with this piece I still am moved by it, but for very different reasons. I guess that is what makes it a classic.The protagonist of the play, the iconic Willy Loman, is a frustrating, loser of a man who frankly has been a cruel fool his entire life. He is jealous of people who succeed, even when their success is because of their own merits, he is an adulterer, and he is a dad who wants to be his son's buddy, not his father. In short, he is everything I dislike. I don't feel sympathy for Willy Loman, and when he died I breathed a sigh of relief for his family who has been relieved of the burden of dealing with him. With the exception of his ever faithful wife, Linda, Willy's sons have already relieved themselves of him (to varying degrees). So the ""hero"" of the play is not noble, and does not meet Aristotle's definition of a tragic hero. So what is the tragedy? Why is the play so important? I think there are two primary reasons.The first is the relationship between Willy and his sons, especially Biff. Biff and his father love each other very much; they just don't love each other very well. I think there are a lot of fathers and sons who can relate to that dynamic. It made me cringe more than a few times with its poignancy, and accuracy. And watching Biff's frustration with trying to communicate honestly with his father (the fault belonging to them both) was the reason for my weeping all those years ago.The other reason the play is tragic is because although Willy is a nobody (and I think it is his own doing) he was loved by some people who cared deeply about him. Despite a wonderful wife, some loyal friends that he does not deserve, etc. Willy is always looking for greener grass and never content with what is in front of him. To have some truly good things, primarily family love and friendship, and to spit in its face for decades is the tragedy. Willy was a somebody to them, but it was not enough for him. The tragedy of this piece stems from Willy's ignorance, and also is extended for those who loved him.There is a lot that can be said about this play, and I don't pretend to be the final word. These are just some thoughts. Read it for yourself; let some of the lovely prose sweep over you. Pay attention to some of Linda's speeches as even out of context they are wonderful.

On page 9 Burroughs writes, ""The truth is humbling, terrifying, and often exhilarating. It blows the doors off the hinges and fills the world with fresh air."" I find this statement profound, and there are moments in this text where the book succeeds at doing just that.First off, I would not recommend reading this book straight through like one would a novel. I would read it a chapter at a time, taking a couple of days break in between. I recommend this because there are so many complex issues addressed in the book that to read it as one unit is to detract from some of the parts that deserve your attention and thought after you have read them. I was not enjoying the text until I broke my reading of it up into bits and pieces.A problem I have with ""This is How""' is that there are parts of the book that are too targeted to a specific subgroup to be all that interesting to the general reader. The chapter he writes on being skinny, with a heavy focus on anorexia, leaps to mind. Only if you have lived through this disease would you be even mildly interested in what he writes there. Other detractions in the text are the hackneyed moments where he creates imagined dialogues to illustrate whatever point he is making. They are mostly not good, and especially terrible is his imagined rant from an old racist. It reeks of bad television writing.The worst chapter of the book is his chapter on abuse. It is didactic, too broad in its assumptions, and just very self serving. I would skip it.However, I think the book has much more helpful parts than bad. The chapter entitled ""How to live unhappily ever after"" is by far the best chapter in the book (pages 167-170). Mr. Burroughs argument for being simply ""content"" with your life is profound! Also very good is the chapter ""How to feel sorry for yourself"" (pages 56-59). It is a complex idea very simply and succinctly stated.Some ers have said that Burroughs is too harsh. He is harsh at times, but I disagree that this is a bad thing. The chapter on ""dreams"" (of the follow your dreams, etc. variety) is harsh and very honest. It is as honest an assessment I have ever read of this esoteric concept. In the same vein, when he writes about how to ""get over"" the past he is saying some powerful things that many readers may resent, but he is right.I would recommend this text, and leave this  with some additional thoughts. The ideas on regret in this book come from the author's personal experience and spoke to me even though I don't share similarities with his situation. I think they will speak to a lot of readers.

In one of his shorter novels BHaving read most of Christopher Buckley's novels, I can attest to ""No Way to Treat a First Lady"" being one of his best. In one of his shorter novels Buckley ironically delivers some of the best characterization of his career and also avoids one of (what I consider to be) his most salient weaknesses, a terrible ending. I enjoy Buckley's novels for their humor, satire, and his prose style which is wonderful, with just enough educated diction to keep the mind pleased while delivering some off color humor in a manner that almost seems sophisticated, although it isn't and that is the point.I won't get into much plot detail other than to say that the premise of the book is that the first lady is charged with killing her husband, the president. What ensues is some of Buckley's best satire and some of his funniest writing. I tore through this text mainly because it follows a trial and at times reads like a legal thriller, just one that is better written than most. The book also is peopled with a plethora of minor characters who don't come across so much as caricatures, but actual people, and this nice characterization allows the reader to more fully fall into, and enjoy, the world that has been created in the novel.There is also pleasure to be had in recognizing thinly veiled parodies of real people among the book's characters. At times the parodies are quite savage, and I think well deserved. The reader gets to experience a little schadenfreude, and it enhances the book's guilty pleasures. Although frankly Mr. Buckley is too good a writer to be considered a guilty pleasure.""No Way to Treat a First Lady"" is a fun, plot driven sidewinder of a novel, and will yield you much entertainment. It is the perfect text to get through a cold winter weekend or a boiling summer sizzler.

The story is told linearly, the chapters are much longer, etc. However, the unmistakable Vonnegut themes are very much present, and make their first appearances here. ""Player Piano"" deals with the ideas of the danger / dehumanizing effects of technology and how that interacts with basic human dignity. Writing in 1952 about the ""false gods"" of technology, one need only look around today to think that Vonnegut was a prophet foretelling our doom.Frankly, I have a hard time nailing down ""Player Piano"" because I think it meant something different in its original context than perhaps it does now. There are times when the novel seems very anti-communist and anti strong centralized government. The line is even uttered by a government official ""Are you against us?"" implying that the State knows what is best for all. Clearly Vonnegut does not think that is the case. There is also a very intriguing character, the Reverend Lasher. Of particular interest to me was a scene in a saloon where the Reverend gives a lovely speech on the dangers of class warfare. Moments such as this seem tailor made for the early 1950s and what was happening at the time. They come across as a defense of capitalism and American values. If one has read Vonnegut's biography they know that despite the image many people have of him, these were issues that he cared about deeply.I don't want to give away plot points, but the text left me with the distinct impression that Vonnegut had a negative opinion of the impetus and results of most revolutions. The novel is full of contradictions, showing the good and bad aspects of capitalism, communism, messianic leaders, uprisings / revolutions, technology, the advances of science, etc. I don't see where the novel comes down decidedly in one camp or the other. However, one thing the book seems definitive about is in its belief that the general population are nothing more than sheep that easily drift from whim to whim. Like Shakespeare Mr. Vonnegut, in this book at least, seems to have a low opinion of the masses. You only have to pay attention to the ""common man"" during an election season or during the midst of the latest pop culture fad to see that Vonnegut's pessimism is justified.""Player Piano"" is not as brilliant as Vonnegut's later books. It meanders at times and could have been edited into a ""tighter"" novel. However, there are many moments scattered throughout that make it worth your attention. It is thought provoking and timely, despite being 60 years old. It endures, and that alone is reason enough to read it!...more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,not set,not set,"Feb 16, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9597.Player_Piano

I loved it, and then chose ""The Extra Man"" for my book club. Although I think it is a weaker text than some of Ames other novels, it is a very easy and enjoyable read.First off, ""The Extra Man"" is vulgar, gratuitous, and graphic when it comes to sexual thought and exploration. If this is not something you are comfortable with, then don't pick the book up. It is a pervasive part of the text. The novel also offers a very unsanitzed view of NYC prior to the administration of Giuliani, who cleaned up a lot of the seedier elements of Manhattan. When these elements come together in the hands of Mr. Ames they create an engrossing, ambiguous, and interesting tale of sexual confusion and the human need for companionship.The novel has two main characters, the first Louis Ives a twenty something ex teacher who has a myriad of sexual dysfunctions and issues. The other main character, although Louis is our narrator, is an older gentleman of ambiguous sexuality named Henry Harrison. Although I detested his character and the manner in which he lived, Ames has created a personality that leaps off the page and demands your attention. He is one of the most interesting and thought provoking characters I have come across in literature in a long time. These two men are thrown together through a unique plot twist, and the novel follows their lives for the next year or so. The relationship these two share is a mash up of love, need, power, getting comfortable with someone, control, jealousy, lust(?) and all of the other things (many of them gross and embarrassing) that make up the day to day of two people living in close proximity with each other.There is a lot to ""The Extra Man"", more than this space can give it. I hesitate to say anything definitive about it, because Mr. Ames seems to go to such great lengths to not give the reader a definitive answer to anything, other than to make it obvious that humans need each other. The ways that need expresses itself can be, and is as varied as the 7 billion or so of us there are milling about the joint.I am glad this was a book club selection because I will say that my appreciation for the text grew exponentially while discussing it with others. This is worth a read, but if you are new to Ames then I would recommend some of his other work before you ease into this one....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Feb 16, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/96040.The_Extra_Man

This is an okay history play of the Bard’s, and Falstaff is certainly a dominate part of the text, but I am not as in love with Falstaff as many readers are.In the Pelican edition of the play Claire McEachern writes an Introduction that focuses mainly on the character of Prince Hal (who will become Henry V) This, along with some other key insights offered in the Intro will aid your reading of the play.I feel that “Henry IV Part 1” is really the first of 3 plays about Henry V, and Shakespeare creates the character of Falstaff, and the others of the Eastcheap Tavern, to contrast and show off the journey that Prince Hal begins in this play and ends in “Henry IV Part 2”. That is not to detract from those characters at all. I think this play is dominated by Falstaff (who is a great comic creation, and practically oozes humor, charm and practicality with every word he utters) and Hal’s antagonist Hotspur. If Shakespeare ever created a character who could be called dashing, then Hotspur fits the bill. He is a great character, full of fire and verse.Act II:4 of the play is a highlight. Excellent in performance and a nice articulation of the love and loathing that often simultaneously exists in close relationships. The text as a whole is full of lots of balances like this, and it is a motif that works well for the piece.If you are reading “Henry IV Part 1” for the first time I highly recommend reading it right after reading “Richard II” as events follow closely upon the heels of that play.

King Richard is a hopelessly deluded and inept monarch who believes supremely in the divine ordination of kings. He leans on this belief to the exclusion of all of the other king's responsibilities. He makes one poor decision after another, and never reflects on the choice or its consequences before he makes them. However, we still feel a tug at the heart when this monarch is murdered, and this is attributable only to his glorious poetry. Richard speaks in some of Shakespeare's finest verse, and he has the mind for metaphor. I would recommend reading Shakespeare's History plays in order of the king's reign, and one comes to appreciate the complexities and strength of Shakespeare's storytelling. There really are no exceptional characters in this play other than Richard. His antagonist Henry Bolingbroke is a cold hearted dud (and master politician) who plays to the common man and ruthlessly kills those who oppose him. All the while, telling us, and himself, that all his actions are justified and are the results of other's choices. Really he is no different from Richard, except he lacks the King's sense of poetry and theater. There are also some good speeches from secondary characters in this text, especially John of Gaunt. Shakespeare's genius is too large to be contained to only the main characters. ""Richard II"" is a great read, especially for the extraordinary experience of feeling revulsion AND pity for the title character.

I found it to be an enjoyable, easy, and at times very insightful read.""Insignificant Others"" features a protagonist, Richard Rossi, who is a witty narrator who often speaks in a manner that reeks of Oscar Wilde. The novel starts out quick and engaging, but after the first 100 pages it lost a little of its shine for me. Still enjoyable to read, just not as much as it had been at the beginning of the text.Some readers may get a little aggravated at the numerous characters in the book that have names beginning with the letter B. There is a Ben, Billy, Brandon, etc. and although it is a minor quibble it can cause some unneeded confusion for the reader. Another annoying factor for me was the narrator's smug political opinions. I realize that the author was giving the character this trait purposefully but it gets to be a bit much, especially if you don't agree with his political opinions. However, it does serve a purpose in the story because Richard Rossi throws himself into political diatribes to avoid real life issues.Some people have said that the novel has too many characters, most of them very underdeveloped. I would agree that this is true, but I think it mimics most of the relationships we have in our lives with casual acquaintances, coworkers, buddies at the gym, etc. In our day to day lives those people fit in one specific category and we don't see them outside of that box. It is a nice touch in the text, but I understand that it can frustrate the reader.The novel also has some lovely strong suits, for instance a very intense and awkward dinner scene that Richard and his partner share with friends is a highlight of the book. I also especially enjoyed the character of Doreen. She was fun to get to know and McCauley imbued her with a very distinct dry voice that was nothing short of delightful to read.I do admit that the ending of ""Insignificant Others"" is too convenient and maybe even a tad hokey. However, the last 30 pages have some great lines / observations about human nature that even when taken out of the context of the novel are really quite good.

It is unflinching in its portrayal of ignorance, incest, rape, violence, and sex. Despite the bleakness of moments of the text, the novel is (oddly enough) also funny. Very funny at times. Even in the darkest scenarios there can be moments of pure pleasure.The novel is set up as a series of letters from the book's protagonist, a woman named Celie, to God. This is an effective device, and serves the text well. As Celie grows and matures the tone and even style of the letters change. It is a thoughtful character progression that gives the novel its depth. Just as the letters to God device starts to get a little tired and belabored Ms. Walker transitions from Celie writing letters to God to letters between sisters, Celie and her sibling Nettie. The shift is deftly handled as a seamless transition that propels the novel forward.When Walker introduces Nettie's letters into the text the book flags a little, mainly because in Nettie's early letters about Africa Walker gets didactic while trying to preach through her character. It is obvious, and it gets old quick. However, the moment passes (Walker either abandoned this tone or she got more subtle) and the plot once again becomes important.Celie's second letter to Nettie, after she stops writing to God, is the thematic center of the book. It is also an interesting and quite brilliant dissertation on what God is and means to some people. This chapter appears on pages 192-197 in my edition. As I mentioned it is a thematic shift in the book because once Celie gives up on other's views of God and finds her own, she subsequently finds herself. She grows by leaps and bounds, and her life improves as a result.After the pain and trials of the first 250 pages of the book, the last 30 or so are a simple joy to read. ""The Color Purple"" ends on a very positive and uplifting note, and I for one am grateful for its message about the power and simplicity of redemption and grace in our lives. On page 283 Walker, through the character of Albert, writes some of the purest and most beautiful language of the text. It was a highlight of the novel for me to see such an ugly man grow into a decent human being. The ending of the novel is astounding and happy, unabashedly sentimental, and profound.

The language and unique syntax that Brian Doyle employs is wonderfully evocative. It is simply gorgeous at moments. However, it is not enough to sustain 319 pages, and after a while because the plot is so simple (not a bad thing) it starts to grate on the nerves. Mr. Doyle's use of adjectives gets a little carried away at times. In fact, I found it downright tedious, and thought the author was trying to be cute and literary with language. I would not have felt this way had he been more judicious in his use of stylistic extravagances. Long stretches of this book I would give a 3 star rating, and other parts I would give a 5. It really is an inconsistent text, but I am very glad that I read it. ""Mink River"" is better than most of the stuff out there...but it could have been great. The talent is obviously there.The novel is a lot like the recent book ""Knockemstiff"", and the older ""Winesburg, Ohio"", in that it follows the lives of various members of a community. However, it is happier and more uplifting than either of those texts. When the book follows a traditional narrative, actually tells a story, it is very good. The first 150 pages of the text are a drag, but after that it becomes more narrative in nature and I got invested in it. However, when half of a book borderline bores you, there is a problem. The reason it took me so long to get into is because Doyle has one of his main characters tell these long history of ""the people"" (Native Americans) stories and the digressions bored me after the first few. There were no real elements of plot in them, and thus it was very easy to read them and not remember immediately afterward what you just read. It happened to me on more than one occasion while reading.I read ""Mink River"" for a book club, and my appreciation of the text was greater after our discussion. There is a lot there, and one of the most effective aspects of the text is that I know the characters. They were very visceral and real to me, and that was achieved primarily through Doyle's effective use of repetition, and subtle characterization. He is clearly a talented writer, and this is an extraordinary book.

This is not a hit piece, as some ers assert, but rather a biography of the man, not the image he cultivated to sell his books. They are two very different things. Charles Shields is a fan of Vonnegut's, even going so far as to call him ""an extraordinary man"" in the text's Introduction. However, he does present him truthfully, and it seems that many fans can't handle that. I too will admit that I don't like finding out how much Kurt Vonnegut was not the man in real life that he used as his persona for the author of his novels. It makes me a little sad, but close reading of Vonnegut's nonfiction pieces alerted me long ago to his bitterness and mean spirit. I just conveniently ignore it. However, Mr. Shields must be truthful in this book, and he is.I'll start with bringing up some negatives about the text. On a minor note, there are a few factual errors and inaccurate statements about a couple of Vonnegut's novels. Not a big deal which I am sure will be cleared up in later prints of the book. Of more consequence (to me) was how Mr. Shields inserts his own opinions about Vonnegut's novels occasionally into his examination of them. I don't like this. I am fine with him examining critical receptions and reader responses to the works when they appeared, but his personal thoughts on them should be left alone. It detracts from the objectivity he as the biographer should be trying to create.However, Mr. Shields shines when he examines Vonnegut's life and the manner in which it found its way into his masterpiece ""Slaughterhouse-Five"". This part of the text is very well done, as is a lovely section on thoughts about the nature of ""art"" that Vonnegut shared with his scientist brother Bernard. The conversation is recounted on pages 394-396 of the text and is a highlight. The book also ends with an interesting (and short) history of Vonnegut's ancestors. I am not sure why it ends the book, but it is informative none the less.On a personal note, if ""And So It Goes"" and Vonnegut's life feature a villain it is Vonnegut's second wife Jill Krementz. If half of what appears in this text is true (and it is all footnoted in the bibliography) then she was and is a horrible woman who did much to bring despair and pain into Vonnegut's life. The reader will hate her, and be exhausted and troubled by Vonnegut's never washing his hands of her. Mr. Shields never says this, but I get the feeling he was not too fond of her.As the first authorized biography of Vonnegut (he was working with Shields when he died) ""And So It Goes"" is an important text. One of the most important writers of the last century deserves a biography, and now finally he has it....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Feb 12, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10816769-and-so-it-goes

Clare Asquith has written a book that explores Shakespeare's Catholi""Shadowplay"" is a surprisingly quick read if one has an interest in the material. Clare Asquith has written a book that explores Shakespeare's Catholic politics (her thesis) and then proceeds to interweave a chronological analysis of these beliefs as presented in code in his plays. This she intermixes with what is happening in historical England at the time. The result is intriguing to say the least. Whether or not it is true is another matter.First off, I strongly feel that this book is not worth your time if you have not read most of Shakespeare's work, including the narrative poems. There are too many very detailed references to his plays, plus numerous spoilers of some of his lesser known works. I would imagine that if you had not read the play that Ms. Asquith was referencing the text would be hard to follow. The book is also written in an academic style and I believe it would not be enjoyable for someone who is a casual Shakespeare fan. Historical knowledge of the period is also a major plus. When I was unfamiliar with the Shakespeare text she was examining I could usually follow the historical references she was connecting to the play.Ms. Asquith makes compelling arguments for her thesis, but sometimes she assumes too much for me to go along. I first noticed this in the section of the book called ""By My Two Faiths"" where too many leaps are taken without any proof rendered. I also could not go along with Asquith's contention that the character of Hamlet was a surrogate for Sir Philip Sidney. It is an idea she does not adequately provide evidence for and I thought it a bit much. However, her weakest leap of faith is her conspiracy theory about Shakespeare's play ""Henry VIII"". Again, no evidence is given other than conjecture, thus her assumptions are unconvincing. Her thoughts on this play are the stuff of movies, and do her considerable book and her obvious intellect a disservice.Still, there are moments in the text where Asquith's ideas seem the only plausible explanation. This is especially notable in her section on Shakespeare's sonnets. Her study and interpretation of them give many of these pieces a sense and lucidity that they never held for me before I read her ideas about them. Also compelling is her argument for ""Twelfth Night"" as a coded work. Her connection between the plot and action of the play and historical context are very well done. It is hard to not be convinced by Ms. Asquith when she renders support for her ideas.I won't speak to the validity of the premise of ""Shadowplay"". Arguments for and against Asquith's theories have ample support. But one thing I will say is that I do not feel that ""Shadowplay"" is a text to be taken lightly, and I certainly don't see it as a disservice to the study of Shakespeare. Your appreciation of the Bard will be enhanced by this text, whether you agree with Ms. Asquith or not. I still don't know how I feel about her ideas, I am inclined to disagree with them, but I am glad that I read this book....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,not set,"Feb 12, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/908957.Shadowplay

The book just did not do all that much for me, and although it is a quick and easy read, I was ready for it to be done.

However, I did not feel like he was a dope that you would root for.The most entertaining and worthwhile parts of the text are the moments where Justin's father takes center stage, and there were far too few of them for me to thoroughly engage in the book. Perhaps this premise has now been stretched too thin for the material that exists and Mr. Halpern needs to try something else. I don't know.For what it is ""I Suck at Girls"" is an okay read. I was just expecting more. Halpern's observations about romance, love, bad sex, etc. have nothing new or interesting to say, and I guess I was hoping that they would.I don't regret reading this book, but I am also glad that it only consumed a couple of hours of my time.Take that for what you will....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Feb 12, 2016",,Audiobook,view (with text),/book/show/13425393-i-suck-at-girls

However, the resolution of this play brings all of the subplots together nicely in a satisfying (and convenient I admit) resolution that is one of the happiest endings in all of Shakespeare.By the way, I give ""Cymbeline"" a 4 star rating compared to other Shakespeare, not to literature as a whole. The Bard is in a class of his own.""Cymbeline"" shares a lot in common with the play that Shakespeare wrote soon after it, ""The Winter's Tale"". Many readers don't like these late Shakespeare's but I love them as their themes of grace and redemption resonate mightily with me. The two male leads of both plays (Posthumus and Leontes) also share common traits, as both are quick to anger, rage, and willingness to believe the worst about their spouses. And both are the unworthy recipients of the redeeming power of forgiveness and grace.Act 2:4 is a highlight of this dizzying play as we get to see one of Shakespeare's lesser villains, Iachimo, toying with Posthumus, who believes he is a cuckold. Iachimo paints such vivid pictures in the jealous mind of this dupe that he backs Posthumus into a corner with sexual imagery. The cat enjoys toying with this mouse, and it makes for delightful reading!This play also boats the richly drawn character of Imogen, the daughter of the king of the title and wife to Posthumus. She is a great Shakespearean heroine, especially in Acts 3 and 4 of this play. In those two acts she is on par with ""As You Like It's"" Rosalind, who is in my opinion Shakespeare's greatest female creation. Imogen is almost too well drawn a character for this play, such is her vivacity and delight for the reader.Act 4:2 contains one of the more famous aspects of ""Cymbeline"", a very simple and touching elegy that is spoken over the grave of one of the characters. To my mind it is one of the best statements about death in all of literature. In fact, it is often quoted at funerals to this day. In context it is spoken by two brothers at the grave of their friend/adopted brother, and it is what every living soul hopes for the dead.This is a play that is not easy to read, and will require a commitment from you. With its large cast and many plotlines you cannot pick this text up at random. However, if you stick with it and focus on it you will experience a gem of the Shakespeare canon.As for the Pelican Shakespeare series, they are my favorite editions as the scholarly research is usually top notch and the editions themselves look good as an aesthetic unit.

Mr. Collins repeatedFor a text that is essentially about historical publishing and modern book collecting ""The Book of William"" reads like a mystery. Mr. Collins repeatedly ends his chapters with cliffhanger lines that transition into his next point. It works well, and makes for exciting reading. Collins deftly traces printed Shakespeare through the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries with the gusto and depth of a literary detective. You almost feel like you are reading investigative reporting at times. An unusual take considering the subject matter, but it works!Paul Collins' book is in essence about the ""First Folio"" of Shakespeare's works, with a few (nicely done) digressions thrown in. He writes in a colloquial style with a lot of common vernacular, and anyone could pick this book up and follow it, even with no knowledge of Shakespeare and Elizabethan history. Yet, this text is not dumbed down, and there is much new knowledge to be found in its pages, even for someone who reads everything Shakespeare related that they can get their hands on.""The Book of William"" contains many historical nuggets that most people will not be aware of, and Collins especially shines when he writes about the ""Printer Wars"" of the 1730s. It is a great tale, and explains the proliferation of Shakespeare as printed texts. It was a very key moment in the history of Shakespeare's modern legacy, and it was the first time I had ever heard of it. Another excellent moment in the book is when Collins writes about thumbing through Dr. Johnson's copy of the Folio. It becomes a quiet rumination on what books tell us about their owners, and it is simply lovely.Of course no book dealing with Shakespeare's First Folio can ignore the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington DC, and this book gives us an intriguing account of the mysterious place and its many mysteries.Curiously the text ends with a chapter focused on Shakespeare in Japan. It is odd, and yet it seems to work. I am not sure why. It is also informative, which is a plus. A Japanese view on Shakespeare is not something that comes up often in English language books, and I am still not sure why it gets the depth of attention it does in this text.""The Book of William"" has less to do with the Bard and his plays and more about how the Folio (and its sequels) helped shape Shakespeare's modern legacy, which leads to how subsequent generations came to view him and his work.

Having paid 3 dollars for it I was not that disappointed in it. I could not say the same if I had paid more. ""The Bedwetter"" is funny at times, but not laugh out loud funny like some of these Amazon s suggest. The humor does get vulgar, especially in the second half of the book, but for anyone who knows Sarah Silverman there should be no news there.The text is surprisingly touching when Silverman talks about her childhood depression. She writes one of the most simple and accurate lines about depression that to me encapsulates wonderfully what it means to be in the throes of despair. I won't spoil it here, but it appears on page 34. Another strong suit of the text is when Silverman writes about her identity and how she formed it. It is witty and funny, and unlike many parts of the book does not seem forced.One part of the text that detracts from it is her section on diary writing. It bored me. However, I freely admit that might have been intentional on Silverman's part, as her contention is that diary writing is mostly awful and indulgent. The text also falters when it gets political. I just don't like this aspect in a comedian's book. Indulge her views, if you disagree with them, and move on.Many s have said the second half of the book falls a bit in quality and focus, and I would agree. I read this book in bits and pieces over a week or so because it could not hold my interest for a sustained period. Perhaps numerous reasons for that, but the second half of the book does not help. Silverman ramps up her fake humility in this section, and it comes across as grating and self-pitying. The humor also descends to sophomoric all the time, and then the book ends with an Afterword that is just plain stupid. It knocks all faith, except Judaism, which I think is a little cheap on Silverman's part. Do all or nothing.

The Bard is in a class of his own.Act 1 of thFirst off, I give ""Henry V"" a 4 star rating compared to other Shakespeare, not to literature as a whole. The Bard is in a class of his own.Act 1 of this perennial favorite play of Shakespeare's is only exposition, letting the audience see Henry receive justification for his impending invasion of France. It is dull. Very dull at times. However, stick with it, as it ends on a high note with a great exchange between Henry and the French ambassador.There are numerous highlights of the play, but my mind is especially drawn to Act 4:1 when Henry walks in disguise among his troops on the eve of battle. Shakespeare gives us the perspectives of the leaders and common soldiers during a war, and he arouses our sympathy for both. An interesting thing I observed was how even in war and battle the obsession with class distinction that was a hallmark of that period in English history is pervasive throughout the text, reminding us that Shakespeare was indeed a product of his time. It seems ridiculous to the modern reader, but in context it is not out of place at all. Act 5:2 is another high point for the play where we get to see Henry's blunt, and I think honest, attempt to woo Katherine. It is humorous for its self deprecation and awkwardness which any person who hates the game of flirtation and dating will understand and appreciate. Some things simply transcend time.Henry V is the perfect Machiavellian, especially in Act 4:3 when he delivers the iconic ""St Crispian's Day"" speech. The speech is really a bold faced lie with the king telling the common soldiers who will die in his war that they are ""noble"" and ""his brothers"", when really they are shedding blood to increase his power base. Or is he a patriotic hero and a lover of England? Like most good leaders, Shakespeare seems to be saying that he is both. You read this speech and you know you are being manipulated, yet your blood cannot help but quicken.The best drawn, and really only complex characters in the text are Henry, Fluellen, and perhaps the shady Pistol. Though all three are vastly different: one a consummate politician, one a simple loyal loudmouth, and the last a deceitful and ""me first"" vagabond, we see that actually these three characters share these qualities with each other, and the only thing that separates them is that one of the qualities is more pronounced in one than the other two. An interesting point being is being made here by the author.Finally, I love the Chorus who begins each act with begging the audience's pardon for the dramatic license being taken with the historical story, and who then fills in many blanks that the reader does not get to witness first hand. The appeals the Chorus makes to the audience's imagination is what all dramatic literature should strive to do, and I enjoyed this narrative device.As for the Pelican Shakespeare series, they are my favorite editions as the scholarly research is usually top notch and the editions themselves look good as an aesthetic unit.

It is a device that gets a little tired. But I will give him his due, he does write them well.

Especially funny are the moments when the above mentioned characters talk politics. Their views on the Constitution, and especially heinous misreading of it, are a real delight.Hiaasen always does a very nice job of creating a large cast of characters who weave in and out of the central plot of the book. In ""Lucky You"" he does a masterful job of keeping the characters distinct and separate, and yet loosely connected in a pleasing and easy to follow manner.The main female protagonist of this novel is a black woman, and I was annoyed at how much Hiaasen made her harp on race. I feel it was more him exercising his white liberal guilt rather than a story enhancing plot /character point /trait. However, there were a few nice thoughts in the book about the irrationality of hatred and racist thought, so I can forgive his overzealous attempt to make a rather belabored point.The last 10 pages or so of this novel are not very good.

However, it is also quite obviously his most Christian. The text's protagonist, Eliot Rosewater, is nothing short of a benign Jesus figure. Numerous biblical references throughout the text are used as corollaries to Eliot's life and the plethora of those references make Vonnegut's point pretty obvious for the reader.This text is less plot driven than many of Vonnegut's other works, but its themes and importance I think are far superior to many of his better written novels. The first 100 pages or so can be a little dull (not normal in a Vonnegut text) and the slow start is something his readers may not be used to. However, the text does build to what I think is a wonderfully written and executed conclusion.Two highlights of the book are Eliot's baptism ""sermon"" for two twin boys that he is asked to baptize. Eliot has no religious titles or significance, so he just speaks to his hope for the boy's futures, ending with a simple and profound statement, ""God damn it, you've got to be kind."" Another excellent moment in the text is a biting letter written by an orphan named Selena who is serving as the maid in a rich household. The letter is written to the man who runs the orphanage that she came from, and it has the bite and sting that can only come through the eyes of a child. Vonnegut is at the top of his game in these sections.Further highlighting the idea of Eliot as a Christ figure Vonnegut has Eliot well aware that those he helps are ingrates at best, and almost all are undeserving of his generosity and love. It is a great strength of the text that ""God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater"" freely admits that the people who need the help the most are often the most undeserving, and the acknowledgement of that is a great strength of the book.The most blatant Christian references, and I think the most powerful parts of the text, start on page 264 when Vonnegut has his go to character (Kilgore Trout) explain what Eliot was attempting to do by helping anyone who asked, regardless of the circumstances. The 6 pages where Trout ""explains"" the ""experiment"" are worth the price of the book alone. They are stunningly simple and beautiful. I was trembling with joy as I read them. It is really nothing less than a secular Sermon on the Mount.I won't ruin the end of the book here, but Vonnegut completes the obvious Christ archetype with Eliot in a manner that is unexpected, true to the character of Eliot, and perfect. And then Vonnegut in that way of his stops writing, it is over, the end. The rest is up to you. Very few novels make me think about my obligations to others in this world, this book did. It has stuck with me, and will.

It can be biting at times, but much of the time it feels hackneyed and annoying. I always read a couple of Dorsey novels on the beach every summer, and they are hit and miss. ""The Big Bamboo"" is a miss most of the time. I have read nine Dorsey novels so far, and ""The Big Bamboo"" is in the bottom three. However, for mindless beach reading I still think Tim Dorsey is one of your better options.For this novel Dorsey brings back much of Serge's extended family, a concept he introduced in the much stronger (and funnier) book ""Cadillac Beach"". Also in attendance is Serge's sidekick Coleman, and for the first 100 pages or so Coleman is a whiney and boring character foreshadowing what he was to become in Dorsey's recent Christmas book, ""When Elves Attack"". It feels like Dorsey does not know what to do with this character anymore, so maybe it is time to retire him for good.Dorsey is especially vicious when satirizing actors who don't live in the real world, and when he mocks the vapid and insincere talk that spews from the mouths of most movie executives. The reader cannot help but take pleasure in the way he treats such characters in this book.The novel's dénouement leaves a lot unexplained and is a little weak. I am not sure if Dorsey is mocking Hollywood endings here, or if it is merely feeble writing. Since I think Dorsey has talent I am going to assume the former.An okay read, but he has produced much better....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Feb 09, 2016",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/341402.The_Big_Bamboo

Unlike many books in the fantasy/ horror genre ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire HuntThis is not a book I expected to like; however, I enjoyed it quite a bit. Unlike many books in the fantasy/ horror genre ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"" is actually decently written. The novel is set up as if a writer is exposing for the world the secret journals written by Abraham Lincoln so that the historical record can be set straight. The journals are provided to the writer (who shares his name with the text's author) by Lincoln's vampire mentor.Seth Grahame-Smith does a clever job incorporating mysterious and interesting historical incidents into the novel's plot and making them seem entirely plausible in the context of the world he has created for this book. Incidents as far ranging as the missing colony at Roanoke Island, mysterious death of Edgar A. Poe, and even the conversion of Stephan A. Douglass (Lincoln's debate adversary)to saving the Union just before the Civil War, and his unexpected and sudden death are incorporated into the storyline in a ""plausible"" manner. Grahame-Smith entwines nice little nuggets into his book for his readers who also actually know the real history to catch. I appreciated that very much. It kept the story from veering so far into fantasyland that I could not go along. What we know of the actual Lincoln is deftly incorporated into this fantastical depiction of him in a seamless manner and it allows the reader to slip into the fantasy of the story even more thoroughly.An unexpected, and pleasant, surprise for me was the numerous Shakespearean references peppered throughout the text. This was a brave choice for the author considering the targeted audience for this book, and especially clever is Grahame-Smith's use of a misquote from Shakespeare's ""Julius Caesar"" that takes on a huge relevance later in the novel.One element of the book that I did not like was the inclusion of photo shopped pictures throughout the text meant to give credibility to the idea of this story being actual history. Almost all of the photos used are iconic or familiar to anyone with a passing knowledge of the period and it just seemed hokey to me, and detracted from the story, to alter them. The book would have benefited their being cut by the editor.The ending of the novel is easily its weakest section as it just reads as trite and cheap. I won't ruin it here, but I simply did not care for it. However, I don't have a better idea for an ending to the story, so there it is.

There is some sharp satire on musicians and the music industry in those parts of the novel. Unfortunately when the text steers into the romances and miasma of the relationships of the band's members I was very bored. Mainly I think because I did not care for the characters. As a result I could not celebrate the tidy and reader friendly conclusion because I was not invested in the character's happiness.The book received a two star rating from me because of the interesting ideas Mr. Lethem presented through the character of Carl the complainer.

I know this book was written late in WFB's life, and maybe he was past his prime, so I am giving him some allowances in that regard.I really cannot praise this text, so I will give some reasons why I was so disappointed in it. First off, the book suffers from horrid characterization. WFB has a tin ear for female characters in particular. Not a single female in this text seems real; they are all one dimensional or stereotypical. Particularly painful to read are any scenes between the main female character Henri and her friend Amy. In general the dialogue in the book is wooden and plodding. The text is so melodramatically written that there is no nuance or subtlety anywhere. Especially embarrassing is a denouement that also incorporates the news magazine ""60 Minutes"" that is not only completely unrealistic, but also (for lack of a better word) stupid. ""The Rake"" is simply too heavy handed and obvious to have any real suspense. WFB telegraphs his intentions to the reader, almost like he does not trust us to think it through. Buckley's attempts at integrating French (the language) into the text also seem contrived. The book begins and ends with lines written in French, I guess so that we know that WFB spoke the language? His attempts at creating a southern dialect are also the stuff of junior college creative writing classes. Amateurish and painful to read.Plotting is also very weak in this book, with too many digressions from the main story, all with no discernable purpose. Examples abound, including a ridiculous story (brought up out of nowhere, and then dropped) involving one characters' college roommate and plagiarism on a term paper, and another involving a characters' status as a former Miss America. To all of this the reader can only ask ""why?""""The Rake"" is an easy and quick read; it is just not a very good one. It is just another clichéd story that has been told much better, by other writers in much better books.

I lovI read Tim Dorsey novels every summer when I go to the beach, and I have to say that ""Cadillac Beach"" is the best of Dorsey's first seven books. I loved it. Great fun is had all around. In ""Cadillac Beach"" Dorsey brings back all of the usual characters (with the exception of Coleman, who if I remember correctly was dispatched in the previous book) and we get the usual humorous results.Early in the novel Dorsey sets a highly comedic tone when Serge offers physic readings for drivers stopped at an intersection. They are a laugh out loud highlight of the book. Serge's rant about what ""makes him angry"" on page 19 of the text is nothing short of genius. It is a rant against the continual decline of American brains and brawn, and it is a spot on indictment of contemporary American culture.In a different take on the character of Serge, ""Cadillac Beach"" features much less killing from Serge than in previous novels. Much less. In fact, most of the violence in the text is perpetrated by other characters, and overall the violent content of the book is rather subdued for Dorsey. Another feature of the story that I enjoyed is how wonderfully tolerant the character of Serge is. I really love this quality about him, and his views on homophobes (page 320) are priceless.Oddly enough, for a book like this, I kept annotating some wonderful gems of writing scattered throughout the novel. Numerous times Serge says something that is brilliant advice, even when taken out of context. I won't quote examples here, but one such great example is found on page 211 of the book.The plot of ""Cadillac Beach"" is convoluted and all over the place, and spans 40 years, but Dorsey does a great job pulling the disparate storylines together in a much tighter and cleaner manner than he has in some of his previous novels. The book features a ridiculous denouement, but Dorsey's skill makes it play as believable.I was very satisfied with this read.

One rather high minded and philosophic, and the other an early form of satire. I will break this  into two parts, examining each play as a separate unit.First up is ""The Misanthrope"" which is a joy to read, if for no other reason than the witty and razor sharp wordplay of its leading characters. This play focuses on Alceste a man who hates all forms of hypocrisy and social niceties. I read a critic who once referred to his character as ""a man in the world, but not of the world."" It is an apt description. Alceste hates when people are ever less than 100% honest, in all matters, yet he is in love with a women named Celimene who is an incurable gossip, two faced, dishonest social climber. Alceste coming to terms with who he has chosen to love is really the crux of the play, with Moliere throwing in some sharp criticism of the courtly life of the French upper class, and some barbed commentary on when one should prize the truth above all others. A definitive answer is never given, and Moliere seems to be saying that there is a middle ground between dishonesty and 100% fidelity to the truth that most reasonable people occupy. A quick and delightful read, but be warned. Only see this play in performance with a good cast and stellar director. Otherwise it can quickly descend in performance to people just spitting out aphorisms and philosophy. The play is much more than that and the characters are real, but onstage it would be easy for weak performers to slip into caricature.As for ""Tartuffe"", it is a more enjoyable play in performance than ""The Misanthrope"". I have seen professional productions of both, but ""Tartuffe"" has a scam artist and sex, and that does make good theater. Of these two plays ""Tartuffe"" is the more accessible to the casual reader, and it has a lot to say about the extremes of religious piety and religious hypocrisy. Moliere seems to be encouraging the reader to be somewhere in the middle of the two, and personally I agree with his even handed views. Although some have argued that this play is an attack on religion, and I readily admit that the most ""religious"" characters in the play are the biggest fools, I don't feel Moliere is attacking the institution as much as he is attacking how it is practiced. I argue this because the character of Cleante often speaks very highly of morality, when it is practiced with sincerity and regard for others.All in all, both plays are worth reading, and adding to your library, and this handy volume fills the bill nicely. Neither piece will disappoint, and each is relevant to the modern reader.

I saw it on a table at a bookstore and picked it up. As a runner myself, the premise intrigued me. Unfortunately this text lives up to every stereotype out there about gay men. This is made more distressing by the fact that the author is a gay man, and one would hope he of all people would not engage in stereotypes of himself and his peers.Stereotypes that I found particularly irritating included...-the idea that gay men cry every time one of their friends make a clichéd / trite statement, such as ""look how far we have come"" etc.-that gay men are either ""fabulous"", shopaholics, or hedonists who go after the youngest man available to them. There is an inexplicable scene in the novel where many of the book's characters watch video of one of their peers having sex with young men. The reason for this is never explained, and besides being offensive, it is pointless to the story.There are numerous other examples I could cite, but you get the idea. I was disappointed to see these present in this text.As for the writing, I am a little bit more conflicted on this point. For the first 60 pages or so the book is actually decently written. Then it just gets awful. Almost like someone else wrote the last two thirds of the novel. It descends into hackneyed and clichéd scenarios and dialogue. The story does moves along at a quick pace, and the quick pace would be fine if it included character and plot development, but it doesn't.As a runner I did not mind the parts of the text, and there are many, that focused on races, the emotions a runner deals with while training and racing, etc. However, I can see a non runner not appreciating these aspects of the story.There are little moments in the text that are nice, and even some that contain non clichéd sentiments, but they are too few and far between for this book to be worth any serious attention....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Feb 09, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13585542-the-miles

I am not the first to say so, nor will I be the last. I will be honest, it took me about 100 pages or so before I got immersed and really interested in the text. This was mainly due to boredom and frustration with the Vietnam era Marine slang and specialized language that Marlantes uses. However, the text was worth the initial slog.""Matterhorn"" focuses on just a few weeks in the life of one Marine company in Vietnam in 1969, in particular on a Lieutenant Mellas, one of the platoon leaders. Mellas grew on me in a profound way as I read through the novel. Mr. Marlantes has created a rich and wonderful character in this young officer, and I feel him as real as if he lived next door. Lieutenant Mellas is not the officer of movies and hero war myths. That is to say that he is human, and Marlantes does an excellent job fleshing out this character. Early in the novel Mellas' focus on rising up (as an officer in the field, at home after the war as a politician, etc.) is vividly and uncomfortably portrayed. You don't want to acknowledge that you understand his selfish motives. But you do. Scenes in the book where Mellas acts and thinks with only him in mind make you squirm with their uncomfortable reality. Mellas acts altruistically and selfishly, often at the same time. I grew to really understand and love this character. He is the most well rounded character in the book, and as the novel ends Mellas has come to accept, and even embrace the ugliness, the killing, etc. as a part of life. War is neither glorified, nor dismissed. It is just a part of the human condition, for better or worse. No commentary needed.A great strength of the text is the stylistic choices Marlantes made as author. The book is written in an abrupt style that mimics war conditions. Just like in a war, good or bad news comes up out of nowhere and Marlantes does not allow his readers (or characters) time to reflect on it. There are also a lot of names/characters that get thrown at the reader, and it gets confusing. Marlantes does not take the time to develop most of the characters, again mimicking the quick pace of living in war/combat. Further enhancing this style choice, the battle scenes are also tautly written. There is little description, no buildup. They just happen. They are fought, and then they are over.""Matterhorn"" is also a strong text because of how deftly some great thematic issues are raised. The theme of friendship as the main motivator for most soldiers, not country or ideology is an oft repeated theme in the text, and on page 500 the nature of evil in relation to human life is wonderfully discussed. Profound and accessible philosophic musings permeate the last 200 pages or so of the novel to great effect. The novel pounds to its inconclusive (and appropriate) ending with a restless energy that will envelop the reader. ""Matterhorn"" is well plotted and nicely written, and as the last 150 pages contain the crux of the novel's themes, philosophy, and plot elements, it ends on a strong note.There is no way for me to know this, but ""Matterhorn"" feels authentic, not theatrical. Marlantes tells the story he wants to tell. There is no dressing it up, everything comes back to context. This is the way it was, is what the author seems to be saying. He leaves the moral judgments to you. I was moved by his portrayal of combat and the men who have endured it.

Although the four books have varied widely in quality, ""Lydia"" is easily one of the two best.""Lydia"" starts off nicely, quickly engaging the reader with interesting character setup, and it is funny. As with ""Skipped Parts"" (the first book in the series) this one is narrated by Sam Callahan, the middle aged writer son of the Lydia of the novel's title. However, the first person narration is loosely used. Sam is our narrator, but he is privy to information that he is not present for. You have to suspend your disbelief as to how he knows things he did not witness. Sandlin nicely explains this on page 434 when he has Sam admit that as a novelist he ""made up the parts of the story when I wasn't there."" The narrator even goes so far as to say ""I tell stories"" to explain why he shuns symbolism and other literary angles in his writing. Sam as narrator is clearly a stand in for Mr. Sandlin's thinly veiled views on the subject. The narration of the book is nicely rendered, it is a strong suit of Sandlin's, although Sam as narrator has access to, and talks about, very intimate details of his daughter's sex life. It is gross, but the uncomfortable side of sex is nothing that Sandlin has shied away from in this series.There are also many pleasures for the loyal reader of the GroVont series in this text as Sandlin incorporates many elements from his other novels in a clever manner into the plot of ""Lydia"". Examples include a brief cameo from the protagonist of his novel ""Rowdy in Paris"", and the subtle way in which he incorporates a minor incident from his novel ""Sorrow Floats"" as the starting point for a major plot element in this text.The characters in ""Lydia"" are one of the book's main attractions, and personally I was intrigued by the character of Roger Talbot. I liked this smart loner, and wanted to hear more about him. Sandlin is very good at writing loners, and Roger is a nicely drawn character. There is also a remarkable growth in the character of Lydia in this text. I hated her in previous novels, but I loved her in this one. She has grown and mellowed, and it is a testament to Sandlin that he has so realistically created and shared the life span of this character.Another great element of ""Lydia"" is the incorporation of Oly Pederson, a cameo in previous GroVont books, and the larger role he takes in this novel. Sandlin reminds the reader that everybody has some kind of story to tell, and this minor character that many readers may not even remember from the previous works has lived too, even if we don't register it. Oly is almost 100, and his life story is being recorded to preserve some sort of oral history. Oly's story is beautiful at times. It also includes WW I, and Sandlin does an excellent job with the battle scenes as they are vividly written. Oly's tale also comes back full circle to a minor event in the first book of the series (""Skipped Parts"") and Sandlin elegantly shows how tight the circle of life / acquaintance is for most of us.""Lydia"" is told using three intersecting story lines (delineated by the use of 3 different fonts) and they go well together to form a full coherent novel. It also serves to break up the plot for some readers as they never have to focus solely on one story line. As with the best of Sandlin's writing ""Lydia"" demonstrates the power of human truth in literature, and one such moment was when he has a character say, ""...I see that everything you choose to do means giving up a bunch of other things you thought you might do later."" Simple and profound, as are many parts of this book including the final chapter titled ""Loose Ends"". The novel ends on a simple and lovely sentiment, as are the best parts of our lives.Enjoy!...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Feb 09, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10109398-lydia

In detective stories that is a vital element, and here they are lacking.As a character Father Brown is interesting, insightful, and has moments of extreme profundity. His observations about human nature can be keen and often times get to the heart of humanity. However, he comes to these insights in the midst of stories that are dated, at times very hackneyed, and often completely implausible. Obviously this serves to detract from the tales, and yanks the reader out of the world of the story too often for one to completely get immersed in, and thus, enjoy them.I liked this collection fine, but it does not deserve the iconic status some heap on it. Each story starts out slow, and the casual reader will get bogged down in the English colloquialisms and in Chesterton's very formal style. If one gets past that, as I have already mentioned, the writing is a joy. Don't just expect much from the plot, and you will be fine.In the introduction to this collection P.D. James recommends not reading this book in one sitting, but rather reading each story as a separate piece and coming back to it in that manner. I endorse that recommendation. I read a single tale each time I finished another book, and approaching it in that way made its flaws more easily digestible.I am glad that Father Brown is now part of my literary knowledge, and the tales have some lovely moments.

I tore througIn ""Bring up the Bodies"" Hilary Mantel has written a shorter and tighter novel than its predecessor ""Wolf Hall"", and it is just as good! I tore through the book in a few days, and I am eagerly anticipating the third and final installment in the series.Most of the joy of ""Bring up the Bodies"" is Mantel's lovely writing, and her masterful creation and depiction of the series' main protagonist Thomas Cromwell. The story is told mainly from a third person perspective, but it is an omniscient narrator who sometimes enters the minds and thoughts of the characters, so we occasionally get a first person point of view. This stylistic choice further adds to the novel's strengths as a well written text.As already mentioned, one of the main pleasures of this book is Mantel's creation of Cromwell, a historical figure we actually don't know a lot about. Her interpretation of this man is wonderful and full bodied on so many levels. Cromwell's dry humor and accurate/insightful observations about others and our human natures are one of the book's main joys. He is an intellectual giant among worms, and he enjoys himself immensely. His almost perverse pleasure at ensnaring into the web of Anne Boleyn's downfall the four noblemen who mocked his late beloved mentor Cardinal Wolsey in a play years before is an excellent plot contrivance that Mantel's creates to show that Cromwell is capable of pettiness, and is also quite dangerous. Mantel deploys considerable skill in the four scenes where Cromwell entraps each of these four men into his web. He is the perfect Machiavellian, doing a service for his king, and himself at the same time. Another breathtaking moment in the text (among many) is the excellent scene where Cromwell tricks Mark Smeaton (a dandy musician) into ""confessing"" adultery with Queen Anne. It is simply riveting writing.In ""Bring up the Bodies"" Mantel shows Cromwell growing into his power, and thus he is not nearly as likable as he was in ""Wolf Hall"". He is becoming a lot like the people he detests. Mantel is obviously building up his ego and hubris for his downfall, which I assume is the focus of the third/ final book. There are so many ironic and foreshadowing lines that hint at Cromwell's own end that I kept thinking as I read, ""you reap what you sow"". If you know the actual history of these events you will catch these references and it will increase your enjoyment of the book. Pride is such a huge theme in this text, and it trips up so many people that one would be a dunce not to see the larger warnings about us as individuals that we can take from the novel.In short, Mantel's writing is fluid and lyrical and she is the rare storyteller who is also an excellent writer. Although ""Bring up the Bodies"" is less episodic and quicker to read than ""Wolf Hall"" it is no less enjoyable, and I can't wait for the next one!...more",Notes are private!,6,67,1,not set,not set,"Feb 09, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13507212-bring-up-the-bodies

The ""Much Ado About Nothing"" is one of Shakespeare's perennial crowd-pleasers and pops up in performance all the time in classical theatre companies. The reason is simple; it is a fun and witty play. It has some of the best verbal wordplay in all of Shakespeare, and it boasts the only middle aged lovers in all of the Bard's work, the lovely Beatrice and Benedick. This pair of former lovers bicker and snipe at each other with such intensity that the physical and emotional attraction is blatantly obvious form their first moment together on the page / stage.One of the reasons that I keep returning to ""Much Ado"" is because of how deftly Shakespeare handles the leading characters' pride and reluctance to take the dangerous leap into love. It especially resonates in our times when more and more middle aged people find themselves divorced and single. How does one take that risk again, often under the same emotional circumstances as Beatrice and Benedick? When these two finally put aside their pride and open up to each other it is as touching and lovely a moment as any in Shakespeare.Once again as with so many of Shakespeare's best comedies, the characterizations are key to the enjoyment of this text. Bedsides the two leads we get the malaprop prone constable Dogberry, who accidentally keeps the plot from becoming a tragedy, and the subtle characterization of Don Pedro the prince. There is more to this character than one gets at first glance, and the close reader will be rewarded by paying attention to Don Pedro's wooing of Hero for his underling Claudio. Shakespeare adds in layers there that are interesting to ruminate on.As for the Pelican Shakespeare series, they are my favorite editions as the scholarly research is usually top notch and the editions themselves look good as an aesthetic unit. It looks and feels like a play and this compliments the text's contents admirably. The Pelican series was recently reedited and has the latest scholarship on Shakespeare and his time period.

One of the domin""Cat's Cradle"" is one of Kurt Vonnegut's less subtle satires, as he lays his views out there in a very obvious manner for all to see. One of the dominate themes of this text is that when science is weaponized it is always wrong, period. He also goes after his usual suspects: religion, God, and man's inhumanity to man.Stylistically ""Cat's Cradle"" is told in a much more linear format than most Vonnegut texts. In fact, it is told completely in chronological order which is a very unusual device for Vonnegut novels. It is also very funny, but in a very dry, dark humor sort of way. Many parts of the book also feel like a precursor to his ""Slaughterhouse-Five"", which was published six years after this novel. There are some shared characters, and a shared setting, the city of Ilium, NY.""Cat's Cradle"" is at its most biting when Vonnegut depicts the arrogance and selfishness of humanity. The callousness with which the characters (practically all of them) treat the world ending due to man's carelessness is truly frightening. How aloof man can be about his destructive powers. The massive irony of this text is that the world ends by accident! We don't set out to destroy it, we are just careless with our ability to do so, and when one is arrogant and careless...well you know what that can yield. There are no real villains in this piece, just sloppy and short sighted people. Vonnegut seems to be reserving his harshest judgment for the character of Frank Hoenikker. Frank resents that people were not nice to him when he was younger. Yet his treatment as a teenager does not engender sympathy in him, but rather bitterness, and does not lead him to be kind to others. To be that blind and unobservant about your own life is something that Vonnegut seems quite disgusted with in this text.Religion also gets its share of jabs in this book, but unlike many readers I don't see Vonnegut as knocking religious faith, as much as I see him saying that he understands why people need it, he just does not put much stock in it. Like most of Vonnegut's oeuvre, God plays a huge thematic role, and on page 225 of this text Vonnegut gives an interesting and keen observation of the role that God holds for many people. The question is also asked in the text, what is God up too? The answer given is apparently nothing, although Vonnegut does not go so far as to state this. He leaves the role of faith wide open for his readers.Vonnegut also plays with a theme that dominates many of his books, which is the idea of predestination. His invention of the religion of Bokononism is a lovely idea for a religion, although it does not hold up to intense scrutiny, unless you make a lot of allowances for it. And that is the point. Isn't all religion like that to a certain extent?The ending of this novel is nihilistic and hopeful all at once. I am not sure what I think of it, I am almost positive I don't agree philosophically with it, and I am absolutely sure it is the perfect ending for ""Cat's Cradle"". At its heart this is a book about how much stuff (most stuff) we don't really understand. A character occasionally asks ""See the cat? See the cradle?"" when there is nothing to see. There is nothing there, and thus the text's satirical question/ comment on religion and science, which both are in the explanation business. Page 183 in the book aptly brings this home for the reader. Making sense of the world is what science attempts, and in the arena where it matters most it has failed. What next?

She says, ""What makes Iago evil? some people ask. I never ask."" A person who knows who they are never asks such a question. But I don't fully believe that our protagonist is such a person. In fact she, along with the rest of the book's cast of characters, doesn't even seem fully dimensional to me.Stylistically the text is interesting. The chapters are very short, and we are told the story in a nonlinear fashion, with a lot of gaps. This makes the reader feel disconcerted and disjointed, and Ms. Didion was successful in her attempt to make the book's style reflect its protagonist's state of mind. Ms. Didion's writing also reminds me a lot of Hemmingway. ""Play It As It Lays"" is not a text for the casual reader, although it is a quick read. A big stumbling block for me is that I just could not shake the nagging feeling that this text is terribly dated. Its content might have been shocking and useful as tools to express the emptiness of one's life in 1970, but the things it depicts (abortion, S&M, drug use, etc.) is now seen daily on HBO. Didion uses the aforementioned items in a powerful and non-gratuitous manner in the text, but it just does not shock the senses as much now as it must have 40 plus years ago.""Play It As It Lays"" does have many things going for it however. The way in which the abortion and its aftermath are portrayed in the text is difficult to read, and the raw intensity of the emotion shown is tautly and clearly rendered. The protagonist's marriage is also horrifically, and wonderfully, written. They say horrid things to each other. They are downright cruel. It is an unexplainable marriage, and it reeks of reality.I guess the reason why I did not enjoy this text is that I feel it is just a very hopeless book.

I did not find it particularly insightful, but there was nothing wrong with it per se.""Richard II"" is a lyrical treat for the reader, and one marvels at the creation of a character as complex as Richard. King Richard is a hopelessly deluded and inept monarch who believes supremely in the divine ordination of kings. He leans on this belief to the exclusion of all of the king's other responsibilities. He makes one poor decision after another, and never reflects on the choice or its consequences before he makes them. However, we still feel a tug at the heart when this monarch is murdered, and this is attributable only to his glorious poetry. Richard speaks in some of Shakespeare's finest verse, and he has the mind for metaphor. In Act 3:2 Shakespeare gives Richard some of the most beautiful verse he ever wrote. The tragedy in this scene is compounded by the fact that what Richard is talking about (God protecting his divine right to rule) is already proven false to the reader. Ultimately the irony of Richard is that he says such wise things (at times), but can’t bring himself to live those things because they conflict with his image of kingship.I would recommend reading Shakespeare's History plays in order of the king's reign, and one comes to appreciate the complexities and strength of Shakespeare's storytelling. There really are no exceptional characters in this play other than Richard. His antagonist Henry Bolingbroke is a cold hearted dud (and master politician) who plays to the common man and ruthlessly kills those who oppose him. All the while, telling us, and himself, that all his actions are justified and are the results of other's choices. Really he is no different from Richard, except he lacks the King's sense of poetry and theater. There are also some good speeches from secondary characters in this text, especially John of Gaunt. Shakespeare's genius is too large to be contained to only the main characters. ""Richard II"" is a great read, especially for the extraordinary experience of feeling revulsion AND pity for the title character. This edition includes an essay on the performance history of the piece, and interviews with two prominent directors will be of special interest to those who enjoy exploring the multitude of interpretations “Richard II” lends itself to. The Modern Library edition also includes a scene by scene analysis, which can help point out an image or symbol you might have missed. The edition also includes a nice “Further Readings” list specifically for “Richard II”Frankly, all of the extra essays allow you to dive into the world of the play, and it is all included in one text. A personal favorite is the section called “Key Facts” which give all kinds of cool stats specific to that play, which characters have the most lines, % of the text in verse and prose, etc.The RSC Modern Library editions are a nice new trade paperback with worthwhile extras.

Actually it is about how our values are placed on us by the environment in which we are raised and nurtured. He sets up the motif of our lives as peepholes which open when we are born, and close when we die, and that is it. It is a clever and original method of presenting this thought.This novel reads and feels like a typical Vonnegut in its style and simplicity, and I will not complain about that. The novel is told in first person by the protagonist Rudy Waltz (who earns the unfortunate nickname Deadeye Dick early in his life) and once again Vonnegut employs simple childlike language to deceive you into zipping along with the reading and then suddenly finding yourself immersed in the middle of a profound thought. Then you are stuck thinking about it, and it is off to the races. The narrative is told as Rudy recounts for us his life, and for the most part it is told in linear flashback scenes. Vonnegut also incorporates an interesting device here, as Rudy likes to examine bits of his life as little ""playlets"". This device is effective for a couple of reasons as it breaks up the narrative style of the novel, and it also highlights the idea of our lives as short bursts of theater or stories. We are all ""tales told by an idiot signifying nothing.""Chapters twelve and thirteen of this text are mesmerizing in their simplicity and depth of theme, and in chapter twelve especially Vonnegut does something that is nothing short of amazing. He makes you feel immense and deserving pity for a person who accidently and arrogantly shot and killed a pregnant woman on Mother's Day. The reader finds themselves embarrassed when they recognize the fact that we seem to lose our humanity when we are confronted by the worst among us and fail to see that they too are human. Shame on us Vonnegut is saying, and it stings. Of special mention is an editorial that the husband of the murdered pregnant women writes in the local paper. It ends chapter thirteen, and although I don't agree with all of it, wow oh wow is Vonnegut on fire in this part of the book.On page 127 of the novel Vonnegut put his theme right out there for all to see. Rudy has spent his life connecting with no one and nothing. He is a virgin, has no friends, no real career, etc. All of this out of fear of hurting other people. It is foolish nobility, as pain is a part of life and is to be accepted, maybe even embraced as a sign of being alive. Vonnegut seems to be saying that the tragedy in Rudy's, and our, life is not that he has done an awful deed that forever changed his and others lives. It is that he gave up and stopped living once it happened. Vonnegut is warning us... Not you too! You will hurt and be hurt, but live damn it!At one point in the novel a character obsesses about a parachute while flying, wanting to guarantee a safe landing. ""Deadeye Dick"" seems to be saying keep looking, and don't stop flying in the meantime. Many s have said this is a dark novel. I disagree. I think it is urging us to live. At one point a character says, ""This is as much Shangri-Lai as anywhere."" That is the point folks. Embrace your own place in this world, and make it work to some extent. Rudy Waltz is the example of what not to be. Vonnegut is not celebrating him; he is using him as a warning bell.Heed the warning, and read this book....more",Notes are private!,0,33,1,not set,not set,"Feb 05, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9598.Deadeye_Dick

This book shows off more of his talent and not as many laughs, but it is still a very humorous book. And it actually has a point, which is why I suspect some of Moore's fans don't like it. For the record, I have read every book Mr. Moore has put out, and I liked this novel a lot. It is far superior to his last serious effort, the ""King Lear"" inspired ""Fool"".""Sacre Bleu"" does indeed have a slow start, it took me about 40-50 pages before I really got interested in the story and characters. But once I did I was on the hook for the journey. I won't rehash plot points here, but I will tell you that like in ""Fool"" Moore makes many events from history (especially Art History) look like the result of the machinations of some of the novel's main characters, in this case the muse Bleu, and a character known as The Colorman. It is a clever device, and one that makes the reading experience for this text richer. The numerous historical allusions that Moore incorporates into the plot also add to the humorous and witty aspects of the work.Christopher Moore is well known to be an avid researcher, and this is clearly evident in ""Sacre Bleu"". The novel is very well researched and the Paris of the last half of the nineteenth century comes alive in Moore's hands. The book's research also rewards the close reader as Moore incorporates sporadic and quick mentions of minor historical details that make the experience of the novel even fuller. If you catch the details great, if not, no major loss.Some fun bits in the book are how the Paris art scene from 1850 to 1900 is cleverly linked and interwoven in the text. It is not historically accurate, as Moore freely says, but it ties the plot lines up in a nice bow, and makes for satisfying linking of some of the major players in the Parisian art world at that time. I also love how Moore (better than anyone else) incorporates modern speech patterns into historical settings and characters. They pop out at the funniest times, and provide some of the biggest laughs of the book.Moore has an innate skill at seamlessly blending the supernatural and fantastical into ""realistic"" moments in a text. He does this in such an unobtrusive and seamless manner that I rarely, if ever, get disengaged because of some of the more fantastical aspects he invents. That is no minor skill, and he does this with great artistry in ""Sacre Bleu"".At its core ""Sacre Bleu"" is a love letter to the Impressionists and the movements in Art that they spawned and nurtured. It is also a serious comment on what Art is, and how much it takes to create it. And it tells a whopping good story, and is funny.

As a book that will ""bulletproof"" the faith of gay people who come from a strong evangelical background, it will be found lacking.Personally I found the book mostly helpful and I enjoyed Ms. Hodge's honesty in exposing her own warts and issues. She has a bad temper, and often feels the need to get in the last word. Knowing this about herself, and being honest about it, enables her to be very blunt and constructive with her readers who share the same faults. That is a very helpful element of this book. She is also very upfront about the fact that this text is not meant to give you scriptural ammunition to fight those who want to condemn homosexuality. It does not provide that, and with a few exceptions many of her scriptural analysis are not all that insightful. But her heart is clearly in the right place, and that goes a long way with me.I also liked how Hodge occasionally inserts into the text little excerpts that she calls ""Spiritual Survival Exercises"". These are meditations, prayers, and other helpful tools that she has used in her life to help her become closer to God, and having tried most of them some work for me, some don't. Ms. Hodge is just trying to jump start your prayer/thought life with God.However, there are also some flaws in the book that leave it and its subject matter vulnerable to criticism. It is there, as much as I wish it wasn't, and this does detract from the work. First off she uses some ridiculous examples to make her points. She quotes, and comes back to often, Xena the Warrior Princess to make one of her more salient points in the book. Besides being a stereotypical choice to use, it also reeks of pop culture. There are numerous Biblical examples that Hodge could have used to make the same point. There are also a few times where her arguments are very weak and not very sound. I know this because I am a friendly and supportive audience for her views, and even I occasionally rolled my eyes at some of her arguments. If I am doing that, what will her detractors do? I would hate to see the effectiveness of her message lost to such small things, but I am afraid for some people that is exactly what will happen.If you are struggling because you are gay and a Christian or you are just struggling with attacks on your faith, then ""Bulletproof Faith"" is an easy and supportive read that will probably give you some help and solace. That is a good thing; just don't expect more from it then it can give.

However, I am still in the process of figuring out how much I liked it. It is a quick and engaging read and I was never bored or reluctant to read it when I picked it up. I will reread it again someday, and I am going to read the author's (Patrick DeWitt) other novel. So that means the text is a success. I am just not sure how big a success it is.To begin with, there are many things about ""The Sisters Brothers"" that I enjoyed. I loved the stylistic choice of elevated language (reminds me a lot of ""True Grit"" in that way) and the voice of the novel's narrator Eli (one half of a pair of brothers who serve as hired killers for a mysterious man known as the ""Commodore""). The novel also has a quick pace that flows nicely, and the surface story is interesting with enough symbolism and intriguing (and unexplained) moments to allow the reader to do some interesting thinking and discussing about the text. The relationship between the brothers of the title is also well rendered, and though at first glance they both seem to be one way, as you read on and the characterizations get a little more rounded you see that neither of the Sisters brothers is easy to categorize.A criticism with the text is that the elevated language and sharp wit seems to be a trait that every character in the book has. Not one character sounds uneducated, stupid, or even less than well read. That is simply not a realistic portrait of the west coast of the United Sates in the early 1850s. Varying character voices would have greatly aided the novel.Many readers of this book have said that it feels like a story the Coen brothers would film, and I have to back up that assessment. I have a feeling this novel will become a film someday and I would be very curious to see who ends up making it.One thing I appreciated about the text was that this dark story ends with a feeling of redemption, and moving on from the sins of one's past. This might seem a little too tidy for some readers, but the novel ends with a sense of purpose and hope and I found it appropriate.""The Sisters Brothers"" is a good story on the literal and metaphorical level, and would be an excellent choice for a book club.

I don't know many people who have read it, and that is simply a shame! It is a unique text (it varies greatly from the so called ""Vonnegut style"") and is a pretty conventional narrative that deals with many of the standard Vonnegut themes in a more easily accessible manner.The novel is the autobiography of an artist who has become a footnote in the history of Abstract Expressionism and the mid twentieth century art movement in the United States. He is a wealthy inhabitant of the Hamptons, the child of Armenian immigrants, and a man waiting for death. His name is Rabo Karabekian. He also has a secret locked under tight security in his potato barn. Those are all the plot points you are going to get from me.With this rather simple premise, we are given an exploration of the usual Vonnegut fare: God (and man's connection to him) war (especially WW II) man's inhumanity to man, friendship, the accidental nature of life and love, and the power of that divine in all of us...the soul. No one can bring these disparate elements together in a manner more interesting than Kurt Vonnegut, and ""Bluebeard' does so in a very pleasing and rather un-ironic (for Vonnegut) way.""Bluebeard' is written as a sort of diary, from the first person perspective of the novel's protagonist, Rabo Karabekian, and is told in the conventional linear format, with flashbacks seemingly every other paragraph. For Mr. Vonnegut, that is linear! The text has its up and downs, and the reader experiences the highs and lows of Rabo's life. There are no ""spectacular"" moments that pop up in the book, just life moments, some good and some bad. The book builds to a climax that is the most uplifting and life affirming that I have come across, so far, in the Vonnegut oeuvre and I was stunned and pleased by it. It was unexpected, tidy, and very appropriate.Life is good and ill mixed together, but that does not mean that we are not supposed to enjoy it, or be dismissive of its importance. Rather, we are to be as Rabo says, ""A Lazarus"". We all need from time to time to be woken from the dead dreary depression of life. Vonnegut seems to be saying that if we hang on to that hope, and practice it when we can then that is enough and we should be content. I think he might just be right....more",Notes are private!,0,36,1,not set,not set,"Feb 05, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9601.Bluebeard

I zipped through the book, enjoyed the process of reading it, but after it was all said and done I am just not sure that there is all that much to it.To start with a few criticisms...the scenes that take place in the school where one of the main characters (a Sex Ed teacher named Ruth Ramsey) works are downright ridiculous. The life and daily activities that he depicts are nothing like the life of a teacher during the workday. He also strains credibility with the scenes that he has taking place in her Sex Ed classroom. The things she discusses, the behavior of the kids, and also the supposed power of the local evangelicals to alter what is taught therein. In short, the way he depicts these things would never happen. Ironically, the worst parts of the book are when Perotta sets the scene in the schoolhouse. Despite the fact that ""Election"" is one of Perotta's better praised works, in the schoolhouse he is out of his element and it shows.Many have complained that the two main protagonists are unlikable, and they indeed are. I just don't see this as a weakness for the text. In fact, I enjoyed the ""voices"" he created for each of them, and I appreciated that despite their very massive differences (one is very liberal, agnostic, and the other is very evangelical, born again) they do make a human connection, and that is important for people to remember about those with whom they disagree. The novel is written from their alternating perspectives and it helps keep the reader from getting overly annoyed or bored with one protagonist.There are moments where Perotta's depiction of evangelicals is obviously unfair and patronizing, but there are also moments where Ruth (a very liberal character) is shown to be very unlikable, close minded, and actually quite intolerant. I am assuming that these characterization choices were purposeful, but they at times detract from the text. His depiction of the book's token homosexual couple is also very tired, stereotypical, and just lazy writing.Yet, I tore through the book at a pretty good clip, and I enjoyed reading it.

I think I might have liked the book better if I had not picked it up having heard for years how life changing it was.""Catcher in the Rye"" is redundant, irritating, and so introspective at times as to be an unlikable reading experience, but I think that was Salinger's point. The novel's protagonist (Holden Caulfield) is a typical teenage navel gazer who derides everyone else for being part of the problem, while never taking the time to look in the mirror. He is unlikable and selfish although in his heart he does not want to be either of those things. And I guess that is why in the end I like this novel. Holden is a person who wears many masks, but he does not want to. He yearns for real human connection, but he does not know how to create it. That is a problem that most people can relate to. Throw into the mix Holden's questionable sexuality, the death of a younger brother, his painful feelings of isolation and loneliness, and you have one very sad character, and one very human story.This book is not a novel that has an especially interesting plot, or any sort of convenient conclusion. However it is an interesting study in character, and in that most basic of human desires, the ability to connect with others, and the pain that often follows when you allow yourself to love and be loved.I am almost positive I would not have appreciated this book as a teenager, and I am glad that I waited many years before reading it. I would recommend reading it with others so that you can discuss it, and get past its unlikable characters.

I liked this stylistic device, as it works for the protagonists' medical profession, and because often times the footnotes were clever and interesting.

I reread it recently for a book club, and I was disappointed. A lot has happened in the intervening years between the readings, and this work simply does not impress like I thought it would. First off, the novel is over praised to a ridiculous degree. Secondly, it has no real depth. It is a series of scenarios and vignettes with some cameos by historical figures thrown in for good measure. And the point of the text still eludes me. My book club is filled with college professors, English teachers, avid readers of immense education, and the novel fell flat, despite our best wishes for it not to. To appreciate this text, and to elevate its status, you have to project a lot onto it and I don't think that if a book is as profound as ""Ragtime"" supposedly is it should take so much work to make it seem good.Now, that is not to say that I did not enjoy this text. I enjoyed reading it very much. I just don't think there is all that much to it because I feel like the story and characters are very surface. And I believe that E.L. Doctorow did that on purpose, I just can't figure out why.I will praise the book's artistry. Doctorow does a lovely job of interweaving numerous fictional threads and historical figures in a mostly convincing manner. The book stylistically reads like a ragtime piano piece, and the beat of history and progress, and social evolution marches on relentlessly. I get it. But is there anything else sir? If not, the book does not have all that much to say.Also perplexing is what Doctorow intends to show through the characters. In the character of Younger Brother and the black maid Sarah, Doctorow seems to be knocking people who allow their emotional and physical well being to be determined by others. But especially in the character of Younger Brother he belabors this point for way too long, and it does not seem to connect with any other plotline in the text. So, the point is...? Another qualm is his characterization of ""the boy"". This young child has thoughts that are well beyond even the most intelligent small child, and since Doctorow uses this character to express some of his philosophical themes, it reads as very unbelievable because you don't buy that the kid is really having these thoughts. It reminds you of the author, and his intrusion disrupts the story (such as it is) and further detracts from the text.I am disappointed in ""Ragtime"". I wish I wasn't. If I read it again, knowing what I know now, I will probably enjoy it better for the simple fact that I won't expect much of it. Doctorow is a talented writer, and his ""The March"" is excellent and vivid historical fiction.

My reasoning behind this is very simple: the play deals with the ideas of God, faith, daily living, death, our interactions with those we care about (and those we don't) and about the perceived hopelessness of hope. In short, things that we deal with on a daily basis. These fundamental aspects of life are also things that we change our views on as we age and get different life experiences under our belt.I will not attempt to analyze or define this play in this space. I think the myriads of interpretations this text offers are almost numberless. And, I am sure that if I look at this  a few years hence I will have changed many things that I thought about this play. Such is the nature of the masterpiece that Samuel Beckett has created. The two main characters, Vladimir and Estragon, are two friends who alternate between loathing and desperately loving and needing the other. Their interactions are the crux of the play, and on this reading I was very moved by the simplicity and honesty of the relationship that they share. There are also two secondary roles that pop up once in each act, Pozzo and Lucky, and their part in the play serves as one of the more tantalizing mysteries of interpretation. I am still not sure what Beckett is doing with them, and I have read the play twice now, and saw it performed once.The English translation of the play was done by the author himself, and having the original author make the translation is one of the many reasons why I think this text has staying power. Beckett was able to convey his original ideas, in the manner he chose, and thus the English version really is the same play.I don't know if ""Waiting for Godot"" is about our relationship with a God that is silent in modern times, an existential treatise on faith, or is it simply commentary on humanity. Actually I can say confidently that the play touches on all three and much much more. If you have some smart friends read and discuss this work with them.

We have characters that are almost saintly in their virtue and others that seem to be the devil incarnate. And they were all real people, who walked this planet and did the things written in this text. The good and the bad depicted should cause the reader pause and reflection. Where do we fall on that scale?I won't rehash the main plot lines of ""Unbroken"", but I will say that the first part of the book, which focuses on Zamperini's childhood and life as a runner were very enjoyable to me. I mention this only because I have read many s on Amazon that characterized this part of the book as ""boring"". If you have ever been athletically competitive, or are a runner, I doubt you will find the first part of the text to be dull at all.The book as a whole is rarely if ever slow, but personally I found the part of the book that focused on the time the shot down crew of Zamperini's plane spent on a life raft in the middle of the vast Pacific to the most exciting and enjoyable aspect of the text. Ms. Hillenbrand does a wonderful job at creating tension and fear in this part of the book, and this is quite an achievement, since the outcome of the story is well known. There were times that I was in that raft with those shot down airmen and their fear and situation was palpable to me.Ironically, the part of the text where we enter the Japanese POW camps was the least interesting to me (and still I was not bored) only because I found it to be repetitive and slow. Of course, that is precisely what life in a POW camp would be like, so I don't fault Hillenbrand for that at all.My only qualm with the text is that at times Hillenbrand seems to be excusing Japanese atrocities during the war as simply symptoms of their culture, and as something a westerner would not understand. The Japanese Empire was an evil entity, period. To label it as anything else is morally dishonest. Ms. Hillenbrand never goes that far, and as a whole the book leaves one with no doubt of Japanese atrocities before and during WW II, but every once in a whole I felt she was equivocating.

Richard Wilbur's translation of the original French into rhyming English couplets is almost as great an achievement. He is the premier interpreter of Moliere into English, and when you read, or see, Moliere his translations give the plays the most life and lift.If you are familiar with Moliere you know that many of his plays have similar motifs and themes. There is the foolish middle aged man, the smart young female romantic lead, the man she loves but can't have, and a couple of saucy females, usually of the sibling or domestic servant variety. Those familiar plot points are also present in this text. And like most of Moliere, they work here.In short, the play is about a man named Sganarelle who is clueless and petty in every way possible, and who is convinced that his cruelty toward a young ward has resulted in her loving him. Like I said, he is clueless. The play is really nothing more than the machinations of the young ward (a woman named Isabelle) trying to get out from under Sganarelle and into the arms of the man she really loves. The real pleasure of this piece is in watching Isabelle and others use Sganarelle's very character traits against him, and thus achieving their ends with his assistance. The plot barrels along at a very rapid pace, even for Moliere, and it is a quick and delightful reading experience. In the hands of some good actors and a talented classical director, a production would be a very enjoyable evening.Moliere does not yield as many riches as Shakespeare, but he yields more than enough to make reading him worthwhile.

I knew virtually nothing about ""The Sirens of Titan"" when I started it, and I was enthralled by the journey that it took me on. This early work of Vonnegut's, I believe it was his second published novel, plays fast and loose with the themes that would dominate his career: free will, the role/idea of God in a universe that does not make sense, uses of war, and (I think most profoundly) friendship.""The Sirens of Titan"" can be read on a multitude of levels, but I believe at its heart it is about religion, and the destructive and positive powers it can hold over a society. Almost every element of this text comes back to that idea, and Vonnegut does not dare to give a definitive answer. That is the reader's role! While probing these essential questions of humanity Vonnegut riffs on predestination and friendship in a manner that I think is unique, simple, and quite profound.One conspicuous difference between this early work and later texts is the absence of an authorial persona which is a device that would come to play such an important role in subsequent Vonnegut books. Although I like the authorial intrusion in most of Vonnegut's works it was an excellent idea to not use it here. The story stands on its own, you enter its world completely, and as a result you can interact with its ideas without interference. It reads more like an uninterrupted novel than many other Vonnegut texts.I also greatly enjoyed Vonnegut's exploration of friendship and the impact it has on the value of human life. Ironically, this theme was most touchingly explored through the character of a machine named Salo. I don't want to give away plot points, but I have rarely read a text that made me value companionship and people that are dear to me so much. The novel's ending (I won't spoil it) also reinforces to a huge degree this theme.Speaking of the text's ending, it floored me. I was wowed by it, and when I mulled it over in the following days it got to me even more. You will not be disappointed by it.Religion could be a completely manmade construct with no inherent value, or it may be the tool with which we create hope for ourselves in this unknowable universe we inhabit. Vonnegut does not pretend to know the answer, and I don't either. One thing this text does stress however is that if we value our shared humanity, and we value companionship and love, regardless of how the journey ends at least it will have been worthwhile....more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,not set,not set,"Feb 05, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/304752.The_Sirens_of_Titan

First women to hold the post of national security advisor, first black female secretary of state, not to mention her accomplishments in the private sector. Thus leaving politics out of it is really the only way to approach this memoir. This book has 741 pages of text, and to my surprise, I read it rather quickly considering the length. However, if you are not a political, diplomacy, or historical junkie then I would not pick it up.As the full title indicates ""No Higher Honor"" is about Secretary Rice's time in Washington, first as National Security Advisor, and later as Secretary of State. The two jobs are vastly different in their duties and goals, and thus the book is varied in the two approaches. Personally, I found the first part that dealt with her tenure as national security advisor the more interesting section, but I was certainly not bored by either.Some strengths of the text were... I enjoyed her portrait of George W. & Laura Bush. It humanized them, and she obviously knows them quite well. I also liked the details of the infighting that goes on within the president's inner circle. Dr. Rice presents this as a good thing, because dissent sharpens any action that is ultimately taken. To her credit she does not shy away from this aspect of her time in Washington. There are also personal moments and elements from Rice's eight years in DC that she slips into the book from time to time. This reminds the reader that these larger than life people, whom we are reading about, are real humans, not just faces on the television. This makes me even more amazed and proud of the strength of our democracy. Those who run it are like me and you, and that is the way it should be. I was also interested to learn how powerful, and even autonomous, presidential cabinet positions are. It makes me a little scared at how little attention most Americans pay to the folks who hold those positions.One persistent nagging issue I had with the book was that Rice often times present herself as being the most reasonable person in the room. Maybe she was, I don't know, but even if that were true I would have advised her to tone it down a little.

I picked it up expecting it to be much better than it was. If not for those heightened expectations I might have liked it more. Maybe, now I'll never know.First some strengths of the text: the author Chris Cleave has written the book with two alternating narrative voices, both female. The fact that he is a male who wrote (I think) convincingly in a female voice is a testament to his skill. The two narrative voices are also vastly different; one the lyrical and figurative voice of the Nigerian refugee Little Bee and the other a whiney, hassled voice of a professional European woman named Sarah. The alternating narrators also allowed Mr. Cleave to utilize quite effectively the use of narrative gaps in the story. You turned the pages because as a reader there was so much you knew you did not yet know. It keeps you reading if nothing else.Although I liked the alternating approach to the story, I never really cared for either of the narrators and in a book that is supposed to pull your heartstrings that is a big flaw. I think my lack of concern for the characters was because of how unrealistic they seemed to be. I have thought about why this was, and I am still not sure. Besides not caring for the characters, I also felt the story was a little over the top at places and because Cleave was trying to shock us he allowed the human truth of the story to get lost, and as a result the text ended up with neither.A friend of mine summed this novel up best. After finishing it she told me she ""felt like I had read a book, nothing more or less.""""Little Bee"" is just there. It is a nice piece of pop culture lit, but beyond that... eh I just don't know....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,not set,"Feb 05, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6948436-little-bee

It is also very clever and quite an original take on an overused premise. This is the first work of Jonathan Ames that I have read, and I will pick up some others soon enough.As many s here have noted, ""Wake Up, Sir!"" is a very funny book. It most definitely is that, and I got a good chuckle or smile from almost every page. The humor in this text is wide ranging, from the broadly comical and slapstick, to the witty nuances of Oscar Wilde -like aphorism and thoughts. There is something here for almost everyone. Be warned though, Mr. Ames is a writer with no shame and there is much humor in this novel that comes from very vulgar and uncomfortable situations. Know your personal limits before picking this text up. Besides the wonderfully funny moments, Mr. Ames also creates many original, and even profound, thoughts about the nature of human life and interaction. Coming upon nuggets about the truth and beauty of human life, while still giggling about a fart joke is a lovely way to enjoy a novel.One of the greatest strengths of this book is the voice of the novel's narrator, Alan Blair. Blair is an alcoholic novelist, who has more than his share of issues, and he is one witty guy. His narration is one of the most enjoyable aspects of this work. It also seems to be the source of some confusion for many of the ers of this book. I don't want to give much away here, but the premise of this piece is that most of Mr. Blair's world is merely a figment of his imagination, and one of his many devices for coping with a life that is unhappy and unfulfilled. Much of this text is not meant to be taken literally, but rather is about something much larger. To miss that point is to miss the major premise of the novel.I know the preceding is vague, but I can't really say more without ruining the book. A  is not worth that.I greatly enjoyed this text. However, I also accept the fact that it is for a limited audience. It will not appeal to all.

I will be reading more! ""The Bridge of San Luis Although I am familiar with Thornton Wilder's plays, this is the first novel of his that I have read. I will be reading more! ""The Bridge of San Luis Rey"" has been turning over and over in my mind since I finished it a few days ago. I still don't know what to fully say about it. Essentially the novel is asking if there is a divine providence in our lives, or is it merely the acts of our own will. I have read s that argue vehemently that the book comes decisively down in one camp or the other. I am not sure I agree. I think Mr. Wilder is saying that regardless of whether it is human or divine, love is the central theme that makes life bearable, important, and worth toiling through. Whether the love is divinely or humanly inspired is beside the point. I have to say, I find that idea very uplifting.The style of the text is a little difficult for the casual reader to get into, but once you have read four or so pages you adapt to the manner in which Wilder composed this piece, and it flows very nicely. I read that Wilder worked very hard to make the narrator of the text a detached persona, one not emotionally involved in the story. This works wonderfully for the novel, because the fate that befalls five characters when a bridge collapses and sends them all plummeting to their deaths is delivered with a very dry, matter of fact, and objective sense of the event. The details of their personal lives are revealed to the reader in much the same manner, and a big theme of the novel comes through as a result. The emotions that we feel towards these characters as we get to know more and more about them are constructs of our own personal reactions to them, and they are varied reader to reader because of what we bring to the book ourselves. ""The Bridge of San Luis Rey"" seems to be saying that human life is valued in the eyes of the individuals who have some emotional connection to it, and that is much more important than trying to place an individual life in the great cosmic scheme of things. The greatest value in our lives is in how we are loved by others seems to be what Wilder is saying in the very ambiguous, and very brilliant, final ten lines of the novel.Or he could be saying something completely different. That is the goal. What we as individual readers bring to this text is what gives it meaning. To that point, this novel is a favorite of two friends of mine, one an avid atheist and hater of religion, and one as devout and evangelical as they come. Again, what we bring to this work seems to define it, and Wilder wanted that to happen.The current edition has a lovely forward by Russell Banks, and some great information about Wilder and his work on the text. Both are helpful in making the experience of reading this novel even richer.""The Bridge of San Luis Rey"" has shoved its way into my top five list. It is perfect for discussion and book clubs.

Because I cannot have another in my life.”""The Crucible"" is many things. A piece of great American theatre, a gift to actors, and a wonderful read! One thing it is not is a piece of history, so be warned. Too many people read this as a historical text, despite Arthur Miller's explicit instructions in the play's notes to not do so, and thus they miss the forest for the trees. This is not an examination of the Salem Witch Trials, but rather a fictional rendering of a historical event, in order for the modern reader or viewer to examine their own bias, prejudices, hypocrisy, or concepts of honor.To me, this play is about one's man's personal redemption. The protagonist of the play, John Proctor, is a fallen man for many reasons, and the play really traces his moral progression to final absolution through honor, truth, and dignity. The events of Salem in 1692 are used for dramatic purposes to tell this story. And what a story it is.Every time I read this play I feel intense hatred for theocracy and dogmatic religion wherever it may be found, and I also find myself examining my own personal code of ethics and seeing how I stand in the world of moral affairs. I should add this play makes me hate rigid dogma in all areas. Politics, religion, philosophy, science, etc. Mob mentality, politics above all else, etc. are not exclusive to the world of religion or a certain political or scientific philosophy. If you think they are, you are the dogmatic fool this play takes on.""The Crucible"" is wonderfully structured in four acts, each one better than the one that preceded it, and it builds to a crescendo and a very abrupt ending that leaves the reader with a pounding heart, an angry mind, and a moral quandary. No small feat!The text has a very large cast of characters, but in this edition all of Miller's notes are included, and so it reads like a novel, and is a very enjoyable experience, even if one never actually sees it in performance. In the hands of a bad acting company it would be deadly dull, but done well it is exciting. The film version, for which Arthur Miller also wrote the screenplay, is not bad either. Daniel Day Lewis is an excellent John Proctor, and it captures the spirit of the text very well.The climactic moment of the play is preceded by a very tender and brutally touching scene between a husband and wife, both of whom have had their moments of not loving the other one well. My heart ached and soared while reading it.If you don't know this seminal American work, you should. Read it, let it take you on a very emotional journey, and then self-reflect.

Ms Kaling has written a collection of essays that vary between memoir, sketch comedy, observational humor, and social satire. The varying style and tone of the book works very well for what this author was trying to do. It is a collection of random memories and thoughts. It is not meant to be some profound social statement, and as the author herself says in her introduction, ""If you're reading this book every night for months, something is not right.""Contrary to some s posted here, it is indeed funny. I laughed out loud on many occasions. Ms. Kaling has a very dry and subtle sense of humor and her ""voice"" permeates the text. Mindy Kaling is a writer, not her character Kelly Kapoor from ""The Office"", and I think many readers were hoping for the latter.Mixed in with the humor are some very sweet and thoughtful essays. Every high school student should have to read her essay ""Don't Peak in High School"" as truer words were never spoken, and teenagers need to be reminded of this very important fact of life. Her eulogy, as written by a former coworker, is also quite good.As one reads you cannot help but be impressed by Kaling's almost old fashioned work ethic, and sense of family and values. She loves her family, does not engage in one night stands, has no issue with her homework pushing, strict parents, etc. It is kind of refreshing and simple.

It is told as a series of vignettes that come in non linear order. The jumping around is purposeful, as it mimics how memory comes to us, and how we remember and reflect on our past and those that peopled it. These memory flashbacks are interspersed with the linear story of Evelyn Couch and her friendship with a retirement home bound women named Ninny. Flagg has captured small town southern living in the early and mid twentieth century wonderfully, and Whistle Stop is filled with very interesting characters. Too many for me to write about here. Some are good, and some bad, and Flagg refrains from judging any of them. She just presents them as they are, in their own elements, and lets the reader do the rest. To her immense credit, they are very real people. As three dimensional as they come.There are times when I felt the text was a little hokey in that it is not a constantly well written book. However, those flaws are few and far between.

Here Serge's sidekick Coleman (who I have loved in previous books) is reduced to restating as a character what the narrator has just said.

It is a translation from Japanese, and Japanese to English translations are notorious for loosing so much in the switch. The style of the book is very direct with little or no figurative language, foreshadowing, etc. which is not something that many English fictional texts ignore. That alone will lose some readers. The book is also very heavy on Catholic dogma and theology for the first fifty pages or so, and again the casual reader will be confused and/or bored. Honestly, if this had not been a book club text I would not have continued past the first few chapters, but I did, and I am not upset at that choice.""Silence"" is essentially a novel about faith and how one views God. It follows a Jesuit priest who steals into 17th century Japan in order to proselytize and convert. He is captured and the novel`s main plot point is whether or not he will become a martyr for the faith or apostatize. All throughout this process God is silent (thus the title) and the priest, Father Rodrigues, must come to terms with his own faith, outside of the sanctuary of the Church, or even physical safety. Father Rodrigues is culturally ignorant and arrogant and at times I was really disgusted by him. But that is holding a man of the 17th century to 21st century ideals and mores and that is not fair. As a character he is intriguing, and that is enough.Shusaku Endo, the author, leaves the novel's final points ambiguous, and that I liked very much.

I wonder if I had read it before his others if I would be more impressed than I am at this moment.I vacillate between liking and disliking ""Sex and Sunsets"", and I am still on the fence with this one. I guess I'll just document what appealed to me and what didn't and you can decide for yourself.Some strengths of the text were:- The narrative voice of the protagonist, Kelly Palamino. In the vein of most of Sandlin's novels, the first person narrator's voice is one of the best assets of the work.-The premise of this novel is also very intriguing; however, I was not satisfied with how it was explored.-Mr. Sandlin is undeniably a funny and witty writer, and there are some extremely comedic moments in this text.-Another trait of Sandlin's is his ability to incorporate some wonderful, and sometimes startling, truths about life and the human condition in the most unexpected of places in his books. This novel is no exception.Some weaknesses of the text were:-The horribly contrived ending just deflates the reader. It is extremely disappointing and almost ruins the work. The final line of the novel is one of the most clichéd and trite things I have read in a book.-There are numerous times in the novel where Sandlin introduces a very interesting premise, but then leaves it underdeveloped or unexplored altogether. It frustrates the reader, as many of these subplots have the whisper of more interesting possibilities then the main plot.-The object of the narrator's obsession is a very unlikable woman named Colette. It detracts from the wonderful character of Kelly by making this unworthy, and boring, character the object of his undying love.Some ers have complained that the reader never really knows if much of the book is the imagined pining of a feverish and insane man, or actual events, ridiculous though they may be. Frankly, I did not feel strongly one way or the other, and if Mr. Sandlin had explicitly told the reader which it was I am not sure it would have altered my opinion of the text all that much. (Although if the narrator is making up all of the events in his head it does make the ending much easier to swallow.)So, as stated earlier, I feel rather ambiguous about this one. It is not a waste of time to read, but it is not all that satisfying either.

It has been written that Thornton Wilder found ""the cosmic I appreciate this play more and more every time I read it, and I have read it quite a bit! It has been written that Thornton Wilder found ""the cosmic in the commonplace"" in ""Our Town"", and that is indeed the case. This play is a celebration of the everyday and mundane details of human existence. And although we like to imagine that our lives are composed of things larger than the everyday exercise of living, we are wrong. There are exciting and ""big"" moments in most lives, but that is the rarer action. Most of the time we are going about our little sphere doing much the same thing, with the same people; and Mr. Wilder wrote a play that reminds us that this is not at all a bad thing.The three acts of this play are structured in a manner that allows them to encompass the most salient features of human life: everyday living, love/marriage, and of course death. Much attention is usually paid to the third act of ""Our Town"" because it is here Wilder is at his most sentimental and also where he makes his point most obviously. And I don't say that to detract from the play. The third act is brilliant, and gets to me every time. However, the first two acts are subtle worlds of genius that yield even greater rewards as one goes back and rereads them at later intervals in life.Many critics have charged the play with being ""sentimental"" and I think it is, and I don't think this is a negative attribute at all. We should be sentimental about the things we love, and what a sad existence one has if they don't love life. The real punch from this piece though is not from its sentimentality, but rather from the fact that we realize that we don't do what Wilder is urging us to do, even though we know we should. Late in the play, the recently deceased Emily says ""We don't have time to look at one another."" If that was true in 1937, imagine how much more true it is now! And we know what she says is true, and we want to amend it, and for the most part...we don't. There is no greater tragedy then knowing the correct way to do something, and then finding that we don't do it. ""Our Town"" painfully reminds us of this fact of life.This play is worth reading, then reading again, and after another interval, reading again. Unlike many works of drama, it is a satisfying reading experience, regardless of whether or not you see it as a performed play.As one character says, ""I can't look at everything hard enough"". ""Our Town"" does its best to get us to look at the things around us, and to appreciate them. It is a lesson worth returning to over and over again in life....more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,not set,not set,"Feb 05, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/205476.Our_Town

At its core, Tennessee Williams' masterpiece is really about nothing more than that. Everyone wants and needs someone to listen to, and accept, you.All of Williams' plays are about lonely people when you come right down to it. However, ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" is unique in that these lonely characters are part of a large family, and at times are literally tripping over each other. What makes us lonely is our inability to communicate with those that we love. It is in that essential human drive that Williams creates the tragedy of this piece. A father knows his son is a closeted gay man; he loves him, but can't get the son to believe or accept that. A wife knows the truth about her husband, but can't make herself believe it. (Actually that last one applies to two wives in the play, for different reasons.) A man faces death, in essence alone, because he can't admit how terrified he is. And the list goes on. These are the stories of the Pollitt family of the Mississippi Delta. Those particulars are different for all of us, but the essential worries and fears of the members of this family are universal, and have been at the heart of a powerful drama for over 50 years.The witting of this play is luminous and gorgeous. In fact, at times it reads like poetry. However, the power in this piece is also due in large part to the structure of this three act play. The first act is almost a solo from the character of Maggie. The second act is a painful and terrifying duet from the characters of Brick and Big Daddy, and the final act is the ensemble number that builds, and then ends on a slow drawn out note.If you see ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" in performance it is a long play, and at times painful. You will not feel the same intensity unless you let yourself sit down and devour it in one gulp. Read the play in a day, and you will come closer to approximating seeing it in performance than you otherwise would. In the best of possible worlds, you will read it, and then a month or so later see it in a well done performance.This play is the pinnacle of American Drama. You should know it.

However, I can't shake the suspicion that ""Streetcar"" is much more interesting in performance then it is as a piece of literature. Tennessee Williams incorporates the use of interesting metaphors and symbolism that one expects to find in great literature, and there are even times in this text when the dialogue soars in grand fashion off of the printed page. But, I feel this play loses some of its power when simply read as a standalone text. I did not feel that was the case with some of Williams' other work, notably ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"", where just as a text most of the characters simply leapt off the page at you.That is not to say that the characters in ""Streetcar"" are not well rounded creations, they are. However, the central triangle of the piece (between Stella her husband Stanley, and her sister Blanche) would be more dynamic in the capable hands of a trio of actors then it is on the page. These three characters scream for physical characterization more than almost any other characters I have come across in dramatic literature.""Streetcar"" is also a play that needs to be reread. I would read it, give it a few months and read it again. I think some of its themes and messages become a little bit more apparent when approached in this manner. This is one reason why I don't understand why teachers have high school kids read it. Frankly, it is way above their level. The emotions the play tackles are not really felt by teenagers nearly as acutely (or accurately) as they are by people who are approaching middle age.Mr. Williams' writing can wander at times, and the first few scenes of this 11 scene play meander a little, and might therefore lose the casual reader. However stick with it, go on the journey with these iconic characters and by scene 8 you will not want to stop reading as this ""Streetcar"" barrels along to a conclusion that is unsatisfying as it is harsh.

I am very glad that I did, and Erik Larson has a new fan.Narrative nonfiction is a genre that is hard for a writer to do well, and deadly dull if not done ably, but Mr. Larson is not only a grade A historian, but also a top notch writer. ""The Devil in the White City"" is really a lesson about the United States at the turn of the century, funneled through the perspective of the 1893 World's Fair and the story of a serial killer. It seems a ridiculous idea, and maybe it is...but it works splendidly. The text is organized as alternating chapters following either the story of H.H. Holmes (serial killer) or Daniel Burnham (leader/architect of the World's Fair). The structure and pacing of the book is really well done, and the research (as evidenced by the thorough Notes section) is complete and accurate.Although I am a history buff, I am not interested in architecture, or reading about killers, but this book hooked me almost instantly, and I was never dulled or irritated by it. Some ers have said if you don't have an affinity for one of those two topics this text is not for you, but I wholeheartedly disagree.I not only learned about people and events that I knew nothing of, but I also saw how pivotal a moment in American history were the events happening in Chicago in the early 1890s.

This is a""The Homecoming"" was labeled by one early critic as a ""comedy of menace"", and I feel that sums it up better than anything else I have heard. This is a dark, deeply ambiguous, and funny play. I first read this play in college, and then again recently, soon after seeing an excellent production of it at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Ontario Canada staring Brian Dennehy. Being older and more experienced, I feel much better about the play then I did when I first encountered it years ago.I am hesitant to say what the play is about, because even after seeing a very good production, and reading the text closely, there are a myriad of possibilities about how to interpret the script, and the nuances therein. The play certainly is about family relationships, sexual jealousy, gender power dynamics, and many other things to boot. And yet, Pinter never gives us an insight into what he really thinks about these things, and at times I am not even sure the characters do. And it works!A strength of the play are the characters Max and Lenny. In Lenny especially Pinter has created a daunting and very intriguing character that can make the audience squirm in their seats. He is dark, funny, smart, and a pimp. A wonderful role for a talented performer to sink his teeth into. In fact, all of the roles have wonderful possibilities in performance.However, the greatest power in the play lies not in what is said, but rather in what is NOT said. It is there that the reader is stimulated into following up on hints in the text, and making up most of the story for themselves in their head. The infamous ""Pinter pause"" is certainly on display in this work.

That is no small feat. And the book is only about 200 pages long! I am loathe to write much more about the novel as one needs to be familiar with it, to understand any honest evaluation of it.Frankly, I think this text would best be enjoyed by a group and I heartily recommend it for book clubs. It will give you much to digest and talk about, regardless of positive or negative. I also think it is best absorbed when one can discuss its many aspects with another person. As I talked about the book with others and we compared perspectives and analysis the text became a richer experience.One huge quibble I have with the text is that the ""big reveal"" of the book is not that big a reveal at all.

However, he does not give Sam a good story to tell us, and the situations border on ridiculous the entire novel. Occasional absurdity is part of Sandlin's motif, and it works most of the time. However, when absurd is all you are filling a book with it loses its way.To be fair, there are some very brilliant moments in the text, and the opening line of the first chapter is excellent. Sandlin is a gifted writer and can be very profound. But, those moments are too few and far between in this book for my tastes. Especially when compared with some of his other work.What I so enjoy about Mr. Sandlin is that his crazy tales are filled with fully fleshed out people. They are human in so many ways, and the reader can see the reality in them. That is simply not the case in this text. Another major flaw is that almost none of the characters are likable. This is because they are so one dimensional and flat.I am a fan of Mr. Sandlin's, and I greatly enjoyed the first two parts of the Gro Vont quartet.

One thing almost all people who dismiss the man from Stratford have in common is their literary snobbery, and their foisting on the Elizabethan age modern values and ways of living.

His arguments about keeping everything in historical context and about how imaginative literature is created are among the simplest and most profound proofs of the authorship of William Shakespeare of Stratford.If you are interested in some reading about yet another aspect of the phenomenon that was and is William Shakespeare you will enjoy ""Contested Will"".

The chapters about the migrant movement are almost poetry. Although some leave something to be desired others simply soar with excellence. At first I was annoyed by this organization, as I was drawn into the story of the Joad family and hated being taken from it, but then as the novel progressed I got used to the alternating chapter focus and I began to like it. After finishing the text I can't imagine the novel without it.The novel's strongest point is the characterization of the Joad family.

But Steinbeck has created such textured characters you know what has been left unsaid and have already filled in the blanks.I loved the character of Ma Joad and her simple philosophy of life. She swings from the heights of authority to the shadows of self doubt with such fluidity and simplicity that she reeks of reality, and personally I found Steinbeck's first description of her (on page 74 in the centennial edition) to be some of the finest character writing I have come across in a novel.Many readers are irritated by Steinbeck's overt socialism in the text, and I admit it is obnoxious at times, but I was not so bothered by it that I had to stop reading. I am not even sure that Steinbeck is extolling socialism as much as he is preaching the ""golden rule"". Rather, what I was more bothered by was his lazy characterization of people with money. If you are a banker, or a corporate farmer, or someone with money you are bad, period and nothing further need be said. Contrasted with the rich characterization he did with other characters (specifically the Joad family) I was annoyed by this lazy attempt at one dimensional characterization. It takes away from the humanity of all people, which I think is counter to one of the book's prevalent themes.""The Grapes of Wrath"" is an astounding text, and one that I found to be gripping and human. Despite some flaws it's themes of the resiliency of the human spirit and the strength to be found in family is needed and relevant. I was so wrapped up the in the last 150 pages of the text that I had to keep reading.

Peter Saccio has easily solved that problem with ""Shakespeare's English Kings"". This is a wonderful, erudite, concise, and easy to follow text that clears up the actual history behind Shakespeare's dramatizations. It also serves as an excellent guide to a period of English history that more and more people know less and less about.Mr. Saccio has written a book that does not read as an academic text, but instead reads as a colloquial history lesson. This makes it more accessible, and is a great strength of the text. Another plus is the book's organization. After an intro that explains necessary background and other details, the book is arranged by monarch, with each king's reign getting a chapter. The text is arranged in historical order, starting with the reign of Richard II, as it is this play which Shakespeare uses to start the history cycle. Saccio then takes the reader up through the end of the Plantagenet line (I actually know what that means now) with Richard III. He also devotes a chapter to the two Shakespeare history plays that do not fall into the chronology, ""King John"" and ""Henry VIII"". The chapters examine the history as we know it, the history as Shakespeare knew it through his sources, differences between the two, and how the Bard incorporated the history he does use into his works.Saccio himself tells the reader you can read the text all the way through as a coherent unified book (as I did) or you can read the chapter dealing with the play of Shakespeare's that you are interested in. He has written the book so that both approaches work.This book will aid you in a greater appreciation of Shakespeare's oft maligned history plays. However, it also is worthwhile as a standalone history of the English monarchy, especially in regards to the very confusing story of the ""War of the Roses"".

Then we get to Part Two and the book takes a fantastical and unexpected turn that many readers did not appreciate. Although I did not see the abrupt tone change in the text coming, it did not disturb me as much as it did other readers. Despite the ridiculous elements that Moore weaves into the book, beginning with Part Two, the novel works as a unit and hangs nicely in the balance between realism and crazy fantasy.Personally I loved the science and biological elements of the text. Moore researches avidly before writing his books and it shows in the plethora of interesting biological facts that he weaves into his tale. His adoration for research and aquatic life is obvious in this novel.One fantastical element that merits mention is Moore's creation of the ""whaley boys"". I won't spoil what that means, but I will say that they are among his more farfetched, and very funny, creations. And in the world of Christopher Moore that is saying something!The resolution of the novel is a little too tidy, but I wanted it to be, and I freely admit I would have been irritated had it not been so.

The greatest suc""Richard III"" boasts one of Shakespeare's most gleeful and charismatic creations in the character of the deformed Duke of Gloucester. The greatest success of this long play is the interaction between the reader/viewer and the title character. Richard is a horrid human being, but we are reading or watching the play because we are entranced by him and his villainy. It is a sobering thought, one that should horrify us, but we can't help ourselves. We are drawn to the bastard! I imagine Shakespeare loved his version of Richard because he endows him with such gleeful wit and debauched enjoyment in creating pain for others, that you are seduced by this worst of human beings. It almost borders on melodrama, but it never quite sinks to that level. The role of Richard III is Shakespeare's second longest, after Hamlet, and yet Richard is very rarely dull. Reading the scene where he and his henchman the Duke of Buckingham manipulate other nobles into supporting Richard's claim to the crown will bring a rueful smile to your face.I also enjoy the trio of queens in the play: Margaret the Lancastrian widow of Henry VI (who Richard killed), the Duchess of York (Richard's mom), and his brother's widow Queen Elizabeth. All three hate Richard with an intense passion, and all have blistering scenes of rage and rain curses on Richard at various times in the text. Detracting from the play is that these scenes and curses do get redundant, but there is no denying the ferocity and bile Shakespeare gave these women, and in the hands of talented actresses they would be a joy to watch.Many academics criticize ""Richard III"", for various reasons. I find most of them foolish. This play is not meant to be a historical recreation of the actual events (it isn't) nor is it some great lofty text. It is a glimpse into evil and ambition. Really it is just a more modern version of a morality play. Richard represents Vice and Ambition, and like most who let those traits govern their lives, he suffers the consequences.As for the Pelican Shakespeare series, they are my favorite editions as the scholarly research is usually top notch and the editions themselves look good as an aesthetic unit.

David Benioff has written an adventure story about friendship and war, but he does not try to gussy it up to be more than it is.

Not everyone can, or will choose to, do this. But sometimes it does happen, and when it does, it usually makes for a good story.Mr. Benioff is primarily a screenwriter, and it shows in the way he creates character and setting with just a few words or phrases.

An example of his awfulness (I could have chosen many) is a scene where a blind minister lectures someone about how now that he is blind he truly sees. Ugh. The book is full of this and many other hackneyed stock high school writing devices. But, I would be lying if I said that the book was not a page turner. It certainly is that.One strength of ""The Lost Symbol"" is that for most of the novel it does not try to take itself as seriously as the stupid ""DaVinci Code"", although the last 100 pages get way too didactic for my tastes. This text is also less antagonistic to the church and Christianity than Mr. Brown's previous two Robert Langdon novels.The villain of the piece leaves a lot to be desired, and his storyline is pure comic book, but if you put that aspect of it aside you can enjoy the ridiculousness of his villainy. Plus, there is a nice plot twist concerning the villain that I did not see coming, but yet if you go back and read a little closer Brown does a nice job of dropping subtle hints all along.Another quibble I have is that the book is about 100 pages too long because Brown gets very preachy and heavy handed with his Masonic lessons, and because he allows almost every character in the text to pontificate at some point or another about ancient wisdom, great secrets, etc. This leads me to my biggest issue with this, and other Dan Brown, novels. It is scary that some readers, and maybe even Mr. Brown himself, forget that this is fiction. Reading some of these s and various other materials on the text, there are many people out there who believe this crap about ancient hidden Masonic secrets, noetic science, hidden codes in the Bible, etc. Okay folks, it's cute, it's fun, it makes for good thriller reading, but it is not more than that.

Dorsey has always been a good creator of plots and an okay writer, but in this text the two skills come closer together than they have in his previous efforts.

It is a tricky device to pull off, but Dorsey does it, and it works in this piece.""The Stingray Shuffle"" is a little less violent than some of Dorsey's previous efforts, and he also wraps up the storyline about the 5 million dollars floating around south Florida in a briefcase (that has flowed through four of his other books) in this novel. Maybe that indicates that this particular plot device has been put to bed? I hope so, it was a good one, but it has run its course.Dorsey delivers his usual chuckles and guffaws in this text, and he has created a wonderful slapstick comedy group in the guise of some Russian mobsters.

When the advertised plot device is that a couple of yahoos accidentally kill the president as he is engaged in oral sex you know you are not reading a typical book. However, the text stretched the realm of possibility just too far for my tastes.

The cop is known only as ""Sarge"". Every conversation between the two brought a chuckle. The doormat of a protagonist, Jim Davenport, is also a nice Dorsey creation as he is the epitome of a good guy getting screwed everywhere he turns because he is so decent. In Dorsey's world of justice Mr. Davenport gets the rewards he richly deserves by novel's end, and those who have used and abused him also get theirs.Another highlight of the novel that merits mention is a college commencement speech that Serge delivers. It is found on pages 314-317 of the book, and it is nothing short of hilarious and brilliant. It is funny, but it also contains some very real truths about our world today.Oddly enough, this text is a celebration of neighborhoods and traditional family values. Serial killer Serge idolizes nuclear families and Jim Davenport because he knows how valuable what they do and provide is to a stable society. It is odd to get that message from a novel that focuses on a serial killer and his drug addled friends, but it is there none the less.Unlike many of the previous Dorsey novels featuring Serge A.

Personally, I always enjoy reading the wonderful scenes of Malvolio, a puritanical steward, and the drunk and somewhat malicious Sirs Toby Belch and Andrew Aguecheek. Shakespeare gives these three characters some of the best moments in the play, and it is also through them that all the subplots are brought together.Do not be fooled though, this play is not just crowd pleasing laughs. It is tinged with dark moments that remind the reader of the cruelties and vagaries of love, deception, and revenge.

There are some wonderfully great moments, and there are some ham-fisted personal political asides that T.H. White felt the need to insert into a powerful old legend. However, there are enough of the former for me to forgive the latter, and I am glad that I read ""The Once and Future King"".First to the novel's strengths, and there are many. The first strength of the novel is the character of Lancelot. He is by far the most fleshed out character in the text, and White creates as real a person as I have come across in literature. The reader knows Lancelot's mind and heart and White is able to give us access to this information in a manner that also pushes the story forward. Lancelot is a deeply realistic character, and most of the text's touching and truly human moments involve him.I also greatly enjoyed the style of ""The Once and Future King"". White writes the book in the voice of a modern person telling the story, perhaps to a child. As a result the persona of the storyteller creeps into the text once in a while, and inserts a modern reference or point. Although many readers dislike this device, I enjoyed it. It put me in the mood of the oral tradition and the importance that storytelling and myths have held over mankind since the beginning.This leads me to what I dislike about the work. Many of the modern references the persona interjects are very thinly disguised progressive ideological beliefs. To each his own, but can we keep modern politics out of an ancient legend? Please! Mr. White's personal indulgence in this regard cost him readers and admirers. That is a fit punishment.Another weakness is the character of Arthur. After ""The Sword in the Stone"", the first book in the quartet that comprises ""TOAFK"", Arthur quickly diminishes to little more than a philosophical medieval Hamlet. His dialogue gets didactic and self important and the reader can be forgiven for beginning to dislike this most noble of literary creations.""The Once and Future King"" also served as the inspiration for the musical ""Camelot"", but even if you are familiar with the musical, the book still deserves your attention. It is vastly superior and as with most adaptations, the musical leaves out many of the more pertinent and interesting aspects of the story.This is a nice and accessible version of the Arthurian legends.

The first act of this play frustrated me as reading no Shakespeare has done before. The play is his only comedy set in (Shakespeare's) modern day, and in England. As a result it abounds with archaic English colloquialisms and regionalisms that mean nothing to the modern American reader. You will have to look at the explanatory notes often while reading this play. The reader's frustration will be added to by the inclusion of a French character, complete with accent, a Welsh parson, also with accent, and a servant lady who speaks with malapropos and misunderstandings most of the time.If you can get over that hurdle, you will find the play picks up steam and humor in the last three acts, and there are some truly comic, and often vulgar, moments. The groundlings must have howled with delight at this play.Many critics hate this play because they say the Falstaff of ""Merry Wives' is a shadow of the character Shakespeare created for the Henry Four plays. He is. But I guess my question is, so what? Shakespeare created Falstaff and he can use him however he sees fit. To me it seems a minor quibble, and I am not sure I understand the passion it engenders in some people.Take ""The Merry Wives of Windsor"" for what it is, a lighthearted farce, meant as a diversion for its viewers, and leave all the academic baggage at home. You will be glad you did.As for the Pelican Shakespeare series, they are my favorite editions as the scholarly research is usually top notch and the editions themselves look good as an aesthetic unit. It looks and feels like a play and this compliments the text's contents admirably. The Pelican series was recently reedited and has the latest scholarship on Shakespeare and his time period. Well priced and well worth it....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Feb 01, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1427066.The_Merry_Wives_of_Windsor

However, it is not a very pleasant read. And that is not at all a bad thing.""Knockemstiff"" is Mr. Pollock's first published work, and in a couple of the stories I think it shows. They read like creative writing assignments done for class. In fact, in interviews Pollock has said some of them did in fact start out as assignments. However, despite a few missteps, there is no denying that he is a very talented writer. There are times when his prose is heartbreakingly real, and he is one of the best writers I have come across in a while who can create a very tangible sense of place. His version of the (real) town of Knockemstiff, Ohio leaps off of the page, and his descriptions of some of the poverty stricken, and disgusting, settings of some of the stories throb with a realistic fervor. No small feat.The stories focus on the dregs of society and are graphic in their depictions of sex, violence, and bodily functions. Not being able to get past these items and see the larger point of the story has caused many readers to dislike the text. That is understandable. However, if you look a little deeper, you will find that not every character in this book is an awful amoral piece of trash. Many of them don't know anything else, or have even the slightest clue or example about how to be better. There are moments where the characters scream out for human compassion, and when those moments happen in the book they are touching in their simplicity and truth. One story ends with a woman eating a box of doughnuts alone in her bed, and the knowledge that this is how she finds comfort in the world is a somber and unsettling thought.A couple of the stories seemed beyond redemption to me and the second piece in the book, ""Dynamite Hole"", is an awful story, both technically and thematically. However, that was the only part of the text I would have dropped had I been its editor.""Knockemstiff"" is a great piece of modern American fiction, but it is for a limited audience.

""Blue Latitudes"" gives credence to an oft overlooked titan of exploration and is also a humorous and informative modern journey to the places discovered and studied by Captain Cook on his three voyages. Horwitz's style in this text is the same as in previous works: part travelogue, part history. And like in previous efforts the formula works here too. Personally I love the integration of historical details, and what those historical elements have rendered in the modern era. Horwitz ably transitions between these facets of his book, and the reader can easily follow his changes and points of reference with no difficulty. Some ers have quibbled with Horwitz's flimsy connections of some elements of Cook's exploration with the dismal state of many of the places he explored today. While some of the connections may indeed be tenuous at best, I never felt that Mr. Horwitz was laying any blame at Cook's feet. In fact I think Horwitz wrote the book as a defense of Captain Cook and his exploits. He does not do what so many writers in the same vein do, namely project their political and moral judgments on people who lived hundreds of years ago. In these polarized times, I for one appreciated Mr. Horwitz's efforts to keep neutral, or to err on the side of caution and not pass harsh judgments on people who lived in a world vastly different from the one we inhabit today. ""Blue Latitudes"" is an enjoyable book, written by a wonderfully curious and intellectual man about another curious, courageous, and intellectual man who helped shape our modern world.

It allows the reader different perspectives, and allows the author to cover more ground with the ability to ""location hop"" with ease. When one is writing about war, this is a handy tool to have at one's disposal. When you are as uneven a writer as Mr. Shaara, it is a necessary one.""To The Last Man"" starts off with an engrossing chapter depicting a new English recruit arriving at the front lines in Belgium in 1915. It literally starts out with a bang and quickly draws the reader into the text, and the war. Most of the first third of the book is from the perspectives of Baron Ricthofen (later the Red Baron) and Raoul Lufbery an American pilot in the Lafayette Escadrille. I easily confess that I liked Mr. Shaara's focus on the aerial war for much of the novel. Other ers have been greatly bothered by it. He portrays aerial warfare, and its birthing pains as a means to make war, with skill and suspense and I sailed through the first part of the text. Occasionally he waxed a little too philosophic for my taste with the musings of Baron Richtofen, but I quickly forgave the flourish, and to Shaara's credit, I have vivid images of these two aviators in my head, and that is a result of his creation on the page.Unfortunately historical novelists are limited by history, and these two pilots did not survive the war. Upon their deaths Shaara all but abandons the aerial war, and the last part of the book is divided between American infantryman Roscoe Temple, and General ""Black Jack"" Pershing. The chapters from Temple's perspective are engaging war writing, and also informative, as the historical Temple had the unfortunate luck to be in the front lines at many of the big battles that the American troops participated in. However, Shaara focuses a lot of time on the behind the scenes maneuvering between the Allies, and the politics that are always a part of war. The bad news is that he has no skill doing this. He is out of his element, and it shows. His rendering of Pershing and the political and military leaders of the war are tone deaf and didactic. Shaara's Pershing does not talk, he pontificates, and as a result the reader quickly comes to loathe him. His inclusion in the novel seems only to me to make the point that the Allies would not have won without American intervention. With his tin ear for realistic dialogue anyway this was a dangerous ground for Shaara to explore, and I don't think he succeeded.Still, despite the characterization of Pershing, (and the grinding halt his chapters bring the novel to) and some historical inaccuracies in the novel's Afterward, I enjoyed the text. At times I really loved it.Mr. Shaara is a decent and prolific historical novelist, and I will continue to read his works....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,not set,"Feb 01, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/26175.To_the_Last_Man

I have mixed feelings about that message.The battle between being true to oneself and giving into societal expectations is identified here as the battle between one's mind and the ""Combine"" as personified by the ""Big Nurse"" Ratched. The action takes place in a mental institution where most of the patients have voluntarily committed themselves, a key but often overlooked plot point, somewhere in Oregon in the early 1960s. Keeping in mind the time period is an important consideration in enjoying this text, as the book is extremely misogynistic (only 1 minor female character is presented in a halfway decent light) and the ideas of nonconformity were a much bigger deal in 1962 then they are today. To take the novel out of its original context is to loose some of the enjoyment of reading it. Be careful to not judge it by today's standards.Ken Kesey was obviously a gifted writer, and he has some truly unique ways of crafting a text to resemble the scrambled mind of a person enduring electroshock therapy, and he was a clever user of figurative language. He was also gifted at crafting character, as the text has four (to my mind) that stand above and beyond the book they inhabit. The first is the novel's narrator, Chief Bromden, whose dry and insightful narration has the right mix of intelligence and self doubt to keep the reader on the edge of their toes. Another delightful and well rendered character is the mental ward patient Harding whose intelligence and wit serve as a nice foil to McMurphy's vulgarity and broad humor. Harding is a man who loathes what he truly is, and watching him mask that pain and self awareness is one of the most touching aspects of the novel. The ""hero"" and the ""villain"" of the piece, R. Patrick McMurphy and Nurse Ratched are nice personifications of abstract ideas and Kesey endows each with a depth and realism that is instantly recognizable to anyone who has paid even the remotest attention to human nature. The passive aggressive animosity and unhappiness inherent in Nurse Ratched is unnervingly real, and the chaos and self destructive behavior in McMurphy is equally impressive. The reason I think these two characters stand out to readers is because there are bits of both of them in most of us. The war between those two poles comprises not only the major conflict of this text, but also of many of our lives.There is a lot to digest in this book, and it will yield rewards on rereading it years later. Enter Kesey's world.

It appears that like his literary idol Mark Twain, Vonnegut became very disillusioned and hateful in his late life.

Vonnegut himself even said in earlier works that ""he never wrote heroes or villains"". He knew that judgment was best left to others. But this book is hateful towards those whose political or philosophical views differ from Vonnegut. It is like seeing a person that you greatly admired being exposed as a fraud. Vonnegut (in this book, which is nonfiction) is mean spirited, and all of the things he spent so much time earlier in his life begging us all not to be.Simply put, it makes me sad.I have now read this text twice, about three years apart, and I won't waste the time (with the exceptions mentioned above) again.

This is one of the best written character studies I have ever come across in my reading life. From the first page I was struck by the clarity and humanity of the writing, and the depth of reality that oozed from the characters as I kept turning the pages.I won't rehash plot points, but contrary to what some of these s say, there actually is a story here. We peek into the life of Pearl Tull from teenage years to death, and those people that her life encapsulates, mainly her three children. This is not a depressing text, or even an uplifting text. It defies such simple categorization. It is a book that examines life, and family, and how those two forces shape each other. As I was reading the novel I vacillated between hating and loving certain characters, mainly Pearl's oldest son Cody, but as the book continued I realized that there is always more to the story, and that none of the characters are really ""bad"" people so to speak. They all do very unlikable and even downright cruel things, but actions are rarely just what they appear on the surface to be. The shifting point of view between members of the Tull family aids the reader in seeing more than one side of the story. I kept thinking of Kurt Vonnegut as I was reading, and how he said he never wrote heroes and villains in his books. He meant we are oftentimes both, and ""Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant"" demonstrates that idea. Once I completed the novel I realized I loved the characters. You can only feel that emotion when the author has created a complex and rich reality. These characters are real...they are me and you and our brothers, and our mothers, and our fathers, etc. And it made me grateful for them, even though it is not always ideal or perfect, and often is the exact opposite, it is family and that is a gift. Having read this book twice now I find that each time I am absorbed in its world, absorbed with its people. Occasionally while reading I would find myself a little sad. Wistful and melancholy. Then suddenly, as often happens in real life, a moment of joy would spring up and I would find myself happy. That is a fundamental truth of life right there! This novel won't change your life, but it will enrich your appreciation of it.

This is a play that touches on the very essence of what it means to be human, and how our choices (or lack thereof) can make life feel like prison. Through a large ensemble cast Anton Chekhov gives us many different prisms to choose to view life through. The trick is that regardless of which ideology or prism you value, you still have to actually live your life. It does not just happen to you.The play revolves around the Prozorov home in provincial Russia late in the 1800s. In this house we see the lives of four siblings (a brother and the three sisters of the title) their in-laws and other relatives, soldiers, lovers, servants, and coworkers played out over a 4-5 year period. What is so astonishing to the reader is how static and stationary their lives seem to be, and yet when you reflect on your own life most of us will find the similarities unnerving, and possibly quite unpleasant. Chekhov seems to be saying that life is the everyday simple things that happen to us. What makes life either grand or mundane is how we react to everyday things. This is something that every self aware adult struggles with on their journey through this world.One could write entire papers about the philosophies of life and existence contained in this play. I won't attempt it here. I will simply say that this is a very powerful theatrical experience in the hands of a superior theatre company. It would be deadly dull in the hands of amateurs, so be careful where you view it. However, reading it on your own (or even better in a book club) will yield many pleasant discoveries about yourself and force you into some serious self reflection. Not bad things at all.A side note on the new version by actress/ writer Susan Coyne.

I don't feel it fair to compare him to other writers. For the other writer's sake!""Titus Andronicus"" is often maligned, and categorized as beneath Shakespeare. I find this to be stupid and insulting. This is an obvious early work and a work that was meant to please and entertain (gasp) the bloodthirsty Elizabethan crowds. This was an often produced play of Shakespeare's, and clearly established his reputation as a playwright in London.The plot of ""Titus"" barrels along at a very fast pace, and although it includes no great soliloquies, it does contain a wonderful example of Shakespeare's burgeoning prowess when Titus delivers a scathing address to his daughters rapists who are bound before him in Act V:2. One can imagine the excitement rippling through the audience at this most theatrical of stage moments.I think another great element of ""Titus"" is the shadings of future Shakespeare characters that we see throughout the text. In Titus' feigned madness I saw elements of Shakespeare's future King Lear. The villainous Aaron the Moor is clearly a precursor to Iago, and Tamora the Queen of the Goths could give Lady Macbeth a decent fight, and would be a juicy and fun role for any actress. Touchingly in the pained loyalty of the son of Titus, Lucius, we get a wounded portrait of a son's loyalty to a man who probably does not deserve it.In performance ""Titus Andronicus"" could be deadly in novice hands. But in the hands of a good company of actors, or as read by the comfort of your couch, I think this Shakespeare holds its own.As for the Pelican Shakespeare series, they are my favorite editions as the scholarly research is usually top notch and the editions themselves look good as an aesthetic unit. It looks and feels like a play and this compliments the text's contents admirably. The Pelican series was recently reedited and has the latest scholarship on Shakespeare and his time period. Well priced and well worth it....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Jan 23, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/116338.Titus_Andronicus

The great thing about Pat Conroy is that he sees and admits to this flaw in himself, and does it anyway. Take it or leave it. With that choice, I guess I'll take it.""My Reading Life"" is a collection of fifteen essays that almost serve as a mini memoir for Mr. Conroy. The book begins with two of the strongest essays in this text, and its ends with the other two strongest. Those bookends guarantee the reader a pleasurable experience. However, some of the middle essays I found a little lacking and the fault is not the writing. I was just not as interested in their content, and they seemed to lack the ""fire"" that Mr. Conroy insists is necessary for great writing. They were still quite good, and the text as a whole is necessary reading for serious writers.I know some readers have taken issue with the ""whininess"" of Mr. Conroy, and others have blasted his smugness. I actually think both of these qualities add to the text. One cannot read ""My Reading Life"" and not come away with the very real sense that Mr. Conroy is one of them. I could imagine myself living next to this guy, and I think some readers don't like their authors to be so ""human"". I for one am glad that he is.This is an enjoyable text, with some absolutely brilliant nuggets dispersed throughout. There are sentences about reading, and writing, and their value in our modern life that made me shake with their profundity and power. I also love the fact that Mr. Conroy is a forceful advocate for the ""story"" in literature and laments quite accurately about its demise in our postmodern age. His defense of this most ancient of arts (""tell me a story"") is something I cling to.

Don't get me wrong,The second novel in this trilogy about the people of GroVont WY is stronger than the first (highly praised) book, ""Skipped Parts"". Don't get me wrong, ""Skipped Parts"" was very good, but I think ""Sorrow Floats"" is a stronger text on many levels.Like many readers I was at first disappointed that the narrator for ""Sorrow Floats"" was not Sam Callahan, as I was expecting, but rather one of my least favorite characters from ""Skipped Parts"", Maurey Pierce. However, I should not have doubted Tim Sandlin's amazing ability to create a convincing and winning narrative voice. Having read four of his novels now I should know this, but each time it impresses me more and more. How a middle aged man gets in the mind and heart of a 23 year old female alcoholic is beyond me, but I feel strongly that Mr. Sandlin achieves the task. Maurey's winsome observations of those around her, and her wry observations (sometimes brutal) about herself ring with truth. Like all of his texts, a major strength of this novel is the persona and narrative voice Sandlin creates. It should be expected of him by now.This novel also boasts an interesting supporting cast of characters, but I actually found the misfits in this novel likable, and I did not care for them (as personalities) in ""Skipped Parts"". Sandlin seems to endow all of them with tenderness, some more rough edged than others, which made them members of humanity that you rooted for.The novel is sentimental, and there is a death scene in it straight out of everyone's fantasy of what a death of a loved one should be like. It rarely goes that way in reality, but during this saccharine scene I found myself teary eyed at the beauty of the possibility of this scene from a novel being a reality for people. The tenderness of the novel's final chapters, along with the reader's innate desire for the real world to be just like that did not make them seem trite to me, as others have suggested. Rather, it made them hopeful. I like hope. I need hope. And I think the world does too.Enjoy, and recommend Mr. Sandlin to every reader you know.

The reason was not because I did not know how it ends. That is hinted at almost from the beginning. It was not because I have a personal connection to Franklin County, VA or moonshining in particular. It was because Matt Bondurant has created a novel where the characters literally breathe and the reader finds themselves caught up, and invested in, the details of their lives.I would have given this text five stars but for two things. The novel is full of a few too many literary pretensions, not using quotation marks being one, and I also did not care for the frame story involving the writer Sherwood Anderson. Mr. Bondurant has a PhD, and I half bet his dissertation was on Anderson. Although that frame was well written, and had some interesting elements, it detracted from the more important part of the novel, and based on s I have read on Amazon, confused a lot of readers. I for one did not find his literary tricks and the subplot involving Anderson confusing, I just did not care for them.However, I think this is a novel of surprising depth, and wonderful characterization. Mr. Bondurant has succeeded powerfully in crafting three memorable, and three dimensional, characters in the Bondurant brothers: Forrest, Jack, and Howard. My book club read this text, and everyone agreed that the characterization was one of the strongest aspects of the novel. Mr. Bondurant has done something that is hard to do. He has taken people who, if we knew them in real life, most of us would not want to be associated with and made their humanity so overwhelming that we see ourselves in them. This should be the aim of every good writer, and in this novel he meets that goal.Despite what many think, this is a novel that begs rereading and discussion. There is much more depth than meets the eye and the careful reader will find some powerful motifs and moments in this text. The character of Jack (the author's grandfather) is one such example. Throughout the text Jack struggles to articulate the world as he sees it in his mind. He has beautiful and profound observations, but like many men I know, he cannot articulate them in a manner that others can relate to. Seeing the interactions between him and his oldest brother Howard (who sees this in Jack and responds to it in his own quiet way) is one of the most touching things I have come across in a book.The harsh reality of everyday life is powerfully brought home in the text, and once you finish it be prepared to feel like a big wimp. Our grandparents and great grandparents had hard lives. They had real problems. The powerful evocation of time and place in this novel easily demonstrates that!I will read this book again.

I was hoping for something along the lines of her lovely ""Assassination Vacation"" which does not try to pass itself off as serious historical study, and instead I got pseudo history. Although Vowell is to be applauded for investigating a period of history that Americans know too little about (the Massachusetts Bay Colony, etc.) she inserts herself into the text way too much for it to be an effective and honest study of that time and those people.The first error Ms. Vowell makes is to judge people from the 1630s by 21st century standards. For one, it is junk historical investigation, and two, it is also unfair. The world is very different now than it was then, and to hold people responsible for our current mores and values is unfair and more than a little arrogant. Arrogance, ironically, is something she has a huge problem with in our Puritan forbearers. But not in us apparently.Another frustration with the book is her constant insertion of lame humor and liberal politics. Neither adds to the text. I don't begrudge Ms. Vowell any of those things, but please write a book that goes with those choices. She tries to have her cake and eat it too, and you can't. Write a historical study, or write a historical overview through our modern prism. But, don't pretend you can successfully do both together in one volume.I usually tear though Vowell's works.

I think most of us would not want to be associated with many of the characters in the book in real life, but within the confines of the printed page Tim Sandlin has created real people that we root for, laugh at, and who make us shake our heads in disgust. In short, the characters are real.The title ""Skipped Parts"" can be taken so many ways, but while most readers think the title refers to the teenage sex in the novel, and the way that sex is treated in society, I think it also refers to the skipped parts of society at large. By that I mean the places and people that lots of Americans would rather pretend were not there. I also think it refers to the book's setting; GroVont WY, a place that many coastal Americans just skip over when they take into account American values and mores. If it is not California or New York it does not count, etc.The realistic portrayal of the characters is jarring especially considering how morally deficient some of them are, and I think that is the point. We are all struggling in this life. Some succeed better than others, and many just get by, in a spiritual and physical sense. I am not especially fond of the protagonist's mom, Lydia, or his best friend/ sex partner (Maurey) but I understand and know them.

Now, 10 years later I have read it half a dozen times, and find it to be a richer and richer experience every time.Fitzgerald was a talented writer, and there are times that the prose in this text is breathtakingly good. But that is not what makes this novel stand out as one of the greatest pieces of truly American literature. Rather it is the eternal optimism, sometimes misplaced, of Gatsby (and some of the other characters) that keeps calling to the reader long after the last page. Fitzgerald wrote a book that speaks to the American ideals and persona, and he did it in the guise of a love story. There is no better description of the indefatigable American spirit than the last page of this novel. It is literary perfection, and even if the book that preceded it was not incredible it would be worth the price.I won't rehash plot points here, but I will say that in Gatsby, Daisy, Jordan Baker, and the amazingly well drawn Tom Buchanan, Fitzgerald created a cast of characters that will long reign as one of the most recognizable in the canon of American Lit. I recently reread this novel for a book club, and it is no coincidence that despite the many varied reactions to the book, everyone agreed that Tom stood out. We all knew a Tom in our lives. It speaks to Fitzgerald's honesty as a writer that one of the least likable characters in the text is one of the novel's standouts.Don't read ""The Great Gatsby"" because you have to.

And then something happened; I got use to Ms. Mantel's writing style, and my knowledge of history kicked in and I was swept up in the story. In that sense, ""Wolf Hall"" is a lot like reading Shakespeare. It takes a minute to get use to the style and language, and previous knowledge of the characters and their relationships is a plus, and then it is a very enjoyable experience.I would not read this novel if...-you don't enjoy history, specifically the Tudor period in England.-you don't want to devote some serious reading time to this text. It is not a novel you can put down and come back to a week later. It is too intricately plotted and populated for that.If the above does not describe you I would encourage your picking up this 604 page tome. Despite its length, it is a quick and engaging read and I found myself immersed in it for a long time at each sitting. Another pleasure of the novel was in how Mantel slowly unravels the intricacies of the history of the period for the close reader. About 200 pages in I suddenly had a eureka moment and understood the title. Such little pleasures make the text even more enjoyable. There are many such moments in the book, where the reader suddenly sees what later event Mantel is setting up in the plot. A clever and subtle genius, that adds greatly to her novel. Often I found myself going to the web to read further about some topic Mantel brings up the text. A great site for such info is tudorhistory.org. Checking those references made the immersion in the novel all the more fuller for me.The novel's protagonist is the much maligned in history Thomas Cromwell, who was one of the most influential men in English history. He is usually forgotten in the miasma of Henry VIII, Anne Boleyn, Cardinal Wolsey, Thomas More, etc. But historically Cromwell was the center of the storm that these folks swirled around. Most of the novel is told from his perspective and we often find ourselves inside his head, privy to his observations and thoughts. As has been mentioned numerous times, this is the source of confusion for some readers, as Mantel is vague with pronoun usage, but it is deliberate on her part. She is recreating the speech patterns and writing style of the period.Another bonus of the text is that surprisingly, the novel is often very funny, as Mantel endows Cromwell with a very dry and bitter wit.This is an episodic novel, and not an easy read.

The prose is economical, and there are rarely more words used then are needed.

But, if you get on board with Mr. Dickey's style you will enjoy the ride.Some have said that the characters are not fleshed out, but I disagree.

Rarely have I read a book where the physical actions of the characters were etched into my mind and my body responded with the sense memory. This novel does that. Dickey has made the physical battle for survival as real as I have come across in literature.Besides the survival element of the book, ""Deliverance"" also deals with the philosophical question of what makes us human and civilized.

People like him, know him, enjoy his other work, etc. All that is fine, buts let's be honest...a good writer he ain't.One thing I liked in the text, that I can see some folks hating, is the idea of the book as a therapist ordered journal, written by the narrator. It therefore reads in character voice with all the inherent colloquialisms, etc. However, the narrator is stereotypical and clichéd, and detracts from what little impact the text could have.The dénouement and ending of the book are straight out of a gay after school special about Broadway, and I for one don't like to see people reduced to simplistic caricatures.The novel is easy, light, and fun reading; I just would not buy it. Borrow it from a library. By the way, if you don't have an avid interest in musical theatre you will hate it.

I ended up giving it 5 due to its novel approach to its subject, and the amount of research involved. However as a text that consistently keeps your interest it is a 4, because I often found myself a little bored, and wishing for the author to get to his next subject.This text is not a biography of Shakespeare. Rather it is a historical exploration of the year 1599, and the culture of Elizabethan England, and how those aspects of his life and times informed the four plays that Shakespeare probably wrote in that pivotal year in his career. This is a unique and solid way to approach Shakespeare and Mr. Shapiro is certainly well researched and insightful in his observations. This book made me think of many things in Shakespeare in a new way, and that is a great testament to its scope and depth. Mr. Shapiro is very strong in his analysis of how the political and cultural situation in England in 1599 informed Shakespeare's writing of ""Henry V"", ""As You Like it"", and ""Hamlet"". However, he has to reach a little to find much cultural context that is specific to 1599 for ""Julius Caesar"". Still, the points that he makes about how life in Elizabethan England relate to this Roman story are insightful, and certainly worth exploring.If you want a text that is in the vein of biographies of Shakespeare, such as ""Will in the World"", etc I don't think you will like this book. It is a little more History and England than it is Shakespeare, and if you are not a fan of History, and specifically that period, you will not enjoy this read. There are some times where the literary history that Shapiro explores will bore the casual reader.A different type of text to add to the library of writing on Shakespeare, but a welcome one!...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Jan 23, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8862.A_Year_in_the_Life_of_William_Shakespeare

Unlike most of ""The Tempest"" is Shakespeare's last great play, and in an oddly appropriate way it is very different from much of his earlier efforts. Unlike most of Shakespeare's work, ""The Tempest"" seems to have come mostly from the Bard's own mind, and does not have source materials from which Shakespeare lifted the plot. This may explain the weakness of the plot of the play, regardless it does not matter in the big scheme of things.The play takes the form of following three separate groups on an enchanted isle. A group of foul noblemen, who gained power through the usurpation of the rightful ruler, a comic trio who stumble about in drunkenness and plot evil deeds (the play's comic relief) and the ""lord"" of the island (Prospero) and his faithful spirit world servants. When the three plots converge in the final act of the text Shakespeare gives the reader a satisfying conclusion, but one that still has a hint of sadness and darkness to it. The famous epilogue of the play spoken by Prospero (Now my charms are all o'erthrown...) leaves the reader with a plethora of questions and emotions. This epilogue is one of the most beautiful pieces in the entire canon.It has become fashionable to make ""The Tempest"" a valedictory play for Shakespeare, and there are many moments in the text that can be read as Prospero speaking for him. At the play's conclusion Prospero frees his trusty servant Ariel (some say his muse), acknowledges the half human Caliban as ""mine own"" (some say his own dark nature) and gives up his magic powers (his talent). This is an appropriate reading, and a satisfying one for lovers of Shakespeare. Just be careful not to limit the text to just that interpretation.I think the greater strength in the piece is its portrayal of the absolute humanity of forgiveness, and how lucky we as humans are to be able to practice it. The most poignant scene in Shakespeare begins at the beginning of Act V when Ariel tells Prospero that he would be moved to pity for the people that Prospero has entrapped on the island (with the plan of taking revenge) ""were I human"". This stunning declaration causes Prospero to recant his vengeful purposes, ""the rarer action is in virtue than in vengeance."" A grown up Shakespeare has lived a life and seen the capacity for good that humanity can engender. It is hard to imagine the man who wrote ""The Tempest"" as the same man who wrote the revenge blood fest ""Titus Andronicus"" so many years earlier.

It is peopled with real characters that leap of the page in all of their complexity, it is a fervent convert's exuberant praise to his recently realized God, it is a glimpse of the fading aristocracy of England, and it is a story of a few people and their journey to find their faith and proper place in the world.This book is vastly different from Waugh's satirical earlier works. There is still satire and humor in this text, but it is dryer and less central to the plot than in some of his previous novels. Also, unlike his previous efforts the characters in this novel are not caricature, but well developed human individuals. It is also rather episodic in plot and we follow the characters from their late teens to early thirties, a rather formative time in one's life. I think that reading this novel will be a fuller experience if the reader has a religious background, and some personal experience with faith. But it is not necessary to enjoying (and getting something) from the text.The novel deals with a close circle of friends, and depicts how they all in their own ways come to God. I feel that Mr. Waugh was trying to write a great novel of faith (my personal opinion) and to that extent I think he left religion, and the Catholic Church in particular, open to some criticism, which I don't think was his intent. However, one could read the same sections that I think expose the weakness of the church, and see them as plot details that strengthen the argument for faith. Waugh was much smarter than I, and I am going to assume that was his goal. What makes the text so layered is that one can read the novel and see a great testament to God and Church, and others can read it and just as easily argue for the destructive power of religion on individuals. To me, that is one of the greatest assets of ""Brideshead Revisited"".This novel got under my skin, in a good way, and has been knocking around in my head since I finished. To me, that is high praise. I will be revisiting this text again.

This is a text where no single character dominates, and many have more than one brilliant moment.The play follows the jealously inspired downfall, and eventually redemption, of King Leontes.

This text is the result of a writer at the top of his game, and the episodic plot (it takes place over 16 years) allows the Bard to weave in many varying themes that lead to a pleasing and satisfying conclusion.This text is often maligned as not one of Shakespeare's better efforts, and I wholeheartedly disagree.

This is all the more noteworthy when one considers that Mr. Chafets is not a conservative predisposed to like Rush. This author is something new in the cadre of those who write about the political world, an intellectually honest writer. Mr. Chafets does not have to agree with Rush to admire his talent and admit his importance to the world of conservatism. In fact, some of Mr. Chafets harshest words are for those who blindly criticize, or lie, about Rush and his beliefs. He may agree with some of their politics, but their weak tactics he finds disgusting. A liberal writes an honest (and thus admiring) book about Rush Limbaugh. Will wonders ever cease? I only catch Rush if I happen to be in the car at the time he is on the air, so I don't know tons about him. Therefore the biography parts of this text (which is not much of it) did not impart to me information I already knew, which was a complaint of some other ers of this work. In fact, actual biography of Rush is a marginal part of this book, as Chafets wisely focuses much of the text on Rush's importance to the conservative, entertainment, and radio arenas. He is a giant in all three and Chafets gives an unflinching analysis of why that is the case. There is also quite a bit of time expanded on Rush and the Obama presidency and the obsession that administration seems to have with him. It is when Mr. Chafets examines these aspects of Rush and his legacy that the book really picks up. I for one was dulled by the early chapters of this text that deal with Rush's childhood and rise. You can tell Chafets is weaker in the area of biography, as his writing is lackluster in those sections. But when he gets to politics and media, Chafets is in his forte and the writing shines.Mr. Chafets is not a Rush Limbaugh sycophant, and he does not shy away from Limbaugh's mistakes and flaws. He just does not crucify Limbaugh for them. He knows we all have done things we would rather not be remembered.

The plot follows politics this time, and a race for governor of Florida. As a result, this book is less violent than Dorsey's previous two, and a little less funny. In fact, that is why I think it is my favorite read (thus far) of Dorsey's work. I was on my way to giving this text 4 stars, but decided not to, for reasons I will mention below.You can tell that Dorsey is uneasy in the realms of satire, as he is not consistently successful with his attempts at it in this text. Most of the characters have very obvious names (Gomer Tatum, Escrow, etc.) and I don't need the author telling me the obvious about a character; I need him to show me. This aspect of this book I could do without. I also wish Dorsey had rewritten the last 20 pages or so of text, as they detract from the novel. They include a WWF match between serious candidates for governor, and a billionaire driving around in a 1930's vehicle trying to kill the Governor. No thanks. The books are ridiculous enough (in a good way) without getting stupid.Highlights of the text include a spot on satire of old gumshoe detective stories in the character of a roving detective who pops into the text from time to time for brief comedic interludes. Personally, I loved it when Detective Mahoney showed up and I hope he appears in other Dorsey texts.

The descriptions of the characters are pretty typical, almost stock representations, and the plot is not unfathomable. The novel simply is not as funny as previous Hiaasen efforts, and the author inserts too much of his political biases into the story.

That is how I would summarize ""Hammerhead Ranch Motel"". In his second novel Tim Dorsey writes at a dizzying pace that introduces a ton of characters, and even more plot twists. And for a beach read, it works.I continue to be amazed at how Dorsey manages to stay on top of a convoluted and intertwined plotline. He is truly skilled at bringing his many subplots together in a climactic scene, that in some twisted manner, makes sense. At least in the world of the novel. For that reason I would not recommend reading this text over an extended period of time because the multitude of subplots and characters do actually come together, and if you read over a protracted period you will forget many of them.Dorsey also does a nice job of creating a standalone novel, even though ""Hammerhead"" follows immediately after its predecessor, Dorsey's debut novel ""Florida Roadkill"". You can read, and enjoy, ""Hammerhead"" without having read ""Roadkill"", although I would not recommend it.Mr. Dorsey is often compared to Christopher Moore and Carl Hiaasen, but I don't think that is a fair comparison. They are different writers, with very different styles. Dorsey's books are far more violent (and at times that disturbs me, but it is what it is) and he has a very twisted and very clever way of using figurative language. Some of the funniest, and most vulgar, similes I have ever come across!Enjoy the stay at the ""Hammerhead Ranch Motel""....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Jan 23, 2016",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/435867.Hammerhead_Ranch_Motel

Plotting weaknesses and anachronisms detraOne of Shakespeare's earliest plays, ""The Two Gentlemen of Verona"" reflects the novice playwright's skills. Plotting weaknesses and anachronisms detract from the play. Still, there is a lot to love about this piece.One of the play's greatest strengths is the character of Launce. He is one of the funniest clowns that I have read in Shakespeare, and the two monologues Shakespeare gives him are not only laugh out loud funny, and incredibly witty, they also have very touching and human elements. In performance this character would steal the show.Being a young man when he wrote ""Two Gentlemen"" it is no wonder that the focus of the text is friendship between two young men, and how romance changes friendships. I wish Shakespeare had explored this theme more, but he does some decent things with it here through the characters of Proteus and Valentine (the gentlemen of the title). Proteus is a real piece of work and I don't understand why Valentine loves this man, but such is the nature of friendship and love. It rarely makes sense to observers of it.A major weakness of the play is the ridiculously tidy and very quick ending in Act 5:4. Valentine catches his friend betraying him, and threatening rape of his betrothed, and he forgives him in less then a minute. Obviously unbelievable! The two main female characters (Silvia and Julia) are also underdeveloped, and frankly not that interesting. I imagine it would be quite hard for an actress to make them compelling, especially if she was playing Julia.Still, ""Two Gentlemen"" is a delightful read and I am anxious to see it performed. It would be a fun evening. In giving this play 3 stars, I am comparing it against Shakespeare's other work, not against any other writer.As for the Pelican Shakespeare series, they are my favorite editions as the scholarly research is usually top notch and the editions themselves look good as an aesthetic unit. It looks and feel like a play and this compliments the text's contents admirably. The Pelican series was recently reedited and has the latest scholarship on Shakespeare and his time period.

A novel that deals with a gay couple who ""inherits"" a flamboyant child can easily drift into caricature, or cloying cuteness, and ""Breakfast with Scot"" does neither. That is to Mr. Downing's credit.There is some beautiful prose in this novel, and some wonderful moments where Mr. Downing, through his narrator Ed, makes some profound sentiments about life and love. The novel creeps up on you, and you find things don't turn out as expected, and gosh, isn't life just like that also? There are no big climatic moments, or profound momentous occasions, the characters just find that they and their circumstances have changed. The crux of the novel is how they choose to deal with those changes in circumstance. That is such stuff as life is made of.

Moore, through subtle characterization, demonstrates that Abby is a girl growing up and has a whole lot more to her than meets the eye. The subtext of her character was very enjoyable to me.The plot goes everywhere, but the read is satisfying, and Moore ties the trilogy up in a way that will please most of his audience.I don't think this series is Moore's best work, but they are an enjoyable lot.

I enjoyed ""Bloodsucking Fiends"" (see my posted ) and found upon rereading that I did remember some parts of it from years ago. Having finished ""You Suck"" I found I remembered nothing, and here is why. There is nothing to remember. The plot for this text is almost nonexistent, and the characterizations fall mostly flat.

A nice way to spend a lazy evening, but not really satisfying.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this novel, but there is nothing to it. It is a quick read; I laughed a few times, and went along for the ride. But one of my favorite Moore traits from his earlier work was that the stories were surreal, cleaver, well written, nicely plotted, and at times even poignant. This text is rarely any of those things. I was also irritated by the frequent typos, and Moore got some details wrong from the first novel, and the anachronisms bothered me. Maybe they were cleared up in later printings?Its strength is the new character of Abby Normal, and her journal entries are a highlight. They are not too long, and appear at an appropriate frequency in the text. Abby's voice is authentic, and very funny, and she seems like the only character that Moore tried to develop. Maybe she seems that way because she is placed alongside the other cardboard cutouts in the novel, but regardless, I enjoyed her.I like Christopher Moore; I have read and bought everything he has written.

Moore is up to his usual tricks in this text, and the cast of characters include such Moore favorites as Inspector Rivera and the Emperor of San Francisco.

Tying together sub plots in unexpected, and appropriate, ways seems to be a Moore specialty.One of the treasures of this text is that despite the outlandish twists, characters, vulgarity, etc. Moore still makes serious points about our humanity and this is one of the novel's unexpected pleasures. One does not expect to be reading a chapter where vampires have crazy good sex, and then read an astute observation about love, or the nature of loneliness.

Because the late forties, early fifties is a time period all but ignored in most public school History classes I was ignorant of many aspects of the Truman presidency, and certainly about his life in general. This tome has cleared up that problem for me!McCullough is obviously a good writer and researcher, one cannot dispute those facts. He is also clearly enamored of his subject, and at times this makes him less critical then perhaps the situation warrants. But the moments where the author's bias detracts from the text are very few and far between. McCullough certainly does not shy away from some of the less desirable aspects of Truman's (and his associates') characters. Thus, that criticism of this text is unfair.The first 200 or so pages are the least interesting of the text, but that is mainly because they are about Truman's uninspired and uninteresting first 30 years of life. Harry S. Truman was a late bloomer! Then the text picks up as Truman starts a family and embarks on a political career. When he is nominated for vice president, the book kicks into high gear. The years of the Truman presidency were some of the most important in the twentieth century and McCullough gives great attention to events such as the conference at Potsdam, dropping the atomic bombs, the Marshall Plan, the beginnings of the Cold War, Truman's exciting reelection, etc.Yet another strength of the text is the cast of characters assembled around Truman. McCullough fleshes out their personalities and lives and at times I felt I was as immersed as Truman must have been in his own life. Names from history books now have personalities and other aspects of humanity attached to them, and thus History takes on a whole new dimension.It is rare that I will sit and read a work of nonfiction for uninterrupted hours at a time, but I found myself doing this numerous times with this text. McCullough knows, and proves, that History at its best is very exciting. This is a biography worthy of its subject. Truman's life incorporated period of immense change in the world (think about what happened from 1884-1972) and this text does an admirable job of catching the spirit and consequences of that rapidly evolving time.Highly recommended!...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,not set,"Jan 23, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2279.Truman

Although not my personal choice for favorite genre, science fiction can be quite good and “Ender’s Game” is a clever book and a notch above much of the science fiction I have read before.First off, for a book that is considered “young adult” I thought it got a little heady and philosophical at times. I wonder how those sections read to teenagers? Regardless, it kept my attention and most young adult fiction does not.Orson Scott Card does a nice job of getting inside his protagonist’s (Ender Wiggins) head. He comes across as a real kid, and in a science fiction novel that feeling of reality is key in order for the book to feel plausible.Without spoiling the text, there was one element of the novel that was starting to irritate me, and then with about 30 pages to go I suddenly realized a potential twist the story could take. Two pages later I was proven correct. It is a clever plot point Mr. Card used. I felt a little dim for having not noticed it sooner.The last 60 or so pages of the book are quite good and I really enjoyed the concept of the “Speaker of the Dead”. It is an interesting idea. I also appreciated Card’s willingness to address what war does to those who fight it. No humane person can kill (even in justified causes) and not feel something.“Ender’s Game” is a novel I unexpectedly enjoyed, mainly because of the strength of the characterization and the fact that it kept surprising me. It kept going places I was not expecting it to go. I don’t know that I will read the rest of the “Ender” series, but this novel is a good one....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Jan 22, 2016","Feb 21, 2016","Jan 22, 2016",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/375802.Ender_s_Game

Mr. Conroy has created as realistic a portrait of young adult companionship and comradely as I have found, to date, in literature. This long novel has many themes and characters, but the text is really about its narrator, Will McLean, and his years at a military college, known as ""the Institute.""The strengths of the book are many, but here are a few that come quickly to mind. The voice of its protagonist, Will, is one of the novel's most enjoyable features. Will is articulate, sarcastic, and funny as hell. He is also inwardly shy, unsure of his place at the Institute, in his own circle of friends and relationships, and a man capable of great decency and gross baseness. In short, Will is a boy learning how to become a man. Like all of us, it is Will's interior life that is the most honest and interesting, and it is his moments of introspection where the novel really achieves greatness. However, Conroy has interwoven this high literature with one of the best suspense stories I have seen in recent years. I could not stop reading once I hit the last 150 pages. The novel propelled me along to its conclusion. I had to keep reading, even when at times I did not like what was happening in the text.Another profound element in the novel is Conroy's evocation of Charleston SC. After Will, Charleston is the most developed character in the text, and it is easy to feel and see the city that plays such an important part in the lives of the characters.Every once in a while I found Conroy's prose to be flowery to no real purpose, but it doesn't detract that much from the novel, and at times it was breathtakingly beautiful. Another weakness was that the ending lines of the book are straight out of a clichéd film. But it was what the reader wanted, and needed, as a conclusion for this intense novel.When I left the world this novel created I missed it characters. I think about them, I find myself revisiting them.

To Mr. Hornby's great credit, this novel is neither! Nick Hornby tackles the dark subject of suicide with tenderness, comedy, and even sympathy in this interesting novel. He approaches it honestly, and one of the novel's greatest strengths is that the ending is not a nicely tied up movie plot finale. Many of the issues that drove the four central characters to consider taking their lives have not gotten better, some have even gotten worse, but what has changed is that the characters realize life is what it is. You either take it on its terms, or you get out.Of the four central characters, two are immensely unlikable, but the characters of Maureen and JJ have sincerity to them that I enjoyed. The novel is written from the first person perspective of the four protagonists, and each has a distinct voice and style. The story is told chronologically, with each chapter alternating the first person point of view. Hornby does not fall prey to the usual traits of alternating first person novels. The story progresses with each chapter. We don't get every person's version of the same events, we get a progressing story, with each character picking up and moving the plot points forward.Life does not come to a halt because things get rough.

""A Voyage Long and Strange"" is not as good as his past efforts, but it is a delightful and informative read none the less.I guess my education was not as bad as the ones lamented by Horwitz in this text because I had a passing familiarity with most of the explorers, conquistadors, etc. that he mentioned. Still, Horwitz developed those stories on a human level, and I enjoyed his exploration of how those long ago expeditions and voyages shape this nation to this very day.A strength of the book is that Horwitz gives credit where credit is due, and does not paint all the conquistadors and explorers as men who raped and pillaged exclusively. He gives them as fair a shake as can be expected in our sensitive modern world, while not glossing over their cruelties and flaws. The people in the past were like us, good and bad mixed together, and Horwitz seems to keep away from the postmodern tenet of judging people by our time and standards.Another great strength of the text is his interviews and adventures with the modern inhabitants of the places that were the quest of the explorers he examines.Love them or hate them, names like Columbus, DeSoto, DeVaca, Coronado, Smith, etc. are names that anyone who wants a real understanding of America's history should be familiar with.

Vonnegut tackles several possible thematic tracks half heartedly throughout the novel. These range from digressions on the relationship of the creator and his creation, the intrusion of an authorial persona throughout the text, and the nature of free will. Vonnegut also hearkens back to earlier gems such as the importance of minor life and details, the inequalities of capitalism, etc. And at times, he delivers some biting satire and thought provoking lines (and even paragraphs) on these topics. But alas, that is all he delivers. An occasional spark does not a fire make, and a witty or interesting point scattered here or there does not a novel make.This novel lacks cohesion...and that was Vonnegut's goal. I get it.

I think it suffers from overly effusive praise and so many readers are bitterly disappointed once they get through it.First, let's look at the strengths of the novel. I enjoyed the evocations of circus and train life. Gruen clearly spent some time working on these descriptions of circus life and there are little Depression era details that were nice historical jewels for the reader to mine. Also effective was her characterization of old Jacob. His voice was witty and biting and he provided the most pleasure of any character in the text. Chapter nineteen of the novel is the saddest depiction of rest home life I have read in literature. A man is forgotten by his family, and the scene is heartbreaking.Now to examine the reasons why this book is unsatisfying. First off the characters from the 1930s parts of the novel are some of the weakest characterizations I have seen in a book in a long time. They are stock characters at best, and the villains are the mustache twirling men from melodrama. It is hard to care about any of the characters because they are so transparently fake. Even more distracting then the weak characterization is the incredibly insipid (and modern sounding) dialogue Gruen puts in their mouths. She has such nice historical details in the setting of the text, why couldn't she also use it in the dialogue?Many readers have found the ending unsatisfying, and although it is ridiculous, it fits the novel so I won't argue with it. The cloying depiction of animals is also a little beyond the pale, but again, I simply had to come to terms with the novel for what it is. It is popular fiction. It is a melodrama you will get caught up in. And for those purposes it is adequate. Don't go into it expecting more than what it is capable of giving and you will be satisfied....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,not set,"Jan 22, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/43641.Water_for_Elephants

There are some genuinely laugh out loud moments in this book, and all of the characters are likable in their quirky ways. I especially enjoyed Keillor's tender rendering of the protagonist's marriage and his irrepressible love for a wife that he adores, but does not always know how to treat.The moral, such as it is, is that we all bear a little responsibility for kindness in this world, and the Christmas season is a very appropriate time to recognize and make new resolutions in that regard.

Are we merely going through the motions of life, or do we control our destinies? What are our obligations to our fellow humans? Is there any great design to the universe and our lives? There is nothing new in those questions, but the way that Mr. Vonnegut examines these questions is still unique and relevant, decades after this novel's first publication.The novel's protagonist is Billy Pilgrim, whose metaphorical name gives insight into his journey. Billy Pilgrim goes through life; he does not participate in it. Billy believes that all action is preordained, and thus he lets life happen to him. Yet despite this pathetic choice, Billy is an everyman worth rooting for. He is content with his lot, even if we the readers are not content with his passivity.Like the best novels, S5 lets the reader choose what the right thing is, and allows more than one side to every issue. Vonnegut has managed to write a book about war, human nature, natural selection, religious belief, death, history, and the value of choice in one's life. He tackles these plethora of themes in a novel that encapsulates time travel, aliens, WW II, and the humdrum of middle class life. Now that is a feat.And the greatest thing about this novel is that every read yields new insights and lessons. Its themes are vast, and its pleasures continue to grow.

The world of life on the road surrounded by the misfits and rejects of society is something most of us don't have firsthand knowledge of, but Ms. Dunn creates an atmosphere so rich that even the most unrealistic aspects of this novel seem breathtakingly alive.The major strength of the novel is the Binewski family at its core. Dunn lovingly crafts these characters and although each and every one of them has huge faults and disgusting traits, they are unfaltering in their realism. The basic human desire to be loved and needed takes on many forms, and many of them are not pleasant. Some readers may find themselves repulsed by actions of the Binewski characters, not realizing due to the characters distracting physical deformities, that they may in fact do the same things. Dunn did this on purpose, and the punch in the gut for the reader is a hard one.Yet another strength of the text is Dunn's prose. The voices of the characters are established early and each is artfully developed as the novel progresses. Dunn's use of figurative language is inventive and she has the power of the imaginative phrase in a vein that reminds me of Tom Robbins.The weakness of this novel is the ending and the ultimately disappointing sub plot (told in the present tense) that weakens the novel and leaves the reader wishing to return to the main plotline involving the Binewski family and their topsy turvey world.In a novel that seems so far removed from our everyday reality, it is a powerful quality to feel that pang of recognition.

In that sense it is old fashioned, and refreshing. However, she needs to work on endings; this novel's ending is ambiguous and a bit hackneyed.

Its publication in 1899 ""The Awakening"" is a wonderfully ambiguous book that resonates more powerfully if one considers it in its historical context. Its publication in 1899 ostracized Chopin for the remainder of her life (she died in 1904) and for the mores and social values of the time it was a very scandalous work. Based on some of the s I have seen posted, it can still invoke the ire of readers. I have a feeling Chopin would be pleased.Chopin's protagonist, Edna Pontellier, is a woman in a daze. She has a comfortable life, a loving husband, and adoring children. And something is missing. ""The Awakening"" is the story of Edna's realization of what she wants out of life, and her pursuit to get it. Her story could be from 2009, except it isn't. It is 1899, and women should be happy with material wealth, nice kids, and a good husband. And Edna was, until her inner passions and desires are awakened by a summer flirtation.What makes this novel so excellent for reading and discussing is that you can see Edna as a women brave enough to liberate herself from society's bonds, or as cowardly and selfish in her hedonistic pursuits. And the text supports both interpretations. It is almost as if Chopin is admitting to her readers that even she has ambiguous feelings about her premise.This is not a text with a lot of action; the most important movement is in the character's heads. But if you want a text that will make you think, force a deep and close reading, and yield new insights (not all of them positive, Edna is not an especially likable women) every time you visit it, then ""The Awakening"" is for you.A great selection for book clubs, or classrooms, as the imagery and symbolism in the text allows for limitless interpretations....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,not set,"Jan 22, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/58345.The_Awakening

I am still not sure why, and the fault may be with me and not the text at all?One of the major strengths of this novel is the voice of its protagonist Ed Kennedy. Ed is a great first person narrator and he and his wonderfully crafted dog, the Doorman, are the book's main strengths. Ed's dry sense of humor is at times hysterical. The subtle changes in Ed's speech and actions as he becomes a better person throughout the novel is also well done, and artfully rendered. Ed becomes a better person by degrees, which is how it usually happens.The let down of the text is the didactic ending. It is a clever premise, despite what some s posted have said, but it just comes across as too preachy.Regardless, this is advertised as a young adult novel, and I think that less mature readers would love it. Plus, it has a good message, and the world cannot get enough of those....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,not set,not set,"Jan 19, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/19057.I_Am_the_Messenger

I am still thinking about it, and I fully realize that my views on it will undoubtedly change. I guess in my mind that makes it a classic.Rarely have I read a book that fully depicts the horror of the aftermath of war that does not feel the need to sermonize about war and its banality. Yet this book, which is gruesomely violent and disturbing at times, seems to fully embrace war as a part of human nature, and in its basest elements as a part of each and every one of us. That realization, along with the intense and gruesome details of the Civil War and the harsh realities of life in general at that time, serve as a knockout punch for the reader.Olmstead gives us a unique writing style and his syntactical choices at times are really simply stunning. He is clearly a very gifted writer. His description of the aftermath of Gettysburg is breathtaking. During this part of the novel you dare not stop reading for fear of how the world will appear if you look up from the page.He is also adept at characterization. Most notably with the protagonist's mother who is a haunting presence in the novel from her very first line of dialogue. The fact that she disappears in the first chapter and does not reappear until near the end of the text further highlights her great presence, as she dominates the novel throughout. There are in fact few, if any, characters who do not leap of the page and in some way grab the reader. A cameo appearance by two women sitting on a porch after the battle of Gettysburg being just such an example.The novel moves at a pace that carries the reader along, at times with dizzying swiftness that we (and the novel's protagonist) wish we could stop. But we can't. The journey is unfolding in all its harsh realism, though we wish it would not.An excellent text that would be good in college classrooms or book clubs. It will give you much to digest....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,not set,"Jan 19, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1728421.Coal_Black_Horse

The many disparate plot lines and events that Vonnegut ties together seem a natural fit under his great skills.Once again Vonnegut gives us a hapless protagonist who lets the waves of life wash over him, rarely taking the time to notice or care all that much. ""Jailbird"" is written as an autobiography of its central character Walter F. Starbuck. Walter's life has always been a life of the moment, and his very values and core beliefs are built upon sand, and shift accordingly. Starbuck is a massively empathetic person, but unfortunately he has learned such empathy only at the end of his life, and after numerous disappointments. Vonnegut seems to be asking why this is the way so many of us choose to learn empathy.Vonnegut also seems to be satirizing himself, and almost everyone else, when he gives Starbuck socialistic tendencies and acquaintances. Yet, nothing ever comes of these ideals. One reason I have always admired Vonnegut is that although his political beliefs are very leftist, he also has the honesty to admit that they will never work, as long as humans are the ones who try and implement them. The characters in this text are for the most part very decent people. It is the world and society we live in that keep them from soaring. Yet some of them are still able to perform the most decent acts of small kindness.The major strength of this book is that it is more narrative in style than many of Vonnegut's other works, and the storyline comes together in a very nice falling action that brings all the separate entities of its main character's life together in a very satisfying and clever way....more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,not set,not set,"Jan 19, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4987.Jailbird

Mr. Findley is at the top of his game with this text.The story, which flips from the late seventies, to 1915 Canada, to the battlefields of WW I is really a simple tale about people who see so much bad in the world, and yet who also try to do some good, and as with most actions in our lives, it has both good and bad consequences. Mr. Findley does not overly develop any of his characters, a motif of his, and this forces the reader to do a lot of thinking on their own. Some readers (based on some posted s) hate to think. But, if you don't allow this novel to digest then you will miss the point.One of the book's main points is that History is not just faded photos and dates, but rather real lives, and feelings, that in the moment were not history at all. The fact that some day some person will look back at our existence with the cold calculating eyes of a historian is chilling to the reader. The reason is simple, just like the characters in the text who cannot explain their motives or feelings, we too will be judged by those who can only look at our actions, and not know why or the thoughts behind them. A sobering contemplation.""The Wars"" takes a long hard look at the oft forgotten first world war and makes it real and immediate to the reader. We then gain a greater appreciation of the past, and of our own existence, because we see how all life is ""good and ill mixed together"".An excellent choice for book clubs....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Jan 19, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/29898.The_Wars

I am not sure that I believe it is fully either, but it is none the less a very interesting read.""Fear and Loathing"" claims to be a ""savage journey to the heart of the American Dream"" but I find it hard to believe it was all that honest of a search if one set out to pursue it as Mr. Thompson and his attorney claim they were. There is more drug use and hallucinations in this text, then I hope, most are used to. However, that is an integral part of the book, and works for what seems to be Thompson's ultimate goal.Although I don't approve of the lifestyle of its two main characters, they are in fact disgusting people, they are still intriguing, and I found the text to be an easy and enjoyable read. The last 100 pages are far superior to the first 100, as it is in the later half of the book that Mr. Thompson seems to be getting to his point.The ""American Dream"" really lives in the hearts and minds of those who pursue it, and thus if the heart and mind pursuing it are not all that together, then the dream seems to be lost. This book is peopled with such characters. Most are fearful of the world that surrounds them, and most also loathe themselves and the world around them. The book is an interesting exploration of our self destructive tendencies, and how we are the biggest inhibitors of our own happiness. Thompson laments the lost spirit of the 60s in this text, all the while truthfully acknowledging the only people to blame for that are the very people who preached and practiced it.Thompson has a very unique writing style. The man had talent and deserves to be praised for it. His sense of irony and wit are immensely enjoyable, and the prose fits the story and the personality of the text's main characters.
