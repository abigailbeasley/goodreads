Claire North aims to reinIthaca is an interesting addition to the wave of retellings and companion stories of classic tales from Greek mythology. Claire North aims to reinvent the Penelopiad, with a feminist slant that captures the quiet, hidden power of Penelope, the maids of Ithaca, and the goddesses of Mount Olympus. The novel brings forward the layered resilience and despondency of the women of Ancient Greece, who ruled, created order and strength in a time of chaos, only to be relegated again into limited roles by returning men while secretly both suffering and maintaining the stability of their lands. It also puts into stark relief the oppressive chauvinism of Ancient Greece and its Lost Generation, those men who came of age during and following the Trojan War, too young to fight and die as heroes on foreign shores and without leaders, kings, fathers to guide them, or surviving a long and seemingly pointless war to be confronted with the limited fruits of victory. And in their rage and impotence, they begin grasping for dominion: on Ithaca that includes eating, drinking, harassing Ornelope and the maids, and serving as loutish obstacles to anything constructive or productive for the kingdom.There’s a lot that can be done - the Odyssey picks - and North covers a lot of ground, but perhaps too much. The plot expands to cover various maids that serve Penelope, though we perhaps don’t get to know any of them quite as much as we’d like (Priene is a standout for sure). It also brings Elektra and Orestes to Ithaca in pursuit of their mother Clytemnestra, a twist and non-Homeric or Aeschylean narrative choice, that sometimes works well, especially to reflect on the complicated relationship North draws between Penelope and her son Telemachus, but often their presence crowds out the Ithacans.Perhaps the largest problem is North’s choice of narrator. Hera, Queen of the Gods, a greatly diminished figure herself, is telling the audience these tales that the poets do not. North writes Hera’s voice inconsistently in a way that is very distracting: we go from a voice that sounds mythic and laden with description perhaps overly purple with some clunky allusions - The island of Ithaca guards the watery mouth of Greece like an old cracked tooth  - to very snarky modern tone and language - These eggs eventually hatch, producing Castor and Pollux, the little twerps. The writing and tone tip back and forth, but for me at least, it didn’t provide a more friendly connection to Hera which I think was what was intended, to render her accessible to the mortals in the story and those reading her tale. Instead I found the snarky, modern language jarring and disruptive from the more common pseudo-mythical narration North uses, and it had the effect of finding the Queen of the Gods more petty than I would otherwise and it broke my immersion to North’s world.Ultimately, I think three stars is the right rating for this book for me: I did like it, and found it to be something of a worthwhile addition to the recent trends of feminist retellings and expanded editions of Greek myths. But the storytelling itself - so key in the source material and so well executed by other modern authors - is uneven and distracting and detracting from the overall effort. That said, I would pick up North’s next book in this series to see how she next tackles The Odyssey and Odysseus’s homecoming and how Penelope and her maids factor in to this versions murder of the suitors, and would hope there’s more consistency in tone and style and less faux comic arch. A solid if not inspiring read for lovers of Greek mythology....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Aug 30, 2022","Sep 02, 2022","Aug 30, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/59416521-ithaca

You were born to become that person.”While I wouldn't go so far as to call “You are not yet who you will one day be.” “You were not born that person. You were born to become that person.”While I wouldn't go so far as to call Carrie Soto Is Back an instant classic, it was fun, well-paced, and filled with smart observations, drama, heartbreak, and triumph, and a more layered set of characters with myriad themes and emotions that play out over the course of the novel. This is not - to borrow a tennis comparison - an early Serena-Venus match or a whodunit Federer-Djokovic-Nadal affair: Taylor Jenkins Reid's plot of the ex champion running it back one more time is really easily telegraphed and I knew exactly where the fault lines, twists, and even final outcome were fairly early on. But despite those slightly weaker points, it was pure JOY to read, zipping along with her breezy yet incisive writing and then staggering slightly when pops of raw truth or emotion would pop out. A fulsome four stars: a really solid, crowd-pleasing end of summer read that's more than meets the eye.“I’m telling you, hija, the greatest match of your career is ahead of you.” It is such a kind thing for him to say - exactly the sort of thing a father like him would tell a daughter like me. Full of heart and love and belief, and maybe a little bit untrue.What is so compelling is that on the one hand, the plot is really simple. Carrie Soto had a brilliant run in her teens and twenties as a dominant, fierce Grand Slam champion, retired from injury, and then is pushed to defend her record against the next generation of shiny bright tennis stars. But Carrie Soto Is Back turns out to be so much more than that, and Jenkins Reid does a great job of lulling the reader off balance to bring some introspection into what it means to win, to lose, to be great, to fail, how we wrap ourselves in the stories we tell about ourselves, what we believe and what we're desperately afraid to face. Carrie is on the comeback in tennis, but she's also starting to put together what it means to be a human being outside of tennis, and her relationship with her father is a study in pride and ambition, faith, and coping (or not coping) with grief loss (Carrie's mother passed away young and tennis is what both Carrie and Javier use to move forward / escape / channel their emotions). “Well, guess what, Carrie? People who are actually playing the game lose. We all lose. We lose all the time. That is life. So we are not the same, Soto. I have courage. You’re just good at tennis.”Then there's the intertwining of athletics and combat, joy, life. It's a well-worn cliche from any pro sports broadcast about how the game is a metaphor for life and athletes are ""warriors"", ""heroes"", and wins and losses are framed in moral terms, victories and losses that mean something to fans and players (and the bottom line). Jenkins Reid really craftily handles all of these threads well and in some interesting ways: Carrie is called ""Achilles"" by her father and her dedication to domination above all else is so pronounced in the early chapters, I thought we were destined for a heel injury in Paris (ha ha), but instead Jenkins Reid asks some interesting questions about how a sports loving audience doesn't give their athletic heroes the same range of emotion and human fragility as Homer gave his Trojan and Greek heroes. How especially female athletes have a limited box and set of identities they can assume, and to deviate from those and even more importantly to deviate from what is expected is side-eyed. And Carrie has only ever wanted to be the GOAT, so it's deeply personal and difficult to break that down and rebuild.This is the tiniest beginning of a terrible, beautiful whole new life.We get to know the titular Carrie somewhat slowly: she narrates her past successes and present set mission to reclaim her Grand Slam throne and fend off the younger challengers looking to replace her all-time record. She's remote, singularly driven, prickly and thin skinned at first, but that's by design: we get to know Carrie as Carrie gets to know Carrie. She's never been able or known she could be anything more than what was necessary to dominate her sport. And Jenkins Reid populates Carrie's world with some solid side characters - I wanted more Gwen! more Nicki Chan! - to give Carrie opportunities to find new and previously unknown ways she is and can be. And by the time we're cresting through Carrie's Grand Slam season and I see the plot ""twists"" coming from pages and pages away, it doesn't matter because Jenkins Reid has given us readers the thing we want to root for the most, the vulnerable, fully human hero. And again, even knowing how the stage was going to be set, I was feeling all the same excitement and adrenaline at the end with tears of joy and pathos for Carrie.This the first of Jenkins Reid's books I've read, and it will definitely not be the last. Carrie Soto Is Back, and Jenkins Reid is an author that's here to stay in my book.

I came to Alex Aster’s YA debut Lightlark via an interesting profile in The Guardian. I haven’t been reading as much this year but wanted to see one of the fruits of TikTok's shaping of reading trends, so grabbed the ARC on edelweiss to evaluate the book without any prior exposure to it from BookTok.A quick search after reading revealed some very VERY strong opinions about the author, her deal, and the book itself. I can see how those who follow Aster would be disappointed if specific claims about the story or plot didn’t come to fruition; my  I suppose is more relevant for those who didn’t follow this book’s creation over social media and are browsing the new release tables at a local bookstore. So would I recommend buying Lightlark?Eh, no.I’m landing on a two star rating of “it was ok”, because I typically reserve one-star ratings for things I hate or truly do not understand. Lightlark is not worthy of hate: it is forgettable and devoid of real weight, while also not being that much fun to read. The premise (different kingdoms/factions/peoples come together for quests/trials with death and power as the high stakes) is essentially a pastiche of other YA works but is overly convoluted and nonsensical. This is not helped by worldbuilding that is piecemeal: the author does a lot of info dumping in the exposition but there are holes in the worldbuilding tied to the premise that are not always unfilled for dramatic license and for the sake of the plot. Pace is also a bit uneven: the exposition takes up the vast majoritiy of the book, the climax and ending are very small, packed with “twists”, and comes so fast and at once that it’s jarring. And there are plenty of fantasy novels that also do long expositions and worldbuilding and development for most of book, but it’s usually punctuated with compelling character development and interesting scenes to provide the platform to jump into the climax. In Lightlark that sense of propulsion is missing, the trials themselves are not thrilling or present real moments of challenge for the heroine.Characterization here is pretty tough: Isla the heroine is written as beautiful, powerless but also powerful, and sheltered… and that’s it, very bland. The love interests are similarly fairly one note and cliche: Grim is old, shadowed, dark haired, tortured, sexually charged Nightshade; Oro is removed, stoic with a secret heart of gold, radiant sunshine Sunling. And using “love” interest feels false: there’s maybe a slow build up of mutual respect and some attraction between Isla and Oro, but Isla and Grim share nothing more than a ""will they, won’t they"" sexual attraction. (view spoiler)[The author’s decision to show both rulers as in love with Isla at the end AND to try and deepen the relationship with Grim by saying they’d been in love for a year but he’d been erasing her memories was predictable while not unearned as the author didn't fully show this love on the page, and in the case of the Grim reveal, it was also an annoying shortcut that felt like something out of Vampire Diaries or some other poorly written CW show. (hide spoiler)] And maybe this really comes down to the writing. Lightlark’s writing is pretty sophomoric and can be oddly disjointed. The problems with pacing and with characterization could have been masked a bit with better writing, instead the writing fails to launch the characters and bring them to life, and bogs the reader down through the trials and ruler team up parts and adds to the slow pacing. On a more nitpicky point, there are certain author quirks present early in the story (especially use of “thing” to describe landscapes, nature and singing) that disappear later, and then other repetitive crutches (why is everyone doing everything “meanly”???) that pop up later. I love fantasy, adult or YA, and there are plenty of examples of debuts and new series that borrow from the books that came before but add to the genre or are just such a good time to read. Lightlark was an easy, empty, and mostly unenjoyable reading experience. As a non-BookTok or TikTok person, I can't comment on how the book is an indictment of publishing to algorithmic tastes. And it wasn't horrible or problematic. But to me, the best fantasies are those you feel immersed in and transported by, and this book was incapable of accomplishing that....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Aug 17, 2022","Aug 17, 2022","Aug 18, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60310757-lightlark

In theory, I sI'll caveat my lukewarm  (2.5 stars rounded up to 3) by acknowledging that it's probably not Natasha Pulley's fault, it's all me. In theory, I should really like her books! Dear friends of mine with overlapping taste adore them. Her books are fantastical, involve rich descriptions and scenery and glorious tangles of language, often set in historical periods and I truly love a good historical fiction fantasy; I mean I reread Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell at least once a year! And yet, I briefly started The Watchmaker of Filigree Street and was quickly unimpressed and stopped, I made it just a bit further with The Bedlam Stacks but could not connect. The Kingdoms is therefore the first Natasha Pulley fiction I've ever finished, and I've come to the clear conclusion that it's not meant to be for me and this author. The Kingdoms has a great premise - a portal between past and present in the nineteenth century, a so-diagnosed amnesiac man trying to put together the pieces of his life, the Napoleonic wars between Britain and France as the backdrop, the stakes being freedom and true love of course. But I found it to be somewhat of a mess to read: sometimes it seemed as though sentences were missing, we'd move along from idea to idea and scene to scene without any fluid transition or connection with what came before. The big twists that covered Joe's identity I saw coming very early on so there was little that surprised me throughout. Characters die very abruptly and other characters barely seem to react to their passing, which could make sense given the war context of the plot but it reads awkwardly and unfinished, the reader is just buffeted along to the next scene. I wonder if Pulley was trying so hard to maintain the mystery and not tip her hand too early that she swung a bit too far in the secrecy and instead made scene connections sparse and thus made the plot more convoluted than it needed to be.And perhaps because of this weird plot convolution and lack of significant connectivity from scene to scene, I never much cared for any of the lead characters, nor the love story across time that again was hinted at but left so much until the end I suppose to maintain the mystery and give readers small breadcrumbs to follow and piece together. If that was what was intended, for me it left the characters emotionally removed from me as the reader, and I grew to feel neutrally toward them to ambivalent dislike. (A particular moment was quite jarring and made me feel less invested in the big reveal I'd already guessed.)At any rate, I could have easily rounded this down to two stars, but I did think the prose was good (even if I prefer other wordsmith type authors and don't rate Pulley that highly) and I did enjoy many of the descriptions of settings. I would have loved more of the alternate England and Scotland and more immersion into places, as that also might have helped draw me into the book more. So I'm landing on a lukewarm ""I liked rating"": I would recommend this to those who have previously enjoyed Pulley's books, and for fans of historical fiction fantasy that are willing to wrestle with some interesting ideas and messy execution. But this shall be my last time reading Pulley, alas she's simply not for me....more",Notes are private!,0,67,1,"Jan 20, 2021","Jan 23, 2021","Jan 20, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54680112-the-kingdoms

I'm not a huge psychological thrillerThe blurb and the cover sold me: Greek tragedy, charismatic and maybe dangerous professor, Cambridge, a mystery. I'm not a huge psychological thriller reader but felt maybe The Maidens would work for me and kept my expectations going in fairly neutral. How naive I was. This felt like Michaelides took the trappings of The Secret History and put them into a blender with a YA version of a dime store mystery. This book wears a veneer of being literary and deeply penetrating, with lofty speeches and women therapists and academic ""investigators"" plumbing the mind of a monster and scenes from Euripides in equal measure, but the Emperor really is stark nude: The Maidens is an average, surface-skimming thriller with few actual thrills and gave me no characters to care for at all. I found the writing really unremakable and unbelievable, from some of the set pieces that strained credulity for a pyschological mystery to the really weak, unbelievable dialogue... As one example, the protagonist is dining with the dangerous Professor Fosca and she mentions that one of the girls is dead (no spoilers, the death of a young woman is in the blurb) and the Professor's response is ""Do you think you can see inside my soul?"" Even for the biggest preening, elite academic character ever conceived in literature (and this is not that), it read entirely inauthentic and eyeroll worthy. Michaelides also tended to use short chapters that I found ended entirely abruptly and lacking any kind of oomph or frisson of fear/curiosity/excitement to get the reader eager to turn the page and discover more, and that also ratcheted down the potential atmosphere he was looking to develop. It took me awhile to even finish - and I am typically a pretty fast reader - because I kept starting and stopping, and those limp chapter codas contributed to my increasing disinterest. There are probably ideas in here that could have been really interesting if they had been fleshed out and given space and time in the narrative, but instead some things felt either underused or like red herrings, just of the slapdash variety rather than the clever kind. And I shan't spoil the ending but suffice it to say it seemed entirely obvious AND completely implausible at the same time.I have no idea who this book is for or aimed at: I would think if you like psychological mystery-thrillers this has too much psych done in a very bland way and not enough thrills and there are plenty of better books out there for that, and if you want them with a dose of elitist escapism and the dark academia vibes I refer you to The Secret History or If We Were Villains, among others. I'm going to end with two stars because even if I didn't like this much or find much to recommend about it, it wasn't bad bad, but it was entirely boring, added nothing novel or exciting to thrillers and covered ground less well than previous books occupying similar spaces, and was ultimately disappointing and forgettable....more",Notes are private!,0,45,1,"Jan 24, 2021","Feb 09, 2021","Jan 04, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45300567-the-maidens

With The Great Gatsby entering the public domain in 2021, it seems likely that numerous retellings, prequels and sequels will emerge: Vo's bold, spirited storytelling is likely to set the standard. I'd go as far as saying The Chosen and the Beautiful demonstrates why the end of copyright and passing into public domain is a good thing in literature: Vo grounds us in Fitzgerald's world and stays faithful to the source text while simultaneously immersing us in her incarnation of Jordan Baker and the lives of Daisy, Nick, Gatsby and Tom. It's a tremendously impressive feat, and all the more that I didn't notice just how impressive it was while reading it, I was so engrossed in and enthralled by Vo's narrative....it was a crowded summer, and it was not until later, when I could thread the steps to disaster together like glass beads on a string, that those times stood out at all.Vo's Jordan Baker is the linchpin of the novel, and as a character and a fulcrum, she is fascinating. Jordan is an ""adopted"" member of the Baker family, of Vietnamese heritage, part of Louisville and New York high society but also slightly apart from it. This allows Vo to explore in depth some of the subtext of The Great Gatsby: the themes about class struggles, xenophobia, racial discrimination, and white supremacy that are lightly threaded in Fitzgerald's work get a full exploration. Jordan's summer with Nick and the doomed pairing of Gatsby and Daisy is thrown in relief against the passage of the Manchester Act, fictional but mirroring the acts of 1921 and 1924 that effectively banned immigration from Asia. The more overt Fitzgerald themes of hedonism and the liberation of the Jazz Age are also explored, some turned on their head, some just given new dimensionality. The cautionary tale of the The Great Gatsby is still intact looking at how East Egg engages with black magic and demons in their pursuit of pleasure and fun. But Vo also critiques the caution as Jordan and other characters (no spoilers) are queer: the social restrictions of the 1920s and the potentially deadly consequences of being simply who you are, with those restraints most firmly enforced on women, belie the free flapper image so strongly associated with Fitzgerald. Now there was a monstrous want there, remorseless and relentless, and it made my stomach turn that it thought itself love.Daisy, as pretty as she was, was never sweet either, though she sparkled so bright it was easy to think she was. It was easy to think that Daisy was many things.All of this would be admirable and thought-provoking, but The Chosen and the Beautiful is so much more than that! We see new sides and depths to Daisy, backstory that complicates the Fitzgerald portrayal while still in keeping with her character as we know it from the original. Nick, the narrator for Fitzgerald, is given a lot of examination by Jordan and his personality, role in the story, and surprising twist near the end were so well-done I can't say more for fear of spoiling it. Gatsby is less hidden and yet more opaque and sinister yet sincere in Vo's retelling. But the novel rightly belongs to Jordan. She's bold and fun, quick witted and reading people and social situations with grace and sharpness, but she's also dealing with being a bit unmoored, never fully home or at ease. She's incredibly self-actualized and much more solid than the other characters, which is coupled with a journey of self-exploration and growth to strength and true confidence that I was rooting for throughout. And Vo's magical infusions to the story just add to the atmosphere: it was so seductive and sensual, just as Gatsby's parties must have been, allowing the reader to be drawn in and forget the very real, urgent issues facing all of the characters in 1922 (and all of us now). Vo has a way with description and dialogue which propelled me forward but enchanted me on each page: swimmers in Gatsby's pool take the forms of carp and glint gold and vermillion beneath the water before they resurface as human, Daisy and Jordan's dark adventure in Louisville is thrilling and powerful. And this despite knowing how it would all end of course: the journey was truly the point even if I was so interested to see how Vo would draw our destination. Under the wrack and wreck of what had come before, the sky was new, and I reached for it with a yearning eager hand.I finished the novel both completely satisfied and spellbound but also wanting so much more. A beautiful, beautiful book. 5 stars, highly recommended to fans of literary fiction with touches of magic and fantasy, and I can't wait to read more from Vo!...more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,"Dec 11, 2020","Dec 17, 2020","Dec 11, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55169019-the-chosen-and-the-beautiful

Read over a few hours from early evening to the early hours of the morning, I was glued toFirekeeper's DaI literally could not put this book down. Read over a few hours from early evening to the early hours of the morning, I was glued toFirekeeper's Daughter, a stunning YA debut by Angeline Boulley that is harrowing, disturbing, triggering, informative, beautiful, transcendent. It's a thriller but also a cultural story, a coming of age tale, and a tale of love between individuals and within an Ojibwe community, and Boulley does a really tremendous job weaving all of these elements together and really letting her protagonist, our heroine Daunis, come to the fore as a teen making sense of her past, finding her place in the present, and charting her future.I went in knowing almost nothing about this book - got reeled in by the colors and illustration of the cover! - and was caught off guard by the combination of the easily accessible writing and the depth and richness of Daunis describing her Anishinaabe community that she is both of and apart from as a half-white, unenrolled member of the tribe. I was then completely caught off guard for the level of horrifying violence that ensued in the narrative, especially State violence and racism, domestic violence, sexual violence, and violence against women. The story infuses more of these violent incidents towards the climax of the novel, and Boulley forces the reader to confront the past and present injustices done towards Indigenous peoples across the United States and especially Indigenous women while still keeping us wrapped in the larger story and demonstrating clearly that Daunis and the other Anishinaabe kwe are also imbued with power and agency and will be greeted and treated holistically on their own terms. It takes a skilled storyteller to deliver both an important because of the issues book and a narratively brilliant book, and Boulley is an expert. I don't think I'll say much more to allow readers to experience Firekeeper's Daughter for themselves without too many spoilers. But this was a really phenomenal, surprising, heartrending read and I could definitely see this breaking out of YA like The Hate U Give did. 5 stars!...more",Notes are private!,0,58,1,"Dec 11, 2020","Dec 12, 2020","Dec 11, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/50762972-firekeeper-s-daughter

We follow the narrator, Josephine, (Joe while at school, Sephine in her adult life after shedding the Divine from her life) as she uncovers, recalls, processes who she was, who she is, and what happened all those years ago, flipping back and forth between her school days and her present life. Eaton tackles material that often comes up in the coming of age young girl tale - exploring sexuality, toxic friendship, mean girls, cliques, isolation and loneliness and the pathological need to belong for some - and leans into some of the darker, crueler aspects of the teenage girl experience.What's clever is Eaton doesn't only do this: she also is really focused on perception and reality, the visions and versions of these girls and then women that they create, recreate, recall, to fit in, to fit out, to protect themselves from trauma, to transcend what trauma was inflicted upon them or that they dished out to others. We see Josephine through a broken carnival mirror, getting parts of her that make a whole but is also distorted somehow: the Joe she thinks she is as Divine, the Joe the other girls see and interact with, the Sephine she's created to break from her past and reinvent herself, and the Sephine that still has Joe lurking within her and cannot break away. Eaton often has little mirrors for her characters spliced in the narrative - one Divine character becomes a child psychologist trauma specialist yet the confrontation of the trauma at Divine is revealing. It's smart, sharp, and unnerving to read. Reading it is a bit like handling something beautiful, broken, and dangerous: it's not an entirely pleasurable experience and perhaps it brings up painful reminders of what it was to be that teenage girl, but you appreciate it and its craftsmanship even though it's uncomfortable.My only complaint - because cruel, selfish but interestingly flawed, vulnerable, compelling characters don't stop me really liking something - is that the pacing seemed off and the ending, while making a degree of thematic sense, seemed very undercooked. After a creepy prologue, the book unfolds fairly slowly and it takes longer than it should to understand the lingo and set the scene and stakes. But then it starts moving as we see Sephine unraveling her past and a bit herself in the present while also being transported to a building tension between Joe in her past relationships, with Skipper and the Divine girls, with Gerry, with Lauren, with Stuart. But then, at the climax - the reveal of the scandal and a reunion of sorts - I felt as though we were left wanting more, that the confrontations and discussions and reflections from Sephine or other characters were not enough. I was left deeply unsatisfied by the ending... And yet I think this was part of Eaton's point, stretching that discomfort, that dissatisfaction, that prickly, looming guilt and disgust and anxiety and titillation across the full range of the novel. When does something end? When we choose for it to? Maybe, but it's been a few hours and I can't quite shake the unnerving feeling I had reading this book. It lingered, and not in ways I necessarily liked or enjoyed, but I still marvel at the force of it. And that mirrors how Eaton's characters are dealing with their own endings and becomings and pasts. I don't even know if I can recommend this book, but I'd hope that if the blurb and this somewhat bizarre  have intrigued you, you give it a try. 4 stars and I will be both eagerly and anxiously awaiting and dreading future books by Ellie Eaton. ...more",Notes are private!,-1,40,1,"Nov 13, 2020","Nov 14, 2020","Oct 31, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53018367-the-divines

I love Greek mythology and always gravitIt's very possible I'm simply not the right reader for this particular combination of things I normally love. I love Greek mythology and always gravitate toward the myriad retellings and extensions that emerge (read all of The Lightning Thief and the Percy Jackson series on the YA side, really liked Bright Air Black and House of Names on the adult side). And while YA is not my go-to, I do read YA fiction/fantasy. Lore was a fairly easy read that I managed in a few hours despite being somewhat dense, and it did have some interesting ideas at times. But ultimately I found the storyline - basically every seven years some Greek gods are sent to Earth as humans and they are hunted and protected by various descendants of heroes who can ascend to replace the gods if they kill them - and especially the characters to be entirely unmemorable and the romance(s) to be boring and mostly told rather than shown. The relationship between Lore and Castor (which is telegraphed VERY early) is based almost entirely on their prior friendship and affections as children, and so even though we do see some of that friendship, there's almost no connection to their adult interactions now so it reads like instalove coming out of nowhere that we as the reader don't invest in or really care about because we haven't been shown its development in real time (which appears to be a trend in YA fiction as this also occurred in These Violent Delights although that book had more to offer overall IMO).It also seemed to have way too much going on so that nothing was ever homed in on and executed really well. A friendship with Iro is intriguing but barely covered, there's some coverage of feminism and erasure of women from heroic roles in Greek mythology (but not in ways that haven't already been done by other retailers/expansionists working in this genre), at some point there's potential child molestation going on with little warning that is dealt with swiftly but not expounded upon, maybe there's the notion that other gods are alive too or how are they interacting but then that's dropped... and so on. I think at least some of that may be due to the derivative nature of the work: when you are pulling some bits from The Hunger Games and The Lightning Thief and maybe a pinch of Red Rising plus adding some urban YA fantasy trappings/writing style a la those Shadowhunters books, things can get a little messy. And while a writing style I appreciate and connect with can elevate unevenness, here the writing exacerbated the issues. I have no problem juggling massive character maps and power systems and whatnot, but Bracken's writing style made things more confusing, opaque, convoluted than they needed to be. Sometimes the detail seemed to be applied in all the wrong places, and I finished this in spite of the writing not because of it. I just didn't think Lore holds up well as its own thing when its execution is sloppy and there's so many ideas and elements but Bracken doesn't cover any of them in depth. And while I can write pretty in depth s for books I rate lower, I simply don't care enough about what I read nor do I even want to expend the energy to look at my ARC and expound much more than this, which is telling.I'll fully admit I was perhaps not the right reader for this book. But I wouldn't recommend this to lovers of Greek mythology who were intrigued by the cover as I was, and I didn't find this to be a great or particularly strong example of YA fiction/fantasy. So I'll go with 2 stars, totally readable and it was ok, appears to be standalone but that's immaterial as I'd have no interest in continuing to read a series....more",Notes are private!,0,30,1,"Oct 30, 2020","Oct 31, 2020","Oct 31, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53375824-lore

It's fairly well-documented that dual timeline novels can be very difficult to execute well: there's always the risk that one is more interesting and better written than the other, and this happens even to pretty seasoned authors. In The Lost Apothecary, following Nella and Eliza's convergence in 1791 is interesting: the descriptions are fluid and the language lightly poetically illustrative in that historical fiction way, and the various settings and conflicts the two characters are facing and the way their pasts inform their present paths are compelling. By contrast, our present day narrator, Caroline, is pitiable and I felt some empathy for her situation, but she and her story as Penner tells it is not nearly as interesting or compelling as the characters, setting, and mystery of 1791. Had the book been exclusively or more predominantly focused on Nella and Eliza, we might have been able to be shown more of their backstories (rather than told about it in some weighty exposition) and the potential threat of exposure of Nella's murderous brews could have been explored in greater detail and given more emotional heft. Instead, the reader is forced to flash back into the present to Caroline and cuts off some of the engagement from the past and indulges Caroline's ""mystery"" of discovering and putting the pieces together, which is far more mundane.This also ties into another small criticism that lessened some of my enjoyment and appreciation for the writing: Penner uses first person narration for Nella, Eliza, and Caroline, but the trappings of the time period notwithstanding, there isn't a huge amount of variety in writing style between the three women. Eliza is supposed to be a twelve-year-old, yes precocious but still, twelve, and yet her parts seemed to be covering a similar perspective as Nella and Caroline, adult women. This storytelling choice made the narrative feel a bit less authentic and for me at least increased the emotional distance I had from the characters, since it was harder to lock onto their voices and perspectives and I needed to look more to the clear plot elements and backstories to differentiate them.The ending of the past also seemed somewhat dissatisfying to me, a strange deus ex machina and magical intervention when much of the novel centered on the skills, knowledge and passions of women and natural remedies to heal themselves and forge new lives for themselves in rebuke of magical thinking. (I also didn't care for Caroline as mentioned above, and the ending of the present story was at least to me unsurprising and obvious from her opening narrative chapters). I'd also note that this is much less a mystery/thriller than the blurb might suggest: where the stakes were high for Nella and Eliza, again getting pulled into the present diminished some of the excitement and concern for those characters, and the stakes for Caroline were quite low. Even when Caroline finally enters the ""dangerous collision course"", it was quite unbelievable that things were actually dire for her. And again, at least for me, the mystery solving of the present was more tedious than engaging. Finally, I'm still not sure what Penner was getting at or trying to say about motherhood in the book: (view spoiler)[ many women want to become mothers in the book but they are blocked in a variety of ways from being able to bear children; only Eliza who was afraid of beginning her period and was nearly a victim of rape ends up becoming a mother of the main characters... and I just have no idea if there was supposed to be something profound or symbolic happening here, but it somewhat rubbed me the wrong way. (hide spoiler)]Overall, The Lost Apothecarywas a very solid book and I did enjoy it for the most part, so a 3 star rating seems most appropriate, but there were some things that did not work as well for me as they may for others. I'd recommend to fans of historical fiction with a sort of feminist twist and those that like present/past entwined narratives. And I would be willing to read Sarah Penner's next book in the hopes that she's continued the good of the The Lost Apothecary and hopefully improved upon some of her debut's less strong elements....more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"Jan 23, 2021","Jan 24, 2021","Oct 23, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53288434-the-lost-apothecary

Our viewpoint into this world is animated and limited by Klara, our AI Artificial Friend protagonist with keenly observant but purposely imperfect perspective. The novel was less enthralling or emotional for me than some other readers, but it was strangely propulsive and haunting, with a downer ending that was note perfect to the discordant, jagged narrative built prior. The narrative with the little mystery unfolded slowly but also stayed closed, this novel didn't give away its secrets and there's still a lot left unexplained by the end. And yet that felt right to me: it plumbs the interior elements of the various human characters Klara interacts with while also keeping some removed distance by virtue of Klara's perspective.This was my second read by Ishiguro - I previously read The Buried Giant and did not like it - and I think I clearly need to read more of his work. I think that's what impressed me most about the novel is the execution: the sustained, consistent approach, the working of various themes and elements into a quietly powerful narrative, the tense, moody, disturbing underpinnings of various actions and ideas that never coalesce into an overwhelming wave but continue to unnerve through the final paragraph. Ishiguro never falters in his execution of this vision, and even if I did not love the novel by the end I couldn't help but be engaged, impressed, and admiring of the work. 4 stars and recommend for Ishiguro lovers and literary fiction enthusiasts that like a touch of the dystopian/creepy/speculative and are willing to work and wait for some of the intellectual and emotional payoffs....more",Notes are private!,0,32,1,not set,Mar 2021,"Oct 22, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54120408-klara-and-the-sun

And I read almost all of them: I'm a Jane Austen fan, with Persuasion as my all time fave but you never forget your first love and for me it's Pride and Prejudice. Thus, I read Molly Greeley's The Heiress which gives animation, back AND forward story, and spirit to Anne de Bourgh, ""the heiress of Rosings Park"", P&P's faux foil to our heroine Elizabeth Bennet and purported intended of Mr. Darcy and thus a miniature impediment to their love story. Greeley uses some parts of the P&P source material of course - the characters, the setting, some major plot elements - but I was pleasantly surprised just how little Greeley uses the Austen trappings. Instead, she delivers a very interior portrait of a woman coming into her own, breaking free from her dominating mother, lack of self esteem, the strict social conventions of the time, and also bringing to the world of Austen the real life examples of the philosophy of Mary Wollstonecraft and the life of Anne Lister, which makes The Heiress a 21st century feminist romantic novel firmly grounded in Austen contemporary norms and ideas of feminism, female freedom, motherhood, friendship and sexuality. And as we break from what we know of Anne in P&P, the novel steams forward: we are still grounded in Austen but freed as Anne is freed: it's a wonderful duality and our discovery of Greeley's narrative mirrors Anne's own discovery:I found myself teetering between a blank sort of fear, the unfilled years stretching like great sheets of empty paper before me, on which I had no idea what to write; and a curious giddiness for which nothing logical could account. Everything changed with my cousin’s letter; all certainty was gone from my life, save the one that surrounded and constrained me at all times. ..And yet, even as I felt the house closing around me, I had the strangest sensation of freedom, of having escaped from something, so narrowly that the something nearly rent the skirt of my gown with its claws as I raced away from it.For the most part, I found that the novel succeeded with its aims: it's a novel of manners and ideas, similarly constrained as the source material, but the depth of the emotion and movement and propulsive growth in Anne's discovery of self and the world around her was well-developed and truly affecting by the end. The changes Greeley makes to Austen canon can still fit with P&P while also providing new avenues to explore and consider. The romance was well drawn and touching, and again I felt struck that fine balance between modern sensibilities and Regency norms. Anne is a LOVER of reading and later writing and in a way that rang very true (and is of course appealing to the Eliza Bennet Stans that love ""something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading""). If you like Jane Austen retellings/sequels generally and can work with something still constrained to an Austen-like framework but with modern infusions, you'll like The Heiress. For me, this was better than Longbourn, Eligible: A Modern Retelling of Pride & Prejudice or The Jane Austen Project and far better than the IMO horrible Mary B: An Untold Story of Pride and Prejudice. If you are in the mood for an Austen extension, The Heiress is a solid, well-told choice. 4 stars....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Jan 06, 2021","Jan 06, 2021","Oct 22, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53018378-the-heiress

Chris Bohjalian takes us to Boston in the 1660s and delving into the perilous difficulties - often fatal - of being a woman, a nonconformist, an outsider, a progressive, or a person with an open mind in a Puritanical society, and without a heavy hand lets the reader make inferences and connections to current gains and entrenched misogyny and structural barriers for women in society. This is a women as witch book, not a book of magic, and it's a great character study and the heroine, Mary, was both relatable and seemingly very true to her time and background: a strong believer in God and the Devil, fearful for her soul and questioning of her intentions and motivations, but also a believer in herself, understanding and challenging the cruelty and inhumanity of her husband's violence against her, and growing in understanding and compassion of others over the course of the novel.So having said all of that, why am I only rating this three stars? First, while this is my first time reading something by Chris Bohjalian, it's definitely not my first foray into Salem-esque fiction and nonfiction looking at the witch hunts in the colonies and in Europe. And this is a good and worthy entrant into the category, but I don't think it brought anything new to the landscape. I also think that there was even less brought to bear on the psychological motivations of the accusers, because here those who condemned Mary had intimate, specific, and small reasons for doing so, rather than some of the more complex understandings of say the accusers and witnesses in the Salem witch trials. I think in Hour of the Witch whether we look at the male or female accusers and witnesses, the motivations are not deeply complex. And when most of this book revolves around Mary's trials, to only have the bulk of the psychological profile completed only for Mary and Thomas seemed like a miss.I also think that Bohjalian's foreshadowing device interrupted some of my enjoyment of the novel and ultimately did too much to telegraph what was going to unfold. Hour of the Witch headlines each chapter with testimony from Mary's trials, giving the reader an early p of what is to come. While this can be a really neat device that builds tension, atmosphere, or adds to the mystery and the desire to solve it, its use here served the opposite for me. Because I knew certain things were going to unfold and Mary would get to certain points in the narrative, some of the tension and mystery of the unknown would abate. The clinical quoting of testimony reduced the atmosphere and potential eeriness Bohjalian might have been inculcating. And typically, you want the device to be brought back once the reader catches up with it in the narrative, but in a new or slightly different way, or a way that puts the pieces together for the characters and/or reader and reveals something unexpected. That definitely doesn't happen here: the fragments that foreshadow come up in the narrative as they are meant to and reveal no more or less than what they did as earlier headlines. This ended up aggravating and disappointing me and detracted a bit from my enjoyment of the novel because I knew a bit too much about what was going to happen. Ultimately, I liked this book and thought it was solid, well-written and researched, and presented us an interesting and complex character in Mary whose thoughts, desires, bravery and fears I really appreciated getting to know and spend time with. But I think the narrative and storyline was not as strong as it could have been, both because of predictability and self-spoilering and because we didn't get the same degree of complexity for most characters outside of Mary, and at least from my readings of fiction and nonfiction dealing with witch hunts, it's the interplay between accusers and accused within the society and the complex human impulses that was most fascinating and horrifying. So I'd give this 3.5 stars, rounded down to 3 stars. I would recommend it to those that like historical fiction and psychological studies of characters, and I am looking forward to reading more of Bohjalian's work in the future....more",Notes are private!,-1,35,1,"Oct 22, 2020","Oct 22, 2020","Oct 22, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54063343-hour-of-the-witch

The Saardam's cargo is sin, and all who board her will be brought to merciless ruin. She will not reach Amsterdam.""The Devil and the Dark Water was - for the vast majority of the read - a suspenseful rollercoaster ride of a book, great fun, and mostly well-executed aside from some slow pacing and a strange ending. It is historical fiction plus a detective novel, as the colorful cast of characters embark on the high seas headed for Amsterdam (potentially by way of Hell) and rapidly begin suspecting each other of nefarious deeds and thoughts as the voyage grows perilously complicated for all them. Turton is great at exposition: I whipped through the first 100-150 pages, every chapter seemingly ended on a mini cliffhanger or small character or plot reveal that I was desperate to know more about. Even when the pacing could have been quicker in the middle of the book, Turton had built such goodwill earlier for me that I was still entirely engaged. The narrative had great atmosphere and use of language to set a scene and mood that I was still hooked. And I really wasn't able to put all of the pieces together, Turton played the endgame close to the chest and so I was compelled to uncover the mystery even if some things I perhaps suspected. BUT I am coming in at 4 stars and rounding down from 4.5 because I found the ending to be truly odd and an unfortunate letdown, especially when juxtaposed against the eerie, haunting promise of the earlier cliffhangers and mini mysteries. That said, it was a fun, spooky read and while I may not read it again, I enjoyed it and would recommend it with some caveats. To determine if this is a book for you: First, do you like historical fiction and aren't a tremendous purist or aren't one all the time? The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet this ain't, despite the Dutch and ship connections. The atmosphere is rendered beautifully but the dialogue sometimes seems more modern than it should. The women of the book and ESPECIALLY one of the main characters Sara are very feminist and somewhat not in sync with the time period setting, almost to the point of not being entirely believable. For example, early on in the novel Sara, a noblewoman and the wife of the Governor General, ministers to a leper that has just self-immolated, which seemed improbable at best. But Turton makes his heroines very likable, compelling, and flawed (but still strong), so it ultimately worked for me. If this sounds good, do you like light mysteries and detective stories? There's perhaps not as much sleuthing as I might have liked, and I feel readers might badger Turton for a prequel of Sammy and Arendt solving mysteries and getting into scrapes. But there's still enough mystery, whodunits, and assembly of the detective team to be enjoyable and believable. If you're into both these things and wouldn't mind a fairly seamlessly melded mashup, you are in for treat!...more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Oct 02, 2020","Oct 02, 2020","Oct 02, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51854625-the-devil-and-the-dark-water

The CommiPerhaps the zaniest, most jaw dropping read I had in 2020, this book is now out (March 2021) and I'm finally getting around to ing it. The Committed returns to the improbable life story of protagonist of The Sympathizer which not necessary but probably quite helpful to read that first (I did not read it and while I could have used some backstory sometimes I just let myself get swept into the current story). And it's essentially a dark comedy with smart, incisive observations about culture, politics, religion, war, colonialism, identity, masculinity, race relations, in France, Vietnam, and the U.S... I found myself laughing out loud, nodding ferociously, smirking and marking down lines. Like we get:That night my aunt and I smoked the finest hashish and drank the finest Haut-Medoc and listened to the finest American jazz, that black-and-blue music so beloved by the French partially because every sweet note reminded them of American racism, which conveniently let them forget their own racismAndThe most difficult thing, when offered two false choices, was imagining a third choice, withheld deliberately or otherwise. This was the most basic lesson of the dialectic, the swing between thesis and antithesis that allowed one to reach a synthesis. Whether the thesis or the antithesis was communism or anticommunism, the point was that they composed the polar opposites of what the West unironically called the Cold War, as fought between the USA and USSR. But the synthesis was the recognition that this war had been extremely hot for us Asians, and Africans, and Latin Americans. Seeing the failures of both communism and anticommunism, I chose nothing…There was a 5 page discussion of the infinite orifice of the toilet and anus, there was seemingly 20 pages full stream of consciousness no breaks or punctuation violent altercation that was so strange and yet so authentic to what it might be like to be in the fight (or at least for our highly frenetically thinking protagonist)... WEIRD but also well done? There are so many layers of interaction between individuals and nations that are in the whirling narrative of The Committed, and it can give you whiplash how many ideas are being thrown at you amidst the series of unfortunate events and super strange set pieces Nguyen is setting up. This is a book that requires completely surrender: you give yourself over to Nguyen's brain and words and settle into the guise of our protagonist, or you'll find yourself highly confused and need to reorient constantly.I think Nguyen is a hell of a writer - he has shown quite a range across his novels and short stories - although he can fixate and get repetitive at times, and the emotional impact he (I think) intended seemed blunted in comparison to the literary tricks, intellectual bits, and wordplay games. But overall this was fun, freewheeling and thought provoking. I LOVED Nguyen's The Refugees (mildly uneven as a collection but with absolutely brilliant stories) but had started and dropped The Sympathizer (the squid sex turned me off and I wasn't expecting or appreciating at that moment the humor and breakneck, stream of consciousness narration). But my enjoyment of The Committed encourages me to try the first volume again. What an intelligent, bizarrely enjoyable time!

I'd probably be at 3.5 stars, but my final rating is 3 stars because while I liked it, there were a few things that didn't work for me (most importantly the romance) and I think this might have been a case of trying to do to much in one book. These Violent Delights is a retelling of Shakespeare's famous tragedy while also being somewhat a piece of historical fiction in 1920s Shanghai while also being a YA fantasy with supernatural l horror elements: I think if maybe only two of those things had been part of the focus, the pace would have been a bit better and other characters and ideas might have been able to be fully explored.Here's for me what worked, what was interesting if not fully developed, and where I think things could have been better.THE REALLY GOODThe Writing: Gong is a strong writer, and I found the narrative to be engaging, paced fairly well, and descriptive without being too purple or over the top (which I've found more often in YA than in some other genres). There are some things that might be overused - I think everyone is smiling, acting, or behaving ""tightly"" in this book - but Gong has a clear prose that helps move things along and makes it easy to read even when the book is at its most dense with ideas and plots.The Politics and Discussion of Colonialism and Racism: Gong does a great job laying out the physical space of Shanghai and how pieces of the city have been carved up by various foreign nations, and then how those lines are being blurred and redrawn in the 20s amidst a push by capitalists and communists from Britain, the U.S., and China. But she also tackles in small and large ways the colonialist project and white supremacy - Juliette's time in the U.S., her wealth and status and polyglot nature are still not enough to stop others from their ""surprise"" at her ""lack of accent"" or protect her from being viewed as other and spit at in the U.S., and meanwhile returning to Shanghai she's confronted with encroachment and the gobbling up of resources, space, and lives of the city in the name of foreign powers and capitalist and communist enterprises expanding their power and dominion. She is forced to confront and fight against these things at every turn but still walk a line to preserve her family AND somewhat behave in accordance with the customary view of women in 1920s Shanghai. Gong takes things further by adding critiques of colorism within Shanghai society - it didn't seem like a coincidence that Rosalind and Kathleen referenced to have ""brown"" skin and contrasting it with Juliette's ""luck""to have been born white and pale because it directly ties into Rosalind and Kathleen's acceptance into the Cai family as somewhat in but also outside and lower ranked in the family and gang. Gong's ability to shed light on the appropriative, destructive and dehumanizing aspects of colonialism while also indict some of the racism within Chinese society is well done, especially considering everything else at play in the novel that this is worked into.THE GOODJuliette Cai: Gong gives us a badass heroine to root for in Juliette Cai, a bit of a departure from Juliet but in the most welcome way. This Juliette is fierce: she's the heir to the leadership of the Scarlet Gang and has to balance between those that recognize her birthright and those that might prefer following the lead of a male heir (Tyler/Tybalt who serves as a foil for Juliette, another welcome development and more on that below), so her smarts, knowledge and fine upbringing are always on display and she must use her ruthlessness and willingness to engage in violence to get what she needs or inspire fear and loyalty when challenged. There's maybe some things about Juliette that were written a bit flimsily - like the number of times she is coldly smiling and being polite and sweet while also shooting off verbal barbs, or the number of the times her viciousness and lethality is a surprise to those opposite her which seemed farfetched considering she's the heir to the gang AND has a repuation she cultivated that precedes her - but she's dynamic, complicated, interesting. And she feels and we feel her pull to be loyal to and save her family, as well as her love for Roma, and how she makes decisions to balance those two things is pretty compelling.The Cai Extended Family and the Scarlets: Tyler Cai and Kathleen Lang are two solid expansions or additions to the R&J storyline (in very different ways). Tyler is Tybalt, and he's definitely more along the lines of the Baz Lurhmann super violent Tybalt than the ""West Side Story"" retelling version of Bernardo. But while his violent, ruthless, creepy character is perhaps a bit reductive, Gong makes him relevant by setting him up as a foil not to Roma but to Juliette. Tyler is a direct threat to her status as heir: he wants control and power (and to a lesser extent to preserve the Cai family and their position in Shanghai), and eliminating or discrediting Juliette is the only way he'd be able to leapfrog her. So Tyler's actions and approaches to situations force Juliette into reactive choices and decisions, she has to stay one step ahead and when she doesn't, she has to pivot in order to stay on top (and stay alive). It doesn't necessarily make Tyler the most compelling character in his own right, but it definitely makes him an integral part of the narrative here and he adds to the dramatic tension well.Kathleen Lang is an addition - there's no clear link I could see between her character and an R&J role, especially since Nurse is mentioned - but is a great character in her own right as well as serving to show how those slightly lower in the Scarlet pecking order are affected by the politics and tensions in loyalty. Kathleen is trans and her family is related to Lady Cai, so she's part of the family but not fully and is somewhat of an outsider (which from her own perspective is doubled by being trans and guarding that fact from larger knowledge). She's willing to put herself in danger and seek information, and smart and interested in the churn of politics and society, but she's also calm, steady and kindhearted, a pacifist by nature. She's adapted and adopted traits from Juliette and Rosalind to get what she needs and to avoid detection when needed, but what she wants most is to live in peace: she plays the game to ensure her survival and a good life for herself. Kathleen and Juliette are perhaps closer than Kathleen and Rosalind, despite the latter being her sister and them being triplets. Juliette's automatic, easy acceptance of Kathleen and protection of her, not just of her being trans but of her being a Lang and not a Cai, forces Kathleen to grapple occasionally with loyalty to her cousin and loyalty to the gang, but ultimately synthesizing both: she wants Juliette as head of the family and gang, fear Tyler's reckless violence and hate as opposed to Juliette's calculated ruthlessness. I'd hope the next book has more Kathleen in it!We similarly get a good sense of the Cai dynamics as both a family and a gang, and how those two identities intersect. Rosalind especially makes reference to the insecurity of her and Kathleen's position within the family and the gang: they are Cais by association, related to Lady Cai who married into the family, not given positions of much prominence in the gang. For Rosalind there's a suggestion but no full development of tension with Juliette - Gong appears to be going in a different direction than R&J where Rosaline was Romeo's prior object of obsession without real love (although it's possible there's extra backstory there we'll get in the next book), and I'd guess (view spoiler)[Rosalind's fear, insecurity and tension with Juliette will either reveal her to be the spy for the White Flowers OR align her fully with Tyler (hide spoiler)] but that's probably to be seen in the next book. Gong's Cai family is secretive, powerful yet imperiled by these encroaching colonialist, capitalist and communist powers, and their loyalties and intrigue were handled well.WHAT DIDN'T WORKInstalove Disguised by Old Flames: I'm not sure if this is a YA trend or not (I just read another forthcoming YA book Lore with a similar romance set up that was similarly irritating) but grounding a romance in a previous connection between the characters, friendship to romance or just romance, ISN'T a replacement for showing us the strength and depth of that connection in the past OR in the present of the narrative! Just because the author has told us that they used to be in love, doesn't mean we as the reader feel or believe it. In the case of These Violent Delights, we are told many, many times that Roma and Juliette met as young adolescents or teens and got to know each other and fell in love, and then were separated by violent betrayal and distance (Juliette being sent off to the U.S.). But we really don't ever see their relationship or its development in the past. So in the present narrative, we see the tension and anger and confusion Juliette has regarding Roma, and yet by time the tension is overcome and the romance between them begins, it doesn't feel momentous or like an authentic development or something we as the reader have longed for or been rooting for, it just kind of happens. That's an unfortunate let down for a book that is a retelling of one of the more famous romantic tragedies in literature.What's all the more ironic to me is that the source material Romeo and Juliet is itself an instalove play, it may be THE instalove literary example. There's no build up, no past connection, we are at the Capulet party, Romeo sees her and we hop right into ""Did my heart love til now?"" and ""Good pilgrim"" and balcony scene of dreams. So Gong's choice to root the relationship beyond yet give us little showing of the actual romance and swoony mushy stuff whether in the past or or in the present a) departs from the source material in a way that adds no value and b) I would argue detracts because the romance here stands up so unfavorably to the play and ends up being even thinner and less believable instalove.Roma and the Montagovs: Relatedly to the earlier point, most of the novel is in the third person perspective of Juliette or the Cais, but Roma and his Montagov associates - most notably Marshall/Mercutio and Benedikt/Benvolio - have some chapters and POVs. Gong's choice is a great inversion from the play, where the Montague perspective and focus on Romeo is weighted more there, but it does leave us as the reader not really getting to know Roma and certainly not with the same depth and understanding that we get with Juliette or Kathleen. Which again impacts how much we care and are invested in their love story. The Montagov side characters are similarly given shorter shrift: the tense power struggle scenes that Juliette gets with Tyler are barely replicated between Roma and Dimitri and his father, and the creation of Roma's sister Alisa seems solely designed to imperil a Montagov for the sake of the monster subplot.The Ending / Splitting Into Two Books: The ending pretty much came out of nowhere IMO. Just as the romance seemed to be getting started and being shown to us instead of told, we hit the climax and seemingly history repeats itself (no spoilers). I did not know going in that this would split Romeo and Juliet into two books - I figured this was the start of a universe and new plots would spin off after concluding the R&J retelling here - and rather than being left wanting more, I was confused and irritated. Romeo and Juliet isn't Shakespeare's longest tragedy, it's of pretty average length, so cutting it in half and ending not on a cliffhanger but a weird pseudo resolution felt odd. And I think this had to be done because so many things were going on in this book that there wasn't enough room or it would stretch to 600 pages or something, but at least not expecting it going in, I was caught off guard in a negative way: my ""where is the rest?"" wasn't said out of desire or need to finish or I've got to see where this is going, but more akin to ""huh, that ended weirdly and flatly.""The Monster Subplot: So for me, the political machinations and discussion of the intersection of colonialism, racism, nationalism, sovereignty in 1920s Shanghai were EXCELLENT! The romance was lukewarm and not entirely developed. This monster subplot thing - which did tie into the politics and all - while being suitably creepy and exploitative, felt unnecessary and to me at least supplanted space the romance deserved and needed, but was occupied by these added fantastical elements. Had the fantasy/horror bits been taken out and the romance more fully developed, I think it would have been a stronger book AND a more interesting retelling of R&J.Ultimately for me with retellings, I'm looking at what the author was able to make their own, what parts of the original were emphasized and preserved or improved upon, and what original ideas, characters or settings were brought into the equation. These Violent Delights hits high marks in some places, especially in terms of representation (Juliette as a more fully fleshed out heroine, Kathleen as a transwoman secondary but still important character, the Cais being the focal POVs of the story) and the setting in 1920s Shanghai, along with the discussion of the interconnected politics and feuds based on nationality and ethnicity that go beyond the original Capulet v Montague dichotomy. But it failed to fully show or make me care about the romance and about Roma, and if you can't be invested in the star crossed lovers it's harder to fully invest in the book as a whole. I'll definitely be interested in Gong's future work especially if she moves into adult genres, and I might lightly recommend this to lovers of YA seeking own voices stories. Despite its flaws, it's readable and there's some good stuff going on, and I did like it. But I don't think I need or care to read the sequel....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Oct 31, 2020","Nov 02, 2020","Sep 22, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50892212-these-violent-delights

In a familiar tale of advance reader's copies, I had downloaded Black Sun two months earlier, randomly saw that my ARC was expiring and figured the cover looks cool, it's fantasy based on and featuring the indigenous Americas, I'll give it a go before it disappears forever from my app. When I got to the end of the ARC, I swiped and was disappointed, enraged: how could there be no more pages RIGHT NOW?!? Rebecca Roanhorse, you built this world, created these characters I increasingly came to care for or be very curious about, set all the machinations in motion, and then left me on the precipice of I don't know what but something EPIC? And yet, I was thrilled, satisfied, JAZZED. Black Sun... Wow, what a start to a series! I think my rating is probably 4.5 stars, but I rounded it up to 5 stars for being entirely impressed with and admiring of Roanhorse's craft, ideas, and world building, plus having so much FUN getting into this story and meeting these characters. And I don't often find myself desperately swiping my iPad hoping more pages will materialize at the end of an ARC, so the leave 'em wanting more test was met and blown away!The book is set on the Meridian continent (could have used a map in the ARC but I think it's in the print book and on the book's website) and is set primarily in Tova, the holy city home to Sun Priests, assassins, secret cults and a political and social tension between the elevated ministry of the four clans. A total eclipse of the sun, an auspicious time generally but here the springboard for prophecy and destiny to arrive, sets the mood of adventure and the consideration of the range of cultural, social, and religious views held by the peoples and societies of Meridian. The main POV characters Roanhorse follows - Xiala, Serapio, Naranpa (and a lesser extent Okoa) - are all moving through and to Tova and their choices, actions, desires put them on a collision course. Roanhorse invests her storytelling wisely: I can't entirely predict where over the course of the series alliances, allegiances, and interpersonal relationships may go, and those decisions really intertwine and drive the movements of the plot. Roanhorse gives us a wealth of detail about the world without too much info dumping, and has a clear and occasionally lyrical style of prose while being mostly straightforward and clear in her descriptions. I think one standout example was the bonding of Xiala and Serapio on their journey across the Crescent Sea. Roanhorse gave us some scene-chewing descriptions of sailing at night, life on board with the crew and spotlighted Xiala's Teek abilities and the myths and truths of Teek culture, but also laid out the increasing intimacy between the two and slow unfolding of Serapio's character. And any of the flashbacks to Serapio's training were ominous, deep, dark, helping us fill in gaps on the pseudo-legendary gone and yet not Carrion Crow cult and yet also providing tremendous pathos and understanding for Serapio.Besides the storytelling and world building, in a moment where diversity and representation in literature is paramount and prominent not only in the characterization on the page but also in the persons wielding the pen er computers and creating the work (and also in the bookselling industry itself but that seems to be coming slower), Black Sun to me stands out both for being a great example of writer and work diversity and representation but, more importantly, seemingly executed NATURALLY, easily, flawlessly. (I say seemingly not to minimize what I'm sure was a lot of labor on the part of Roanhorse). To some degree, Roanhorse's novel fits into the existing counter narrative demonstrating great fantasies CAN be set in worlds beyond those inhabited by tall, mostly blond but some brunette, white humans and elves with Latin or Celtic or whatever magic based systems. Black Sun places us in a fictional world based on the indigenous Americas and even if some elements are less immediately familiar to a casual reader of fantasy, as those tropes have been utterly absorbed into entertainment culture, Roanhorse is great at grounding the reader in things that may be new while not over-explaining or stripping down her ideas and concepts and making them palatable to that accustomed audience. She truly ""shows"" and doesn't tell. The other key point re representation that is done leaps and bounds better in Black Sun than I've seen elsewhere is expressing the spectrum of sexual and gender identity, as well as centering a POV on Serapio, who is blind. Characters simply ARE who they are, a range of pronouns are employed (xe/xir) with little fanfare and are seamlessly included. Roanhorse gives her subjects the space, freedom, time and attention to have the portions of their sexual and gender identities be brought up in the context of developing personality and plot, giving us representation without sacrificing storytelling. It seems as though in many cases in modern fiction, authors can be willfully or obtusely ignorant of representation and making characters homogeneously cis and straight and abled. As a counter, other authors confront this issue head-on which is laudable but do so in ways that could seem to diminish their characters: reducing them to stereotype, maybe filling a quota or checking a box, or writing the characters in such polemical ways it interferes with the narrative and storytelling. Roanhorse's characters, especially Xiala, Serapio, and Naranpa and Ikan and their relationship, are living beings where their identities are represented and representative and important their actions and motivations BUT they are and can be other things in the story. I haven't read anything by Roanhorse before, but I cannot wait to read the rest of her work. Black Sun is a bravura performance and I cannot recommend it highly enough to people who love fantasy but are looking for something different, new, fresh and executed at the highest levels of craft and quality. And I cannot WAIT for the next book, or a novella, or just a few sneak peek pages, or a blog post, or whatever Roanhorse provides us because THAT CLIFFHANGER!...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Oct 11, 2020","Oct 13, 2020","Sep 22, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50892360-black-sun

Danforth was extraordinarily ambitious and I give her tremendous credit for coming up with the multiple forms of media all surrounding each other in the novel: the book by Mary McClane that the Brookhants Plain Bad Heroines are moved by and the adults react to in various ways, the book by Merritt Weaver that explains (some of) the happenings of 1902 at Brookhants, and the modern movie script and attempted documentary behind the movie that Audrey, Merritt and Harper are all involved in creating or are being created by. There's an entire strain of thought in the book about girls and women defining for themselves who they are, finding voices and power and identity free from constraint of either 1902 or present day forms of oppression and silencing over women. I genuinely found some portions - especially in the sections that revolved around the Brookhants students or Libbie and Alex - to be beautifully drawn, giving us depth of character and the trials and tribulations of loving women set in 1902 and on a boarding school campus. And some of the bits of horror were EXTREMELY creepy and disturbing, so Danforth has a way with atmosphere.But it was uneven in terms of execution. Because the plot line jumped around in time and between the two timelines of book + movie Harper, Audrey, Merritt and 1902 Libbie and Alex (with some girls of Brookhants thrown in), it feels as though it takes a long time to get to the meat of what the happenings at Brookhants actually were, and even then there are so many ideas introduced but not fully explored I'm still not entirely sure what did or didn't happen and I definitely wasn't sure why. I personally was not interested in Harper Harper's movie star of everyone's fantasies or Merritt's acerbic, standoffish, jealous writer: Audrey was a blank slate and a bit of a cipher. So each time Danforth switched to the ""present"" day, I was irritated to spend time with this group of characters when we could have been immersed in the gothic horror and unfolding mystery and tragedy of Brookhants. And it didn't help that the narration device Danforth used made the whole book feel a bit YA to me: as mentioned above the narrator is too knowing and highlighting tragedies to come but in a way that felt sometimes bratty and obnoxious. The narrator wasn't enhancing my enjoyment of the story, but getting in the way of my immersion and drawing my attention in ways I didn't think were helpful, informative, or entertaining. And the ending... I would re-read it so I could actually figure out what was and was not happening, but that would be too much work for a book that I struggled to get through at times for what I imagine to be very little payoff: again, brand new ideas were inserted, characters suddenly became relevant with not enough backstory, and some of the mystery was stripped away in favor of other fantastical elements that I felt were less interesting choices by Danforth. (I'm being as vague as possible, dear Readers, to avoid spoilers but also because I was so confused and annoyed by the ending).I think I'm ultimately rounding up from 2.5 stars to be 3 stars because even with its many issues, flaws, and irritating qualities, this was a really original, interesting, atmospheric concept and Danforth was able to write some parts really well. I did really like a lot of Plain Bad Heroines, but the inconsistency, throwing shit at the wall ending, and too many ideas left without sufficient support made it hard to rate higher than 3 stars. I probably wouldn't recommend it to many people without giving a thorough breakdown of its strengths and weaknesses and I DEFINITELY would not read it again. But in keeping with the book, I'd love to watch a period piece miniseries or read more self-contained stories set in 1902 about Brookhants....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Sep 28, 2020",Oct 2020,"Sep 16, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50496875-plain-bad-heroines

A year later in this book, everAt the end of Mistborn: The Final Empire, the heist that sparked the revolution is over and a new world order emerged. A year later in this book, everything is going to hell in a handbasket.Middle novels in trilogies can be tricky: you’ve got to build on the success of the first book that set the scene and introduced you to characters and did exciting things; leave things ready for the last book where the plotlines and character progressions will converge and heroes will likely rise, fall, and rise again; AND be an entertaining, meaningful entry on its own, otherwise it’s filler with no meaning. The Well of Ascension is a pretty damn good sequel, a terrific set up novel for the climactic conclusion (why I am I even writing this , I must read The Hero of Ages: Book Three of Mistborn NOW!), and was enjoyable enough as its own thing.Here's the setup with no spoilers: the crew at the end of The Final Empire is back/still in Luthadel - Vin, Sazed, Elend, Ham, Clubs, Spook, Dockson, Breeze - and preparing to defend the city from, well, everyone. Meanwhile we are introduced to new or expanded characters who may be allies, enemies, or some mixture of the two, and there's a traitor in the midst. Oh and on top of that a few characters are hearing things, a few characters are seeing things, and the mist may or may not be killing people. How much more tension do we need? Add in the strain of interpersonal relationships, political intrigue, responsibility for the city's most vulnerable citizens, and still dealing with the death of Kelsier (I'm still not over it even though I love how Sanderson has his characters still wrestling with it) and the cult that springs up after him, and we've got a recipe for a dramatic, action and chatacter development packed, EPIC second book in this series.Perhaps the biggest surprise for me was how much I really enjoyed Vin as the heroine and loved seeing her growth in this book. I hadn't warmed up to Vin that much in The Final Empire as some of her teen angst and fear I found irritating, her romance with Elend I found boring, and her suddenly superpowered status I found predictable and boring. But in The Well of Ascension, Vin is still wrestling with who she is and wants to be, but she has more and more well-rounded personality, confidence, we see her testing the limits of her powers and confronting the multitudes of her nature as a woman and a Mistborn, and how to position herself - for her, for Elend and the city, for the skaa and people, for Kelsier. I had been worried that without Kelsier, I'd have less interest in the characters, but Vin became the reason I read and I finally appreciated just how great of a heroine she was. Elend I certainly enjoyed more in this book watching him grapple with having his ideals tested in reality and figuring out how to lead, but I overall preferred Vin's scenes with the kandra and with Zane to hers with Elend: I'm still not invested or interested in their relationship and I like the two of them better independently. Some of the new and expanded characters are interesting, and we get some time with them. The kandra (and yes I am being vague for a reason) was FABULOUS: fascinating development and really pushed Vin forward as a character, although I would have liked more space for the kandra as their own character too (but hopefully that's coming). Zane for me was a standout, another Mistborn in the mix, a flipside to Elend and a tension and connection with Vin, darkness but also mixed motivations and intentions. And to go a little spoilery and theory diving for a second: (view spoiler)[Zane is clearly not dead right??? His father thinks he is not, and he has that spike thingy in his chest (which was ""God"" talking to him, which I now think is whatever was trapped in the Well) that seems to be his weak spot a la the Inquisitors... is Zane some kind of hybrid Inquisitor-Mistborn, an Inquisitborn? (hide spoiler)]. Other characters I wished we had more time with - Allrianne I definitely thought was underutilized especially considering the mild twist to her character, but hopefully there's more to come with her story. And Breeze had some great moments in this book, a little less for Ham and Clubs but still present, but there was very little Spook or Dockson time unfortunately.There is A LOT going on in this book, and perhaps the reason I'm at 3.5 rounded up to 4 stars rather than 5 is because I think the pacing is a little off, and because certain plots are raised and then dropped in ways that didn't fit the characterization. In terms of pacing, I really enjoyed the political intrigues and Vin investigations, Sazed explorations, and Elend doing Princess Diaries Cosmere style with Tindwyl, but it definitely felt like the first half dragged a little bit. Once it hit maybe Part Three though, we were off like a rocket and I could barely put the book down as Sanderson pushed his characters and plots to their climactic conclusions and cliffhangers. ""I AM FREE!"" Most of the time those are words I'd love to read; here I am really freaked out to find out what exactly that means for our heroes. And then in terms of plots, I noted this earlier but in contrast to how well Sanderson had the characters reflecting on Kelsier's role in getting them to this point and navigating how they felt about the man and his mission now, there was almost no reflection AT ALL near the end of the novel after major character deaths (with one noteworthy exception). And yes granted there were constant hijinks and perilous threats still occurring (view spoiler)[Marsh where the HELL did you come from?!? Also pet theory linking Marsh and Zane that the spiked beings somehow have been commandeered or have to do with the free thing from the Well (hide spoiler)] but still, in the epilogue? Somewhere? They deserved that much at least. Another weirdly not dealt with element was (view spoiler)[Vin killing Zane and him being Elend's brother: so she kills him and then she and Elend just get married and Elend knows it was his brother and has almost nothing more to say? Even though he knew she had hid her following Zane and sparring with him and her being drawn to him the whole book? I mean, what? (hide spoiler)] and I didn't find Sanderson's resolution believable at all.BUT saving this from 3 stars IMO, this book does not belong entirely to Vin and Elend: it also belongs to Sazed. And for me, Sazed's incredible personal journey combined with uncovering the true mystery of the Well of Ascension was an absolute standout. Sazed has so many great moments, pushes himself to and past his limits as a Keeper and Terrisman, and then experiences so many and such deep losses in the book's climax... Sanderson really turned the pathos up and I FELT IT. Sazed's position as pseudo-steward, mentor and wise man from The Final Empire isn't dispensed with entirely but he is able to really grow, question, be more than what he was. And his fate at the end of The Well of Ascension along with what we've gathered about the Synod and the Terris people makes me think we are in for a brand new, bold arc for Sazed come the final volume. (view spoiler)[This is me guessing that Sazed is indeed the real hero of the ages (not that that prophecy is real necessarily) and will be going toe-to-toe with whatever came out of the Well and with the Steel Inquisitors who destroyed the Keepers, both out of duty but also as potentially vengeance for Tindwyl (hide spoiler)].At any rate, a really fun, slightly slow but eventually propulsive entry in the Mistborn series, heartily recommended, and I cannot wait to finish the series!...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Oct 25, 2020","Oct 29, 2020","Aug 31, 2020",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/41080760-the-well-of-ascension

And I am really glad he did! He loaned me his copy of The Final Empire, and by the time I was flying through the last 100 pages, anxiously and excitedly flipping the pages and somewhat dreading the ending, I had ordered the boxed set from bookshop and am rapidly refreshing the shipping info so I can dive into The Well of Ascension expeditiously. I'm landing at a solid 4 stars: I really enjoyed this read and this felt like both a great standalone novel as well as a kickoff to an entire world I long to know more about, but it didn't immediately leap into my top, best-ever fantasy ranks, which is of course incredibly subjective. And since this book has been very well-covered with s, I'll keep my points shorter and hopefully explain what I loved and what I felt was perhaps a bit weaker, but still didn't diminish my enthusiasm.HIGHLIGHTSApproachability: Sanderson makes it SO EASY to dive into the world of Scadrial. I don't think I've read a fantasy novel that was written so clearly and straightforwardly while providing a rich atmosphere and for the reader an immediate context to the world we're encountering. Many fantasy writers employ language as either an added force or a crutch to their worldbuilding; while Sanderson does introduce a brand new system of magic that has its own vocabulary, the descriptive prose and dialogue is very straightforward and composed in contemporary English. I found this to be really compelling, as I can be someone who loves all the high fantasy ye olde language trappings, and yet I was very much captured and engrossed anyway.Magic: ALLOMANCY, it's awesome! A form of magic I never encountered or thought of, seemed entirely new, and it was well explained and shown off in ways that didn't involve too many paragraphs of exposition. Rather, Sanderson had Vin getting informal tutoring from all of the Misting masters in their metal of expertise, so we got more insight into their characters as well as some more dynamic, active scenes as Vin explores her powers. I always want to know more about the magic of given world, and it was great that within this first book Sanderson grounds us in the system but also paves the way for more in depth questions and mysteries to solve.Characters: Sanderson created some really fabulous characters in The Final Empire, and I was somewhat surprised just how much I cared for them and how quickly. For me, the shining examples were Sazed and Kelsier. I found Sazed to be my Uncle Iroh for the ATLA fans, A Terrisman and Keeper, filled with knowledge, wisdom, kindness, but also one of only a few of his kind and possessing vast and different power all his own that contains its own set of mysteries (view spoiler)[deepened by the revelations at the end of the novel (hide spoiler)]. And then Kelsier straddles the line between human/Skaa and Mistborn, man and legend, optimistic, daring thief and dark, haunted, murderous revolutionary BRILLIANTLY. I could not get enough of him, and that's a strong testament to Sanderson's ability as an author.Pacing: Sanderson knows when to pick up the pace, and DOES HE! Just when I was starting to maybe get a little antsy with all the balls and spycraft and Allomancy tutelage, Sanderson shifted the story into gear and suddenly we were hurtling into a multipart climax. And again his straightforward language here was an added benefit, calling up increased stakes and anxiety and horror and excitement of the situation and the characters readily and easily. The last third of the book I read at a breakneck pace to keep up with the atmosphere Sanderson had created, I needed to follow that pacing and know what happened!SOME MIXED FEELINGSPlot: This is maybe an odd flip side to my admiration for the pacing, but even while I was racing ahead to see what happened and appreciated Sanderson's twists and surprises, I was never truly surprised? I'm not sure if the plot is pretty basic/archetypal of fantasy or if I've just read enough of these books and watched films to make pretty educated guesses, but I felt like some elements were telegraphed early and maybe too often, so even though I couldn't wait to read it, I wasn't surprised by some of the plot developments. Even the mysterious little intros to each chapter, I unwound fairly quickly and correctly interpreted to whom they belonged and what it might mean. And at least one major twist/plot point, I saw coming very early and yet was hoping Sanderson would make like George R.R. Martin and ""subvert my expectations""(view spoiler)[KELSIER, NO! WHY? ARGHHHHHH. Not only did I predict his death, but there were even enough breadcrumbs to not be surprised by how/why he planned it. So it was doubly sad/dispiriting. (hide spoiler)]. I could see it coming AND I understood the author's choice to move the plot that way AND it fits in with some of the traditional journeys of (especially young or teen) main characters in fantasy novels, but foreknowledge does not stave off disappointment and execution of the familiar plots is key. I felt Sanderson did this mostly pretty well, but it wasn't entirely satisfying or novel. Which leads me to my other main nitpick...Vin:. Don't get me wrong I liked Vin, she's complicated, feisty yet introverted, betrayed and yet able to heal and find faith and love in others. She has a backstory that we've gotten some degree of understanding of but also has many more mysteries surrounding her and I'm excited to explore more of those in the books to come, and she does have a pretty strong arc of growth even only in the first novel. YET I was not overly fond of the (view spoiler)[romance with Elend, who despite being bookish (yay) is as boring to watch as paint drying IMO (hide spoiler)], and the seeming speed and carelessness to which Vin approaches it/him seemed somewhat out of character, especially when juxtaposed her care and caution in coming to trust Kelsier, Sazed and the crew. And she is a teenager with a hard, broken past so I definitely gave her some space for that, but it could be wearying sometimes reading from her perspective which could be juvenile, petty, irritating, when we could have had more from Kelsier or Sazed or Breeze or even Clubs (more Clubs! I love his ability and crankiness) and Spook. And I LOVE a good heroine so it confuses me that I connected more or was interested more in the male characters, but here we are. (view spoiler)[And I'm just slightly trepidatious to go off adventuring with Vin as the focal point, I'm not sure her character is built enough for/liked enough by me yet and I mourn having Kelsier as a fantastic co-lead and older Mistborn foil to her role. (hide spoiler)] But I am still eager to take the next steps with her and see where Sanderson takes things!Ultimately, I recommend this enthusiastically for fantasy fans, and I am looking forward to finishing the trilogy and getting more of Sanderson's world!...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Aug 16, 2020","Aug 22, 2020","Aug 31, 2020",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/40864775-mistborn

And it is becoming a pattern in that I find it hard to aRed Pill is the second of Kunzru’s books I’ve read; White Tears was my first. And it is becoming a pattern in that I find it hard to assess and evaluate the novel and my reading experience after I finish Kunzru’s work, and also that my evaluation changes over time. I started writing this  mildly ambivalent about the book, enjoying its cleverness and meditations but feeling flat emotionally and left with a need for greater coherence and climactic payoff, but as I worked through my thoughts, my understanding and appreciation deepened for Kunzru’s craft, even of the things I liked less. The first half of the book for me was a bit less compelling for me and harder to read, but it was entirely necessary and the seeds planted sprout vines that descend throughout the text. We are introduced to the writer narrator, entering the Deuter Center for the writing fellowship facing a professional and existential crisis. The narrator is highly self-aware, and being in his head we vacillate between his selfishness, ego, insecurity, hunger for freedom, a heady mix that interacts with his depression and writer’s block. There are some interesting asides and anecdotes – the trip down memory lane into East Berlin and controlled life under Stasi was FASCINATING – but I could get wearied by some of the immersion into German literature and philosophy, although some of that was simply because I was less familiar with the references and it could break my focus to try and outside the text understand what was being referenced. One thing that I give enormous credit to Kunzru for in the first half is being able to slyly and obliquely plant thematic seeds in the first half that sprout in predictable yet still interesting ways in the back half. ""Red Pill"" as a title itself is spoiler to a degree, with all the modern, alt-right baggage that comes from the term and not simply meaning the ticket to freedom from its source The Matrix, but I appreciated that we could draw the lines from Kleist to Anton and the web woven round the narrator ourselves: Kunzru lays them out but deploys them softly rather than bluntly.The second half of the book starts by building on the groundwork of the plot and characters, and wrestles with concepts of masculinity and what it means to be a man, what space there is for men to experience depression, what men are or are not “allowed” to be, and and opens wider to some of the alt-right themes, although the way these ideas are dealt with could be a mixed bag at times. For example, there’s a recurring presence of a refugee father and his young daughter, who are held up as a foil to the narrator away at the Center and his own daughter at home. The narrator seems to focus on his failure to protect his daughter, and those feelings are magnified by watching Blue Lives, the aggressive cop show putting everyone in harm’s way and allowing horrendous violence and revenge to be taken by criminals and cops alike. Blue Lives is a fascinating device in and of itself – the cops are crooked and unsympathetic, yet have a code in which their violence is seemingly only exhibited on criminals and those involved in the underworld, while the brown criminals seem to be targeting civilians/women and children, though for the narrator it isn’t shown, just alarmingly and threateningly teased. Kunzru uses this as way to lead the narrator into Anton’s ideology and allow for being redpilled, that in this soft, modern world men have removed themselves from the primal and basic roles as protector and survivor for themselves and their families, and that in and of itself causes confusion and some form of illness that can be cured. And while the narrator rejects that in his head, it’s harder for him to refute in speech and the ideas (and Anton) takes some hold of him emotionally. But the father and daughter foil are less fleshed out than Blue Lives is for the narrator: these are simply brown, desperate foils with no ability to speak for themselves or in a larger way challenge the narrator’s assumptions, and I think that might have helped me appreciate the comparison AND perhaps on the plot side added to the unmooring of the narrator and demonstrate his further loosening hold on reality. Now, I know “comparison is the thief of joy” and all that, but I picked up Red Pill because I had had such an unsettling and memorable experience reading White Tears, and I was interested to see how another novel of his would work for me. I won’t get into explicit spoilers, although I think it’s somewhat less imperative in this case as there is seemingly less to spoil in the traditional sense. But Kunzru’s books, to keep things timely as Kunzru does, are in my view epitomized by the popular meme ""they had us in the first half, I'm not gonna lie"". There’s a divide for readers of White Tears as to whether the back half or third of the book makes or breaks the work, and I at least can see a similar thing happening for readers of Red Pill. For me at least, the second half is where Kunzru shows me WHY I am reading this book. This is where most of the grappling with his larger themes happen, where all the table setting of mildly boring details from the first half are woven in and pay off in dramatic and fantastical fashion, where Kunzru builds to a climax of ideas and action… except that doesn’t exactly happen in Red Pill. Or does it? The buildup is there and the mood is feverish and unsettling and thoughts are roaring through the narrator’s head and I read these pages in a similar fashion, but there’s not the same knockout punch at the end. Instead of the crescendo crashing over me, reading the end was more like a balloon being deflated. There was a letdown, a missed opportunity… and yet the more I think about it, the more I feel the deliberateness of Kunzru’s ending. That deflated balloon sound embodies the narrator’s disappointment in himself, his position in his new/old reality and how people are interacting with him. We go from the manic paranoia high of action and confrontation:The Apocalypse is the time when all secrets are revealed. By scrambling down towards the cliffs, I knew I was only postponing the moment when the bones of the dead would start up from the earth and I would be turned inside out like the victim of a medieval execution, my innards unspooled and put on display for the crowd. Privacy is the exclusive property of the gods. They see us, but we can never see them. We live like spies, always braced for exposure, while they remain a mystery. The sky was a helmet constricting my head; sweat dripped down my face. To:As I stand here at the kitchen counter and set out food for the party, I try to fill a bowl with olives normally. I try to open a package of crackers normally, to arrange a cheeseboard in the way a normal person should arrange a cheeseboard, without excessive precision or showiness, presenting the cheese according to some ordinary aesthetic standard, with the right level of care, neither too much nor too little, unwrapping the cheeses – a wheel of Brie, a wedge of Manchego, one of those expensive little goat cheeses that come wrapped in a vine leaf – just as a normal host would, someone for whom the meaning of these actions could never be in question.Despite the abrupt shift in tone, content, and pace, this passage really struck me and stayed with me, as it seemed to illustrate how the narrator finds even the most minute of tasks to be fraught with meaning and filled with traps that might show how not “normal” he is or is perceived to be. The scaring of people who love you, the fear and insecurity that then lurks in every interaction no matter how small, it’s a difficult space to occupy but even harder to get past or move on from. The emotional highs mirror the narrator’s own internal state, the ending is a letdown of sorts because that is where the narrator is and must be to function in the life he’s created for himself and wants. There’s a disturbing implication in there too, an unsaid question as to whether or not the redpill life isn’t in some way more free, more open, more amenable to emotion and interpretation and imagination. At one point, Kunzru takes the language of The Matrix and makes it even more present: the narrator explicitly thinks being home in New York to a technological construct (much like the bluepill world humans inhabit in the movie), which seems to compare negatively to the raw, lonely, “real” existence the narrator had on the island. And I think Kunzru’s intended or likely audience is able to of course reject that notion as the narrator does, but maybe push towards a less automatic and more examined idea of our choices, beliefs and the systems we subscribe to.While I didn’t love the placement in the timeline of the ending – (view spoiler)[ the election of Donald Trump and liberal fear and disappointment in the nation’s rejection of Hillary Clinton, a bit too on the nose if highly relevant to the topic  (hide spoiler)] - Kunzru ends on a note of both optimism and darkness, the narrator asserting his place in the world and his beliefs, while also acknowledging the fear and the danger presented. It's not much, but I can say that the most precious part of me isn't my individuality, my luxurious personhood, but the web of reciprocity in which I live my life.... Alone, we are food for the wolves. That's how they want us. Isolated. Prey. So we must find each other. We must remember that we do not exist alone.. For me, this book while not packing the wallop of White Tears, I couldn’t help but be impressed by Kunzru’s craft and was ultimately engaged and unsettled for days after. While I also was ambivalent about my feelings for this book, I think I will land on 3.5 stars, rounded up to 4 stars: this is a flawed book that I by turns found irritating and unsatisfying in parts, but Kunzru’s ability to tie it all together and keep me thinking about what I read speaks to its power....more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,"Aug 27, 2020","Aug 30, 2020","Jun 14, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/49188384-red-pill

I was unconvinced and not pulled in by the characters, cared little for the world Naomi Novik ""built"" through seemingly endless exposition, failed to feel like any kind of stakes or real fear/danger were set up despite the dark monster backdrop, and slogged with considerable effort through this read to get to the (mildly interesting with meh cliffhanger) ending. This is a 2 star read for me and that's probably even a generous one. I use the goodreads ratings description to rate books, and A Deadly Education was just ok, and it was ok like how eating a sandwich made up of two pieces of bread and a smear of butter is ok. If I’m hungry I’ll eat it and it’s edible, but it’s not a sandwich I like, love, dream of, crave, and it’s still a sandwich, just an unsatisfying one. My main issue is even though we are in dark magic school with dangerous monsters lurking about ready to devour, it feels as though NOTHING HAPPENS. Almost 85% of this book is exposition and info dumping. I wouldn’t even call it world building: to me that term invokes mastery and skill in weaving the details of the world into the plot, so we are learning about the environment in tandem with following the characters and their experiences; here it seemed like the “action” or what little there was of it would freeze and then paragraphs and paragraphs of backstory or detail would fill in. It was tedious and frequent, and it really inhibited my ability to immerse myself in Novik’s new universe.And maybe the long paragraphs describing some of the whats and the hows and the wheres of it all but not advancing the plot or characters much would be fine, if Novik had given us characters to pique our interest or let us truly feel the stakes of the story. But neither occurred. Even though we are in Galadriel/El’s point of view, I feel as though we never got to know her beyond her rude standoffish demeanor, hiding of her destructive powers, and irritation with the pseudo hero of the novel Orion Lake. Orion Lake is a sort of caring jock-ish invulnerable hero possibly hiding a secret all his own, but I was not MOVED or INTERESTED at all in what it might be. The classmates of El who orbit between enemies allies and maybe friends are lightly drawn and given minimal dialogue (what with the exposition taking up all the space). And let it be known that the so-called diversity trumpeted just feels like stand-in stock characters who are made to be ethnic minorities solely to say LOOK IT'S DIVERSITY, which I loathe. None of it felt authentic or meaningful.It’s also written in a manner that maybe made it harder for me to connect. It’s all first person from El’s perspective, so there’s teen angst and irritation and a breezy tone throughout. The problem is it just made it harder to engage and put a wall up between me and El, a hurdle to overcome to immerse in the world. I could at least read on the page that El had genuine fear of her powers getting out of control and of surviving another year, but I didn’t feel it... for a dark book about an undergoing school menaced by monsters there was very little in the way of atmosphere. I never really felt the characters dread or fear or eerie creepy feelings, or even their delight or power or sadness. It seemed like after every “dramatic” monster encounter they were all back in the lunch line and figuring out where people would sit in the cafeteria, a big whomp whomp. It was I suppose so regular for these kids to face and experience death that they didn’t emote much, but that didn’t make for very interesting reading overall. The predominant emotion was El’s disgust for Orion, a cover for sure for more complex emotions - we don’t really see but are told about - but it still permeated the feel of the read and threw me off balance.I might be one of the few ers thus far who knows Naomi Novik more from her very very long Temeraire series that kicked off with His Majesty's Dragon and stretched over a bunch of books (Uprooted has been on my to-read list for a mighty long time, and I'm not sure if A Deadly Education has hastened or destroyed my interest). While the Temeraire books were adult historical fiction meets fantasy, I stayed with the series for awhile until I discovered a sort of odd pattern past the first few books: one book of action, plot, and movement, and followed by one of immense info dumps and some character development but not a lot there there, plus a general decline in writing quality. A Deadly Education unfortunately falls into the trap that those less good Temeraire books are in: lots of ideas and maybe something cool in there, but little plot, little dynamism, and inspiring little feeling in the reader.To sum up again, it was ok. I went in with medium expectations - a dark school of magic, death and monsters lurking around the corner is a pretty easy sell - and endured an experience that let me down but in ways I couldn’t care less about. I was mostly bored and unsatisfied, I wouldn’t recommend it and I definitely won't continue the series BUT it wasn’t terrible and hopefully others will find the greatness in this book where I could not!...more",Notes are private!,0,37,1,"Aug 31, 2020","Sep 12, 2020","Jun 12, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50548197-a-deadly-education

But first, this biracial girl is going to stop crying, call her sister, hear her voice, rave about this book, and feel immense gratitude for having someone always to belong to and be part of me even as we make and recreate ourselves.-Now that I've had a chance to reflect and pass through the raw emotions this book prompted, I think I'll just dive straight into why this book hit me so hard, emphasizing the craft and technique that I admired, the force of the truths and observations Bennett made, and then the places I was most emotionally overcome. I've tried to keep things as spoiler free as possible and only refer to some major elements that occur in the early pages of the book: I didn't read any s going in and being uninitiated helped create that sense of magical discovery as I read. But if you like to know what to expect, I will hopefully shed some light!The book tackles really heavy issues in U.S. culture and in the Black community, some of which are now becoming more openly challenged (i.e. state violence against Black people) but some of which are still less familiar or thoroughly discussed outside of those places where the immediate damage is most prominently experienced (i.e. colorism). And for me, Bennett weaves these things throughout her story and indeed they animate the story, but they don't overwhelm the narrative: hers is a subtle hand despite the profoundly staggering effects of reading her prose about the lynchings of Black people and Black men most specifically, or the range of destruction created and caused by colorism.The trauma of violence rules against Black people hangs over all of the characters, their motivations and actions. Mallard is a town in Louisiana founded by light skinned Blacks, and at least some ancestors of the twins Stella and Desiree at the heart of the story were focused on continually intermarrying with lighter and lighter Blacks, making (in their devastatingly colorist verbiage) a more perfect Negro. A horrifying, wanton act of violence is visited on the twins' family early on, told in flashbacks that reverberate and echo throughout and inform how Stella and Desiree react to their town and plot their lives. For Desiree, it reveals the lie about Mallard, the idea that a lighter skinned Black person was set above and apart from other Black people, because none of that mattered when the white men came for him, so how could she care about lightness after that?. It pushes her towards finding new, broader ways to belong beyond the limits of pigment or shade that Mallard would enforce. For Stella, the same truth is exposed, but it is fear that drives her, a way to escape that and be free of the possible fate for Black people that awaited: a victim of violence at the hands of those with power for no particular reason other than they could. And that is tied of to the stark, insidious ways that colorism is in the fabric of society across place and time. Bennett shows its construction via white supremacy but also its pernicious absorption into the Black community, looking slightly different when employed across racial groups, but always exerting its ugly, false sorting and its weaponization. And Bennett demonstrates the illogic of colorism while still providing unanswered questions that provoked and gnawed at me when I read it, and still days later. For example, we're confronted with scenes of domestic partner violence, and at least of some characters reflect it's because Desiree disregarded the Mallard ""way"" of choosing light skinned partners and her husband, a dark skinned man, celebrated and resented her for her lightness and led him to beat her. But Bennett complicates this flawed analysis in a few ways: Desiree herself wonders if she fetishized Sam for his skin color, which is mirrored generally across people in the novel feeling attraction for those they are told not to be interested in, and Bennett explores how race and colorism influence and intersect with sexual and romantic attractions and interest. Additionally, Desiree feels some amount of compassion for him despite her refusing to stay and escaping with her daughter, as she puts it, thinking to herself: so he liked to throw his weight around a little. Who could blame him, living in a world that refused to respect him as a man? Finally throughout, Bennett makes a point of the intersectionality between race and gender. Desiree, Stella, Jude, Loretta, and other women of The Vanishing Half, are targeted in various ways because they are women AND because they are Black women, and they are preyed upon, harassed, subjected to the limitations of men white and Black, light and dark. The specific and collective trauma faced by Black women is too often unaddressed. Some of the truths and the questions that get raised by Bennett are uncomfortable or provocative, but should be spoken about and brought to light more, and even as it could be hard to read I appreciated all of the thoughts the book generated for me.There are as you might expect questions about what it means to be Black, to be white: is it self-identification, self-creation, is it blood and descent, is it what people see you as, is it what ""fits"" and you know or you don't? Stella the twin who vanished is the main fulcrum by which Bennett examines the various ways characters interact with what it means to be Black and white in the U.S. Desiree and Stella (and then later to a lesser extent Kennedy and Jude) serve as mirrors, both sets of mothers, daughters, sisters, cousins, longing and lonely, determining, deciding, and submitting to destiny where and who they will be. Bennett does this slowly, sometimes in more obvious ways - how Desiree and Stella each react to the births of their daughters - sometimes in more subtle ways - how Sam has to protect Desiree from angry youths in the wake of Martin Luther King's assassination and they cry together for the loss, both the specific and general, juxtaposed against Stella and Blake's chilly and shocked viewing of riots on the news, Blake framed as believing in a moderate country. What he wanted most, he always said, watching policeman club protestors on the news, was for everyone to get along. Brit uses mirrors and photography as ways to reflect how the twins have gone through processes of self-creation and growth, with some parallels later as their daughters consider themselves in mirrors, in photos, on stages, but for Stella and Kennedy there's a constant yearning for freedom and a cycle of continuous dissatisfaction and rebirth, whereas Desiree and Jude seek and find stability and create without drastic severance of self. Bennett doesn't land any one place but she gives you a lot of material to consider your own thoughts.There are so many small moments and turns of phrase that grabbed me, and were sly, funny, moving, enraging. And I truly felt enormous pathos reading about these characters, even and especially Stella, who was the most complicated, cruel and destructive, yet still managed to break my heart and have my heart break for her multiple times. And Bennett wrote this set from the 1950s to the 80s and 90s, but as our characters learn and know and we see daily, we don't escape our pasts easily and as a society and culture, we don't change rapidly and true freedom, inclusion, belonging comes extremely slowly. And yet Bennett's book, written and published before the murder of George Floyd, seems to presage how things can and do change. She writes: Important men became martyrs, unimportant ones victims. The important men were given televised funerals, public days of mourning. Their deaths inspired the creation of art and the destruction of cities. But unimportant men were killed to make the point that they were unimportant – that they were not even men – and the world continued on.. We're in a moment now where the formerly unimportant are important, where this dichotomy is turned on its head, where there's some equalizing of recognition and worth in death, and now all we must do is get that equality in our lives. The Vanishing Half won't tell us how to accomplish that, but at least for me it spurred discussion and deconstruction of my own ideas and beliefs, interrogation of intersectionality and understanding, while also giving me well-written prose to get swept away in and characters to root for while being sometimes aghast yet empathetic at their words and actions. And I really truly hope The Vanishing Half can give all of this to you too!...more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,"Oct 20, 2020","Oct 23, 2020","Jun 12, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51791252-the-vanishing-half

Susanna Clarke’s Piranesi is a short - I read it feverishly in a few hours - but multilayered little novel that wound up being far more emotionally touching than I anticipated. I read Piranesi and found myself immediately discombobulated, lost and immersed in a world I had little understanding of. Clarke’s initial perspective, Filled with Odd and seemingly Random Capitalizations, helped to foment that feeling of being tossed upon rough literary waves. But similar to being caught in a riptide, I knew it was better to simply surrender and I started to float upon Clarke’s words, and let the narrative take me where she willed. And I suppose reading Piranesi at this time, when I myself am highly disconcerted, challenged, and full of feeling in an urgent moment in the world, the narrator’s strangeness and his World’s strangeness resonated strongly with me, as did his drive to understand and seek truth and justice or fairness. ""‘Why a labyrinth, do you suppose?’…. ‘A vision of cosmic grandeur, I suppose. A symbol of the mingled glory and horror of existence. No one gets out alive.’” The book’s description is clear that a labyrinth is involved, and I won’t spoil anything about the plot specifically. But the novel is also a labyrinth, a massive puzzle in not so many pages, and Clarke has given the reader and the narrator a ball of string to ascend and descend throughout the layers of the work. Loss, loneliness, greed, power, devotion, subjugation, memory, perspective, imagination, reason, belief all swirl about as the narrator begins to follow the threads in the story and we the reader put the pieces together. ""Perhaps that is what it is like being with other people. Perhaps even people you like and admire immensely can make you see the World in ways you would rather not.”I’ll also note I am enormous fan of Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell: I read it annually and its beautiful use of language and detailed alternate history are two of the reasons I appreciate it so. These two books are in no way comparable, so I recommend you don't go in looking for Jonathan Strange pt II. Yet Clarke hasn’t lost her touch and is a great storyteller even in a wildly different setting. In Piranesi, we are treated to a simple, blunt, yet gentle narrative style, but with the fantastical properties that give the book a hazy, mythic feel throughout. It’s great craftsmanship to create the atmosphere, and Clarke knows precisely when to pierce it in the narrative. The mourning, exultation and calm the narrator experiences in later parts are amplified by this atmosphere, so that I as the reader felt these things for the narrator but also for myself as the read itself transformed.Piranesi is bold, beautiful, odd, and left me wanting a bit more while also feeling highly satisfied and eager for new literary worlds; and to revisit old ones. (view spoiler)[ There are more than a few nods to Narnia and The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe throughout, which if you’re familiar could cause you to solve some of the mystery a bit ahead of schedule. Perhaps the cutest and most obvious allusion was the narrator’s strong and innate affection for the Statue of the Faun in the House: I dreamt of him once; he was standing in a snowy forest and speaking to a female child. (hide spoiler)] I went with 4.5 stars and rounded to 4 stars because I’m not sure it immediately vaulted to my best of all-time list. But I’ll read it again, and we will see how it grows and changes in my heart down the line. And I know, as it’s written in the pages of the novel, once you have found the door, it is always with you. You simply look for it and there it is. Piranesi helped me open the door back up to reading and finding once again the humanity and catharsis and inventiveness in literature, and for that I will be forever grateful....more",Notes are private!,0,52,1,"Jun 12, 2020","Jun 12, 2020","Jun 12, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50202953-piranesi

Kiley Reid's Such a Fun Age surprised me in the best way possible: it started off as an easy read, something I coStarting off 2020 with a great read! Kiley Reid's Such a Fun Age surprised me in the best way possible: it started off as an easy read, something I could flip through casually as Reid described the lives and worlds of Alix Chamberlin and Emira Tucker. About 1/3 of the way in, Reid's observant, conversational prose gave way for some incisive and darkly funny and poignant social commentary. Race, class, privilege, female relationships, who and what we love, how we choose to identify, build our narratives and those of others, how people navigate transactional relations that involve the most intimate parts of one's life... nothing is off limits for Reid and she deftly moves from each topic. But Reid's commentary never overtakes the narrative: I found myself caring more for Emira's and Alix's progressions, missteps, mistakes, and confrontations. I won't spoil things for future readers, but one highlight is how Reid builds genuine tension throughout the novel alongside her witty social commentary, highlighted best perhaps in the Thanksgiving dinner scene. I laughed out loud and cringed when Emira first entered the house and Alix's female friends swarmed her asking about if she was watching black-ish, and Alix's friend Tamra lightly upbraiding and acting as mentor by replying ""Oh Emira, you have to see it. It's a very important show."" The character of Tamra is an interesting prism by which Alix and Emira's different views and experiences are illuminated: Alix sees Tamra's presence at Thanksgiving as important, a chance to prove to Emira Alix's bonafides as a progressive, open-minded cool person, whereas Emira feels intense discomfort as Tamra questions her hair, her life choices, her cultural tastes: ""She'd been to several events where another black party guest was foisted on her by a well-meaning but ignorant host, but Tamra appeared to be conducting this interaction on her own."" There's also some clever observation of parenting styles at play - ""A few bites into a strawberry rhubarb pie, Prudence began to have a breakdown about needing more whipped cream (this marked the third time, in Emira's opinion, that Prudence had reached number three).""- and all of this is occurring in the same scene in which Reid is building to the book's first mini climax, and will change the trajectory of Alix and Emira's lives after. It's really impressive stuff, made all the more so by how much fun it is to read.There's so much to like about this book, and I will say especially for female readers of color, there's even more to tease out and nod at and discuss with others. Reid doesn't draw hard conclusions about Kelley's potential fetishization of black women or how far from the tree Alix really did fall in how she created and imagined relationships with Emira and Claudette and these topics are rich for debate, but so is Emira's attempt to figure things out in terms of what she wants out of life for herself, not what her family or Alix or Kelley or Tamra believe she could or should do. There were things that resonated so strongly as a biracial female reader, and yet I never felt like Reid was inviting condemnation or judgment of Alix or Kelley and white characters: she let the narrative unfold and provided depth and revelations that brought context to their actions, and in the end I was pleasantly surprised by how much this book made me think, pause, reflect, consider all of the actors involved in the story.Overall, this is a disarming read, easy to finish and casually written yet sneakily strong and well-observed book. 3.5 stars, rounded up to 4 stars.

Like a stone dropped inThe conceit is fabulous: in 1969, the four Gold siblings visit a fortune teller who bestows upon them the date of their death. Like a stone dropped in a pond, the repercussions reverberate through time and we follow Varya, Daniel, Klara, and Simon across their individual life spans, their choices and actions made in spite of and in defiance of this ""foreknowledge"". Chloe Benjamin's debut novel The Immortalists juggles many questions - do we create our fates or are we slaves to them, how should and how do we live our lives when faced with certain death, what wonder or magic exists for us when we continually learn and know things that take the mystery away - but at the core are these four siblings, and how they reckon with each other and themselves. This is novel of substance, darkness, a family saga, filled with ideas but nothing explored too heavily as to detract from the narrative. Most adults claim not to believe in magic, but Klara knows better. Why else would anyone play at permanence - fall in love, have children, buy a house - in the face of all evidence there's no such thing? The trick is not to convert them. The trick is to get them to admit it.""When Klara peels a dollar from inside someone's ear or turns a ball into a lemon, she hopes not to deceive but to impart a different kind of knowledge, an expanded sense of possibility. The point is not to negate reality but to peel back its scrim, revealing reality's peculiarities and contradictions. The very best magic tricks, the kind Klara wants to perform, do not subtract from reality. They add.Benjamin has a quiet type of prose that sneakily pulls you in, a light touch that somehow fully renders portraits and moments and characters, and the first half of the novel in which the Gold family history and Klara and Simon take center stage is excellent: well-paced, well-plotted, and beautifully told. The complex mix of human frailty and power was fully on display in Simon's portion, and the push to live fully, for and as oneself comes into focus. Klara, the most enigmatic of the siblings, has a unique perspective and position as the titular Immortalist, an amateur magician whose true powers lie in her adept reading of the hearts and minds of others. Simon and Klara are the closest siblings, and their intertwined lives and acceptance of their fates made them extremely compelling to follow. She had lost parts of herself as she lost her siblings. It was like watching the power incrementally turning off throughout a neighborhood: certain parts of her went dark, then others. Certain modes of bravery- emotional bravery- and desire. The cost of loneliness is high, she knows, but the cost of loss is higher.The latter half of the book was somewhat less enjoyable, and the intimacy of the earlier storytelling of Klara and Simon was replaced by distance from Daniel and Varya. I believe this distance is intentional and makes thematic sense: if Simon and Klara are the two siblings who confront their mortal foreknowledge head on (perhaps to their detriment, we're left to wonder), Daniel and Varya choose to fight against it, disbelieve, try to ignore the fortune teller's pronouncement, though it insidiously inhabits their life choices and decisions as well. The major flaw for me was feeling disconnected from this portion of the narrative. Even as I can recognize that was likely Benjamin's idea to have the reader in a similar position as the two remaining Gold siblings, somewhat detached and adrift as the fortunes take hold, I did suffer from less interest, enjoyment, and emotional involvement from the reading experience. And yet, Daniel and Varya's bits have great moments, and the conclusion definitely brought the siblings back together, and some of the ideas and issues Benjamin explores are brought full circle. She knew that stories did have the power to change things: the past and future, even the present. She had been an agnostic since graduate school, but if there was one tenant of Judaism with which she agreed, it was this: the power of words. They weaseled under door cracks and through keyholes. They hooked into individuals and wormed through generations.  Ultimately, this book hooked me and wormed into my heart and mind. I'd give this 3.5 stars rounded up to 4 stars. Chloe Benjamin's debut isn't a perfect novel, but she's a captivating storyteller with a brilliant concept, executed well overall. I really liked The Immortalists and will be even more excited to see what Benjamin writes next. Recommended for literary fiction lovers who don't mind a bit of unevenness, love a fresh voice, and appreciate a good story above all.-received an ARC, thanks to G.P.

The Girl in the Tower is a worthy sequel to Arden's spellbinding debut and Vasya, Morozko and the wonders of Arden's world are all here and full imagined, but the stakes are raised, the pace quickened, the political machinations deeper and the overall mood darker and more ominous. It couldn't be anything other than a 5 star read for me: I love Arden's worldbuilding (fantastical and historical) and was even more invested in the characters and their fates than in the first novel, even if this book is less enchanting and more adventurous and suspenseful than its predecessor. It kept me on the edge of my seat (I was desperately flipping the pages in the latter half, really feeling the tension, and read the final chapters curled in a protective ball) and left me awe of what Arden has created.Everything I loved about The Bear in the Nightingale, Arden truly takes to new heights in The Girl in the Tower: Vasya's bravery and refusal to be subject to the constraints of womanhood for her time, the battle for belief between Russian folkloric tradition and the increasing power of Christianity (and the varying ways men and gods wield their power for good and evil), the framing device of the early folk tale and how it comes to inform the events that unfold. But Arden does not rest on our laurels, and the sequel gives us new perspectives and deeper understanding of Vasya's world. The historical fiction side of the first book is greatly expanded here, with ample time spent with Sasha, who piqued my interest in his small appearances in The Bear and the Nightingale, Olga and her family, and a fully introduced Dmitry, Prince of Moscow (a real figure venerated as a saint in the Russian Orthodox Church). The conflict with the Khan and threat of Tatars is more developed, and the closeted life of Moscow's princesses in the terem is better explored. Arden's true skill lies in her ability to weave these parts with the fantastical elements to achieve her unique narrative thrust. And if you loved the first book's fantasy, never fear. Ghosts, enchanted horse racing, disappearing and silent bandits, and sorcerers all appear along with some more familiar spirits. The relationship between Vasya and Morozko becomes more complicated, more intimate, and more equal throughout The Girl in the Tower, befitting Vasya's continued growth into a young woman and Morozko's continued predicament of loss of belief plus a new struggle in a threat to his eternity, and their interactions continue to shine, albeit with a more dangerous veneer.Vasilia's arc is powerful: the wild girl of The Bear and the Nightingale is still there, but in The Girl in the Tower she is faced with new temptations and challenges, and is often confused about what she wants and acts immaturely and rashly, sometimes with dire consequences. With a true taste of freedom under guise as the boy Vasilii the Brave, her existential conundrum about how to live her life are more heightened and the threat of being closeted in a convent or in the terem as a married woman is more real than ever. Her decisions and actions put herself, Olga, Sasha and many others into jeopardy, but Vasya wouldn't be our heroine if she didn't have a strong sense of self, a brave, sacrificing spirit, and a quick mind. In the sequel, Vasya truly begins to grow up, and her errors and imperfections fuel the plot's trials and tribulations that make for character building for her, exciting and nail-biting reading for us.Overall, Arden is able to take a beautifully told, enchanting story of The Bear and the Nightingale, and present a worthy successor in The Girl in the Tower, one that lives up to the excellence of its predecessor but establishing its own darker, more dangerous tone, rapidly expanding the historical and fantastical worldbuilding while ratcheting up the tension and adventure. If you loved the first one like I did, at the least you will be satisfied, but I hope this kindles greater love in your heart for this world and these characters as it did for me. A standout sequel that leaves me (and I predict many other readers) craving more.

Finn's credit, his protagonist Dr. Anna Fox is a huge classic film enthusiast, which allows the author to nod to the novel's influences while adding to the mood. The meta spin to utilize these influences in the novel's construction and in the plot and personality elements works quite well, and in my opinion epitomizes Finn's overall execution of a smart, noir thriller, not perfect but easily, enjoyably and inescapably read in a single sitting. I began it casually on the commute home, but found myself pulled into Finn's web, and stayed up into the wee hours of the night to finish. While I had some qualms with the book, mostly the slightly strange pacing, my initial, tired reaction to Anna's drinking and drug problems (until Finn revealed their source), and a somewhat lackluster conclusion relative to all that had been built up (though I'm the exception in finding the ending only passable, most other readers seemed to be gobsmacked by it), my overall experience was strong. The Woman in the Window is able to both rise above the average psychological thriller produced in the wake of the successful ""Girl"" books and be more than a mashup of great classic movie moments, Finn achieves this with a genuinely tense, noir atmosphere created from the claustrophobia of a (mostly) single location setting, and array of red herrings and plausible sources of harm and malice, a female protagonist the reader doesn't actively root against and can indeed sympathize with as one learns more about her, and most importantly, a true, tightly wound puzzle of the forward plot (did Dr. Anna Fox really witness a crime in a neighboring family's home, and whodunit) and the backstory that fills in the gaps of what we believe we know about Anna (her agoraphobia, her drunkenness, her estranged relationship with her husband and young daughter). Finn pushes his protagonist over the thin lines between what's real versus imagined, what's paranoia and what's danger, making the reader all the more eager to better understand Anna and solve the question of her past to interpret her present situation. I'd give this 4 stars: I really liked it, read it quickly and eagerly, and my issues with the novel did not outweigh my enjoyment and appreciation. I've had a good streak with thrillers this year, and can definitely see The Woman in the Window being widely read once released. And I could see myself reading it again come winter, with a large glass of red wine in honor of Anna, followed by a Hitchcock or Hitchcockian film. Recommended for fans of recent psychological thrillers who don't mind a touch (or whole helping) of classic noir.-received ARC on edelweiss, thanks to William Morrow...more",Notes are private!,0,46,1,"Jul 27, 2017","Jul 28, 2017","May 18, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34848682-the-woman-in-the-window

A. RIDE.  While the blurb comps The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (definitely shares some DNA) and Gone Girl (not so much in my opinion), City of WHAT. A. RIDE.  While the blurb comps The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (definitely shares some DNA) and Gone Girl (not so much in my opinion), City of Saints and Thieves is such a special, inventive, fresh read that is pure adrenaline in terms of its plot but also gives you ancillary characters to really invest in, a whodunit that becomes more complex as the evidence builds and adds twists, a glittering yet gritty world of Sendai City where anything feels possible and an array of hustlers, thieves, mercenaries, journalists, and wayward children eke out a lives and collide, and probably one of my favorite heroines in recent memory: Christina Masika aka Tina and Tiny Girl. Tina is a flawed sixteen year-old, fiercely protective of family and friends, a skilled thief working for a larger plot of vengeance for her murdered mother, but when she has to confront the recent past and things may not be as clear cut as she thought, Tina's willing to go to any lengths and willing to rethink her core beliefs to seek the truth about her mother and her family's past in the Congo. She's a fighter through and through, and though she has real fears and demons haunting her from danergous times as a refugee from the Congo, Tina forces herself to face them and truths. She's not invincible, and can be a bit slow on the emotional uptake, but her edges are not overdone and her heart and smarts and courage are so winning. In some ways it shouldn't be remarkable that our heroine of a commercially oriented thriller is African in 21st literature, and indeed it's not the most notable thing about Christina, but the setting of a coastal African city and the horrors of commercial exploitation of resources and its role in civil war and the murder and rape of African civilians (especially women) is brought to light by Anderson here, and the information is presented seamlessly in terms of an action packed plot and good characterization. But there is something inspiring in Anderson's choice to lay the mantle of heroine on a girl who in movies or another novel would have been relegated to sidekick or the African other as a foil (I mean, look at movies like Blood Diamond as an example here). That this is YA is all the more astonishing for me: it definitely is accessible enough for an older YA audience and absolutely entertains and informs, but I definitely see this as a strong crossover read for adults. And Anderson make her characters seem entirely familiar to us, easily identifying with them, but also allows us to fully inhabit a world completely different from our own (unless you too are a gang affiliated thief in Kenya with a tragic refugee background).The pace is relentless in the best possible way: clues dropped in the text and picked up throughout, new confrontations and developments each chapter, and there's strong narrative tension and believable teenage dialogue even if this could be an African twist to a Jason Bourne plot. I honestly had so much fun reading City of Saints and Thieves, and am so pleased that a book this well-written and this diverse and this thrilling exists for YA and adult readers. Diversity for its own sake usually winds up not working or being poorly executed: these are great characters first and foremost and a compelling action/mystery plot, and the wildly different African background and setting just add to its uniqueness. I highly recommend this for anyone in search of a great new read, a diverse novel... seriously if you're into exotic locale action-political-personal thrillers and can handle a heavy dose of hard reality (i.e. discussion of rape and murder in the context of civil war) this is the book you're looking for. I hope Tiny Girl, Boyboy, Michael, and the Goondas appear in future adventures by Anderson, but until then, this is a great standalone or first entry to a series, and one I'll likely re-read in the future.-received on edelweiss as an ARC thanks to G.P.

MostThe Cutaway is a solid if somewhat uninspired thriller, with less of the psychological slant it claims, more standard ""woman gone missing"" stuff. Most of the characters come off a bit flat and less than fully realized, so it was a bit hard to be drawn into their personal struggles and romantic difficulties. I did like the angle of being inside the newsroom and at the station with our producer protagonist Virginia Knightly, and how and when information and evidence was sourced and confirmed and reported. I was hoping for a bit more of the corrupt and dark underbelly of D.C. that's mentioned in the blurb: it was discussed but not ominous or threatening. And the ending was a bit of a letdown: the climactic moment arrived far earlier in the story than normal, and it made for a lukewarm resolution and tying of loose ends. But it's very readable and occasionally interesting. Nothing I'd re-read or recommend as a great new thriller, but easy and entertaining. And though faint praise is occasionally damning, I'd rate this 2.5 stars and round up to 3.-received an ARC via netgalley in exchange for an honest , thanks to Atria...more",Notes are private!,0,35,1,"Feb 11, 2017","Feb 12, 2017","Feb 11, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30753708-the-cutaway

Reading Roxane Gay's memoir Hunger is at once a difficult, intimate endeavor, butRoxane Gay, thank you.Unflinching honesty, ugly and beautiful truth. Reading Roxane Gay's memoir Hunger is at once a difficult, intimate endeavor, but the sheer power of Gay's blunt, unsparingly honest prose made this a single sitting read for me, gobsmacked by her willingness to reveal the depths of her pain, her rage, her hope, her insecurities, her jealousy, and her hunger for so many things in this world, some attainable and some tantalizingly out of reach due to physical, cultural, societal, or self imposed limitations. This is a memoir of Gay's body, but she does in his memoir what she asks, begs, demands, fears, hungers for: the reader must see her body, indeed through her eyes we for a moment can feel what it is to inhabit her body, but the reader is also confronted with the nuance and complexity and intelligence and whirlwind of thoughts and desires and emotions that Gay is just as much as her body, and that too often has been stripped away from her in terms of how modern American culture views a woman of size. And as specific as it is, this immersal into the mind and heart and body of Gay, there is so much here that resonates and reverberates loudly, into the collective experience, the female experience, the black experience. There is so much at work here: rape, trauma, alienation, sexuality, familial relationships, the myriad sides and natures of America and how its people deny and demean (but also embrace and love). And perhaps I may have more in common with Gay than the average reader or even if I don't, perceive a closer kinship - biracial, 5' 10"", boarding school kid, in my adult years always tending heavier than I'd (and my family) would like me to be and the requisite concern and veneration of thinness=happiness that comes with that. Gay's ability to probe into the parts of herself she keeps hidden or submerged and bring that multitude of passion and feeling to the surface is incredibly moving, and at least for me, I was able to revel in and admire her honesty while also being forced to consider my own (or lack of it), truths about my complicity in terms of being part of a culture that simultaneously erases fat people but also can't help but accost them and reduce them to sheer mass and BMI and numbers on a scale, truths about how I often elevate the needs and desires of others far above those of my own and deny myself the power and importance of my hunger. I'm not a usually a memoir reader, but the ones I love best achieve this fantastic union of individual and universal. On the side of the individual story, there is specificity and intimacy and honesty; on he side of the universal, there is application for a new way of evaluating the world around you, a new way of understanding, a new perspective to consider. Gay's Hunger did all of those things, but for me struck personally, I felt how she felt and also felt my own feelings, I watched her rage and grieve and fear and felt my own rage and grief and fear. And the power of her honesty in writing this book has at least given me some courage or strength to be honest in my  of her work, even if I cannot yet be as honest about myself. I'm just a girl on Goodreads, and I'm nowhere near as willing to be publicly honest as Gay, but in reading Hunger I couldn't help but be bowled over, experiencing her story and her life, watching her contextualize her experience and evaluate where all of us stand in being complicit with the inequities and indignities of the society we're all part of, letting Gay's sharp, blunt truth penetrate parts of myself I don't surface and force or prompt self-examination. I think Hunger will appeal widely, hitting for fans of Gay's previous work and for those memoir type readers who are ok with an uncomfortable, challenging, honest experience getting into the skin and mind and heart of someone else. For me, this will be one of the most powerful and transformative and necessary reads of 2017. 5 stars, given with a lump in the throat and watery eyes and feeling both full and drained after reading and processing and ing.-received an ARC on edelweiss thanks to Harper Collins...more",Notes are private!,0,91,1,"May 05, 2017","May 06, 2017","Feb 06, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/26074156-hunger

Beartown is one of those rare novels that leaves you swollen with feeling and utter satisfaction, and yet entirely sad and almost dBelieve the hype.  Beartown is one of those rare novels that leaves you swollen with feeling and utter satisfaction, and yet entirely sad and almost disappointed that the story had to end, even though you wouldn't have wanted the author to change or add a single thing. For me, that's the highest level of love I can have for a novel, and I was honestly stunned by my level of engagement with and adoration for this book. 5 stars, no halves or equivocation, a completely fulfilling reading experience that I'd recommend to anyone and everyone.Fredrik Backman executes his portrayal of a small, hockey-obsessed, economically challenged town and its inhabitants perfectly: the characters are well-drawn and specific and believable, the details and histories and culture woven into the dialogue and actions throughout. But the beauty of this novel is that Beartown, Sweden is Beartown, Sweden while also being Anytown, Anywhere. It achieves a fantastic combination of the specific and the universal, the small town and the small story and the one hockey team and the one fateful act that are individual and personal. Yet it transcends this to also encompass larger meditations on sport, tribe, the family we choose and family by blood, parent-child relationships, guilt versus innocence and when and why it's important and to whom, suffering, success and failure, fitting in and fitting out, good and evil versus right and wrong, what it means to come of age, what it means to be left behind in a rapidly changing world, what people are and aren't capable of being or becoming. It's a read that is easy and entertaining in terms of its writing style, but also presents common yet challenging ideas, again amazing and confounding me with its effortless simplicity and profundity at the same time, and for that to happen takes tremendous hard work and craft by Backman. I marveled at how skilled Backman (and his translator) were to keep multiple perspectives and characters popping in and out of the narrative, yet I was never confused and always pulled forward into the plot. And the characters are rich and my need to find out what happened to them was real and urgent and necessary. I won't soon forget Maya's inner strength, the tried and tested love between Kira and Peter, Benji's concealed empathy and understanding, the pain and redemption in the fluctuating friendships between Amat and Zacharias and Amat and Bobo, and even the lesser characters that are still so very real and important and meaningful: Benji's sisters, Ramona the bar owner, Bobo's parents, Amat's mother, Kevin's mother, Sune the A-team coach. Backman answers his own question, sometimes the entire community feels like a philosophical experiment: If a town falls in the forest but no one hears it, does it matter? Yes, because all the people in it matter, their faults, flaws, hopes, dreams, actions good and bad, passions, fears, failures. And even though they are such fully realized characters, it's hard not to recognize yourself and larger strands of the human experience in each of them. This was something that once I started, I did not want to put down. Ultimately, I was completely entranced by Beartown, and Backman's novel is an exemplar of how to cover the whole of the human condition in a single story; how to juggle and wrestle with the myriad emotions and motivations of individuals and collectives, big ideas like love and loyalty and small needs and desires like wanting a better job for one's parent who is increasingly in pain working as a cleaner. This read is astonishing, emotional, entertaining, and just rang so true. And despite me never reading or having an interest in A Man Called Ove, I take notice of books my Goodreads friends seem to universally rate 5 stars, and was intrigued enough to try Beartown. Backman's other books didn't seem like they'd be for me, so a small town obsessed with hockey seemed a bit more up my alley than what I perceived to be his canon of old curmudgeons on quests and doing adorably cranky things. But after having read Beartown, I may need to get outside of my box and pick up Ove: I was impressed and delighted by Backman's talent and storytelling, and I am so happy he has a backlist I can discover in the interim between this and his next book.We burn and bleed and cry, fully aware that the worst the sport can give us, in the very best scenario, is incomprehensibly meager and worthless: just a few isolated moments of transcendence. That's all. But what the hell else is life made of?Beartown will give you 336 pages of transcendence. And at the same time show you exactly what people, what towns, what life is made of.

When the novel is good, it is great: witty, funny, charming, hitting character and plot points macro and micro with ease and precision, and always invoking an accurate but also engaging sense of time and place as we watch Ferguson grow up in the 40s, 50s and 60s in New Jersey and New York (depending on the version) and struggle with his identity, the Vietnam War, Antisemitism, the Civil Rights Movement, racism, the Kennedy election and assassination, white flight, and the hope and disillusionment and fracturing of society during the 60s especially. All of Fergusons' family and friends are well drawn, though I most loved his mother Rose Adler (in every version of Ferguson) and his wisecracking, brilliant cousin Noah Marx (in version 4). There was much to admire, and much to love for the majority of the novel. On the other hand, the book threw me for fits with its pacing. It took me a bit to work through the first 100 or so pages of set up, the backdrops of the Ferguson and Adler lineages detailed but not flowing or clicking for me. But then, sunk into little Ferguson's various childhoods, I was off and devouring each saga up through Ferguson's graduation and moving on (in many versions) to college. Then, around page 600, Ferguson 1 gets derailed in a major student protest at Columbia University in the late 1960s, and the momentum I'd had was lost. The book recovered, as we moved on to see what the other versions of Ferguson got into, but that chapter for Ferguson 1 was long, unwieldy, and worse yet uninteresting. And overall, I don't know that I love the writing of Paul Auster. The brilliance can't be denied, but he's also prone to writing extremely long, run-on sentences, that meander and turn to the point that I would occasionally lose the major focus of the thought. It sometimes read like stream of consciousness inserted into these epics of the Fergusons, which (view spoiler)[makes sense considering the predictable yet still satisfying conclusion that the whole novel was a work by Ferguson 4 (hide spoiler)]. I felt that there was definitely some extra, less meaningful content that could have been removed entirely to keep the pacing tighter, and in general appreciate an author who is a bit more choosy with word choice and sentence structure in literary fiction: some of the writing felt unintentional, versus say how I felt about the writing of Michael Chabon's Moonglow or Kate Atkinson's Life After Life, the hybrid of which could be 4 3 2 1.I don't think this is a read for everyone, and indeed while it delighted me and I enjoyed reading it on the whole and was engaged with Auster's talent, it also irritated me, occasionally bored me and really forced me to work to finish major parts. But again, when it is good, it is great, and for that, I'd award it 4 stars....more",Notes are private!,0,87,1,"Feb 04, 2017","Feb 14, 2017","Jan 31, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30244626-4-3-2-1

Put it in Antarctica with scientists (subtract war) and voila, you have South Pole Station.I did not care for Fobbit, but I mildly enjoyed South Pole Station. It is mostly funny, dark but humanely funny. The South Pole takes less precendence than one might expect: it's focused on Cooper Gosling and her connections with her fellow FINGYs (fucking new guys) and the various individuals and tribes working and carving out lives at the bottom of the earth. But it can get somewhat jargon-y in terms being very science heavy in ways that can sometimes disrupt the main narrative, as it moves from a workplace comedy to climate change denial to a political standoff.It's a bit weird for the sake of being weird. I'd recommend this to people who like dark workplace comedies and skewering somewhat strange situations, and will highlight its intelligence and wit and humor. And though I really did not connect with (or care to) the characters or plot or resolution in South Pole Station, the reading passed by quickly and easily enough and I wasn't bored and the writing was good. Note that if you are obsessed with all things Arctic or Antarctic like I am, this really isn't a novel that will add much satisfaction for your obsession.

It's written in short, staccato paragraphs and chapters, told from the perspective of a sort of Sioux chorus, dipping in and out of the specific narrative of Rick Overlooking Horse and You Choose Watson/What Son to weave with the larger past, present, and future of the Lakota people, very much in line with their beliefs about the unbreakable connectivity of family, ancestors, time. And unlike other modern fables and allegories, this one is rooted in real life just as for the Lakota, ""everyone is born knowing this: we cannot be unless we first belong. Soil is flesh in waiting; flesh is soil in waiting."" The characters are specific people we come to know and root for or against or both, but also extend into symbols, one man or woman standing for the history and destiny of an entire community. The choppiness took a bit of getting used to, but overall I was moved and enlightened by this novel. I enjoyed the writing too, which took on a hypnotic quality by the end and utterly absorbed me, and Fuller's novel also inspired to seek out more fiction and nonfiction focusing on the Native American experience. It's a not a perfect read, but I found it powerful and would round down from 4.5 to 4 stars and recommend it with some caveats. It's good and bad, and it says a lot if you, and most of the people you know, are prepared at any moment to leave where you are, with nothing more than what you might be able to carry, and to never look back. It says a lot if loss is something you're born knowing how to do; and something you've honed with years of practice. You can't have dark without light. You can't know wisdom without suffering. You can't insist on a life. A life insists on you. The Lakota know this: Let go of everything that was not meant for you. The Lakota do not believe anything comes from nothing: when time is circular and infinite, all things and outcomes are connected. So too, Fuller's main characters, Rick Overlooking Horse and You Choose Watson/What Son, come into focus through their people's history. The two orphan boys are brought up together in 1950s and 60s America on the reservation (referred to as the Rez throughout). Both are quickly educated in the ways of the world and possible lots in life for a young American Indian boy, but their shared past diverges as You Choose dodges the draft and moves into an itinerant life, drifting from place to place and searching for a place in the world for him, while Rick goes to war in Vietnam, returns and settles in his native land and builds a life and livelihood via traditional ways and practices. The two estranged ""brothers"" cross paths across their histories and the history of the Lakota, through protests and economic hardships, to changing access and cultural mores, and the alienation and rage of You Choose and the acceptance and peace of Rick are placed not quite in opposition to each other, but as poles on a continuum, and all of Fuller's characters slide across this space as circumstance and need require them. But you're never too fully immersed in the specific tale of these brothers and rivals to not also see the larger cultural and political history of the Lakota in broad strokes and intimate details. The belief that we can be done with our past is a myth. The past is nudging at us constantly. Not only our own pasts, of course, but also the pasts of our ancestors. And the pasts of people we've never even heard of, and to whom we are not related to us at all. The energies of their great passions hang in the air forever, and posses a forever half-life, and all of that is awash in the universe. The chapters are on the shorter side, and somewhat choppy. It took me a bit to get into Fuller's rhythm, until I stopped treating it as a straight forward narrative and started looking at it the way you might a collection of tales that are both individual and part of a larger whole. Fuller narrates from a first person omniscient perspective more or less, speaking through the voice of a sort of Oglala Lakota Sioux chorus, and in this way the more general beliefs and historical occurrences and grief and loss and pain can be discussed beyond the simple narrative. And because the voice is threaded throughout, it's able to fairly seamlessly tell one story while simultaneously telling many, to present the particular developments in the life of Rick and You Choose while nodding to the varying currents through time that have blown both men into the positions they are in, from the Battle of the Greasy Grass (aka Custer's Last Stand) to Billy Mills' Olympic triumph. This aids the reader enormously when covering Rick's (and You Choose's) involvement in the Second Siege of Wounded Knee in 1973: able to show our protagonist's specific actions, while also clarifying and illuminating in a general way the driving hunger and loss and force behind the social movements. The writing itself is mostly the best sort of spare prose: simple words connected for maximum insight and spiritual connection, nothing fancy or romantic or flowery, but Fuller excels at laying bare historical facts and revealing the heart of a man or woman. Her Sioux chorus also addresses the reader as ""All My Relations"": we too, from outside looking in on these lives and the Lakota, we are invited to participate, to understand as part of the family and tribe, to meditate on our shared connectivity and humanity. ""They can say what they like about what happened to Indians in my land. They can rewrite history, and erase our stories. But what my mind hasn't been allowed to know, my body has always known,"" Thunder Hawk said. ""I am an undeniable, inconvenient body of knowledge. Read me.""And then Thunder Hawk Brings Plenty stood in silence for fifteen minutes in front of her live audience.Of course, fifteen minutes is not long enough to know the whole undeniable, inconvenient history of the Oglala Lakota Oyate, or even the whole undeniable, inconvenient history of a single Lakota-born woman. But it is long enough for people to begin to know discomfort, and that's a start. One thing that is hard to ignore is the hot question of cultural appropriation. In a time where the diversity of fiction is questioned on a number of levels, not least about who has the right and authority to speak for the minority or disenfranchised voice, Fuller's novel dives headfirst into that public debate. I think many people, including Fuller herself, that a bestselling memoirist who happens to be white is better positioned to sell a novel of the Lakota than a Lakota native is, for a variety of facts and constructs. But if the purpose of fiction is to entertain and to inform, and present us with an opportunity for empathy, Fuller's Quiet Until the Thaw achieves that in spades, a subtle yet powerful reminder of the historical treatment of Native Americans, but invoking such empathy in a people and culture so easily misunderstood and reduced to caricature or stereotype. It's an opening to greater knowledge and understanding, and from Fuller's full and dignified and enthusiastic and unapologetic embrace of her characters' triumphs and hardships and grace and flaws, I assume she too will not simply stop her education having written this novel. I do believe true understanding and progress can only happen with engagement, and one hopes that a variety of voices from across cultures can be part of the conversation. It's a complex issue and it's easy to understand the strong emotions and ideas on all sides of the debate.Not everyone chooses to be liberated by liberating messages. Some people choose to be terrorized by them. And in this, you can only be what you are.Overall, Quiet Until the Thaw is a unique read: quiet and powerful, focused on specific characters but explicitly and intricately tied to the larger Lakota experience and history, achieving almost a voice and tone from a myth and with the coiling of smaller anecdotes into the larger whole it has the feel of a fable, but from the depth of its research and the punch of its truth and history, it is far more important and memorable than other modern novel-fable-myth hybrids. The writing style may not be for everyone, and Fuller as author will provoke at least some interesting thoughts if not some thoughtful to vitriolic discussion as another datapoint in the debate on cultural appropriation and who can and should speak for whom. But ultimately if the subject matter interests you, I would urge you to read this very different novel for yourself, and hopefully use it as a jumping off point to seek more, read more, deepen understanding as I hope to. -received an ARC on edelweiss, thanks to Penguin Random House...more",Notes are private!,0,32,1,"Feb 07, 2017","Feb 08, 2017","Jan 20, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/32571614-quiet-until-the-thaw

It recounts and reflects on the difficult relationship between revolution and democracy; chaos and governance; generational and class friction; change and order. It examines the push to maintain hope and raise a voice and stand up and be counted, versus the insidious infliction of fear and intimidation to silence and oppression for security: tools of regimes of varying political and religious stripes but all are tigers clawing at control and power. I'd give this 4.5 stars, and round up to 5 stars: it's one of the best debut novels I've read in some time.  This is a louder, darker, more brash and more urgent cousin to many of the immigrant stories proliferating at the moment: this is about pressing forward for progress and justice when the political landscape is shifting beneath your feet, how raw anger and energy and emotion are either channeled into change or ruthlessly thwarted and crushed. And it's very specifically Egyptian in character, though the ideas and ideals of revolution or change are very universal and relevant to many current debates and situations across the world today. You need discipline to win a war. You need chaos to win an insurgency. So which are we? I didn’t know you, but I knew we were together in this, that we have stood together, night after night, regime after regime. We stood together, we failed together. We die apart. Hamilton's novel is not simply a recounting of recent history. It's a human story, focused on Mariam and Khalil and their friends at Chaos, surging forward with the power of the street and doing what they can to document, to demand change and justice, but being slowly worn down with each new martyrdom, shooting, rape. Mariam and Khalil's young, impassioned love follows a parallel track, and we watch as the fate of an ancient nation and the fates of our protagonists and their affection and passion are tied and tested. Omar Robert Hamilton shifts perspective predominantly between Mariam and Khalil, though we also move into the eyes and emotions of the parents and loved ones of the murdered and the missing, rounding out the very human elements of a dark, depressing chapter of recent history. The writing is raw and dynamic, vacillating between profound observations and casual dialogue amongst friends to the stream of consciousness one feels in a moment of crisis, punctuated by true headlines from 2011-2013 and various Tweets of facts and rumors and fears of the time. We’ve done it to ourselves. This cycle of horror. Each scene has to be more shocking than the last. Then they care for fifteen minutes until the next horror horrifies them. And how many horrors until people have to just switch off ?” How many waves of outrage must we spark to reignite the revolution? How many last breaths will we auction off to the breathless internet? If a revolution’s fuel is death, then what will be its end? There's a rebuke for the Western audience as well, the one that expresses horror and demands action about and consumes content on a given crisis for a finite period, then moves on to the next catastrophe of Third World brown people, as though we don't have the attention span, the empathetic capacity, the bandwidth to care for more than one sad sob story at a time. Which certainly our news programs and water cooler conversations reflect this, hopping from Egypt to Syria in terms of nations in turmoil, actions of ISIS and Boko Haram displacing those of Al-Qaeda and Joseph Kony, every now and again allowing space for the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and plight of the Sudanese and the Somalians to resurface. I too am guilty: following the events from Mubarak to the military to Morsi, but once Sisi's stranglehold over the nation took place, my attention wandered to other nations with old and new problems. The triumph of it all is the vanquishing of imagination. There can be nothing new. No new music is imaginable, no new genre, no new memories to repackage and sell, no new stories or ideas or possibilities, no new happinesses. There is only nostalgia and kitsch and superheroes and heartbreak and a sealed fate and surrender. There is no reality other than this one and no past that wasn’t marching toward it. They call it progress. It is undeniable, they tell us, it is all-conquering, it is this and it is now. The world is made. Hamilton's writing is confident and unconventional: shifting perspective abruptly and sometimes without much of a page break, jumping forward in time, marking changing circumstances and major moments by text, by Tweet, by headline. And yet somehow all of it works, sometimes discordant notes coming together as a beautiful melody. The description is detailed, but never languid or lush, instead infused with a constant urgency, uncertainty, tension; the overall effect being captivated but taught as a bow string. The dialogue is smart, snappy, yet sounds authentic: how the characters address each other is as important as what they say. Hamilton also employs strategic repetition in his descriptions, for emphasis and subversion of previously laid out ideas, as well as a rhetorical type of device that calls to mind some famous Arabic songs also known for their power of telling and retelling. Hamilton's gift as a writer is to bring this chaotic situation to life, imbue his characters with real emotion and action and indecision and fear, and explain and show the complexity to a less well-initiated audience, while also being able to fully inhabit and speak about and from multiple Egyptian perspectives with authority. And it helps that he simply has talent to spare:Cairo is jazz: all contrapuntal influences jostling for attention, occasionally brilliant solos standing high above the steady rhythm of the street. New York may say that New York is jazz, but the whole history of the world can be seen from here, flows past us here, in the Nile streaming from its genesis north and out into the waters of empires and all the brutalities and beauties they bring, emerging riotous and discordant and defiant into something new and undefinable and uncontrollable. These streets laid out to echo the order and ratio and martial management of the modern city now molded by the tireless rhythms of salesmen and hawkers and car horns and gas peddlers all out in ownership of their city, mixing pasts with their present, birthing a new now of south and north, young and old, country and city all combining and coming out loud and brash and with a beauty incomprehensible. Yes, Cairo is jazz. Not lounge jazz, not the commodified lobby jazz that works to blanch history, but the heat of New Orleans and gristle of Chicago: the jazz that is beauty in the destruction of the past, the jazz of an unknown future, the jazz that promises freedom from the bad old times. Overall, I found this to be a bold, ambitious debut, well-written, enlightening and entertaining and enraging at various times. Omar Robert Hamilton is someone I'll keep an eye on after this auspicious first novel. I highly recommend this for people who like diverse contemporary fiction, and readers who like to follow first time authors and begin tracing possible paths from their early work. On the basis of The City Always Wins, I'm thinking (and hoping) this is the start of a very fruitful career in fiction....more",Notes are private!,0,68,1,"Jan 18, 2017","Jan 26, 2017","Jan 18, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/31450918-the-city-always-wins

To get right to it: after finishing The Goddesses, I had two main reactions:-I wish Huntley had gone full ""Single White Female"" in the end and taken the crazy to 11 rather than a lukewarm embrace in the climax-Why does this book exist, why did I keep reading this, and who would I ever recommend it to?Rarely am I stumped for words when trying to  a book. Yet my reactions while reading Swan Huntley's The Goddesses vacillated between the following: being irritated by and empathetic to Nancy the main character; feeling tense as the deeply obsessive bond between her and Ana forms and waiting for the shoe to drop; disappointment and disgust as certain twists I saw coming miles away so wasn't caught off guard or surprised by anything in the climax while Nancy is more or less oblivious until the last possible moment; not caring at all about a late reveal of a critical moment from Nancy's past in the epilogue. This is a 2 star read for me: I didn't completely dislike it, but it really did not work for me in terms of plot or characterization, and I might have given it a higher rating if the climax had gone as full on absurdly insane as the rest of the book. But ultimately I was left wondering why I had read the whole thing, so I can't even say I was entertained.Huntley is not a bad writer, even if her observational style is not one I typically gravitate towards. The real issue is that the entire conceit is absurd and yet it doesn't go far enough. It's fluffy and dark at the same time; it needed to choose a side and stick to it. Huntley is striking this middle path between a tale of a grifter glomming onto a broken woman and a slow psychological build versus two women becoming dangerously obsessed with each other and leading to horrifying results. But with a foot in each camp it doesn't go far enough either way for me. Ana is crazy, both of the like a fox and batshit variety - we see her instability and dishonesty and dark currents early on - but she's also not quite crazy enough in thinking about her actions at the end. Nancy is a blank slate, homemaker undone by a philandering spouse, insecure and trying to reinvent herself with her family's move to Hawaii. She's mildly dim and though Huntley purports for her and Ana to share similar backgrounds of hardship that had vastly different outcomes, Nancy never once gets an inkling of the wolf in sheep's clothing, in this case yoga pants, that Ana is. And while I could have occasional empathy for Nancy, her negligence of her teenage twins, her lack of a defined personality, and her immediate adoption of Ana to the exclusion of all else made her more irritating and unlikable than empathetic. Unlikable characters can be very compelling reading material and subjects, but this was not the good kind of unlikable where you're desperate to read more about them; rather the kind of unlikable where I questioned why I was continuing to swipe the pages at all. For the depth of Nancy's feeling/obsession for Ana and upending of her life to accommodate and cater to Ana, I was expecting a more emotional reaction from her at the conclusion. And because the climax was a letdown, I was all the more cranky to have continued with a story and characters I wasn't responding to much only to be left empty handed in terms of meeting my expectations.Most of the side characters are unmemorable or very limited. Chuck is the drunk husband who feels bad about cheating on Nancy but also is in a hurry to just put everything back together with a new Hawaiian sheen. I actually liked Chuck and Nancy's twins, who deserved far better from their parents during this Hawaiian period, but liking them just put into greater focus both parent's negligence, and made me freshly irritated with Nancy for thinking it was a remotely good idea to expose her children to Ana. I did like though that Huntley is making a not so subtle point about trying to outrun one's past or pain: Hawaii may be paradise in a sense but there's nothing that will let Nancy, Chuck or Ana truly escape what hurts and haunts them from the mainland. And as much as Ana swings between perpetuating her good and bad karma, she'll always be hung up on her past, her misfortunes, and the unfairness of it all. Huntley's idea rang true, but it wasn't large enough to make up for the larger missteps, unlikeable and boring characters, and lack of real thrill or fire or action right when things were finally in place to capitalize on the tension. I would not recommend The Goddesses overall: even if there were ok elements, I really don't know who they would appeal to and who I would recommend this to. Not all books are for me: this one most asssuredly was not. I hope other readers have a better experience with it!On a final note, if this hadn't been set in Hawaii, I probably would have never picked it up. Hawaii is my favorite place on Earth, the one destination I've visited most often and spent the most time, and so I do like to read fiction (or nonfiction) set in Hawaii. If you're looking for Hawaiian set fiction (and non), here are some other things to look at instead: Moloka'i, This Is Paradise: Stories, Diamond Head, From Here to Eternity, The Three-Year Swim Club: The Untold Story of Maui's Sugar Ditch Kids and Their Quest for Olympic Glory-received an ARC on edelweiss thanks to Doubleday...more",Notes are private!,-1,80,1,"Jan 28, 2017",Feb 2017,"Jan 18, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/32969045-the-goddesses

I used the moment to look back at Barack Obama before he was president, before he was a US Senator and a state senator for Illinois, and discover the making of the man in his memoir Dreams from My Father. Overall, I'd give this 3.5 stars and round up to 4 stars. I very much enjoyed parts of Obama's journey to adulthood, especially his childhood in Hawaii and Indonesia which I found interesting and well-written, and while the later chapters detailing the consuming, difficult work of community organizing in Chicago and then meeting his extended family in Kenya prior to beginning law school also offer great insight, they are a bit less structurally sound, more peppered with rhetoric, less narrative oriented than the previous chapters. But it's a fascinating glimpse at the early life of the 44th president in his own words, and I enjoyed seeing the anecdotal threads that connected to Obama's personality and policies during his presidency. And his meditations on race relations and his own personal struggle with identity were enlightening, and I personally found it intriguing and answered some questions I'd had about Obama's self-categorization as being black, and not biracial.Above all though, you get a firsthand glimpse of the young ""Barry"" Obama becoming Barack, and what it meant to be a biracial and a black man coming of age in the 60s, 70s and early 80s. His writing and he are intelligent and compassionate, but sometimes the writing style can turn a bit self-indulgent or smug, a criticism lobbed during Obama's presidency but much more subdued than in Dreams with My Father, showing the progress and maturity of a man more comfortable in his own intelligence and skin. He writes of his rage and his anger, but also his vulnerability and fear, of and for himself, and of and for the world he inhabits, and sometimes neither party knows quite what to do with each other. I both understood and was puzzled by some of his feelings of loathing and anger towards himself and US society: I too am a biracial American with a black father and a white mother, though female and with two American parents born and raised, and I personally could connect with various aspects of his struggle and the larger struggle of the black community. But I've never had to face a choice or confusion over what race to be or how to identify myself: I was raised to think of myself as both black and white, as biracial. When Obama was first elected and I discovered he identified himself as black, I accepted that as his right, but was mildly disappointed he hadn't seized a moment to show other multiracial children and adults that the world doesn't (or shouldn't) require them to pick a side, so to speak, that we can represent and be part of both/all races equally. But reading his memoir, and seeing just how different it can be to be a biracial child of the 60s to late 70s, versus me, born in the late 80s coming of age in the 90s and 00s, I definitely got a much better, fuller, deeper understanding of how, where and why Obama came to his own self-identification that still allowed for the embrace of his diverse background. I hadn't heard of Obama or Dreams from My Father when it was first published in 1995 (like most Americans, plus I was nine), and while I was well aware of the book in 2004 when it was re-released just after his famous DNC keynote address, I just never ended up reading it. Reading it now, over two decades after it was first published, I've gained a much better appreciation both for Barack Obama, President, but even more so Barack Obama, person, and even if the version we meet in Dreams with My Father is simply a snapshot in time, the major elements of all the best attributes and actions of Obama are visible. And even if I had some occasional issues with the writing, tone, pacing, I overall found this a worthy read, informative and entertaining and thought provoking. It was a privilege to read through Obama's very personal struggles and difficulties and feel his compassion for others, knowing what path that man would take, and it's a fantastic story: from being estranged from the world, he would go on to lead it....more",Notes are private!,0,89,1,"Feb 04, 2017","Feb 08, 2017","Jan 17, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/88061.Dreams_from_My_Father

As a writer,Everything old is new again, or so goes the thought process when there's a retelling or reimagining of or reengaging with a classic text. As a writer, dipping into a well of classic material must be exciting, filled with rich characters and deep moral, human questions that transcend space and time. But as a reader, it can be a bit sticky going to wade into this world of retellings, especially if one is a lover of the source material. You hope they get it right, stick the landing, tell their own tale while reminding how much you loved (or hated, or were challenged by) the old one. And even though I lean on the purist side and tend to wonder afterwards if a retelling was necessary, I seemingly never fail to read these reimaginings in spite of my varied reactions. Fortunately for me, though Colm Toibin may not improve upon the epic language and poetry that covers the fall of the House of Atreus from the likes of Aeschylus, Euripidies, and Sophocles, his House of Names toes the line between retelling the major motivations and machinations that create the vicious cycle of vengeance amidst the Atreides, and bringing some fresh, clean, modern prose and perspective to an ancient tale of family, power, and violence. I would probably give this 3.5 stars, but round up to 4 because I did find it successful overall: I was engaged with Toibin's versions of Clytemnestra especially as well as Electra (Orestes to a lesser extent), and I was looking for my copy of Edith Hamilton's Mythology: Timeless Tales of Gods and Heroes and wondering if I should dust off my high school copies of Agamemnon, The Libation Bearers, and Iphigenia in Aulis.I went out and looked at the sky. And all I had then to help me was the leftover language of prayer. What had once been powerful and added meaning to everything was now desolate, strange, with its own sad, brittle power, with its memory, locked in its rhythms, of a vivid past when our words rose up and found completion. Now our words are trapped in time, they are filled with limits, they are mere distractions; they are as fleeting and monotonous as breath. They keep us alive, and maybe that is something, at least for the moment, for which we should be grateful. There is nothing else.Toibin's Clytemnestra is our main view point for the majority of the book, covering the main action of the Atredies of the Ancient Greek. It's no spoiler - in the blurb and assumed you know going in - that pretty much everyone dies, and most at the hands of or with tacit approval by family. Toibin though gives a well-rounded portrait of Clytemnestra, a woman who murders her husband and his prized princess/slave/concubine out of vengeance for the murder of her daughter, slain to appease gods Clytemnestra no longer truly believes in or believes care for the fates and actions of humankind. Clytemnestra is not necessarily given the same treatment in modern culture that say Medea is as a tragic figure pushed into acts of evil, but Toibin is able to humanize her, and seeing from her perspective how her voice is literally silenced as her daughter is put to death, we gain some empathy and respect as she claws back into strength and power and plots her vengeance, though our sympathy strains as she does more evil to others of Argos, whether in some madness or coldness of heart. Toibin rightly jumps perspectives to Electra or Orestes as we fully wrestle with the complexities of Clytemnestra's character and actions, and the perceived rightness or wrongness of the varying cases of filicide, mariticide, and matricide we encounter. But rather than the interventions of the gods from Aeschylus and company, Toibin emphasizes the human element, the mortal flaws and desires and feelings that push and pull these Atreides into their appointed positions in tragedy history.Among the gods now there is no one who offers me assistance or oversees my actions or knows my mind. There is no one among the gods to whom I appeal. I live alone in the shivering, solitary knowledge that the time of the gods has passed.Our appeal to the gods is the same as the appeal a star makes in the sky above us before it falls, it is a sound we cannot hear, a sound to which, even if we did hear it, we would be fully indifferent.There's a timeliness and an urgency to Toibin's retelling of this classic tragedy, as in the 21st century it's easier than ever to see and confront the unspeakable evils that man inflicts upon one another, between strangers, between family members, between members of tribes similar and dissimilar. It's a dark tale of old and of new, only reaching a sort of detente in the plays of Aeschylus after justice is finally achieved, Orestes is tried, and the cycle of (and importance of) vengeance is broken to give way to the rule of law. Here, things end more ambiguously, just as in the modern era faith in the rule of law and the ideals of blind justice are somewhat compromised, and every now and again evil and horror rear their heads and prompt instinctual reactions to call for an eye for an eye or some older code of retribution, perhaps less ideal but in some ways more satisfying. Toibin's characters receive no real peace for all their machinations and murders: they're an original cautionary tale, and Clytemnestra's silence, Orestes' uncertainty, Electra's increasing marginalization all speak to a mixed outcome when trying to right wrongs along the path of vengeance. And Toibin is not afraid to tangle directly with the Ancient Greek tragedians: he gives Iphigenia her speech seemingly reconciling her to her fate, but subverts the idea that ""better a single man should see the light than ten thousand women"" and her happy submission to benefit Hellas with her instead cursing and fighting to the last to live, and Clytemnestra needing to be physically restrained and removed from getting to her daughter and cursing the men who would lay hands upon her. There is no miraculous rescue of Artemis inserted after the fact; though ghosts and spirits appear in Toibin's Argos, there is little real strength or character after death for any of the Atreides.""We live in a strange time,"" Electra said. ""A time when the gods are fading. Some of us still see them but there are times when we don't. Their power is waning. Soon it will be a different world. It will be ruled by the light of day. Soon it will be a world barely worth inhabiting."" House of Names is not a life affirming read: it's a retold, classic tragedy, still hitting the same beats that echo off the dark places in all of us, perhaps resonating in a new way as part of a 21st century audience. But it worked overall for me, in terms of considering the work on its own merits and contemplating its relevance in the modern era, and inspiring me to revisit the various source materials that still capture so well the beauty in human behavior, though base, frail, morally right or wrong. -received ARC on edelweiss thanks to Scribner and Simon & Schuster ...more",Notes are private!,0,79,1,"Jan 14, 2017","Jan 15, 2017","Jan 14, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30753709-house-of-names

This is certainly a strange read, and it is dense and for my liking could have been more tightly edited and pacing hastened, and I don't think this is a fault of the translation as this level of minute detail and less action seems more likely to have come from the original novel in Japanese. I did find my attention wandering in the early parts as the scene was set, and could have used more thrusts of activity and doing to break from the long paragraphs of explanation and backstory. But I ended up enjoying this far more than I had in the early parts, and once the stage was set I thought Yokoyama built a nice, confusing puzzle that wound up with higher stakes than just political infighting and power plays. There's definitely great insight into Japanese culture, law enforcement culture in Japan, and how people handle people in a general sense to get what they want or need. Although there are few traditional thrills, towards the end I found the layers of politics and personalities to be interesting, and found the resolution, though a bit open ended, satisfying in relation to the characters we've encountered. Overall I'd say I liked this, though I started out a 2 star read, the intriguing parts were stronger than the boring bits, so I ended up a 3 star read. It's a bit trickier to recommend: I don't think readers of typical thrillers or crime fiction or Japanese fiction would necessarily enjoy this, and its bloat, slow pacing, and lack of real action are definitely demerits against it. But I did invest in many of the characters and by the middle was genuinely interested to see how all the disparate threads would pull together, and I couldn't put together the moves and reveals and twists as quickly as Mikami, so Yokoyama certainly had me guessing and in the dark until all was finally revealed. I don't know that I'd readily read another novel by Yokoyama, but my reading experience for this one ended up pleasant.-received ARC on NetGalley thanks to FSG, in exchange for an honest ...more",Notes are private!,0,47,1,"Jan 17, 2017","Jan 20, 2017","Jan 14, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29875918-six-four

I was able to read this as an ARC many months ago, and enjoyed it so much I decided I would re-read when the weather would match the winter of the novel, and I loved it just as much the second go round. Katherine Arden juggles many concepts and critical historical tensions in this novel - Russia folklore and mythology versus Christianity, a woman's place in society, the Russian tribute to the Mongols and forging of an independent nation - but ultimately all are weaved in to the larger story, an enchanting, updated fairy tale of good versus evil with a wild, independent, strong heroine at its center. The Bear and the Nightingale is many things, but that fairy tale is its heart. I don't think it's necessarily a book for everyone: it starts slowly and coalesces and builds to a climax, and think the fantastical elements and fairy tale quality may not work for lovers of more straightforward fiction. But if this sounds like your kind of read, I would implore you to pick it up as soon as possible, and experience its spellbinding qualities firsthand.This is a fleshed out fairy tale both familiar and exotic. the Russian historical setting kept my mental attention and my interest sharp as aspects of rural and urban Russian life and medieval Russian folklore and beliefs were explored. But we also have the familiar archetypes of a fairy tale construct: a king of winter, an evil stepmother, a father whose mind is turned by said stepmother, an old crone protector, a heroine in peril but persevering. But Arden is able to take these stock figures and make them unique and fully real. Vasilisa (also called Vasya), our heroine, is part wood nymph, part free spirit, whose otherworldly gifts are secondary to the fierce independence and joy she possesses: deep love for her family and a drive to protect them, compassion for others (people or animals or spirits), a zest for life and its simple pleasures of nature, and a lack of fear outside of being caged and having her spirit affixed by marriage or forced into a convent. Vasilisa's options are reflective of the limited status of women in medieval Europe generally, but her more modern chafing at these restrictions works in the context of the fantasy elements. Her stepmother Anna Ivanova I truly disliked, and yet also pitied, but her character is critical and Anna too is more than a bland wicked stepmother: her fantastical fears are real, and her actions towards Vasya are out of fear of what Vasilisa is and a will to protect her daughter Irina, as well as the more standard motivations of jealously and envy. Where the two women clash is also a clash of civilizations in a way, with Anna fervently embracing the Church and seeing all other spirits as demons, and Vasilisa representing the old world, or at least one that can synthesize the Church and allow all things to exist and be possible at the same time. Alyosha and Dunya and Konstantin were also well imagined, and even some of the side characters we saw little of - like Sasha, Vasilisa's brother - were intriguing in their small appearances, really made me long for a sequel to find out what happened next.I loved how Arden framed the whole novel as a tale within a tale: the novel opens on a cold night, when Vasilisa's mother Marina asks Dunya (the family nurse and old crone) for a specific tale, the details of the plot both relating to the circumstances Vasilisa finds herself in later on as well as informing on the backstory of Vasilisa's maternal line. It's a nice, meta nod to a larger framework and immediately ties in to Russian folklore and the forward direction for these characters. The writing is great for the book's hybrid nature of fantastical and historical fiction: descriptive without dipping into a well of purple prose, a light enough touch to propel forward but also able to capture the moody air of increasing peril and fear as the plot advances. And the fairy tale, fantastical component is the main action, but there is background developments of the Grand Duchy of Moscow, and the transition of power from Ivan the Fair to Dmitri, who (did in history, will in future books) challenge the status of Rus as a vassal state to the Mongols. This book's merits and charms worked perfectly on me: I was captivated by the foreign, historic setting, enchanted by the aspects of Russian folklore, interested by the clash of civilizations between past and present and paganism and Christianity, and above all firmly interested in the coming of age of Vasilisa, our brave and wild heroine whom I couldn't help loving and wanted to escape the standard conclusions for women of her time. The Bear and the Nightingale is fantastic, full stop: if you are a fairy-tale person who doesn't mind some historical bits, or a historical fiction person who doesn't mind some fantastical elements, I think this would appeal to you. And I hope you too can read it curled up in a chair or a couch with a nice hot drink and be whisked away to the winter forests of Rus to encounter this story and characters....more",Notes are private!,0,113,2,"Aug 07, 2017Jan 09, 2017","Aug 07, 2017Jan 12, 2017","Jan 09, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25489134-the-bear-and-the-nightingale

We're exposed to the Mazals through our narrator, Izidore but more commonly known as Dory, youngest son of this unique tribe, less intelligent and accomplished than his older siblings but also deeply emotional, empathetic, and extremely curious about his world and the larger world around him. Camille Bordas' first novel in English is witty, funny, smart and occasionally sad, and features some truly formidable female characters in Dory's family and his schooldfriend Denise, so this was a welcome surprise of a novel for me, something I went in knowing nothing about and was delighted reading from beginning to end.While the Mazal children (Berenice, Leonard, Aurore, Jeremie, and Simone) for the most part have skipped multiple years of schooling and are singularly dedicated to pursuing their own individual goals in academia and other fields of passion, Dory is trying to navigate being the only normal level child in a family of geniuses, and also become socially adept or at least functional, while somewhat hamstrung by his overly smart and less socially aware or caring siblings. His mother knows Dory is different from her other children, and though she tries to reach all of them and ensure they're well rounded and can function outside of their bubbles, it's a difficult prospect: ""Aren't the best parties supposed to be phony, though?"" Leonard said, to our mother's surprise.""I believe the best parties are the ones where one enjoys oneself,"" my mother responded diplomatically.""Exactly,"" Leonard said. ""By finding a small crowd with which to make fun of the larger crowd.""""Well as long as you find yourself a crowd, I guess. That's all I want for you,"" my mother said.""No need to find a crowd,"" Leonard said. ""Jeremie and Simone will do just fine.""And goodness this book made me laugh! I'm not usually the reader who gravitates towards comic novels, but this one walks the line well and delivered its lines with sharpness and truth. There's not much overarching plot per se, other than a family tragedy occurring for the Mazals that upsets their standard equilibrium as a family, and Dory pushed to grow up and start considering alternate viewpoints of life besides those of his highly intelligent but socially unengaged siblings. And it's in the characters' conversations and interactions with friends and family that author Camille Bordas won my affection. Simone, Dory's closest sibling, is one of Bordas' best characters: very sharp and forceful and intelligent, but also with acknowledged vanity and a frustration with most everyone that doesn't operate on her level, including her siblings but never Dory, her future biographer. And where Dory is the heart of the novel, Simone is the head, breaking things down for a Dory and the reader as circumstances force hard conversations and change the Mazal children's outlook. ""Maybe you should be the dictator,"" she said, like it was the best idea she's had in a while.""I wouldn't know what to do with power,"" I said.""I'd help you! I have a few ideas for a better society.""""I don't doubt it,"" I said, ""but how would you telling me what to do be different than actually being the dictator yourself?""""Dictators have advisors, you know? No one expect you to come up with all the laws.""""What do you think should be my first measure as a dictator?"" I said.""If I were your advisor,"" Simone said, ""I would make commenting on the internet illegal. I don't think people should express themselves as much as they think they should.""""I'll keep that in mind,"" I said.""Obviously, you should leave this exchange out of my biography.""And then, for a combination of truth and humor and a unique perspective, consider Dory asking his mother about love, a fairly normal line of questioning for an adolescent:""It's your memories with the person that become your love for the person, you know? And building memories takes time. A lot of time, actually. I don't think I can do it again. I don't believe I have enough time left to do it again."" It sounded like she might have a rehearsed speech about love as well. ""When people talk about love, Dory, they call it love because it is a festive word, like 'champagne'. You hear the cork pop just saying 'champagne'. But what they're really talking about when they say 'love' is attachment, ties, which are, admittedly, less glamorous words. And when they say you love only once,"" she went on, ""they don't mean it in a cheesy romantic way or anything, you know? It's very practical, in fact: there is no time in life to get to really know and... tie yourself to more than one person.""""That's a lot of pressure,"" I said.""What is?""""That you only have time in life to love one person. What if you set your mind on the wrong one and waste years on her?""""Well, then you're fucked,"" my mother said. And it doesn't just focus on Dory and his family: Bordas casts the net to extend to small French town the Mazals are from but not really of, the very special tribe of outsiders that the rest of the towns inhabitants interact with in ways ranging from stalking (the succession of gentleman callers for Berenice, Aurore, and Simone) to bizarre (Simone's pen friend who becomes Dory's first big crush and sexual awakening). The town also boasts the oldest living woman in France, whose age is used for illustrative and plot purposes, and Dory forms a deeper acquaintance with her as she teaches him German and town rumors surrounding her past are revealed:""I suppose those people you're talking about still haven't registered how old I actually am. I was already old when the Nazis started rising to power. My husband had died. He couldn't have been a Nazi even if he'd wanted to, poor Thomas darling. Not that he would've wanted to be a Nazi, of course, that's just a way of speaking. He was a German deserter from the First World War, that's how old I am. But maybe they don't teach you about the First World War in school anymore.""""They do,"" I said, in a senseless attempt to defend my education, given I knew next to nothing about the First World War. ""The First World War was with the trenches and the Second with the concentration camps.""""How specific,"" Daphne said.This story, roughly encapsulating a coming of age tale and a portrait of a family, is one of the more charming reads I've had in 2017, and yet for all its charm, it's also full of black humor and some dark situations. I'll say one of main reasons I didn't rate this book higher is that for all of Dory's warmth and goodness and empathetic ignorance turning to knowledge, he does pale a bit as a foil to some of the fiery, spirited, fierce women in this story. But overall I really enjoyed reading this, and definitely recommend it for readers who like quirky family tales, some smart writing, and like a good laugh with an occasional French twist. 4 solid stars.-received an ARC on edelweiss, thanks to Tim Duggan Books and Penguin Random House...more",Notes are private!,0,52,1,"Jan 04, 2017","Jan 05, 2017","Jan 04, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/31951323-how-to-behave-in-a-crowd

Sometimes, it withholds.There are many novels I enjoy, love, praise, wax rhapsodically about. But fewer works of fiction do I find to be important, books for our time now, getting into issues and ideas and peoples and places underrepresented or not represented well and bringing enlightenment or at least understanding as well as entertainment. For the second straight time, I found Jesmyn Ward's novel to be incredibly important as well as enjoying Ward's storytelling, character voice, and sharp, heartbreaking writing in Sing, Unburied, Sing. Ward gives us access to an America not often portrayed or portrayed well or comprehensively, and she renders the inhabitants of this place and their stories honestly and without judgment. If you've read Ward's debut Salvage the Bones, you know not to expect a comfortable or easy read: there's violence, brutality, uncomfortable truths and unsettling fictions exposed, but it's emotionally enveloping. Her style is unsettling and thought-provoking but it's wrapped in stark yet sensual, lyrical prose. Despite the darkness of events present and past, love and family, however damaged and bruised and complicated, remains. I liked Salvage the Bones for all of these reasons, and feel as though Sing, Unburied, Sing improves upon Ward's talent and provides us with a timely, important novel that is unflinching and unsentimental and honest while being beautifully rendered and crafted, and for that I gave this book 4.5 stars round up to 5 stars.Through the lens of a family odyssey to Parchman penitentiary to collect the would-be patriarch, Ward captures a community not always well covered and certainly not well understood: poor, rural people on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, and her characters are complete people with their own set of trials and tribulations and dreams and regrets that collide into the wishes and heartbreaks of others, as they all individually and collectively attempt to make it through the grind of daily life. And this struggle for Jojo, his mother Leonie, and the rest of their multi-generational, multi-racial family is set against the place they live, but also against the fabric of the past that informs their present, from the literal ghosts of past crimes and horrors that haunt them to the legacy of Jim Crow and segregation that conspire to lay burdens and keep people in place to the inherited poverty that seems more than inescapable, simply inevitable. Ward does a phenomenal job bringing humanity and nuance to her characters and our perspectives of them, and contrasts the reader's gravitation to the serious diligence of Jojo and his deep love for his solid grandfather Pop and innocent little sister Kayla with the chaotic, complicated character of Leonie, a mother who does not find herself slipping naturally into the role, a drug user and abuser, selfish and sometimes frivolous but also desperately in love with Michael, Jojo and Kayla's father, and motivated and firm in her commitment to him (which is quietly and powerfully reciprocated by him for her) in all things. Leonie's a character that can turn off the reader at first blush, and it's to Ward's credit that we get enough in her head to see how and why she is, and recognize her better qualities and her own conflict within while abhorring many of her actions as a mother. I didn't understand time either, when I was young. How could I know that after I died, Parchman would pull me from the sky? How could I imagine Parchman would pull me to it and refuse to let go? And how could I conceive that Parchman was past, present and future all at once? That the history and sentiment that carved the place out of the wilderness would show me that time is a vast ocean and that everything is happening at once? Ward's ability to juggle perspectives (Leonie, Jojo and the ghost of Richie, a friend of Pop's from Parchman) with complex and intersecting issues of race, incarceration, drug addiction, privilege and poverty, and coalesce the whole tale into a journey there and back again to prison and make it authentic and compelling is frankly astounding. She dips into the well of magical realism with the ghosts and secrets of the heart and the inherited abilities to see what cannot normally be seen or hear what cannot be heard, but it's all rooted, grounded, held fast to the past, to a tradition and history of a people and a region that it adds a somber touch to transcend time but never moves the reader too far beyond the raw, gritty emotions of the narrative. Having just read another novel that does bring us into the vast ocean of time specifically in the Gulf Coast and weaves in the history of incarceration and exploitation and erasure of black bodies (White Tears), Ward's is the subtle, integrated approach, everything coming together in moments small and large, dialogue and inner thoughts, never more than the story she is telling. This may be partly due to Ward's positioning as an ""insider"" versus writing it from an outside perspective: one gets the sense that Ward truly inhabits the lives, bodies, minds, hearts of her characters, that she too can tap into this vast ocean of time and roots and sense of place and interpret and reflect it as she wills, with a strong truth I couldn't help but find authentic and meaningful. And she cannot stop the disappointment and heartbreak and desperation that follows, but to do otherwise would be untrue, inauthentic, not just to her characters but to the nature of life for all who live it, now or ever. And again, it is not uniformly bleak, and seeing the different forms of family and love and strength and commitment expressed is also just as authentic, true, important, and redeeming.Jesmyn Ward won the National Book Award for Salvage the Bones, and for me shows her staying power and growth and maturation with Sing, Unburied, Sing. If you liked her debut novel, this should be a must read for you. If you're new to Jesmyn Ward but enjoy contemporary fiction and are looking for a fresh voice, don't mind dialect here and there, and want to experience something entirely new, read this book. She's a great voice in American fiction, and for me hits the mark powerfully and subtly on matters of race and history while always keeping storytelling and narrative and character at the forefront. Timely yet transcendent, entertaining and emotional and important, Sing, Unburied, Sing will likely rank among my favorite reads of 2017.-received as an ARC on edelweiss, thanks to Scribner and Simon & Schuster. ...more",Notes are private!,0,91,1,Mar 2017,"Mar 04, 2017","Dec 29, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/32920226-sing-unburied-sing

Tracy Chevalier does a fine job turning the classic, passionate tragedy into a character drama in which the children's thoughts and deeds are a reflection of the some of the worst or most insidious ills and nastiness of American society, and though set in the 1970s, I felt a dull ache of discomfort of how relevant the same sentiments and issues and ills are in today's world. I would rate this 3.5 stars overall: it's perhaps a bit short for my liking (especially considering Othello is one of Shakespeare's longer plays), somewhat unbelievable in the rate of escalation of events (arrival and love and betrayal and consequences all in a single school day), the ending which has a dark but unsettled feeling, and it didn't do much to engage with the source material beyond its adaptation to this new narrative, which felt like a bit of a missed opportunity. But I rounded up to 4 stars for the very solid craft and execution, the well-developed versions of Othello, Desdemona, and Iago who quickly captured my interest and aroused my sympathy, and the consistently tense and foreboding atmosphere Chevalier created in the most seemingly unassuming of locations and places.Osei is the titular new boy, a Ghanaian diplomat's son whose arrival on the playground of an all-white school in the Washington D.C. upends the established array of alliances and status, to the delight of Dee, who immediately connects with Osei, and to the displeasure of Ian, who prefers the previous pecking order and wants to destabilize O's fledgling relationship with Dee and social currency. Knowing what's in store in a general sense for Osei/Othello, Dee/Desdemona, and Ian/Iago means we follow Tracy Chevalier's developments through the day with trepidation: these are children, after all, so their confusion and anger and distress and suffering all the more weigh on our conscience, especially driven as they are by parental and social forces imposed on these children.In less than 200 pages, Chevalier gives us a wealth of backstory for Osei, Dee, Ian and Mimi/Emilia. In some ways, I was amazed at how quickly Chevalier could push the story into its downward spiral, and yet these adolescents were not mere stand ins for their Shakespearean counterparts. Osei's double isolation as the only black boy and new boy at school is mirrored in his home life: disconnected from his parents, no longer having a real relationship with his once beloved sister, constant relocation due to his father's many postings, various successful and unsuccessful outings at American schools and dealing with the ignorance and casual and overt racism in the world around him. Osei is an intelligent boy, but one susceptible to the machinations and manipulations of Ian with the growth of his inner rage, fear, loneliness and pain. We may not get quite as much detailed backstory with Dee, but we are given enough to see how different Dee is from her peers, that she is eager to connect with Osei and seeks to understand him and bridge the gap between their differences, a bright, happy, serene girl more worldly and mature than others in her class, whose goodness and boldness Ian exploits to drive Osei's suspicion. Ian is perhaps most like his original source Iago: pure Machiavellian villain, clawing at power, brutal and uncaring of the feelings of others, driven by jealously and coldly delighting in his power to destroy. But he too, arouses pity and sympathy, an adolescent, if only we could reach him, turn him to a better path! And that is the genius of Chevalier's setting and time and characters: New Boy keeps the powerful themes of Shakespeare's work, but ups the ante and the stakes since it's the lives of children now in the balance.Overall, this is a worthy entry to the Hogarth Shakespeare series, and though I did find some flaws with it and did not love it nearly as much as the more muscular and meta Hag-Seed, I would definitely recommend it. That said, I think this one is more for readers of contemporary fiction than Shakespeare fans: there's little allusion or ode to Othello or the Bard here, which means the story and characters stand on their own merits, but is a bit more untethered from its source material.-received an ARC of this on edelweiss, thanks to Hogarth and Penguin Random House...more",Notes are private!,0,78,1,"Feb 15, 2017","Feb 17, 2017","Dec 29, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/31706250-new-boy

The writing itself is quite good in terms of realistic dialogue and description, but I found all of the characters entirely unlikable and hard to empathize with, very few with any positive animating traits, mostly just self-absorbed, narcissistic, occasionally cruel and capricious. Either in addition to or because I didn't respond to the characters, I also didn't respond to the plot well: the stakes seemed very low, there seemed to be little personal growth from any of the characters (despite this being a story entirely focused on people rather than situations), and when more or less the entire main cast is unlikable, it can be hard to invest in an outcome. Because the craft itself was strong, I'd give this 2 stars and say ""it's ok"" overall, but I wouldn't recommend it personally.The central conceit is two twenty-something friends and former lovers, Frances and Bobbi, get pulled into the orbit of photographer Melissa and her actor husband Nick. Then France and Nick become drawn to one another, and begin an affair that leads to uncomfortable situations and confrontations with Bobbi, Melissa, and their friends and family members. It's set in Dublin, Ireland, but the way it's written and the poetry-art-acting cultural trifecta it hits, it may as well be set in California. It didn't feel particularly Irish at all, so I was a bit lost on sense of place and specificity.We see things from Frances' perspective, which might be part of the difficulty with this read for me. Frances is entirely selfish: she begins the book that way, and aside from maybe inches of character growth, she also ends the book that way. We're told how intelligent she is, but she seems to be perpetually blushing, blundering into things, acting cruelly and capriciously when it suits her, and retreating to dark corners to cut herself when she's incapable of expressing her true feelings. It didn't help that Frances is also living off an allowance through her father, not feeling pressed at all to support herself for much of the novel, content to wallow in her feelings for Nick and assert dominance and indifference to him to disguise her growing dependence and obsession with him. (They say it's love, but honestly these characters are all so selfish it's easy to think that they say it's love but it's not.) Nick meanwhile is a somewhat caddish, sad, broken and oppressed man, mildly unhappy with his life but without real power or impetus to change it. Not all characters need to be likable in order to enjoy a novel about them - I can think of plenty of anti-heroes and somewhat nasty characters that are delightful to read - but I struggled greatly trying to empathize with these characters, finding very little compelling about their personalities and their decisions, but also not being poorly behaved enough to be completely disgusted with them. That made it very difficult for me to engage and be entertained or informed while reading. Bobbi is a decent side character and has a greater, more complex personality, while Melissa never comes across as more than a controlling, dominating woman (possibly because we're in Frances' perspective, and Bobbi is her former lover and best friend, while Melissa is her rival for Nick's physical and emotional affection and attention).When the focal point is an illicit, uncertain relationship and the rest centers on other relationships spiraling and changing in reaction, you don't want the writing to put distance between you and the characters. As good as Rooney's craft is, I did feel as though I was peering into their lives and their messy actions but at arms length, and again hard to say if the writing was responsible or my disinterest in the characters. I would want to feel immersed in the action, pulled in and maybe disgusted or titillated or both, but fundamentally unable to look away (very much how I felt reading White Fur). With Conversations with Friends, I was just bored, feeling the distance and not caring that neither myself nor the author was taking pains to close the gap. And the scenes of sex and intimacy did not feel charged or challenged; they seemed pathetic and pitiable, but in the most banal way, so I had little sympathy for Frances or Nick as they embarked on their affair. There's not much more to it: again, it's a novel of relationships, and there aren't huge plot elements or set pieces or massive emotional bombs. It quietly crawls along, never fully climaxes, and resulted in a sort of ambivalent ending that made a lot of sense to me based on the selfishness of these characters. I do believe Sally Rooney has writing talent, and there are some good paragraphs and dialogue in terms of craft. But I could not connect with this book at all, and was too bored by the characters and wearied by the proceedings to hate them. Again, the writing was good enough that I think it warrants two stars, and perhaps other people will find more that speaks to them from this book. But it was absolutely not for me....more",Notes are private!,5,2807,1,"Jan 03, 2017","Jan 03, 2017","Dec 29, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/32766661-conversations-with-friends

Nguyen does an excellent job of varying style, tone, and composition for each story, so each has a unique perspective to offer and never feels redundant to what's come before. The (slight downside) is that it doesn't always feel like a collection birthed as whole, but rather separate parts coming together in one volume. And indeed, in the copyright page, one can see that various versions of these stories appeared in journals and magazines over the course of a few years. Of the 8 stories included, I thought 4 were fabulous, 2 very well done on the whole, and 2 a bit weaker and perhaps a bit out of place in terms of caliber of storytelling and collective relevance. It's that tangible lack of a collective intent or thrust that pegged this read at 4 stars as opposed to 5 at first, and short story collections can be trickier to . But ultimately I really enjoyed the vast majority of Nguyen's The Refugees and admired the prose and was entertained and informed, even if it didn't quite come together cohesively enough for it to be spectacular for me, it was more than solid and it left a lasting impression on me, so I rounded up to 5 stars. And while I did not enjoy Nguyen's The Sympathizer on my first attempt reading it, my response to his writing here makes me want to give that Pulitzer Prize winner another shot.Standout stories: ""Black Eyed Woman"", ""The War Years"", ""I'd Love You to Want Me"", ""Fatherland""-received an ARC via netgalley in exchange for an honest , thanks to Grove Atlantic...more",Notes are private!,0,77,1,"Jan 26, 2017","Jan 27, 2017","Dec 22, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30358505-the-refugees

Well written, this is easy to get sucked into, something to finish as quickly as possible to learn how Hattie ended up murdered in a barn, a young life of promise snuffed out. That might have been my only issue with the book: Hattie is by far the most compelling character, and either her myriad of faces and personas mask some loneliness and insecurity of a smart, driven girl in a too small town, or she's a manipulative, Machiavellian teenager who schemes with every part of her brain and body to break free from monotony and the boredom of her life. So when we are taken from her perspective, I felt immersed in lesser beings, even if they added to the present case building and past lead up to Hattie's murder. But Hattie is absolutely the star of the show here. I'd probably be at a 3.5 star rating, but round up to 4 stars for quality writing, an ending and answer I really didn't see coming, as well as an unlikeable but indomitable main character. Definitely recommended for fans of psychological thrillers: this one rises a cut above the standard and is well deserving of mass interest and praise....more",Notes are private!,0,30,1,"Jan 11, 2017","Jan 14, 2017","Dec 20, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29276588-everything-you-want-me-to-be

It's a not a thriller, despite the use of ""girl"" in the title, but I enjoyed it the more for not requiring any of the elements of a traditional or psychological thriller. The writing is quiet but powerfully observed, forming a character and community portrait with the murder mystery element a hook to draw in your attention. I'd give this 3.5 stars, and round up to 4 stars for overall execution. The three focal points of the novel are Cameron Whitley (the boy, Lucinda’s stalker more or less, who is complicated and a bit odd in terms of how he perceives things and expresses himself), Jade Dixon-Burns (a few years older than Lucinda, outcast and different to Lucinda's easy beauty and popularity, and erstwhile rival for the affection and attention of a high school boy), and Russ Fletcher (the police officer whose former partner was Cameron's father, harboring his own secrets and guilt as the investigation proceeds into Lucinda's death). Kukafka switches perspective throughout (third person for Cameron and Russ, first person for Jade) and while this can be difficult, she really pulls it off seamlessly. Cameron is sweet, simple, heartfelt and innocent, but also a bit odd which can veer into creepy, his tendency to be ""Tangled"" and his shifting, untrustworthy memories early on lead us to suspect he knows or did more than he believes or knows consciously, especially as it’s emphasized his long gone father did something criminal and brutal. Cameron’s explicit watching of Lucinda mirrors how the other inhabitants of the town watch each other, into and involved in each other’s lives. Jade is sharp, sarcastic, standoffish, but also creative and more than a bit brave. She’s the perspective that gives us the most on Lucinda’s past before her murder, and also what it means to be a teen girl in suburbia, desperate to break out. She tries to reclaim her life by turning it into scripts, dialogue to achieve either a narrative outcome or emotional thrust she’s looking for in her own life, with no friends anymore, a younger sister she dislikes yet protects, and an abusive, unfeeling mother. Jade was probably my favorite of the perspectives because I truly did feel immersed in her thoughts. Russ is the least important to the suburban mystery and town building, yet he is a compelling character on his own, dissatisfied with the state of his life and in denial about deeply hidden parts of himself, and his connection to Cameron and Cameron’s absent father (his former partner on the police force) are compelling and mysterious at first, and ultimately poignant as we better understand the nature of their relationship.It’s not just the solving of Lucinda’s murder, it is how a small town reels, grieves, casts blame. And of course how life goes on for the living, as bad or as good or as messed up as whatever came before her death. And it can be unsettling for the reader at times, as I certainly could recognize elements of my own past ideas or behavior or judgments in regards to a moment of collective consciousness. Overall I was surprised about how much I liked this read. Kukafka does provide the whodunit answer for the murder mystery framing the tale and wraps the story nicely, but the book (and my emotional involvement) was transcendent of the thriller trappings to be a very solid, well written, character driven novel. I would definitely recommend this....more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,"Dec 18, 2016","Dec 18, 2016","Dec 18, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/32920254-girl-in-snow

I Ragdoll is a compulsively readable crime thriller: fast paced, fresh, well-plotted, with strong characterization and a darkly absorbing atmosphere. I tend to not be a lover of thrillers, whether crime or psychological, so I was surprised how much I enjoyed this read. And unlike other thrillers, Daniel Cole truly kept me guessing as to who was orchestrating the grisly events and more importantly, why. I won't delve deeply into the plot, as this is one best read and experienced with little outside information going in. But all of the characters are great, with some familiar cop beats but also all more than your standard stereotypes even while some inhabit and exhibit them. The writing is snappy, there's plenty of humor (both light and dark), and the stakes feel high for all but the crimes are also increasingly personal and intimate. I was caught off guard by the ending, in the best possible way, and would be excited to see more novels dealing with some of these characters in the future.

That's my overall feeling having finished The Gentleman's Guide to Vice and Virtue, a grounded yet fantastical swashbuckler of a novel. (4.5 stars for me, rounded up to 5). Whip smart, hilariously funny, and with winning and fully imagined main characters, it's a mashup of a a classic adventure story (complete with pirates and highwaymen and sinking crumbling islands and a mysterious scientific advancement that involves a race against time and a dastardly villain); a romance as our protagonist and first person perspective Henry ""Monty"" Montague wrestles with his own (endearing but worst) rakish impulses and tries to get a handle on his passionate and dedicated love for his best friend, Percy, a coming of age tale as Monty, Percy, and Monty's sister Felicity are all exploring it what it means to be adults and relationships to their families and if an independent life can exist for them; and a Grand Tour tale gone awry, based in reality but slightly twisted trapping of 18th century life. Juggling these concepts is no mean feat, but Mackenzi Lee pulls it off and then some. The writing is fast paced, pushing and propelling the reader forward, enjoying the adventurous highs and emotional lows of the action and characterization. And the characters themselves - especially Monty, Percy, and Felicity - are so completely charming (and complete characters) that you can't help but fall in love with the lot of them, root for them, and have your heart shrink and swell with their defeats and poor decisions and epiphanies and triumphs.I won't get into plot spoilers or quote anything (might revise with quotes once it pubs), but will talk about the characters more because honestly half the fun for me was being completely caught off guard by Monty's voice and observations and I'd hope I could preserve that feeling of surprise and delight for future readers. (I downloaded this not knowing anything about it really, just being caught by the cover and reading on a whim). Monty is endlessly endearing, with the appearance of a devil may care rogue who relies on charm and looks to skate by, but has a depth of feeling and emotion and pain and fear he's covering up, and it's hard not to fall completely in love with him as a character as he tries to rectify his typically good, well-meaning intentions with bouts of bad behavior and poor choices, that often put the people he loves into dangerous situations. It's Monty who transfixes us first, but Percy and Felicity are of equal importance and are embraced as easily: Percy for his quiet way but loving devotion, more aware and accepting of who Monty is before Monty can comprehend himself, and his own dignity and strength in the face of fear and an uncertain life ahead of him; Felicity for her boldness and fierce intelligence and refusal to be constrained and tied to a limited life for an 18th century woman of the landed aristocracy.The Gentleman's Guide to Vice and Virtue is also unique in that it features characters and plots that do work in a historical context but ask and answer provocative questions that are still very timely and topical today about race, gender, sex, disability. And for all its sadness and real world darkness, there is so much uplifting about this read, as what come to be our beloved main characters struggle and fight to achieve a place in this world that is meaningful for them, and come to terms with themselves and their own feelings, needs, and ambitions in a world that in many ways tries at best to limit them, at worst to stamp them out entirely. Some elements of 18th century life are not entirely historically accurate (as Lee herself alludes to in her author's note), but as this is not straight up historical fiction and is just based in that world, anachronisms don't feel egregious or as important as the larger ideas Lee draws about how queer and disabled and chronically ill and minority and female people were and are treated, but in her characters' dialogue, actions, and ideas, we see them fully engage with themselves, each other, and their world, complete people well-represented and ultimately empowered. This is one of the more diverse main and supporting casts with complex ideas and truly human treatment I've encountered in awhile, and because Lee has breathed life into Monty and Percy and Felicity so fully, it comes off effortlessly, and in many ways I was so wrapped up in the characters and the plot to pay attention to Lee's craft, a mark of a great read for sure. I don't tend to read tons of YA (and this one definitely straddles the line between YA and adult fiction in a lot of ways, and I would see it skewing older in YA for sure), but between this and Caraval I've had two really great reads in the genre, both very different in category. Both titles make me want to continue to expand my reading in YA, now that I've seen some of the best authors with the most inventive, creative ideas on offer. And Mackenzi Lee, and The Gentleman's Guide to Vice and Virtue, definitely are leading the charge in terms of fresh, fun concept meets fully imagined and compelling characters meets well executed writing and craft of a story. Gosh this was good! I'd recommend this rowdily to all and sundry, but especially for YA or historical fantasy type readers who are looking for something brand new and bold to devour. And I really hope we see more of Monty, Percy, and Felicity in a sequel, but if not, it'll be one of my favorite YA stand alone reads. UPDATE: I still love this book, may re-read it once it publishes at the end of the month, and as I originally wrote that I'd love more adventures of Felicity, Monty and Percy, I'm so excited to hear that a sequel has been sold! I will be very pleased to eventually get my hands on A Lady’s Guide to Petticoats and Piracy. -received an ARC via edelweiss, thanks to Katherine Tegen Books and HarperCollins....more",Notes are private!,0,57,1,"Dec 21, 2016","Dec 27, 2016","Dec 09, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29283884-the-gentleman-s-guide-to-vice-and-virtue

I started this on the train home today on a whim, and the magnetic pull of Caraval could not be denied. I was expecting light, enjoyable YA, so I was caught off guard in the best way possible by the depth of the world building, the believable and slow progressing love story, the devotion of Scarlett and the faith and ingenuity of Tella (the two sisters at the center of the novel), the endless action and thrills and building stakes, and overall the exhilarating, magical spell the book had on me. This book was un-put-downable to the highest power. I don't read YA frequently, and even though it's definitely aimed at a younger reader than me, I could get lost in its charm and freshness, be in awe of the zany but dark world of Caraval, and get swept up in the nonstop twists and thrills and reversals that are embedded in the plot and can be entirely unpredictable just when you think you've got things figured out. It's not a perfect read, and can be patchy in parts, but overall I was carried away by the storytelling. I was looking for this level of head over heels enchantment in a world when I read The Night Circus long ago, or even Heartless more recently (both 3 star reads for me), but neither had the punch, the color, the emotion that Caraval does. If you're trying to come up with a comp I might actually say that the best mashup might be to think of the framing set of The Night Circus in that an elaborate performance where regular people mix with players that cover darker and more dangerous machinations and motivations, mixed with the dark, fantastical whimsy, beautiful and colorful world building, strong character progression and heart of Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away. The writing is very strong overall: the descriptions are lush without falling into purple prose traps, and Garber does a phenomenal job of revealing the world of Caraval slowly and seductively, giving us pauses and beats to emit awe or fear as the moment requires. It'll sound hokey, but the storytelling and style is as magical as the world we're in, and indeed if Garber's writing weren't quite so good the whole execution wouldn't be as believable or fantastical as we need it to be to buy in. Scarlett as the protagonist is likable at the beginning, and very easy to root for as she risks everything to save her sister, makes mistakes, falls in love, is deceived, and ultimately learns to move forward, face her fears, embrace an unknown future and be empowered. While we don't get quite as much insight into Tella, since as the blurb will tell you Tella is the person/thing to be saved by Scarlett, her bond with her sister is very, very well done: just when you think perhaps things are one-sided in terms of sisterly devotion, Garber surprises you and shows just how worthy each girl is of the other's love and loyalty. And Julian, the love interest, is at first glance the rogue with the heart of gold, but is so multifaceted and presents so many different emotions and aspects, the reader and Scarlett are both charmed and yet wary of this man. I know that YA can often have trouble with instalove, but while Scarlett and Julian are somewhat attracted to each other near the outset, the developing and complicated emotions between them really develop slowly and seem fairly naturally unfolding under the circumstances of the plot. Not everything is perfect in terms of characterization - the Bad Dad seems a little too over the top and a bit of a trope for example - but the main characters are strong focal points and the side characters (Aoki, the Count, Legend, Jo, Dante) add some great diversity of characterization to the mix.I'd avoid saying more about the plot, other than the game and performance that is Caraval is (of course) more than meets the eye, and the plot really moves forward with varying twists and surprises and doesn't get bogged down in the description or characterization to do it. If a recurring theme in Caraval is that though it may be a game, one can lose their hold on reality while operating in a world so fantastic but also unreal in a manner of speaking, we the reader are just as swept up as Scarlett, and we too have difficulty discerning between what parts are performance and what parts are real, and when things are both or masquerading as one but being the other. Garber keeps us guessing as much as her protagonist, which really propelled me along quickly. I'll wait eagerly for the next in the series, but on a first read basis I could see myself bringing this into company with Sabriel, The Golden Compass, The Amulet of Samarkand, other first YA books that launched me into series that I can read again and again. Stephanie Garber has written a fantastic first novel to a series set in a fully imagined and fascinating world, one we are immersed in but also feel as though we've only just scratched the surface of. I enjoyed this immensely and she left me wanting more, a winning combination. 4.5 stars rounded to 4, an absolute pleasure to read this....more",Notes are private!,0,48,1,"Dec 15, 2016","Dec 15, 2016","Dec 08, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/27883214-caraval

Portrayed by contemporary and modern writOf the six wives of Henry VIII, Catherine Howard is usually the least enviable and least admired of the lot. Portrayed by contemporary and modern writers as a vixen, temptress, whore, idiot, pawn, simpleton, innocent and thought of as empty-headed, frivolous, lewd, lascivious, faithless, deceptive, ignorant, only in Gareth Russell's extremely engaging and readable biography do we finally achieve a comprehensive picture of the elusive fifth consort of Henry. Throughout Russell weighs various theories about her (from her actual year of birth, to whether or not she and Culpeper consummated their relationship), then uses multiple pieces of historical evidence to show the weaknesses of each and advances what he considers the most likely theory from the available evidence. But there's no agenda here: Russell neither seeks to restore Catherine's good name at the expense of the various men who abused and exploited her, nor does he slander hers and dismiss her on account of her actions at Lambeth and later at court. Instead Russell truly seeks to consider Catherine objectively and carefully and come to understand her, and that he does so means we do so as well, and all the better than I was consistently entertained and informed throughout.Russell is able to situate Catherine's circumstances and character against the larger backdrop of daily life and expectations for the aristocrats and courtiers of Tudor England, and brings forth a fully imagined world with its rules and laws, writ and unspoken and revised, made by God, man, and sometimes both, and how and why Catherine's eventual downfall could only come to pass from a particular set of political and social circumstances of Henry VIII's court. And as good as his early chapters are, tracing Catherine's early childhood and coming of age and early predilections for lightly bending or bucking the established codes of conduct, his reconstruction of the whirlwind of activity and investigation is absolutely fantastic. While Catherine shared the fate of her cousin, Anne Boleyn, and the downfalls of both queens cost men their lives, Russell shows just how diligently and thoroughly and carefully the king's counsellors proceeded with the inquest into Catherine's relations with Dereham, and later with Culpeper, in stark contrast to the Boleyn proceedings in which by some contemporary and most modern sources show just how politically engineered Anne's downfall was. And even then, without a retroactively applying attainder that applied to Catherine's actions and more insidiously her intentions, Catherine may never have been executed. We also get fascinating insights into Catherine's character, something rarely introduced beyond the broad biographical strokes in many other popular histories of the period or Tudor fiction. We see Catherine's extreme aversion to being slighted, her preferred role as pursued and then empowered to end her own affairs. We see Catherine's insecurities about performing the role and duties as queen to perfection, especially since Henry's fourth wife Anne of Cleves still lives and somewhat intimidates and threatens her, and her devotion to ensuring all her public displays are executed flawlessly and gracefully. We see how a girl of little personal means (though with a good family name) immediately pays back Dereham as soon as she begins to advance at court, wishing to no longer be in debt and release ties to him and move forward to her new place in the world. We see a bit of her stubborn and cruel side in her interactions with Lady Mary, Henry's daughter, and Catherine has two of Mary's maids dismissed (again a bit outside prevailing social codes of conduct). And we also see her wish to be liked and well-regarded, and the eventual fragile truce and exchange of presents between Catherine and Mary nod to that as well. Catherine Howard is fully realized in Russell's hands: a woman in a difficult age, a woman of an important aristocratic family but neither a willing tool nor an innocent pawn of their plots for power, and her downfall a thing of circumstance, bad luck, and poor decision making in one: Russell neither blames nor absolves her, but shows perfectly how truly tragic Catherine's tale is, and how difficult it was to thrive and survive some of the schizophrenic political winds of the time (and political and personal will of the king) for a flawed human like Catherine. I'd love to read future biographies by Russell, whether Tudor centric or otherwise, and heartily recommend this book to Tudor enthusiasts looking for something new, authoritative and truly objective, in a time where so many books come with preconceived notions and evidence is outlined to reinforce existing prejudices or stacked to support one theory above all: instead take the journey with Russell and come to know Catherine Howard in life and death. -received an ARC on edelweiss thanks to Simon & Schuster...more",Notes are private!,0,91,1,"Jan 26, 2017","Jan 31, 2017","Dec 08, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29430787-young-and-damned-and-fair

Though I'm always skeptical of retellings, I usually end up reading them. P ""Thou art the shoals on which Caliban wilt dash his heart to pieces."" Though I'm always skeptical of retellings, I usually end up reading them. Perhaps some of Prospero's magic rubs off whenever The Tempest is invoked, as I loved Margaret Atwood's Hag-Seed and now have had a great experience reading Miranda and Caliban. Covering Miranda and Caliban's childhood on the island, expanding the relationships between the two of them and Prospero, and bringing us right to the titular tempest, Jacqueline Carey does a wonderful job imbuing her tale with magic and beauty, darkness and danger, echoing the dramatic nature of Shakespeare's original. Her Miranda is innocent, tender, loving, but grows wise over time, penetrating the plans of Prospero in ways we do not see in the play. And it is her Caliban on which success really rides: subverting the noble savage and dark, ugly villain tropes of the original and also delivering him from true bondage, Caliban is certainly confused and has shame about his origins and his baser impulses, but his ideas and actions are of a fully formed man with a great capacity for faithfulness and devotion and gentleness, and his worst treachery is seen as no different on the human continuum than the greedy, vengeance-driven motives of either Prospero or his brother and the king of Naples who had previously usurped the crown. ""Ah, but now that thou knowest there is more to dream, thou wilt dare to dream it,"" Ariel says softly, as softly as the wind. ""Thou shouldst not, for there is only pain in it for thee."" The love story between Miranda and Caliban begins innocently as children, and becomes complicated as each grows into adulthood and understands their respective places in the world and the futures in store for them, those both fated and fixed by Prospero. Caliban's love for Miranda (and hers for his) is both pure and passionate therefore, rooted in years of tender friendship but made urgent and impossible by a physical and soulful longing for the other. Both are at the whims and under the thumb of Prospero, pained by his magic and his cruelty for disobedience or disappointment, and as they grow up they take pleasure in each other's company and somewhat shared status in his household, though Miranda is his innocent daughter and Caliban learns to his chagrin he is thought of as a servant though he was free when he came to them and truly only serves Miranda in friendship and love. Miranda teaches Caliban to speak when they first find him; he repays this kindness when she has been stricken by her father and must learn again her own memories and knowledge. Ariel's role is both a uniter and a divider of the couple: he empowers each with information and understanding of themselves and their situations, but also warns them, an audience stand in or one man Greek chorus, of the pain and impossibility of this connection, and his binding to Prospero means he is compelled to disrupt their union as much as he chafes at his bondage and in some ways helps the two together. In Carey's hands, the island backstory of The Tempest is of star-crossed lovers worthy of Shakespeare, whose romance is doomed for a world not prepared for two disparate beings to be together, for a father with an iron grip on the outcomes and fates of others and unwilling to relinquish his plans for his daughter's freedom or happiness to her, and men who would set themselves above other men by virtue of their birth or bearing or belief in God or gods. ""'Tis the fine edge of a blade that divides innocence from ignorance, and methinks it a blade that will turn in thy hand and cut you one day."" The themes are varied and interesting here: the power and magic of words and of names, freedom and servitude both forced and unwilling and otherwise, the line between innocence and ignorance, the power and strength of woman. But all appear and exist in service to the larger plot, so Carey is thought provoking without being preachy or heavy handed. Carey draws her characters well, their Shakespearean characteristics and qualities as a strong base layer, but Carey breathes her own life into them as well: Caliban's constancy and elevation of his most positive aspects over the limited villainy he's allotted in the play, the deepening of Ariel's darker side and his role as informer and informant for the three humans of the island. Miranda asks rhetorically of Caliban, ""If a person does good in the name of bad all unwitting, surely God in his greatness must understand and forgive it?"" And indeed we weigh Caliban's and Prospero's actions from this angle and as well from the other: to what is forgiven or borne by those who do bad in the name of good? Caliban's villainy from Carey's perspective is easier to understand, though we (and Miranda) cannot excuse it: by Prospero he has been enslaved, made to think himself low and unworthy, been violently assaulted, had his life threatened, and ultimately has arranged for the one good of Caliban's life to be forever lost to him. But Prospero ""sees the entire world as a game-board, and all of us lesser beings merely pieces upon it"" and his manipulation of the life of his daughter and callous enslavement of Caliban, Ariel, and the various sprites of the island in service to a plan of both vengeance and justice (it rests on a knifes edge as to which way it will tip), we do not see Prospero as maintaining the moral high ground versus Caliban and the playing field under Carey has been leveled, even if the outcome retains its imbalance.Carey gives us some beautiful descriptions of an enchanted but also hard island upbringing, colorful and warm and emotional, from scenes in which Miranda learns not to love her animals too dearly to her encountering of paint colors in Prospero's sanctum. The writing is clear and clean prose with an air common to works of historical fiction that also fit into contemporary tone: only Ariel retains his Shakespearean way of speaking, the rest is written in a style and voice befitting Miranda as a mostly educated young woman and an illiterate but learned Caliban whose formal education was late and incomplete but reads well and plainly into the happenings of others and his own heart. With above all strong characterization and a believable and affecting story of doomed love, Jacqueline Carey's Miranda and Caliban is a very worthy retelling and reinvention and subversion of the original Shakespeare. And to have a heart break and feel pity but also pride for Shakespeare's villain, now fully fleshed into a complicated creature but a true, devoted lover of Miranda is no small feat. A definite recommended read from me.-received as an ARC on NetGalley thanks to Tor Books, in exchange for an honest ...more",Notes are private!,0,48,1,"Jan 18, 2017","Jan 20, 2017","Dec 08, 2016",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/25670396-miranda-and-caliban

But I honestly I really wanted to love Everything Belongs to Us, and perhaps that was my issue, going in with higher expectations than I should have. But I honestly felt like the characters and plot didn't start clicking with me until about halfway through, and though the second act was much stronger than the first, the ending itself was a definite let down and felt deeply unsatisfying just when I had started to care about most of the main characters. I would also say that from literary fiction, at this point I'm expecting the writing to be top notch, and I heartily look for for different styles and atmospheres, but the craft and execution should be strong. I thought the writing itself in Everything Belongs to Us fairly standard, not much transformative or particularly beautiful or well observed in the first half, though the second half was much, much stronger and more interesting and showcased Yoojin Grace Wuertz's talent. I would rate this a 3.5 star title, rounded down to 3 stars.We are introduced to the three main characters in slow succession, all university students in Seoul in the 70s: Sunam, hoping (and failing) to attain access to an upper level social club called the Circle; Jisun, the wealthy daughter of a tycoon, rebellious and bored, seeking herself in protest causes and political activism; and Namin, an ambitious, smart girl with a complicated family history wanting nothing more than to raise her family from poverty. I will say that I never responded to Sunam as a character: he felt like such a blank slate, desiring everything but working for nothing, resenting Jisun, Namin, Juno and other characters for an array of aspects and circumstances he does not possess but can't quite attain or develop either. He's weak and cowardly often, especially with regard to his relationship with Namin, in his thoughts and actions, and yet no sympathy was aroused in me for his situation. Sunam to me felt like a small minded, emotionally stunted young man, and his fate in the epilogue shows not much progress in that characterization. I grew to enjoy with some trepidation the friendship of Jisun and Namin, and I thought the characters of both girls were drawn very well, both transcending base principles of the poor little rich girl and the actually poor girl striving for more. Namin is the character that it's easy to like: she's smart, disciplined, pragmatic, focused on her family and bettering their lives, continuing a relationship with a cast off brother, supporting her wayward sister's mistakes. Jisun is less likeable, but I found it easy to sympathize with her and get a full understanding of how and why she acts as she does. Rejected by a man she loved and cast from a cause she at least mildly cared about, Jisun is a bit adrift through most of the novel, chafing at the inevitability of being her father's daughter and turning into what he wants or expects her to be. The friendship between Namin and Jisun goes through difficult patches, shown in flashbacks to adolescence, but is rocked twice in the main part of the novel, and I had genuine emotion for both girls' struggles with themselves and each other. But Sunam, the weak link for me, also plays a role in their rollercoaster friendship, which I liked less. The only other thing I can say about the writing is that typically, I'll bookmark pages and underline and highlight quotes and passages and ideas in good literary fiction, or my pace will wildly vacillate between slow savoring of what I'm reading to eagerness to read whatever comes next, not just for plot but for new concepts and turns of phrase. I really didn't get much of that from Everything Belongs to Us: the writing felt very flat, removed from the characters and proceedings, especially in the first half as the current situation and backstory is laid bare. In the second half, I found the writing to be much stronger, much tighter, with more profound ideas, better observational detail, more turns of phrase and sentences to bookmark and remark on. If the whole novel had been as good as the second half, my rating probably would have been 4 stars rather than 3. I was actually a bit bored reading the first half, taking me awhile to push on, though it did really improve at the halfway mark.Ultimately, I was a bit let down by Everything Belongs to Us, which again could have been my higher expectations more than anything; that said, it is still a good debut novel with some fine writing and characters, particularly in the second half, though it lacks a strong ending. I would recommend this with some reservations. I would be interested in other works from Yoojin Grace Wuertz, as she's demonstrated talent in this book, and hopefully future craft and edit will be tighter. If you are looking for great Korean fiction in 2017, I would start with Pachinko, a broader and yet more intimate work with beautiful writing and more memorable (IMO) characters - my  of Pachinko is here.. -Received an ARC on edelweiss, thanks to Random House....more",Notes are private!,0,55,1,"Dec 28, 2016","Jan 02, 2017","Dec 08, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/31248102-everything-belongs-to-us

This book wasn't what you thought it was. This book has always not been what you thought it would be.I felt likeThis book isn't what you think it is. This book wasn't what you thought it was. This book has always not been what you thought it would be.I felt like there were two books in White Tears, but the final, can't stop reading for anything 50 pages force the halves into sides A and B of the record, completing each other, forming a whole, forcing me to appreciate more of what had come before. Early parts are occasionally irritating but gave me enough interest as we come to know Seth and Carter and Carter's sister Leonie, get background on their backgrounds, are introduced to their passions and the personal demons that follow each of them are hinted it. Seth and Carter have graduated from a liberal arts college: Seth is our narrator, a somewhat spineless, introverted guy with a prior psychotic break in high school, and he marvels at and is made important by his friendship with rich Carter Wallace who seemingly has the world on a string and anything and everything available to him, but who is ashamed of his wealth and privilege (though not above using both carelessly and thoughtlessly) and is endlessly searching for something that will help him feel, connect, be a more authentic version of himself. Their shared love for the world of sound bind them, and then Carter's obsession with blues and preserving and recreating that music fuses Seth to him more firmly.Then something dramatic occurs - no spoilers here, better to go in a bit unprepared and green - and Kunzru shifts the ground beneath the reader's feet. It's hard to say and probably will change depending on the reader, but you'll find either the book goes off the rails, or the book finally gets onto the track it needed to be on. For me, it seemingly takes a horrifying acid trip that blurs and transcends the boundaries of time and ends up shrouded in darkness. It's disquieting, uncomfortable, violent, surreal. And it reaches its most critical, important moments in those final pages that tie what came before together, the past we can't escape and can't form to our will, no matter if we long to escape it or are obsessed with it as a more authentic, real time. While the early parts of the novel indeed invoke and discuss, American white privilege, there's an absence of black voices or authority or agency. At first I thought this was a miss on Kunzru's part, and was beginning to grow tired of the ignorance and tacit ownership Seth and Carter assume. But it turns out that erasure of the black perspective was a deliberate choice, and it comes back with a (literal and figurative) vengeance in the second half, a stinging indictment of past transgressions and present structure that perpetuates white appropriation of black culture, white exploitation of black bodies: once as slaves, then as sharecroppers and work release for petty misdemeanors, now feeding the coffers of private prisons and white wardens and owners, black bodies fueling the engine of a broken criminal justice system. And we, watching Seth, let Kunzru take us from the early perspective:We really did feel that our love of the music bought us something, some right to blackness, but by the time we got to New York, we'd learned not to talk about it. We didn't want to be mistaken for the kind of suburban white boys who post pictures of themselves holding malt liquor bottles and throwing gang signs.To later:On your record deck, you played the sound of the middle passage, the blackest sound. You wanted the suffering you didn't have, the authority you thought it would bring. It scared you, but you thought of the swagger it would put in your walk, the admiring glances of your friends. Then came the terror when real darkness first seeped through the walls of your bedroom, the walls designed to keep you safe and dreaming. And finally your rising sense of shame when you admitted to yourself that you were relieved the walls were there. The shame of knowing that you would do nothing, that you would allow it all to carry on.Kunzru's writing is quite fine, very readable even in the acid trip half of the book, with for me quite a few revelatory phrases and ideas, and some great descriptive elements. But it's that unsettling feeling and atmosphere that shook me and will stay with me. His writing explicitly and implicitly invokes the crossroads, the fine dividing line, between life and death, between sanity and madness, between existence and erasure, the various devils that serve us and take hold of us and master us. It's hard for me to rate this book: I ran through myriad reactions. But a few hours after finishing it, I am still unsettled, still disquieted, still satisfied by the weaving of the narrative and the force of the message about black erasure in our past and present. It may weigh on my mind in the most disturbing way possible for awhile. So I'll go with 4 stars. It's definitely not a book for everyone, it's for sure flawed and sometimes difficult to read but I could not put it down and it ultimately crawled under my skin.-received an ARC on edelweiss, thanks to Knopf...more",Notes are private!,0,272,1,Mar 2017,"Mar 02, 2017","Dec 05, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30780283-white-tears

My money's on The Women in the Castle.The Women in the Castle takes a very familiar subject and turns the focus on a group not typically solicited for lead roles in WWII fiction: German women, struggling on the homefront during the war and then more importantly tasked with putting themselves, their families, and a nation back together after the war, rebuilding while also understanding and acknowledging their grief and guilt. Shattuck achieves that mystical alchemy needed for a WWII novel to be book club bound and verbally passed along amongst friends and coworkers: solid storytelling, characters you're invested in, larger ideas and moral questions and engaging with history in a fresh way.Shattuck's prose is clear and accessible, nothing overly flowery or fancy, but descriptive enough to draw you into the proceedings. I had been hopping between reads, nothing fully drawing me in, until I started The Women in the Castle and was immediately hooked and then hurtled through at great speed. She is able to balance establishing characterization and storytelling elements with moving the plot forwards and backwards in time and via different perspectives. That can be a difficult thing to do, and indeed can cripple a reading experienice if poorly executed. But Shattuck's narrative descisions are easy to follow along, and become almost necessary and hungered for by the reader: she'll pull on a thread in one chapter, drop a bombshell secret in the next, making us desparate to find out how and when this all happened and she's anticipated our need to understand with an appropriate change in time and perspective. From that angle, her writing is extremely confident and successful. But her descriptions are also very well done, and her scenes can haunt you as her characters encounter subtle or blatant evil and horror of the Holocaust or the war in general.I won't go into the plot too much - the blurb is lengthy and comprehensive - but I will say that Shattuck's three lead characters are all extremely memorable women, for very different reasons. The story of their fledgling friendship out of tragedy (all are widows after the failure of Operation Valkyrie, the mission to assassinate Hitler) and the tests and strains those bonds face and undergo as they carve out collective and individual lives in the war's aftermath is as compelling as the larger tale of the defeated German nation dealing with grief and guilt post war, as wel their silence and complicity and hunger and deprevation and sexual assault and violence. Marianne, Benita, and Ania all have flaws, all fragile and doing their best to move forward from the pain incurred and endured, and not always able to completely escape it, but certainly always trying, with help of their comraderie and their love for their children. And each woman faces her past and her guilt quite differently, and judges her friend differently as well, leading to some heartbreaking conclusions and outcomes.Finally, by placing the perspectives with German women, Shattuck is somewhat inverting standard paradigms of the evil Germans who were all Nazis, and inviting us to understand through the different characters what life was like for ordinary and extraordinary Germans during this period, how some could choose to act against Hitler boldly while most either openly supported his ideas without understanding until too late what his coded language meant and the real world implications of that rhetoric and ideology being absorbed so easily and readily. And what the postwar period meant for the German people, fear of confronting their dark guilt and shame, but needing to in order to gain peace or redemption or forgiveness or something, the blame and responsibility shifting according to each character and their own history and action and inaction.While it may not quite attain the literary highs or mass adoption that All the Light We Cannot See did, The Women in the Castle is a great addition to recent WWII fiction, and from its very different vantage point feels fresh from what has come before. Well paced, plotted, and told, I think The Women in the Castle has the right ingredients to find a highly interested audience hungry for new tales from this period. Highly recommended for historical fiction fans of WWII era, and 4 stars for me. -received an ARC on edelweiss, thanks to William Morrow...more",Notes are private!,0,105,1,"Jan 22, 2017","Jan 24, 2017","Dec 05, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30653967-the-women-in-the-castle

I should start by saying though I've read Longbourn (enjoyed on the whole though it had an extremely different tone and sensibility to Austen novels, and also gave it three stars) and plan to read Eligible: A Modern Retelling of Pride and Prejudice, in general I don't gravitate towards Austen adaptations or extensions: her novels are always pretty neatly wrapped, and if I want to re-create my emotional reaction to Anne Elliott's eventual triumph after her life of undeserved slights and constant, seemingly unrequited love for Captain Wentworth in Persuasion, my personal favorite Austen novel, well, I'll just re-read Persuasion. I think fans of Austen and fans of Austen continuations/re-tellings would both enjoy this novel and perhaps critique different elements of the plot and set up.It took me a bit to get into it: the exposition is a bit rocky as Flynn needs to introduce the characters, their home time, and how they will get set up as respectable people in 1815, and the future world is hazily sketched at that point. Once I pushed past the opening and the characters (and therefore me as the reader) were fully immersed in London society, the book whizzed by. The basic premise is well stated from the blurb: two time travelers, Rachel and Liam, from an unspecified future time enter England in 1815, with a mission objective of securing Jane Austen's lost novel, ""The Watsons"". The objective changes somewhat as Rachel and Liam become more acquainted with the family, until their directive to leave the future intact clashes with their desire to save Jane, Henry, and other figures major and minor. The underlying and later explicitly stated concern is that if they make any changes however subtle, either their future will change in inconceivable ways, or they'll never be able to return, marooned from their home time. But there's also a part of both characters that ask if they even want to return, or live out their lives in Regency England. While I felt that the beginning was a bit slow to set up the conceit, the ending somewhat abrupt, and the mechanics and details of the future world and time travel only lightly explained and covered, the middle sections in which Rachel and Liam assume their identities as Mary and William Ravenswood and interact with various members of the Austen family are fun, interesting, and share some of the same sharp social observation that Jane Austen's novels commonly exhibited. Action moves from the city of London to the more bucolic Hampshire and Chawton House, echoing the town/country split settings of other Austen novels.Flynn did a fantastic job in my opinion of imaging Jane Austen both as a critical character that is the whole reason for the story, but also a strong and seemingly authentic take on a beloved but not deeply well known real-life literary figure. Her Jane both supports and subverts the portrait her family created for her after her death: smart, witty, complicated, constrained by her times but also fully of them, easy to trace her most enduring heroines to portions of her personality, but being far more multi-faceted than her fictional creations. Because her Jane really worked for me, the main body of the novel also worked for me, and I found myself truly interested in the developing friendship between Rachel/Mary and Jane.Flynn also takes part of the traditional Austen ""marriage plot"" and adds it to her storyline as well: Rachel as Mary Ravenswood attracts the interest of Jane's brother Henry, and their attraction and Henry's friendship with Liam/William help to develop relations with Jane, Cassandra and the rest of the Austen family. In some ways it can be a little repetitive and not always as well done as in the original Austen works (secret engagement! family scandal! financial ruin!) But it wouldn't be Austen without our heroine further examining her own thoughts, feelings, and beliefs and arriving at new ideas about herself during the course of said marriage plot, and the dual foils of Henry and Liam serve to do that for Rachel. The progression of both love stories makes sense relative to the larger plot and to Austen, and I liked how Flynn could compare the traditional courtship of Regency England with ""Mary"" and Henry to the growing feelings of Rachel and Liam from a future social interaction perspective, while still being able to situate both in the larger story.I suppose what I liked most in a general sense is that this book does so well to both discuss and capture the imagination and observation behind Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, and the other works of Austen's oeuvre, without having to do any modern adapting or extending the lives of literary characters that can be received very differently by each reader. The writing is good on the whole, again better with exposition and dialogue as regards the Regency parts, and on Rachel's inner thoughts and changing perspectives, less strong for me for future pieces. Flynn plays in Austen's sandbox without messing with her creations, and her Jane is well imagined, so the Austen fan is fairly satisfied with these results. I do wish the modern elements - the time travel science and implications and even the world(s) Rachel and Liam came/come from - were as well developed as the Regency period part of the story, and the ending really did feel a bit rushed, a bit abrupt, and not quite as final as I would have liked (nor as final as Austen would sign off her novels for her heroines). But it was still an enjoyable read, and one I would recommend for fans of Austen and especially those who read the Austen re-tellings and extended tales like Death Comes to Pemberley, Longbourn, Eligible: A Modern Retelling of Pride and Prejudice and other, those who crave more, more, more Austen: these time travelers do too. Though I'll probably never need or want to re-read this: it's enjoyable but not overly memorable, especially in comparison to being able to continually delight in the pleasures of Persuasion and the rest of Austen's work....more",Notes are private!,0,51,1,"Dec 04, 2016","Dec 11, 2016","Dec 04, 2016",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/31371280-the-jane-austen-project

But I found a free copy, so I read it over a few hours in between two more heavy reads to get a different vibe going. The base plot: family of four preps elite gynsmist teen daughter for critical competition, all the while dealing with the death and/or murder of a member of their larger gymnastic family that has Katie, the matriarch, uncovering new and unwelcome evidence about her daughter, her husband, and what she thinks she knows about her family.The psychological portion worked very well for me. Abbott maintains a creepy and uncomfortable atmosphere on the whole, and the story and characters were constantly leaving a peculiar, unsettled sensation in my stomach as I followed them on their journey. All of the characters are very well drawn: flawed, deeply mixed bags of humanity that are very compelling in terms of how they behave with each other and what their motivations are and why. The relationships between mother and daughter, father and daughter, daughter and peers (I'd hestitate to call them friends in Devon's case) are sharply observed and rang very true and authentic. I also liked the representation of the fanaticism of the world of elite gymnastics, how an average family could get sucked into sport so deeply, and want success and greatness for their child so much they could compromise any number of things to achieve those ends.Where Abbott lost me a bit was in the thriller parts of the narrative, which though the whys behind various other decisions and actions were more important and interesting, the resolution of who killed Ryan and why I felt was fairly weak. I could see the answer to the whodunit part a million miles away (view spoiler)[ (pretty early on, I figured out Devon was responsible, even with the red herrings that lead Katie and presumably the reader to falsely suspect Hailey and Eric)  (hide spoiler)] and some of the ""twists"" I felt were telegraphed and therefore not very shocking. I kept waiting for some other crazy twist with Drew's scarlet fever, that's how much I was looking for something, anything to surprise me. Abbott's writing is also a bit awkward occasionally for my taste: her powerful way of showcasing the inner workings of a mind or a relationship are strong, but from third person of Katie's perspective, the random shifts in time could be jarring and the narrative beats were very staccato as well, so I could never quite get the rhythm of the storytelling. I think this style choice helped sometimes create the uneasy mood, but it did force me a bit at arms length with the characters and proceedings.Overall a solid, entertaining novel that is quick to devour but also uncomfortable to read. I'd probably not go out of my way to pick up something else by Megan Abbott, but if something else of hers crossed my path I'd leaf through it, confident in her psychological profiling abilities of teen girls and family relationships.

While the writing is fairly strong overall, I would only rate this 2.5 stars (rounded down to be an ""it was ok"" overall rating) because one of the perspectives is far superior to the other, and the ending seemed implausible and somewhat inauthentic, which changed my opinion from a solid 3 star to a more lukewarm rating.The novel is told from two perspectives. Beauty, a Xhosa schoolteacher, is a very well drawn character. I was immersed in her story line and character from the beginning, especially since it's told first person present tense so I felt real immediacy with her thoughts and emotions: from her perspective, the reader is on the front lines of the Soweto Uprising, and I had great sympathy and admiration for her decision to leave her young sons in the care of family and move illegally to Johannesburg to track down her freedom fighter daughter who disappeared after the protest turned deadly. Marais avoids traps and potential backlash that other books like The Help (to which this is compared) fell into, in terms of how the black protagonists are given voices and written in such a way as to sound/seem inferior: Beauty's inner strength, her serene but sharp intellect, and the depth of her emotional understanding are all very well presented. She's a fully realized character, and we see just how dignified and powerful she can be as she takes on a domestic position to care for the fragile Robin in a gentle, firm manner (that enables her to have a pass to stay in Johannesburg while searching for her daughter).By contrast, I never fully connected with Robin as a character or narrator. I think my main issue was that her daily tales weren't as urgent or compelling as Beauty's, but there was also a stylistic choice that increased distance with that character. Robin is 10 years old during the main story and her perspective is told in first person past tense, but her perspective, voice, reflections and thoughts shift haphazardly between the ten-year-old Robin and the adult Robin looking back on the events of the novel. Robin's fragility and fear of desertion following the murder of her parents (in a random act of black vengeance following the Soweto Uprising) are presented well, but I didn't get as much of the rest of her fledgling personality before or after that horrific event. So I never felt as immersed in her emotions and thoughts as I did Beauty's, especially because it would swing from those of a child to an adult who had long processed these events within the same paragraph.I did think Marais did a very good job of showing agency and empowerment and friendship in 1970s South Africa across a large and diverse backdrop of main and secondary characters. And though I found Beauty's perspective more interesting overall, when her story and Robin's aligned in the second half of the novel, I was really chugging along and enjoying what I was reading. Robin and Beauty's daily lives in Edith's Johannesburg flat and the dinner parties with friends reveal the less known plight and discrimination of homosexuals and Jews in South Africa, and the tense, creepy exchanges Beauty has with varying shadowy figures in the pursuit of her daughter are written nicely. I thought this would be a three star  right up until I arrived at the climax and conclusion of the novel.Robin makes a critical, selfish decision, and then reveals her error with devastating consequences for Beauty. Robin's motivation for making that choice were well understood from her earlier circumstances and fear of alienation and desertion. What bothered me was the ensuing path to redemption and resolution. (view spoiler)[ Robin, this fragile, ten year old white child, commandeers a drunk Colored man to drive her into a dangerous area of Johannesburg, confront a group of African freedom fighters, speaks Xhosa to them and does a traditional dance to convince them of her honesty and goodness, then finds Beauty's daughter in a different home, gets her to come back with her, evades a dangerous leader/gangster Shakes who shoots at them  (hide spoiler)]. It felt very improbable that this sequence of events could actually occur, and while prior I felt Marais had been very even handed with agency and power, at the final hour Robin assumes the role of white hero to bring Beauty's daughter to her senses and reunite mother and daughter. (view spoiler)[ We're even left hanging as to Beauty's fate and how her reunion with her beloved daughter turns out: it's from Robin's perspective and she just cuts the scene off and runs to her absentee aunt Edith, suddenly now her true home.  (hide spoiler)] Overall, the ending left a less pleasant taste in my mouth, both because of how far-fetched it seemed to be (it really felt like something out of a political thriller albeit with a ten year old in the starring role) and because I felt more justice could and should have been done to the ending of Beauty's story, instead of sidelining her dramatically to let Robin save the day.Ultimately, I have read and will read much stronger South African-set fiction and nonfiction: this was just ok, and I'd never re-read it or pass on to anyone I know personally. The blurb does compare this title to The Help: if you liked Stockett's book and have interest in apartheid era South Africa, this could be a read for you (though I found the overall writing better in The Help than in this one). But I'd prioritize other titles dealing with similar subject matter first....more",Notes are private!,0,57,1,"Dec 02, 2016","Dec 04, 2016","Dec 01, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/32739413-hum-if-you-don-t-know-the-words

Let me start off by saying this is not a perfect book and it certainly won't work for everyone. In fact, I don't know anyone I would personally recommend it to. But I really, really enjoyed reading this, and even if it ultimately boils down to being a fun, somewhat forgettable thriller with a different layer of intelligence and elitism, it was what I'd call a nerdy guilty pleasure and something that grabbed me unexpectedly. I enjoyed the characters and their descent into grief and guilt, and I loved the shifting lines between the actors the characters inhabited and their own personas (and loved all the Shakespeare). I'd say this is 3.5 stars, rounded up to 4 stars for how much fun I ended up having (even if it's a dark tale).""All the world’s a stage,/And all the men and women merely players;/They have their exits and their entrances,/And one man in his time plays many parts""Oliver, James, Wren, Alexander, Richard, Meredith, and Filippa are in their senior year of an exclusive performing arts college, and the only fourth year students in the acting group, having survived years of attrition and thinning of the ranks, until only this core group were deemed worthy and remained. Each has their distinctive place and typecasting in the corps: Richard, the magnetic star and leader; Meredith, the siren and sexpot and dangerous woman; Wren, the ingenue; James, the good guy; Alexander, Filippa, and Oliver (our narrator) the flexible players moving across roles and the secondary stars. Rio doesn't linger long on what was, but gives a good overall sense of their camaraderie, familiarity, and comfort with each other and the various roles they occupy on stage and as friends in real life. ""Between the acting of a dreadful thing/And the first motion, all the interim is/Like a phantasma or a hideous dream.""Their directors/instructors begin to push the group to more fully articulate, share, and explore their strengths, weaknesses, and limitations, and for a group of theater actors used to wearing masks and inhabiting other characters at all times, this public revealing of one's true face and full honesty puts cracks and dents in the glass houses they've built that contain the basis of their friendship and conceal parts of themselves from each other. Then, in an effort to make them transcend their limitations, the Halloween production of Macbeth is cast against type, against their previously default roles and pecking order, which completely changes the nature of their relationships with each other, and alienates and estranges one (view spoiler)[ Richard  (hide spoiler)] of the seven from the other six.“These violent delights have violent ends/And in their triumph die, like fire and powder/Which, as they kiss, consume”""False face must hide what the false heart doth know""Things escalate when (view spoiler)[Richard (hide spoiler)] begins to react angrily and violently to the upended order, and then the others begin to conspire to thwart those actions. Then, one pivotal night, the six make the fateful decision not to save the mortally wounded one from an apparent accident. What was action and inaction chosen and done to protect the six ends up becoming their undoing, as the six struggle to feel whole or at peace with their choice, and each ends up being consumed by their self-hate and fear and disgust in different ways. As the police begin to investigate the death, and Oliver too begins uncovering evidence of foul play, walls are erected and broken down between the remaining friends, and some secrets and hidden truths are revealed. From the outset, we know that Oliver has been incarcerated for 10 years, and time is split between the bulk of the narrative in the past, and the present where Oliver and the lead detective retrace steps and confront the truth head on. What we don't know is who was or wasn't the actual culprit and why. But again, the whodunit is less meaningful than the change, disintegration and renewal of these bonds of friendship between the remaining six, and how each processes their grief and guilt on stage and off. It will come/Humanity must perforce prey on itself/Like monsters of the deep.""It's an ambitious novel, and the execution can be a bit unwieldy at times. It's high drama (as befitting a performing arts college and the actor class) and higher education, which could turn some readers off. But I liked this group of flawed performers, less pompous and snobby than their elite theater credentials would suggest, and definitely all with demons and sharp edges but also vulnerability, fear, anguish. And Oliver as the narrator may begin as a bit of a cipher, but as he moves out of his friend/sidekick bit player typecasting and into more important roles, he also uncovers more of his own confidence, his own true feelings, and the depths of his own violence and rage. The writing is quite fine on the whole: very good to weave together the actor-y bits and the thriller-y bits, though the lines created and composed by Rio are not memorable in and of themselves, especially since she's up against all the Shakespearean classic lines being bandied about. And the Shakespeare! Granted, it's probably better to see Shakespeare performed as opposed to reading about it, but M. L. Rio's background in theater really serves her well in bringing major Shakespearean plays to life, with the stagecraft and acting elements and also how the characters internalize and utilize Shakespeare in their every day lives (and how it ultimately informs their predicament). That's probably the biggest issue for Rio, in terms of Shakespeare's language being so much more powerful and important than her own, and though she uses it for her own ends to advance the plot and develop the characters, it still diminishes her own writing ultimately (versus say Margaret Atwood who in Hag-Seed managed to display her own genius and Shakespeare's simultaneously without his language diminishing her own, IMO and my  of that here).Overall, I liked this a lot and was surprised by my level of enjoyment and involvement while reading it. And while the characters and plot points may not stay with me, some of the larger ideas just might. If you don't enjoy Shakespeare, this is not the book for you. Steer clear! But if you're into thrillers of a different color and do enjoy The Bard, this could be the book you're looking for. And if you're anything like me, I now want to go re-read Macbeth, Richard III, Romeo and Juliet, King Lear and read for the first time Julius Caesar, and revel in more of Shakespeare's wondrous world.""And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover/To entertain these fair well-spoken days/I am determined to prove a villain/And hate the idle pleasures of these days""...more",Notes are private!,0,80,1,"Dec 04, 2016","Dec 05, 2016","Dec 01, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30319086-if-we-were-villains

Book I is dedicated to the escape of the Minyae (Argonauts) and the pursuit by Medea's father Aeetes, as she ruminates on what she has done (murder her brother and put pieces of him calculatingly into the sea to halt her fathers pursuit) and what she would and will do for Jason and for her own freedom and ascension, and their arrival at Jason's home of Iolcos. Book II brings us to her most powerful and desperate time, her trickery to ensure the death of Pelias so Jason can reclaim his rightful throne, his failure to act and their removal to Corinth, Jason's withdrawal of love and protection for her and their children, and the entrance of Glauce, usurper of Jason's heart and need for conquest. Her revenge upon Jason is not without horrible pain and loss for Medea as well, and her split second decision to murder her sons is no less agonizing than in Euripides' tragedy. This is a novel concerned with agency, freedom, loyalty, power, and immortality, what it means to be remembered in your own time and all times and why and how that occurs. Though it's not perfect, I found this to be a singular, powerful, haunting and gorgeous read, and gave it 5 stars.Jason would erase Medea. Use her to claim a victory, to claim dominion over barbarian lands, use her to bear children, his heirs, of royal lineage on both sides, then cast her away to be forgotten. She knows he would do this, and this is what she must make impossible. She clings to him now, suspended over the deck, lost in pleasure, but she won't forget. This is another retelling of an ancient tale, and the second I've read this month after Colm Toibin's House of Names. What makes Bright Air Black stand out is who is telling it and how it's being told. Everything is from a third person perspective centered on Medea, and it's all told in present tense. Many individual lines are these short bursts with uneven rhythm and tempo, a bit strange at first until you realize you're pulled into the web of Medea's thoughts, instincts, emotions. And she is both base and wise, human but something more, so her stream of consciousness and torrent of feelings are mirrored in Vann's prose. This is a read to submit to and submerge beneath, best to read in one sitting to get your bearings and then dive in. And it's not overly long, but it is oppressively dark and sinister and sad, which can make it difficult to turn the page and move inexorably to the ending we all know is coming, even Medea to an extent, though she does what she can to avert it, empower herself, and occasionally believe in her love for Jason though she believes in her own strength and will more. The writing is clipped but charged, little lightning bolts of description and dialogue. And there are small breaks between scenes, but no real chapters other than the Book I and II split. We are borne upon Medea's mind and action as she is borne upon the Argo, and just as her days and nights seem endless, so too does the writing stretch and flow. It makes for a very unique reading experience that once I was into, I could not interrupt, though I can see how the style may not work for everyone. She would be a wrath much larger. She would decimate all. And she wonders why this is. Rage, but others feel rage. The difference in her is that nothing will hold her back. She will do what is monstrous, because monstrous is only the absence of a lie, the great lie if what we are to each other, wife and husband, daughter and father, sister and brother, subject and king. In the absence of that lie, a great freedom, any action possible. It's interesting that when I first heard the tale of Jason and the Argonauts, or Jason and the Golden Fleece, Medea is a secondary character, a helper to Jason and desperately in love with him, only to go mad when he puts her aside and enact terrible wrongs upon him. But for Euripides, and now for Vann, Medea is central, important in her own right, owed for being the true deliverer of the Argonauts safely home from their quest, yet despised and feared and not celebrated by any of them, including Jason. And in Bright Air Black we see some of it is of her own doing: playing up her devotion to Hekate, spitting blood at the men, belittling and swearing at most of them during the journey. This comes out of her need for freedom and desire for domination, but also fear of slavery, of servitude, of being made less than what she is and turned simply into a woman, to be dismissed and downtrodden and disposed of at the whim of a man, be it her father, brother, Pelias, Creon, or Jason. She sees them value and worship gods for these unbelievable actions, so she takes them in hand and is her own god to imbue fear and deference in them. She's complex and always has been, a primal force of nature, a maelstrom of emotion, but also has in her the same basic qualities we all have in ourselves. There's also a proto-feminist message here, as Medea refuses to be enslaved by her societal or natural instincts to suborn herself to the will of men. She's tested by those impulses as they flee her father and she is tempted to bring her brother back to life and rebuild their family, and again as Jason is ready to put her aside and she questions if she should submit, go easy, for the sake of her children be spurned and cast out.  She will not be mastered. If it is natural to be a slave, she will be unnatural.  Medea's darkness is of human origin, and she is partially pushed into malice and cruelty by those forces that would see her bound and restrained. And as Vann has us seeing the world of the Greeks through her perspective, we are able to empathize with her emotions, if not always her actions. If enough people repeat the stories for long enough, Jason will become something that cannot die, but he also will have been erased, because the actions are too large and impersonal. The stories will reveal nothing about the real man that lived. Medea would have something more personal, something remembered and caught and frozen that can only be her, some moment none can fully understand or forget. Vann's words about Medea's views about herself and her husband are ultimately proved accurate: in the modern age Jason is remembered as a sort of hero, lesser than those that followed, but without real connection to his character, and in myth he dies alone and unloved and forsaken, crushed under the dilapidated Argo. And Vann gives us a Jason who is young, willful, capricious, knowing less about power than his wife and never truly desiring to rule. Meanwhile Medea lives on, in myth and modern scholarship and now in David Vann's meditative novel Bright Air Black, feared and abhorred and remembered for her actions against her own children and her dark power, but also understood, contemplated, allotted complexity of character and motive. She is feared for her powers, but also underestimated many times over for being a woman, which proves that those men who become her enemies are taken unawares by their adversary, even and especially Jason. Vann's retelling is worthy of the source material, in substance and especially in style. I'd give this 4.5 stars overall, rounding up to 5. It's not a perfect read: I felt the ending was a bit too abrupt, with little delving into a Medea's psyche after committing fillicide, and I would have preferred less time spent on the Argo to get more from Medea in Iolcos or Corinth or even Athens (that phase of her life does not appear). But overall, I thought this was well done, extremely unique, a most worthy retelling and a beautiful piece of art. I highly recommended for enthusiasts of Greek mythology, with an understanding that you are getting a contemporary spin on an old tale done in an epic, lyrical style, and that the overall feeling is black as night and may take you to your own dark places while reading it.-received as an ARC via Netgalley, in exchange for an honest , thanks to Grove Atlantic ...more",Notes are private!,0,73,1,"Jan 25, 2017","Jan 26, 2017","Dec 01, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/30316145-bright-air-black

It's a sweeping, multi-generational Despite this being a 480 pg mini brick of a book, I absolutely flew through Pachinko on two commutes and a night. It's a sweeping, multi-generational epic of a Korean family, and we follow their collective and individual rises and falls, triumphs and failures, in 19010 - 1930 in Korea under Japanese occupation, and in Japan from 1930 - 1989 as expatriates and Zainichi Koreans. The characters are memorable, well-drawn, and their circumstances and hurdles extremely compelling, from family shame of out of wedlock pregnancy to hunger and pride and war-time privations. Min Jin Lee does a phenomenal job of weaving the stories of the individuals of the Baek/Bando family within the larger Korean immigrant experience in Japan and commenting on their social and political exclusion and discrimination, all the while tying it together with beautiful, descriptive prose that pulled me in and kept me turning the pages faster and faster. I was eager to learn more and follow these family members further, but I also wanted to the story to go on as long as possible. It's ambitious, and Lee pulls it off masterly in my opinion. Four stars from me: not an instant classic I'll put on my immediate re-read list, but I wouldn't be surprised if I do pick it up again in the years to come.There are so many great ideas floating throughout - what makes a nation? where is home? who is your family and what lines of loyalty do you follow? to pass, or to be defiantly (or shamefully) what one is? shame versus forgiveness - but Lee never hits these ideas over the head explicitly: they come to life in the thoughts, actions, and dialogue of the characters, softly and subtly at times but ultimately unmistakable. There's a lot to unpack on an intellectual level, and though I knew some things about the Japanese occupation and horrifying sexual slavery of Korean (and other occupied Asian) women as wartime ""comfort women"" and other pieces of the complex, complicated Japan-Korea historical relationship that only in recent years is beginning to fully normalize, I was consistently learning new ideas and words and concepts I'd never heard of prior, but these were introduced well and explained within the context of the story, so I hoovered up the information easily and eagerly. It's the family that provides the emotional push to read. I found Lee's style to change slightly as the setting and time period change, from beautiful but simple, quiet prose during the 1910 - 1930 portion on the little, provincial island of Yeong-do in Korea, to maintaining its beauty but upping the punch and zip as the family changes location to Japan and enters the modern era, with the eerie, looming mood of pre and during WWII giving way to a slightly more upbeat and fresh tone with the family's bettered circumstances in 1950 - 1989, but tempered by their Korean background and outsider, unwanted status in Japan. The simple kindness of Hoonie whom kicks off the family but we never get to know well, and his strong, smart wife Yangjin; the quiet grace and devotion of Kyunghee and her husband Yoseb's evolution from man of strength and shame to fraility and greater shame; the endurance and resolution of Sunja, the engimatic, sometimes villianous but also pitiable Koh Hansu, the Christian paragon and family renewer Isak; the goodhearted, bold Mozasu as a foil to his studious, solemn half-brother Noa and their comparative experiences of passing in Japan and how they experience and internalize shame (for different familial reasons in addition to their shared Korean heritage)... the Baek/Bandos are a layered, loving bunch with some difficult relationships between them but all sharing a passion to succeed, to carve out a home and a family, to be an example (most of the time) of good, hardworking Koreans in Japan, to transcend their marginalization and be seen, be worthy.I would heartily recommend this to lovers of family and historical epics of varying lengths, lovers of beautiful but easy reading prose and where lots of plot and events are occurring but the writing is calm so you don't feel overwhelmed by the action, and those with an interest in Japanese and Korean-set historical fiction and really getting a painless education into a complex political and cultural connection. ...more",Notes are private!,0,232,1,Dec 2016,"Dec 02, 2016","Nov 20, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29983711-pachinko

There is no intimacy without consequence. To get it out of the way, there's a lot of set up in All Our Wrong Todays, and it took me a bit to find a feel for this book and fall into it. But once Mastai gets past the set up and things are happening, the smart, funny prose and more realized characters propelled me forward, and even if the stakes and thrills aren't seemingly as high as in Dark Matter (to which this will be inevitably compared, and I'm guilty too), it's so well written and fresh and does time travel well but doesn't rely on it for its overall success, hitting the familiar beats but also introducing new concepts and ideas. And this book worked me on an emotional level: I laughed, I cried (seriously), I rooted for success and cowered in moments of failure. I do think that books work differently for different people depending on so many factors: mood, personal life, setting, etc. The book has its own strengths and weaknesses, but it's the individual reader who determines how these things coalesce or not into a whole, and the reader's particular background at the moment of experience is critical to informing what the reader brings to the book. So for me, All Our Wrong Todays was exactly the right read at the right time for my raw, sad, flailing self seeing the ending of one world and the dawning of an unknown future that simply feels wrong. All Our Wrong Todays wears its heart and brain on its sleeve, and by the end I was completely charmed, captivated, and bowled over with feeling. Death is slippery. Our minds can't latch onto it. Over time, you learn to accommodate the gap in your life that the loss opens up. Like a black hole, you know it's there because it's the spot from which no light escapes. And there's the sinewy exhaustion, the physical toll of grief that you just can't seem to sleep away. The intro is the tough bit: where a lot of the science behind the conceit is laid out, where we're exposed to the version of 2016 we all ""should"" be living in, where our protagonist (and the person who totally screwed up existence for all of us) Tom Barren introduces himself, his family, his world, and all the circumstances that lined up just so for his world to be created, and then for him to completely undo everything in a rash move out of grief and pettiness. These early parts are difficult going, and I stopped reading the novel for awhile and had to restart because I couldn't quite get into it. Tom is a bit pathetic on the whole, and since the perspective is first person, he comes off very whiny, mostly clueless, and seems like a hapless half-wit overall. That said, the writing is good, and sometimes we get early glimpses at Tom's expanded observational and emotional capacity. But until he finally moves back in time, and then is shot forward into the future, after having (somewhat unknowingly) changed critical moments from his history, we're at a high concept stage with somewhat shaky execution. People talk about grief as emptiness, but it's not empty. It's full. Heavy. Not an absence to fill. A weight to pull. Your skin caught on hooks chained to rough boulders made of all the futures you thought you would have. How do you keep five decades of love from souring into a snakebite that makes your own heart the threat, drawing the poison up and down the length of you? Once Tom awakens in ""our"" version of 2016 though, everything began firing on all cylinders for me. Tom himself matures in how he thinks and interacts with others, and ""our"" versions of Tom's family and the love of his life/lives Penelope are so much more dynamic, interesting, and fully present in the narrative. They wrestle with Tom's confusion and alienation in real, funny, and emotional ways. And ultimately it's the characters I responded to most: no spoilers since it's in the blurb, but the alternate family and soul mate of our 2016 are so well drawn, to the point that I better understood the earlier, sketchier set up of the ""true"" family, to better serve as foils for the versions from our universe the reader will respond to. Greta, Penny, and Tom's mother are all really fun characters to see Tom interact with, and while Penny and Tom's mother have counterparts that we can contrast them to (mostly very favorably), Greta is a unique creation to ""our"" universe, and brings so much to the table as a character and in some ways as a plot device. It's Greta's singularity and the key differences between the versions of the characters that forces Tom to re-think ""fixing"" his mistake, and makes his assertion of his personality over that of his alternate self so key, and later leads to his ability to accept the various aspects of himself and of varying realities. ""What I'm saying is, my imagination is trained, ok? I've considered many other lives that I could be living instead of this one. I've luxuriated in what seemed at the time to be outrageously improbable possibilities for who I could be instead of who I am. And now you show up, telling me all the dopey, delusional fantasies I harbored as a frustrated adolescent and sheepish adult were, what, unambitious? That the life I'm supposed to lead is so far beyond anything I was even capable of imagining for myself? That I'm a fucking lioness living like a mouse?"" I won't talk too much about the plot, other than to say that as Tom grapples with what he's done, and then discovers that others may have messed with timelines as well, he has to figure out what he's willing to do, who he's willing to lose, to set things right. And what is right anymore? And is doing what's right what's best for Tom, or for Lionel, or for Penny, or for the millions who exist in the ""true"" 2016, or for the millions who exist in ""our"" 2016? And that's when Tom finally steps into the shoes of a hero (somewhat), though Mastai doesn't do it in a hackneyed or trite way. It's a smart, circular climax and resolution, as befitting our temporal anchor and the larger worlds we've been navigating throughout.I'll also say that the writing and references are fun, witty, sly, engaging. It's no accident that Tom's love across two versions of reality is Penelope/Penny: much like Odysseus, Tom toils and makes substantive efforts to return to the woman he loves. The Kurt Vonnegut as master philosopher in one version of the universe is a great nod to that writer's influence on Mastai, and even the meta novel within a novel and memoir within a novel tropes get played with lightly and to good effect in All Our Wrong Todays. There's a love of writing, and of words that Mastai himself and his characters embrace fully in the novel, and hopefully some of the quotes I've worked in throughout help to displaying his talent. In principle, I realize that heroism demands sacrifice. But I didn't understand what I'd actually have to sacrifice. Write a list of the things you can't imagine giving up and that's the list of things you'll be forced to lose. Except you couldn't even draw up the list, because they're all the things you take for granted as essential elements of yourself. They don't seem removable from what makes you who you are. Bottom line: I loved the writing and found it engaging and well observed once getting past the somewhat clunky exposition. I really liked the characters, Tom growing on me as he grew in the novel, and his family and loved ones were very compelling, and the depths of his attachment to all versions of them left no doubt that he would do everything in his power to fight for them, for all of them. And mostly, the ideas of what life one should or shouldn't be living, causality and choice, luck and ambition and drive, love over everything... the ideas are peppered in throughout which for me led to an emotionally charged read. I'm probably a 4.5 stars because of how much I really enjoyed this, but wouldn't be five stars since it was a bit touch and go at first if I could make it through the first third of the novel. Overall, a great read I'd recommend, most certainly for fans of literary sci-fi or general fiction readers who don't mind sci-fi, knowing that it uses time travel as a framing device for contemporary fiction. For fans of Dark Matter, this is not a thriller like that book was: it's slower, less twist-y, less dangerous, and in some ways plays with lower stakes since it's the fate of the universe we deal with here, not one intimate man and woman and child, so it may not be for you. But I could absolutely see people who enjoyed Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore or Station Eleven liking this read: high concept, fantastic writing, a love of all things literary, and compelling ideas about human nature and life and love, with a bold dash of the speculative....more",Notes are private!,0,91,1,"Nov 20, 2016","Dec 12, 2016","Nov 20, 2016",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/27405006-all-our-wrong-todays

As an enthusiastic reader and bibliophile, I thoroughly enjoyed this book, though I might find its ability to be recommended to family and friends a bit more limited than Schwalbe's last book The End of Your Life Book Club: this one really is for book lovers, more casual readers and enthusiasts might find it harder to connect with. But for those who already embrace or believe in the idea that books can make you more empathetic, open you to the world and look at it with fresh eyes and a new perspective, challenge and change you, this book is for you. Each chapter is dedicated to a different title and related concept illustrated in said title that Schwalbe is looking to discuss and explore. The first title he cites, The Importance of Living, is threaded throughout the work, as many of Lin Yutang's ideas about how to simply exist and be at peace and joyful throughout one's life work with the messages from other tales. Not all of the chapters and books cited Schwalbe gives equal weight or as nuanced or poignant or important an anecdote or life learning (The Girl on the Train chapter felt a bit slight and maybe superfluous, and the The Taste of Country Cooking bit was interesting but didn't work as well for me). But many of the chapters are incredibly enjoyable, and involved books I know and love, or books I've now added to my growing to be read pile: What I Talk About When I Talk About Running, Gift from the Sea, Bird by Bird: Some Instructions on Writing and Life, The Importance of Living. And Schwalbe is able to showcase some of the fantastic writing by these authors, while still showing his own chops and his quiet, insightful prose as he takes us through personal memories and stories that illustrate the smaller and larger messages and ideas.Overall a very nice read, and probably particularly relevant for many readers on Goodreads, where the raison d'etre is more or less a community of people asking each other, ""what are you reading?""...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Dec 18, 2016","Dec 21, 2016","Nov 14, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30211956-books-for-living

Intangible, yes, but also the building blocks of self-preservation, renewal : These are the most durable possesions I have. If Vaddey Ratner's debut In the Shadow of the Banyan was an emotional and beautifully written read (if sometimes structurally weak), Ratner's follow up continues to showcase her lush and gorgeous writing while also delivering a more complicated, less autobiographical, and ultimately a stronger total package of a second novel. I'd give this a solid four stars: I really liked it, though it could be slowly paced in some parts. Music of the Ghosts still invokes the shadow and horrors of the period of war and genocide during American bombing and the Khmer Rouge regime, but it is first and foremost focused on what survival means for those who escaped but also lost everything, what it means to remember and to forget, what it means to forgive others and oneself, how the Cambodian people (and humans more broadly) can be broken apart and brutalized but can also heal hurts together and move forward, setting free the ghosts that haunt us to be peaceful spirits.  ""We've become adept not so much as escaping punishment but at escaping reflection. We fear to plumb the dark and see ourselves in it, the role we played in its creation, because if we go to that depth again we may not be able to resurface, to return to light."" The two main characters, Teera and the Old Man (Tun) are solid but are also vessels for Ratner to ask her questions and search for answers. Teera the younger expatriate who returned to Cambodia after the death of her last surviving relative, her aunt, the only other person to escape death during the conflict. Teera's conflict is about coming to terms with her homeland and her Cambodian identity, something she's struggled with after losing nearly her entire family as a child and forging a new life abroad. Returning to Cambodia means facing her loss, grief, and anger, at herself, her family, the nation. The Old Man's story meanwhile deals with loss but also with guilt, as he has committed wrongs during the past conflict, and is ambivalent about forgiving himself, let alone allowing others to forgive him. The two come together, and Ratner weaves their pasts and presents into the narrative, and we shift through time to see how various actions and ideas have rippled into the present day. There are rich layers of historical detail, and information about the conflict I was completely unaware of, all of which is tied up in Ratner's evocative and sumptuous prose. And it's not necessarily her descriptions of places or things that are so lush, though I could fairly well picture the various locations in Cambodia past and present that the characters inhabit. Rather, it's the inner worlds and souls of these characters and the nation, in dialogue, in action and reaction, in storytelling that is so well developed and has such a sharp emotional impact. I think that's why I'd rate this four stars: I never forgot that these characters were instruments for Ratner's ideas, so they don't stand as well of their own two feet as individuals I won't forget or cared about. But I was drawn to what and how they thought and expressed themselves, and what and how those ideas and emotions meant in a larger context for the Cambodian people and humanity as a whole. In the absence of sight, when all is dark around you, it takes a deep-seated faith that others will answer your appeal, that their humanity will rise to meet your lifted hand, your raised hope, and in that brief moment, you cross the otherwise arbitrary divide between death and life. Overall, I'm very happy to have read Vaddey Ratner's follow up to In the Shadow of the Banyan. Music of the Ghosts continues to showcase her talent, and also proves that she can inhabit other characters as well as she was able to fictionalize her own history in her debut. I recommend this for literary fiction fans of a slowly paced but beautifully written read, one that asks a lot of questions and presents a number of ideas about guilt and forgiveness and life, and certainly an interest in 20th century history in Southeast Asia or Southeast Asian culture will help. And again, the characters themselves are less important or memorable as I might want them to be, but their stories, their suffering, their survival and rebirth are very emotionally impactful, and Ratner's language and ideas will stay with me for some time.-received a egalley on edelweiss thanks to Touchstone / Simon & Schuster ...more",Notes are private!,0,48,1,"Jan 17, 2016","Jan 21, 2017","Nov 14, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30753802-music-of-the-ghosts

The novel centers around Kate, pulling herself from the despondency caused by a tough break up and academic failure. Kate is the fulcrum, and we orbit around her and the lives of her sister and college friends, and as she accepts a position in admissions at Hudson Day School, the lives of the privileged New York parents and children jockeying for position and status in the rigorous application process for 6th grade.I'm not sure whether it's the writing or the characterization, but the main adults whose lives we're peeking into never really rose to become characters I cared about or was even truly interested in - this despite the fact that I am in a personally similar situation to Kate's at the beginning of the novel. Kate is a bit of a cipher: awkward, intelligent (though mostly told that and only sometimes shown that), beautiful without trying, you never really feel her despair enough in the beginning to truly root for her to succeed, in part because it already feels like a foregone conclusion that she will find herself and (probably) find a new, better fit man for her. Vicki is the ambitious, gorgeous, shallow striver who gives tough love and breaks girl code and ultimately amounts to little more than a beautiful cold bitch stereotype (although at least her ambition is made clear, even if it is presented as a double edge sword). Chloe is the one we could be most interested in since she has the most amount of emotion and thought (and is the more plain one of the three deliberately), but Poeppel shifts her perspective to first person with her parts, and she's mostly on the outside of the entire proceedings even though we have small opportunities to get directly in her head. Amy Poeppel has a knack for good observation, even if some of the sketches of characters can feel a bit banal at times: telegraphing personality by what one wears, the erudite and eccentric anthropologist parents of Kate, the workaholic verbally abusive father, the housewife growing increasingly delusional and drugged out, the charming commitment proof French Lothario who ensnared and rejected Kate and then begins things with Vicki. Her writing style is just fine, good for her observations, but doesn't necessarily excel at capturing and showing mood or emotion. It also switches from first to third person, and from straight narrative to occasionally epistolary with emails between characters, and I don't feel these style changes added much to the overall, even if the emails could occasionally be funny.There's some snark and moments of humor (but nothing I laughed out loud at) and interesting ideas, but the whole reads somewhat flat to me. These aren't characters or situations that were made to be interesting (because anything can be interesting and well written). And even as a New Yorker who did attend private school at various points of my childhood, none of the observations or characters were new or surprising to me. I could see fans of Prep or The Admissions being interested in this title, and again, it's a very easy read. But I found it just ok and ultimately unmemorable....more",Notes are private!,0,50,1,"Nov 28, 2016",Dec 2016,"Nov 14, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29430752-small-admissions

There's a wealth of facts and information about life in Ancient Greece, from culture and literature to warfare and tactics. It's easy to read and very informative for relative beginners or newcomers to knowledge of Ancient Greece (or in my case refreshers), but for me, what sets apart four and five star nonfiction from three star nonfiction is the writing itself. In this case, Everitt's style was again very easy to process and pick up new facts, but it could be a bit dry, not always engaging, could get hung up on pieces of minutia that could bog down the narrative flow, and ultimately felt more like nicely presented facts with the larger story of Athens in the background, rather than letting the narrative history take center stage. I did like how Everitt would weave in the rituals of belief and the strategic use of the gods by prominent Greeks throughout.

But Idaho, her debut novel, did not work quite as well for me as it did for some of my Goodreads and real life friends, which was a bit disappointing for me as I went in expecting to love it. The way she constructs a sentence and brings a thought or description to the page is first rate, and there's so much about this book I admired in terms of writing craft, but there was also a lot that frustrated me in terms of the multiple narrators and perspectives, the hopping around in time that was highly meaningful for characters losing or lost to time like Wayne (dementia) and Jenny (incarceration) but didn't work for all equally, and the decision to root everything in an unspeakable crime that is still somewhat unresolved in terms of culpability and outcome, but then despite putting together some compelling pieces never fully resolve it. And I'm all for a slow, meditative read where the writing itself takes center stage - some of my most recent favorite reads could be classified that way for sure - but here the pacing is both measured and erratic as we're thrown into new perspectives and timelines, and there's too much left dangling or incomplete or hard to comprehend in the development of the narrative itself. I'm usually a reader where the strength of the writing can pull past some weaknesses of construction or execution, but I ended the read thinking it was beautiful, but feeling a bit let down and not fully connecting to any of the characters or ideas, just the prose itself. Ultimately, I'll be looking forward to the next novel from Emily Ruskovich and see where her talent takes her, and I'd recommend Idaho on the strength of its writing alone to others, but with the caveat that I did find some things problematic and irritating for me with this read.

Though a thin slip of a novel, Exit West packs a powerful punch cloaked subtlFor when we migrate, we murder from our lives those we leave behind. Though a thin slip of a novel, Exit West packs a powerful punch cloaked subtly in a quiet but dynamic tale of migration, told in exquisite yet plain language that is thought provoking and soothing and enraging and just plain beautiful. Nadia and Saeed of a unnamed nation are the focal points, and we follow their journey through young love in a country on the precipice of civil war, to unsteady allies as unwanted refugees in lands reasserting their nativeness and excluding the foreign and alien, to adults grappling with their changing selves and connections to each other and their home while building a new, uncertain future. But Mohsin Hamid makes this story so universal, drawing in smaller and larger patterns of human migration, of love and loss, and the ephemeral nature of humanity that makes one life and all life so precious and so precarious. I would give this 4.5 stars, rounded up to 5 stars for the depth of feeling and intelligence and beauty in the writing.For one moment, we are pottering about our errands as usual and the next we are dying, and our eternally impending ending does not put a stop to our transient beginnings and middles until the instant that it does. Hamid presents the constant churn of connection versus alienation, of new possibilities versus bittersweet nostalgia, of the cages we build for ourselves that we yearn to transcend versus the freedom we long for but also fear, of the comfort and joy of love versus how that love turns to loss and heartbreak: these all apply to our particular lives, and Nadia and Saeed’s tale for certain, but also to the essence of what it means to be human. We are all migrants through time is the quote most often cited by previous ers, and as the universality builds, I better understood why that jumps out so readily. He shows us a variety of characters, in Nadia and Saeed’s tale and in the small anecdotes of individuals spread across the world, then illustrates the common threads uniting them (and us) all, and I loved this way of showing sameness by route of difference. His description of Saeed praying is very illustrative of his overall skill:  When he prayed he touched his parents, who could not otherwise be touched, and he touched a feeling that we are all children who lose our parents, all of us, every man and woman and boy and girl, and we too will be lost by those who come after us and love us, and this loss unites humanity, unites every human being, the temporary nature of our being-ness, and our shared sorrow, the heartache we each carry and yet too often refuse to acknowledge in one another, and out of this Saeed felt it might be possible in the face of death, to believe in humanity’s potential for building a better world… Hamid does allow his characters to become as important as his larger ideas and themes, and I followed with trepidation the acquaintance, affection, alienation and estrangement of Nadia and Saeed as they encounter sectarian war, death, hunger, fear, refugee camps, the anger and kindness of strangers on their journey of migration. Hamid has a light touch of magical realism, as his characters escape via doors from one location to another, not letting their journeys in each location be compromised by too many details of the journeys between each location. Hamid is good at showing connection, a hint of a spark, how love begins in the early meetings between Saeed and Nadia, but he is even better at channeling the complicated feelings of a love grown stale and not nurtured as best it could be, a love being buffeted about by circumstance, and how humans fall out of love with each other as well, and simultaneously hold onto their connections and are dissatisfied with them out of “…the fear of severing their tie, the end of the world they had built together, a world of shared experiences in which no one else would share, and a shared intimate language that was unique to them, and a sense that what they might break was special and likely irreplaceable.” I won’t speak too much more on the plot details and where Nadia and Saeed end up physically or romantically, but most of the world’s greatest love stories, whether ending for good or ill, together or apart, involve adversity and strife and trials of the highest order, and Nadia and Saeed’s certainly fits that criteria, even if their union doesn’t immediately vault to say Romeo and Juliet immortality. But Hamid makes the love story as compelling as the larger ideas about humanity, which of course is also the point: in our own little lives, we may feel as though we love someone greater than any person has ever loved someone, and when our hearts are broken, we feel devastation and despair so great that no one else could have ever had their heart broken so badly before. But the human experience is a shared experience, and we can (and should, and probably don’t do enough) empathize with each other and rebuild ourselves and our world on the backs of that shared empathy.  …the apocalypse appeared to have arrived and yet it was not apocalyptic, which is to say that while the changes were jarring they were not the end, and life went on, and people found things to do and ways to be and people to be with, and plausible desirable futures began to emerge, unimaginable previously, but not unimaginable now, and the result was something not unlike relief. This novel is incredibly timely in the wake of Brexit, the Trump election, the horrors of the war in Syria, the plight of refugees in Europe and the deepening of the various fault lines between people, whether by religion or color or orientation. But it’s also timeless, looking at the vast history and fabric of human experience, and ultimately in Exit West and in human life, hope springs eternal, time moves inexorably forward, all things must end and what comes after always can be better than what came before. And in addition to those universal themes, the particular tale of Nadia and Saeed is both a great framework to explore these complex, intertwined ideas, and a beautiful yet bittersweet story of love and loss between two individuals. I was incredibly moved by this read, which I devoured over the course of a few hours, and throughout I found myself constantly marking pages, writing down specific lines and passages, and feeling overcome with emotion. Very much recommend for lovers of literary fiction, who like a quiet but powerful story, and like to be able to step outside of one’s usual box at the same time as being reminded of our greater commonalities than differences as a human race.-received an ARC via edelweiss, thanks to Riverhead Books and Penguin Random House....more",Notes are private!,0,119,1,"Dec 28, 2016","Dec 28, 2016","Nov 08, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30688435-exit-west

They say we be Christians and suchlike but we ain't. They say we are creatures raised by God above the animals but any man that has lived knows that's damned lies. Days Without End is extremely well-written historical fiction that overall left me admiring the prose and language far more than enjoying the somewhat improbable circumstances and unfolding events of the novel. This was my first time reading Sebastian Barry, and his talent to turn a phrase and paint with words vivid descriptions all in the voice of a singular character is incredible. I felt a bit removed though from the proceedings: even though I believed the emotions and ideas described, I myself was not invested in the outcome, mainly because the ending felt inevitable and a bit predictable (if not also sentimental and satisfying). But I thoroughly loved the writing: the descriptions, dialogue, and reflections on war and brutality and suffering and friendship were so grounded in reality and yet elevated to almost poetry in terms of the beauty. I'd probably give this 3.5 stars, but rounded up to 4 for its overall literary excellence, even if I wasn't emotionally connected or drawn into the characters and events to the same extent as I was hooked on the craft. I may continue to flesh out this  as I let this full story digest with me, but for now, I would recommend this to readers of literary and historical fiction with interest in the American West and Civil War, who embrace a somewhat slow tale in which the writing holds more attention than the events.-received ARC on edelweiss thanks to Viking and Penguin Random House...more",Notes are private!,0,112,1,"Dec 28, 2016","Jan 11, 2017","Nov 08, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30212107-days-without-end

I do not gravitate towards graphic novels as a formA heartfelt, engaging, comprehensive illustrated memoir, The Best We Could Do really blew me away. I do not gravitate towards graphic novels as a format, but this book completely hooked me from the opening panels as Thi Bui embarks on her own journey of motherhood for the first time, and seeks to close the gap between herself and her parents by better understanding where she comes from and their own stories. She does incredible amounts of research and is able to distill years of history and emotion and anecdote into small illustrated panels, each one complex and powerful and detailed but also able to push the story along into the next image and idea. We embark on this journey through the Bui family history, starting with her parents' vastly different backgrounds and lives in Vietnam pre war, during the long destructive war pitting individuals and villages against each other as well as horrific losses from French and American involvement, and life as refugees in Malaysia and in the United States and how everyone truly did the best they could do to forge new lives, avoid hunger, and raise a family against difficult odds. The renderings and text flow remarkably together: from Thi's narration and illustration, one gets the sense that they could not be separated in order for the larger Bui tale to be told for her, and so the format is necessary and revelatory. The drawings themselves are both simple and yet complicated, and have their own hurried urgency that helps establish the flow of the narrative. This is truly a memoir that meditates on what it means to belong - to people, to a place - and raises great questions about who all of us are as children of our parents, how our views of our parents as people evolve, and how roles shift once again if we perpetuate the cycle and have children of our own. Tie in its timeliness and relevance to a larger, social and political discussion of immigrants and refugees, a parallel to the horrors many from Syria, Somalia and other nations with intra and international conflict are facing today and the often strident response by those who would not wish to help or see those war torn people settled into their societies, and you have the makings of a major force in memoir today. Bui's memoir is at once intensely personal, but with huge potential for universal application and empathy.

In the span of a week, I was completely captured by Red Rising, then picked up Golden Son which I also liked though not as much as the first book, but had a whopper of a cliffhanger that meant Morning Star could not wait. I thought Morning Star was the best paced of all three reads, which is saying a lot considering we finally get to the war and rebellion that Darrow's life has building towards the whole time, so Brown does a heck of a job juggling an expanded story line and cast of characters and locations all the while moving the plot forward at breakneck speed and shocking and thrilling the reader along the way.Morning Star is filled with everything you'd want in a final volume of an operatic adventure series: pain, fear, uncertainty, continued struggle, disparate groups and forces coming together, redemption, revenge, justice, love, and ultimately hope. The worldbuilding continues to be strong - I particularly loved the visit to the Rim and to Asgard and the Obsidian lands in the poles - and the battles scenes epic and easy to follow.The characterization is excellent in Morning Star: characters you love and love to hate fill out their arcs and shapes tremendously well. Darrow's character has come a long way since Red Rising, facing his mortality in the worst possible circumstances, and his recovery and rebirth in a sense finally equip him to be the transcendent leader of all Colors he needed to become, while still remaining a flawed person, but one with more mastery over his impulses that previously led him and his allies to death and destruction. My favorite character in the series is probably Sevro, for his combination of tenderness, brutality, off the wall insanity and humor, and true loyalty and love. As great a supporting force in Red Rising and Golden Son as he is, Sevro and Sevro and Darrow's friendship take a central focus in Morning Star. We watch Sevro grapple with leadership, watch him conquer his own impulses for vengeance, and really evolve as a man. (view spoiler)[ When Sevro is apparently killed, I actually nearly cried and might have been devastated to the point of not enjoying the conclusion of Morning Star; Brown's fakeout, while not executed as neatly as it could have been, was most welcome for this reader!  (hide spoiler)] Ragnar's wisdom, grace and strength seem to radiate off the page and Victra's somewhat limited cruelty/snark opens to show a more vulnerable, honorable woman. Most everyone on the periphery gets some solid page time and characterization as well: Dancer, the Howlers, Darrow's Red family, and I particularly loved the moments with Kavax and Sophocles the fox: so cute!Meanwhile we get nice some character making and satisfying moments with Darrow's enemies as well. (view spoiler)[ Cassius' redemption is a nice moment, although in some ways I wish that redemption could have come for Roque instead. Perhaps Roque's betrayal of Darrow in Golden Son is more egregious and more stab in the gut than Cassius' numerous betrayals in both Red Rising and Golden Son, but Roque was one of my favorite characters in the first book, and though he gets a good death in Morning Star I wish there had been more for him. Cassius was always set up as one of the main foils to Darrow (the other being the Jackal), so I see why his redemption and send off was important to Brown, but I did find Cassius somewhat lacking as a fully fleshed out character. The Jackal, what a crazy, disturbed piece of work, nothing we didn't know from Red Rising or Golden Son but enlarged and amplified in the finale. Although the final feeling we do have for him is a sort of a disgusted pity, and the scene where Mustang pulls his feet at his hanging, when no one else would, to remind him he was once loved in his final moments of life was brief but so powerful and poignant.  (hide spoiler)]I will agree with other ers in finding Mustang somewhat of a problematic character in Morning Star. Through all three books, I've appreciated her smarts, her calculation, her will to survive and ensure the survival of her family, and her loyalty to and love for Darrow. But the endgame for Mustang and the lies she tells in Morning Star complicated my feelings for the character: I genuinely did not see it coming that (view spoiler)[ she would be the new Sovereign of the Society and that she had had Darrow's son in secret  (hide spoiler)] And while there's part of me that appreciates the ending and the somewhat full circle for Darrow in regards to where he began with Eo in Red Rising and where he ends with Mustang, I didn't completely feel like Mustang's lies and manipulations of Darrow were justified once he was freed from the Jackal's captivity. I'm hoping Brown gives us more of Mustang in her new role in Iron Gold and answers some of the real criticisms of the character from this final volume.Overall, Morning Star is a fantastic conclusion to the Red Rising trilogy. I will say this has vaulted into my series to re-read list, especially once Iron Gold gets a release date. For a combination of roaring plot, scheming politics, operatic space battles, and a struggle for freedom, the Red Rising series over-delivers on expectations. Four and a half stars for me for this installment, but rounded up to five for the thrilling finale AND great set up for continuation of a world I've grown to really love and be invested in, and five stars for the trilogy as a whole.Red Rising TrilogyMy  of Red Rising - https://www.goodreads.com//show...My  of Golden Son - https://www.goodreads.com//show......more",Notes are private!,0,5,2,"Jul 20, 2017Nov 12, 2016","Jul 22, 2017Nov 13, 2016","Nov 07, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18966806-morning-star

I suppose I now had high expectations for Golden Son, and while they were mostly met and the writing in many ways was an upgrade from the first book, I didn't begin to really enjoy myself and let it take hold of me until the last third of the novel (probably from Chapter 28 or 29 onwards).I was also hampered by the fact that Darrow's judgment is severely off in Golden Son, which is a good thing for his character development and his indecision and fear and failure drive him further from resembling the Gary Stu he occasionally was (for me anyway) in Red Rising. But it's a bad thing for the plot when multiple times bad things happen and plans go awry because of the same character failing. Darrow has had years to grow and develop, and in many ways he has become a commander and leader of note and worth (his approach with Ragnar confirms that). But his nearly fatal flaw of trusting and mistrusting his friends - and indeed not knowing who his friends really are in some ways - is repeated at least three times in Golden Son, and it felt a bit like a tired device, and that Darrow should have learned from prior mistakes sooner.All that being said, Golden Son is still a well paced adventure and is a really solid second book in a trilogy, revealing major truths about the world and its history and major characters' pasts that drive the current plot or feel like major implications for Morning Star (Fitchner, Eo, The Jackal, Octavia, Nero all get their share of big reveals, some in more heartbreaking and infuriating ways than others). And though for me it took longer to get swept away by the action than Red Rising, that last third is such a force of nature that I really couldn't tear myself away, and I was open and exposed and vulnerable when that cliffhanger to end all cliffhangers happened. The betrayal and destruction was shocking, maybe not quite on the level of the ASoIaF Red Wedding in terms of emotional stab in the heart, but definitely a fevered read of horror and surprise and dread.So even though I'm in the middle of two other reads, everything has to pause, as I cannot wait for my 2017 Challenge to read Morning Star: that cliffhanger was too much, and answers and resolution must be found.Overall, I can see why many might prefer Golden Son to Red Rising: it better develops the characters and plot from the first book, and Brown's writing overall has improved. But for me, I really liked Golden Son as a middle installment and am springboarding immediately into the last book, but aside from the wallop of a conclusion it didn't capture my excitement the same way the first book did, and Darrow's Achilles heel (and indeed this correlation is overt as Achilles is referenced several times) is used too often for my taste as a major plot shaper.

Ditto for dystopia-I picked up this title mostly because I randomly picked to read Morning Star for a 2017 reading challenge based on someone's raves, and so I'd have to read Book 1 to see if Book 3 would even be for me- I read Red Rising in a day, and since I could not wait for the commute, in the afternoon I closed my office door to read the final 80 pages of the conclusionThat's how totally hooked I was on this story. I went in wanting something entertaining and new, but I was surprised at how quickly and how much I became glued to the book, both savoring the details and mysteries revealed and desperately trying to turn the page and learn what happens next. So in terms of pure enjoyment and entertainment, Red Rising was a solid 10/10 and a rocket of a first installment of a trilogy. It's been said that the influence mashup is A Game of Thrones meets The Hunger Games and Lord of the Flies but set on the dystopian Mars of the future. (Ender's Game gets mentioned but I haven't read that). I see all of them in the book's DNA, plus your usual array of hero's journey plot points and some archetypes, but Pierce Brown I think does a fantastic job of synthesizing his influences and ideas to bring Darrow's world to life. And unlike other genre novels where the pastiche and influences are tugging at the seams to the detriment of the narrative (thinking of say Eragon and City of Bones in fantasy), Brown is pretty adept at giving readers who loved elements of HG and ASoIaF familiar beats/ideas with enough solid world building and new goals/motivations/ideas.The first third of the book is set in Darrow's home, beneath the surface of Mars: this is where a lot of the info dump and early world building begins. I will say this part is interesting but slower to get through; once the turning point hits and Darrow's home life is tragically interrupted and then the blinders taken off, the plot speeds up as Darrow becomes a Gold, and then really takes off in command school. I liked the early third but did read it a bit slower to get the language, the concepts, the characters, and Brown is much better later on at giving us the info and background of his world while moving the plot forward. At command school especially, the swirling drama and nastiness and political intrigue is very well done and totally drew me in emotionally, and the political and physical warfare left me on the edge of my seat.Rather than dive into more plot bits, I will speak to some of more negative s of this title and my impressions. One common refrain in negative s is that Darrow is a Gary Stu, perfect, bland, cartoon-y, and hard to root for. I personally did not find Darrow to be a Gary Stu in the strictest sense. Is he extremely talented in certain areas like dexterity? Sure, but much of that comes from years developing his Helldiver skills that transfer well to new Gold activities and pursuits. Is he good looking? As a Red he thinks well of his looks but not overly so, but as a Gold he is very handsome, though pales in comparison to many other Golds he encounters and sees. Is he perfect? Not in the least. He constantly questions himself, his commitment to his mission, his abandonment of his Red character to truly become a Gold, and he fears his own rage and rashness. He makes plenty of mistakes, and various people are imperiled or killed because of his decisions and his actions. It takes him awhile at command school to become the kind of leader he wants and needs to be, and he messes up and suffers pretty serious setbacks and losses before getting there. I liked Darrow, even if he didn't immediately vault to my most favorite heroes of all time list. But this is only Book 1, and it was a good start for me with the character.The other thing some negative s focus on is why aren't more Reds enhanced and transformed by Carvers, or Gold adopting the same techniques used on Darrow to improve themselves? The answer to the first question I believe is seen in Mickey and Titus. Mickey himself states how difficult it is for a Carver to match the Gold hand symbols to the body of a former Red, that many attempt it and death is often the result. It's a really risky procedure, and the Carver performing the changes needs to be incredibly skilled and probably lucky as well. (view spoiler)[ Titus gives us the other answer: he reveals himself to also be a transformed Red, but though he's physically altered to be a true Gold, he is either not fully educated on how Gold society and members work or his personality and emotions drive him too far into vengeance, or both. Ultimately he fails to hide his Red nature and Darrow arranges his death to protect himself from exposure as well.  (hide spoiler)] So not only do you need an excellent Carver and luck on your side, the right Red needs to undergo the transformation to do anything more than perhaps murder some Golds. The Gold enhancement question is a good one: we know that Fitchner for example takes metabolizers but coldly rejects Darrow's suggestion that he visit a Carver to remove his paunch and enhance his Gold appearance to look like others. So perhaps it is a form of Gold pride, and acceptance in the Gold pecking order of hierarchical families that discourage Carver enhancement? Hopefully we get more on this in future books. From my first go round, the writing is probably why I initially gave the book 4 stars instead of 5 (it's a rounded down 4.5 star ). I think Brown is a very solid writer, but I did find some bits a bit overwritten and some of the dialogue leaning a bit too far into the realm of cliche, but overall the prose works for the story Brown is trying to tell. If the plot and emotion and pacing and characters hadn't clicked so well for me, perhaps the writing might have detracted a bit more, but I had too much of a bloodydamn good time to get too hung up on the prose. But after a night passed and I was reading something else but still thinking about Red Rising and recommending it to people enthusiastically who I knew were into sci-fi/fantasy like reads, I realized I really loved this book even with my ""meh"" feeling about some of the writing itself, so I edited to round up my 4.5 stars to 5... my reaction really warrants that rating.Ultimately I really enjoyed and definitely recommend Red Rising. I may pick up some other things first, but I am looking forward to reading Golden Son soon, and I may not be able to wait for my 2017 challenge to finish the trilogy with Morning Star!Red Rising Trilogy:My  of Golden Son - https://www.goodreads.com//show...My  of Morning Star - https://www.goodreads.com//show......more",Notes are private!,0,31,2,"Jul 18, 2017Nov 09, 2016","Jul 19, 2017Nov 10, 2016","Nov 07, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/20766595-red-rising

But this read for me was one where some of the parts are better than the sum of the parts, and while I intellectually liked the top macro layer (old gods versus new gods, how we as humans define ourselves and our reality and what takes us away from that realization and awareness) and I enjoyed some of the micro layers (a lot of the little anecdotes in between the narrative chapters were intriguing and charming and fresh), the main story for me lacked action, urgency, and emotional depth. It's a solid 3 star rating from me: I liked it and am happy to have finally read a Neil Gaiman book, but it was somewhat underwhelming and less cohesive than I might have liked. I preferred many of the side stories and ancillary characters to the focal points of the main narrative, whose personalities ranged from benignly boring (Shadow) to irritatingly enigmatic (Mr. Wednesday). Perhaps, even if I like my protagonists in shades of gray as well as black and white, I prefer great writing, interesting ideas AND action, and here though the ideas came fast and furious, not enough of them coalesced into real action and plot development for my taste. It's a book that's hard to pin down: road trip, heroic epic, little short stories, a general philosophizing about the merits and demerits about the myth of America and the American way. Its meandering nature means that one can easily get lost in the bombardment of content, which can be quite fun, but some of these brief trips into other tales were more tantalizing than the main yarn. It's not uninteresting, but I was occasionally wearied by yet another motel scene, yet another bizarre interaction with a New God, yet another person remarking on Shadow's size. And though the storytelling and structure didn't hint at a climactic conclusion, the way the plot unfolded and hinted at a war between the gods, I did expect a greater, larger showdown in the book's final act, and was mildly let down by what and how it came to pass. But there's also so much I did enjoy: Mr. Ibis and Jacquel's funeral parlor and the weighing of souls, the tale of Agasu and Wututu, Mr. Nancy, the tale of Essie Tregowan, the town of Lakeside and its unspoken deal with ""the devil"" to ensure peace and prosperity. And there are great ideas I was intellectually thrilled by, like:Fiction allows us to slide into these other heads, these other places, and look out through other eyes. And then in the tale we stop before we die, or we die vicariously and unharmed, and in the world beyond the tale we turn the page or close the book, and we resume our lives.A life, which is, like any other, unlike any other.and  ""This is the only country in the world,"" said Wednesday, into the stillness, ""that worries about what it is.""""What?""""The rest of them know what they are. No one ever needs to go searching for the heart of Norway. Or looks for the soul of Mozambique. They know what they are.""andPeople believe, thought Shadow. It's what people do. They believe. And then they will not take responsibility for their beliefs; they conjure things, and do not trust the conjurations. People populate the darkness; with ghosts, with gods, with electrons, with tales. People imagine, and people believe: and it is that belief, that rock-solid belief, that makes things happen.Overall, this is a fascinatingly constructed group of tales and has a wealth of ideas and anecdotes that made for a solid reading experience. But the main plot and characters were not quite as strong to sustain my engaged interest throughout, and I ultimately admired more than enjoyed this. experience.

How better and more hinged on their ideas of success, their plans. Mama, Chinese, the Bronx, Deming: they had never been enough. He shivered, and for a brief, horrible moment, he could see himself the way he realized they saw him - as someone who needed to be saved. Lisa Ko's The Leavers is such a raw, honest read, a novel of alienation and identity, adoption and duality and what it means to be family, that is well-written with frequent notes of humor and fun, all the while treating its characters with respect while showcasing their flaws and mistakes, their struggles and redemption. The prose is intelligent, the narrative flowing, and the main characters very compelling, coalescing into an easy, enjoyable yet enlightening and thought-provoking read. I'd give it 3.5 stars and round up to 4 stars: it's definitely not perfect and sometimes feels like a first novel with some pacing and structural incongruities, but the intelligence and interesting topics, plus the overall quality of the prose won me over and I'll be looking forward to Ko's future novels as well.Our main character is Deming Guo / Daniel Wilkinson, though not far behind in importance is is mother, Peilan / Polly. We see flashes of both parts of Deming/Daniel's personality and past. As Deming, a young boy living in the Bronx with his mother, clearly struggling a bit to make ends meet on an undocumented nail technician's salary, but it's his life and he's grown to love it, with his beloved mother, her fun and caring boyfriend Leon, Leon's sister Vivian and her son Michael. And all of it comes undone the day Polly doesn't return from work, and for Deming, there's no trace of where she went or what happened to her. We're taken through his journey as he becomes Daniel, abandoned by the people who professed to love him and adopted at age eleven by a family with no children of their own, a family who believes they are prepared to love him and imprint their version of the American way upon him. And he's able to acquiesce to these well-meant wishes and desires, and submit to being Daniel Wilkinson for a time. But we all have to grow up sometime, and for Daniel, that means painful and poignant realizations and truths about himself and his adoptive family and his past. After ten years he had stopped noticing how different they looked from him, but he hadn't seen them in two months, had been working and riding the subway and walking the streets with all kinds of people, and now they were the ones who seemed different - quieter, diminished, out of touch. This role reversal was unexpectedly fulfilling. Deming / Daniel wrestles with who he is and who he should be through his childhood, adolescence, right up into the present of the novel as somewhat flailing, unconnected adult, who feels entirely alienated from the world around him, whether upstate at home with his adoptive parents increasingly disappointed in his choices and his divergence from their upbringing and values, or playing in a band and trying to socialize with his one friend from high school. He's creatively and personally stuck in neutral. If only he had the right clothes, knew the right references, he would finally become the person he was meant to be... but no matter how many albums he acquired or playlists he artfully compiled, the real him remained stubbornly out there like a fat cruise ship on the horizon, visible but out of reach, and whenever he got closer it drifted farther away. He was forever waiting to get past the secret entrance, and when the ropes did part he could never fully believe he was in. Another door materialized, another rope to get past, always the promise of something better. These are common sentiments for those approaching and just entering adulthood, in fiction and real life, but they take extra importance for Daniel, whose past as Deming he had seemingly erased to fit into his new life, and only now does the confusion and anger and despair fully set in, as he suspects he can't be or become who he is or should be, not without processing and understanding his mother's disappearance and his abandonment by her and those he called family, and reconciling all parts of his past and personality. And while I didn't always like Daniel/Deming as a character - he could irritate and frustrate me sometimes with his self-pitying behavior - I understood and empathized with him, and wanted to see where he'd end up and if he could escape his pain and confusion and become a full adult person.If it were only from Daniel's perspective, Ko still would have written a great novel, but we also are treated to Polly / Peilan's viewpoint in first person, powerful and emotional and very relevant in today's endless political discussions about undocumented immigrants. Ko waits to provide Polly's perspective as Daniel / Deming starts to retrace her steps and put the pieces together about what happened to her (no spoilers from me), but hearing Deming's past in her voice, understanding her sharp intellect and fierce determination for a better life for her son and herself, getting a clearer glimpse of her own origins in China, and the anguish of how and why she left Deming behind creates a compelling character portrait, one I found I could empathize with as much as I did with Daniel / Deming. In short, The Leavers wears many hats at once: a coming of age story, an immigrant story, a story of reconciling diverging parts of one's past and personality, a family epic. It worked for me because of the observant, insightful description and dialogue and flowing narrative of Lisa Ko, even if there were some structural or plot decisions that I felt could have been stronger or tightened up a bit. Four stars for me, strong recommend for lovers of contemporary fiction, family and immigrant stories, and coming of age / coming into one's own tales....more",Notes are private!,0,44,1,"Dec 06, 2016","Dec 08, 2016","Nov 05, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30753987-the-leavers

It was a very quick read for me (a night I have mixed thoughts about Heartless, so I'm going to ultimately give it 3 stars (probably 3.5 in reality). It was a very quick read for me (a night and early morning), and some pieces of the retelling were done very well and I loved parts of the expanded world Meyer created (especially all things original or retold from Chess), but though it was enjoyable, it didn't grab me emotionally or intellectually and I felt the adventure plot line more interesting and impactful than the relationship/royalty/baking plot line, so for me it was just a solid retelling/prequel of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland & Through the Looking-Glass focused on the life and times of the Queen of Hearts pre-Alice.Cath as our protagonist and the future Queen of Hearts begins the novel as a smart, quick young woman but one who is too afraid of her mother to assert herself for what she truly wants (freedom, and to open a bakery with her dear friend and maid Mary Ann). So she's a bit spineless, which in some ways made it harder for me to emotionally connect with her, despite being irritated for the lack of opportunity for women in the society of Hearts (that mirrors the restraints of Carroll's Victorian times as well). Cath became far more interesting to me as she reaches the tipping point of turning into the Queen of Hearts: her quickness to cruelty, her impatience for the whimsical nonsense and deliberate ignorance of Hearts to disgust and loathing, and her spinelessness to strength.In some ways we know where Cath needs to get to become the Queen of Hearts who is so prominent in the source material, and maybe Meyer is a bit restricted herself in playing around with ideas and characters to get us there. The dark, handsome love interest foil for Cath in opposition of the King of Hearts is a great original character, but again, since we already know how it ends, Jest and Cath's relationship I enjoyed reading but never found myself rooting for it or connecting emotionally to it. And much of the scenes at court or balls or with Cath's parents or with the future Duchess and her suitor or with Mary Ann dreaming about the bakery, again I liked reading but just didn't grab me on other levels.The parts I did read with enthusiasm were fewer but made the novel stand out: the fully fleshed out tea party (only somewhat mad, versus the completely mad tea party Alice attends), the use of the classic ""Peter, Peter, pumpkin eater"" rhyme and the very unpleasant, sinister Peter Peter and his creepy shrinking wife Lady Peter, the battles against the Jabberwock, the final courtroom scenes at the end when Cath becomes the woman she is meant to be. I suppose when it gets more dark fairytale-esque and adventure story and we deal with more unpleasant characters and ideas, I was more interested (and what does that say about me?)I won't spoil the plot details, but I will say my main issue with the novel is that for me Meyer has such fantastic bits that she reveals, but because they don't serve the larger plot they are presented rather tantalizingly as needed, but then pulled away. But if Meyer ever wrote a follow up or companion centered around the war in Chess and the adventures of Jest, Hatta, and Raven in the service of the White Queen, I would probably read that feverishly, as I was very fascinated by her interpretation of Hatta and the creation of Jest and Raven, and could see that narrative as a darker, more adventurous and free tale, still nodding to the source material but fully imagined on its own. I'd probably also read a Queen of Hearts sequel, with Alice's visit from her perspective and her own adventures in her new character (maybe a visit to Alice's home in England?). So clearly I liked the world that Meyer built, even if Heartless for me did not tug at my heart or head itself. But the potential is there for me to be moved, so I'll hope Meyer returns to the world of Hearts and more importantly, the world of Chess! ...more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Nov 09, 2016","Nov 11, 2016","Nov 03, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18584855-heartless

An enthusiastic, passionate one for the most part, and trying to be a better one every day. There are lots of books I completely fall inI'm a reader. An enthusiastic, passionate one for the most part, and trying to be a better one every day. There are lots of books I completely fall in love with and champion, saying how great a read it was. But every now and again, there's a book that so grabs me and speaks to me and says things that I feel may have sprung from my own brain, Athena style, and is so original and fun and heart-wrenching that not only do I love reading it, I wish I had written it. On some level, I feel like I wrote it, it's my baby, that's how connected I am to the characters, the narrative, the plot, the feel.I wish I had written The Animators. (Apparently, so does Emma Donoghue, now that I've seen her blurb). I loved reading The Animators. And I'm so damn happy that Kayla Rae Whitaker let this wonderfully written story of creativity and friendship and love and grief and memory, of belonging and the family we choose and the family we're born with, of how we wrestle with our own stories and our places in the life stories of others, of all the intricacies and messiness and unexpected beauty and unpleasantness of life, spring forth from her head and wrestle and shape it into the glorious novel that is The Animators.'I spent years of my life trying to outrun myself,' Mel says. 'Trying to make enough noise to drown myself out. It makes me ashamed to admit this. But it's okay to let yourself catch up. It's okay if you work to catch up to the things that have happened to you. You do it for yourself. But also for the people around you. The people who deserve to experience you, undiluted, honest. Your genuine self, given to them... Your life is the people who fill it, and nothing's good without them.'The two things that make this book what it is are the characters, and the writing. Characters first. Sharon Kisses is our protagonist, and it's her head, first person perspective that we are immersed in throughout. There's no Sharon without Mel Vaught, her cartoonist partner that she first meets in Introduction to Sketch at Ballister, the college they're both attending in upstate New York. Both women have a passionate fire (Mel's bold and brash and raw, Sharon's a bit more secret and tempered by fear of failure and not being good enough), and both see Ballister and more importantly, art/drawing as a physical and emotional escape from their pasts and the worst parts of themselves. Kentucky and Florida lay in their rear-views, and their chance meet and then fall into friendship and mutual appreciation and excitement for each other's talent leads us quickly from Ballister to Brooklyn ten years later, successfully launching their first film, ""Nashville Combat"" which was mined and created from Mel's swampland-set childhood with her delinquent, criminal mother Kelly Kay. But just as they are primed for success, Mel is spiraling out of control with drugs and alcohol, while Sharon's insecurities and self-loathing are ratcheting up to new highs. But then tragedy strikes, and strikes again, and again, and Mel and Sharon are drawn back together, protecting and helping the other on an odyssey that takes both of them back to where they've come from and propels them forward to new creative and friendship highs and lows.Mel and Sharon are both incredibly realized characters, dynamic yet damaged. And their friendship and work partnership is a beautiful thing: they bring out the best in each other while simultaneously forcing and helping confront and conquer the worst in each other, and feeding and nourishing their individual and collective creative processes. We get the early sketches of both in broad strokes, but Whitaker has an incredible way of revealing the depths of both characters. Mel is magnetic, stealing the scenes she's in whether as brave, compulsive Mel or caring, quieter, introspective Mel. She's a force of nature, and you can't help but be charmed by her almost immediately, just as Sharon was. Sharon, meanwhile, gains your interest and emotion through the read: though when we start with adult Sharon she's concerned about her relative unimportance and lack of talent in comparison to Mel and feeling listless and unsatisfied (and we as the reader aren't yet that connected with her), Sharon's character grows rapidly throughout, and my love for her swelled accordingly. We're with Sharon and in her head through all of her suffering and her joys, and as she reveals her own humor, intelligence and anguish and starts to discover the gnawing creative spark all her own, we fully embrace Sharon as much as Mel. And their relationship is complicated, need and desire and resentment and fear and loneliness wrapped throughout their interactions, but their love for each other and their incredible ability to collaborate creatively, to understand each other's spark and force it into being, into work is rendered so well by Whitaker. A project always begins like a pimple on the back of the neck. You can't see it, but you can feel it, rising just under the surface. And it drives you crazy. It swells, gains definition, becomes visible. The bigger it gets, the more it presses into the back of your spine. The more it presses, the less you can focus on anything else. Working on it every day is just a way of scratching the itch until you've finished its business and it slowly starts to shrink back down. Whitaker's secondary and tertiary characters - their agent Donnie, Sharon's mother and sister Shauna, Caroline, Teddy, Brecky - are also all so well done, and I'd say especially Sharon's mother and sister, who transcend the stereotypical Appalachian ""white trash"" boxes Sharon sometimes tries to push them into (and a lesser writer than Whitaker might have done) and are scene-stealers all their own with depth and nuance.I really won't get more into the plot: the friendship and complex love and shared but separate creative brains of Mel and Sharon drive it, but it's too hard to not spoil if I start talking in more detail. Suffice it to say the emotional highs and lows I took reading this, the genuine shock and sadness I felt, speak to my involvement in where this story went. And though I was taken aback and almost angry to continue after a final tragedy, the aftermath was entirely appropriate, well handled, and so authentic I felt the same eventual catharsis as the characters.And the writing. Oh, it zips, zigs, zags, it's smart and funny and always managed to crack me right in the gut and knock the wind out of me with its heart and sad bits. Kayla Rae Whitaker's talent is so palpable and so present. The writing is as electric and alive as Mel is, and can be as subdued and questioning as Sharon can be. It jolted me along, top speed, full of sound, snap crackle pop: it's flashy without actually being flashy, just so good and so true to who these characters are that I was bookmarking and highlighting like a fiend, sometimes getting rocketed out of my enjoyment to marvel at a sentence, fully immerse myself in emotion. The closest comps I could think of to compare to in terms of sheer pleasure at how smart/fun/creative the writing is are The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao and Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk. Whitaker's writing is such that makes you remember why you love to read, and because it's in service to memorable, funny, heartbreakingly real characters like Mel and Sharon, and it's got that extra, semi-meta element in which we're talking about the birth of art and the creative process (in the least pretentious way possible) while Whitaker is creating this gem of a tale. Others have said that this is a queer The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay: I don't know that I entirely agree with the overall comp due to their very, very different sensibilities. And I don't think all lovers of one will love the other. But I'm definitely in the intersection of the Venn diagram of these two titles. They share DNA with specific yet universal stories of friendship and love, of creativity, of overcoming and accepting one's past. They are both smart and well-written, and wear their emotions openly and will break your heart for how beautiful and meaningful the characters' ups and downs can be. I responded to both with fist pumping admiration and enthusiasm, my intellectual and emotional sides in harmonious agreement with love for what I was experiencing. And both vaulted into my all time favorites after the first read. I wish I had written The Animators. I loved reading The Animators. And I'm so happy that this book exists and is due to be published in a little over a month, so I can read it again and again and again.-received as ARC on edelweiss thanks to Random House...more",Notes are private!,0,74,1,"Dec 18, 2016","Dec 21, 2016","Nov 01, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30090925-the-animators

Reading A Darker Shade of Magic was eWhile this gets a lot of praise and I can understand why based on its inventiveness, I have a more mixed . Reading A Darker Shade of Magic was easy and entertaining, and V.E. Schwab has tremendous storytelling skills, solid writing, and she has built an imaginative, thrilling world concept that I seemed to just be scratching the surface of in this series opener. I'm happy two more installments already exist (I hate waiting), and yet for some reason, the book itself didn't bowl me over or wow me and in some ways disappointed me. Overall, it was a nice, solid, well-paced and well-executed fantasy, but I can't give it greater praise than ""I liked it"", so I'm settling for 3 stars and hoping I'm more swept away by A Gathering of Shadows and A Conjuring of Light and that Schwab makes good on her promising world-building with deeper characterization and a more original, engaging plot.It's hard for me to pinpoint why exactly the book was entertaining but no more than that for me, but I think it was a combination of feeling a bit removed from the characters plus the ""more paradox"". Characters first. Kell is the main protagonist, an Antari, capable of traveling between the various Londons and skilled in elemental and other magic. He's probably the most fleshed out and most complex character we encounter, with a past shrouded in mystery and a current role as a smuggler but also Master and adoptive royal family member/servant. His dissatisfaction with his unknown origins and his forced place at the side of the royals is not one note though: it drives him to take risks and smuggle things between the Londons, but he also doesn't reject his life outright since it's given him a deep and lasting relationship with his ""brother"" Prince Rhy. While on the surface, I could support Kell's positions contrasted with the nasty, sadistic evil of the Dane twins who rule White London or the cold, bondage-driven brutality of Holland, their servant, I wasn't drawn to root for Kell, nor was I really invested in his personal triumphs or failures. Lila is the other main protagonist, who I was even less sure if I was rooting for her or not. At first glance, Lila is a devil may care, strong, independent, deadly young woman, a lowly pickpocket who'd like nothing more than to be a pirate. But I was hoping for more depth to her beyond badassness and recklessness, and while future installments I hope develop both characters further: they were elusive to me in this book and my failure to connect with them greatly impacted my ability to connect with the story in a larger way.And because my connection to the characters was somewhat compromised, I wanted more of what I loved: the world(s) itself and the nature of Vitari, the magic. Schwab's universe is alluring and vaguely threatening, and I was as enthralled with the richness of Red London as the cold cruelty and desperation of White London, and the cautionary tale and lurking malevolence of Black London. (Grey London, which equates to our Earth's London circa the Regency period I liked less, in part because even though it's set during the regency and mad King George III makes an appearance, the dialogue and setting sometimes feel anachronistic and so the time setting feels random and underdeveloped. And it doesn't help I recently finished Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell that does alternate history fantasy and magic in the Regency period so well and so specifically to that time). I could have used more exposition, more detail, to feel like I was really sinking my teeth into something fantastic and be utterly spellbound. But I was mildly disappointed on that front, so I was turning the pages quickly and discovered how Kell and Lila's quest turned out and a bit more details about the world, but my reading was all very passive as opposed to active. For the majority, I felt like I was watching everything transpire without being truly engaged in it. It didn't help that the overall arc - dangerous MacGuffin found, evil in pursuit, protagonists team up on the run, friends and allies imperiled, showdown to save the world(s) - was not overly inspiring or fresh, even if again Schwab executed it well. The originality of Schwab's worlds seem to hint at or even demand originality in the plot, so here's hoping she dives deeper into the wonderful sandbox she's created in future installments and comes up with an equally inventive narrative and construction.It's somewhat rare for me to be ambivalently positive about a book, and yet also be eager to continue with the next book in the series. But Schwab's A Darker a Shade of Magic gives you just enough glimpses into her imagination and the coming conflicts and more of the Magic system to whet your appetite, though for my taste not giving me quite enough specific details, plot, and characterization for me to love and embrace the narrative and main cast as much as I immediately was hooked by Schwab's ideas and world building. A good but flawed start for me, something I liked but also was lightly let down by, and though eager for more and hoping for future greatness I'm not passionate about what I've read thus far....more",Notes are private!,0,55,2,"Oct 05, 2017Mar 10, 2017","Oct 07, 2017Mar 12, 2017","Nov 01, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/25667118-a-darker-shade-of-magic

Though on the face of things, I wouldn't have thought this was my kind of book, I was pulled in to the twisted clues Ava was following, and the history of emotional manipulation and damage and destruction between Ava, Zelda, and their parents and closest friends. It helps that Caite Dolan-Leach has a writing style that is just a bit overly wordy, but is entirely accessible and approachable, hitting just the right balance for a literary mystery novel. And while at first I more or less disliked all of the characters, Dolan-Leach does a tremendous job drawing sympathy and empathy for each of them, so by the novel's conclusion I was surprised and emotionally involved at the outcome.This is an elevated entertaining novel: with the vineyard backdrop and the obscene amounts of alcohol consumed by the characters, part of this is a fantastic escape into the lives of well-to-do, pretty people coming into harder times and revealing the darkness lurking below the surface. But even more than that, it's a psychological study of characters, slowly peeling away at the outer shells surrounding them, and even though Zelda's master plan required some suspension of disbelief, I was completely engrossed by the drama and dysfunction. Overall, Dead Letters is smart writing, a clever conceit, flawed and fascinating characters, and a satisfying mystery with an emotional ending. 4 stars from me: I'd read it again (with a very nice glass of wine in hand), will be interested to see what Caite Dolan-Leach comes out with next, and would recommend it to fans of psychological thrillers and dysfunctional families in the mood for a slightly more moody and literary hybrid of the two categories....more",Notes are private!,0,62,1,"Jan 20, 2017","Jan 26, 2017","Oct 27, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30900136-dead-letters

We are treated to Victoria'sOverall, Victoria: The Queen is very well researched and has a flowing narrative style that makes it easy to engage with. We are treated to Victoria's own life chronologically, from an infant fifth in line to the throne to a passionate teenager thrust into rule, from the swooning love and contentment of her marriage to Albert, to her consuming grief and seclusion after his death, from the Widow of Windsor to her reemergence in politics and foreign policy. Above all, Julia Baird is able to refute the popular notion (one that Victoria herself propagated) that Albert was the true power behind the throne, as even when pregnant and caring for young children, Victoria's strength and fiery personality are ever present and assertive in terms of dealing with foreign policy and thinking of how best to care for her subjects. She also is able to draw a strong hypothesis as to the nature of the relationship between John Brown and the Queen, one that has always elicited interest and controversy even from contemporary Victorian sources. And she does what she can to set the record straight so to speak from the heavily censored version of Victoria's diaries that her daughter Beatrice edited after her mother's death, to present a true, well-rounded portrait of a powerful, feisty woman and ruler, showcasing her strengths and flaws of character to equal effect.Besides being an exhaustive portrait of Victoria herself, Julia Baird also does a wonderful job giving very strong portraits of major figures in British and European history as well, notably Prince Albert, Gladstone and Disraeli and their political battles, and Kaiser Wilhelm II, Victoria's grandson (who comes off distinctly poorly). Baird is also very well able to situate some of the European political crises of the Victorian era, and show the connecting threads from Victoria's family and personal and political decision making to various critical events in the 20th century like World War I, and even some that still reverberate today, like conflicts in Afghanistan and elsewhere in the Middle East. I do wish there was a bit more discussion about the Empire that greatly expanded under her reign, and given a bit more insight into the positive and even more so negative impacts of the British colonial policy and how they did or did not affect Victoria: those parts are definitely minimized, which perhaps speaks to the ministers leaving the Queen in a bit of ignorance about atrocities and famine and hunger in the name of the Empire.The Victorian era of England and Britain is very well captured, and we absorb the fast changing social, industrial, and economic conditions as Victoria, Albert, and the government's reforms and laws are implemented. One really got a well rounded sense of what it meant to be living in the transforming Victorian Britain, from the early days of Victoria's reign to the end at the dawn of the 20th century, and how progress and change in fashion, medicine, and cultural mores occurred. I particularly liked the connective tissue between Victoria- who perpetuated the idea that women should be subservient to their husbands and even she was lesser than Albert though her rule, importance, and assertiveness were undiminished and unchallenged in his lifetime - and the women's suffrage movement, something that she herself was ambivalent about and yet her longevity and dominance and strength came to be embraced and the symbol of Victoria adopted in some ways by early suffragettes. I highly recommend this read for people interested in Queen Victoria and the Victorian era in British politics and British life, and also for most readers of biographies who'd like to see the long life of a dynamic and powerful, emotional and courageous Queen. ...more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,"Nov 20, 2016","Nov 29, 2016","Oct 16, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/24212581-victoria-the-queen

Trevor Noah's childhood memoir definitely showcases his fresh, witty perspective and provide a lot of history and context of life under apartheid and life just after the end of apartheid, from a macro level of the forces and powers at work and warring against each other, to the micro level of Trevor and his family's experiences in that time. I've visited South Africa before and felt I knew a decent amount about the country's culture and history, but Noah really brought to light intricacies of daily life and nuances about how different groups interacted and experienced each other under and after apartheid. Noah's family is mostly seen in brief anecdotes and sketches, but his mother is a central figure and the most compelling character we encounter. Her faith, her hustle, her perseverance, and her sense of humor are palpable in Noah's writing, and we are shown the complex but very loving relationship between Trevor and his mother expand and grow over the years. Because the anecdotes and stories are presented in a non linear fashion, it can be difficult to get a fix on sense of time and when things are happening for Trevor and his mother and brothers. It also chops up the narrative flow, which meant that I was less interested in Trevor's own story since it kept hopping around in the timeline, and more interested in his family story and the larger context about how his race/color was being constantly perceived and redefined by different groups, and also by himself. As a multiracial American, I could relate to many aspects of Trevor's own shifting identity for himself and his peers, but many other aspects were completely foreign and indeed eye opening for me.The casual way Trevor narrates is both a highlight and a fault: it definitely jumps off the page is being securely in his voice, so it has a true feeling of authenticity. But it also has an effect of little editing and a lack of polish, so where other memoirists link events within a larger narrative framework and immerse you in the story AND the writing, here it's more disjointed, less cohesive, so you appreciate some of the parts more than the sum of their parts. And not all of the individual anecdotes feel fully worthy of inclusion. And the ending feels less like a natural ending and more like Noah ran out of steam (though the final story of the attempted murder of his mother is powerful and scary and was probably hard to write).Ultimately if you're a fan of Trevor Noah, or are interested in a unique perspective that unites childhood under and after apartheid with larger historical and social context of South Africa, Born a Crime is a solid choice. It's an easy read, but it took me longer than usual to finish since I was not really engaged with the non linear narrative and the style and format of the writing itself, though the subject matter was interesting....more",Notes are private!,0,187,1,"Oct 17, 2016",Nov 2016,"Oct 16, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29780258-born-a-crime

I'll start off by saying I enjoyed reading this, though my enjoyment felt occasionally like rubbernecking at a five car pile up on the highway and one is a tractor-trailer and it's on fire, and so my enjoyment made me a bit comfortable at times (which is no bad thing, it's great when books push you to recognize your own bias and perspective and question yourself morally). Walls' childhood is littered with anecdotes by turn fascinating and horrifying and humorous, and she achieves a fantastic balance covering what it was like to grow up the child of Rex and Rose Mary Walls in an objective, dispassionate way, but also is able to show how she and (most of) her siblings were able to survive and thrive in spite of (and Walls allows ""because of"" too) her dysfunctional, chaotic upbringing. And though Rex and Rose Mary have some truly abominable, selfish, insane moments between them, there's also love, education, and resilience passed from parent to child and then back the other way, and the sibling bond is protective, fierce, and funny. This is one of the gold standards for family memoir and fucked up childhood memoir for a reason.But as much as her childhood was illuminating and shocking, and I applaud Walls' candor about the levels of her parents misbehavior while also showing the positive qualities they were able to instill in their children, I didn't love this memoir. I suppose I judge nonfiction on a similar level to fiction, but in some ways my inner critic is a bit sharper. For nonfiction to be great for me, the narrative has to be absorbing and the research has to be sound, but I also prefer a distinctive and fluid writing style (not everything has to be lyrical, but I need more than a recitation of facts and events) and I prefer that the sum of the parts not be greater than the whole. Great memoirs for me (thinking of Insomniac City , The Best We Could Do and When Breath Becomes Air for starters) achieve this, so I'm overcome with feeling and appreciation and interest at the conclusion, and I've enjoyed the anecdotes presented, admired the prose, and been able to take away larger meaning, not necessarily for myself but for the broader human experience. I did not feel the same from The Glass Castle, probably from some combination of the removed, dry, journalistic prose (which I understand why she used it to tell her story effectively, but it did limit the emotional connection for me as a reader and could occasionally bore me as a lover of more exciting prose styles whether quiet or sharp or incisive or questioning or contemplative) and the lack of a larger connective thread beyond the very specific tale of overcoming parental obstacles by the Walls children. I guess ultimately for me The Glass Castle didn't transcend what it was at face value: a dysfunctional family history with an out for the author and siblings at the end. And for me to really like or love a memoir, I need more than just interesting anecdotes (though I readily admit I couldn't look away from the page as Walls related moments major and minor, completely insane and completely endearing). I'd probably rate this 3.5 stars and round down to 3 stars. I would recommend it to regular memoir readers if they haven't read this yet: again, I can see how and why this memoir is enduringly popular, and will probably bubble back onto bestsellers lists around the movie adaptation releases. But I didn't find it as special or transcendent as other memoirs I've read and loved recently, and so for me, it's a solid ""I liked it""....more",Notes are private!,0,60,1,"Jan 16, 2017","Jan 22, 2017","Oct 15, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7445.The_Glass_Castle

I didn’t expect my primary reactions while reading to be I picked up The Good Lord Bird as a book on my shelf I’d never gotten around to reading. I didn’t expect my primary reactions while reading to be smirking, snorting, and in some places laughing out loud, while also nodding ferociously at some of the well-observed “truths” McBride’s narrator Onion uncovers over the course of the story. This book is humorous, satirical historical fiction, but I think McBride also hits the absurdity and inhumanity of so much of the American social construct in the 1850s (and today): slavery, violence against black people, colorism, erasure of black voices. And yet by giving his individual characters depth, dimension, motive and personality, McBride’s Onion, Old Man (John Brown), Bob, Brown’s sons, and various other characters are more than just stock figures enacting the scenes to illustrate McBride’s themes. It’s a tightrope, but for me at least, McBride really pulled it off: I was entertained, amused, horrified, enraged, and educated by various turns. I went with 4.5 stars, rounded up to 5 stars: I think right after reading it I probably would have rounded down, but I let this novel sink deeper into my brain and after swirling around the themes and doing a bit more unpacking of the novel, I really marveled at its ability to make me think and feel in addition to finding it enjoyable and well-written.He was like everybody in war. He believed God was on his side. Everybody got God on their side in a war. Problem is, God ain’t tellin’ nobody who He’s for.The book opens in the heart of Bleeding Kansas, when Kansas was a territory not a state and the struggle between abolitionists and pro-slavers over the state’s fate mirrored the larger political, ideological, and violent disagreements across the country. Onion through a series of unfortunate events is mistaken for a girl and then “liberated” from slavery when John Brown/the Old Man accidentally kills Onion’s father. Onion, the Old Man, and his not so merry band of sometimes-abolitionist allies go on a long journey through free and slave territories and states, interacting with a cross section of society – free, famous, important to slaves and poor or working people – until they all wind up at the place of destiny: Harper’s Ferry, Virginia and the doomed raid to seize munitions and free black people. With this seemingly serious and important historical moment and the horrors of slavery as a backdrop, as I said earlier I really was not expecting things to be so damn funny. Onion is such a good unreliable narrator, framed as an adult man reflecting on times long past as a child, and his observations and recollections can be very sharply observed and snarky to downright hilarious. I think I first knew what I was in for in the opening scenes in which Onion first meets John Brown, the Old Man, and is mistaken for a girl based on a mispronounced name (and oh the link to modern day microaggressions and “black names” just made this more funny):See my true name is Henry Shackleford. But the Old Man hear Pa say “Henry ain’t a” and took it to be “Henrietta,” which is how the Old Man’s mind worked. Whatever he believed, he believed. It didn’t matter to him whether it was really true or not. He just changed the truth till it fit him. He was a real white man.To Onion pulling his best Scarlett O’Hara and riffing on the stereotypes of biracial women of the time (see Eliza from Uncle Tom's Cabin) and using his “feminine wiles” to put a nosy rebel pro-slaver off the scent: “I am Henrietta Shackleford and you ought not to talk ‘bout me like I am a full-blooded n-, being that I am only half a n—and all alone in this world. The best part of me nearly as white as you, sir. I just don’t know where I belongs, being a tragic mulatto and all.” Then I busted into tears.To how Onion recollects his interactions with Frederick Douglass, the great man of black and abolitionist history, somewhat reduced to a comic character of predatory lechery and bombast, but with some choice lines:  “Don’t you know you are not addressing a pork chop, but rather a fairly considerable and incorrigible piece of the American Negro Diaspora?”The more stupefied he got, the more he forgot about the hanky-panky he had in mind and instead germinated on what he knowed – orating. First he orated on the plight of the Negro. He just about wore the Negro out.But if all The Good Lord Bird was was a comic romp through pre-Civil War Kansas, Missouri, the North and Virginia with slavery, abolitionists, and Onion’s hiding as a girl played for laughs, the book wouldn’t have been successful. Instead, the comedy lives alongside and gives way for really serious, thoughtful meditations on the creation of the myth of John Brown, the necessity of the Civil War to free the slaves, the complete ignorance and dismissal of black people’s needs, wants, fears in everything, gender norms and their subversion or removal especially among slaves as a means of survival. For example, on the question of gender, Onion is going through this point of life as a girl for an added level of safety and to conform with what the Old Man has assumed about him. It’s telling then that in Onion’s eyes, the people depicted with the most strength, courage are black women: Sibonia and Libby, Harriet Tubman, and Miss Becky. (And note that McBride does give us a character like Pie to show another, more selfish but perhaps necessary from circumstances side of survival for female slaves). When Onion tries to gather his own courage and figure out what it means to be a man, those female examples seem to be the ones he relies on most, as he rephrases some of the ideas of Sibonia and Harriet to push him to act for the good of others and risk his own safety, and stop hiding and concealing who he was. Onion’s coming of age in the novel also reflects the transformation from slave to free person: Onion explains how hiding, covering, lying, tricking are tools of slaves to stay alive and ahead of the white masters, so Onion (view spoiler)[revealing himself as a boy and running back to the raid (hide spoiler)] seem to cement Onion’s status as truly free and fully himself. Onion’s loss of innocence and admission of responsibility for some of the calamitous raid (view spoiler)[ and the death of the Rail Man and loss of potential black allies  (hide spoiler)] to me also reflects the price of freedom. As the narrative unfolds, Onion’s perspective expands to take on more than his own survival and immediate desires of security, and we see greater recognition of the silencing and lack of agency and willpower black people are thought to have by whites and decisions are made about and for Onion and others. Take for example the difference between how Bob describes how he was “freed” by Brown and later essentially forced into being part of Brown’s army: ”My marse and I was rolling to town. I heard a noise. Next thing I know, he stepped out the woods holding a rifle in marse’s face. He said, ‘I’m taking your wagon and freeing your colored man.’ He didn’t ask me if I wanted to be free. Course I come along ‘cause I had to. But I thought he was going to free me to the north. Nobody said nothing about fighting nobody.”Versus how later in the story the Old Man portrays black people and their desire to join his cause (again mirroring Onion’s earlier observation about how belief does not require truth, and certainly not in considering a black person as a person):""They will join us ‘cause we will offer them something their masters cannot: their freedom. They are thirsting for the opportunity to fight for it. They are dying to be free."". Ironic all the more as Onion puts it, during the first day of the raid on Harper’s Ferry, to count, I’d seen with my own eyes the first two folks deadened in the Old Man’s army on account of him freeing the colored was the colored themselves. Note that McBride doesn’t make Bob’s experience and perspective as a slave turned free person the only one in the book either, and shows the reader slaves and black people who are thirsting to be free, but attempting to do so without violence for themselves and loss of life. Brown’s planned raid on Harper’s Ferry is potentially interfering with and exposing a long operated section of the Underground Railroad, again throwing into stark relief the agency and will of slaves to escape and black people (and white allies) to assist them with the white-centered approaches of Brown and the righteous abolitionists and some of the pro-slavers. They have opposing views that lead them to be deadly enemies to be sure, but they can both be easily callous and indifferent to the actual needs of black people and that disregard is built into the system for both sides. For example, in the heart of abolitionist America, Onion sees that black voices outside of Mr. Douglass are nowhere to be found (and how that silence is another form of violence against black people) when the evils of slavery and the need for overthrowing the South and killing rebels is praised: It made me a bit sad, truth be to tell it, to watch them hundreds of white folks crying for the Negro, for there weren’t hardly ever any Negroes present at most of them gatherings, and them that was there was doodied up and quiet as a mouse. It seemed to me the whole business of the Negro’s life out there weren’t no different than it was out west, to my mind. It was like a big, long lynching. Everybody got to make a speech about the Negro but the NegroEven in (for me) the novel’s last humorous moment towards the end, there’s a damning of some of the characters for failing to recognize that Onion is a boy and has been the whole time, but it’s made funny and also sad in that one of the few white people to recognize Onion as a boy probably does so from a perspective of understanding the value of Onion as property, not as a human being:The soldier smirked. “Her?” he said. “That’s a he, sir,” he scolded. “Can’t y’all tell your n—s one from the other? No wonder y’all got insurrections all ‘round here. You treat your colored so damn bad you don’t know one from the other. We’d never treat our n—s this way in Alabama.”I’ve spoken less than some other s about the Old Man, aka John Brown, as a character, and that’s because in my reading, most of this novel belongs to Onion. The Old Man also doesn’t change much in the narrative; instead through Onion’s eyes and recollections, we watch John Brown morph from the odd looking old guy getting a haircut in Dutch Henry’s, to a zealous, brutal abolitionist with a propensity for overly long and sometimes untimely sermons, to a horror story or boogeyman that rebels swap tall tales about, to finally a doomed, failed revolutionary transformed into a legendary martyr and spark of the Civil War: as Onion puts it, I do believe he done more against slavery in them last six weeks with letter writings and talking than he ever done raising one gun or sword.. And Onion comes to see that the war is somewhat inevitable and so John Brown was divinely chosen to set things in motion to free all slaves, but we as the reader can certainly also interrogate Brown’s actions and ideas that don’t align with that vision of freedom.Ultimately, The Good Lord Bird is successful because even as a piece of historical fiction and satirical comedy, it has important things to say not just about America of the 1850s but America today, and the long arc towards freedom and justice and equality has been a long time coming and a long time deferred, denied, and violently suppressed. It’s hard, especially as a biracial and black person myself, not to despair sometimes when considering the hundreds of years of systemic racism and dehumanization we’ve faced in forms and garb that simply mutate to reflect the changing times. But this book reminded me that even for those despairing and even in the face of seemingly overwhelming odds and death and destruction, things can move towards improvement and betterment, and the novel does this while also having real empathy for the emotional and intellectual burden faced. Some things in this world just ain’t meant to be, not in the times we want ‘em to, and the heart has to hold it in this world as a remembrance, a promise for the world that’s to come. There’s a prize at the end of all of it, but still, that’s a heavy load to bear....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Jun 12, 2020","Jun 14, 2020","Oct 12, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16171272-the-good-lord-bird

I'd read lines I like, and go back and read them again, and look for more ideas, and look for links, and... well, I guess I got lost reading it in the best way possible, which is pretty high praise for a novel.At staged rallies, for instance, or appearances at malls, or whenever TV or radio is present you are apt at some point to be lovingly mobbed by everyday Americans eager to show their gratitude, then other times it's like you're invisible, people just see right through you, nothing registers. Billy and Mango stand there eating scalding hot pizza and know that their fame is not their own. Mainly it's another thing to laugh about, this huge floating hologram of context and cut that leads everyone around by the nose, Bravo included, but Bravo can laugh and feel somewhat superior because they know they're being used. Of course they do, manipulation is their air and element, for what is a soldier's job but to be the pawn of higher?  Wear this, say that, go there, shoot them, then of course there's the final and ultimate be killed. Every Bravo is a PhD in the art and science of duress.The plot itself doesn't elapse over too much time: it's the end of the Victory Tour for the Bravos, instant stars in a 24 hour news cycle for defending a fallen comrade and holding off and killing insurgents in an outnumbered situation. They return home heroes, paraded around the country for media interviews and morale boosting. In the events of the novel, the Bravos are at a Cowboys-Bears game on Thanksgiving Day, and our protagonist, Billy, is bombarded with ideas and emotion as he navigates the day ahead of another deployment back to Iraq. Billy and his company, especially Dime and the deceased Shroom, are a wide ranging group of men with true brotherhood and camaraderie but also all with their own insecurities and demons from their war experiences or just from their real lives. Billy wonders which is his true existence on a number of occasions, and has to make a distinct choice by the end that tips his reality firmly into one camp or another.One can definitely get war book fatigue in the modern era, but all are not the same, nor are all created equally. Ben Fountain's setting on the home front in between deployments is unique, as is putting the Bravos in a position to confront head on the commercialization of war. My emotion and heart were completely invested in Billy's thoughts and choices. This 19 year old boy/man, virginal and lusting, smart but not fully educated, a war hero and in search of leadership or inspiration, we see the whole spectacle watching over Billy's shoulder. We're as proud of him as the adoring fans who come up to him and ask the same questions, but through Billy's thoughts we also ask ourselves, the readers of the home front, if its fair for us to have put Billy in the position we have, to send him multiple times to fight wars against unknown enemies for increasingly tenuous reasons, to make a not fully grown kid become comfortable with killing and constantly putting his own, too short life in the balance. The thoughts Billy has, the things Bravo says, the way civilians interact with these briefly home heroes, there's reflection and criticism and examination for the reader there too...and thinking about it makes Billy somewhat bitter. It's not that he's jealous so much as profoundly terrified. Dread of returning to Iraq equals the direst poverty, and that's how he feels right now, poor, like a shabby homeless kid suddenly thrust in the company of millionaires. Mortal fear is the ghetto of the human soul, to be free of it something like the psychic equivalent of inheriting a hundred million dollars. This is what he truly envies of these people, the luxury of terror as a talking point, and at this moment he feels so sorry for himself that he could break right down and cry.""So the subject is heavy, but man is the writing fun! It ranges from really smart, clever quotes and artfully arranged sentences, to just snappy dialogue that is incredibly revealing about the characters who utter the words. The Bravos are funny despite/because of their surreal situation: at a Cowboys game rubbing shoulders with Hollywood producers and rich power brokers and gorgeous cheerleaders for their last ""free"" day before shipping out back to Iraq. It can be a macabre sense of humor, but it's also silly, crude, smart. I chuckled, grinned, and in some parts I laughed out loud. This is a book with so much feeling, so much verve, I haven't been this entertained and informed since The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao. Fountain's prose keeps you off balance and on your toes, but also pushes you into humor just when you think things are getting serious. ""Mango grins, cuts Billy a look. 'Dude,' he tells Hector, 'we already going back.'Hector squints. 'Shittin' me.''Shit you not. Leaving Saturday.''The fuck you gotta go back.''Gotta finish our tour.''The fuck! The fuck you gotta go back, after all you fuckin' done, fuckin' heroes? Where's the fuckin' right in that? You guys done kicked your share a ass, like when's they let you just coast on out?'Mango laughs. 'The Army don't work that way. They need bodies.''Shit.' Hector is scandalized. 'For how long you gotta go?''Eleven months.''Fuck!' Sheer outrage. 'You wanna go back?'The Bravos snort.'Man. Fuckin' harsh. That just ain't right.' Hector casts about. 'Ain't they supposed to be making a movie about you?'Uh huh.'And you still gotta go back? Fuck, so what happens if you, uh, you, uh-''Get smoked?' Billy offers.Hector turns away, stricken.'No worries, homes,' Mango says, 'that's a totally different movie.' ""Overall, I found this a great read, with really dynamic, interesting characters set more or less around a day in the life of Billy and the Bravos, one pivotal, surreal day of ""home"" life in between being at war. And in addition to being highly entertaining and fun, Fountain also manages to inform and provoke and get you as the reader to ask some occasionally uncomfortable questions of yourself. There were parts that I found slightly heavy handed or didn't work quite as well as others (Billy falling in love with the Cowboys cheerleader and their encounter, the meeting with the Jerry Jones stand in), but overall I liked it a lot, would enthusiastically recommend it, and would probably re-read it in the future....more",Notes are private!,0,30,1,"Oct 12, 2016","Nov 08, 2016","Oct 12, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13325079-billy-lynn-s-long-halftime-walk

Jane Chisolm is born in early 20th century Mississippi with what's described as urogenital sinus anomaly and persistent cloaca, ultimately resulting in incontinence and an inability to be physically intimate with others. Brad Watson's novel revolves mostly around Jane's childhood into early adulthood, only lightly touching on later times of her life, and I was quietly swept away by his simple, affecting prose, beautiful descriptions, and charged emotions as Jane's world opens and closes in stages. Her existence is perhaps challenged and troubled at times, but I never pitied Jane: Watson walks an admirable line to make Jane's ""tale of woe"" (to borrow from another literary Jane) poignant and specific and sad and affirming, without becoming overly dramatic on either front, neither too maudlin nor too saccharine. It's masterfully crafted, and Jane such a quiet force of nature and feeling, I couldn't help but love and admire this little read, and indeed I wish there had been more of it, more phrases and descriptions to read, more time to spend inhabiting Jane's world. I'll add more thoughts later, but for now: five stars, recommended for lovers of literary fiction who don't mind a quiet read with beautiful writing and strong characterization....more",Notes are private!,0,44,1,"Jan 11, 2017","Jan 12, 2017","Oct 12, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/26530309-miss-jane

I managed to read this in my afternoon downtime. The Accidental Empress is enjoyable and occasionally engaging, though I do feel the author allows characters to fill stereotypes/caricatures to make them more relatable and possibly de-complicates them to advance the plot, so it's not a significant or important read. Very lighthearted historical fiction, maybe almost soap-y in its treatment. I realize part can be chalked up to the perspective coming only from Sisi, the titular Accidental Empress, but it makes it read more as a coming of age story of a woman and Empress, rather than giving me a better glimpse at the Habsburg Empire as I had expected. And it reduces major figures like Count Andrassy to exotic, foreign would be lover and Sisi's main problem is her domineering mother in law and her frustrations in the bedroom. That's where things can get silly and reductive, and Sisi is diminished from what her real life eccentric self seemed to be. I also found myself not loving Pataki's writing style, but I'm more partial to some scenery chewing, some great turns of phrase, and overall writing that captures and conveys great mood and emotion and sense of time and place. Her prose is clear and her plot zips along, but the writing itself is not a reason to read it. It's pleasant, but workmanlike, moving Sisi and the story along but not entertaining in its own right.And unfortunately there's not tons of Budapest in this book: perhaps more in the sequel? But it was easy to read at least, and for a traveler to Austria and/or Hungary, many sights and historic moments occur in palaces, museums, churches, and other prominent places you're likely to visit, so it's nice background.Overall: solid, pleasant historical fiction of the rise to womanhood of Sisi, Empress of Austria and Hungary. I liked it fine for what it was - soapy, not serious light fiction - but I didn't respond to the writing enough to move onto the sequel....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Oct 14, 2016","Oct 14, 2016","Oct 12, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22609307-the-accidental-empress

At face value, it's a cold case whodunit concerning the murder of a prominent psychologist and Princeton educBook of Mirrors grew on me as I read it. At face value, it's a cold case whodunit concerning the murder of a prominent psychologist and Princeton educator, but it's also a meditation on how we as humans remember things, forget things, and invent things in our memories and our pasts, consciously and unconsciously. It also has a nice undercurrent of how relationships and moments are reflected in the eyes of different people, and how each person sees the past, present and future through their own individual prism of thought and need and desire.The novel is told in three parts: first from the perspective of literary agent Peter Katz, who receives a mysterious partial manuscript from a Richard Flynn that is purportedly nonfiction concerning the 1987 murder of Professor Jospeh Wieder; then from John Keller, a former journalist that Katz hires to research the background of Flynn's manuscript and locate the missing second half; and finally from Roy Freeman, the ex-cop who worked the Wieder case and was Keller interviewed, prompting him to re-canvas and put the puzzle pieces together. You're never in Katz's perspective for long: he sets things in motion by receiving the manuscript, but it's mostly from the manuscript and Richard Flynn's first person account that we get the initial perspective and set up.Because it's our first perspective, I started by following the trail Richard was laying out in terms of the ""facts"" of the situation. As John and then Roy start to pull on various threads and webs, what were secondary characters become spotlight suspects and witnesses, and everyone's relationship with and viewpoint of everyone else is both clarified and called into question. And the blurred lines between truth and fiction, fact and invention are thrust into the forefront. The touch on Roy's Alzheimer's serves to further underline the fleeting and limited grasp of the human brain to remember.The writing is just ok to fine: I found Chirovici to do a better job showcasing the myriad reflections of the characters in the whodunit drama of 1987 and present (Laura, Richard, Wieder) than being able to provide truly different voices for our ostensible narrators Peter, John, and Roy. There weren't enough stylistic and tonal difference, for example, between John, a thirty something well educated journalist working for a check , and Roy, an aged black ex-cop pursuing his cold case out of the pursuit of justice and righting mistakes before his mind permanently betrays him. Overall, this is a fairly entertaining, easy read thriller-type that does present some interesting (though not new) ideas about how humans view, catalogue, and remember events and people. But it's nothing transcendent of the genre. Fun and mostly forgettable, but I did like it.

But I was able to get this on edelweiss for free, and figured I'd take a look as Mata Hari was a historical figure I knew little about other than the broadest ideas: sensual dancer turned spy. The Spy is a short little read, only 84 pages for my electronic copy. It's told in an epistolary format, with letters from Mata Hari to her daughter and attorney, and then a letter from that attorney to Mata Hari. But within those letters and in just 84 pages, Coelho attempts to take us through Mata Hari's progression through life and her death as an accused spy during WWI.In a lot of ways I ended up wondering why Coelho felt he needed to write this book. The characters are all pretty flat, not fully fleshed out, rough sketches, and I'm not sure if I felt that way because of the translation, the letter format, or both. Even though we are seeing from Mata Hari's perspective, I don't really feel like I gained tremendous insight into her motivations or actions. We're told over and over that all of her actions were in pursuit of an independent, free life, not really possible at the time for a woman according to her, but it doesn't entirely add up as most of her decisions leave her at the mercy of one man or another and their egos and machinations. That's probably the most profound part of Coelho's work: he inverts the image of Mata Hari as a femme fatale, and instead from her being raped by her schoolteacher to being brutalized by her husband to being convicted with scant evidence and shot by firing squad, its revealed that Mata Hari is truly a victim. If the writing/translation had been better, I may have gone with three stars, but because everything felt a bit flat and the letter format minimized characterization, two stars is as much as I'd like to give it....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Nov 03, 2016","Nov 13, 2016","Oct 11, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30686326-the-spy

So the appeal of NotwithstanI will begin with stating that I have never read anything by de Bernières, I am American, and I am just thirty years old. So the appeal of Notwithstanding in terms of its nostalgia and mirror to a part of England's past in its more provincial areas completely eludes me. I happened to come across this title, and it generally is not something to my taste or interest, so I didn't expect it to do much for me.That said, I was pleasantly surprised by the detailed, woven stories of the inhabitants of Notwithstanding, the fictional English village that our author brings to life in a full way. None of he characters we meet are cardboard cutouts, all have fully realized lives, idiosyncrasies, and eccentricities. I was taken by the number of very serious, sharply observed ideas about people and human nature and past versus present, and the fairly seamless way these ideas are peppered amidst a very cute, quaint overall package, for example in observing how modern visitors or transplants to Notwithstanding view the last, long tenured peasant of the town:"" Jack is considered a 'character', with his teeth like tombstones, his stubble like a filecard, his lips like kippers, his rolling Surrey accent and his eyes as wide as plates, but newcomers avoid him if they can. They moved here in search of picture-postcard England, and are uncomfortable with a real countryman who knows how to wring the necks of a chicken and has no compunction about drowning kittens in a bucket. Jack is an anachronism, but he does not know it...""There's humor and warmth in the writing too, even if what remains strongest is the sense of nostalgia and the larger theme of death and the passage of time: most of the stories revolve around it, which makes sense as part of a larger lament to the death of a bygone time, place, and feeling united in England. Indeed, de Bernières seems to position the whole collection so that the reader feels they have the same overall view of the work as in this quote about a character's view of the land around him: ""The England that Peter saw, and Allingham before him, was the England that the English used to love, when England was still loved by the English."" Overall, I found the writing of good overall quality, and de Bernières style and observation made for a pleasant experience. It only falls to three stars for me because it can be a bit too precious and so is best read in small doses rather than one long sitting, and though many books set in Britain I have no trouble connecting with, it's overwhelming English-ness of a particular time/place ilk occasionally left me out as a modern, non English, understanding contextual clues but perhaps missing some larger emotion and certainly missing the nostalgia de Bernières is hoping to convey....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Oct 11, 2016","Oct 15, 2016","Oct 11, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/29663064-notwithstanding

And while plenty of Gothic and Victorian novels and stories had been present across school reading lists, Bram Stoker's Dracula was never required reading. Reading Dracula now, and being mindful of what followed and what came before thought trying not to let it disrupt the reading, I can say it's a pretty enjoyable horror story that keeps the creepy tension wound throughout, utilizes its epistolary form well, and thought undone a bit by a weak ending, is overall a satisfying read and a classic that stands up well against time.The influences and time of Stoker's writings are readily apparent to me: I can see the threads tying this to earlier Gothic works like Frankenstein and the stories of Edgar Allan Poe, but it's also entirely of its time and is a hybrid of Gothic horror with expanded Victorian adventure writing, of a similar feeling to the works of H Rider Haggard and Robert Louis Stevenson. The adventure and horror are both able to deliver because of strong atmospheric writing and a pretty solid cast of characters that the reader becomes acquainted with, and I at least had no trouble believing in their friendship and their quest. Their quest is specifically to liberate Mina Murray Harker from certain UnDeadness and the clutches of Dracula, and more generally to end the threat of Dracula to London and indeed the world. The five men of the group - Jonathan Harker, van Helsing, Seward, Quincey Morris, John Seward, and Arthur Holmwood - are passionate, emotional, brave, righteous men, and their bonds with each other and their collective dedication for Mina move us through the jnournal entries and letters and wish for them to put the puzzle pieces together and thwart the foes that confront them and their loved ones in the darkness.Mina Harker is the best character in the book by far. Though she is set up in some ways as a damsel in distress, her life and soul in the balance in the struggle against Dracula, she is full of agency, of calm, of inner strength and faith. She's also smart, helping van Helsing first come to understand the threat by uniting his knowledge of Lucy's state with Jonathan's journal from his travels, and later seeing into the mind of Dracula to track his movements and pursue him. It's not a feminist novel or anything like that - indeed the classic Madonna/whore dichotomy is explored when reading of the purity and innocence of Lucy pre vampirism, and of her evil voluptuousness (and that of the brides) after becoming UnDead. But Stoker's Mina is not an object nor solely a motivation to the men: she is beloved by them for herself, not simply as some paragon of virtue or innocence, and indeed without her knowledge and understanding and fortitude, the entire quest may have failed, or never gotten off the ground.One weak point for me in Dracula is there's not enough Dracula. He's creepy and threatening during Jonathan's time in Eastern Europe, he's certainly altogether evil and frightening when the men confront him biting and assaulting Mina, but other than that we don't see him often, instead facing threats poised by Lucy, by his brides, by Renfield, and other lesser evils/horrors. I understand why, when looking at the tale with modern eyes, many add history and motivations to Dracula (i.e. The Vlad the Impaler link, Mina as a reincarnation of a previous love/wife, etc) since he doesn't appear to offer any motivations and at times his decisions and actions seem of faulty logic. On the other hand, those modern impulses serve to humanize Dracula in a way, and I like that here, we have what vampires were meant to be: pure monsters, pure evil. Sure I believe Stoker wants us to see that humanity is capable of monstrous evil, and indeed can be turned to such things, but the idea is to struggle against it and stay in the light of goodness and righteousness. The modern vampire suffers a bit, defanged if you will, once its violent, undiscriminating predation is surrounded by motivations (and sparkles, but I digress).I liked Stoker's writing style for the most part, even if some of the character voices could be indistinct from each other on occasion. Stoker definitely masters setting a scene and portraying mood. And the main points of view - Mina, Jonathan, Seward and van Helsing - are well developed and differentiated, even if I found the manner of Stoker's rendering of van Helsing's ""Dutch"" accent a bit irritating (and I put Dutch in quotes because though the character comes from Amsterdam, he sure speaks a decent amount of German).Overall, I'd give the read four stars for enjoying the writing style and presenting a great hybrid of horror-adventure. It loses a star for me for the very weak ending and the lack of Dracula for much of the novel. But as the main point of genesis for much of the modern obsession with vampires, it holds up well, and in fact, modern fictional works might do well to allow more of the horror/evil of the creatures to sneak back in, and less of the humanizing and love struck stuff so common today....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Oct 14, 2016","Oct 15, 2016","Oct 11, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17245.Dracula

Re-reading Sorcerer's Stone, I'm struck by how great Rowling was at imbuing the wizarding world with pure wonder and delight and magic, and though there are dark elements at the edges, this is truly a book for children. The series grew up as Harry did, as he gained greater control over his abilities and grew into his own as a man, so too did the writing and storytelling reflect Harry's expanded, more knowledgeable view of his world. That's probably why Prisoner of Azkaban, Goblet of Fire and Order of the Phoenix are my favorite volumes in this series: it's where Harry's perspective on magic and on people expands rapidly, and is forced to confront things he thought he knew and re-evaluate them, and our own knowledge and love of this world is greatly broadened as a result. But here, at the beginning, we don't know all of what's to come for Harry. We just know how incredibly exciting this world is, filled with whimsy and beauty and power, a space for brave deeds and strong friendship and still revel in the pleasures of being a child. It's a fantastic stand alone book, a great world for a child or adolescent to dive into (probably especially great for a more reluctant reader, since they'll turn the pages so fast and have delight in the things Harry is seeing and doing, they'll forget they're reading), and a nice entry point to an entire universe of unlimited storytelling potential and reader enjoyment. This was a re-read (for probably the 50th time or so, I've lost count), and since there's no need for a traditional , here are the things that grabbed me on this go round:I must still be very much in touch with my childhood self, because the humor (that is very juvenile appropriate) still makes me laugh, even tiny little lines: With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. after a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick...  That Smelting stick just kills me.""So you mean the Stone's only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to Snape?"" said Hermione in alarm.""It'll be gone by next Tuesday,"" said Ron. “Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!”Dumbledore. Perhaps Rowling's greatest character in the series. My personal take is Dumbledore is truly a somewhat eccentric man and given to whimsy, but does indulge in that image and plays it up to keep his adversaries and enemies off balance and underestimate him. I toe the line between the kindly, grandfatherly Dumbledore and the Machiavellian, greater good Dumbledore. But my Dumbledore is almost always intelligent and is most certainly compassionate and a believer of the good in people.When Hagrid gives Norbert to Harry and Hermione, he puts Norbert's teddy bear in the crate so he won't get lonely: Norbert promptly decapitates the teddy bear. ""Do you think he meant you to do it?"" said Ron. ""Sending you your father's cloak and everything?""""Well,"" Hermione exploded, ""if he did - I mean to say that's terrible - you could have been killed.""From here, thousands of manipulative Dumbledore fanfics were born! ...more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,"Dec 18, 2016","Dec 23, 2016","Oct 11, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3.Harry_Potter_and_the_Sorcerer_s_Stone

But there's much more here as Marina journeys from Minnesota to Manaus to the depths of the Amazon jungle. Knowing that there's a definite nod to Heart of Darkness, we're confronted with various ethical and moral questions about how these well educated Western doctors interact and interfere with the native tribes of the Amazon, and what should or shouldn't be allowed or compromised in the name of science and progress. There is the mystery of Anders' fate to unravel, and the details of the two very important developments coming from the research.Character wise, Marina is our protagonist and guide, and though she begins the story with less real personality and backbone and individual ideas, her physical and emotional journey is well fleshed out, facing demons from her past and triumphing, until at the end we see her as a more confident, capable woman. Most of the secondary characters are just fine without being especially memorable, but her previous mentor Dr Swenson and the deaf tribal boy Easter are both incredibly well-drawn. Dr Swenson begins in our view as a tyrannical genius of intense purpose and gravity, but as Marina draws deeper into the jungle and more of the science is revealed and new moral and ethical questions are asked (and not always answered), Dr Swenson is far more fully represented, her edges softening, shedding the borderline archetype she had been to be more of a true character. Easter by contrast is filled with humanity, light and darkness both, the goodness and strangeness and evils of people all coming into contact with him from childhood to young adulthood. In some ways, he is pure love, all of his relationships are generated from that emotion, and his competence and confidence also stem from that.Why this all worked for me is because Patchett's writing and ability to transport us to the Amazon is amazing. I really felt immersed in the setting, seeing the river, meeting the tribes, feeling the rain. Her descriptions are lush yet subtle, a weird dichotomy that lines up with the nature of the jungle itself. Her description of Marina's visit to the opera house is gorgeous and well rounded, and the anaconda scene is so well written and genuinely terrifying I thought I might succumb to nightmares like many of the characters do throughout, whether drug induced or otherwise.I do think in some ways to enjoy this you have to submit to the pull of the writing and give in to the occasional lapse of logic, and sort of surrender to the titular state of wonder Marina is in and that we ourselves are supposed to be in as we experience this hidden, dangerous, fascinating world. The suspension of disbelief is key, and after previous mediocre reads, I was ready and willing to be transported, and because I was caught by the writing I could forgive some of the plot bumps. It's also unfolds a bit slowly, something I don't typically mind if the writing is working for me because that can propel me along when the plot is not moving as quickly as I might like (clearly, since I bombed through this book and read it in a day).My biggest issue with the novel is its ending. While it didn't ruin the book, it did completely break the spell, and I felt very differently about the last 10 pages than I had about the proceeding 320 some odd pages. I won't spoil it for new readers, but suffice it to say I thought the betrayal devastating and infuriating, and I couldn't suspend my disbelief to think that the character who was the betrayer would act in that manner toward the victim. The subsequent, seemingly random moment of intimacy was also somewhat odd, but less infuriating than what it followed. I did like Marina's clear drive at the conclusion, open ended as to where she would go, what path she would take, but still bringing her to the forefront and in control of her own destiny, versus the start where she'd say yes to whoever asked anything of her and was somewhat passively directing the affairs of her life.Overall, I found this to be a beautifully written read, one that asked interesting questions and immersed me in a different world. But the ending felt a bit off in terms of the narrative, and emotionally left a bad taste in my mouth. Recognizing that I was emotional about it, I'm inclined to say it wasn't a bad ending, just off putting and oddly constructed. So I can stand firm on a 4 star ....more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,"Nov 04, 2016","Nov 05, 2016","Oct 10, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10870072-state-of-wonder

My initial response is that I was a bit underwhelmed by this bookAn Ember in the Ashes is extremely easy to read: I burned through it in a few hours. My initial response is that I was a bit underwhelmed by this book, and I expected to like this a lot more than I did based on its premise, its setting of a world modeled on Ancient Rome with a slave-soldier dichotomy as the main perspectives, and the near universal praise I've seen and heard on Goodreads and from friends and booksellers. I do think my expectations were fairly neutral though, in light of coming off less fun reading experience of another highly celebrated YA book, Rebel of the Sands, and I definitely preferred An Ember in the Ashes and was certainly not bored reading it. But I was expecting a tighter, more definitively imagined world and a set of characters I felt invested in, and if the plot points were familiar they'd be done in a fresh way that brought something new - ideas, storytelling, or otherwise - to the table. I didn't feel this was the case, but I still enjoyed reading An Ember in the Ashes overall, so I'd give it a solid three star rating, and I'm at least open to reading A Torch Against the Night and seeing if there are improvements, although I'm not necessarily chomping at the bit to do so and very happy I already have a free copy of the sequel so I don't have to buy it myself.I was expecting something more original and inventive in terms of characters and storyline, and was expecting a realm I could immerse myself in. But many moments and ideas were predictable and familiar without bringing too much new to the table, and the world and major plot points felt somewhat shoddily built, though the bones are there and ripe for more development. To tackle the world first (arguably the most important thing a fantasy series needs to develop to have a successful series) we are dropped in Serra, once a city of Scholars but now under the dominion of the Martial Empire. Other than getting vague glimpses of markets and festivals, the places we as the reader are exposed to most are Blackcliff, the student academy where soldiers are trained, and catacombs and a weapons studio/forge. I never got a feel for the city of Serra itself, nor for how the Martial Empire conducts itself in terms of day to day life at a variety of levels that allows for the survival of the Empire and continued dominance of the ruling families. I also thought there may have been a bit too much introduced in the Martial Empire without enough support for concepts, and Tahir's push-pull between going the sword and sand fantasy route and the historically influenced dystopia war route felt a bit confused. The more fantastical elements are mostly teased, presumably to come into view in later books, but their introduction and the backstory of how the Martials overcame the Scholars in the first place seemed somewhat random, not fully fleshed out enough for our understanding of how these things will fit into the overall storytelling, but also not presented in a compelling enough manner to whet an appetite to find out more. I probably would have preferred the more straightforward, slave and soldier rebelling in their own ways without the djinns, efrits, and other specters. There's also some somewhat strange choices in terms of bits of the world that are revealed to us, like how rape is seemingly as standard an activity as any in the Martial Empire, and various female characters are threatened verbally or physically with the prospect of rape and rape is referenced constantly (and often in relation to a woman's attractiveness which is problematic in and of itself) but without any real emotional context or thrust. Characters were uneven on balance: our hero and heroine are Elias and Laia, and neither are particularly interesting, although I did end up rooting for them out of default, mostly because the alternative characters were even more bland and less compelling, either paragons of evil or relatively unimportant, undeveloped side characters. Laia begins as a sort of wet noodle of a person, and though I was willing to cut her some slack for losing her grandparents and watching her brother be taken right in the opening, it takes her the entire book to gain any kind of character growth, spending most intervening chapters in fear, (badly) spying on the Commandant, thinking about her brother or ogling Elias or Keenan. It also seemed like a silly plot device as Tahir sets it up to have this naive, somewhat dim girl be tasked by the Resistance to spy on the Commandant who has already discovered and had killed or maimed or brutalized previous, and presumably better trained, spies. But Laia is fairly easy to like towards the end, and as she becomes a bit more savvy of the motives of others, she takes control of her own life and rides into the rescue in a way I found surprising in a good way. Elias was the weaker character for me: he is the handsome, perfect soldier, and wants to flee the brutality of the Martial Empire and the bloodthirsty dominance of his mother. But he's more or less presented without flaws, even being in his head and perspective still makes him a bit of a cipher and he tells us what he's feeling as opposed to actually experiencing his feelings, and his own big flaw we as the reader pick up on - his inability to make a decision for the benefit of more people if the life of a woman he loves is on the line - is presented as a positive. I can argue that works in the context of the Trials (competition to become new a Emperor, on the whole quite boring if bloody, now a standard trope but here nothing new added) where he allows his friends to die not wanting to hurt Helene, but at the climax, it seems awfully shortsighted in terms of his decision making versus what Tahir has established about his thoughts about the Empire and wanting freeedom for himself and (presumably) for others. Or maybe Elias is a more selfish character than I thought; either way, he's fairly boring. Laia and Elias both are attracted to each other instantly, though they also have their own love interests. None of the romantic connections are that exciting save Helene and Elias: their backstory and friendship and comraderie are believable and well supported.On the positive side, it was fast paced and fairly well written (even if the modern dialogue seemed at odds with the Ancient Roman influenced backdrop). I liked the Augurs and their creepy, auspicious role in events that seem both to serve and at odds with the Empire. I liked the idea of the Tribal desert people, their storytelling techniques. I thought Helene was very well drawn, I'd like to see more of her, her backstory, and her developing new talents against the increasing darkness and fantastical backdrop. I liked Laia's brother Darien and his mentor Spiro Teluman. I liked Cook and her warnings to Laia about the Resistance and about the Commandant. And I think with the world she's created, and the set up for further adventures and a climatic showdown, Tahir has some elements that could form a strong series, especially if the character development and worldbuilding detail and logic are better advanced in A Torch Against the Night. So while I don't think this leaps into great fantasy or great YA, I found it mostly fun and I liked it, enough to eventually pick up the sequel. But I also don't see myself re-reading this book unless great leaps forward happen with the worldbuilding and storytelling of subsequent books....more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,"Jan 07, 2017","Jan 07, 2017","Oct 10, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/27774758-an-ember-in-the-ashes

And though so much will break your heart, it will ache with gladness too, for Hayes writes, sees, feels, appreciates the simple and complex beauty of human life, and articulately of the mesmerizing urban jungle that is New York, and his book is a celebration of love. Love that can unite people and bring people together, from small interactions in a skateboard park to the deep, soul touching love Bill and O experience together. It's so well written, and yet also incredibly raw, delighting and saddening me in alternating states. It's really more of a collection of ideas, feelings, journal entries, thoughts of Bill Hayes than anything, but the book seems to be a written embodiment of his own state, so it feels extremely authentic and I never felt lost or confused as we jumped in time, space and medium. ""Wouldn't it be nice if there were a planet where the sound of rain falling is like Bach?""Oliver Sacks is the immediate draw, a brilliant man but not overly well-known in a personal way by most who ""disappeared"" (Hayes' verb of choice in lieu of ""passed away"") too soon by anyone's reckoning since the fate of man is inevitable, but always too soon. The depth of feeling pervades for me even a week after reading it, and how charmed I was by these two incredible individuals finding each other in the universe, and getting such an intimate look into the mind of Oliver Sacks. His intelligence, whimsy, and tenderness jump off the page in such beautiful moments and anecdotes as Hayes gives us unparalleled access to their love. I: ""What else can I do for you?""O: ""Exist.""Just before midnight, I taught O how to open a bottle of champagne, something he had never done before: sweet to see the joy and surprise and fear on his face as - pop! - the cork exploded. He had insisted on wearing his swimming goggles, though, just in case.It's also a book that will call to those from New York, living in New York, or dreaming of New York. Hayes too dreamed of moving to the city, and though he's honest about its detriments and less glamorous nature, it's such a deep, full throated embrace of the city and its people across all walks of life. Throughout the memoir, Hayes' photography illustrates his life with Oliver, but also New York's glamorous buildings and unknown inhabitants, and Hayes candidly and otherwise captures beautiful human moments of strangers, acquaintances, friends, and lovers. I got the feeling that I would feel incredibly lucky and serendipitous to have an interaction with Bill Hayes on the subway, one of those nice, hey why don't I talk to strangers more often, wow that guy is amazing kind of moments that I don't have as often as I should. Hayes shows us New York, not in a new way but in so much love with this city, warts and all, that I've been more open to a random moment in the shuffle, keeping my headphones off, looking up with a smile.I remember how Wendy once told me she loved New York so much she couldn't bear the thought of it going on without her. It seemed like both the saddest and the most romantic thing one could possibly say - sad because New York can never return the sentiment, and sad because it's the kind of thing said more often about a romantic love - husband, wife, girlfriend, partner, lover. You can't imagine them going on without you. But they do. We do. Every day, we may wake up and say, What's the point? Why go on? And, there is really only one answer: To be alive. And its specific tale is no less beautiful or important than the larger takeaway for me of a full embrace of one's life and everything in it, understanding the limits of time imposed on us and appreciating the magic high and mundane that life is while we're here to live it. Ultimately it urges you to reconsider with fresh eyes the world you inhabit, see it for all its attributes good and bad, reach out to its inhabitants also orbiting in similar spaces and revel in the power of human connection, whether simple and small or life changing and grandiose, or both at the same time, a worthy idea in an age fueled by the internet that can make it easier and paradoxically harder to truly connect. I can't fully put into words how meaningful a read this was for me, and I can only recommend it to everyone I know loudly for its individual story and universal appeal. But if you're a fan of Oliver Sacks, or a lover of New York who maybe hasn't had as much time to appreciate the inner details of the city, or if you're in a transitory phase like me and just need a hint of a spark of humanity to connect with and respond to and feel less alone, meet Bill Hayes.

I have very mixed feelings about this book. As an elevated beach read type of book, I think Eligible more or less works on the Eligible, oh Eligible. I have very mixed feelings about this book. As an elevated beach read type of book, I think Eligible more or less works on the whole. As a ""modern retelling of Pride and Prejudice"", it hit highs and lows, and is probably average overall versus the Austen sequel/retelling/zombie-fied other titles out there. As a work of literary fiction, the humorous writing is strong, but the observational and storytelling aspects felt fairly unoriginal: I was expecting sly, incisive prose in observing modern mating rituals and social tribes of the 21st century in America as Austen had her wit and wisdom in spades observing those rituals and patterns of the landed gentry in 18th century England, and instead felt like ideas and observations weren't fully fleshed out or written about in an intelligent way. This was most noticeable when Sittenfeld tried to tackle things like race or sex or orientation, it came off trite and forced, as though these things were being shoehorned in to show how inclusively she could expand Austen's world. That said, it was very easy reading, and I did enjoy parts of my reading experience. I vacillated between two and three stars, but ultimately chose to go with three stars: despite some of the problems I had with it, I liked it well enough during and it faded from my mind quickly enough, though I suppose I should say I only read it because it set out to ""update"" Pride and Prejudice, and having read it, I can say now I really didn't need to read this at all, but I could see this bringing up some good discussion. But for Austen fans, it's probably worth picking up and skimming the early chapters to see if it's for you.Rather than a full  (since P&P is fairly well known in terms of plot), I'll highlight what did and did not work for me, and why. What Worked for Me - The reality show Eligible  - the whole plot is framed in terms of a reality TV juggernaut show Eligible, and Bingley had been the past ""bachelor"" that the Bennets (minus Jane and Mr. Bennet) had watched, and his move to Cincinnati and return to practicing medicine inspired a strong update on the families of the area gossiping from Austen's time: instead, Googling and re-watching the season provide the background info. I wasn't sure how this would work, but I thought Sittenfeld did a really nice job incorporating the show and reality TV culture into the P&P plot: Caroline Bingley is now trying to use her brother to advance her own career and thrust him into spin-offs and reunions to build his brand.- Mr. Bennet  - while not quite as smart or as generous or even as good a father as the original Mr. Bennet, this updated version gets most of the best one and two liners in the novel, and his sarcasm, wit, and general unconcern for the feelings of his wife and others made him a nice, scene-stealing character in this update. As examples:-in relation to Chip Bingley being called the crybaby from the previous season of Eligible after being pursued by twenty-five women:  ""I don't suppose that any of you can appreciate the terror a man might feel being so outnumbered,"" Mr. Bennet said. ""I often weep, and there are only six of you."" -about downsizing their home to save money: ""If your mother and I lived somewhere smaller, we might have to actually see each other.""-after Liz somewhat strong arms Dr. Lucas into a payment plan and questions if mistakes had been made with her father's bill:  ""She shows her gratitude by accusing the people who saved my life of malfeasance,"" Mr. Bennet said. ""As you can imagine, her mother and I are very proud."" -Side Characters Charlotte Lucas I might say is even better fleshed out in Eligible than in the original, and her union with Willie, who is not quite as cringe worthy as the original Mr. Collins, provides some entertainment and obersvation about real aspects of coupledom. Caroline Bingley is a more open, obvious bitch, but is fun for some moments of snark, and where she ultimately ends up feels entirely accurate and on point.  What Didn't Work for Me -Liz Bennet. Granted, there's a lot to live up to in terms of Austen's Elizabeth, a beloved, memorable, spirited, intelligent, passionate heroine who is absolutely up there in the pantheon of great female characters in literature. I honestly found this Liz Bennet to be fairly dull in comparison: competent at her job but relatively unambitious, in love with an (extremely) emotionally unavailable man for years (one of the Wickhams in the retelling), and apt to behave more like a twenty-something in terms of her reactions and dialogue, rather than a thirty-eight year old woman IMO. I'd also say that outside of Jane, we get the feeling that Liz takes care of (really nags and manages) her family out of obligation rather than desire, and she has little good feelings about any of them. In Pride and Prejudice, Elizabeth feels the mortification of her family's impropriety, but we're also aware of her genuine love for her father, her efforts to help straighten out Kitty, her easy relationship with Aunt and Uncle Gardiner. There's no such familial ties here for this Liz. And ultimately, Liz is just not as smart, as sparkling, as fun as Elizabeth Bennet, so the parts between Liz and Darcy are nowhere near as compelling as the interactions between Elizabeth and Darcy in the original. So that's a pretty big miss for me on this book.-Big Issues  Sittenfeld kind of sprinkles racism, transphobia, sexual orientation, anti-Semitism, and general ignorance throughout, and it's not done subtly or with any transcendent point or idea in mind. Most of the these thoughts and ideas are fed to Mrs. Bennet. In the original, we're always aware of the flaws of Mrs. Bennet - she's an ill-mannered, boastful, social-climbing, anxious, childish woman, but she's a source of amusement and she is genuinely concerned with the welfare of her daughters (and herself) since the estate is entailed to Mr. Collins. Here, she is a crude, ignorant bigot who has a shopping addiction and a limited worldview, and her hateful remarks about blacks, Jews, Asians, and trans people go more or less uncorrected by Liz or the other Bennet family members (with one exception late in the game). I suppose Sittenfeld assumes her reading audience will look down on Mrs. Bennet for her views, but it's still cringe-worthy as a reader to see   ""Liz, I don't know if Kitty and Shane are serious, but life can be very hard for mulatto children.""  and  ""He always had a funny look in his eye, and I didn't trust him""   about the trans character go basically unchallenged by other characters in the novel. On sexual orientation, Mary's assumed closet lesbianism is treated as a crude joke by most members of the family, which came off very awkwardly and ignorant, and I believe Sittenfeld was trying for funny, but I honestly wasn't sure. And if Sittenfeld really dealt with the things she surfaces - interracial couples, trans and cis partners, anorexia, shopping addictions - perhaps I would be more ok, but instead these things feel deliberately invoked to portray a diverse, modern circle these Bennets are, yet because the ideas and issues aren't unpacked, and the trans and black characters don't have tremendous characterization or page time, it feels inauthentic and done for its own sake, rather than for storytelling OR to make some larger point. Even though it's set in 2013, weren't we past in the closet ribbing or fearing for biracial children by that point? I felt these big issues were introduced but not well executed, in some ways exploited to add surface diversity and complication, but ended up interfering with what could have been more a straightforward modern retelling. And from other s, I can see that some readers found this off-putting to the point of being distasteful, so this approach also alienated some of the audience.- Marriages  - Lydia's elopement (and the updated emergency needed to spur Liz to go home) was always going to happen from a storytelling perspective. I could even understand Jane agreeing to a quick marriage with Bingley based on her particular circumstances. But Liz and Darcy's engagement felt untrue to modern mores and the relationship that Sittenfeld built for them (which mostly consisted of snark and hate sex and only touched on true friendship and bonding). I felt like this area was one in which the modern retelling would not follow the original in lockstep, since dating practices have evolved as much as they have since the 18th century.What Was Missing - Lady Catherine De Bourgh / Kathy de Bourgh  Now, Kathy is a feminist icon Liz interviews in her capacity as a journalist for  Mascara , the magazine she writes for. And their conversation and Kathy's quotes are mildly interesting within the confines of this novel. But Lady Catherine's disapproval of Liz's family and a prospective match between her and Darcy is therefore reassigned to Caroline Bingley, and the ""climactic"" showdown is pretty benign, amounting to little more than a cat fight between rivals for Darcy's affections. I didn't even pick up on what the scene was supposed to be at first, and only after it ended did I understand that this little blip was meant to replace the absolute classic scene between Elizabeth and Lady Catherine in the original. ""Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?""  is modernized into Caroline saying ""It's not a secret that your dad bankrupted your family. Your mom and sisters are idiots, and now you have a tranny brother-in-law. You're not girlfriend material for Fitzwilliam Darcy.""  All I can say to that is IT IS NOT TO BE BORNE. -it is also a crime to not equal in spirit or even give a chance to showcase the best sentimental moment of Mr. Bennet from the original: "" 'Well my dear', said he, when she ceased speaking, 'I have no more to say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.' ""  That said, this Liz is kind of bland, and Darcy (though better comparatively with his original) is also not much more than a handsome neurosurgeon, so I suppose Mr. Bennet would have no one to say it to.At any rate, it's a read that engenders discussion, positively or negatively, and there's a lot to talk about, so I'd ultimately say it's worth reading and is mostly entertaining, though its success as a modern retelling of Pride and Prejudice is very much subjective, and I was quite mixed in my overall feelings on this read....more",Notes are private!,0,64,1,Jan 2017,"Jan 06, 2017","Oct 07, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25852870-eligible

If I remove myself a bit from what I just read, I note implausible dialogue and somewhat unbelievable plot elements, horrifically selfish and nasty main characters, overflowing with evil, sure, but mostly with ennui and snobbery and drunkenness and poor-little-rich-people and an air of erudition that's more smokescreen than substance.I can admit to all of that objectively. Subjectively, I feverishly read this in a day and found it literally unputdownable, obscuring my copy under my desk to finish the last 50 pages at work. I can't tell if I suspended my disbelief, or fully believed and drank the Kool-Aid, or some combination of both. All I can say is that this book seized hold of me and refused to let go, lured me and seduced me with Tartt's picturesque, poetic language and description, the sustained tension and ominous mood, and the intricacies of the dark, feral, brutal natures and impulses that lurk underneath beautiful, polished surfaces. I was compelled to savor the details, but also desperate to turn the pages and read more. I was by turns irritated, disgusted, sympathetic, contemplative of the relationships and actions and reactions of Henry, Bunny, Francis, Charles and Camilla, and though I wouldn't say any rank among the more memorable characters I've read, they ended up being as magnetic as Richard the narrator first found them to be, even if in the end I was repelled by them rather than attracted. I could not look away, I was completely captured and in their and Tartt's spell. And I came to satisfied and unsettled by my satisfaction, as though I shouldn't have liked or enjoyed or been so captivated by such a tale. This book is wicked. I can see how wicked can mean evil/unpleasant, or a New England style excellent for this read, and completely understand its polarizing nature. If you haven't read The Secret History yet and are debating about it, I'd recommend trying it if you're a fan of dense literary novels and don't always need a moral paragon to root for. And if you do decide to pick it up, I can only urge to try as hard as you can to suspend your disbelief and get caught in the web... I can't tell if I devoured it or it devoured me, or both, but either way I loved this wicked book. 4.5 stars rounded up to 5 stars, with a future re-read all but guaranteed....more",Notes are private!,0,279,1,"Jun 18, 2017","Jun 19, 2017","Oct 07, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/29044.The_Secret_History

And ultimately, I think that as a novel of ideas, concepts, exploration of how we as humans of various backgrounds understand and confront identity and immigration and race in the modern day, and a spotlight on the Nigerian and African diaspora in the US and UK, Americanah has much to recommend the reader, and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's intelligent observations and smart, incisive prose are by turns enlightening, heartbreaking, infuriating. But as a novel of narrative, it failed to convince me that its characters were anything more than constructs designed to elicit specific scenarios, conversations, actions that could provide a platform for Adichie's ideas and opinions. And because I didn't believe in or connect with Obinze or especially Ifemelu, I could not root for them, care about their love story since it seemed of far lesser importance and had correspondingly less meat and development. So I'd give this a solid 3 stars: I liked it, Adichie can clearly write very well, and there's so much in the way of intellectual stimulation and thought provoking content.

I didn't know quite what to expect from it, other than that Silence is thought of as a modern classic and it's a slim little volume (my PB is just over 200 pages).About half of the novel is told in an epistolary format through the letters of Sebastian Rodrigues, a Jesuit missionary to Japan in the 17th century and based on a historical figure named Giuseppe Chiara. We see through Rodrigues' eyes his arrival with his fellow priest Garrpe, their early efforts to minister to the Christians in hiding in the peasant villages, and wrestling with that fear of discovery. It is interesting to see in these early pages how Rodrigues is fighting with various notions of fear: as an educated Jesuit priest, he has heard tell of glorious martyrdom and in some ways openly embraces that fate for himself, but he is also caught off guard a bit by the fear that the samurai will uncover their missionary work and he and the Christian peasants will lose their lives. Rodrigues is also some ways put into a position of Christ with his own Japanese version of Judas, a fact which at first humbles him and gives him strength, but also later causes doubt, confusion and anger for his own feelings that differ from Christ's forgiveness and love for his betrayer. His faith begins to wobble a bit in the early parts, a prelude for the massive test before him in the end, and this wavering faith is visible many times but most notably as he watches three Christians bravely go to their deaths: They were martyred. But what a martyrdom! I had long read about martyrdom in the lives of saints - how the souls of the martyrs had gone home to Heaven, how they had been filled with glory in Paradise, how the angels had blown trumpets. This was the splendid martyrdom I had often seen in my dreams. But the martyrdom of the Japanese Christians I now describe to you was no such glorious thing. What a miserable and painful business it was! The rain falls unceasingly on the sea. And the sea which killed them surges on uncannily - in silence. The latter half pulls out of the perspective of Rodrigues and into third person as he is captured, interrogated, and tempted. Though we see much of the cruelty of the Japanese with their methods of torture and death against the peasants, a more insidious, effective punishment is devised for Rodrigues. He is put into conversation with the intelligent Inoue and an apostate former colleague, and together the words Rodrigues hears are the ones that truly brings his faith into question: should he apostatize to save the tortured Christian peasants, or maintain faith, communion, salvation and the love of God for himself. As put in a conversation with his former mentor: ""Laudate Etum! I engraved those letters on the wall,"" Ferreira repeated. ""Can't you find them? Look again!""""I know"" The priest, carried away by his anger, shouted louder than ever before. ""Keep quiet!"" he said. ""You have no right to speak like this.""""I have no right? That is certain. I have no right. Listening to those groans all night I was no longer able to give praise to the Lord. I did not apostatize because I was suspended in the pit. For three days, I who stand before you was hung in a pit of foul excrement, but I did not say a single word that might betray my God."" Ferreira raised a voice that was like a growl as he shouted: ""The reason I apostatized... are you ready? Listen! I was put in here and heard the voices of those people for whom God did nothing. God did not do a single thing. I prayed with all my strength; but God did nothing.""""Be quiet!""""Alright. Pray! But those Christians are partaking of a terrible suffering such as you cannot understand. From yesterday - in the future - now at this very moment. Why must they suffer like this? And while this goes on, you do nothing for them. And God - he does nothing either."" Silence as the title is fitting because the climax and Rodrigues' decision is all about the perceived silence of God in the face of Christians suffering, apostatizing, dying, and the silence Rodrigues longs for when he hears the words that serve to shake his position and force him to choose. Rodrigues has been trained and has believed in the power of God, but here in Japan, circumstance and machination in some ways force God out of the equation, and a single man (fluid between who has the power to choose, to act between Rodrigues and Inoue) is given all the power over life and death of others. Indeed throughout the novel we are treated to more and more references of silence, of quiet, of being alone and abandoned, as Rodrigues is increasingly under threat physically and spiritually and feels removed from God. Although in the end, I might argue, Ferreira's reasoning proves true and it is only because of Rodrigues' love of Christ and use of Christ as an exemplar that the priest is able to make the choice that he makes.Endo's prose (and its English translation) is quiet but powerful, sparse yet beautiful. There's little dialogue in the first half as we're immersed in Rodrigues' thoughts, though the exchanges in the second half help balance the work. I will say that writing is somewhat simple, not overly sophisticated, which works within the overall effects of the novel but can also sometimes be tedious with the repetition of description and metaphor. The whole of the work functions as a work of historical fiction bringing to life a tumultuous, bloody time in the history of Japan and history of Christianity in Japan. It also functions as a sort of long, fleshed out parable, of a man of God in the wilderness, confronted and tempted. I found Silence overall a thought provoking and meditative read, though its quiet style and unique subject matter means that while I would on the one hand recommend it to all readers for its universality, I probably wouldn't go out of my way to put it in the hand of anyone I know since matters of faith and how to wrestle with one's faith and the ideas of the mission and conversion and apostasy are deeply personal....more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,"Nov 02, 2016","Nov 13, 2016","Oct 07, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/25663949-silence

I picked up a free copy of Rebel of the Sands floating around my office, and figured it would be easy YA reading to crank through in a few hours. And I did, but it took more work and effort on my part than I expected. Overall, I felt it was just so bland, too much long travelogue with a budding romance that felt boring and passionless, a milquetoast heroine whose big reveal I guessed very early on, confused and weak overall worldbuilding, and a larger politically oriented plot setting the stage for sequels that lacked any real impact on the main characters and was not overly compelling or involving for me as the reader. I lived in the Middle East for three years as a teen and adult, so I was excited to see how Hamilton would utilize the mythology and rich cultural history of the region. And the western elements - the frontier feel, the gunslingers - also sounded neat. Unfortunately, the varying elements all felt borrowed, hastily used and discarded at random, and never quite congealed into something original or comprehensive, which made the larger framework of the world feel incomplete. I never felt immersed in any part of Miraji, which is pretty much a catastrophe for a fantasy series: if your reader is not immersed in your world or at least intrigued by it, you'll lose them on book one. And the magic of the book isn't well explained, nor are the characters, human fighters and Demdji (offspring of humans and djinn) good examples of how magic is used. I lacked interest or excitement or emotion while reading this, and ultimately had no attachment to the characters' struggles or motivations or special abilities: everything was just there and I read things and didn't care and moved on to the next plot point or magical reveal. My other problem is so many beats were so familiar, done to death, and not made new or fresh: girl who is outcast-ish, leaves home in search of new place, finds romance, shifting political realities, a big reveal about her family, discovery of her true capabilities, girl assumes role of some importance leading to set up of next book. And because none of the characters jumped off the page, all very flat and one dimensional and some little more than tropes, it seemed like Hamilton was just telling a same old, same old story, and was relying on this unique dry, lawless Western mashup with ancient Middle Eastern culture and mythology to carry the reader through. After some good YA reads for me this fall, including Caraval and The Gentleman's Guide to Vice and Virtue, plus a solid if unspectacular read with Heartless and a great literary oriented experience with The Book Thief, I suppose I was overdue for a strikeout. I like YA fantasy when it's well written and feels new and fresh, even if the concepts are familiar. And while I fully admit I picked Rebel of the Sands to read because I thought it would be a quick #48 on my path to hit 50 books by tomorrow, I had wanted to read it and the premise sounded interesting and then it won a Goodreads Choice Award. I went in open minded, if perhaps with slightly higher expectations based on my current YA appreciation streak. But this really didn't work for me, and I wouldn't recommend it. (I haven't read a lot of the other Western or Middle Eastern based YA fantasies yet to present an alternative, but if you are looking for something different and are intrigued by djinn, I highly recommend Jonathan Stroud's Bartimaeus trilogy - The Amulet of Samarkand, The Golem's Eye, and Ptolemy's Gate - something I loved as an adolescent and find still holds up well in terms of inventiveness, ingenuity, and overall excellence as an adult). I'd give Rebel of the Sands two stars, for aiming high and at least for being decently written, but the lack of cohesiveness and execution and action bored me, I will not be looking for future installments of this series, I'm happy I was able to get a copy for free and not have to pay for my disappointment, and I'm perplexed as to how this won for debut Goodreads author in the 2016 awards.

But the secondary and peripheral characters are all deeply and carefully brought to life, as compelling in their own right as the two leads. Though it sets up to where you think it will be a slowly unfolding, cross cultural love story with the backdrop of the Dutch trading post in Japan, Mitchell is far too inventive for that. Suddenly you're ensconced in horrifying cults and the subjugation of women and a skirmish with a British warship and the views of cowardice and heroism that unite and divide various members of the cast of characters.What stands out for me is the importance of language in the novel: translation, from Japanese to Dutch and back again, is front and center, as is word choice between characters. The scene where Kobayashi subtly threatens Jacob via a translation lesson is astounding in its genius and so well crafted. And the importance and love of language the characters hold, Mitchell holds as well. I found myself truly enjoying his prose, his ear for how language sounds coming out of character's mouths and in narrative flow, and dog-earing pages all over the book with phrases, sentences, ideas I most appreciate.I became misty eyed at the end, as I always do, not because the ending is particularly sad, but because it is both deeply satisfying, and also because while the novel is pretty much perfect from my perspective, I grew to love everything about the read so much, I would always want more....more",Notes are private!,-1,35,2,"Jun 19, 2020Oct 04, 2016","Jun 19, 2020Oct 06, 2016","Oct 04, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7141642-the-thousand-autumns-of-jacob-de-zoet

Focused on one young woman, Shelby Richmond, the novel has the feel of a comiI'm of two minds on Faithful, the first book I've read by Alice Hoffman. Focused on one young woman, Shelby Richmond, the novel has the feel of a coming of age tale, but is probably more accurately about how Shelby comes to terms with her guilt, her anger, and her self-pity that follow her through life after a car accident in which her friend is rendered brain dead. There's a lot in here, a short novel that is packed with ideas and symbolism and major plot points, and while Hoffman is a beautiful writer, not all of it works well and the craft of the plot felt uneven at times. But this book is exemplary at pulling on your heartstrings, and it pulled mine very effectively. So overall I'd give this 3.5 stars, and round up to 4. Feelings are best left concealed. They can bite you if you're not careful. They can eat you alive. We begin with Shelby as a teenager, in a state of frozen time, hiding in her parents basement and almost entirely disconnected from the world around her following the accident. We discover that directly following the accident, Shelby tried to commit suicide, leading to her hospitalization where her disconnect from reality is exacerbated by an orderly who rapes her repeatedly. These early parts are harsh and hard to read, though in some ways kind of glossed over by Hoffman and not dealt with as deeply as one might think. It does the trick of establishing Shelby's backstory, and giving cause for her blackened, fragile state.We move on as Shelby moves on into adulthood, and little slivers of light begin to penetrate and crack the cloud of depression and darkness. Her progress forward, her ability to come to terms with what happened and forgive herself are hampered by Shelby herself, setbacks here and there. She makes poor decisions, she pushes people she loves away, she is mean, cutting, oblivious and uncaring to the feelings of others. Yet we begin to root for her as she takes tentative steps forward, feels a calling for recognizing fellow battered and bruised creatures and rescuing quite a few animals along the way. She begins to uncoil, to open up again, slowly coming around to her own worth and value, and developing a life of meaning for herself. Some things that happen feel like they happen to Shelby (the promotion to manager of the pet store) but Hoffman does a pretty good job of showing Shelby slowly regaining control and power over her own life and destiny, nodded to cutely in the ongoing refusal to open fortune cookies, until the very end when she receives her most on the nose fortune: ""What is behind you is gone, what is in front of you awaits."" Love is a mystery. It's like an alien abduction. You think you're on earth, and there you are among the stars.  Shelby feels haunted by her own ragged emotions. Is this what love does to you? Makes you feel accountable for things you can't control?  ""He told me he wanted the chance to be in love again. He has no idea that being in love is bullshit. It's knowing someone down to their soul that matters. That's what love is. It's difficult and it's real and it doesn't change. I used these quotes, sprinkled throughout the novel, to show just how important love and self-love are for the characters in Faithful. Shelby's lack of love for herself has been touched on, but just as important is her relationship with her mother, one that is the most moving and the best drawn in the novel. Her mother begins as an irritant to Shelby, someone hovering over her and constantly worrying over her, and Shelby at that point in a fog of depression and self-pity cannot connect with her at all. By the novel's end, without spoiling anything, suffice it to say that Shelby understands and is awed by the depth of her mother's love, and their relationship is greatly strengthened, something that helps Shelby continue her climb out of her darkest place. The moment where Sue slaps Shelby in the car is powerful, and very well done by Hoffman. Shelby's relationship with her colleague Maravelle and her family and the deep love and loyalty that develops is also well drawn, and feels random and sudden and natural, as real life friendship is. Her relationships with Ben and James are perhaps the least compelling, especially the latter: even though I was fine with Shelby getting a happy ending, the introduction of James and his role threaded through the whole of the novel felt a bit too neat for me.You can never really remove yourself or your circumstances when writing a  of content: you approach a novel with your own perspective and history and taste. So while I responded well to Alice Hoffman's writing style, I felt Faithful sometimes meandered a bit too much. But I also read this just after Commonwealth and Moonglow where some major plot meanderings also happen but for me were executed better. That said, the emotional thrust of the book really worked for me, again, perhaps because I am in a specific point of my life where I can empathize greatly with Shelby's pain, sadness, and toxic combination of self-pity and self-disgust, and root for her to stop wallowing and enjoying living. So even while I had some issues with how the plot developed, I really love Hoffman's writing style, and the emotional impact was powerful. I would recommend this (with the caveat that there are trigger warning for readers sensitive to things like rape and self-harm) and I will absolutely read more from Hoffman in the future....more",Notes are private!,0,53,1,"Nov 14, 2016","Nov 20, 2016","Sep 06, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29430788-faithful

We only have one after all, we should try and do our best. We can never get it right, but we must try.” While I can understand the mixed reaction, and wouldn't call it a book for everyone, Life After Life is a beautifully written, acutely English, slow-burner of a novel, a beautiful piece of family drama and comedy, and a fantastic work of historical fiction. It's wrapped in a high-concept conceit of our protagonist Ursula's continual birth and rebirth into her not quite the same life, but said conceit is executed softly, subtly, played for laughs, used to display the horrors of war and the simple beauties of life. As such, it somewhat defies conventional subject categorization other than really well-done fiction. This book just clicked for me: the gorgeous prose, the unexpected and welcome humor, the depth of description of the Blitz and bucolic Fox Corner, the glorious (the dazzling and dueling Sylvie and Izzy especially) female characters of the Todd family (and their solid yet less interesting male family members), the constant literary references and the way major questions about life's meaning and importance are handled quietly, thoughtfully, artfully. While not a perfect novel, I was completely swept away by Life After Life and this is something I'll re-read in the future. Overall, I found so much humanity in this read, and it was so well-written, I couldn't help but be moved and informed and entertained by it. This is a novel that also rifled through my fears of my (and everyone's) mortality, yet also left a pervading sense of optimism, or at least perseverance in the face of the inevitable. I'd rate it 4.5 stars, but round up to 5 stars for the final feelings I had upon finishing it: contentment, satisfaction, and a light regret there wasn't more.

But I picI'm not typically a reader of YA from the modern era, though I've been known to re-read my favorite children's literature from my own youth. But I picked up The Book Thief a week ago on more or less a whim, knowing little about it other than it was a WWII novel set in Germany.This is definitely YA but can work for adults, and even though you know how it ends from the beginning (Death, the narrator, tips his hand to it explicitly throughout, and also because its a WWII novel set in Germany) I was compelled to care about the meandering progress of Liesel, Rudy, Hans and Max.I'm a fast reader, but this took me a week, mainly because it's the sort of book you chew, swirl, savor, and digest after each chapter. The writing style and imagery from the perspective of Death caught me off guard at first, and I needed a few chapters for it to feel familiar, but once immersed in the story, the style enhances the inexorable tragedy and love that wraps the characters together.The illustrations and mini stories within the stories (written/painted by the characters or otherwise) were simple, but really enhanced the importance of words, and the powerful sharing of those words and images, particularly between Liesel and Max.Overall, I was surprised how much I enjoyed The Book Thief. I do read adult historical fiction, and even with the YA slant and very different perspective/narration tactics, I find this novel stands up well to others I've read. I'm still savoring the overall impression I have from reading it, and I would re-read it, although likely not for a few years so it hasn't vaulted into my re-read anytime, instant classic group....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Sep 26, 2016","Oct 04, 2016","Sep 06, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/28789556-the-book-thief

Though I found the plot itself could have been a bit tighter and my attention would occasionally wane during some of the subplot portions, and it may not have engaged me as much emotionally as it did in spades intellectually, this is overall an absorbing, interesting read and is memorable for its striking protagonists, its authentic, haunting atmosphere and its gorgeous prose. I did alternate between savoring the writing and pushing forward to see what was slowly unfolding, which is a mark of a book that has captured me. It's probably 4.5 stars but rounded down to 4 stars as I really liked it and would recommend it but wasn't completely carried away with enthusiasm or affection for it as a whole. 'Sometimes I think I sold my soul, so that I could live as I must. Oh I don't mean without morals or conscience - I mean only with the freedom to think the thoughts that come, to send them where I want them to go, not to let them run along tracks someone else set, leading only this way or that...' Frowning, she ran her thumb along the serpent's spine and said, 'I've never said this before, not to anyone, though I've meant to: but yes, I've sold my soul, though I'm afraid it didn't fetch too high a price. I had faith, the sort I think you might be born with, but I've seen what it does and I traded it in. It's a sort of blindness, or a choice to be mad - to turn your back of everything new and wonderful - to see that there's no fewer miracles in the microscope than in the gospels!'Cora Seaborne is our protagonist, the above some her dialogue. At the opening of the novel, Cora is just entering widowhood, for her a very freeing, welcome change rather than be the thrall of an abusive husband, ""mounted on a plinth"" as she refers to her state. Cora has a sparkling wit, abundance of intellectual curiosity, an easy familiarity with her friends, and a depth of feeling and emotion surging forth, the dam of her husband's cruelty and isolation broken. While she has a dear companion, Martha, in whom she counts on for care of her odd, emotionally detached son Francis, and good friends like Dr Luke Garrett, ""the Imp"" a surgeon bold in ideas and actions and secretly in love with Cora, she is not connected to anyone by spirit and mind and body in a way that one recognizes a true friend, love, equal. And how else to account for the longing I have for you? Cora, I was content. I had come to the end of everything new - I had no more surprises in store, and I never sought any. I was serving my purpose. And there you were - and from your hair which is never tidy to your man's clothes, I've never liked the look of you (do you mind?). But I seem to have learned you by heart, seemed at once to know you, had immediate liberty to say everything to you I could never have said elsewhere - and all this is to me the 'substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen'! Ought I to be ashamed, or troubled? I am not. I refuse to be.How do you like that, you rank atheist, you apostate? You have driven me to God. Enter Will Ransome, the Rector of Aldwinter Parish, a keen intellect and a deep faith in an Enlightenment influenced version of God. With his regular flock of Essex folk and his family - beautiful, vivacious but frail wife Stella, driven and intelligent daughter Joanna and two young sons - Will has a full load and world already. But Cora's arrival in Aldwinter, coupled with the resurgence of the mysterious Essex Serpent, a near mythical beast rumored to be responsible for some strange deaths and calamitous events and moods in the area, explodes Will's small world. His conversations with Cora and their interactions with others in Essex and London mirror larger forces contrasting and colliding in the late Victorian era: science and religion, faith and doubt, even the old schemes of aristocracy and lower classes being confronted with a demand for upward mobility and decency from the lower classes. We see the main characters forced to reckon with these shifts in collective understanding and being able to hold seemingly opposed ideas at once, all the while trying to enjoy, understand, then repress the increasing depths of their affection for each other.I won't spoil more about the plot itself, since it is all very well wound together. Perry does a nice job tying her various subplots together, though I didn't care for all of them with equal weight - more time with Stella and her deteriorating condition would have been welcome, as well as more time with Garrett and Spencer and their adventures on the fringes of new medicine, while perhaps less time with Martha's socialist views and plight of the worker and unusual romantic relationship. But overall the characters spark off one another and move the whole inexorably forward, and Perry's sense of place and especially time are extremely detailed and beautifully rendered. For those who like a character focused, questioning novel, this work of historical fiction is likely for you: a bit slow moving plot wise, but the intellect and emotions of our characters keep things humming along and eager to learn what's next, while the atmospheric prose entertains and paints the scene with turns of phrase to savor. I didn't fall in love with this book emotionally, but I was stimulated by and appreciated so many of its elements and ultimately the sum of its parts....more",Notes are private!,0,78,1,"Dec 12, 2016","Dec 17, 2016","Sep 06, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/26225360-the-essex-serpent

Overall, I was completely won over by the end of Hag-Seed, the emotion and intelligence of her re-imaging of the plot of The Tempest. I'd ultimately give it 4.5 stars, but I'd go up to 5 stars because of how heartily I enjoyed it on the whole. I would say if you're a Margaret Atwood fan of her speculative fiction, this may not be a slam dunk for you, but if you're a fan of Shakespeare, run, don't walk, for this great take that celebrates and amplifies the play, while also revealing the great literary talent of the author.Felix Phillips is our protagonist and stand in Prospero, a once beloved Artistic Director of the Makeshiweg Theatre Festival, usurped and ousted by schemers looking for a catapult to greater professional and political heights. The narrative is more or less straightforward and mirrors the original in that Felix/Prospero is self-exiled to a shack in the woods and reduced to teaching English by way of Shakespeare to minimum security prisoners, and as his new life is set on a path to collide with the antagonists, he plots vengeance upon them.What is brilliant is the actual use of the play on a few levels, by the characters and by Atwood. Felix's great regret is his unceremonious sacking before he could stage his own version of The Tempest at the Festival, an elaborate version of depth and feeling. After years of his program at the prison running through Julius Caesar, Macbeth, Richard III and other works, he resurrects his own Tempest version to be read, discussed, and staged with the inmates. The play comes to fruition, but not without a play within a play, in which his enemies unknowingly fill roles in the production that Atwood has them assuming in the narrative. In fact, almost every character fills a dual role, one in the narrative, one in the production, and in most cases the roles are the same: Felix is Prospero in both, while two characters share the role of Ferdinand (though only one gets the girl). And of course, Felix has self-exiled, and the inmates who are the players are also the original ""inhabitants"" of the island that is Fletcher, a literal prison, that Felix/Prospero comes to rule and brings his enemies to in his plot of vengeance. Felix's magic is his humanity, his presentation, and his ability to share his love of Shakespeare, and he's able to entrance/control/ally with the inmates/players just as Prospero tames Ariel and Caliban to his will. Not that the inmates are unaware: there's a reason that so many want to be Caliban during the casting process.The importance of words comes across as a central theme, their power, the access they provide, how they reveal characters and propel plot. And Atwood has fun with the language of Shakespeare: the inmates/players are not allowed to curse in Felix's class other than the oaths from within the source material, so poxy whoresons and hag-seeds abound:' ""Caliban should be First Nations,"" says Red Coyote. ""It's obvious. Got his land stole.""""No way,"" says PPod. ""He's African. Where's Algiers anyway? North Africa, right? That's where his mother came from. Look on the map, pox brain.""""So, he's a Muslim? I don't whoreson think so."" VaMoose, another Caliban aspirant.""No way that he's smelly-fish white trash, anyways,"" says Shiv, glaring at Leggs. ""Even part white.""""I score,"" says Leggs. ""You heard the man, fen head, it's final. So suck it.""""Points off, you swore,"" says PPod.""Suck it's not a swear word,"" says Leggs. ""It's only a diss. Everyone knows that, and the devil take your fingers!""Anne-Marie laughs. ' Atwood's own considerable talents as a writer are also on display, with smartly observed passages from Felix's perspective like:What to do with such a sorrow? It was like an enormous black cloud boiling up over the horizon. No: it was like a blizzard. No: it was like nothing he could put into language. He couldn't face it head on. He had to transform it, or at the very least enclose it.By choosing this shack and the privations that would come with it, he would of course be sulking. He'd be hair-shirting himself, playing the flagellant, the hermit. Watch me suffer. He recognized his own act, an act with no audience but himself. It was childish, this self-willed moping. He was not being grown up.The master stroke for me was Atwood's use of Miranda, both within Felix's production and within the larger framework of the narrative. Felix had a daughter, Miranda, who died at an early age. Into his exile, he imagines Miranda restored to him and growing into the young woman she never had a chance to be. In his production, he casts the promising dancer-actress he had cast years ago for his aborted Tempest for the Festival, and his relationships with both his Mirandas inform a lot about Felix's character, and provide a great deal of the heart of the novel.Ultimately, just as Prospero, having enacted revenge and received a mostly happy ending in The Tempest, begs for the audience to forgive him, so too does Felix similarly need forgiveness and freeing from the chains that had bound him and had pushed him to act. The ideas of redemption and forgiveness are certainly present, and Atwood subtly reinforces them with the prison based setting but neither she nor Felix are overt with comparisons, which is helpful. The re-imagined, alternate endings the inmates/players provide from the perspective of each character are also wonderfully revealing about their own perspectives serving time, seeking a possible future.Felix explains 'I have respect for talent: the talent that would otherwise lie hidden, and that has the power to call forth light and being from darkness and chaos.' Margaret Atwood has proven with Hag-Seed that she has the highest level of talent, and while her work doesn't emerge from darkness and indeed has a splendid source material, she shows great respect for Shakespeare's work while entirely making it her own. A great read!...more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"Oct 08, 2016","Oct 11, 2016","Sep 06, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29245653-hag-seed

I started and stopped in fits, but one massive read in a single sitting was the way for me to go on this, allowing it to crash and wash over me completely, and get acquainted with the style and be fully receptive to the ideas expressed here. Once submerged in the unique format, I was incredibly moved by the way Saunders is able to link the singular sadness and pain of one man losing his son (one great, historically critical man) to the comings and goings and suffering and salvation of all. This read was a force of nature for me: random, unexpected, bold, brilliant. It was unable to be fully pinned down into thought or analysis by me, but so easily appreciated and awed by its power and beauty. A full 5 stars for me, and likely to be my favorite read of the month (if not the year), as it's continued to haunt me since finishing it.  All were in sorrow, or had been, or soon would be. It was the nature of things. Though on the surface it seemed every person was different, this was not true. At the core of each lay suffering; our eventual end, the many losses we must experience on the way to that end. We must try to see one another in this way. As suffering, limited beings - perennially outmatched by circumstance, inadequately endowed with compensatory graces. The particulars are a matter of historical record and the book blurb: eleven-year-old Willie Lincoln has passed away and been laid to rest in February 1862, and amidst turmoil and war and death of the increasingly bloody Civil War, his father, President Abraham Lincoln, visits Willie's tomb and spends a night with his son's body. The novel focuses on that one night, as Willie's spirit is in the bardo (the space between life and death, lingering between states of reality). We're given a historical and cultural context and contemporary views of Lincoln, his family, and his performance as President and as a father to help us better understand his guilt, his loss, his suffering and his strength on that evening via a selection of quotes from actual biographical sources and those Saunders has imagined and created to better strengthen his portrait of the President in 1862. Fact and fiction weave together to display a complex view of Lincoln, compounded by getting into the President's mental space as he holds his son's corpse in the tomb. All over now. He is either in joy or nothingness. (So why grieve? The worst of it, for him, is over.) Because I loved him so and am in the habit of loving him and that love must take the form of fussy and worry and doing. Only there is nothing left to do.  Willie is not in the bardo alone: a veritable Greek chorus of spirits accompanies him, urge him to move on while simultaneously rejecting their own status of death and clinging to the beauty, large and small, of life. It's this Greek chorus that helps round out the universality of Saunders' novel: Willie as one soul among many, all important, all meaningful, all moving toward the same fate and state. But the spirits are also individuals, even if they say similar things: each has their past and their death, a manner of speaking and a way of dealing with their bardo state. There's humor and introspection, ribald pronouncements and dark truths, trite obsessions and larger worries that come to the forefront with this group of spirits from backgrounds rich and poor, black and white, the array of personalities and issues in death as varied and interesting as in life. Those in the bardo must decide on this evening who is to ascend to the next state and leave behind their ties to their earthly existences, and who shall remain, and many look to Willie and his father as a means to connect with their own loved ones, while others take pains to help Willie move on, and Lincoln to be at peace with the loss of his son (and the deaths of the young men and boys on the battlefield, of Union and Confederate forces alike, and the captivity and dehumanization and death of the American slaves that also weigh on his conscience). He was an open book. An opening book. That had just been opened up somewhat wider. By sorrow. And-by us....Taken! One is thunderstruck that such a brutal violation has occurred in what had previously seemed a benevolent world. From nothingness, there arose great love; now, its source nullified, that love, searching and sick, converts to the most abysmal suffering imaginable.  This is a novel that really brilliantly weaves the details of Lincoln's life in 1862 and specific pain of the loss of his young son, with larger themes connected to all humankind, past present and future, of our particular and universal fate, the horrible and yet beautiful ""trap"" of life and death, death's inevitability and unpredictability, and the glorious nature of love and pleasure and beauty and peace that a human life can contain is both tainted and yet more deeply beloved for that simple fact.  You are a wave that has crashed upon the shore, repeat visions that implore souls in the bardo to move forward. And so too has Saunders' novel utterly crashed upon me, a brilliant, breathtaking meditation on the human experience: grief, life, death, and all in between. A hypnotic, powerful, entirely memorable read that I recommend to any and all who live and love and lose, as we all do.-received an e-galley on edelweiss, thanks to Random House...more",Notes are private!,0,205,1,"Dec 31, 2016","Jan 07, 2017","Sep 06, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29906980-lincoln-in-the-bardo

And even if you believe something is for you, the book still needs to reveal and unfold and delight and surprise and strike emotional chords and climax and conclude to your satisfaction by its end, all while also possessing a writing style you respond to or at least does not detract from your enjoyment. So its sometimes a wonder we like any books at all when the stakes and standards are set so high. And Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell does not go out of its way to recommend itself to a new, uninitiated reader: its length both actual and perceived can certainly intimidate and inspire dread, the vast peppering of footnotes can be wearying, and the hybrid nature of its style and genre - an alternate history fantasy of early 19th century England written in a Dickensian-Austenian manner that is self-aware and sly, touching on style points like the Gothic and romantic novel and the Byronic hero, and plot points like war with Napoleon, Lord Byron, North-South England divides, the madness of King George III, relations between servants and their masters. Add to this of course magic, magic of a nebulous and free variety, no hard and fast system, not lots of smoke (though many mirrors), nothing too showy or special, a magic of an earthy, grounded, but still foreign, complicated, dangerous variety, complete with an entire history of magic in England from the 12th century and a whole host of anecdotes and tales and figures from said history that inform the present ideas, intentions and actions. All of these disparate forces and ideas and characters and influences joined together in one place, and meant to be read as one complete work, of over a thousand pages (in my edition, and perhaps understated considering there are two and three page footnotes worked in as well)? This truly is not a book for everyone.But if you read and were intrigued by my sprawling summary, and like reading things in a 19th century style or pastiche, and enjoy fantasy but don't need it to be as obvious or clear cut as modern fantasy novels typically show it, if you think it might be for you and are ready to commit to the novel's length and slow unfolding and building of events and ideas, then I wholeheartedly encourage you to pick up a paper copy, not least because the sheer number of footnotes would be highly aggravating to read in an e version, and settle yourself into bed or a large armchair or your sofa and begin.Because if Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell isn't for you, you'll be irritated or wearied by it and put it aside. But if it is for you, like it is for me, it is likely to vault amongst your most favorite, beloved books, something to re-read again and again, an old, familiar friend to turn to when new reads aren't hitting the mark as near as you'd like, and yet because of its depth and richness and length and detail, you'll find something new that strikes you every time. When this book is for you, despite my version ending on page 1006, I still crave more. More of charming and arrogant and a bit absent minded but intelligent Strange (though perhaps a bit less of the Norrell of most of the book but I am a biased Strangeite, I admit), more of Arabella, more of her fascinating anti-hero of Childermass, more of the soft Mr Segundus, more appearances of Lord Wellington (whose portrayal seems both accurate and inspired), more Stephen Black and much, much more of the Raven King and the magic of England. And I love Susanna Clarke's style, and her all-knowing narrator is filled with dry wit and humor in describing events and characters. For me the writing pulls the entire ambitious thing together, its craft and execution as important as the characters and plot for me.I know that most books you won't know until you read them if they are or aren't for you. And sometimes a book is not for you at one time, but then later is, or vice versa. But I have loved this book for over a decade, from my first, somewhat challenged read of it in 2004 when it was first published as a teenager, to now, and this is truly not a book I love from nostalgia, but for itself. I wouldn't even say it holds up well: even though I don't believe it to be perfect, I read it and am enthralled and amused and delighted and pensive every time, and though I do read it in a new light each time, I am always swept away by it. I probably read this once a year and have done so since it was first published, and can't see any reason why that would change in the future.I dearly hope Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell is for you. If you think it may not be, or start it and don't quite connect, let it pass: it is too long and coiled and difficult to pin down to waste time or effort on it if you don't like it. If you read the whole thing and don't like it, I would love to hear your feedback. But if you've read it and know it's for you, then I'm so glad someone else loves this strange, unique, fantastic yet sober tale. And if you haven't yet read it but you think this may be for you, then I'm overjoyed and somewhat envious that you can encounter and discover this novel and its world for the first time....more",Notes are private!,0,79,2,"Feb 20, 2017not set","Feb 24, 2017not set","Sep 06, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/823763.Jonathan_Strange_Mr_Norrell

A truth was being revealed to me: that I had always tried to attach myself to the light of other people, that I never had any light of my own. I experienced myself as a kind of shadow.""This quote from Zadie Smith's Swing Time is very early in the novel, and for me calls out the difficult choices and construction that led me to give the work a 3.5 star , with a round down to 3 stars. Her prose is excellent, some of her characters very compelling, and she finds creative ways to explore differences and nuances and make observations on race, class, education, and worldview, with her cast of characters interacting and colliding, speaking and not speaking to reveal these ideas and truths. But our guide to this world and this story, the narrator, is very flat, boring, and from child to adult is more or less the same, experiencing little personal growth. And the jumping around through time, instead of following in a linear fashion the narrator's experience, seems like a construction for its own sake but it hinders rather than helps the narrative.Let's start with what works: the writing itself is beautiful. Mostly soft, slow, calming prose, but with deft observations and little twists of phrase to keep you going. Her grasp of the power complexities of relationships is great, and she shows us the various ways these power imbalances express themselves in many of the key relationships between the characters: narrator/Tracey, Aimee/everyone, narrator/mother, narrator mother/narrator father, and the list goes on. The narrator's mother and Tracey in particular are very well drawn, compelling, forces of nature that captivate and hold the narrator's attention (and ours). And the representation of race and class and education level across the board is extremely varied and presented with some sharp, smart ideas, revealed by the narrator and other characters mainly via their interactions rather than direct quotes. Smith is clearly a talented writer.And now what didn't work as well for me: the narrator. That first quote really encapsulates my issues with her, she is far less compelling and memorable than many of the other characters she interacts with, and her journey from childhood to adulthood, with all the trials and tribulations she and family and friends endure, doesn't result in any real character growth or awareness or anything. She's a shadow, a cipher, with flashes of real feeling and personality but too often a cardboard cutout to observe into other characters' lives. And maybe that was Smith's point in making her the narrator, but it can lead to a somewhat stifled, irritating read.The other main issue was the time jumping, and divide of experiences between childhood/focus on Tracey and adulthood/focus on Aimee. Tracey and Aimee are the two bodies the narrator orbits around, with characters like her formidable mother bridging the gap. With Tracey, we get school and much of the dance and early family dynamics; with Aimee it's adult relationship turmoil and celebrity culture and white (and mixed) do-gooders in Africa; for both Smith's commentary on race and class follow. The main problem is that the Tracey parts are far more interesting than the Aimee parts on the whole. Tracey herself is magnetic: spoiled, broken, talented, cruel, petty... just as the narrator can't look away from Tracey when she is on stage dancing, it's hard to tear away from Tracey when she's present on the page. And the accompanying observations and distinctions made, between Tracey's mother and narrator's mother, the role of fathers (one white, one black), the class and education intersections, are light, smart, fascinating. By contrast, some of the Aimee parts are plain boring. There's interesting commentary and observations, sure, when they are setting up the school. But you're never as in tune with the personalities and interactions of Hawa, Aimee, Fern, and Lamin as you are with the narrator's family and Tracey's family. And some of the observations lack as subtle a touch when it comes to undermining perceived know-better and privilege. And so, find myself interested in/caring for half the characters, and somewhat bored by the narrator, it could make some chapters feel very slow and I got bogged down more easily than I thought I would, though others would fly by.I suppose I went into this book expecting more, and was mildly disappointed.

All my life, everything I tried, I only got halfway there. You try to take advantage of the time you have. That's what they tell you to do. But when you're old, you look back and you see all you did with all that time is waste it. All you have is a story of things you never started or couldn't finish. Things you fought with all your heart to build that didn't last or fought with all your heart to get rid of and they're all still around. I'm ashamed of myself.""""I'm not ashamed of you,"" I said. ""I'm proud of you.""...""Anyway, it's a pretty good story,"" I said. ""You have to admit."" Moonglow is a pretty good story by Michael Chabon, a novel cum fictionalized memoir centered on Chabon's maternal grandfather but in many ways a multigenerational family portrait. I've read two of Chabon's books prior to Moonglow: his children's baseball fantasy book Summerland that I found endearing and with great storytelling and imagination (but lost me on some of the baseball bits) and The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay, one of my all time favorite books that I try to re-read every year or so. So I was expecting to enjoy Moonglow, but I was not expecting to be as enchanted as I was with this read, and formally usher Chabon into my list of favorite writers.There are so many things I loved about Moonglow. One is how tightly wound and cohesive Chabon's narrative ultimately proves to be, when from the outset it looks like a series of anecdotes and episodes in the life of his grandfather, grandmother, mother, or other family member. But Chabon's masterful storytelling means that all of the stories have a purpose in the larger whole, and something once introduced usually reappears in a new or interesting way, and whether or not it's impactful on the whole, there are no hanging details left unresolved. Early in the narrative, in the final years of Chabon's grandfather's life, we're introduced to his quest to kill the alligator or snake that ate Ramon, a cat belonging to the deceased husband of Sally. It's a perfect meet-cute and meet-quirk of a scene, in which Sally and the grandfather interact, form opinions and revise them and revise again, and eventually leads to the grandfather beginning a relationship with Sally and embarking on the mission to find and kill the alligator/snake. Nearing the end of the book, that dangling detail comes back full circle: when Sally and the grandfather are out looking for the dastardly reptile, in the midst of a declaration of love, Ramon himself appears, bloody and blackened and fat from eating what was imagined to be his killer. If a small moment like this is properly and charmingly revisited and concluded, if differently from how the reader may have thought things would turn out, Chabon has it mastered with the larger set pieces and major themes: his grandmother's mysterious past and demons that torment her; his grandfather's love of rockets through the years; his grandfather's strong but occasionally tenyous relationship with Chabon's mother who is not his biological child.Chabon's grandfather gets the lion's share of the attention, and he is a marvelous character and sounds as though he was also a pretty amazing man. It opens with a fantastic little moment of Chabon's grandfather basically going postal on the president of a company that just fired him: he was chosen since they felt he'd be unlikely to make any trouble, and Chabon uses this to show the reader just how wrong that idea is, and just how many levels, how many lives his grandfather has. From the streets of Philadelphia to WWII secret missions, to prison radios and rocket building to NASA model making, Chabon's grandfather wears many hats but is always devoted to his wife, increasingly troubled and unstable, and his daughter, Chabon's mother. The relationship between Chabon and his grandfather is also so well drawn, as they interrupt the storytelling to bring nonsequitors and related questions up, and we see the love between them and the family similarities, but also evidence of the generational gap and distance too of growing up in very different eras and with different guiding sensibilities. There's something somewhat Princess Bride-y in it, which adds to its charm: Chabon and his grandfather switch off narrating events (and his grandmother and mother do as well, as does Sally later on), and then there's the commentary within the story on the events or the telling of those events. Chabon's writing is, to my taste, great: revealing, smart, light. He wields metaphor and culture and history deftly, and though he can write overlong in some passages that can slow down one's interest (sometimes on the details of the rockets I found myself wanting to hurry through), most of the time you're effortlessly carried through on the strength of the narrative, the characters, and the humor. Oh the humor in Moonglow! God I found this funny, laughing out loud in parts, appreciate chuckles in others, devouring scenes with big wide smiles. Taste is subjective of course, and not everyone has the same sense or appreciation for humor, but I loved reading Moonglow and a lot had to do with just how much fun it was to read. There's a part in which the grandfather and Chabon's mother go to visit the grandmother in the hospital, where a play is about to be performed, and a female caretaker introduces them to the author of the play: ""How are you?"" Mrs Outcault said very loudly.Mr. Casamonaca nodded genially and made a looping benedictory gesture in the air, just in front of his face, more ornate than a cross, as if he were a priest in a sect whose symbol was the holy coat hanger of God.""Sign language,"" Mrs. Outcault explained. ""Poor thing's deaf as a boot. I heard he was struck by lightning, though I can't say for sure.""With his long pallid fingers and his nails manicured to a moonlike luster, Mr. Casamonaca continued to draw things across the space between him and my mother. The regular rippling of a corrugated roof. The outline of a jellyfish. The downward spiral of water in a toilet bowl.Mrs. Outcault nodded emphatically. ""Oh yes,"" she said. ""I know. You're so right.""""What's he saying?""""I have no idea,"" Mrs. Outcault said through a tight smile. She kept on nodding. ""It isn't real sign language at all. Just something he made up. He never learned to speak English very well, and in the past few years he's lost the ability to read and write in Italian.""""He - Then how did he write a play?""""He dictated it to your mother, which is why she has been so involved in all this. Using those crazy signs of his.""""My mom doesn't know sign language.""""Apparently, she is fluent in Mr. Casamonaca's.""My mother watched Mr. Casamonaca's hands and fingers explain the behavior of skyrockets, the opening of a beer can, and the proper means for setting a golf ball on a tee.""It looks like he's just making it up as he goes along,"" she said.""That is a popular theory,"" said Mrs. Outcault. There is so much life in Moonglow: a novel with the trappings of memoir that wraps in the lives of Chabon's grandfather, grandmother, mother, and even himself in parts. The humor, the struggles, the desperation, the guilt, the Jewish culture, the bonds of blood... all here and all executed brilliantly and woven into the fabric of the larger whole. The family is so well drawn (coming from real people, I suppose it was both easier and harder to do) and the narrative strong, the moments from life well chosen to entertain and to better flesh out into a story of a family. I really liked this book, and while parts did feel like they could have been edited a bit tighter to not slow the reader's pace/enjoyment, this family saga gets 4.5 enthusiastic stars from me, rounded up for the fantastic writing and sheer fun.""Everything you've been telling me is true, though, right?""""Well, it's all the way I remember it happening,"" he said. ""Beyond that I make no guarantees.""...more",Notes are private!,0,67,1,"Nov 14, 2016","Nov 19, 2016","Sep 06, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/26795307-moonglow

Eleven year old Anna O'Donnell has not eaten in four months: is it a hoax? Is Anna crazy or ill? Is she being pressured into this denial of food, or is it the faithful choice of a true believer? We see things from a third person limited perspective, focused on Lib. Her skeptical, scientific mind provides a solid point of entry for the reader, as she and we grapple with the character of Anna and her family members, and the larger motivations and implications of how various villagers, visitors and close friends and family view and engage with Anna's ""miracle"".The book works so well because the narration and writing are absolutely fine. Donoghue's quiet prose picks up sharply as we enter Lib's mind and thoughts, and the overall tone vacillates between skepticism and belief, between heavenly grace and willful, sinful lies and deceit. As Lib begins her watch over Anna, the reader also changes their interest with Lib, from a detached observer interested in the truth of the matter, to one who cares desperately for the outcome of Anna's fate, truth and consequences be damned. Lib's intelligence, strength, and deep feeling propelled me forward; Anna's mix of confidence and faith with naive innocence initially plays as hard to believe, but Donoghue allows the reader to see other hints of a fuller picture of the girl, and that invests you in her survival and in the relationship between her and Lib.I won't spoil the end, but while it is happy in a sense, I felt there wasn't a fully satisfying payoff to the tension that had been building throughout. And while I enjoy a happy ending most times, I suppose I may have expected something a touch more bittersweet and less nice and neat. But all in all, a very enjoyable read. It surprised me how much I enjoyed it: I started reading it around 6 PM and in between varying activities at home I was so drawn I had to finish it before bed.I'll have to try Donoghue's Room next: I saw the film which I liked a lot and thought the lead child actor and actress were both phenomenal, but would love to read more of Donoghue's work....more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,"Oct 10, 2016","Oct 10, 2016","Sep 06, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28449257-the-wonder

I've had a good run with Ann Patchett: I read Bel Canto long ago and liked it, and read State of Wonder earlier this month and enjoyed that as well. So I was very excited for the release of Commonwealth, and once I cleared my slate eagerly dove in. Overall, I found it a quick read, easy to engage with, funny in a light, deft way and also in a laugh out loud way, and speaking to really universal ideas about how families form, break, reform; defined, destroyed, redefined. Patchett's prose, as you might expect, is gorgeous, neat, and sharply observed, but I love how light her hand is here, especially when comparing it to the claustrophobic, tense atmosphere she created in State of Wonder. She's really one of the more skillful writers I've read in terms of wielding various forms of her distinct style to work with the plot, tone, and characters of a given story.Two locations are the main settings - Virginia and Los Angeles. Two families are the focus of the novel - the Keatings and Cousins - and their fusion and dysfunction are captured over decades, stemming from two key events: a christening for young Franny Keating in which the beginning of the affair between Bert and Beverly sparks, and (view spoiler)[ the death of the oldest Cousin's child, Cal, and the fallout for the children and parents over time (hide spoiler)]. Not all of the family members are entirely likable, and Patchett definitely presents with winning humor and sympathy the children's hatred and apathy toward Bert and Beverly as their lives are upended and somewhat haphazardly fused to one, not very Brady Bunch mixed family. The writing describing their summers together in Virginia is some of the book's best: the very differently expressed anger of Cal and Caroline, the zany, inexhaustible irreverence of Albie, Franny's sensitivity and Jeanette's withdrawal from the world and Holly's perfection and attention to detail, all are thoughtfully rendered and hilariously observed (especially in the case of Albie) in a single scene in which Beverly encounters each of the children in the house and ultimately longs to escape them all.The characters we spend the most time with and get acquainted with best are Fix and Franny. Fix is easily one of the best characters in Commonwealth, and one the reader is almost immediately on the side of since he's the left behind Los Angeles cop ex-husband of Beverly, but never loses his humor or his devotion to his daughters, and even aged and terminally ill, a man of sharp instincts and smart observations. Franny is a bit more of a cipher, and I never really got a fix on her character even though we follow her fairly closely and its her relationship with the author Leon ""Leo"" Posen that unites her blended family's past, present, and future, as this author mines the story of the affair and (view spoiler)[ Cal's death  (hide spoiler)] for a bestselling novel that turns into at the end, a brand new movie. Albie is probably the next best covered, a scene-stealer of a child who becomes a somewhat delinquent juvenile to a quiet and solitary but caring adult.I wish we had had more of Cal and Caroline to show us more of the angry older Cousin and Keating children and their progression. Bert was not really likable except for a good scene with Franny near the conclusion, and Patchett gave us just enough of him to understand the source of the Cousin children's anger especially. Teresa was well drawn, and really evolved beyond what we first see of her from Bert's perspective: I loved the movie to hospital sequence with her, Caroline, Franny and Fix near the end. Beverly also remained somewhat enigmatic to me, but we did get a good view of her beauty and sophistication masking a restlessness and discomfort with her own life choices, which seems to follow her through her string of failed marriages and awkward relationships with her children and stepchildren.Ultimately, it is beautiful prose creating a portrait of two families across time, smart, funny, and occasionally sad. I heartily recommend this to fans of Anne Patchett and fans of contemporary fiction in general. ...more",Notes are private!,0,50,1,"Nov 14, 2016","Nov 16, 2016","Sep 06, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28214365-commonwealth

The terrifying dehumanization and brutality of being sold into and living in bondage for blacks is presented and contrasted against the pursuit of freedom, often equally terrifying, dehumanizing, and brutal, and on protagonist Cora's journey on the literal Underground Railroad, she and we are carried to one dream deferred and lurking threat of death after another. But these calamities transcend the historical era: her experiences in South Carolina recall the Tuskegee experiments of the 1930s; the lynchings and purging of slaves and free blacks in North Carolina bring to mind segregation and the Jim Crow era in total; the disregard for the personhood of black people by major white characters like Ridgeway and Randall and the casual, banal evil perpetrated upon ""property"" feels like it echoes in the current era's divisive questioning about how much black lives really do matter. This book reaches into the past while simultaneously being entirely in the present, which is no small feat.So after all that praise, why only 3 stars?This is the second novel I read in February (along with Americanah) in which the intellectual ideas and concepts discussed and pondered are stronger than the narrative itself. In The Underground Railroad, I think Whitehead created compelling snapshots of life on a Georgia plantation, had some inventive and imaginative renderings of different black experiences across slave and free states, and had some great prose and passages bringing to life these overwhelmingly horrible actions and outcomes for his protagonist. But it was a bit too cerebral for what this subject matter needed in my opinion: I wanted to be emotionally connected to Cora, her journey, her misfortunes, her fears. And yet there's a distance that Whitehead keeps between the reader and Cora, something that becomes more apparent as the novel progresses, which is just when I wanted to draw closer and though I didn't want to think less, I wanted to feel more. I'll also admit that because I read this novel a bit late in the game, after all the acclaim and Oprah and winning the National Book Award, I was really expecting great things from The Underground Railroad. And for me, this delivered intellectually, but missed the mark emotionally, and ultimately did not quite live up to the hype though I did recognize its relevance, importance, and value to the discourse about the past, present, and future of race relations in the United States. I rate this at 3.5 stars, but rounded down because while I liked it, I was unable to fully connect to the narrative. I'd definitely recommend it for its importance, and it's an extremely accessible book about slavery that does manage to seem somewhat new and fresh while portraying and preserving the gruesome and despicable realities of the period (though I'm not as admiring about the ""originality"" or ""ingenuity"" of making the Underground Railroad a literal train; most schoolchildren first conceptualize it that way and some adults have famously continued to think a real locomotive brought blacks to freedom). But I might also recommend re-calibrating assumptions if you haven't read it, and try to tune out the hype and go in with neutral expectation: I went in sky high fully anticipating a 5 star experience, and while I was intellectually stimulated, my heart was untouched, and I was in the end just a bit let down and disappointed though I appreciated the read. It's a minority opinion for sure, and I'm glad this book exists and has been so widely read, but I simply expected and wanted more from it....more",Notes are private!,0,75,1,"Feb 08, 2017","Feb 12, 2017","Sep 06, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30555488-the-underground-railroad

The Historian is a long winded slog that is a terrible mysteUpon rereading this, I took a star away, as for me this truly warrants a one star . The Historian is a long winded slog that is a terrible mystery/vampire novel, a decent travelogue of 1970s Eastern Europe, and borrows the method of Dracula without nearing any of that book's execution. I'm into long winded tales, I'm into books set in the past, I'm into books about books, and characters as scholars or playing at scholars: Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell is one of my all time favorite books, and if I'm after a ""smart"" guilty pleasure I'll still enjoy picking up The Club Dumas. So this should totally be in my wheelhouse, but it was honestly even more of a chore the second time around.First the good: Kostova did a lot of research and travel to the places in her novel and it shows. The sense of place as we hop round Europe is quite good, especially with regard to Istanbul, Budapest, and Romania. Kostova has nice attention to detail for the travelogue oriented parts, and here, that detail is necessary, lends itself to establishing atmosphere and scene, and is altogether welcome and accomplished.That's all I've got for the good. Now for the frustrating, infuriating, weak and downright dull parts.First problem: the first narrator is entirely pointless. She has no personality to speak of, and has very little page time. Her entire reason for being is to ask her father questions, and then read from his series of letters. She has a few moments of action near the end but she herself does nothing in those moments. You care nothing about her, indeed you almost forget she exists, how little she is seen or heard versus the letters/conversations of her father, and because Kostova pretty much has one voice for all of the characters, she is entirely unmemorable. This leads to another two part downfall of the book: switching between multiple pasts with little payoff, and poorly using an epistolary format throughout. Because the first narrator is more or less pointless, the entire timeline of her past (because she is writing from the present to describe her past encounter that mostly describes her father's past) means very little to the reader. The portion that we care to read is Paul's past, his research and journeys and trials and tribulations shared with Helen. Paul and especially Helen are far more compelling characters. The third last we get is Rossi's, which informs Paul and Helen in their past as they piece together clues and facts. I could deal with this, but the problem is we are supposed to be gathering all this through letters that Paul has provided his nameless daughter. But the long winded prose and sentences, the extra details in what should be moments of action or fear don't fit at all with letter writing. Kostova cannot use the epistolary format authentically, and doesn't seem to care that the reader will find the set up unbelievable. And because how Paul writes letters sounds like how the narrator talks (and sounds like Rossi's letters as well), I found it that much harder to swallow, especially after reading Stoker's take so recently and how well he was able to pull it off, and be true to character voices AND to making a letter sound like a letter.If Kostova had excised the unnecessary first narrator, and removed the epistolary format, and centered the narrative around Paul and Helen with the flashbacks/letters of Rossi, the book probably would have been two stars for me. But it would still only go up a star because...(view spoiler)[ DRACULA IS BARELY IN IT AND HIS ROLE AND MOTIVATIONS ARE ASININE.  (hide spoiler)]It is not good that the research and scholarship of Dracula is far more interesting than the character itself once he finally arrives. And what good is it to give us such rich history of Vlad Tepes/Vlad Dracul, the Order of the Dragon and the secret knights of the Sultan opposed to him for all eternity, his cults, folklore, songs, if it comes to naught in creating a worthwhile, significant character when he appears in the flesh on the page? The idea of (and fear and pursuit of) Dracula is far better than Dracula himself, which is entirely a let down and very deflating. And what is Dracula's master plan? What is his motivation behind leaving creepy little books as calling cards and having his fiendish flunkies kill cats and third tier side characters? Why have these historians been toiling and pursuing him? (view spoiler)[ Because he needs an expert librarian to catalogue his extensive, ancient library. That's it. DRACULA WANTS A PERSONAL LIBRARIAN (Oh and take over the world of course, but we're told little about that.)  (hide spoiler)] And I thought Stoker's Dracula was absent, but at least he built the horror and tension needed to believe in his cruelty and malice. Here we are told in letters and research about young Vlad Dracul's impaling oriented exploits, but its all undone by the dry, overstuffed language of the discoveries and the absence of any impaler like activities in the main narrative (Paul's daughter and Paul's). Why even be Vlad the Impaler if he never impales anyone??? Kostova's Dracula is entirely neutered when he appears on page, and ultimately undoes any charm or creativity about the historical research into the background of Dracula.If I felt the climax of Stoker's Dracula was a bit weak, the climax to The Historian for all intents and purposes does not exist, that's how bad / short / stupid / unsatisfying it was for me. Not to be overly crude, but if I was going to suffer through all Kostova's masturbatory prose and poor execution (with a side of mice travelogue), I was expecting one hell of a climax at the end, some reason for reading this. But there's no pay off, there's no there there. Fortunately I will never need to read this book again: it's two readings too many as it is....more",Notes are private!,0,24,2,"Oct 14, 2016not set","Oct 16, 2016not set","Sep 06, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10692.The_Historian
