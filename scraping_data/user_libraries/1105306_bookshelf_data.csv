The narrators Allyson Johnson and Diontae Black are both familiar to me. I listened to at least one novel narrated by both narrators prior to this. For this novel both narrators assumed unique tones, employing inflection and even accent changes as needed for the short stories in this anthology. The narration reminded me of stories shared before bed, around a campfire or shared at a sleepover, just nostalgic in the best ways. I'll continue to seek out audiobooks narrated by both Ms. Johnson and Mr. Black in the future.I love anthologies precisely for the opportunity to meet new authors that I can add to my ever growing to-be-read list.

Ms. Evans is absolutely amazing as the voice of Eleanor. This book has some elements that I think make narrating this novel challenging. Ms. Evans hit it out of the park, so to speak. I'll be seeking other novels narrated by her because she was such a treat in this. She made the whole novel come to life. This book is so much more than your standard cozy mystery, and I loved everything about it! Eleanor, our main character, is the author of an extremely popular cozy vacation mystery series. The  main character of her book series is based on Connor, a man Eleanor met while on vacation in Italy a decade ago. When Eleanor returned home from that vacation, she wrote a cozy mystery set in Italy with Connor as the main sleuth. The novel became the first in her wildly successful cozy mystery series and a runaway NY Times bestseller. The success of her first novel catapulted Eleanor into instant fame and financial security virtually overnight.The action of the novel is set during a multi-author cozy mystery series book promotion tour stuffed with eccentric tour guides, annoying fellow genre authors, uncomfortable press moments, and awkward superfan interactions. As the tour stops at picturesque historical tourist sites, fancy hotels, and for posh dinners, we learn that Eleanor and her traveling companions have secrets of their own.When it appears that someone may be attempting to murder a participant on the book tour, Eleanor struggles to pinpoint just who is the possible victim and who is the possible villain. Eleanor brings the reader along and challenges them to solve the mystery themselves. In fact, Eleanor regularly breaks the fourth wall and speaks directly to the reader, which is handled in a fun way. Breaking the fourth wall and addressing the audience directly is a literary trick that I often don't enjoy in novels. For it to work, especially in a cozy mystery, in fact, to become my favorite feature of the audiobook was deeply unexpected and incredibly fun. This is one of the best cozies I've ever read, the plot, the characters, the pacing, all chef's kiss.  I eagerly await the next book in this series. Thank you to Macmillan Audio, Catherine Mack, and NetGalley for the opportunity to listen to and  this audiobook novel.

This novel is expertly narrated by Eilidh Beaton.3.5 Rounded UpThis audiobook was made available to me by NetGalley in exchange for an honest . This novel is expertly narrated by Eilidh Beaton. Her tone is perfect for a thriller novel, and her voice perfectly embodied Ashley. I'll be sure to seek out additional books narrated by her.This novel opens with Roberta enjoying a picturesque country morning, listening to Bruno Mars, and driving too fast on a country road before a sudden catastrophic accident. The novel then jumps a few weeks to the main character, Ashley, who is getting ready to attend a ninth birthday party for her best friend Lucy's daughter, Grace. Attending the party with Ashley is her husband Danny, her sister Suzy, and her son Elliott. Ashley & Danny own and run a marketing company called Blue Banana Studio and live in Time End, a small middle-class village suburb outside of London. Danny grew up in Time End and pushed to move there after Elliot was born. Ashley is more of a London person and is somewhat struggling to adjust to small town life.Lucy and her husband, Lee, are very wealthy, and this birthday party is fancy & pretentious. Ashley is navigating the social event when there's a murder and her husband is found near a dead Lucy's body, bloody and holding the murder weapon. Lucy's husband, Lee, insists that Danny murdered Lucy. Ashley is shocked, navigating grief, disbelief, and the desire to protect her son, Elliott. This spirals into Ashley seeking out if she knows her husband as well as she thinks she does. If Danny didn't murder Lucy, who did and why? Small towns are famously full of old secrets, and this is no exception. Was Lucy having an affair? Was Danny having an affair? Was Lee, Lucy's husband, jealous? Was this related to Lucy & Lee's business interests? I found Ashley a bit more curious than I think I'd be in a similar situation, but her behavior only slightly pushed incredulity. So the story works really well. I could not pause until I found out who did it and why they did it.The reveals make sense and work without being too shocking. Sometimes domestic thrillers can be a bit reveal heavy. I love a few shocking reveals, but hate reveals that don't move the story forward. This has reveals, but they feel organic and unforced. I'll definitely be looking for other thrillers from this author.Thank you to NetGalley for the opportunity to listen to and  this audiobook novel.

The last thing a casual reader of history wants with a text like this is to be put to sleep by a boring professorial droning style narration. Cheatham handles this superbly with the exception of his pronunciation of African-American Vernacular English. There's a few direct quotes from formerly enslaved folks included in the text, and the narrator seems to struggle with pronunciation. Otherwise, it was very well done keeping the flow of text interesting.I thoroughly enjoyed this book and fully plan to buy a copy of this for my own personal studies on the so-called peculiar institution. The author is extremely respectful in his discussions of enslaved folks, using the term 'enslaved' vs 'slave', which I appreciated. He avoided language like slave concubine or mistress in describing enslaved women and their situationships with white male slave owners or handlers. This isn't often done, especially if the focus is the Confederacy. I've found historians hesitate to face the horrors of slavery if the focus is from the point of view of Southerners. That's not an issue in this text, and as much as possible, we hear directly from the enslaved themselves.While I have extensively studied chattel slavery as experienced by West Africans across the diaspora, I'm not as familiar with the US Civil War. Nor had I realized the deep impact that slavery had on the Confederate States. I mean, I knew the Civil War was about slavery and in defense of States Rights to own other human beings, but I hadn't realized how much actual trading in enslaved people continued during the war years.In many ways, the hopefulness of the Confederacy can be judged by the dollar value enslaved folks are assigned during this period. This fluctuated based on the state, the advance of the Union Army, and enslaved folks' ability to run off to the Union. The Civil War caused many Confederate slave owners to speculate on what would make them the most money after the war. As a result, there was a rigorous trade in women and children. Children were often cheaper and judged based on the speculation of their adult labor. Women were purchased for what was called their 'increase'. I know that often enslaved folks' children brought their captors more money than their labor did. Once it was illegal to bring new enslaved folks over from Africa, that automatically increased the value of the enslaved folks already in the US. This was increased further by exploiting and breeding enslaved women and girls. So many Confederate soldiers advise their wives and families to invest in these specific type of enslaved people. Enslaved men always ran away the most, and the war increased these fears in Confederate slave owners.Truly interesting was that many enslaved families were broken up and displaced during this period. Husbands, wives, children, and other family members sold apart from each other. Often sold deeper into the Confederacy in hopes of keeping the enslaved from Union promises of freedom. Or ruining that freedom by leaving the enslaved states away from beloved family members. As a final act of cruelty, many former enslavers refused their formerly enslaved any information about where their loved ones had been sold or relocated to. This cruel practice drastically increased suffering for the formerly enslaved and still impacts Black Americans today. Most of us struggle to locate lost family members as slave owners records are still today considered private property. In essence, my ancestors are still owned by the descendants of those who enslaved them as the information has been refused to my family. It's infuriating and unfair. Their records should've been confiscated during Reconstruction. It was surprising to read about the rigorous sale of enslaved and free Black folks during the Civil War. Free Black folks were stolen and sold further south by regular slave traders. Escaped formerly enslaved folks who freed themselves could be returned to slavery or sold to other enslavers by Union soldiers looking to make quick money. In Union held Slave States like Maryland & Kentucky, enslaved folks were smuggled into Confederate States to be sold at higher prices. Confederate soldiers stole other Confederates enslaved folks to make quick money. Some enslaved folks were sold to punish them by owners upset about the Civil War. Even as prices dropped, this rather rigorous trade continued even into 1865! I learned a lot about how slavery operated in the Confederacy and a bit about how it worked in the Union. This really added depth to my understanding of this period in history.Thank you to NetGalley for the opportunity to listen to and  this audiobook.

Even though this novel uses a single pov character, the narrator still uses different infections to highlight different characters: the mom, the fiancé, the sister, etc. It adds depth and texture to the story. This narrator has a kind of soft voice that serves to make the creepy elements of the story sinister. It's subtly done and had a great impact on the overall story.This is a domestic thriller featuring toxic family drama, my favorite flavor! Lizzie has  returned to the UK from teaching abroad with her new fiance, Owen. Lizzie was teaching abroad in an effort to pay off her financial liability from her previous romantic entanglement when she met Owen about 6 months before the story began. A surprise pregnancy prompted a return to the UK and engagement. Back in the UK, Owen is awaiting payment for his work abroad while the couple is staying at Lizzie's friend, Peter's, flat. Lizzie's mum invites them for the weekend so she can meet Owen. Soon Mum is pushing a rushed wedding on Lizzie & Owen. Lizzie wants away from her toxic mom and to avoid a situation like her sister, Shelly. Shelly is a large animal vet recovering from her own wedding nightmare, at which her fiancé, Rafe, was found dead of a probable heart attack the morning of. Only Lizzie isn't sure Rafe died of natural causes. Lizzie's mom has shades of narcissistic parent syndrome and reminded me of several Reddit posts on the narc parents subreddit thread. Lizzie seems like the 'black sheep' and her sister Shelly is a classic 'golden child' but there's much more to the story than what appears on the surface. Thank you to NetGalley for the opportunity to read/listen to and  this novel.

This is a heavy read, with heavy themes. I personally find nonfiction books with serious themes like this best consumed via audiobook over other formats. I love the feel of a heavy tome in my hands, but I never lose myself in nonfiction text the same. A narrative in which I'm given the opportunity to experience firsthand accounts of prisoners' experiences, in their own words, is greatly enhanced in audiobook format. I felt like the narrator was a perfect guide for this journey. My political view is abolition, so this fits nicely into my views. What I love about this, though, is that the text doesn't assume the reader is a well-versed abolitionist. The book cleverly utilized multiple formats to enhance the reader's understanding of these crucial issues. There's direct quotes from incarcerated individuals, research done by the author, and essays on the topic all mixed in with the author's stunning original poetry. A full media experience, especially on audiobook.Another highlight of this book is the focus on Canadian prison reform. Often, when prison reform is brought up, even in Canada, the focus is on US style prisons. I was not very familiar with Canadian prisons before this book. I'm a Statie, as I was called in Ontario, married to a Canadian. I lived in Ontario for almost 14 years. A member of my husband's family trained to be a prison counselor and assured me that Canadian prison was focused on reform and nothing like the US system. ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,"Mar 15, 2024","Mar 04, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/121721996-abolitionist-intimacies

The narrator had a nice voice, with a soot3.5 Stars Rounded Up This audiobook was made available to me by Netgalley in exchange for an honest . The narrator had a nice voice, with a soothing pitch and tone. I found that as the novel moved on, the narration faded into the background, leaving just the story. It was an enjoyable experience. I really love cozies and adore this cover. I requested to  this novel on the cover and genre alone. I was not disappointed. Cozy mysteries are usually more about the characters, setting and mood than the mystery. When I read cozies, I need to like the main character. Which is weird because I love a thriller with an unlikable MC. Lucky for me, I found Eliza the perfect blend of confidence, intelligence, and self-assurance. She was 16 and a relatively new member of semi-adult status. She is the daughter of a minor land-owning gentry family. It's just her still at home with her parents as her older sister, Charlotte, married primarily to get away from their desperately unhappy household. Her parents argue often, and her father's younger brother, Uncle James, seems to be her protector and confidante. The family's finances are ruinous, which leads to stress in their village and with the family's servants. Amidst this family drama, her father leaves home angry one evening, and he fails to return by the following morning. Eliza hooks up with the village Constable, Pritchard, to solve the mystery of her father's disappearance. I found the interactions between Eliza and Constable Pritchard to be overly familiar with regard to how unmarried women moved in Victorian society. She repeatedly meets with him alone. He sends her notes to meet him, and she actually goes. This seems truly odd for the times she lived in. Now, if she had a ladies' maid passing notes between them or acting as a chaperone, maybe. Eliza's level of freedom off her family's Estates doesn't seem period appropriate. Eliza ventures off on her own more than I think would've been allowed at that time period for an unmarried woman of her class. This novel somewhat ignores period appropriate class rules. It feels off for the Victorian Era, which is the height of British class divisions. It made the story feel modern but didn't impact my enjoyment overall. I didn't like that the reveal happened 'off page', so to speak. None the less I found this story very charming and look forward to the next novel in this series.Thank you to Netgalley for the opportunity to read/listen to and  this novel.

I honestly thought I would like this book, or I This book was made available to me in audiobook format by Netgalley in exchange for an honest . I honestly thought I would like this book, or I would not have chosen to  it. This  is complex, as are the issues dealt with in this text. I will explain my low score to the best of my ability.First, I want to start with what I loved, which was the audiobook format. If you are going to read this, please consider choosing the audiobook format. This featured what sounded like a cast of Black voices reading quotes. It was delightful, and I adored it. What a wonderful way to illustrate the mostly lost voices of these folks. I also want to say that while I do not agree with the author, all of the history is thoroughly sourced. It is wonderful for the quotes alone from the Civil War era, Black folks. I can not stress how much hearing their own words spoken touched me. I fully plan to read more by this author when I get to my studies of Abraham Lincoln. I don't think the author meant any malice as he left the final impression of Lincoln up to the reader. I feel he does this by excusing Lincoln's racist statements and behaviors as either misunderstood by modern audiences or said to influence his racist white peers. I disagree with this view of his behaviors. It gives Lincoln too much grace and doesn't acknowledge that white supremacy has never functioned in logical ways. The problem with this book is its implication that Black Lives Matter and other anit-racist activist organizations were shortsighted to call Abraham Lincoln racist or a supporter of white supremacy. The author wanted to highlight Lincoln's history with the Black Community to add context to this discussion. This argument includes the idea that historical figures can not or should not be judged with today's morals.The text began with this quote, ""In January 2021, the San Francisco Unified School District voted to rename Abraham Lincoln High School because of the former president’s policies toward Native Americans and African Americans According to Jeremiah Jeffries, chairman of the renaming committee and a first-grade teacher, “Lincoln, like the presidents before him and most after, did not show through policy or rhetoric that black lives ever mattered to them outside of human capital and as casualties of wealth building.” Only a month earlier, a statue of Lincoln outside of San Francisco City Hall had been vandalized with red paint, presumably to symbolize the guilt the former president bears for his role in the nation’s racial history.""This book is mostly comprised of the author responding to the above paragraph using direct quotes taken from Black folks who met with Lincoln from 1861-1865. These meetings with Lincoln mostly involved him shaking hands and listening to Black folk when they speak to him. The author thinks this helped Lincoln to change how he viewed Black people. I personally think that Lincoln was pragmatic and knew the post civil war United States was going to need the contributions that the Black Community would (and did) make during the Civil War, Reconstruction and beyond. I do believe that Black Leaders who met with Lincoln influenced him, but that isn't an indication that Lincoln didn't hold racist and white supremacist beliefs. That would be logical. Racism and white supremacy have never employed logic in its functionality. The purpose of both racism and white supremacy is to give white people, men, especially, power to do as they please.The reason that Black Lives Matter and other anti-racist activist organizations label Lincoln racist or white supremacis is in relation to the following direct quotes made during a debate with Senator Douglas, ""I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races ... I am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of Negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will forever forbid the two races from living together on terms of social and political equality. And inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be a position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race.""Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines racism as: 1) a belief that race is a fundamental determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular racealso : behavior or attitudes that reflect and foster this belief : racial discrimination or prejudice2) a. the systemic oppression of a racial group to the social, economic, and political advantage of anotherb. a political or social system founded on racism and designed to execute its principlesMerriam-Webster Dictionary defines white supremacy as: 1) the belief that the white race is inherently superior to other races and that white people should have control over people of other races2) the social, economic, and political systems that collectively enable white people to maintain power over people of other racesBlack Lives Matter and other anti-racism movements accurately labeling Lincoln a racist or white supremacist align with his historical presence. Neither Lincoln shaking the hands of Black folks nor listening to the concerns of Black Leaders alters these indisputable facts.I've read in history books that Lincoln would yell and scream at Black leaders and that he blamed Black folks for slavery. To my knowledge, that was based on oral history from the Black post civil war community. The author attributed similar behavior by Lincoln to a single conversation with Black Leaders in 1862. The author explains that the rant was to placate racist white congress/senators/voters. I disagree, I think Lincoln meant what he said to those Black Leaders. I disagree with the author about Lincoln's desire to ship Black folks back to Africa. I believe it was based on racism. The author gives a weak argument about no one being forced to go, but it's clear this was a race based solution. After Lincoln was assassinated, a propagandist rather than a historically accurate narrative was applied to Abraham Lincoln as The Great Emancipator in the Black community, heavily supported by Black Leaders. Current Black historians see Lincoln in a much more complex way as the Black Community is now many generations removed from slavery and have more access to the complete history of his quotes. The author has deeply studied Abraham Lincoln for decades it sounds like and probably has a solid grasp on the traditional historical view of Lincoln. This doesn't mean that Black folks or other POC who view him based on the oppressive experiences of their ancestors are wrong. History is richer for the viewpoints of all parties involved, instead of what we have now, which is overwhelmingly the view of white historians based on their biased views of white leaders. History told from multiple viewpoints, even when they seem to conflict, in the end offers a richer view of history. My other concern was the author's use of moral relativism or not judging historical figures with todays values. In my opinion, this justification is overly used to excuse Western European colonial behaviors, often based on the ahistorical belief that 'everyone' thought like that at the time and thinking/behaving oppressively was just normal. The inherent problem with thinking 'everyone' thought like that at the time is who is being defined in the 'everyone'. I assure you the people being oppressed were not happy to be oppressed and did not agree with the oppressors' acts of oppression, no matter the people or the era. Moral relativism effectively silences POC opinions on the treatment of their own ancestors. Also, inconsistencies between how Western historians fail to apply the arguments of moral relativism to the practices of marginalized/colonized peoples. For example, when Mayan or Aztec folks are discussed historically, human sacrifice is mentioned in a judgmental way. Leaving the upsetting impression that it is okay to judge marginalized peoples and societies by modern values but not Western European societies.Additionally, we do not view Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Nate Turner, Harriet Tubman, etc. as they would have been viewed by white Americans in the time they were alive. Why is it okay to change as a nation how we view Black leaders but not how we view white leaders? It is inevitable that white historical 'heroes' will be overwhelmingly viewed as oppressors by the descendants of those they oppressed. A hero to one group of people is often an oppressor to another group.I could gather a bunch of quotes from Black Trump supporters about how he shook their hands and treated them kindly. It will not change the fact that Trump has made deeply racist and white supremacist statements.

It was amateurish like a cozy novel, but the facts were quite dark. It was ridiculously easy to guess the reveals, and the ending was deeply unsatisfying. I honestly hate the treatment of race, which was heavy-handed and bordered on simplicity. The treatment of race made me feel like the author was white or writing to white people. Most of the purpose of the story is to humanize the racist white girl who is never explicitly called racist no matter how racist her extreme actions are. Instead, it's treated like ignorance, and like being friends with Black folks and education on racism will solve racism. In the end, it even downplays Black activism and affirmative action instead pushing a silly, 'Let's just all get along' narrative. It's insulting and annoying.Only the Black characters speak in dialect when anyone who's ever spoken to a southern white knows they also speak in dialect. It was weird and in many ways bordering on antiblackness.If the author is actually Black, I'm gathering they are conservative and grew up in an all white area. The author gives off Candace Owen vibes. This is not a good book.

I can't understand why she fell in love with him nor why she would break with the Sisterhood for him. This novel doesn't provide an answer and worse yet makes Leto surprised and betrayed by Jessica's duty to the Sisterhood. It's nonsense.I think the authors need to let this go until they can come up with a better story or actually have something to add to the Canon.This just feels like an unsatisfying money grab.

It was traditional, the Firm simply didnt want them to work. Only the racism that Meghan first faces as a new girlfriend is covered.Now the author does point out that the public has an anger for Meghan doing the same thing as Kate,  for example touching her baby bump.Still it ignores much of what The Sussexes have themselves discussed in interviews and by Harry in Spare.The author chooses to use primarily British sources, ignoring British papers bias towards Meghan and while Afua Hirsh is quoted its very limited. In addition some of the info is just incorrect. For instance both Harry & Meghan still retain their HRH titles formally, they are forbidden from using them.Entirely ignored is Harry's own explanation of what The Sandringham Summit entailed and how they were not given choices.She uses the tired sexist 'megexit' talking points and ignores that couple have themselves given more insight into what happened.I find it weird that the only first person narrative is largely ignored in favor of tabloid fodder.Either way theres reslly nothing new here and this reads as a boring money grab by a relatively unknown reporter.I pirated this and am truly glad I did.I am not a royalist and I don't support monarchy. I find monarchy to a bullshit, oppressive, archaic institution and in Britain as in most of Europe, racist as fuck.That said Meghan was fine with that until she found that her kids would be excluded from the benefits, then and only then did she get upset.My concern is the ignoring of blatant fucking racism inorder to prop up a biased and bullshit institution.Its frustrating that folks just ignore the racism. Otherwise in most ways I dont care.Meghan & Harry are rich and they'll be fine.I'm gona assume this reporter is conservative. In the states most folks who hate Meghan also watch Faux News and think chump won the election in 2020.She continually refers to folks who had antiracist views as 'woke' but fails correctly identify conservatives as racist. Its frustrating because she carefully never defines 'woke' as most conservatives refuse to do as well.She utterly ignores the vitriol online, that both Meghan & Archie were called the n-word on royal sites, comments that can still be viewed on royal social media. The racism was measured and ed undoubtably covering how Meghan is viewed.I hate the author treats antiracism work as a 'culture war' vs holding racists responsible for their fucked up views. I'd give the actual narrative 1 star, too many inaccuracies for my tastes.However the audiobook used voice clips from interviews and it was really nice. So I weighed that in my overall score....more",Notes are private!,2,11,1,"Dec 07, 2023","Dec 07, 2023","Dec 07, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/200272577-unroyal

Folks have a right to opinions and critiques.Scobie was kinder and more diplomatic than I'd have tried to be.CIII is a grumpy and unimportant monarch who mostly acts as a bridge between the late QEII & the future William V. I think Charles' scant meaningful time on the throne has shaped and driven his policies and modus operandi.William does have a terrible temper, and Kate was called a lazy royal by the same British papers, now crying foul. I think it's nice that Kate focuses primarily on their kids. More royals need to do that. She has grown into the job, but 'palace sources' claimed to the press that she wasn't as prepared as Meghan. I also love that Scobie called out Kate changing her dress and style to copy Meghan. It's very obvious. Wills & Kate did all they could to make Meghan suicidal while she was pregnant with their nephew and then promptly copied her style. Fucking ass clowns the pair of them.This book is very current & relevant. The issues raised are important and fair. The BRF has treated their own horribly: Diana, Fergie, Harry, Meghan, etc.The comparison between how CIII treats his non-working royal pedophile brother, Andy, and his non-working royal son reflects his character or lack thereof. He won't pay for security for his own grandkids who were under terrible threats of violence, unmatched by any experiences being visited on Will & Kate's kids but will pay for his brothers security....more",Notes are private!,22,64,1,"Nov 27, 2023","Nov 28, 2023","Nov 27, 2023",,Audio CD,view (with text),/book/show/156736095-endgame

This is a young adult horror novel set at a camp with thriller This audiobook was made available to me by NetGalley in exchange for an honest . This is a young adult horror novel set at a camp with thriller and supernatural elements sprinkled throughout. Similar to 'You're Not Supposed to Die Tonight' by Kalynn Bayron and American Horror Story Season 9 '1984'. This just has that nostalgic 80's horror movie feel. As I'm a Gen Xer, this is like revisiting my childhood horror stories.This is an action packed novel and pulled me right in from the first page so to speak. Temple is a Camp Counselor at Pride Rocks, a themed LGBTQA+ horror overnight girls camp. Added to the horror is that the 'camp' is located on the family farm that Temple grew up on. Temple's father is the famous North Point Killer, a serial murderer who is behind bars as the story opens. Temple has returned to where she grew up to look for her mother's body. Her father has confessed to murdering her mother but her mom's body was never found. Temple has to know what happened and goes undercover at the camp as a counselor to be able to access her old family farm. Once Temple is ensconced in the camp as a counselor, a dead body turns up. It's too freshly killed to be left by Temple's Dad. Temple has been haunted by her father's weird serial killer groupies and immediately thinks this is a copycat. This has supernatural elements and the horror is hair-raising. The action is pulse pounding. I could not stop listening until this story was over. This is layered and very fun. This novel is expertly narrated by Tamika Katon-Donegal. Her voice is perfect for an older teen novel of this type. I like that Tamika applied tone changes to represent other characters in the novel. I'll be sure to seek out additional books narrated by her.Thank you to NetGalley for the opportunity to listen to and  this audiobook novel.

The narrator has an absolutely stunning singing voice. In additThis audiobook was made available to me by Netgalley in exchange for an honest . The narrator has an absolutely stunning singing voice. In addition to her skills regarding narration, the singing really made this story feel like I was watching a movie. Exceptionally well done. I'm not sure if I've listened to an audiobook read by Angel Pean before, but I'll be sure to look for her work in the future.This novel is a harrowing read in many ways as it's set during the end of chattel slavery in the US South. Louella Bobo is enslaved on the Montgomery Plantation in 1864 Mississippi at the opening of the novel. She's heard about the Emancipation Proclamation from her father and wants to leave the plantation with her family and neighbors. Unfortunately, the Emancipation Proclamation has no power in the Confederate States, as Louella soon discovered.Shortly thereafter, she married Reverend William, the biracial son of the plantation owner, who has some privileges on the plantation. William is literate and gave Louella the gift of literacy. William had a brother, Robert, who was light enough to pass for white and was a slave owner on another plantation. Eventually, Louella, William, Robert, and many of the formerly enslaved from the Montgomery and surrounding plantations set off in a series of wagons looking for greener pastures and greater opportunities.The traveling is somewhat anxiety provoking, but eventually, the traveling group settles on land they've purchased as a group on the border of North & South Carolina. They call this land the 'Happy Land' and crown Louella & William their Queen & King. I don't want to give spoilers, but the kingdom of Happy Land is established about 40% into the book. I liked that because I was interested in the actual living situation in the Happy Land over the circumstances and journey that brought them to the Happy Land.The Christian themes felt heavy. I wanted more discussion about the fractures that occur in Christianity that lead formerly enslaved Black folks to form their own churches. My great-grandfather was a COGIC Minister in Florida because of treatment in white churches. I wish this had explored more of the Black Agency that occurred under Reconstruction. I wanted to see the formerly enslaved men register to vote. I wanted to see the book talk about the first Black Senators voted into office in Mississippi. However, this focuses on the ruinous racism that characterized the fall of the Confederacy in Mississippi. Louella and her people leave before Reconstruction takes hold. Which is understandable given the Black Codes they are suffering under. I really hoped the novel would include period details about Black life that were based on superstition and folklore. There's no bottle trees or haint blue porches. No discussion of restless spirits, etc. This is just the historian in me as none of this detracts from the story. Thank you to Netgalley for the opportunity to read/listen to and  this novel.

This is a young adult fantasy novel set in our recognizable modThis audiobook was made available to me by Netgalley in exchange for an honest . This is a young adult fantasy novel set in our recognizable modern world with magic added in the form of Witchers. The term 'witchers' seems to encompass multiple forms of magic from healers to shape shifters, to potion makers, and everything in between.Venus is a teenager who is supporting her family using her powers to brew and sell illegal love potions, leveraging her ability as a deviant host to sentient parasitic magic with its own danger and priceFor complicated and (spoiler) reasons, Venus is the primary magical wage earner in her household. This impacts her relationship with her parents and siblings beyond the usual parentification of eldest daughters. This story had multiple minor characters in political style relationships. To keep up, I took notes of who was who and how they related to the story. The first half of the novel primarily focuses on world building at a steady but slower pace. About midway through the novel, a reveal sets off the real action, and the pace picks up accordingly.I found the magic system to be interesting, complex, bloody, and dark. The 'Witcherpedia' references were absolutely adorable. Witcher social standing is cleverly handled in a way that explores how racism functions to oppress POC in frustrating and nonsensical ways in the USA. Sometimes, when this is a theme in a novel, it can feel overdone or heavy-handed. I find this type of storytelling requires a delicate balance, which this novel manages lightly and to great effect. I found the parallels to the Black Lives Matter protests and clashes with police violence, perfectly handled. The unbelievably satisfying ending, left me with the hope this is the first book in a planned series.I truly enjoyed the audiobook version. The narrator, Lynnette R. Freeman, with slight changes in tone and pitch, created uniqe voices for the characters, assisting my ability to keep characters separated.Thank you to Netgalley for the opportunity to read/listen to and  this novel....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Feb 26, 2024","Feb 27, 2024","Nov 18, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/169584901-the-poisons-we-drink

Clearly this is because Lily's chapters were written by Jennifer Finney Boylan. I'll definitely be adding her books to my tbr list. Aspects of the story and the issues tackled felt overwhelming. Yet, I think if we're honest much of what felt overwhelming was actually statistically pretty valid and somewhat common:Same-sex marriage is wonderfully normalized. Gay folks exist, some of them marry and raise children together. Interracial couples exist, I'm the child of a 'Loving Generation' interracial marriage. I'm currently in am Interracial marriage they're fairly common at this point. Both of these examples simply exist in the novel. They're barely even characters. It's not forced or preachy these folks simply exist.LGBTQA+ representstion amongst Gen Z is touched on but only 1 of these is an important character to the novel. A character has an abortion but thats also statistically quite common, its only mentioned in a single scene. Racism is mentioned by a Black  character in again, a single scene. Which is statistically common as Black folks make up 12% of the population and racism is scientifically proven to exist in the legal system.I literally don't get the complaints about this being preachy, people who aren't white, aren't cis, aren't straight, etc exist in society today. Their representation as characters in a novel isn't really political. Its natural to not be cis or white or straight. People simply showing up as they are isn't political. If you as a reader found it so, you're a fucking bigot. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Nov 11, 2023","Nov 11, 2023","Nov 11, 2023",,Audiobook,view (with text),/book/show/60827860-mad-honey

Look, his behaviors were way out of character in the last installment, his non-remorse paired with his shock that he was held responsible for his actions by the town just jumped the shark for me. Who is this Mal? This can't be the guy we've been getting to know since book 1.Anyone can make a mistake. Most of us will do so even at the expense of those we love. However, this deeply horrifying betrayal was treated like his transgression was more immoral than illegal, but it was both.I don't believe in prison, but he needs to be kicked out of Henry Adams.This was ludicrous and a bad precedent to set.This series has always been very steeped in respectability politics, but the idea that a Black person committing a crime has harmed or embarrassed 'the race' is harmful bullshit.

An interesting visit with old and dear friends.The true but rarely known US history included in all elements of this novel are handled with a very deft hand. So the harsh history is honored, but the sad/bad feeling is muted so to seamlessly fit into an otherwise cozy story without interrupting the sweet after taste.That's a real skill and helps me swallow my complaints below.Spoilers below:...................................This novel bothered me. The ridiculous sexism involved in Mel's storyline. Like in what world are we blaming the victim for his own bad behaviors because his grown ass didn't know how to speak to the town minister/therapist? Plus, why is he cruel? I'm tired of the main drama in the novels being the sexist and boneheaded behavior of the male love interest in a heterosexual relationship. It's always just kinda forgiven and overlooked. It's like a Tyler Perry dramedy encouraging women to be patient with sorry ass men. It's so dated.The addition of more police, like why they have hardly any citizens. Usually, in small towns, crime is low and usually vandalism. Now cameras are being extended to cover more of the town. I realize it's to drive the story, but yikes.Foster kids don't need to be raised in such a heavily monitored and policed environment.The town is in the literal middle of nowhere. A single sheriff, voted in by citizens, would be standard. The state police would handle large or conplicated crimes. This just ruins the town for me.In addition, I disliked how trauma resulting from transracial adoption was treated. White parents struggle to raise children of color.This is addressed in Colin in Black & White on Netflix really well.I think this particular foster parent was clearly the better choice but to dismiss that these types of foster/adoptions create adults that often require decades of therapy.My mom is white, she carried me in her body and is racist as fuck. We no longer speak. Her family was also awful. I don't speak to any of them. They were all liberal with the exception of my youngest aunt who has a biracial child and is a maga-Karen. Its a fucking mess. I can't imagine what this is like for fostered and adopted kids but from what I've read it's much worse.Also are we gonna ignore that conservative racists often adopt Black kids to try to prove their racist agendas? This is a well documented history and the story didn't need to deal with race in this way at all. This manufactured conservative storyline was uncomfortable.I think I'll pass on the Henry Adams in this novel....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Nov 02, 2023","Nov 02, 2023","Nov 02, 2023",,Audible Audio,view (with text),/book/show/35530318-chasing-down-a-dream

There are multiple point of view (pov) characters and January was able to very effectively give each of these characters a unique tone, inflection and style of speaking to make it easier for the listener/reader to differentiate between the characters.Even with the wonderful narration, there were so many similar characters I found myself confused in places. About 20% into the book, I started a character list and took light notes. The characters were not complicated, really, just rich and shameless. Parts of this story almost read like a season of  HBO's The White Lotus TV show. The novel wasn't quite as funny as the show but definitely had quirks that would easily be laughable on camera. I tend to enjoy thriller novels with unlikable main characters, and this was no exception.The main action of this novel is set at the annual week-long retreat for the senior staff of Aurora tech startup at an exclusive resort in Miami. The founder John, his assistant, and his most senior seven-figure salaried chief officer of their department staff members, including a new hire who has yet to work her first day at the company. This has an eccentric founder, Elon Musk-style, a hard-nosed investigative reporter, and vapid, competitive, shallow, selfish staff members. The cast is perfect for this type of domestic thriller. Revealed during the retreat are surprises planned by the founder as well as unplanned surprises revealed by the various founder and his staff members. In between these reveals, the characters are busy heavy drinking, with hook-ups, hard drugs, dancing, swimming, and planned group excursions. Most of the staff members have a long and secretive history with each other and the company with a major financial incentive to keep the company's secrets hidden. This is fast-paced, amusing, quirky, and an excellent thriller. I thoroughly enjoyed this fast-paced story. I think the story would have benefited from maybe 2 fewer pov characters. Also  some of the Black woman characters’ personality & bio felt stereotypical, including her background and dating situation. I liked this author's previous thriller and will definitely read her next novel.Thank you to Macmillan Audio and NetGalley for the opportunity to listen to and  this audiobook novel. All opinions and viewpoints expressed in this  are my own. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,Apr 2024,"Apr 03, 2024","Sep 11, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/195790649-very-bad-company

It's certainly in poor taste and feeds into a lot of conservative white supremacist mythology. I'm sure the author never intended that but that's what this view of history upholds.

These tales always ignore the violence inherent in a white supremacist society. The revolution wouldn't be led by highly formally educated people. No lawyer is giving up their well-earned place in white supremacy, and poor folks on the street wouldn't trust such a leader.Ferguson Uprising lasted 14 months and needed none of what was happening here.This is a lot of 'if we fight back, we become like who we fight' liberal 'they go low, we go high' farcical thinking. To those that think this, I say, 'Get out of the way of those of us not willing to die perfect victims'.We want to see real change in our lifetimes, and we heard Audre Lorde when she stated that the masters tools will never dismantle the masters house. Real change within our lifetime is possible. I wish this had understood what's come before it and built on that or at least spoken to real revolutionaries. Hint: probably not many enrolled in law school. What I hoped this would address is the fate of revolutionaries. What happened to the Ferguson Uprising protectors? Most are dead, quietly murdered by our police state. The police and alphabet groups have been setting up and taking out Black revolutionaries for centuries. Cointelpro proved that beyond the shadow of a doubt.This was largely a missed opportunity for me.

I'm familiar with the history this covers and still felt fucking confused with how this jumped all over the place.It's not just about the houses and that plot is lost a bit in the narrative.Also this attempts to excuse chattel slavery under the guise of, ""we can't judge the past using the values of the present"" but that's not true.Slavery was always wrong and Europeans knew that during the Trans Atlantic Slave Trade but created that trade anyway.Further the reason the past is important in this instance and all instances is because the past informs the present.Most chocolate consumed today is grown in West Africa using modern slavery. Most critical parts for cell phones also use modern day slavery of marginalized peoples on colonized and formerly colonized landsHowever, if you see who's currently profiting off of these practices today, you'll find that in most cases, they are the descendants of those same families that profited off of chattel slavery back in the day. So it becomes clear both why this information is paramount AND why the common refrain from academia is to pretend that history is isolated from the present. No the fuck it's not.When we excuse slavery of the past we also excuse slavery of the present.When we judge the people of the past that works to stop the same behavior from occurring in modern society.Stop looking for ways to excuse these folks, let's hold them accountable instead. The world sucks balls, and excusing inexcusable behaviors is part and parcel of why....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jun 22, 2023","Jun 24, 2023","Jun 22, 2023",,Audio CD,view (with text),/book/show/70992702-the-story-of-the-country-house

The author doesn't understand some of the nuances of racism and how it intersects with success. I say this is reference to Cardi B. Who is mentioned often in this text for her ability to break class, race and gender boundaries. Yet the main reason this path was open to Cardi B is because she's light skin and obviously a POC but reads as ambiguous. Meg Thee Stallion would not be allowed that same access to success, even though she's arguably more talented.I'm a fan of both stars but Meg is definitely more talented.At the same time Meg was blamed for being shot in the foot by a much less well known and status rapper.That does not relate to reality TV bur it is a part of sociology which would understand why Meg is treated differently than Cardi.None the less well done and informative....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jun 12, 2023","Jun 13, 2023","Jun 12, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/57187974-true-story

Reconstruction itself is a Golden Age in American history in which Black folks, voted, held office, owned property and during which interracial marriage was legal.Anti-miscegenation Laws in Alabama are placed in the state constitution in 1901. During the time this story is set those laws did not apply.Reconstruction is not taught in schools and very few Americans truly understand its importance and significance.I highly recommend checking out Reconstruction on PBS hosted by historian Henry Louis Gates Jr.For nonfiction history books I'd suggest: Black Reconstruction by W.E.B. Du BoisStony the Road by Henry Louis Gates Jr.Reconstruction & The Second Founding by Eric FonerI Saw Death Coming by Kidada E. Williams covers the fall of Reconstruction which brings about the well known Black Codes that usher in Jim & Jane Crow.To offer a slight education to anyone interested I included just simple Google Search results.Google Resources:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-mi....https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Al...https://www.loc.gov/classroom-materia....https://history.house.gov/Historical-....https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremia......more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jun 09, 2023","Jun 09, 2023","Jun 09, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/40195163-the-cost-of-hope

I highly recommend the biographies of both written by John Hardman to understand their personalities and the role Marie Antoinette played in the downfall of the French Bourbon Monarchy. The Road to Versailles by Munro Price is an excellent study into the events that led to the Revolution and whether Louis XVI needed to die. This kinda sorta works. It's extremely simplified, drops many political aspects that could've strengthened the story, and focuses on the lack of sex life between Marie & Louis more than was necessary.I liked how Fersen was handled, but frankly, the Princesse de Lamballe deserved better as she was the most loyal friend the Marie Antoinette had. What doesn't work is that the couple are monarchs for decades before being beheaded. So this felt rushed, confused, and anticlimactic. Also, I'm unsure if the author really understands what the first, second, and third estate are and how that impacted the revolution.The low rating is for the suggestion that rebellion against unjust governments are unfair, corrupt, and doomed to failure.France post revolution was fucking amazing. Women could divorce and did, after Napoleon French women will lose that freedom for almost 200 yrs. Haiti wins their freedom as do other French Caribbean islands. Jewish people are treated fairly. Napoleon is antisemitic and racist. He reinstated slavery across the Caribbean with the exception of Haiti because Toussaint Louveture beat the French Army. The death of rich people isn't a big deal. 1 million french peasants starved to death when Louis XIV built Versailles. Less than 40,000 people died during the Revolution. Shit Napoleon killed millions during his wars.We learn about those that died during the so-called reign of terror but ignore that they were much less than was regularly dying under 1st Estate Management. The trials weren't 'unfair' except that rich people were never subject to the same laws as poor people.Like now. If I steal from my boss I'm arrested immediately. If my boss steals from me, via my check is short, it's not a crime and I have to jump through hoops to get satisfaction.Laws protect rich folks at the expense of everyone else. So yes the courts were unfair but the nobility didn't care until that unfairness was applied to them. So their deaths were justified...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jun 03, 2023","Jun 04, 2023","Jun 03, 2023",,Audiobook,view (with text),/book/show/62355840-cake-eater

This has multiple narrators for the multiple POV characters/chaThis audiobook was made available to me by NetGalley in exchange for an honest . This has multiple narrators for the multiple POV characters/chapters. I like this because this world is complicated, and this makes it easier to keep track of who is who and who said what. Plus, this has one of my favorite narrators, Bahni Turpin. There's also little musical jingles at the start of the book between sections and, at the end of the book, delightful ragtime/jazz horns. This is a young adult fantasy novel with a magic system based somewhat on Black culture set in and around New Orleans, Louisiana. The magic system features, in part, a blend of Conjure, Hoodoo, and other African Traditional Religions; including a version of the Crossroads Man/Papa Eshu. Magic flows from the moon and sun to practitioners. With white Mages & Warlocks using the less powerful Light Magic from the sun and Black & Brown Mages using the most powerful moon magic via Generational Magic. Between the two powers sits, Shadow Magic, which is practiced by Vamps. White folks have lesser magical ability but control how all magic and magical users are legislated. This is a tale of multiple families with a long, complicated, and political history. The important players are: The Vincent Family comprised of siblings Xavier & Aurora. The Beaumont Family comprised of Evelin (Reverend Mother of the Temple of Blood) & Benjamin (mayor) parents of Sophia. The Delacorte-Strayer Family comprised of Bradley & Heather (Delacorte) Strayer parents of Benjamin & Oswald. As well as Madeline Delacorte (cardinal white mage).The Savant Family comprised of Arturo & Gabriela (Rosier), parents of Valentina. The Dupart-Trudeau Family comprised of Ursula, Desiree, Jacquelyn, & Rosalie Dupart, the younger sisters of Marie (Dupart) Trudeau (current Queen of the Gen Council) mother of twins Clement & Cristina.This novel has #LGBTQA+ characters and fearures non-biased representation. This story deals with the themes of justice denied and power imbalance in society and its various communities.This book is action packed and picks right up where the first novel left off. As this is such a complicated and complex story, I'd highly recommend reading the first book in this series before this novel. If you don't want to or can't, it's OK to start with this novel as much of the action from the first novel is explained eventually in this story. The magical system is further expanded in amazing ways in this novel. Cristina, Clement, and Valentina each grow along their path and develop as they are tested by the demands of their respective choices. This tells a complete story but also sets up the next and future volumes in this series. I can not wait to read book 3!Thank you to NetGalley for the opportunity to read/listen to and  this novel. All opinions and viewpoints expressed in this  are my own. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Mar 12, 2024","Mar 14, 2024","May 28, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/144743493-blood-justice

The author chooses to use mostly Chapuys as a source for Anne and decides to present her in his vThis is a somewhat hostile biography of Anne Boleyn. The author chooses to use mostly Chapuys as a source for Anne and decides to present her in his view.It's uncomfortable.Anne is regularly referred to as a concubine after her marriage to Henry, and Elizabeth is often called the bastard during her parents' actual marriage. It's bizarrely hostile.Of what value is a biography of Anne Boleyn that stresses Katherine of Aragon & Mary Tudor's point of view???This is beyond a balanced look.The author passes the usual sexist nonsense about Anne Boleyn but packages it ludicrously as if Anne was a 'modern' feminist.I find it weird that a modern view is that Anne simply should've given up her future as a wife to be a mistress to Henry VIII out of misplaced loyalty to Katherine of Aragon.It's just a silly opinion.Anne was within her rights to refuse to sleep with the same King who fucked her sister. It's just ridiculous to suggest otherwise.People outside of a marriage do not need to prioritize or respect another couples marriage. They are free to make choices that benefit them solely. To suggest otherwise is just childish.Anne had no power to tell Henry to leave her alone and the history agrees she wanted to marry Henry Percy.She made lemonade out of the lemons Henry gave her.Anne is blamed for Henry's own behavior towards and treatment of both Katherine of Aragon & Mary Tudor.Which is bullshit. Henry was an ass to Mary after he murdered Anne. So clearly Anne wasn't influencing him from her grave.Henry murdered Margaret Pole and her whole family in a fit of horrible pique. She was his mothers cousin and friend. She was involved in raising him. He murdered her children and grandchildren, tried to genocide her whole family.He is sick as fuck and I hate that Anne has somehow more responsible for Henry being unfaithful than he's held accountable for.It's basically told from Katherine & Mary's pov until Henry dies.Then Mary is increasingly marginalized in favor of Elizabeth I's great rise. Meh.This is a biased and limited view of these dynamic women.I found much of the ways Elizabeth carried her mother into her adult life touching.At the same time this author is so biased I don't completely trust her narrative...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"May 18, 2023","May 27, 2023","May 16, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/62983579-anne-boleyn-elizabeth-i

Because I've been asked about this: Ms. Quinn's quote is, ""I don't think Black people fit in my stories because I write happy endings only."" The suggestion by her being that stories with Black folks in them can't be happy. Sitting at the same table with her was Beverly Jenkins who famously writes historical romance with Black main characters that are extremely happy and end on a high note. Of the Bridgerton novels, my favorite books are Anthony & Kate's story in The Viscount Who Loved Me. I adore Kate. Also liked Benedict & Sophie's story in An Offer From a Gentleman. I actually liked them both in this novel.I loathe Colin & Penelope's story. I detested the way Colin treated Penelope. I also hated the message, which seemed to suggest that women need to shrink themselves in order for their longtime crush to find them worthy. That they would need to abandon their own hobbies and interests to be worthy of romantic love. Just yikes.Even more, I detest EVERYTHING about Eloise & Philip's storyline. I hate this book reveals Marina's dismal destiny. Just horrid. Philip is a turd and Eloise deserved SO much better.I've overwhelmingly preferred the changes made by the show. In fairness, I only read the books after I binged the 1st season.This book very closely followed Shonda Rhimes screenplays for the TV show, and I found that it left me free to just enjoy the story. Julia Quinn's novels are hopelessly dated. Or of the type that supports asshole romantic male love interests at the expense of the women Love Interest's growth and happiness. There's a lot of compromise and understanding, which is always required of the women love interests while the men slowly and imperfectly make tiny almost minute changes, only slightly softening their asshole behaviors. It's such a bullshit sexist outlook. These novels are written for women, why wouldn't the men be worhsipful and pleasing? I much prefer cinnamon roll style male love interests. Also, I confess that the snob in me is bothered by the errors that Quinn makes when writing the British Aristocracy.

I don't necessarily believe that Isabella was involved in the Tour de Nesle Affair and while this author doesn't agree, she does leave open the possibility and I value that.Isabella doesn't occur enough in this and that's really my only gripe.

Its not a direct continuation of Lilith's story but it allows you to see what she became and the family she builds with her Oankali mates.Akin is charming and one of my favorite characters of Butler's. This book deals with a fatal contradiction that I agree with Butler in many ways feels like its human nature.I don't agree thats our nature though. I think the last almost 600 yrs of brutality has been confused for human nature. I don't agree that white supremacy is human nature. I don't even think its a natural state for white folks. So I think this contradiction can be overcome with a honest look at who we actually are rather than the lies we ymtell ourselves.Still I would stick with the Oankali. I find the idea fascinating and always have. Review from 2020 reread:This is every bit as good as I remember. This book picks up decades after Dawn and features the first human-born male Construct. I loved Akin and his adventures. He's right about a human Akjai. We probably will destroy it but we deserve the chance. Personally I wouldn't go but I'd be more peaceful knowing humanity was continuing unaltered somewhere far away from my descendants....more,Notes are private!,0,3,6,"Jul 26, 2023May 28, 2021Feb 15, 2020Jun 22, 2018Mar 15, 1994not set","Jul 26, 2023May 28, 2021Feb 26, 2020Jun 24, 2018Mar 16, 1994not set","Mar 22, 2023",,Audible Audio,view (with text),/book/show/34506573-adulthood-rites

Much of this felt overdone and unnecessary.Why would Dora go away with Daniel after becoming engaged???? It makes literally no sense. Why doesn't Dora leave when she realizes who Jonathan is???? Again, Dora's behaviors feel nonsensical and manufactured. She's a sex worker but is drinking while working and in an unsafe situation?

Today, the Palace has given an update on its progress, sharing that it now has 9.6% of employees from ethnic minority backgrounds with a target of 10% by the end of this year.'https://www.townandcountrymag.com/soc...In 2011 about 80% of the UK population was listed as white British, I think 85% of the population as white period. So I think a 10% rate of diversity at the Palace *is* reflective of society at large and that its failed to happen before now *is* a reflection on racism within in the Monarchial system. It's not even unconscious. It was a policy. So it's operated as a racist institution within fairly recent decades.Because institutions that aren't racist don't have policies restricting employees based on race.These are not complicated concepts folks.British reactions to Black US Soldiers during WW2 in rebuttal to the idea that the late Queen Lizzie II was 'a product of her times'.Cause no the fuck she wasn't.This is the 40's and she was alive during this period.https://theconversation.com/black-tro...This isn't directly related but is fascinating nonetheless.https://academic.oup.com/restud/artic...Not to mention why should Elizabeth II be head of state to nations with POC populations if she's racist against the people of the nations that she's head of? That's gross and disgusting and a reflection of her character or lack thereof.She was a racist.The institution she headed is racist.Her family is racist.These are all verifiable facts.The gaslighting is ridiculous and tiresome.Next the vilification of Meghan. The author spends so much time on the fake bullying complaints against Meghan. This is after chronicling that Queen Elizabeth II's father hit his staff, physically struck them.King Charles III threw stuff at his staff.Prince Andrew, Princess Margaret and Prince Philip are all also noted with specific and horrific examples of being cruel and verbally abusive to staff.None of these Royals have HR complaints against them.The complaints about Meghan are largely her being firm and direct. None of the comments are cruel or verbally abusive. So the HR complaint is clearly racism.I also think it's manufactured.Kensington Palace, The Cambridges using Jason Knauf have been steadily leaking false stories about Meghan. They did so in exchange for the press not printing the stories of William's affair with Rose.To downplay the fact that Prince Andrew raped an underage sex trafficking victim. So if Meghan was formally accused of anything during that time period it would've been leaked to the tabloids.The first story to break in regards to bullying was Wills bullying Harry at the Sandringham Summitt which Harry confirmed was true.Conveniently right before Meghan & Harry could have their Oprah interview the palace came up with bullying claims.It's laughably ridiculous.Just a paper thin bullshit defense.Valentine refuses to deal with Meghan's racist experiences in the UK and with the Palace. He ignores that the Queen herself was racist so it's not a stretch that her staff and family are as well.He pretends that she 'wanted to be rejected' this is a common claim when dealing with racism.It's similar to claims of race baiting.It's just a flex of white supremacy.If a POC/BAME experiences racism it can only get better by pointing this out and educating the offender.Instead the offender pretends to be the victim and claims that marginalized folks are too sensitive or think everything is racism.The thing is everything in the Western Wirld runs on racism. When a POC/BAME points racism out and asks directly for accommodations that's not a fault with the POC/BAME, that's a fault with the system.Claims that POC/BAME want to be rejected or were looking for racism are just racists themselves trying to silence their victims. Those racists feel like they get to be the deciders of what is racism and who is a victim.These are the same people who pass literal white comfort bills in which it's against the law to state historical facts that hurt white people's feelings.No shit.So clearly the problem is racism.It's exhausting.Meghan left.She's not tied to y'all, accepts no money from y'all and STILL y'all can't move on.It's only racism that makes white people behave in such violent and nonsensical ways.Meghan has more death threats than all members of the British Royal Family combined. Her children have public death threats.Something that no one else in the royal family is facing or has ever faced.Her concerns were real, valid and logical.Instead of making common sense changes the UK ran her out the country.Now they're mad that she's not just letting them tell the story from their point of view.The thing is Fergie & Diana experienced some of what Meghan's dealt with. It's well documented. Rather than grow, adjust and learn from the past, the family has now openly associated itself with racism and is considered globally a racist family.A charge the family can't deny, deflect or pretend isn't real.Honestly this will age poorly. This is about race and in 20 yrs Black people will still be here, still talking about race.This was studied formally and scientifically.Meghan is being attacked because of her race. It's not a question.The Palace also used race against Meghan.The impact of this is ALREADY being felt in the Commonwealth.It's going to get worse.Meghan was a chance for the royal family to make visible substantive changes.Instead Wills & Kate were jealous and threatened by Meghan's popularity.So they worked to destroy her in the press while she was pregnant.William is an asshole.Not sure how he's gonna argue he's not racist when he failed to speak against the racism inflicted on his own sister in law, nephew and niece.He WILL have to respond and answer at some point.This will impact his reign for sure and most likely his father's reign as well.Stop acting like the Sussex's giving interviews and writing books is betrayal.King Charles III participated in a biography and televised interview with Dimbleby.Princess Diana did the book with Morton and interview with Bashir.Fergie wrote a biography and gave a televised interview to Oprah.Prince Andrew has given more than 1 horrible interview.In all of the above instances the Royals both complained and explained repeatedly.So it just bothers the British public with Harry and Meghan for clearly racial reasons.The hardest is the author acknowledges that the staff knew about Meghan's suicidal struggles. He claims the palace staff didn't believe her. He claims they feared she was using it to be able to later say the job broke her.Here's where that defense falls apart: if she was always going to use this as a weapon against the institution wouldn't it have made more sense to get her help? Then the institution would have evidence of their support.Instead they chose not to believe her. Even though Diana, Fergie and others who married into family have found the experience overwhelming and it impacted their mental health.So why would Meghan not be believed?Because she was Black.The institution had already decided that they would let her know if she was REALLY feeling suicidal, they would let her know If the vitriol was REALLY racism or just her own fault for being American. This is epic level gaslighting. It's bullying and abusive as fuck.The staff risked her and Archie's death from mental illness all because they were too racist to listen to an educated, successful career woman in her mid 30's. Clearly Meghan and Harry HAD to leave. The Monarchy isn't ready for them yet.Their treatment will impact the Monarchy much more than it will harm them.After all the monarchy has to make a case for its relevance. At this point Meghan & Harry are just socialites & philanthropists. They don't need to do anything more than The Clinton's or The Obama's do.This bothers the racist so much. This is why the harass the fuck out of Meghan until even her son has had public death threats.The British Press is abusive and they work hand in hand with the monarchy.This will have to be answered and British folks gone be so fucking embarrassed by their rabidly racist behavior.Bet it's the same racist talking heads belittling them now, apologizing and trying to explain.White mediocrity is so incredibly predictable.TL/DR: this is fascinating but racist as fuck...more",Notes are private!,1,17,1,"Dec 14, 2022","Dec 18, 2022","Dec 14, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/61782080-courtiers

It was divided into 3 parts: childhood, soldiering & Meghan.I believe utterly that this is Harry's view of what haWhew, there's a lot in this memoir. It was divided into 3 parts: childhood, soldiering & Meghan.I believe utterly that this is Harry's view of what happened. I believe just as fully both his brother & father would have many corrections to this narrative. I think we do hear from the family in the press, especially his Dad (Pa) & Camilla, indirectly, which is cowardly.I believe 100% that William made the comment about the color of Archie's skin, though the memoir never addresses it.One of the largest surprises was that William and Harry basically have had a nonexistent relationship since before Diana died.Long before Will met Kate and Harry met Meghan. Their fractured relationship really has nothing to do with either wife.The 2nd largest surprise was the sheer level of animosity William appears to have harbored for Harry, which is suggested to have begun in their childhood. Maybe sibling rivalry exacerbated by trauma? It comes off as incredibly petty given how much more money and power William has.William is an incredible bully. He never ever defends Harry but does call on him for help when he's being bullied by mutual friends of theirs.Harry longs for a deeper connection to his big brother, but Will honestly wants nothing to do with him. Their relationship is so distant that Harry & Will go on tour or engagement in Lesotho together after Will has become engaged privately to Kate. Will never even mentioned it to Harry. Harry finds out when it's published in the papers with the rest of the world.Also the family is so fucking cold that Harry's never hugged his own grandparents. It's implied he's never hugged his father's siblings either. Like you could melt ice on the asses of these cold hearted folks.I don't even understand this kinda relationship. Bizarre and unhealthy.That weird story in the press about Harry inheriting his mom's engagement ring and Wills having to ask for it to pop the question to Kate are all lies. The brothers also weren't each others best men at their respective weddings, just more lies for the press.I was surprised that Meghan's TV show had to have her scenes and dialogue approved by the palace before filming.Meghan was a fiance, not a wife, and already, her entire life was pretty much dictated by royal advisors at a palace she didn't even receive support from.Both Harry and the late Queen seemed surprised that Harry needed permission to marry Meghan. This felt odd to me as I fucking know this. How do actual family members not? The Queen didn't know which family members needed her permission to marry? Charles III does indeed suggest that he has no money to support Meghan after years of speaking about a 'slimmed down monarchy including his son's and their families'. This is shortly after setting up a trustfund for his Stepkids, Camilla’s children from her first marriage. The leaking between the palaces was harrowing. The Queen leaks against her family. Charles leaks against his sons. William leaks against Harry. Harry goes public with private family knowledge in puzzling and unnecessary detail.This entire family is a fucking mess.Harry is relatable with all his cannabis consumption, psychedlic and recreational drug use, drinking etc. He even used a tank of laughing gas when Meghan was in labor with Archie which I felt was a bit unacceptable. He talks about his penis, the todger, more than I'd like.Camilla suggested to Meg that Harry become the Governor General of Bermuda as they're having trouble with press when their relationship first goes public. This is before they're even engaged. So, the plan was always for them to scuttle off out of the limelight.Meg and Charles seem to get along well. Wills is put off Meg hugged him and didn't bow. Kate is unbalanced by Meg's Americanness. It's mostly manufactured nonsense.The ludicrous disagreements between Kate & Meghan are very high school mean girl- esque. I don't understand why Kate can't speak up if she's upset about the hormone cooment? It's weird on multiple levels to call a meeting and demand an apology months later. Just weird.Wills gets confrontational with Meghan and she tells him politely to get his finger out of her face; suddenly Will hates Meg.Wills struggles to control his temper in much of this narrative. He's petty, mean, bullying and fragile as spun glass. The so-called 'Sandringham Summitt' was a joke. Before the meeting started the Queen's office had already drafted a press release saying Harry & Meghan were leaving.So the 5 options offered were never real options. Harry was effectively kicked out of the family.He was promised security and continued financial support for a year.It turns out that too was a lie.Security was removed suddenly and without advance warning.His own father wouldn't even take his calls regarding this.Then they moved to Tyler Perry's house but quickly needed to get their own set up and right then Charles cuts off financial help.It's clear the family was trying to bully them back to the palace.See, removing security is what got Diana killed, no two ways about it. Her security detail would've never allowed what happened to her to happen.Charles knew that and William knew that. Not to mention his own Grandmother, the Queen.I'm shocked they gave so few fucks.Like whoa.Harry & Meghan's threat level was equal to the Queens. Higher than any other member of the family and still his own father didn't fight his loss of security or pay to replace it.The base toxicity in misusing power so oppressively. Then the epic level gaslighting to back it up.Shit with family like this, who needs enemies? I see why the couple is doing TV shows and writing books. Their security costs are outrageous, Harry has no marketable skills and little education. Meghan was basically a cable actress and only on 1 show at that.I would assume Meghan could get tons of work, but Harry is uncomfortable with her romantic scenes. I also think it is a class issue with their current titles and roles.So they sell access to their experiences, and honestly, I'm not mad at them. I think they are desperately trying to secure enough resources to raise their kids safely. They are also continuing philanthropic work which isn't as helpful as most think but can be noble I guess. Philanthropy is largely a tax haven but I digress.At the same time, even after comparing his family to a death cult, Harry doesn't denounce monarchy. He gives a couple 'lip service' passages to the evils of colonialism, but overall, he's a proud Brit and a monarchist.I didn't expect anything less, and that's truthfully why I pirated this book. The Royals are OG colonists. I'm never willingly giving them money.I wish Harry & Meghan and their little family the best. Meghan's the best thing that ever happened to Harry. They're a great couple and a happy family.They would've been a huge asset to Charles III and I do think in time their experiences will have a detrimental impact on the monarchy as an institution. The racism is obvious and epic. It will continue to echo through The Commonwealth. Ah may it all end soon:)I'd give this a 3.75 probably rounded to a 4 but given the racists have been bombing the s I feel.honor bound to counteract that with a 5 star rating....more",Notes are private!,2,400,1,"Jan 09, 2023","Jan 11, 2023","Dec 06, 2022",,Audible Audio,view (with text),/book/show/63112750-spare

I would expect a woman historian to be less sexist but I've noticed this bullshit sexist treatment of Anne Boleyn is standard amongst British Historians.Sigh.This was a complete waste of my time.I don't know anything more about Jane than I knew before reading this hagiographical nonsense passed off as an actual biography....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Oct 14, 2022","Oct 18, 2022","Oct 14, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/19321390-jane-seymour

Henry VIII is a figure much mythologized and romanticized and I expect his biographer to go beyond & beneath that. To my disappointment I found this biographer was primarily interested in upholding the myth while applying few unavoidable consequences of our current slightly less sexist view of history.Painfully out of touch...more,Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Oct 11, 2022","Oct 11, 2022","Oct 11, 2022",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/58938197-henry-viii

For example this only briefly covers Henry III through Edward III because there aren't lost heirs from that period. I mean like a paragraph mention before jumping to Edward the Black Prince. There's discussion of the sons of William the Conqueror which may be confusing if one isn't that familiar with how that story plays out.

The 'poorest' amongst this group own land and in some cases businesses, struggling but still. So this isn't a class statement as this is between the solidly, comfortably middle class and the wealthy. No one in this book has ever dealt with food or housing insecurity. There's no poverty, just wealthy by birth and comfortable by birth. The comfortable never seem to notice or acknowledge how very lucky they are compared to the actual food & housing insecure.That's important because when you look at the 'tragedy' element of this story with the consequences ultimately paid by the participants and then compare it to how the US justice system hunts and enslaves Black & Brown kids like, Kalief Browder, the idea that this is a look at different classes falls extremely flat. Look up sentences for very minor crimes for Black folks, most especially in small all white affluent communities like the one in this story and you might find that in that same little town actual injustice was likely taking place, it just wasn't included in this story or even acknowledged. In order to discuss 'class' in the US race has to be at the center, not the periphery of the story. To tackle 'class', the story would need to feature actual poverty not the threat of losing property ownership. I grew up in Detroit in the 80's. I know folks who did more than 10 yrs in prison for less than an oz of cannabis. Nothing that happened in this novel wasn't wildly privileged for ALL parties involved from my Black ass perspective.It's so interesting to me how white folks in the US seem to almost live in an altered version of reality in which this is a tragedy because from my perspective these are major wins for everyone compared to what I've experienced and seen those around me experience when dealing with the justice system. My daughter got a yr probation over a fucking speeding ticket, in a fully insured legal car, no drugs, no alcohol, no weapons, not even a reckless driving charge, no driving while under the influence, no accident, no one harmed; just a cop who saw a young Black girl in an all white area and a judge that decided she 'looked' like she wasn't taking her speeding ticket seriously enough. It was a fucking nightmare. So these kids causing half a million dollars worth of damage while committing a crime and the way this worked out was a gift and everyone involved was unbelievably fucking privileged and a bunch of whiners to boot.Whew.Also I worked in sales outside of Detroit, MI in 2008. I watched that financial crisis happen in real time and many of my contemporaries lost their homes. Some were able to pick up cheap homes during this time.No one I know has recovered financially. The impact was unbelievable. I worked in a very affluent and wealthy area and it was unsettling to watch how families were impacted.To have adults begging me to let them out of contracts.I had folks with Phd's applying for part time stock positions.It was harrowing and brutal.Our company downsized and I barely made the cut.Shortly thereafter I became too disabled to work but many of my Black Gen X contemporaries were wiped out financially with no retirement to speak of.It was awful.I remarried in 2010 and left the US. I don't know what happened as I haven't much kept in contact but I heard that covid shenanigans by the company were brutal for employees. I was in sales management. 2008 was a stressful awful year and I was employed. I can remember a company we did business with laying off their whole staff before Thanksgiving. Everyone was in tears, the company was being liquidated. It was just a brutal time. I don't want to spoil the details but I like the way the story was handled. It reminded me of a limited series Law & Order spin off. I don't watch anymore but I used to watch pretty much every spin off and the original. Now I want police abolished and prison ended so I tend to stay away from cop propaganda TV. Still this reminded me in the best ways of that show. Though the cops are relatively minor characters.I will definitely read another novel by this author....more",Notes are private!,2,25,1,"Sep 23, 2022","Sep 23, 2022","Sep 23, 2022",,Audiobook,view (with text),/book/show/62616555-the-house-party

Her tone, inflection and pronunciation were ideal for this story. I appreciated the use of different tones and accents to differentiate between characters. I'll be seeking out novels narrated by Natalie Simpson in the future. This is a young adult thriller. Sade is a new student at Alfred Noble Academy. She's all alone, her mother died some years ago, her father died more recently. As to her life before Alfred Noble Academy, we know she was homeschooled and not allowed much freedom. Upon her fathers death, Sade enrolled herself at an exclusive, expensive boarding school and started her new life.Because Sade doesn't start at school until grade 11 or her junior year, her new student experience is somewhat unique. The physical school campus is described in vivid and atmospheric detail making it almost an unofficial character in the novel.The primary side characters are students Basil, Elizabeth & Persephone with a much larger cast of students, teachers and administrators. I loved the set up of the school, the dorm naming theme, the cliques, etc. The world building was immersive and engaging.This novel explores trauma in a meaningful and frank manner: sexual assault, suicide, bullying and the resulting trauma are all explored in the novel. I found the handling of characters with PTSD heartbreakingly realistic. There's so much story here I think upon a future reread I'll find clues and information I overlooked upon this initial read. I'm impressed as not all YA novels have this much depth or dexterity in the handling of heavy subjects like this.This is deep but not depressing. The story actively engages the reader's thinking brain but doesn't leave the reader feeling disturbed. The trauma doesn't come into play until after at least 1 or 2 reveals. I had read this author's debut novel, Ace of Spades, a couple of years ago and could not put it down. I was not disappointed with this second novel.

The Ladies are a diverse bunch from diverse backgrounds, and all of that functions very smoothly as part of the story. There's a lesbian love story, which is sweet and not overwhelming in the story. Sometimes the romance elements can overtake the story but this is very balanced and almost background to the rest of the story.As with all things Titanic, there's sadness and a feeling of yawning waste and loss.

That losing our language and identity makes us the most 'american' but then doesn't want or views or experiences included in the American story.It's weirdly racist. Like he wants to credit Black culture that resulted in Jazz, Rap, Hip-hop, etc to just be credited as american with our contributions diminished to not cause 'division'.At the same time he feels like manifest destiny was true, that white men -specifically the descendants of anglo saxons- are the creators of the western world solely, and to be given credit for inventions that weren't theirs, Iike Jazz. But at the same time to be absolved of responsibility for the same aspects he's so proud of.So which is it????If manifest destiny is right and slavery and colonialism are okay because Europeans built roads and indoctrinated the globe in xtianity, then the problems that resulted from these policies also belong to anglo saxons, right? So that makes them RESPONSIBILE for the actions of their predecessors. Which this author feels is divisive.He just wants to be praised and not critiqued and it reads as fragile, ridiculous and immature.This book exists as a response to 'Afrocentric' history. The forerunner to the current 1619 Project.I'd say that Afrocentric History taught to Black folks in the 80's & 90's is likely why we have the 1619 Project today.Unlike Afrocentric History which was taught primarily to Black students in Black school districts, the 1619 Project has a global and national audience.It's being taught from pre K thru university level. I mean racists are really upset about it but it's happening regardless.So for those that think white folks losing their shit over 'critical race theory' is new, nope, same shit different decade.This author hasn't been liberal in decades before he wrote this.However his views track as mostly liberal.I appreciate that because it's important for BIPOC folks to remember that white liberals are often lying about their antiracist feelings, in their heart beats an unredeemable racist.Always a good reminder.This book contradicts itself in multiple places and largely functions as an angry rant that white anglo saxons created our society. They created the worst, most oppressive parts of it for sure. Pretty sure that's not what he meant but that's all I got for him.This is old and dated so hopefully the author is dead and suffered while he died...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Aug 09, 2022","Aug 09, 2022","Aug 09, 2022",,Audiobook,view (with text),/book/show/11644758-the-disuniting-of-america

Her mother, The Duchess of Bedford was a leading lady in Queen Margaret of Anjou's Court. Queen Margaret was related to Jacquetta, perhaps only by marriage but that was sufficient in that time period for strong kinship ties. As a result Jacquetta's children were able to make fairly decent marriages based on the status of their mother and their ability to leverage the family's closeness to the Queen. This is before Edward IV is King, just under Henry VI & Margaret of Anjou. The Woodville's weren't simple country squires at all. Lord Rivers was already a Baron under Henry VI. The research by the author is poor and likely biased.While it's true that Elizabeth Woodville's father was simply a Baron and the 1st Baron Rivers to boot, her mother was not. Her mom was Jacquetta of Luxembourg a part of the French Royal family. Jacquetta comes to England as a teenage bride to John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford who was the Uncle of King Henry VI and highly placed at Court in England. Jacquetta keeps her Royal title as The Duchess of Bedford during her marriage with Richard Woodville.Jacquetta's connections to Luxembourg via the Duke of Burgundy are why Edward IV makes deals with Burgundy over the King of France. At this time dealing with the Duke of Burgundy is probably a stronger position that dealing directly with the King of France who is already protecting and housing Queen Margaret and her son, Edward the former Prince of Wales. With that in mind it's easy to see why Edward IV chose to make deals with Burgundy instead. It doesn't excuse him embarrassing Warwick but would bolster my belief that Warwick was trying to control Edward IV. This is a very complicated time in politics and the author chooses to totally omit the French Civil War taking place at this time and instead just pretend that Edward IV made poor choices while chasing his penis. There's strategy at play here and the French Civil War would need make this story much more complicated but also much more historically accurate.Edward IV was never faithful to Elizabeth so it's doubtful that sex with her was why he made the choices he made.In fact there's little evidence that Edward IV was influenced by Elizabeth Woodville in regards to her family. Weakening The Neville family's hold over Edward IV and Court made sense and was most likely why Edward IV promoted The Woodville's like he did.Also Iggulden's research is faulty as fuck because Anthony Woodville had already made a good marriage and become Lord Scales BEFORE Elizabeth became Queen. Anthony Woodville was also highly educated, extremely religious and well respected across Western Europe. He had traveled to multiple Royal European Courts and even spent time in Rome. He was highly educated and deeply respected in his time.This series mostly focuses on battles and it's mostly very slow because of this....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jul 25, 2022","Jul 29, 2022","Jul 25, 2022",,Audio CD,view (with text),/book/show/29653795-bloodline

The bottom line is this isn't written by a historian. Its written by a very prominent ricardian.It's sloppy, messy, biased, cherry picks sources, lacks common sense and critical thinking.This is a vanity project by the author and is unbelievably biased which the author fails to acknowledge.It's natural to have an opinion. I prefer history books that state the authors opinion clearly. What's not okay is to have a bias, fail to acknowledge that bias or the other in fact more widely accepted viewpoint.I literally don't understand ricardians attachment to this outdated nonsense thinking. The facts, such as they are, simply don't support the idea that Richard III is an innocent. He stole the throne from his nephews which was unnecessary.He murdered his step-nephew on a thin pretext.Richard III wasn't Lord Protector when he arrested Anthony Woodville & Richard Grey, so they could plan against him if they wished. Edward IV named him as Protector on his death bed but at this time in England the kings wishes died with him. It was for the council to determine if Richard was Lord Protector and as he hadn't yet arrived in London, that formality hadn't been completed. So the Woodville's could plot against him and because they were also royal and titled nobility he'd have had to charge them in front of their peers and they were legally allowed a defense. Richard murders them extra judicially. On a very thin pretext that they were plotting against him in general. It's poorly done. Anthony Woodville was his brother-in-law and Richard Grey was his step-nephew. These facts aren't even in question.In addition there's the murder of Hastings on an even bigger pretext. Its clear, even to ricardians, that Richard III only murdered Hastings because he was too loyal to Edward IV to allow his sons throne to be stolen. Again this fact isn't in dispute even by Ricardians. Richard feared, with real basis, that once his nephew the King was old enough to rule on his own he would get revenge on Richard III for his treatment of his Woodville relatives. This was probably true. However, Richard always had the option of being kind to the King's Woodville relatives and avoiding this eventuality. Furthermore, I believe that Richard planned to steal the throne when he first set out from the North to crown Edward V and accept his role on the Council. He didn't have his wife join him for the scheduled coronation of Edward V. In my eyes he already had decided to steal the throne. He was feeling out his options and seeing if he had support. Queen Elizabeth Woodville seems to have been wary of Richard with good cause. I hate that her flight to sanctuary is used as proof *she* had nefarious intentions instead of proof she read Richard III correctly. She seemed to understand the York boys better than they understand themselves.Even if Richard III didn't order the murder of his nephews, which I personally believe he carried out himself much like I think Edward IV murdered Henry VI personally, he's still responsible for their murder.He took his nephew Richard, the spare, from Elizabeth Woodville in sanctuary and refused her request to have both of her boys with her. He insisted he could and would keep her sons safe. He surrounded the church she was living in with soldiers, threatening to violate sanctuary if she didn't give him her son. She capitulated, probably to keep her other children safe, a Medieval version of 'Sophie's Choice' and she's blamed for this. The sexism is ridiculous and gross.As soon as Richard III had both Princes in his custody he announced he was the rightful king. Sure sounds like a setup. Like he wanted to secure his control of both boys BEFORE openly making a grab for the throne. After Richard III successfully stole the throne, he did not return the 'bastard' Princes to the care of their mother. Why? She was effectively in custody and marginally under his control in Sanctuary. If he meant the boys no harm as their loving uncle and HAD to reluctantly take the throne, why didn't he return the boys to their mother in sanctuary? Or take the whole family and place them under his control together? He had already violated sanctuary by insisting Prince Richard be put in his custody or else.Richard III made himself responsible for the care of his nephews, the Princes, against the wishes of their only living parent.As King, Uncle and the man in charge, he's responsible for what happened under his rule whether he was directly responsible or not. I mean of course he killed the princes, no one stood to gain as much as he did.There's also the deathbed confession, as presented by Sir Thomas More. I don't believe Sir More can be dismissed as a Tudor propagandist. He was famously religious and stubborn. That doesn't make his research accurate but I doubt very much he passed baseless propaganda off as truth....more",Notes are private!,1,9,1,"Jun 15, 2022","Jun 15, 2022","Jun 15, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/35992695-richard-iii

That said this is a scholarly biography and not the fashionable biographies with questionable claims and few sources. Those can be fun to read but rarely offer real research and tend to continue popular misconceptions.My only disagreement would be that Edward II did not die when he was deposed.

Her acquisition of property is brutal and there's no reason to believe that the worst of her henchmen were acting on other than her orders, since according to the author, Eleanor was a micromanager of her business affairs.I also am uncomfortable at the normalizing of clear antisemitism, such as Edward I having the English Jewish Community wear 'badges' to inform on their status. Yes, that's highly antisemitic. Even though other European leaders acted the same that doesn't lessen this as horribly antisemitic.The author feels to me too attached to the subject to make reasonable assumptions.

I was unimpThis was poorly paced and I didn't like how it was organized either.This starts off with heiresses from famous fictional books and movies. I was unimpressed. Even after it slowly gets to the point far too often fictional heiresses are referenced in annoying and frankly puzzling ways. The author both states that money would change her life and increase her happiness AND that money had no impact on heiresses lives because of lack of frame of reference or want. I don't like the idea that poverty and struggle build character especially when we know what it builds is trauma. Also wealth does create happiness. Turns out the ability to afford to live increases base happiness. We've known this for decades.Much like white privilege doesn't guarantee a life of comfort devoid of struggle, rather it denotes a life free from the negative impact of race. The same is true with wealth, it offers a life in which finances aren't a concern, not guarantees a life with zero struggles. Still money buys a lot of power and prestige in our society and that creates an affluent life. No one is guaranteed happiness and frankly if these heiresses were miserable their wealth was certainly causing misery for many others in support of their life of privilege. At least in the hundreds just for their everyday home, clothing, food and childcare. Now add in the employees of their various wealth producing sources and the misery is spread to thousands if not tens of thousands. But sure, a rich heiress enjoying every physical comfort money could buy was unhappy so let's justify that feeling with poor little rich girl bullshit.Rich people create poverty because their wealth depends on not fairly compensating labor, instead paying as little or nothing if they can get away with it. These women had servants who labored and toiled, many not even allowed to marry or date and were paid a pittance. I bet they lived unhappy lives without physical comfort of any sort too. They were certainly being used by the heiresses in this book.I find this to be a white feminist view of history in which we remove the actual power of white women because they did not have as much power as white men. They still had more power than pretty much everyone else in society who wasn't white, including men of color. It's like when we focus the gender pay gap on how white women are paid less than white men and ignore that those same white women out earn most folks of color independent of their gender.White women have ALWAYS only been devoid of power in comparison to white men but consistently this narrative ignores the plight of EVERYONE else.This book fails in that exact same way.The author seems to think that rich women are the only women used or chosen for something other than themselves and frankly that's bullshit. Folks of modest or limited means are used for how they look, for their lowered value in the labor market, taken advantage of in many ways. In fact the poorer you are the less likely you are to be seen and acknowledged by society at large much less chosen for yourself. Lol what fucking romantic nonsense.Being used for money isn't any worse than being used for looks or knowledge or labor or physical strength, etc. Often historians maintain this idea that rich or titled people are uniquely misunderstood by modern society but on the contrary I'd say the western world spends most of its historical space devoted to the lives of the rich and famous very much to the expense of both history and average every day folks.Also this historian uses the slur 'g#*sy' which is uncalled for and unacceptable but most importantly given the claims of the author, not feminist....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Mar 31, 2022","Mar 31, 2022","Mar 31, 2022",,Audiobook,view (with text),/book/show/60010607-heiresses

The author makes the case John was 'an atheist' but I'm not sure I agree. This is based on John's impatience and irreverence for The Catholic Church but perhaps the ritual nonsense bothered him without him not believing in God entirely. I don't know that seems extreme for that time period.Somewhat sexist view of women covered in this history. He also passes on many exaggerations that have already been explained, such as Richard I's homosexuality. It's possible he was bisexual but we can't really deduce that from existing info. He had illegitimate children and 'sodomy' didn't only mean anal sex at the time he confessed to it, it could cover various what were considered sexual depravities. Sharing a bed with another man, crying, hugging etc were normal at the time Richard I lived and not an indicator of homosexuality, nor is it an indicator of homosexuality now.

This includes letters written to family members, a bit about her childhood, her family and tracks her career as a painter before her writing career.This also tracks her heartbreakingly short career.I don’t know if it's accurate but I liked the picture of her being uncooperative with the press and repeatedly lying about her age and background. What a character.I think there's a sexist and ableist treatment of her by Neiderman in his obsession with and insistence on stressing her presumed innocence and virginity. He repeatedly characterizes her as a stunted adult or teenager who never grew up despite the darkness of her work or its incredibly adult subject matter. Not to mention the author was middle aged when published.Often disabled people are seen as childlike or innocent. Perhaps Virginia was, though her writing belies that definition, but I believe the assertion to be based upon her disability and likely her race. The purity of white women is a huge big deal in the western world.Certainly there is no way to know what experiences she may have had before her life becomes restricted by her mother and health around age 17. She had a boyfriend when she her condition worsens and which her mother subsequently runs off. Many of the characters in her books experience their first sexual exploration before the age of 17 so perhaps she did too. Either way I found this focus somewhat salacious and overly colored by sexism & ableism.I enjoyed the most Obsessed, the original unedited uncompleted story written by Virginia and included with this biography.This doesn't have much valuable info that's not already included in previously published interviews and while it does include some family letters, nothing of real importance is added.Spoilers for those who are intetested but don't want to bother with the book:Virginia is from a working class family, she was an art prodigy and took community college art classes in grade school.She probably had a chronic condition that was exacerbated by a 'twist' in high school. This causes arthritis which has terrible pain. This led to multiple Dr visits, specialist appointments and surgeries. One such surgery followed by a full body cast leaves her needing to use crutches & a wheelchair for mobility permanently. After her father's death she and her mother Lilian who provides all of her physical care live with relatives. Virginia sells artwork for awhile to help make ends meet. She always wants to write and eventually quits painting full time to pursue writing.She read and studied extensively which forced her to increase her families library as reference books can't be checked out. Her mother never reads her books but is horrified at the incest in Flowers.Cathy from Flowers was based heavily on Virginia and carries many of her skills and aspects of her personality probably.Flowers in the Attic is worked from the story of a young Dr she met who she was sweet on and he was sweet on her when she was dealing with medical troubles. He told her he was from an influential family and had to be hidden for 6 years due to issues with inheritance. Almost 30 yrs later that will become Flowers in the Attic.She had approval power over the script for Flowers in the Attic movie, visited the set, spoke with actors and even filmed a cameo for the film. She quite liked the casting.She writes a sweet letter in 1983 leaving everything to her mom which must be when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. In the novel, Heaven, Kitty dies of breast cancer which she refused to acknowledge or treat. I think it likely Virginia chose the same as according to Neiderman there's no record of chemo or radiation therapy. Virginia doesn't do much writing towards the end of her life though supposedly she did stay awake writing out ideas for future books and had presumably saved that.I assume this is what Neiderman works from in part anyway.Maybe worth a read for serious fans but not much here of value...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,Apr 2022,Apr 2022,"Jan 27, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58438633-the-woman-beyond-the-attic

It's brutal and horrible and I believe that her rapist was a Black man.Unfortunately the author harbors internalized white supremacy or fragility which makes her unable to tell the differences between Black folks.The author is fully aware of this and more or less has a Black man arrested for speaking to her in the streets. He lost 16 yrs of his life to prison and while he was able to find a woman who believed him and married, he never had children because of this false accusation and his desire not to harm his own theoretical kids by being their father.This  exists because the publisher refuses to alter this book, even after this man has been found innocent and the court apologized for his wrongful imprisonment.I believe that the author meant no malice and probably has convinced herself that this man is her rapist. She clearly needs a therapist that is prepared to handle her racism, however unconscious because this is nonsense.I hope the victim of her biased, racist FALSE accusation sues her for her profits made by victimizing him.I have considerably less pity for the brutality that Alice Sebold experienced since she seems to think it is no big deal to enact violence on a Black man for the crime of speaking to her in the street.""...Scribner has no plans to update the text of Lucky at this time,"" a representative for the book publisher tells EW in a statement.""https://ew.com/books/rape-conviction-......more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,not set,not set,"Nov 27, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/82970.Lucky

Europe during this period can't be removed from its colonizing actions abroad as that informed the behaviors in Europe and vice versa.This book ignores that and treats Europe as if it grew in isolation which is ahistorical.The information on Marie Antoinette, Louis XVI and the French Revolution is incorrect or mis-stated in multiple places and multiple ways. There's also goofy shit like the argument that Russia is an Asiatic country solely because the Mongol Empire acted as overlord to white europeans of Danish descent who sat the throne in Rus, now Russia.This ignores that what is now Spain was controlled for 600 yrs by Islamic North Africans, notice the Iberian Peninsula is not considered Asiatic nor African.These ideas are biased and largely based in eugenicist mythology.Its interesting that every European country and system of government is compared to the USA. However the USA isn't a democracy before 1865 full stop and arguably not a democracy after. The country is founded as an oligarchy with only white land owning men voting and with the Electoral College protecting against true democracy.The info on Napoleon is goofy, he did not revolutionize anything, he was a well organized tyrant.Nazi's kept excellent records but it doesn't change their crimes.Somehow for Napoleon his 'codes' negate the chaos and tyranny of his fucked up rule.

White feminist politics produces the fantasy of a common, even uniform, identity of Woman, a morally upright creature whose full participation in the capitalist, white supremacist status quo will allegedly absolve it of its sins. The individual obscures the structure. Under white feminism, the goal of gender justice shrinks to defending women’s qualities and identities. The agenda today becomes empowering individual women to own their voice, refuse to be mansplained to, and embrace their right to equality with men. These are fine practices on their own, but they do not convey the devastating nature of sexism, nor do they offer realistic methods of demolishing it. In fact, fetishizing the identity of Woman as the basis of feminist politics actually makes it more difficult to recognize sexism as a structure of exploitation and extraction. For sexism is not merely the silencing, interrupting, and overlooking of women. Sexism is the use of the male/female binary as an instrument to monopolize social, political, and economic power—and those assigned female at birth are not its only victims. Consistently, white feminism wins more rights and opportunities for white women through further dispossessing the most marginalized. It seeks to install women at the helm of the systems that have brought the planet to the brink of ecological collapse and to declare the battle won, cleansed by their tears. White feminism has supported the denial of suffrage to men of color, the eradication of Native ties to land and community, eugenics, homophobia, transphobia, and neoliberal capitalism. Today, it comprises the delusions that Girl Power will solve inequality, that if the investment bank Lehman Brothers were instead Lehman Sisters we would have a better kind of capitalism, and that putting a woman in the White House will necessarily create a more moral empire. While seemingly ignoring non-middle-class white women, white feminism actually raids more marginalized groups in order to shore up its own political power. White feminism is theft disguised as liberation. Yet while white feminists attempt to win their rights and opportunities through fighting for inclusion within fundamentally unequal systems, those benefits are largely mythical, even for women as wealthy as Sheryl Sandberg. Sexism is so fully interwoven within structures of domination that the single-axis fight to support women is itself a delusion: patriarchy threads through all forms of inequality. Eradicating sexism requires unravelling the entire system.”~ Kyla Schuller, The Trouble With White Women: A Counterhistory of Feminism...more",Notes are private!,0,36,1,"Oct 13, 2021","Oct 26, 2021","Oct 09, 2021",,Audiobook,view (with text),/book/show/57007650-the-trouble-with-white-women

I found some of the suppositions and offered facts questionable and some outright wrong.For example: 'Maria Theresia was staggeringly successful at dynastic reproduction: over 19 years she gave birth to 16 children, 10 of whom lived into adulthood. One of the most remarkable things about her as a ruler was that she helped raise all these children yet wisely governed a huge monarchy at the same time.'This is not true. Maria Theresa's children didn't all live with or near her. She over saw their tutors and guardians. The oldest few had the most regular contact with her.This is standard for the times in which she lived and may have been true even if she wasn't working as monarch. Certainty her work expectations outweighed the availability to provide much personal care to her offspring.The family did have family time at holidays and vacations and MT was a caring parent.I mean for the most part anyway via the standards for the age in which she lived.Also Carlos V & Philip II are presented in a very biased and white supremacist, colonialist perspective.The author suggests that Carlos V was considered a generous ruler by his South American subjects and I know for a fact Aztec history doesn't match that description at all.It's standard in European histories to ignore the historical records of POC who were oppressed and colonized and thats racist....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Oct 05, 2021","Oct 06, 2021","Oct 05, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/22235011-habsburgs

Which is older than christianity so clearly the idea that religion changes rather than stagnating isn't new or invented by Butler and makes sense to huge swatches of society for centuries. It felt like christian bias and I have zero patience or respect for that bullshit. Too many dead bodies and raped kids on the christian religion for me to be expected to treat it respectfully. The actual bible quote was preachy and eye roll worthy.In s of fantasy, sci fi and speculative fiction I find bible quotes particularly obnoxious. Like why?

Once you have figured that out, you must find that story too. From there, you begin to get a clearer, yet still imperfect, picture."" ~ Homegoing by Yaa GyasiHistory isn't unbiased truth.Its a perspective.If the goal is to have the most complete record of what happened, history from ALL perspectives will have to be included.US History as traditionally told leaves out every perspective that isn't white and usually male. US History as a subject is SO biased and dismissive of other perspectives of history that the US has had to supplement it by adding whole 'supplemental' history months to focus on the history that's admittedly omitted from standard US history curriculum.Probably the most well known in the US is Black History Month which has had to be repeated across the Western World because white supremacy omits and warps the history of marginalized peoples everywhere it exists.I am unsure why white supremacists are shocked by the idea that the descendants of those who were enslaved by the founding oppressors, view those same founding oppressors as monsters. We are entitled to see history from our experience and perspective.This view of history is not harmful to white people as racist, white supremacist history still exists and is taught more widely. The temper tantrum over the 1619 Project is the worst part of white supremacy.Please just grow up.Your ancestors committed genocide on a mass scale and if that hurts your feelings get the fuck over it.I'm tired of the whining.Your ancestors sucked, this country was founded on oppression and still runs on it.Those facts aren't 'woke' or 'Marxist' this is history from our perspective.We're not ever going to stop telling it and eventually your descendants will have to make amends.It is what it is.This, this is just a warped, racist and white supremacist view of history.The truth can't hurt you, its just words on a page.What is omitted from this white supremacist text is that The 1619 Project was first printed in the newspaper. The newspaper has an entire department that exists solely to fact check stories before they are printed. Any errors would've been corrected and the newspaper would print retractions.History books however are only checked for spelling and other writing errors.

Now had he balanced that with a middle aged Black woman who was protesting in Detroit this would be a fair and balanced picture. Instead this guy like most conservative racists, denounces trump but excuses his blatant racism.The author under reports how many reporters, photographers and aide workers were erroneously and illegally detained by police during the protests. He ignores the multiple videos of police shooting huge rubber bullets at protestors heads. He ignores that gassing was deployed in such amounts that residential neighborhoods under covid quarantine were gassed in their closed-up homes. He ignores that police gassed a woman to death during these protests. He ignores that police force was met with protestor force but that's not the same as instigating violence.The author describes the violent insurrection on Jan 6th that leaves 5 dead as largely non-violent and mostly describes the violent mob as harmless, over-excited trump fans mostly picture and trophy taking.He fails to mention that Pelosi's office had piss & shit left on the carpets.He neglects to mention that the mob included armed members of the US armed forces and police officers from other areas participating in a coordinated and illegal attack on the federal government. The author ignores the senators hiding in fear with gas masks on. He neglects to mention that AOC was not even safe to be held with the other senators but had to be taken somewhere else because Republican senators were coordinating and cooperating with the violent insurrectionist mob. The mob who was hunting Pelosi, AOC and Pence to do violent physical harm to.He chooses not to mention the police officers who died as a result of this violence and who most definitely were harmed. We have all seen the video of the violence during the 2nd impeachment.This author ignores all of that evidence in favor of a racist reframing of this historical event.He's a fucking conservative racist asshole who makes no effort to present a fair and balanced picture of these events.He's just a trump stooge...more",Notes are private!,0,100,1,"Jul 14, 2021","Jul 14, 2021","Jul 14, 2021",,Audible Audio,view (with text),/book/show/58548900-frankly-we-did-win-this-election

I believe Jesus is likely an amalgamation of Jewish Rabbi's alive during the time period in which Jesus existed. I don't think this has any impact on christianity as a religion nor the folks who believe in and practice it.As a non-believer my opinions are of little consequence to anyone other than myself.My low rating of this book is largely due to the perpetuation of white supremacist views of colonialism & history.The catholic church blessed the acts of genocide, rape & theft as carried out across the Americas and eventually pretty much all of the continent of Africa. Millions of people died as a result; cultures, languages and lineages all lost because of the practice of violent colonialism. All sanctioned by the catholic church which grew incredibly wealthy and profited financially off of these practices.The vatican library houses the only copy of some Indigenous Peoples of South America history and beliefs as well as sacred relics. The church needs to atone for its crimes by returning what was stolen: the wealth, the history and to apologize for the churches unbelievably unchrist like behaviors and finally to pay reparations.Instead this historian just glosses over shit and gives half the story.So we learn about how Bartolomé de las Casas wrote a book and gave testimony that helps Indigenous Native Peoples in what is now Dominican Republic/Haiti stop being so exploited. I think the remaining Indigenous population is removed to somewhere in South America. I know their descendants remain.What is left out is Casas suggestion that Black West African folks be substituted as enslaved peoples to be exploited. This is after Casas understands how horribly these folks are treated. He decides in a founding principle of horrific racism that this treatment is okay for Black folks.This bullshit leads to centuries of misery for the Black Diaspora across the globe. The impact this had on American countries and the value, or lack there of, of Black lives globally even today in 2021.Without Bartolomé de las Casas we would never have had the civil rights movement nor the Black Lives Matter movement.The catholic church is directly responsible for and complicit in crimes against humanity and this author just ignores them. Included in this glossing over of the history of the catholic church is the total absence of addressing the priest-rapists who the catholic church hid in areas where the parishioners were POC and the church turned a blind eye the kids the priests raped. The priests target vulnerable children period and the church simply moves them to parishes with even more vulnerable children. Its sick as fuck and a crime the church continues to perpetuate.In 2021 in Canada being uncovered are mass graves of Indigenous/First Nations children murdered and abused by nuns & priests of the catholic church.The author/historian does go on and on about the small ways in which the church was persecuted historically.However the historical facts say that since roughly the early 1400's catholics have done the persecuting on an international scale. This history of the catholic church needed to deal with the crimes of the church beyond apologizing for fucking antisemitism.Apologize for chattel slavery.Apologize for genocide.Apologize for rape and torture.Fuck this evil ass church and fuck this racist ass historian....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Jul 10, 2021","Jul 13, 2021","Jul 10, 2021",,Audible Audio,view (with text),/book/show/17549460-the-catholic-church

He makes the case that balancing the powers of Castile & Aragon against those of Portugal and perpetual war is the main reason that Rodrigo Borgia, as Pope Alexander VI, gave church sanction to the genocide and wholesale slaughter of the Indigenous Peoples of the America's.Imagine if the pope had instead demanded that the inhabitants of the new world be accepted as equal in stature to Castilian Christians. Also this author neglects to mention that Portugal & Castile begin what develops into the Transatlantic Slave Trade in about 1450 for Portugal and 1470 for Isabel. Alexander VI ignores these horrible crimes against humanity and in fact encourages them for love of gold.It's mentioned that the first European painting featuring an Indigenous Person of America was created during Pope Alexander VI's court in Rome. What isn't mentioned is that the individual in the painting was brought back to Europe as a slave, literally stolen by Columbus and his henchmen.

I pre-ordered this from Kindle as soon as I read it was available but have hesitated to read it during the pandemic.The newspaper story touched me so deeply I ugly cried. I have ancestors lost who were sold young and we do not know and can not find their people. So these stories hit me especially hard. Reading the book I discovered that many folks who encountered this lost history cried. When this was on display at Middleton Plantation Museum this exhibit includes a box of kleenex because few visitors left dry eyed. Now this exhibit is at the African American Museum in Washington DC and I would imagine the reaction is the same.Yet this book covers so much more than Rose, Ashley & Ruth.This covers the history of chattel slavery in what becomes the Carolina's first and later South Carolina. From first Indigenous Peoples of the America's who were enslaved until it resolves into solely West Africans enslaved. This covers foods, clothing, housing, slave markets/blocks/pens, to traditional chores/expectations of enslaved peoples, the crops they grew, etc.The picture is so rich that it helps fill on the spaces of the lives of these remarkable and resilient Black women.Beautifully and respectfully done.I'm gonna buy the audiobook as well because this is a book I'll return to.Tiya Miles out did herself with this.

I agree that Americans are complacent.My problem is white authors need to use white people like them as their villains. Islamophobia is a very real issue for Muslims folks, violent Islamophobia is a real problem in the USA impacting real folks. This storyline reinforces a negative and inaccurate stereotype by connecting angry Muslims to vengeance and terrorism. 9/11 happened decades ago. Today we understand that terrorism in the USA wears a very different face.White supremacist groups are responsible for most of the terrorist crimes committed in the USA.As the author appears to be white, she no doubt has many insights into this community. Not that I'm suggesting that the author is white supremacist or connected to them. No, but she is white and must have racist family. I know this because my mom is white and I have an aunt and a cousin who are white supremacists. I mean they aren't marching or anything but they are quite lost to their racism. My aunt even has a biracial son and is still proudly white supremacist, which she of course refers to as 'a real/true Christian'.

It never happened and is a white supremacist myth. Irish people were oppressed and genocide was enacted against them in the UK.

She determines with zero evidence that Elizabeth has borderline personality disorder and that her physical illnesses are all 'hysterical'. There's no evidence to suggest Elizabeth wasn't experiencing physical illness. Her symptoms in fact sound like Dysautonomia which is one of the conditions I struggle with.

Those situations were never equitable, even if those involved felt that they loved each other.

Still the wife would've been considered colored or a negro in that time period. Not so much today.The husband lives with her & her family off and on for 3 yrs before the marriage. One of her sisters married a white man and the other married a Black man and had a child with him.So this family doesn't seem to be passing so much as taking advantage of their access to British whiteness and special-negro status. The wife's father is biracial with a white mom and a father from the Colonies, presumably Black. It's unclear as race is handled very differently in the UK at this time.I enjoyed the exploration of the differences in how this case was covered in the white & Black Communities.The husband's father pushes for the divorce and the treatment of the wife is brutal, including her striping off her clothes to show how dark her skin is, it's humiliating on every level. Interestingly both of the lawyers, for the husband suing for annulment on the grounds his wife hid her race and the lawyer for the wife maintaining that her husband knew very well she had colored ancestry, make cringeworthy and horribly racist arguments in defense of their clients opposing interests. The low rating is a reflection of authors own bias & antiblackness.There's a comparison made that a white man who makes a living as a black-face entertainer is not quite white by virtue of him engaging in the racist practice of black-face!?! A silly and offensive take.Also the author weirdly ignores that Margaret Sanger far from 'ignoring' Black women, had a plan for them to be sterilized in an attempt at genocide of Black Americans. The fuck she did forget about us.

The thing is I'm aware that there's no direct evidence to this effect.It's possible that Louis Charles, Louis XVII, was the child of Fersen, though I find it extremely unlikely.Treating these fun conjectures as if they are facts is wrong, to do so without direct sources to support such statements renders this 'biography' largely fiction.That's really the issue for me.If I can catch the authors repeated inaccuracies given my limited expertise in this area that renders the rest of the work suspect as well.This isn't well sourced when these claims would need to be heavily cited. Honestly, I'm not sure the author really even read the books cited in the text as I find it hard to believe given how the author characterized Louis XVI that she actually read John Hardman's bio on him.I purposely read this slowly so I could check sources, none were really offered in the audiobook but even in the Kindle copy sources were light until the end of the book and even then simply a 'Selected Bibliography' which is not sufficient to cover the claims put forth in this biography. Still, I double checked as I could with the books I'd read on Louis XVI & Marie Antoinette as well as the French Revolution as a whole. This lacks adequate sourcing for the sheer amount of historical conjecturing.This is entertaining but heavily biased and really of no use as a history source.I have enjoyed this author's previous biographies and wish her no ill will. I was asked for a  in exchange for a free copy but I turned that down when I read the early s and purchased my own copies, so I could fairly  this and this is simply my honest .

She was exoticized, fetishisized and othered.It's all right there in a historically accurate reading of the painting which multiple Black Historians have provided.Feel free to watch A Stitch in Time season or series 1 episode 4 in which the presenter gets told to her face that she's wrong.It's on YouTube.The painting in the movie Belle is altered because the origin is racist.Why did she include a white lady who lied about being a WOC in a section about WOC?...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Mar 26, 2021","Mar 26, 2021","Mar 05, 2021",,Audiobook,view (with text),/book/show/56672935-mad-and-bad

I quite enjoyed the light tone.At the same time, much like in her previous book, The Lady Killers, this author just ignores the historical, gender biased, oppressive society that created these women.None of them were rich folks who chose to be awful. In fact a few were born into criminal families simply continuing the family business. Yet class was ignored entirely beyond wondering how someone barely literate could pull off a con like this.To evaluate the crimes, these women would have to be placed in their appropriate time and the restrictions of their race, gender & class accounted for or at least dealt with in realistic ways. Instead these societal oppressions are just ignored, in fact the author speaks derisively of sexual assault allegations revealed by the women after being caught. I mean one of the women spoke about being molested by a father, step father or mother's boyfriend starting in her teen years. The author dismisses this derisively as if a con artist lies all of the time or about everything.The Black Women from the 1800's & early 1900's pretending to be Spiritualists or Psychics would have been working in a career closed to them and that created themselves. What would they otherwise have done for work in those time periods? What would their earning ability be? The Commodore Vanderbilt founder of the dynasty regularly stole from women, including his own daughter, who gave him money to invest AFTER he was the wealthiest man in the US. He lied, printed fake bonds, we have federal laws and departments to keep up with the shenanigans of him and his Gilded Age pals. Yet none of them are known as anything other than power capitalists.These women were labeled criminal in the same era these men are labeled heros for much the same behaviors.This is due to class and race which besides being labeled is missing in the analysis of the crimes and criminals.None the less I enjoyed this and found a few women I'd never heard of before. Most of the crimes are light grifter type stuff a few have harrowing details but the author keeps a light tone throughout.

I do know oppression and how it is perpetuated often unintentionally in historical texts. I know how language is often used to place responsibility for oppression ceaselessly at the door of the oppressed.I am passingly familiar with some of the history regarding how Jewish folks were oppressed in Europe. I studied directly what happened on the Iberian Peninsula before the 'Moorish' conquest and after the Catholic Conquest in 1492. Post 1492 Castile (Spain) Jewish folks were forced to convert or leave under duress and without most of their possessions & wealth. However later, The Spanish Inquisition, which was largely Castilian as Spain as we know it did not exist at that time, primarily targeted converted Jewish & Muslim folks, Conversos & Moriscos. Because converting didn't lessen antisemitism.Yet this author's theory is that in France at least that antisemitism was reduced when Jewish folks converted to Catholicism, prior to Napoleon taking power in France, anyway. The French Revolution not only ended second class status for Jewish folks but apparently ended antisemitism in France wholesale. So that Napoleon and those supporting his viewpoints on the concerns of 'Jewish moneylending' & Jewish folks failure to assimilate into French culture were acting out of legitimate concerns?Even though concerns about 'Jewish moneylending' is a dog-whistle antisemitism. Much like concerns about Black folks and crime or drugs. The existence of The Spanish Inquisition would glaringly refute the position that assimilating ends antisemitism. So what is the author suggesting here?The eradication of centuries of antisemitic oppression In what 15 or so years???? I truly wish that oppression could be eradicated that easily or completely. Napoleon was wildly antisemitic. It wasn't that Jewish folks weren't 'assimilating' quickly enough. That's a very common tactic of oppressive regimes, the claim that groups which are oppressed and ostracized aren't making an effort to assimilate. No, it was that Napoleon was only okay with Jewish folks being members of French society if their Judaism was limited to their ancestry and not their religion, language, customs, dress, etc.Napoleon's coup of France flips The Revolution on it's head. He sets back the advance of Civil/Human Rights in France centuries. Women gain truly equalizing rights for that time period in Europe during the Revolution, Napoleon removes many of those rights. One example, the right for women to sue for divorce, a right they don't regain for almost 200 yrs. He removes or kneecaps many of the freedoms given by the Revolutionary governments.This behavior predictably impacts Black folks when Napoleon attempts to re-enslave Haiti and successfully re-enslaves other French Caribbean Islands. He utterly betrays all of the ideals of The French Revolution and is a tyrant by every measure of the word.His treatment of Jewish folks in France is disgustingly antisemitic and should be labeled so. It's also on-brand with his general deepening & widening of what we'd now call white supremacist, sexist and fascist agenda/policies. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Mar 04, 2021","Mar 06, 2021","Mar 04, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/48570314-the-betrayal-of-the-duchess

It's like she isn't aware that amount of European blood doesn't legally change the status of enslaved peoples.I loved this but at the same time I want a deeper discussion of who Mary actually was.It's likely the historical Mary did not consider herself 'Black', colorism of the time being what it was and given that her children pass as white. She likely viewed them as white? Possibly herself as almost white? This book doesn't deal with any of that in any substantial manner.It's easy to forget that some mixed race POC fled Haiti in horror after the revolution just like their white contemporaries.

Also in many ways this felt off in subtle ways, almost like a white guy wrote it.The community Buck grows up in doesn't feel quite right, almost a stereotype of itself. I know satires run on stereotypes but they also usually have something profound to say and this story might work if it was set in the 90's. However set in our modern time it leaves too many glaring plot holes.Buck would've known that Sales Training isn't reserved for the wealthy and well connected. On the contrary most sales jobs train their staff and rarely does so featuring those openly biased sales tactics. Especially in an age of hidden cameras and exposure of company racist practices. It seems like Buck would've been smart enough to protect himself with footage of his racist treatment whether he ever released it to the public. That he never even seems to think of doing so is odd to me. The Chump presidency featured lots of secret taping of bosses and co-workers which this book is supposed to be set during.Sumwun would largely run on uneducated sales reps. No one from a wealthy well connected family would be using connections to get into a business like this. That companies bread and butter would be uneducated or undereducated sales reps. The product the company was selling was scammy at best and well connected folks are looking for companies that build their resume not potential future embarrassments.This company is not the equivalent of Amazon, Google, etc.Sumwun is the equivalent of used car sales. No one who has wealth and connections is doing these kinds of sales.Now maybe the top echelon but Buck is being trained on basic cold call sales which is something educated folks avoid.Also Black folks struggle to get ahead not because they don't have the training and knowledge but because white supremacy creatively blocks and unfairly polices Black success. Think Obama being the first president in history pressured to release the long form of his birth certificate in order to prove he belongs in the country of his birth and still many white folks insist he was never born in the USA. At the same time Chump still hasn't released his taxes which is a common practice with US Presidential candidates but he was allowed to flagrantly ignore. Black folks are held to ridiculous standards and white folks are held to no standards.No one has ever suggested, even chump supporters, that he was more prepared than Obama to be president. He clearly had no idea what was expected of him and was too dense to pretend. He broke laws and conventions without any consequences at all. So its not that white people have more preparation its that preparation and even professional standards do not apply to white folks or only apply selectively.The ability to sell to anyone will not change your life as anyone who's worked a crappy sales job can tell you. The skill to persuade and bullshit can be applied to life in general outside of work but it isn't really a benefit, its more scamming your personal circle which isn't winning.Black folks blowing the interview out of the water doesn't statistically get us the jobs and this book ignores that reality in annoying ways. So Buck preparing his motivated team to be fantastic at sakes wouldn't result in them getting jobs.Again anyone who watched the last 2 elections knows that white people have a weird preference for the unqualified white guy over the more prepared POC. So his scheme being successful isn't at all realistic.Also why does Buck remain so pathetically grateful to Rhett? Rhett didn't change his life, he used him repeatedly and never gave a fuck about him, why is Buck never able to see past that? Rhett owes HIM and not the other way around.The ending is silly and a let down.This ignores that Black folks have been successful historically since 1619, white supremacy undermines and dismantles Black progress. Take for instance what happened to Black Farmers. Or look up which historically Black neighborhoods in your city or town were destroyed when the interstates were put up. Imminent Domain laws are historically uses to systematically destroy Black ownership and wealth. Much like Tulsa was bombed when Black folks are successful, white folks literally steal that wealth and take credit for that progress. Sigh.The mystery was poorly handled and it was obvious which part of his past he hadn't dealt with and not hard to guess why he would be taken down.Still why does the hero of the story pay a steep price and the villain no price at all?It worries me that if this is written by a Black man he sees himself via a white supremacist lens and its mostly kinda sad.I'd read another book by this author....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Apr 12, 2021","Apr 15, 2021","Jan 01, 2021",,Audiobook,view (with text),/book/show/56504449-black-buck

Wah, identity politics, how dare POC want history to include their experiences, that's integration not history!'I honestly was expecting the author to have more than racism with which to make a point but I hoped in vain.I planned to take this argument down point by point and fact by fact. Unfortunately it's mostly organized as a whine-fest to The 1619 Project. Look, history isn't truth, it's an interpretation of what facts remain. What a historian chooses to focus and include in their history is a reflection of their own bias. The 1619 Project is the story of Black Americans, our story won't match that of white Americans but we are still entitled to our own history that tells the story from our point of view.This book is unnecessary because US history already focuses on and tells the white supremacist view of history.White people don't have to be upset about the 1619 Project, your racist version of history not only still exists but is told and taught more. The 1619 Project is no threat to you and if read with your version of history, which it will be, offers a more well rounded and complete view of what actually happened. Now we need Native American viewpoints and we are getting to most accurate view of what actually happened during this time period.This is necessary because history as it currently exists for the most part is the formal study of white supremacy passed off as a scholarly subject.That's because the study of history as a discipline has it's roots in white supremacy as does anthropology & archeology. This is a well known fact and to have an accurate record of ACTUAL history the experience of EVERYONE involved will have to be included from THEIR point of view.This is jarring when all you've all ever known is a white supremacist view of history.Christopher Columbus was a liar, a thief, an enslaver and a colonizer.

The author shares her sources so completely that I've been able to track them easily and found the sources do indeed say exactly what us reported and more.This also tracks early ideas of race & racism to before the crusades. Noting that much is debated in Greek & Roman times about the differences in sexuality in women born in hot climates vs women in colder climates being more frigid. This is scarily relevant to how Black marginalized genders are viewed today in comparison with how white marginalized genders are viewed.This also finds that what are known today as white Christians would be the first group to tie the 'race' to social characteristics. White European Crusaders viewed themselves as 'racially' Christian. Also existed an idea that Christianity removed skin color or washed the person clean inside & out. So Muslims are described using racist stereotyping but not Morisco converts. So the act of converting to Christianity 'whitens' the physical body and soul. There are multiple Medieval plays using this tired theme. At the sametime a fascination or obsession with the Black body begins to be reflected in artwork of the period.This book basically tracks Black folks in Europe from Roman times to present.

Kate Hubbard gives a really good account of their marital breakdown in Devices & Desires and i highly recommend it to interested parties though in general I prefer Mary Lovell's Bess of Hardwick.I think Hubbard's book is less biased towards Bess but slow as it focuses on building and household furnishings.It's very thorough but the focus doesn't interest me. Still her research into the breakdown of the marriage is worth reading.While Bess may have been considered odd in her times and her interests seen as 'masculine', today we know those views to be sexist bullshit.

We have no way to judge if Mary married him out of trauma bonding or fear. The author stipulates that she is so abused by Bothwell that it impacts her beauty but refuses to acknowledge that trauma would be the result of abuse of that magnitude. There's certainly no reason to believe that a grown woman, who was twice widowed, a mother and a queen in 2 Nations would fall into bed with her low born, already married, protestant Lord after he kidnapped her. Bothwell had served her mother and it's doubtful she seriously considered someone of his station acceptable for marriage to a queen, even had he been unmarried.I'm aware that Queen Mary wrote letters to argue that the marriage was her free choice. However admitting that a monarch could or had been stolen, held against their will and sexually assaulted, especially if Bothwell held her prisoner her until she was pregnant, would make her already difficult position as a woman ruler near impossible.I think it's very likely she lied to save face.

The vast majority of white abolitionists mostly cared about the impact that owning human beings had on the souls of white folks. They recognized that unlimited power breeds unlimited corruption and they were legitimately afraid that generations unchecked of this behavior in white folks would lead to a lessening of their race. They were afraid that this would result in a character much like our current president: the least of the white race leading the nation to ruin.The author tends to not be completely honest about the struggles Black folks faced in this time period. He presents Chatham, Ontario as a Black Escaped Enslaved-folks Haven but basically presents it as segregated. To the extent that Black folks needed their own firehouse. He neglects to offer why this was necessary or speculate what this means for the actual power and social position of Black folks in Canada. This is crucial because the author is somewhat disparaging of how Black free and enslaved folks handled their oppression. If you wanna offer opinions you have to explore the entire situation, not just as it relates to white folks.The author continually struggles with seeing Black folks realistically in their time and place. He holds John Brown's white supremacist view that white men can't respect Black folks freedom if they don't 'earn it' by freeing themselves. This view ignores that Black folks had been rising to free themselves since before the first slave ship left West Africa. (If this is new info for you be sure to check out Fighting the Slave Trade by Sylviane A. Diouf)None of the US uprisings: Gabriel Prosser, Denmark Vesey, Nat Turner, etc , much less Haiti, was treated with 'respect' by white people. In fact all of these uprisings were heavily criticized and sabotaged, if not outright thwarted by white people. It was frustrating and disrespectful as fuck to have the author continually act like Black folks were too frightened to rise up against white men.The author also fails to write about the aftermath of the rebellions/uprisings on the Black Community. Black folks who did not live anywhere near the uprisings were murdered out of white fears. White people formed roving gangs and took out their angst and anger on Black folks in general all over the south. I find it hard to believe the author doesn't know this. Uprisings don't just impact the Black folks who participated. John Brown knew his actions would never put his wife or kids not involved at risk. That wasn't true for Black people. Our entire community would pay for our actions and so the cost is considerably higher. We still paid it and had uprisings but this is crucial as to why Brown doesn't get more support from Black folks. Yet the author only mentions once why Black folks joining John Brown was considerably more risky for them than white folks. He mentions repeatedly, more than 10 times, that Black folks can't be respected without fighting for themselves. He uses Black folks voices alive at the time who had swallowed white supremacy to give this theory energy. It's racist and white supremacist thinking. The author needed to shut this shit down immediately rather than tease it out for 75% of the book.The other issue I have is the author presenting John Brown as antiracist. The author knows this to be untrue because he sites John Brown's Sambo story in the text. He quickly tries to point out that the Black folks alive at the time weren't upset by this story but he is only able to name a few Black folks. He has no idea how the larger community felt or if the community at large knew Brown wrote that clearly racist story. Instead the author tries to use Black folks alive at the times non-reaction as a way to neutralize the racism of a story called Sambo written by a white man. There's no cleansing that story of racism. Not by any standard.That story stands as proof that despite his later actions John Brown was racist.A John Brown Reader by Louis Ruchames can be found here on archive.org, the Sambo story starts on page 60: https://archive.org/details/johnbrown...I posted screenshots of the story on Twitter if you just want to read the story:https://twitter.com/Laileanah/status/...The author primarily focuses on why Black folks didn't join or trust John Brown. He neglects to tie this to Brown's own agenda or racism. Brown very much believed that he and other white men were needed to plan and lead Black folks in a rebellion. The author ignores, much like Brown did, that Haiti was 100% planned and carried out successfully by Black folks. In fact Haiti is the 2nd nation to break away from a European overlord, the USA being the first. No whites needed at any stage of the rebellion.Why didn't John Brown focus on leading other white men in a strike against slavery? The whiteness of Brown is why Harper's Ferry is a big deal. Imagine if he'd focused on a whole army of white men who's responsibility it was to stamp out an evil created and perpetuated by those like them. The author doesn't want to own that chattel slavery is 100% white people's fault much like John Brown didn't want to. There aren't 'good people on both sides', white people are a fucking nightmare full stop. It's not ok to try to dissipate responsibility for this by pointing at the victims. Black folks didn't need to be better victims, this bullshit is firmly on white folks shoulders.It's clear that it more important to John Brown that white enslavers not be harmed AT ALL than it was that Black folks be free. Brown spends most of the raid explaining himself, his views and resulting actions to his white slave oppressing captives. Freeing Black Enslaved folks is secondary.Brown deliberately outted the involvement of Frederick Douglass, and other conspirators, which caused him to barely escape with his life and hide out in Europe for years. Brown gives zero fucks about Black life.Before Harper's Ferry in 1858/1859 Brown and his men assist Black families to escape from slavery. Jim Daniels is an enslaved man who approaches Brown's group to assist with a planned escape of several families from surrounding farms in Kansas. The author makes it clear that the plan was entirely Jim Daniel's and the other Black folks involved who had clearly been planning this for sometime before approaching Brown's group. Yet, the author gives Brown complete credit for 'saving' this family when clearly these Black folks saved themselves. They approached Brown. Furthermore this was a workable and sustainable model for freeing actual Black enslaved folks and giving them the tools to start a new life in Canada. If Brown had expsnded and stuck to this model he'd have done more good while still stressed the system enough to spark the civil war. This plan didn't hold enough glory for Brown though.Brown was a racist tool. He planned poorly and only becomes militantly active in antislavery activities AFTER he mismanages his businesses, looses everything including his land and steals from his friends & business associates. He always intended to both die and let his companions die at Harper's Ferry. He wanted to be martyred. He needed to be important and remembered as such.While he did believe slavery was wrong and he was far thinking for a white man of his time period, he was also a racist white supremacist and so is the author for this fuckery...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Sep 10, 2020","Sep 15, 2020","Sep 10, 2020",,MP3 CD,view (with text),/book/show/980453.Patriotic_Treason

Both texts are flawed but considerably less biased then this book.The author treats Black Americans in a racist and dismissive manner, blaming us for our own captivity in tone. For not fighting our fight in the struggle against slavery.This ignores that abolitionism as a concept isn't created by white folks in Western countries. Black West Africans organized and fought against chattel slavery starting in West Africa in the 1400's. They fought in both North and South America as well as on every island in between. They used a variety of methods from outright rebellion, to uprisings, to murder, to running away, suing in local court systems, developing the Underground Railroad. Black folks always fought and were beaten but not passive.Ending slavery in the US was the job of it's creators and those that profited from it. It was never our job or moral responsibility to stop evil white enslavers, that was always the job of white people.Much like the responsibility for today's proud boys and racist militias fall at the feet of today's white americans. Those are your people and the responsibility both for the evil they perpetuate and the duty to stop said evil falls on them. Ending chattel slavery was always a debt white folks owed. They sacrificed their kids to it and I'm sick that any Black folks died for that. Nah, die for your own sins.The author's theories about why Black folks don't join Brown are based in white supremacy and I found them deeply offensive and ahistoritcal. That ain't got shit to do with us.Also the author strangely rewrites white abolitionists such as Walt Whitman as believing in racial equality when in in fact Whitman referred to Black people as 'baboons & wild brutes'.Most white Abolitionists were white supremacists. They didn't believe Black folks were the same as or equal to them. They mostly didn't want Black folks enslaved because it caused white men to become so evil and endangered their eternal souls. They really didn't care about Black folks.In fact Brown himself was a white supremacist. As evidenced by a 'sambo' story he wrote. The story is printed in it's entirety in A John Brown Reader by Louis Ruchames which can be found at archive.org: https://archive.org/details/johnbrown...I believe that John Brown believed that Black folks had the potential to be equal to white folks but needed guidance.

I'm rereading in order of publication to track how the attitudes towards the couple, changed or didn't change, in anticipation of Harry's upcoming memoir 'Spare'. I think my original  still works for this Original 2020 Review:British tabloids: print, online and TV, have been complaining nonstop and demanding Meghan go home. Calling her 'duchess difficult', british for 'uppity'.So she leaves and now they are big mad and screaming abandonment.Make it make sense.The claims that she, a WOC, 'stole' a white man from a former slave trading and violently colonizing tribe....The jokes write themselves.I believe Harry, Meghan, Charles, the queen, and other royals, all indirectly probably contributed some info using their friends and staff which is how most royals have gotten out their side of the story for decades.Typically, 'the royal' who is the subject of the biography that they either directly or indirectly participated in, will put out a formal statement denying their participation in said biography.In the case of this book and this story, it just so happens this is the 3rd book, at least, out this year covering the exact same royals, the exact same material and ALL promising to be in sole possession of the 'unbiased truth'.I read Meghan & Harry: The Real Story by Lady Colin Campbell published end of June. I ed it June 26th.I read Royals at War by Dylan Howard also published end of June. I ed it on July 2nd.The above biographies were written in pretty much the same tone, with pretty much the same claims to 'insiders, palace staff and friends' of whatever 'royal' providing the quote. All 3 biographies address the popular tabloid stories we've all read, seen and heard and all 3 possess at least a degree of bias. I give this book the most weight of the 3 ONLY because the authors say they have maintained journalistic 'sourcing' standards. I presume they'll be called out by the over-caffeinated British press I've been reading so much about on anything they misrepresented.So time will uncover the accuracy of this narrative.I'm sure the truth is both a matter of perspective and a bit lost in the sauce at this point. I think everyone involved is going to try to spin themselves as the victims.I would say that the Cambridge's come off as the Duke & Duchess of Pettyville in this and probably had the least involvement. Or pulled out as the relationship soured between the Fab 4.I don't really think we'll ever know everything and I don't really care.None of it is any of my business.Nothing I've read has really changed the opinions that I formed surrounding why Harry & Meghan exited the UK.Most of my suspicions were formed by the gaps left by in the first 2 books.

None the less this was fun, fun, fun.Also the details on the other players at court are helpful.I do wish the author had focused a bit more on Navarre and Henry IV of France's parents. I understand that this period is complex, complicated and intense.Frankly the Spanish Monarchy needed to be fleshed out a bit as well.These kingdoms are heavily intertwined and its hard to understand just how ruinous this period was for France without taking into account it's general behavior prior to the death of Henry II, Catherine's husband and Margaret's father.Also there was a weird reference to someone looking like a 'negress' a term I'm not aware of being in familiar use at this time period. In the 1500's 'Black' and 'white' people didn't really exist.The first enslaved peoples of the Jamestown colony in 1619 are listed as 'Angolans' and not 'Black', 'negro' or otherwise.So I'm unsure of what term was translated from french, I presume, to lead the author to define it that way....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Aug 08, 2020","Aug 09, 2020","Aug 08, 2020",,Audible Audio,view (with text),/book/show/25935875-the-rival-queens

I hope at some point***Edited on 2/28/21 to add: I lowered this to 4 Stars because as time passed the authors classism really ruins this book for me. I hope at some point this author gains more than a passing familiarity with theory of intersectionality and how it applies her biased viewpoints on class.***Original :I would give this 4.5 stars I rounded up because I think the message the author is conveying is that important.I greatly enjoyed the author’s ability to tie in Nazi Germany and apartheid South Africa's caste systems in comparisons.It's chilling to acknowledge that our caste system was stricter than the Nazi's. Still is.The only real issue I have with this book is the author’s own classism.Based on the results of a study comparing hypertension diagnoses between working and middle class white & Black Americans it was determined that while working class whites have the expected higher hypertension than middle class whites. Since working class has more stress and lower class status than middle class.For Black folks the opposite was true.. Black working class folks were found to have lower instances of diagnosed hypertension than middle class Black folks.What this study obfuscates is the vast differences in both access to healthcare insurance and access to quality healthcare is not comparable for working class whites and Black folks. Which is of course common sense in a book about caste.Working class Black folks have some of, if not the worst, access to medical care in the US. If they have insurance at all It's substandard. Which means that working class Black folks are undiagnosed and underdiagnosed. That's it.We'd need studies that specifically controlled for medical care over a lifetime. As presumably middle class Black folks are more likely to be raised in middle class homes with increased access to preventive care. The death rates of working class Black folks who did not receive official diagnosis or medical treatment would have to be accounted for in this math.Also the as this doesn't seem to translate to shorter lifespans for Black middle class folks when compared to Black working class folks, this statistic seems less and less accurate.Another area the author lost me with was her theory that envy creates jealousy (crabs in a barrel) in working class Black folks which causes them to attempt to sabotage successful Black middle class folks.This is again not born out in popular culture. The Black community furiously protects those members who rise. We see ourselves in them whether we have access to their level of education, skill or achievement. Black Twitter is famous for protecting Black folks in media and with status.I would think under this theory Barack Obama would've received a lesser percentage of the Black vote by virtue of Black jealousy as more Black folks are working class than middle or upper class. That didn't happen in either of his elections, he carried the Black vote strongly.This falls along inter-community status lines with cis Black men rating highest status and most protection.In fact often Black folks with less social power, like women most especially darker skin women or LGBTQA+ folks, are more often blamed for the violence enacted against them by the community.The community protected Cosby, R. Kelly, Chris Brown and more recently, Tory Lanz sorry ass. Black achievers are held up and revered by working class Black folks.Offered whatever limited protection the community can provide.It's unfair and unevenly applied, as it enacts along gender, sexuality, class, ability, etc stress lines. Still this author will be offered greater protection by the Black community than I would be. Precisely because of her status as a successful and famous Black woman.What she calls jealousy I call internalized white supremacy combined with fear of reprisals from the dominant caste.Black folks during chattel slavery did not betray planned rebellions & uprising because of caste jealousy. They did so because they had internalized racism & white supremacy to the extent that they somewhat believed the propaganda about why Black folks were held in captivity. A form of extreme so called Stockholm syndrome so to speak.The other factor is fear of reprisal by white people. History is full of white people who overreact in horribly violent ways. That violence maintains caste place by use of violence and fear.Fear of white reprisal is common sense, not jealousy.Also the author seems to honestly think that Black middle class folks are somehow the only ones who have to work twice as hard to get half as much.That's actually a fact for Black folks in the Western world full stop. In fact working class Black folks work twice as hard, or more, for much less than half of the money.I think this author is on some respectability nonsense with these thoughts and suffers from class bigotry.I think this is a result of perhaps class bias and bigotry her parents held.We don't often talk as a community about how much what wealthier Black folks bitch about is that their buying into propaganda hasn't erased their Blackness.They're not recognized as special and not like those other negros.Sigh.I truly wish she'd managed to contain her classism because this book would be perfect without that bullshit....more",Notes are private!,0,44,1,"Aug 06, 2020","Aug 26, 2020","Aug 06, 2020",,Audio CD,view (with text),/book/show/54419313-caste

That thinking is a byproduct of white supremacy.It's okay and natural even to hate vehemently those that are oppressing you.Furthermore the idea that you hate them vehemently is common sense and should be encouraged not discouraged.To this author I give the words of Tochi Onyebuchi from War Girls:'“We have tried peaceful protest,” Ngozi continues. “We have tried marching. We have tried registering even those Igbo in the hinterlands to vote in the elections.” She speaks not like she’s reciting from an article or from some downloaded history but from life experience. She speaks like someone whose parents argued politics over thetable at family dinners, like someone who was carried in her father’s arms during those peaceful marches. She speaks like someone who knew a period before war. Before it all turned to violence. “You do not meet hate with love. Some will say that when a hateful person makes you hate, they win. But those people will never say what exactly it is that that hateful person wins. They will say that if you resist hate and meet it with love, that you win. But they never tell us what we win. We see with our eyes. We see that the only thing we win is death by machete. Isolation. Massacre.” Her frown deepens. “They did this”'Being peaceful, kind and loving in the fear that if we don't forgive our enemies we become like them is bullshit.The most ridiculous nonsensical thinking ever. I become a rapist by hating mine? My hatred of him is equal to the crime he committed against me? We are now equal because I will not ever under any circumstances forgive him?The idea that forgiveness is universally healing is really a normalization of white supremacists bullshit, notice that burden is never placed on the criminal, just the victim.Love can be oppressive much like hate can be freeing....more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,"Oct 14, 2020","Oct 15, 2020","May 19, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/49247242-ring-shout

The book includes a section on the children of Chales V but facts about them are sprinkled throughout the book and not in an orderly or logical manner. The author primarily focuses on war and battles.Now this is important to this period but the author never even clearly delineates all of Charles holdings, the government bodies and policies. Again you are expected to know this already.There's not enough info on the actual players in Charles life. This really matters because of the size and type of his Empire.This is a disservice and kinda makes this a useless collection of battle dates.The author has a very limited view, cites lots of research but tailors his findings along biased lines.Example in the the first couple chapters about Charles V's parents. He totally removes all of the well documented abuse that Philip I inflicted on Juana I. Even for her sexist times he was considered wildly abusive. He locked her in room, he took away her clothes so she couldn't socialize with the court, he played horrible mind games with her. Instead the author portrays Philip as the model father and Juana as mean and unbalanced. Considering when this was written it's beyond irresponsible history. The author purposely culled the sources in order to create the image he wanted to portray, which is how biographies work. In this case very unhelpfully.Charles V is an asshole with no redeeming qualities. He stole from and betrayed all of his siblings as well as his own mother. He fucked over his wife and his kids-legitimate and otherwise.He was unspeakably cruel to his mother whom he kept in a dark room for decades lying to her, isolating her and allowing her jailers to abuse and torture her. He rarely visited but when he did it was steal her treasures.Cortez and Conquistadors happen on Charles V's watch and the author thinks he cared unusually for Indigenous peoples of the Americas....more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,"May 08, 2020","Jun 09, 2020","May 08, 2020",,Audio CD,view (with text),/book/show/50526180-emperor

Europeans at this time do not know to swim much less dive.With the discovery of North & South America this will grow into the Trans Atlantic Slave Trade.

In my opinion this is the most thorough biography written in English I've read on this queen.The author has tons of sources but I followed up on a few in relation to Gran Canaries and slavery. I found that the source he referenced didn't really match the paragraph he'd written in the book. So I'm unsure where some of his knowledge came from. Most importantly his treatment of the Indigenous Peoples of the Americas is racist.He only uses sources written by conquering thieves who we well know lied to make their theft more acceptable in Castile.For example the constant references to 'cannibalism' when we know Columbus labeled the Indigenous people he was capturing and forcing into slavery in Europe could only be sold in Europe if they were labeled as cannibals. The author admits this but only after repeatedly referencing cannibalism.In addition he completely uses European sources for Columbus's contact with the Arawak/Taino peoples. The Taino left records of their own about this exchange and the author doesn't include any of them. Worse yet he passes on white supremacist nonsense like they thought Columbus and the crew were gods.They fucking did not.

Over time European Catholic peasants begin slowly to farm in the empty wasteland between settled Catholic Europe and settled Islamic Al-Andalus. After awhile the church shows up to collect tithing and establish a local church. The nobility follows the church in a bid to steal the most from the poor hard working peasants.From this nobility arise the Kingdoms of Leon, Asturias, Castile, Aragon, Valencia etc. The nobility in these areas claims their right to rule to their fictitious descent from the last Visigoth Dynasty.In truth these are new Catholics barely if at all related to the previous Catholic Visigothic kingdom.So the 'reconquest' of Spain is really the conquest of Al-Andalus.Especially considering that the Muslim Umayyad Kingdom held the land for 700+ years, centuries longer than the original Visigoths.I guess if you're White all land belongs to you and if you're brown you're not entitled to land....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Mar 02, 2020","Apr 05, 2020","Mar 02, 2020",,Audio CD,view (with text),/book/show/972287.The_Other_1492

I borrowed this as an audiobook from Scribd so perhaps I misunderstood some of the particulars here. Yet, these European nations are all profiting from many forms of slavery between the captivity of West Africans to the captivity of various ethnic groups across what is now 'India'. How fucking hypocritical and ridiculous to act like slavery was only wrong when white europeans were harmed. I'm not surprised those at this conference felt that way but I'm disgusted that the author of a nonfiction historical text like this wouldn't explore this issue. In some way other than calling the concern over white europeans just a general 'call to free slaves'. They meant specific enslaved peoples here and I expect a modern author to handle this with considerably more accuracy.

The chapter titles are pop reference style which is fun, dynamic and relatable.This was not overly long or extra wordy and I liked the way the biography was laid out. I feel starting with her grandmother was an important part of understanding Harriet. I really enjoyed this and think it would be perfect for high school and up. Probably even middle grades as the visual aids and such might be engaging.The author makes a true effort to use modern language and concepts to make the story relatable for readers who don't often read this genre.I read this author's book on Ona Judge and it was written in a more formal educational and less conversational style. I enjoyed both takes myself.I am surprised at the negative s which seem to indicate others did not like this style of biography.I'm extremely familiar with this time period and this authors 'assumptions' are based in historically known facts about this period, place and class if not this specific individual. Of course we don't know exactly what Modesty felt upon being stolen from her home and traumatically transported to what is now Maryland. We do, however, have biographies written by Enslaved West Africans who survived being stolen and the Middle Passage. This is important to the story of who Harriet Tubman was and the author is correct to include it. It's always clear what's surmised from period specific research. Because the records for this particular individual are scanty much of the setting is simply surmised using factual period specific knowledge. Many noted historians do this, David Starkey and Robert K Massie come immediately to mind. They are both professors like this author, I think. Well, at least one of them is. The records for the time periods Starkey & Massie covered that I read aren't scanty, this is just their style. Almost conversational and slightly gossipy in tone, Starkey has included complete conversation scripts 'surmised' from court records, diaries, letters, etc. I think it bothers readers because there's this 'notion' in academia that Black people in general, the descendants of Enslaved West Africans in particular, are too dramatic about chattel slavery. Many books on this subject, in fact most in print, are written by white historians from their often unintended slavery apologist point of view. If that's all you've ever been exposed to this must feel jarring and uncomfortable. That's due to ignorance on the readers part in some cases.It's also 100% valid not to enjoy this style biography as long as you keep that same energy for regular whitewashed history. If you are unfamiliar with some of the information about chattel slavery in the US these are a few of the books I've read which is how I know the basic research the author is using to give depth and a bit of humanity to the Enslaved characters is validly based on historical facts.Most of these I've completely read a few I've so far just read sections not cover to cover.I offer this as my own basis of knowledge as the author has provided an extensive detailed bibliography as well as an extensive suggested reading section.Stamped from the beginning by Kendi X Ibram American Slave Coast by Ned & Constance Sublette An Imperfect God: George Washington, His Slaves, and the Creation of America & Master of the Mountain: Thomas Jefferson and His Slaves by Henry Wiencek The Hemingses of Monticello by Annette Gordon ReedForging Freedom by Amrita Chakrabarti MyersThe Black Tudors by Miranda Kaufman- gives an idea of early chattel slavery of West Africans in Europe both before and after Columbus.The Slave Narratives-haven't read them all yet but I've read multiple anthologies of them.They Were Her Property: White Women as Slave Owners in the American South by Stephanie E.

That did not really or significantly happen in the US during the War of Independence. That happens in the US during the Civil War.The irony is The War of Independence is really a civil war and The Civil War is the revolutionary war.At the end of the War of Independence power dynamics in the colonies weren't restructured for everybody only the elite.Contrary to patriotic/nationalist propaganda only land owning white men could vote originally. The law at that time further limited the men considered 'white' to exclude certain European groups and white Jewish folks. So basically the rich folks in the US no longer paid taxes to Great Britain and no longer needed to follow British rules about expansion.Everyone in the US who wasn't a land owning recognized as white man had their station in life either stay the same as in the case of white women and children; or get drastically worse as in the case of Black Free & Enslaved folks and the Indigenous Peoples of the Americas.The War of Independence changes chattel slavery in the US in significant ways that ultimately lead to 'slave' breeding. Which is a horror and really escalates the separation of infants & toddlers from their parents and families. The horror is unimaginable.In addition the War of Independence leads greatly disrupts Indigenous peoples of the Americas controll? rule? power? over their own lands. The Peoples and Nations that survived genocide are in vastly different areas than those that have cultural significance to them in most cases. Their sacred lands and even the remains of their dead are disrespected. In the western world we are just accustomed to the propaganda that prioritizes the experience of white supremacists over the view of history from the victims of white supremacist violence.***There are some interesting ideas put forth by the founding oppressors but applying these concepts to only rich white men so chattel slavery and genocide could continue uninterrupted isn't a revolution worthy of the word.***Now The Civil War lead to Reconstruction which is in essence a 'Second Founding' or a true attempt at founding a 'free' country. It starts as a legitimate attempt that horrifically fails for the most part.The Founding Oppressors are human rights violators and hypocrites. They didn't come up with the best government ever. Bear in mind that 1 in 4 of the Colonial soldiers were Black. Enslaved Blacks were promised freedom in exchange for joining both sides of this conflict.Some were given their freedom but very few.The British were better about attempting to keep this promise but barely.George Washington re-enslaved the soldiers who helped him win the 'revolution'.So no that's not a revolution.In France the 'revolution' doesn't start out with full freedom as the goal yet in the end women had rights they wouldn't have again until after WWII. In the 1790's.They first capitulated after a rebellion by Vincent Oge to allow Free Black people limited rights and eventually, after Haiti rebelled, they outlawed chattel slavery. They never enforced the outlaw of chattel slavery and even though other French 'slave"" islands have small rebellions none resulted in island wide freedom.The French weren't perfect or even close but they attempted to live up to their ideals.In the US we still don't have democracy in 2020 for all citizens. Specifically the colonized 'territories"": Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands and American Samoa all do not allow US citizens living there the right to vote. To recap in 2020 we STILL aren't living up to the promises of the Founding Oppressors.The US has never practiced democracy and the founding oppressors never intended us to.The author who I think is a professor of history really, really, really loves Napoleon.She seems to have a royalist view of the Ancien Regime as well.She continually praises Napoleon. She presents his military coup d'etat as 'rising to power'. She acts like his narcissistic wars across Europe & North Africa were logical, strategic and not a complete violation of the sovereignty of the countries he was invading.I really was ticked off when she refused to process Haiti through a realistic lens. No grace for Toussaint unlike for Napoleon.I mean Toussaint was a jerk in many ways but he WAS a military genius. With significantly less resources he beat Napoleon's virtually unbeatable army.The French Army ultimately have to lie and cheat to create a cease fire which enables them to cheat.At which time France illegally steals Toussaint and his entire family. In violation of their own treaty.Also Haiti isn't just the 'first colony in South America' to break with Europe: It's the most successful chattel slave revolt to occur during the history of the Atlantic Slave Trade. This put Haiti in a totally different position than France was in.First of all they were Black ex-enslaved or descendants of ex-enslaved West Africans, surrounded by hostile, racist and rabidly enslaving nations. I think Toussaint believed that Haiti's best chance to ensure that the island stayed free long term was to be useful to the hostile-white-supremacist-European Slave-nations which surrounded it. These Nations have a racist history of banding together with other white supremacist nations, even their traditional enemies, in order to more effectively steal from Black and Brown peoples and nations.So Toussaint paid formerly enslaved people for their labor, most assuredly not fairly and forced them to continue working in the fields. It is the limited freedom that Blacks will largely face across the diaspora for primarily white supremacist reasons. This isn't a perfect a compromise or plan but isn't worse than Napoleon's betrayals of the French Revolution which the historian/author presents as 'establishing order' or a 'return to order'. Ignoring that the revolution had pretty much settled down and the honeymoon period of military dictatorships is always brief.Napoleon wasn't any different in that department. He quickly set about creating endless war and conquest in an attempt to hold onto political power.A move those of us in the modern world should be achingly familiar with.We don't know what Haiti might have developed into had European slave-nations not stolen and killed their leaders and staged multiple undercover coups. Not to mention saddling them with debt and restricting their trade.Haiti is a mess because even today the old chattel slave trading nations can't handle a Black country founded by West Africans that white supremacist can not in anyway take credit for.Also because France charged ruinous fees to Haiti for having the audacity to no longer be enslaved.Fees it took more than a hundred years to pay.For land that was never theirs and they were never entitled to.Yet Napoleon was a complete turd and horrible human rights violator. He caused massive destruction across Europe and was on a narcissistic quest to 'rule the world' but she has nothing but praise.She seems unable to grasp that while it's a tragedy that 40,000 people died during 'the terror' but Napoleon is estimated to have lost almost a million soldiers from the Empire alone. Not including the losses in the countries he invaded,either civilian or military. His losses were staggering and he ALWAYS needed more soldiers. Way more folks than 40,000 died under Napoleon so I fail to see how his coup d'etat was stabilizing. Not to mention The Terror was basically over when the Jacobins were guillotined. France was relatively stable when Napoleon made his coup d'etat. He didn't save folks from the terror, he WAS the terror.It's just no one cares about the people he killed while the folks killed in 'the terror' were aristocratic and royal.Royal and aristocratic deaths aren't more tragic than those whose lives the royals and aristocracy were putting at risk through, at best narcissistic theft and neglect. Governments don't exist in a vacuum and when they screw folks over it's natural and normal for citizens to harm them back.Also the authors attempt to pass off Napoleon's antisemitism as 'assimilation' worries is cringeworthy. He set up Gentile councils to 'monitor' Jewish communities rate of 'assimilation' into the French Empire. The author treats this like a valid concern failing to acknowledge that Jewish Communities weren't 'failing to assimilate', French society was rabidly antisemitic and refused to allow them to participate fully. The folks who needed to be 'policed' to make sure that 'Jewish' folks 'assimilation' into the French Empire is smooth are the ones doing the policing. Yet this is just glossed over and ignored.I understand that some of Napoleon's methods of bureaucracy used are still used today.Some of the scientific advances gained via Nazi war crimes are still used today. Whatever advance in medicine or science doesn't in any way cleanse the Nazi inventor/finder/etc of their guilt or crimes against humanity.The same is true for Napoleon.We can only learn from history when we tell the truth about what was fucked up.Also the author pretends like the 'insurgents' in various countries occupied by Napoleon's military dictatorship are partially responsible for the violence resulting from them fighting to be free. Um, no there's not 'atrocities on both sides' when Napoleon illegally occupies another sovereign nations.Is this historian serous?Napoleon isn't entitled to force other nations to join the French Empire because he has a dream of ruling the world.Napoleon and The French Empire are responsible for whatever violence occurs.So the conclusions drawn by the author/historian/professor are shit takes and uphold sexism, racism, antisemitism, etc. It's really too bad because this is engagingly handled and streamlined in an easy to process way. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Jan 16, 2020","Jan 19, 2020","Jan 16, 2020",,Audible Audio,view (with text),/book/show/18274973-living-the-french-revolution-and-the-age-of-napoleon

The author is a 'royalist' and I don't at all agree that these monarchs were even murdered.Most court proceedings are biased and unfair. Usually that type of justice is limited to the unwanted populations of society.I don't really care that those that normally benefit from a systems oppression are instead themselves oppressed and killed.Oh well Marie Antoinette was quite involved in the politics of the revolution and that's interesting.Also the role of Madame Polignac as a tool of Louis XVI and friend and confidante of Marie Antoinette. This is interesting because often Polignac worked against Marie Antoinette FOR Louis XVI.Much of this was enlightening and interesting. Much more complex and complicated than any biography I've read about her. This is basically focusing on politics and a reader is expected to already be familiar with Marie Antoinette's life.I'd say this is a good balance for Antonia Fraser's famous biography of her.At the same the tone of the biographies are vastly different....more,Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Dec 24, 2019","Jan 24, 2020","Dec 24, 2019",,Audio CD,view (with text),/book/show/52895350-marie-antoinette

The author is bizarre and uses a lot of sexism to define Diana and racism in how the Prince of Wales interacts with POC. Its cringeworthy. Charles has a lot of racist liberal tendencies.

It's cringeworthy and probably shouldn't be in print. His fascination with traditional medicine is made much of in the book but again is par for the course in this cringeworthy narrative. Modern medicine has incorporated many aspects of so called traditional medicine, those that are found scientifically to work. The authors discussion of traditional medicine as practiced amongst people of color is just chock full dog whistle and colonial racism. This is published much too recently to not simply be a reflection of the authors own racism and internalized sexism.Also the author hates Diana.
