I found her both inspiring and mystifying. Her mental illness was desperately misunderstood and mismanaged and you can't help but feel the spectacular, horrifying frustration of watching it take over her final weeks.

Explores all aspects of vegan nutrition with common sense, practical advice, countering the stranglehold social media idealists have over the vegan image. The authors readily admit that there are a number of diets for optimal health and there is no reason to pretend that veganism is the perfect diet for every body. Instead, veganism is a philosophy and ethics about how a person wants to live among their fellow creatures and should be considered on those merits. Because it involves our food, however, veganism DOES require a basic working knowledge of nutrition to be optimally healthy. This is true for all kinds of diets.

It is set in Iceland in the early 1900s, among poor sheep farmers who have been thoroughly indoctrinated into the mythology of Independence.

( And yes, if you are American, this rings plenty of cultural bells.) It is Laxness’s quiet precision at revealing these sorrows and inequities without sentimentalizing them that make the book so profound and memorable. There’s plenty more to say about the spot-on skewering of wealthy “liberalism”, capitalism and the voracious destruction of “growth”, as well as the darkly comedic genius of the writing, but I’ll just leave it where it’s at and say, read it....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"May 19, 2022","Jun 20, 2022","May 19, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/77287.Independent_People

The question becomes who will survive, who do you want to survive and how will they manage it? ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Feb 03, 2022","Feb 06, 2022","Feb 03, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3409731-the-feast

I learned a lot about the subtle kinds of racism that exist toward Asian Americans and presumptions and biases I own that had never been brought to my attention before. Hong has a lot of anger - understandably so - and she spares no one, least of all herself. From a reader's perspective, it may have made the book easier to digest if she had allowed some space to take a breather from that anger, but it's her book and her story and I wonder if it was cathartic to lay it all out like that. It wanders a bit toward the second half, when Hong talks in depth about her personal friendships and her experiences as an artist, but again, I picked up threads of understanding that I hadn't considered before.

""A myth was an event which, in some sense had happened once, but which also happened all the time. ...Because of our strictly chronological view of history, we have no word for such an occurrence, but mythology is an art form that points beyond the history to what is timeless in human existence, helping us to get beyond the chaotic flux of random events, and glimpse the core of reality....Mythology is not an early attempt at history, and does not claim that its tales are objective fact. Like a novel, an opera or a ballet, myth is make-believe; it is a game that transfigures our fragmented, tragic world, and helps us to glimpse new possibilities...""...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Dec 12, 2021","Dec 20, 2021","Dec 12, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/27311.A_Short_History_of_Myth

El Akkad takes the reader through the range of complex responses to the realities of immigration in a way that is sometimes heart-breaking and sometimes eye-opening, but always painfully truthful. In an interview, he has said the key to this story lies in the epigraph. I recommend reading the whole thing and then going back and figuring out what he meant.

I also ended up with a glimpse into Saunders as a teacher and person. What a gift. I already liked him from his work in Lincoln in the Bardo, but this book reveals the wise and gentle heart behind the writing. ""Every human position has a problem with it. Believed in too much, it slides into error. It's not that no position is correct; it's that no position is correct for long. We're perpetually slipping out of absolute virtue and failing to notice, blinded by our desire to settle in - to finally stop fretting about things and relax forever and just be correct; to find an agenda and stick with it. What I admire most about Chekhov is how free of agenda he seems on the page - interested in everything but not wedded to any fixed system of belief, willing to go wherever the data[the truths of his characters] takes him....This feeling of fondness for the world takes the form in his stories of a constant state of reexamination. (Am I sure? Is it really so? Is my preexisting opinion causing me to omit anything?) He has a gift for reconsideration. Reconsideration is hard; it takes courage.""...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,Nov 2021,"Nov 11, 2021","Nov 01, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55290026-a-swim-in-a-pond-in-the-rain

The rest of the story was disappointing, despite its readability, which is why I'm struggling with how to rate this. The journey of the child, Astrid, through foster care is predictably dire. Either California's foster care system in the 90's was *very* different from other states' systems or Fitch knows nothing about it. For sure there are bad foster parents, but as a former foster parent myself, I know there are basic housing requirements and oversights that would have prevented nearly all the situations Astrid encounters. (Fitch partially solves these problems by making her social workers inept idiots who never visit the houses where she lives.) There is a truly disturbing, overly-explicit sexual relationship with a man in his 50's and another later on, all dealt with as if Astrid is just unusually sophisticated and sexually competent. So many of the truly disturbing things that happen to Astrid are dismissed out of hand as she moves on to her next tragedy. Any one of the horrifying things that Astrid deals with would be enough for a novel. This just feels like overkill.

Imagine that all the women in the world were suddenly given an irrevocable, unbeatable personal weapon. What might they do with it? What kind of revenge might they seek for centuries of male oppression? How would men react? Alderman imagines it all unsparingly - and sometimes quite cleverly.

Stegner's eye for details of the time period and his obvious appreciation for the vast landscapes of his settings make the book worth reading, but he also has a genius for understanding and explaining the uniquely American mindsets that arose out of that time and place. (One example is the protagonist's mocking reaction to the 1918 flu pandemic and its accompanying restrictions of social distancing, masks, and quarantines. It felt shockingly real and immediate though the book was written in the 1940's.) The characters are so real and well-considered it's hard to bear with them sometimes (the book is somewhat autobiographical), but ultimately worth it. It's also fascinating to read about the West before it was over-developed and exploited and Stegner has a tremendous eye for detail that makes his scenes sing. I know so much more about every day life at the turn of the last century just by reading this. There's a reason he's one of our literary treasures.""To have that rush of sentimental loyalty at the sound of a name, to love and know a single place...Those were the things that not only his family, but thousands of Americans had missed.

The book was written in 2017, before the election mess and the pandemic, but it is shockingly prescient. (In looking at negative s here it seems that many of them were written in 2017 - I can't help wondering if the ideas in this book seem so far-fetched to them now.) El Akkad's global journalistic experience lends him a sharp eye and ear for the way ideologies get entrenched in people groups and how war serves to radicalize its victims rather than solve conflicts. This, to me, is the genius of the book. The plot and characters are adequately drawn, but it's this ability to show that despite its mythologies about unity and democracy, the US is made up of ideological groups that will inevitably clash as the world around them changes, that really lingers after reading.

Her premise here, that Southern Confederate ideologies went West after the Civil War and reinvented themselves into the Cowboy Mythology of the white man on his own against the corruption of (evil) government forces, is pretty intriguing. ""Mythology tells us that the theme of the American West was freedom, but the opposite was true. Like the antebellum South, society in the West was hierarchical according to race, class, and gender."" (That's true of my home state of Oregon, for sure, which was founded as a state for whites only in 1859.) I was pretty fascinated about the shape this narrative took in the media (Bonanza, anyone? Little House on the Prairie?) and how completely baseless the assumption was that men were forging a trail out West by their own grit and determination. The West, HCR points out, was based on extractive economies from the beginning: gold, mining, oil, for example, and these were all mainly controlled by big businesses that relied on cheap (read: immigrant) labor that was unregulated and unprotected. Cowboys, with their dangerous, exhausting work for little pay, were more like eastern factory workers than loner heroes. It's a great read and a quick dive, but it's helpful for understanding the way that individualism and deregulation were both essential to the Confederate South and have become entrenched in modern politics today....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jul 22, 2021","Jul 26, 2021","Jul 22, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52048467-how-the-south-won-the-civil-war

A gut-wrenching dive into the realities of the Israeli/Palestinian situation and the courage it takes to cross barriers, to see the other. McCann shows great sensitivity in retelling these stories, each person is given time and space to be honest,angry and complicated as well as inspiring. The name ""Apeirogon"" refers to a shape with a countably infinite number of sides, and you can feel McCann trying to turn and turn and show yet one more aspect to the story. Everything matters - the migrating birds, the traffic patterns, the clothes the bombers wore, the age of the soldier, the feeling of the hospital corridor, the mapping of the Dead Sea by a would-be priest. McCann offers us one facet after another in tiny snippets until it all builds to a densely complex picture of grief and courage as well as a passionate pursuit of peace.

They thrived in the grandeur of their rage. Yet underneath their masks they were riddled with self-doubt. He could sense the fear behind the clenched jaw. He almost knew the coming lines by heart. Once a terrorist always a terrorist. We didn't ask for them to blow up our children. They deny our very existence. They want to wipe us off the face of the map. We gave them freedom, they gave us rockets. They want to push us into the sea. Security.

I had to look hard to find Liz Berry's books for sale here in the States but I am so glad I did. She writes of her own place and experience of the Black Country in (I believe) the West Midlands area of England. The dialect in many of the poems is ferocious (there are helpful translations) and strange to my ears, but the working class world and the longings of a young woman growing up within it are easily recognizable and relatable. (Whenever she writes of love or children, there is so much longing and tenderness it almost takes your breath away.) Tucked in to the harshness of coal mines, bodies ruined by work, and the vice of social shame, there's a bend toward the mythical and the natural world, which I love.

First there is the beautiful tribute to Jewish culture and mythology (as well as Eastern Europe mythology), the (thinly disguised) religious and cultural conflict that shows a great deal of knowledge about history, a plot that keeps you turning pages, a great landscape, and characters you really want to like. It all makes for a great story which I didn't want to put down. Frustratingly, the book is also buried in an avalanche of metaphors. It's not that the metaphors are bad or poorly written, it's that there are so many of them. A little restraint would have made this book shine. The most frustrating part though is the petulance of the main character, Evike. She's mind-numbingly obtuse, stubborn, and self-destructive. I think the author wants us to believe there are reasons for this, but it is painful to read on the page. There is also a great deal of repetition. 3/4 of the book is Evike repeating to herself the same phrases, remembering the same romantic scene, and lusting after the Woodsman (he's the wounded, noble sort so I don't blame her necessarily). There are also some plot questions that I would have liked to have answered, but they are minor. My last complaint is more subjective, but there's an unnecessary amount of violence/gore. Frankly, it's just boring to read and I don't think it adds anything to the quality of the story. All in all, the novel is a fun read and I would gladly recommend it, but I think that the lost potential for it to be a great read is what makes me feel so frustrated....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jul 16, 2021","Apr 27, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/48915408-the-wolf-and-the-woodsman

I was really overwhelmed by the way Baldwin captured the intense pressure and spirituality of the Pentecostal world - one which is familiar to me from my own childhood, albeit without the added layer of a racially charged culture. Watching John struggle to swim to the surface of it all left me exhausted and impressed with Baldwin's ability to put it on the page. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,2,not setnot set,"Feb 12, 2020not set","Feb 12, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17143.Go_Tell_It_on_the_Mountain

There's a lot of intelligent writing here, and I loved the concept of the road trip to record the ""echoes"" of the lost, the search for Apacheria and the exploration of child immigration. Luiselli is a knowledgeable and talented writer. But this book falls into a category I am definitely bored with: highly educated people on their way to divorce. It was hard to like the main female narrator - mainly because she's just so...flat - and although I loved the children's characters, something about them seemed wrong as well. They were sometimes too young and sometimes too old. The first half of the book is pretty slow, but it picks up when the children take over. That is the strongest and most poignant part of the book, imo, and the son's acceptance of the demise of his family is heartbreaking.

I've seen how substance abBecause my family has been involved for many years with foster care and adoption, addiction is something I'm familiar with. I've seen how substance abuse wrecks innocent brains and is passed down through family lines, how poverty and violence and shame rot everything. So I approached Seth Haines' book about addiction and what underlies it with some trepidation. When I was done, I had mixed feelings. First, I know Seth and know his sincerity and honesty and that comes through in this book. He is unflinchingly transparent about his own pain and the coping mechanisms that led to addiction in his life. That experience gives him a clear-eyed view of the tendency we all have to turn away from Divine Love and towards things that can trap us. (Money, sex, and social media get equal treatment alongside substance and porn abuse.) He believes that the way out of these disordered affections is through communion with God, and he experiences this in a very literal sense when the wine of the Eucharist becomes the agent of healing for his addiction to wine/alcohol. (Even though Haines' theology seems closer to Catholicism in this book, the writing style is still very evangelical in its folksy reliance on the bible for any spiritual input. That may be hard for readers who are not part of the target audience.) His best insights, in my opinion, come at the end of the book, when he talks about true sobriety. He describes a 135-pound heroin addict who gets clean, but ends up gaining over 100 pounds because he's transferred his addiction to junk food. ""Sober? Really?"" Haines asks. ""Without an approach to dependency that treats the whole person, including the underlying narratives of pain, we'll never walk in waking sobriety."" This I can agree with wholeheartedly.Haines goes to great lengths to show that most of us deal with addictions of one kind or another that keeping us from connecting with Divine Love. On this level, I think the book works well and will be best for the type of people who have the money, time, and inclination to pick up a book on addiction and apply it to themselves. (Haines himself admits at one point that if you're reading the book, you are probably affluent-ish.) I do not think that Seth set out to write a manual for treating serious substance addiction or its generational effects and so I don't want to critique him too harshly on that point, but I did feel it was important to draw a distinction about who this book would be appropriate for. Personally, I would not simply hand it over to people I love who are mired in cycles of serious substance abuse and poverty. As a relatively healthy person, I can understand what he means when he says of his healing Eucharist experience, ""The wine of my poison - it has become the substance of salvation,"" but as a mother, sister and friend of people who fight addiction daily, I had to put the book down for awhile. (He does leave a caveat for alcoholics saying they need to know their own weaknesses and do what is best for them. But I think that implies a level of health and awareness that many people I am involved with wouldn't have.)  According to the summary on the back of the book, ""As Seth writes - addiction is simply misplaced adoration."" I can certainly see areas in my own life where this is true and I appreciate Seth's encouragement to keep stripping away the things that obscure my connection to God, and I think this book is most appropriate for people who are in a similar place (or at least have done a good deal of work on rehabilitation, have wise support around them, and are ready and able to go deeper spiritually.)...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,"Jan 10, 2020","Jan 10, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/44441850-the-book-of-waking-up

It was powerful, shocking (not to discover that racism is pervasive, but to realize how much of it I've passively accepted in my life), humbling, and infuriating. Remember after the 2016 election when we were all reeling with shock and all our black friends were saying, ""welcome to reality""? I understand that better now. Kendi shows in excruciating detail how racist thought has dominated American culture from the beginning and has never been expunged. But more than that, he reveals how racist beliefs FOLLOW racist policies as a way to justify them. In other words, we did not enslave Black people because we believed they were inferior. We enslaved Black people because it was economically beneficial to us - and to distance ourselves from it morally, we created a narrative that Blacks were an inferior race that needed our Christianizing and ""stewardship."" You can see this still at work today in social policies. It is a long book, over 500 pages, and densely written. At times, I thought Kendi wielded his labels a little too broadly, but as I said, I considered the book from the standpoint of hearing a version of my history from a necessary and informed perspective rather than a precise history (though, as I said, I'm simply not qualified to judge it on those merits.)

The old tragedy of man's insatiable consumption, and the new reality we face because of it. It's powerful, disturbing, and hopeful all at the same time. The main story centers on a diverse group of people who each have powerful encounters and relationships with trees and are called in their own unique (imperfect) ways to act. There are academics and lawyers, game designers, eco-activists and terrorists, misfits and clowns, but they all take part in the slow unfolding of the future - as we all do. Powers covers the spectrum of possible responses to our future, but reminds us in the end that the earth itself has a long, long lifespan.

The writing is gorgeous and nuanced and excruciatingly intimate. The characters, for the most part, are deep and complex and the relationships between them equally complex. The central themes, about trauma and recovery, about loving someone who cannot believe themselves worthy of love, are beautifully and thoroughly explored. I doubt I will ever forget the commitment and kindness so many people show to each other in this story. Nor will I forget the terrible pain and self-loathing that other characters live with as a result of experienced trauma. The false note - and it's a significant one - is in the back story, which is so horrific and unrelenting that it begins to feel cliche. (I did read an interview in which Yanagihara says there are fairy tale elements to the book and she expects readers to enter into the fantasy to some extent. That's helpful.) I chose to suspend belief in order to watch the unfolding of the relationships and hope that there would be healing for these characters.
