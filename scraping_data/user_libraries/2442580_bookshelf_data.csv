The edition I read was combined with another novella, The Train (about which more separately). The titular Premier is, at 82, long retired from the French government, living a rather curmudgeonly life on the coast of Normandy, and provided for by a staff (driver/valet, secretary, cook, nurse, security men and even physicians) apparently still on the government payroll. It is a constricted life, by age and physical ability, but also by the sense that his staff keep their bosses informed of his doings, for whatever political benefits or liabilities might accrue to the coalition in power. And indeed the Premier is still very interested by the goings-on in Paris.In fact, he has retained some documents which could prove embarrassing to various people, most significantly his one-time protegé who is now on the cusp of being asked to form a government as the nation ""is in crisis"". The President of the Republic has called our no-longer younger minister to make the request, and is promised an answer the following morning. It was on the news, the aged Premier heard; the question is: will the younger man come and visit the Premier asking for advice (or forgiveness)? A terrible storm rages in Normandy, which has cut off power and telephone; To stay in touch, the driver has rigged up the car radio with speakers inside the kitchen (this written in 1957). Will he come?Morning dawns, and there has been no visit. Power is restored to the house, but the Premier soon learns that his own power over the affairs of the nation are truly a thing of the past. With this realization comes a certain peace. With the help of his secretary, he spends the morning disposing of the supposedly incriminating documents he has kept, learning that the government has known about them all along....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Mar 05, 2013","Mar 09, 2013","Mar 12, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9669104-il-presidente

Leaving his home near the Belgian border with his four-year-old daughter and seven-months-pregnant wife, they take the first train south into an unknowable future. The women and children are put into the first class carriages while the men are accommodated in the goods vans at the rear of the train. In the confusion during those first hours, when troop trains are headed to the front and refugees from Belgium are headed south, the man and his family are separated.But he is not alone. A young woman—no more than twenty-five, without baggage or any posessions it would seem—appears to have attached herself to him. She is slightly odd: she has an accent that is hard to place, neither Belgian nor German. Her lack of even a handbag is just a bit suspicious. And although he loves his wife and child, when she offers herself sexually, he does not refuse.Eventually they arrive in La Rochelle, among the few non-Belgians in a refugee camp on the outskirts of the town, allowed to stay more because no one knows what else to do with them than for any good reason. It turns out that she in Czech and was released from a women's prison when the Nazis invaded. They settle into a sort of routine, tenuous though it is, he helping out around the camp as a jacques-of-all-work, she tagging along (afraid to talk much least people mistake her accent for the enemy). Every few days he goes to the Hôtel de Ville to see if he can find where his wife is located from the postings of refugee names.The government capitulates and the occupying Germans arrive in La Rochelle, but not much changes until the day he sees his wife's name listed and he leaves the camp. Although both he and the girl know that their time together has ended, she joins him for the journy across the country to the place where his second child was born. He knocks on the door of the maternity home and the Czech girl walks away.He encounters her twice more: one night after the family has resettled back home, while making a delivery, she slinks out of the shadows and asks if he can provide assistance in hiding someone. She is understanding and non-judgemental when he demures, given his young family. Shortly after, he reads her name and that of a British flyer on a list of those executed for espionage.There was a tenderness and repressed passion which was very touching. I selected this book primarily because I didn't know where to begin with Simenon, whose work was recommended by John Banvile, speaking of his inspiration if writting the Benjamin Black ""Quirke"" books.

Based on a true story, the eponymous ""Arthur"" is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, best know as the creator of the consulting detective, Sherlock Holmes. Already by the early 1900s, Doyle's character had gained such notariety that people wrote to Sir Arthur with their own cases in the hope that he might intervene, as if he were his own character. He rarely did. But overcoming a funk which had descended after his wife's death of consumption, Doyle found the case of George Edalji invigoratingly compelling. A mild-mannered solicitor in Birmingham, George had been tried, convicted and sentenced to seven years (of which he served three) for maiming farm animals on the flimsiest of circumstantial evidence and a healthy dose of racism: Edalji was half ""Parsee"", that small sect of Zoroastrians from India, known during the Raj as being the greatest of Anglophiles. His father had converted to Anglicanism, moved to England and took Holy Orders at Canterbury, afterwhich he was given the pulpit in Great Wyrley, Staffordshire, some twenty-miles northwest of Birmingham.The great theme of the novel, like so frequently in Barnes work, is the nature of ""Englishness"". Both George and Arthur consider themselves eminently English, though also ""outsiders""; George more obviously by virtue of his heritage and skin-tone, Arthur less so, being a Scot with a distinct Irish lineage. It would be easy (and quite enjoyable) to read this merely as a detective story in its own right. But Barnes makes it much more, and we're all the richer for it....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jan 29, 2013","Feb 02, 2013","Jan 29, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/386178.Arthur_George

It is rather his reminiscences and impressions of a city he visited both before and after the fall of the Communist regime in 1989 (as well as more recently).

Only thrown once that I could detect.I didn't see the film, but somehow know the general gist, but even so, I'm just going to wallow in the marshmallow.Indeed, one of the film s (by Janet Maslin, writing in The New York Times) gives an indication of the feelings about the book:""[The] director...has transformed The Bridges of Madison County into something bearable—no, something even better. Limited by the vapidity of this material while he trims its excesses with the requisite machete, Mr. Eastwood locates a moving, elegiac love story at the heart of Mr. Waller's self-congratulatory overkill. The movie has leanness and surprising decency, and Meryl Streep has her best role in years. Looking sturdy and voluptuous in her plain housedress (the year is 1965), Ms. Streep rises straight out of ""Christina's World"" to embody all the loneliness and fierce yearning Andrew Wyeth captured on canvas. And yet, despite the Iowa setting and the emphasis on down-home Americana, Mr. Eastwood's Bridges of Madison County has a European flavor. Its pace is unhurried, which is not the same as slow. It respects long silences and pays attention to small details. It sustains an austere tone and staves off weepiness until the last reel. It voices musings that would definitely sound better in French.""Emphasis mine.I really fail to see how this book gained the traction it did. The dialogue is laughable, the ""framing story"" ridiculous: as if two adult children upon learning that their lately deceased mother had a four-day fling a quarter-century earlier would say: ""This is a story the world needs to know! Let's find a professor of business management to tell it!""

Never mind that both Cass and Vander are dead (for ten- and eight-years, respectively) when the story opens; since when has death been a disqualifier for fictional characters?There are in fact two plots here: Alex (not to be confused with Axel, not just yet) reminisces about his first sexual experiences, a magical summer fifty-years earlier when he carries on an affair with the mother of his best friend. Intermingled is the present where—after a hiatus of ten years (just before the death of Cass)—his acting career is revivified by the offer to appear in a film, a biopic of none other than Axel Vander. That summer he was fifteen and Mrs Gray was thirty-five: a hardly impossible age disparity, despite its improbability. Alex is a terribly unreliable narrator, however; he misremembers so much, and readily admits it. Whilst waxing poetic about the falling russet leaves or hoar-frost on the lawn, he'll come up short with a ""wait, wait—but this was summer"". For all his pleasant prose, so carefully crafted, Alex really is a bit of a dolt: an autodidact (bordering on dilettante), self-absorbed, endlessly absorbing the sights, sounds and smells around him, he is rarely aware of their significance. His great redeeming quality is that he knows this is his weakness.And the prose does belong to Alex, as narrator (rather than Banville, as author): he describes his writing space (a hidey-hole at the top of the house with a high window and a green-leather upholstered visitor's chair); we know all along that this narrative is coming from the character. It's a conceit Banville has used before (in both Eclipse and Shroud for example), letting him use both the present and past tenses, permitting for both recollection and recording.Banville's real subject of course is not teen-aged lust or life imitating art. It is memory: the tricks it plays on us, the ways we use it to defend and define us, to cajole, or comfort, or even berate ourselves when that is paradoxically comforting. Many of Alex's memories are wrong: with the assistance of a researcher (a charmingly obscure character in black denim and leather and a beat up 2CV named Billie), he tracks down someone from his past who sets him right.I wished there were more of that Billie in the book; there was more than enough of the other Billy. Indeed, the dramatis personae is crammed full of Doppelgängers: Billy and Billie, Alex and Axel, Dawn and Cass, JB and John Banville.[There's so much material here, I can't cover it all.]There were a few disappointments for me. In Eclipse, Alex had retreated after his stage career collapsed to his mother's house in Wexford, long abandoned to a caretaker whose first priority was apparently taking care of himself: he and his teen-aged daughter had moved into the house themselves, as a sort of ""perk"" of the job. I wished we had gone back there to see how they were getting on; I liked Quirke and Lily. More importantly, the theme of the original novel was also memory: Alex riffed for dozens and dozens of pages on his life growing up in the close confines of the little town. I expected that Ancient Light would have given at least a passing explanation on why Alex left out any intimation of his romantic affair with a married woman twice his age from the earlier writings.The saving grace is that there was the set-up for another installment: Alex was invited to attend a conference in Arcady (the thinly veiled Berkeley) where Axel Vander taught. He decides to attend, in the company of the screenwriter and Vander biographer JB.

This is the story of a love triangle, of sorts. Oh it’s all so very modern, or post-modern, or at least contemporary. Gillian and Oliver are married. Oliver’s one time best friend is Stuart. Gillian and Stuart were once married. Oliver “stole” Gillian from him (one might say). Oliver is a pompous prig, an over-educated wastrel, with various projects ""in development"" (which is another way of saying he thinks about things to do, but never does them). Stuart was a bit of a milquetoast but seems to come into his own when he leaves England after the divorce, goes to the States and becomes a successful businessman in organic veggie marketing. Go figure, it was the nineties. Of course, then he comes back: back to England, back into Gillian’s and Oliver’s lives.But none of that is important, that’s only plot and character. No, the brilliant and highly entertaining part of this book is the way it’s told: in separate, long, individualised “block quotes”. As if the characters were speaking to an un- identified interviewer, the person behind the camera. Think of Woody Allen and Diane Keaton in Annie Hall, in the therapists’ sessions, speaking directly at the camera, the questions unheard, only inferred from the replies. And you, the readers, are the camera. Of course you didn’t hear the questions you’re hearing over your shoulder (busy adjusting the lens or f-stop or something), so every utterance—no matter how seemingly banal—is brilliant, and fraught with potential weight.And others get their say as well: Gillian’s mother, for example, has a fair bit to contribute, and Stuart’s second ex-wife. And Gillian’s young assistant (who’s shagging Stuart); even Gill’s and Ollie’s daughter, Sophie (poor kid).The artistry of course is that one hears each individual voice in the writing—every few paragraphs the text shifts suddenly into that individual character’s voice. Some are easier than others, the children, Gill’s mother (she’s French and doesn’t speak the English so well, yes?), but the three principles are all of the same class and educational background. It’s very well done and extremely entertaining.Love, etc., would make a fantastic mock-umentary. I kept seeing, or hearing rather, Hugh Laurie as Stuart, but he’s a little long in the tooth at this point; the principal liars are all in their mid-40s: Still not too late for a youthful indiscretion.(Unfortunately I found after having finished that this is a sequal to his 1991 novel Talking it Over, which has the same format.

(It does seem odd that the action never seems to cross the Liffey in this particular book.)I won't dwell on the plot, it's unimportant: two men die, other people cause it, still others (our nominal ""heros"") figure out who they are and why they did it.

I'm posting the same  for both books, as it is a ""compare and contrast"" sort of thing:I’m ing these books together because they are two interpretations with the same basic plot at their cores: an older man goes to a brothel to sleep with a virgin. But oddly enough, despite the common setting, “sleep” in both books is not a euphemism for sex: the girls in Kawabata’s novella are drugged, their clients are forbidden to violate them, though most would be physically unable to do; Márquez’s unnamed narrator finds a fourteen-year-old virgin asleep from exhaustion and doesn’t have the heart (or level of desire) to wake her.Naturally this gives both men plenty of time to muse on the nature of sex and aging, memory and its vagaries, although with very different aesthetics. House of the Sleeping Beauties has the rigidity and cool complexity of a Zen rock garden; Melancholy Whores is lush and thick as a dripping tropical forest of its unnamed location on the Caribbean coast of South America. Beauties has the harsh sensuality of denial and deprivation—it seems to be always winter—and somewhat in keeping with one’s perception of post-War Japan, before the economic explosion of the ‘60s; Whores exhibits the sensuality of ennui and entropy, the colonial splendour gone seedy, gradually losing the battle against encroaching nature: A metaphor perhaps for its narrator.I enjoyed the Márquez book much more—perhaps because of the innate cultural bias. I first read it when it was new. When I heard about the plot of House of the Sleeping Beauties, I immediately recognised it and was intrigued. And indeed, Memories of My Melancholy Whores begins with a quote from Kawabata’s work which I didn’t appreciate on my first reading.

Those have not been translated into English (at least not yet) and so there’s no way to compare those to what came after. Eight years before his break-out novel, Baltasar and Blimunda, this book anticipates Saramago’s signature style: There are run-on sentences, and characters’ direct quotes are not separated into individual paragraphs, but there are quotation marks. It is in some ways the most “grounded” of his works, in that it takes place in a specific time and setting. The background is the final years of Portugal’s fascist dictatorship under Antonio Salazar and his immediate successors, all of which fell apart in the military coup of 1974.The narrator is H., a professional portrait painter for the haute bourgeois of Lisbon. He hates his job: he hates the people for whom he works, he hates the works he produces. He knows there must be more. More than his mediocre work, more than his loveless relationship with a nice woman, more than his superficial friendships with other superficial, petit bourgeois friends. Frustrated with his inability to break out of his own bourgeois existence, he takes up writing—the “calligraphy” of the title—in an effort to make some sense of his experiences. We get long digressions on Italian Renaissance art (not long enough really, as they are beautiful on their own), but which act as one path for H. to search for meaning in his life. H. also explores reading Marx, and though we get the feeling there is certainly some sympathy for the concepts, it seems a dead end.But one friend, a quite architect about whom H. actually knows very little, proves to be much more: when he is arrested by the regime for political activity, H. seeks him out to see if there is some way he might help. The following day his friend’s sister, M., comes to visit, and his life—and Portugal’s—is soon turned inside out.It was so much fun to see in this early work so many topics that Saramago would take on in future novels: the Church, the State, the Corporations, the Nation, the Bureaucracy, even Death. The prose was a little dense, even more so than in a typical Saramago novel, and it took a while to read, but it was well worth it and very satisfying....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jul 06, 2012","Jul 24, 2012","Jul 06, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/12385372-manual-of-painting-and-calligraphy

By the standards of our advertising- and internet-fueled world of almost constant pornography, they are extremely tame; however by the standards of the 1940s—when they were written for an ""annonymous collector"" at a dollar a page—they were most surely quite racy.One has to apply the a similar sensibility to use of language regarding racial identity: it was somewhat startling to read in the story ""Saffron"" about the ""colored"" household staff in New Orleans. But the meanings of words change over time; it's one of the intrigueing things about the English language that today saying ""people of color"" is quite respectable whereas ""colored people"" is somehow perjorative. I doubt Nin—with her wide-ranging experience in France during the inter-war years—was much effected by racial prejudice.All in all, I found the stories sweet, and a good reminder that those things we do for our satisfaction are not new—they've most likely been around for aeons.

Miss Hearne is a spinster in the forties; orphaned as a young girl she was raised by a distant aunt—also a spinster—whose sense of propriety and religious intolerance hobble any sense of independence and fun in Judy’s character. After nursing the older woman, she finds herself alone, descending into a genteel shabbiness of rooming houses on the Catholic fringe of mid-century Belfast. Her two sources of comfort are the Church and, alas, the bottle.

But she was raised to be a pretty and pleasant accompaniment to the finer things and the better people, with the goal of eventually marrying into the wealth she felt entitled. Unfortunately through a series of unfortunate events and mis-played hands, Miss Bart does not achieve her ultimate goal.Perhaps more than any other, the theme of ""entitlement"" is one that resonates most clearly to our turn-of-the-twenty-first century ears. Today the word is an epithet, not infrequently leveled at those who occupy the lower rungs of society. Ms. Wharton's use of the word as a critique of Lily Bart's strivings among the ""one-percent"" was somewhat less loaded with rancour, but no less withering for it.I would have liked to give this book the highest rating, as it was indeed amazing; my only reason for withholding that honour is less the author's fault than my own: as charming and engaging as Wharton's prose is, it remains somewhat stilted and alien to my 21st-Century ear.

As with all good fiction, the plots and characters are an armature upon which authors can comment on whatever they damned well please.And now some observations.

'It's the County Home.' [page 122] Now the first one makes reference to William Trevor, whose father was a bank manager who moved the family around every few years. Trevor went to a boarding school, but in Dublin and CofI. The school in Wexford must be St. Peter's College (the Christian Brothers being the kiddy-fiddlers in question) from whose hallowed halls both John Banville and Colm Tóibín graduated.The second quote isn't specifically about an author, but does seem the reuse the location in which Sebastian Barry set his novel The Secret Scripture.

I know my ex-wife had one of his early books in her extensive collection of Canadian fiction, and perhaps that coloured my opinion as well.

An eleven-year-old semi-autobiographical Michael is sent—alone—from his home in Colombo, Ceylon (present-day Sri Lanka), to England; it is 1954, and the only way one travelled those sorts of distances then was by ship. Once on board, he befriends two other boys of roughly the same age, also heading alone to a more hopeful future in the ""mother country"". In the dining room all three are seated as far from the Captain's table as possible, and the ""cat's table"", out-post of the misfits, the penurious and ne'er-do-wells of the Oronsay.But surprisingly (and pleasantly) The Cat's Table turned out to be far more than just a ripping yarn of pre-adolescents run amok in the last days of commercial ocean liners. To say anymore about the plot would require a ""spoiler alert"". The writing was lovely: there was a calm and reflective air to the whole enterprise.

Sure, his father was a gonif who went to prison and abandoned his family and his poor mother (rest her soul) died in childbirth—that happened in those days, but Bucky is a good boy, a man, on his way. He loved and respected the grandparents that raised him, he was honest and diligent, worked hard, got strong, had good enough grades, even went to college for two years. And if it weren't for his terrible eyesight, he wouldn't be the new gym teacher at Chancellor Street School, he'd be with his buddies Jake and Dave in France, fighting Nazis.But instead, Bucky finds himself with a different nemesis, one which he is profoundly incapable of dealing. In the summer of 1944 however, no one was capable of dealing with polio, particularly the epidemic sweeping across the urban landscape of northern New Jersey, and centering—inexplicably—in the quiet and industrious (and predominantly Jewish) Weequahic section of Newark. As director of the playground, running a summer sports program, Bucky leads the boys of the neighborhood—his boys—in softball round-robins and track and field events. Until they start getting sick, catching polio and dieing.How could this be? Everything is going so right for him: he's got a great job, doing something he loves; he's got aspirations (to one-day coach at Weequahic High School); he's got a beautiful and delightful fiancée in Marcia Steinberg, the daughter of a doctor no less (even if she is off working at a summer camp in the Poconos). How could God do this, kill His children? What kind of a God would create polio? Maybe it's God that's Bucky's nemesis.As the epidemic intensifies, and the summer temperature in ""equatorial"" Newark will not abate*, Bucky's resolve weakens. He just feels so helpless, yet he has to help, if just by being there. So when Marcia phones him from the mountains to say that a job has opened up at the camp (due to the water director being called up in the draft), he takes it. He abandons his neighborhood, his city, his playground. He abandons ""his"" boys and walks away from the responsibility he accepted. It's the worst thing he's ever done; the only time in his life he walked out, and as much as he loves Marcia and loves the camp in the mountains and all the great kids there, he begins to hate himself. The nemeses are mounting...Another tale from the Weequahic section of Newark, New Jersey, Philip Roth's ""home town"". As with Everyman and The Plot Against America, there is a familiarity of time and place that I find both appealing and endearing: Reading these novels is similar to listening to the stories my father told of growing up in the Heights neighbourhood of Jersey City in the 1930s and '40s, a mere five-miles or so to the east.Roth's recent output, since Everyman in 2006, are now categorized as his ""Nemeses"" novels: they explore ""dark questions"" (according the jacket blurb) such as ""How does the individual withstand the onslaught of circumstance?"" It's a good question; the answer that Bucky Cantor provides, by the end of this short novel, is not one to emulate. In the two ""Nemeses"" novels I've read (this and Everyman), I've found a sense of Roth in deep reflection; perhaps this is an end-of-career project. But what a career.

It is Berlin's equivalent to Hyde Park in London or Central Park here The main park in the centre of Berlin is the Tiergarten, laid out in the 1830s. It is Berlin's equivalent to Hyde Park in London or Central Park here in New York, and takes its name—literally ""the garden of beasts""—from its historical roots as a royal game preserve for those Prussian princes, the Electors of Brandenburg. But it is the bestiality of 1930s Berlin, however, that centred around Tiergarten, which is the subject of this fascinating slice of history by Erik Larsen.William Dodd, chairman of the history department at the University of Chicago, was a plain-spoken, simple scholar selected by Franklin Roosevelt in 1933 to represent American interests in Germany. Roosevelt had taken office on March 4th of that year, barely a month after Adolph Hitler became chancellor on January 30th. Dodd's simple lifestyle and humble roots (his father was a North Carolina sharecropper) were at stark contrast with highly developed protocols of what was still very much ""Imperial Europe"" despite the fall of so many royal dynasties in the aftermath of the Great War. Indeed, Dodd was at odds with the professional ""diplomatic class"" in the U.S. State Department—Ivy League men mostly, of independent means—who considered him something of an embarrassment. But then Roosevelt always was a traitor to his class, god-bless him.Dodd was appalled at the ruthless consolidation of power in the first year or so of Hitler's Reich. He, along with some of the professional foreign service corps (but not all), tried desperately to warn the State Department and President of the danger Hitler posed. I'm certain that much of what they reported was not believed simply because it was so unbelievable.Besides the obvious political and diplomatic emphasis of this story is also the personal side of embassy life. Indeed, Dodd brought along his wife and two grown children: Bill Jnr. and Martha. In the Garden of the Beasts is as much Martha's story as her father's, for Martha considered herself a ""bright young thing"", and as the Ambassador's daughter she was the toast of the town, dating (and bedding) rising stars in the diplomatic community—French and Soviet—as well as a share of the host government's best and brightest, including the first chief of the Gestapo, Rudolf Diels.But her initial enchantment with the dynamism of Nazism quickly waned and as she watched her father's inability to raise the alarm in the West, she quietly worked in a modest way to undermine the regime by providing information to the NKVD, precursor to the KGB. Indeed, as a result of her involvement with the Soviets, she left the United States during the witch-hunts of the 1950s and settled in Czechoslovakia, where she died in 1990 at the age of 82.This is an eminently readable book. Larson's prose just flies. (It helps that the end-notes are not called out in the text, however there is a citation for every word within quotation marks, and many that are not.)

Tomáš is a philandering doctor who considers love and sex two distinct entities, unrelated; Tereza, his wife, is the one true love of his life. Although her husband’s infidelities hurt her deeply, she begrudgingly accepts them as a part of his character that she is powerless to change. Sabina, a painter and one of Tomáš’ mistresses and confidants, leaves Prague and becomes successful in the West; one of her lovers, Franz, a Swiss literature professor, abandons his wife and daughter for Sabine, who immediately overthrows him. Karenin, the dog of Tomáš and Tereza, presents a stability that eludes the human characters.This is a philosophical novel. Kundera shows how the actions of humans are directed by response to endless strings of coincidences and are ultimately meaningless. This is the “lightness” of the title. The German phrase Einmal ist keinmal (once is never) is used to express the idea that if a thing happens only once, it may as well never happened at all; there is no way to learn from it, there is no way to repeat it, there is no way to change it. Though a similar situation may arise in which it may be possible to extend some meaning, it will never be the same event—the new situation will itself be the result of another long string of happenstance. The new situation will itself be a onetime thing, never to be repeated.But there is an emotional effect (at the very least) on the people involved in these events, and the events change them, change their “being”. It is the realisation that events are irrevocable and unchanging which is unbearable. Indeed, the events which haunt our personal lives are so insignificant to the balance of humankind—have such little weight, are so light—that they defy being borne.Heady stuff, cleverly and entertainingly handled....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Sep 14, 2011","Sep 20, 2011","Sep 14, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9720.The_Unbearable_Lightness_of_Being

Such a concept is so outrageous, it must have been true, and one can see how the author, stumbling across such a fact, might be inspired to research it further.More than just a fictional accounting of an historical institution however, House of Meetings allows Amis to examine how the Soviet Union was a failed state, and how its successor, Russia, is fast on the way to follow.

It is the relationship to these forces that Margaret Atwood attempts to define in her second novel, Surfacing, from 1973. These two threats imperil and provide the impetus for the development of the Canadian psyche, Canadian culture.Atwood’s father was a government entomologist, and like the unnamed narrator, she spent her childhood summers in the forests of Québec that provide the setting for the novel. The plot is relatively simple: a woman learns that her widowed father, who has retired to the family cabin on an island in a remote northern lake, has gone missing. Driven to the nearest community by a married couple and with her current boyfriend, she investigates his disappearance, sure that she’ll be able to find clues others would not see. While there, she realises how very little the others are prepared for the wilderness, how little they understand of it and its power. Not only her own companions, but also the other visitors they encounter (mostly Americans and what might be described as “Americanised” Canadians).The narrator assesses the camp, in good detective-novel tradition: judging from the weeds in the garden she guesses how long her father has been away, from the supplies he left behind how long he anticipated being away. And in the interim, this setup provides Atwood with ample opportunity to explore the philosophy of the wilderness, the north, its use and abuse, its animals and resources and “our” relationship to them all.At the end of a week filled with emotions (both genuine and misplaced), word arrives that her father’s body has been found, apparently the victim of an accidental fall. The woman’s reaction is curious; she believes the others (everyone else in the world) are lying and conspiring to wrest the island from her possession. I imagine that this allows us to explain away what happens at the end to an emotional breakdown: The party finally falls apart (things had been disintegrating as the week progressed) and the narrator expels them from the island, hiding in the bush and refusing to leave.Unfortunately, I found the last section least satisfying. The sexual tension that had been building throughout the week finally manifested itself only after news of her father’s death. Personally, I thought that announcement would have had a more damping effect on the libidos involved: all that followed seemed to me somewhat unconvincing. That said, I liked Surfacing very much. It’s interesting to remember how many of these same ideas would be explored again in later works, like Cat’s Eye and The Handmaid’s Tale. I don’t need to repeat what a wonderful writer Atwood is: her list of awards and honours is testament to that. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Aug 31, 2011","Sep 03, 2011","Aug 31, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/46755.Surfacing

Even well past the great age of maritime discovery, there was no credible way for a mariner to know his longitude; latitude was easily computed through celestial observa- tion, but longitude meant time: as the earth spins through its twenty-four hour day, position relative to some fixed point could be determined if only one knew the time at the fixed point. Thus the search for an accurate time piece, one that could be taken aboard ship and remain accurate through changes in weather, temperature, humidity and of course the rolling and heaving across the great oceans. Such was the problem that dozens of ships and thousands of lives were lost, foundering on even the most familiar coasts due to their unexpected location. In 1714, Parliament passed the Longitude Act, which established a prize of £20,000 (equal of over £2-million today) and the Longitude Board to administer and certify the efforts.How Harrison, working later with his son, struggled to have their work accepted and fought against sceptics and critics is the “drama” of the book.

Reading Saramago is like having a chat with an endearing, avuncular “character”—because one gets the impression that just behind every turn of phrase or meandering anecdote, there’s a sly smile or wink waiting.

Play with friends and relationship with a younger brother. Roddy Doyle was the me I might have been. And now, all these years later, he still is. Bullfighting is a collection of short stories about men of a certain age, the middle of middle-age you might call it. Men who are dealing with new realities in a new Ireland: post-Tiger, depressed and sometimes depressing. Their children are grown and out of the house; their jobs have grown boring or evaporated altogether; their marriages too. Friends begin to die; they themselves are under doctors’ care.And oddly enough, for the most part, that’s all right. They’re getting by:Getting older wasn’t too bad. The baldness suited Martin. Everyone said it. He’d had to change his trouser size from 34 to 36.

But that was the point—he was fooling himself. He’d put on weight but felt a bit thinner.Doyle’s greatest gift as a writer may be his ability to transcribe the Northside Dublin voice: the phrases and accent and timing. It’s never gratuitous, certainly not at all mocking or demeaning. He captures a specific place and time. I read a few of these stories earlier, in the New Yorker.

The jacket blurbs put it in the “Lad Lit” tradition of Nick Hornsby, Roddy Doyle and Michael Chabon, and while the three main characters are young, outwardly attractive and flawed, the similarity stops there. I was also reminded of H.E. Bates' 1952 autobiographical novel Love for Lydia, which I read over thirty-years ago. (I may have to reread that.)David (the narrator) is dull and shy, a nerd filled with self-doubt, but apparently not lacking in cash: he lives in an apartment that his parents bought for him when he entered university. Nice. His oldest and best friend Alex couldn’t be more different: he’s outgoing and confident, easy to talk with and popular with the ladies, though he’s also flighty—a love ‘em and leave ‘em type—lives in a kip with two other fellas, is perpetually late and reserves his moments of self-doubt for private times with David. The girl that comes between them, Camille, is beautiful and confident as well, so easy with her beauty that she appears to have an aura; but we’re told very little else about her.The plot is basic: David sees Camille across the room at a party, and falls in love (at first sight). He enlists Alex to break the ice and make an introduction, but Camille is more attracted to Alex’s self-confidence and they become “a couple”. David feels betrayed and sulks for the next two-hundred and fifty pages: through graduation, job interviews, early success with work, an extended holiday in Brazil (of all places), a dramatic new career path; David sulks. After an initial period where their friendship is strained because of the perceived betrayal, Alex invites David to spend time with him and Camille: at bars and for dinner, picnics and bowling. Over and over again, which I thought odd: someone should have realised enough already. It wouldn’t be David to realise it, of course; he’s still carrying a torch for Camille, thrilled to near her, in her circle, in spite of the pain and lingering resentment. Or perhaps because of it, so he could nurture and feed his whinging and self-pity.(view spoiler)[As time passes, however, Alex begins to feel trapped in the relationship; it’s more than he wants. In spite of his history of taking on new and exciting things only to chuck them off when the next shiny object appears, he seems dedicated to working in film, even if as a dogsbody on shoots for television adverts. As Alex becomes more involved in film and theatre, he begins to leave his old friends behind. David seems to think as a way to get out of the relationship. So when he meets Alex by accident in an after-hours place amongst a crowd of theatre people, a pretty young one of whom is being very friendly, David confronts his lifelong friend about his bad behaviour.And then David does the shitty thing: he tells Camille what he’s seen, about Alex and the theatre girl, and gets her to go to bed with him. He permanently ruptures his life-long friendship, and though Camille realises her mistake, David is willing to lie in wait until she comes around again. Presumably they live happily ever after; we never know: The End. (hide spoiler)]If this dénouement had come in the middle of the novel, Binchy might have been able to examine what it all meant. Unfortunately, these characters never “grow”: they are just as shallow and self-centred at the end of the novel as at the beginning. And though the novel is nominally set in Dublin, aside from an occasional mention of “Trinity” or certain streets, there is nothing “Irish” about it at all. We know there are lots of pubs.Overall, Five Days Apart is a disappointment. (The title is never referenced or explained.) The setting is anonymous; the characters thinly drawn (especially Camille—besides being beautiful, we know nothing about her, what she does or studied). The protagonist’s most dramatic moment goes unexamined. And yet I stayed up late to finish it. Binchy writes well enough to keep the pages turning, but just; perhaps there was always the hope that on the next page there might be “more”.

The authors were cousins, women of the Anglo-Irish Protestant Ascendancy who nevertheless write from the point of view of the eponymous (male) Resident Magistrate. There’s a bit of “Upstairs/Downstairs” about it, but it’s very sympathetic to the native population even while it pokes fun and is somewhat patronising. Indeed, while the “locals” provide a cast of humorous background figures, the majority of the satire is saved of the members of their own class, the “quality”, whose foibles (particularly the spectacle of fox hunting) are dissected with charming precision. I certainly laughed out loud at least once in each of the twelve chronological stories included in this collection.Edith Oenone Somerville (1858-1949) was from Castletownsend, Co. Cork, and descended from Scottish Normans who were “planted” in Ireland in the seventeenth century at the end of the Cromwellian Wars; Violet Martin (1862-1915) was from the estate of Ross (from whence she derived her nom de plume), in Co. Galway. By the time they met in 1886, the fortunes of both families were significantly diminished, and they wrote as much for the money as for any other reason. Roughly contemporary with W.B. Yeats, Lady Gregory and other luminaries of the “Celtic Revival”, they were well aware that their stories chronicled a way of life that was passing into history. Their main character, Major Sinclair Yeates, a well-bred and partly Irish Englishman, is one of their own really. Though we aren’t given too much backstory for the Major, he has recently retired from the British army to take up a post as Resident Magistrate in West Cork, a position secured for him by his fiancée Philippa’s connections; she will join him after their nuptials. At least once in the text, the Major specifically identifies himself as Irish; this, I think is significant to under- standing the cultural milieu in which the stories are set. As mentioned, the depiction of the “natives” is patronising (certainly by modern standards) but never (it seems to me) racially nor ethnically derisive. Indeed, for the most part, the “quality” were in fact the patrons; they were the landed gentry: down in the heel as their houses and clothing and even livestock may have been, they had the land, and it was from the land that everyone in the district ultimately derived their livelihoods. We could file this book as an historical anomaly, especially compared with contemporaneous works of Yeats and Synge. But it is a glimpse at a time passed, and perhaps provides some background for later works, particularly the endless fascination of the “Big House” in Irish literature and culture....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jun 13, 2011","Jun 23, 2011","Jun 13, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3789302-some-experiences-of-an-irish-r-m

I myself am after just finishing said novel by a fellow named Flann O'Brien (well, actually Brian O'Nolan—in English that is, Brian Ó Nualláin, as Gaeilge, of which he was a native speaker) called At Swim-Two-Birds. It's the story of an unnamed dissolute university student who prefers above all to spend his life in the comfortable confines of his bed in an upper room of the Dublin house of his long-suffering guardian/uncle, a man of simple and clean habits both mental and physical, employed by the Guinness brewery—clerk third-class—rather than in lecture halls or libraries; at a stretch, our student/narrator will emerge to visit the Commons rooms of the University College or those public houses frequented by students and other citizens. But while a-bed he writes a novel about a novelist named Dermot Trellis who similarly prefers to spend his life in bed, though in a flea-bag hotel dubbed the Red Swan; the novelist's characters, whom he forces to live with him in other rooms of the hotel, feel generally ill-used and put upon, their lives wasted waiting for the brief appearances on the page, each resentful of Trellis's control over their destinies. In order to give themselves the freedom to lead quiet domestic lives in the suburbs of Rathgar and Ranelagh rather than be ruled by the lurid plots of his novels, they manage to drug him so that he will spend more time asleep. When Trellis creates a sister for one character in order that another might seduce her, their communal outrage explodes; when Trellis—""blinded by her beauty so far forgets himself as to assault her himself""—and actually impregnates that character, they know things have gone too far.And so with the aid of a Pooka (the anglicised spelling of the Irish púca, usually translated ""goblin"") who turns the issue of that union, Orlick Trellis, against his father, the idea comes to them to write a novel in which they excoriate and berate Trellis père and inflict all manner of mayhem both physical and psychological upon him. And that’s leaving out all the poetry and a slew of other characters. And it’s hysterically funny. Read it slowly, listen to the voices talking. Hysterical.It's been called the first ""post-modern"" novel, in part because of its self-referential nature, intertexuality and emphasis on the epistemology of the text itself (the novel within a novel within a novel). (I myself think it's actually pre-post-modern.) It was published in 1939, just a few months after Finnegans Wake, though only 260 or so copies were sold before the printer's storehouse was bombed in the Blitz. But I don't think this is going to help you: You’ll have to read it yourself.

She dreams of improving her situation: of one day riding a fabulous white horse, dressed in finery and adored by the throng. Her immediate models however are the prostitutes who ply their age-old trade based around the ""Seven Dials"" near Covent Garden in London's West End. And indeed Mary soon takes up the trade herself, exchanging her virginity for a bright red ribbon similar to one that graces a ""stroller"" named Doll Higgins, who takes Mary under her wing and shows her the ropes.Emma Donoghue has recreated a vanished world, yet one not so unfamiliar.

There she goes ""into service"" in the home of her mother's childhood friend, Jane Jones, and her husband: striving stay- and dressmakers for the local gentry. But though she attempts to put her old life as a prostitute behind her, ambition and greed compromise her better intentions.You could call this a feminist novel: the portrayals of servitude in a variety of characters (servants, slaves, nurses and mistress as well) paint a picture of empowerment denied. Be that as it may, the novel is not polemical; Donoghue writes with authority, wit and charm.

The ""nice old man"" of the title isn't really all that nice but neither so evil that the appellation could be considered ironic or facetious. The pretty young girl is mostly a cypher: we learn nothing about her, save that she's twenty-years old, drives a tram, and is pretty. She's uneducated, but probably no more or less so than her contemporaries (she can read and write, although only in the local dialects). Set in Trieste during the First World War, when all the young men are off fighting and those left behind suffer from war-time privations, il Vecchio plies la Fanciulla with food. And she's quite willing to be seduced, though whether she genuinely likes older men or it's merely a case that they are the only men available isn't explored.The greater part of the book happens in the old man's apartment, indeed within his head. He suffers pangs of guilt (though for what exactly we're left to imagine: nothing more graphic than kissing is explicitly mentioned) which manifests itself as angina. He takes to his bed, broods, fights with his physician and housekeeper, and stays away from the girl for months at a time. Finally, he gets the idea that he should write a treatise on the mutual duties and responsibilities of the young and old to each other. And then he dies, these questions unresolved.Ettore Schmidt was a fairly well-to-do businessman in Trieste at the turn of the last century, who decided to take English lessons at the Berlitz school there; the young teacher assigned to his was named James Joyce. In the years before the First War, they became great friends. Some speculate that Schmidt was at least partially a model for Leopold Bloom: Schmidt was—like Bloom—a non-practicing Jew, living in an overwhelmingly Catholic city at the edge of an empire (the Austro-Hungarian at the time). He also had literary ambitions, which Joyce amongst others encouraged. Under the pen-name Italo Svevo (literally ""an Italian Swabian"") he published a number of works, and I was looking forward to getting into his new author via this pleasant-looking novella.Things started out well: il Vecchio first notices the girl on a wild tram ride across the city. I found it quite engaging, but soon the action (as it were) moved to the apartment, and then stopped altogether.

A lovely young woman, bright, articulate, the daughter of one of the 1950’s Dublin’s most prominent surgeons and an Irish-American princess à la Grace Kelly, she works in a Grafton Street hat shop. By choice. Yet in Christine Falls, the first novel by Benjamin Black (the nom-de-plume of Booker Prize-winning Irish novelist John Banville), Phoebe discovers that she was in fact adopted by her parents, and that her beloved curmudgeonly uncle, Quirke, is in fact her father; Quirke’s wife, her natural mother, died in childbirth and she was given by her grieving father to his sister- and brother-in-law to raise. But not only that, she discovers her two grandfathers—both powerful men on opposite sides of the Atlantic—are involved in an illegal international adoption ring, which lead to the death of the title character. And then Phoebe’s raped.In The Silver Swan, the first sequel, Quirke investigates the death by drowning (apparently) of the wife of a former schoolmate. But once again dark doings are happening beneath the benign fog and mists of mid-century Dublin. And once again Phoebe is tangentially involved with the same people Quirke is investigating. In fact she takes one of the prime suspects (because the woman was not in fact drowned) as a lover—though quite unbeknownst to her, as her relationship with her father is strained. When he winds up impaled on the wrought-iron fence in front of her flat at the novel’s dénouement, she once again becomes the victim of circumstance.And now, Phoebe’s friend April Latimer has gone missing. Or so it would seem, because no one has reported the fact officially. Phoebe can’t help but to think something isn’t right, and this time she goes directly to Quirke, who wastes no time dawdling around, invoking the aid of his friendly neighbourhood Garda inspector, Hackett. But their probing isn’t appreciated by April’s family: neither her brother, a striving young physician, nor her uncle, the Minister for Health, nor her mother, the widow of a hero of the 1916 Rising. This triumvirate block all attempts at investigation, noting how April had removed herself from the family and was such a free spirit she might be anywhere.No one believes them, and rightly so. It isn’t until Quirke and Hackett are on the verge of exposing a hidden history of child molestation and incest at the highest levels of Dublin society, that the facts are revealed, even if they go, uncorroborated, to the grave with the murderer.Mr. Black, it's time to leave poor Phoebe alone. She'll be a basket-case (if she isn't already) what with rape in the first book, death by wrought-iron fence in the second and now another suicide before her very eyes, this time by exotic British motor-car and cliff.

Now I’ve come to expect these, indeed look forward to them; the thrill now comes from finding the literary nods and winks, the wild meanderings through art and philosophy as well as the damaged and defective characters—and of course the delicious language for which Banville is so well known. In his Benjamin Black books, however, things are a little more plain and straight-forward. This short book, originally serialised in The New York Times Magazine, is Black’s first work set in contemporary time, and in New York City, rather than 1950s Dublin. It also gives us a new protagonist: John Glass, a professional journalist turned first-time biographer, hired specifically to write the authorised life story of his father-in-law, William “Wild Bill“ Mulholland.Not untypical for Banville, many of the characters are loosely based on a real-life people: Mulholland’s history is clearly based on that of “Wild Bill” Donovan—founder of the OSS (precursor to the CIA); his daughter Louise (Glass’s wife) seems drawn at least partially from the actress Angelica Huston. (Her real-life father, film director John Huston—a naturalised Irish citizen—makes a cameo appearance to announce the main theme of the book.) Naturally, there are skeletons to be found in the closet of a master spy turned business mogul, though they will certainly never be revealed in an authorised biography. Before any in-depth research can start, Glass (perhaps) hires Dylan Riley, the eponymous “lemur” according to Glass‘s first impression, a research assistant who winds up dead a few pages in. Riley is a techie geek, smarmy and derisive; the type who graduated from ‘Dungeons & Dragons’ to real-life electronic cloak-and-dagger stuff without fully realising the physical threats.Banville/Black seems to have most fun in this novella with names. Glass is, despite his reputation as a world-class investigative journalist, quite clueless. My immediate impression was not that he was Irish, but rather Jewish—an impression no doubt derived from the famous family featured in most of J.D. Salinger’s fiction. The “Wild Bill” connexion is, as mentioned, obvious; the Mulholland may be a nod to the neo-noir film Mulholland Drive. A single reference to Mulholland’s first wife, a film actress of the ‘40s named Vanessa Lane, seems to evoke Veronica Lake. The police captain leading the investigation into the “Lemur’s” death is named Ambrose, like the former light-ship which stood off the entrance to New York harbour, guiding generations of mariners to safe moorings. And finally Mulholland’s protégé and secret saviour Charlie Varriker made me think of the Irish physician-turned-politician Leo Varadkar, recently elevated to a Minister in the current Fine Gael/Labour government.Ultimately, as the details of the cover-up which required the Lemur’s murder unfold, Glass realises that he completely missed the point; that he “lost the plot” as the Irish say. He’s reminded, as we are, of the advice John Huston gave him years ago in wilds of the West of Ireland: “If you don’t know who the patsy in the room is, it’s you.” ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Apr 03, 2011","Apr 25, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2798062-the-lemur

The opening pieceMore than anything else I’ve read by Colm Tóibín, this collection of short stories covers a wide range of interests and experiences. The opening piece features two real-life historical personages, Lady Augusta Gregory (who would go on to help found the world’s first “national theatre“, Ireland‘s Abbey Theatre) and the American-British author Henry James. Lady Gregory’s musings about the nature of marriage and her relief at being widowed stake out just one of the many forms of “family” Tóibín means to evoke in these stories.In the title story, a man (with characteristics and life-history uncannily similar to the author’s) fills a small house near the Wexford sea-side with “treasures” accumulated in his many travels. The house is not far from where he was raised and though various family members will visit, they bring no more meaning to the place than the various bibelots on display.I was surprised (in my innocence) by the frankness of Tóibín’s references to homoerotic sex—I guess I’ve never previously encountered the subject in serious literature. My favourite story is one I’d read previously, in the New Yorker: Paul is a prosperous young Dublin man called home to Enniscorthy on the illness of his elderly “aunt”. It was this aunt in fact who raised him: his natural mother, addicted to the bottle, was unable to care for him and fled to England. What starts out as a medical emergency turns into a long-term care arrangement: as the aunt recovers from the immediate concern, it becomes apparent she must be relocated from her house—her life-long home—to a nursing home. And though the aunt recovers and at first flourishes when surrounded by generous carers and her own contemporaries, her time has come: she begins to decline and slowly, patiently almost, slips away. Her one concern is, oddly enough, that Paul will not return to his natural mother. Who in fact, has returned to the town after a lifetime drying out in England. And when the question is finally and painfully raised, which is more important, nature or nurture, Paul chooses nurture and rejects the existence of his natural mother.I would challenge Tóibín’s assessment that this was an “empty” family, though it certainly is irregular. Or so it seems. I think perhaps there are more irregularities than “model” families.

I worked in the mail room of a large engineering company located at 2 Rector Street, right behind Trinity Church, and every morning my dad and I would take the PATH train over from Jersey City to lower Manhattan. The station is in the basement of the World Trade Center. And one morning as we came out onto the street, everyone—in very uncharacteristic fashion, for this is New York City—was looking up. Up into the sky, where there was what appeared to be a man on a wire between the two towers.It hit so many right notes for me. I don't know if McCann was really any good at descriptions—at least of place—because I knew almost all of the places he described. From the Sandycove Strand in Dublin to public housing projects under the Major Deegan in the South Bronx. And of course the World Trade Center. But he is without doubt brilliant at creating voices. Each part of the book is told by a different character (or by an omniscient narrator), from a different point in time. The opening and longest section describes the life and work of John A. ""Corrie"" Corrigan, as told by his older brother, Ciaran. Corrigan is a brother in some unnamed Catholic order and was sent to New York to live and work among the poor, just doing ""good deeds"", proselytizing by example; living a simple, Spartan, Franciscan life among the prostitutes and pushers of the South Bronx. His relationship with his ""flock"" (a word neither he nor they would consider using), the lives he touched in his brief time in New York, is one of the main threads that runs throughout the book.Another important character is Clair Soderberg, who we would once have called a Park Avenue matron (does the ""type"" still exist?). The wife of a municipal court judge, she grieves for the loss of her only child, killed in the dying days of the Vietnam War. She too is touched by Corrigan's life and work, though casually, without knowing it. Others who get their moment are Tilly Henderson, one of the prostitutes; Lara, an artist and Village bohemian; a young would-be tagger and budding photojournalist; a group of geeks somewhere in California in the process of inventing the Internet; Gloria, a friend of Clair and resident of the projects; Clair's husband, Judge Soderburg; and Jaslyn Henderson, Tilly's granddaughter, speaking from 2006 and pulling together the various threads.But of course the overarching character, who touched all the lives above and so many more (mine included) is the one real-life person in the novel: Philippe Petit, the man who walked along a wire strung a quarter-mile above the world between the towers of the World Trade Center, 7 August 1974. Now, more than thirty-five years later, it's difficult to remember what I remember of that morning, as opposed to what I've seen and read in all the many intervening years.There were just a few missteps, perhaps all the more glaring because they were so few. For one, I doubted the veracity of Corrigan's brother referring to him as ""Corrigan""—which of course was his own last name. Within families, childhood names stick. Also, when Lara collects Corrigan's personal effects, she looks in his wallet to find his address and makes some comment about the photo on his driver's license: ""I stared at the license. He looked younger than my freeze-frame memory had made him. A pair of oddly frightened eyes, looking way beyond the camera.""

She gives Trevor Stratton, a visiting American, ""the office with the tall useless empty file cabinet in the corner."" But in that useless filing cabinet, she also leaves a small box of mundane artefacts for him to discover at his leisure; a box which proves to tell a remarkable story. Stratton becomes obsessed with the artefacts, and what he is able to learn about their original owner, a woman named Louise Brunet (née Victor): born at the end of the nineteenth century, she found and lost love during the First World War, married a stable but rather stodgy after the peace, and lived the rest of her life in a flat at 13, Rue Thérèse in the 1er arrondisement. As Stratton pieces together Louise's story, we the readers are also allowed to see the love letters, photographs and other trinkets that held some special significance to the original owner. There are images throughout the book (and hyperlinks to the book's website for larger versions of the images).And so there are two plots, simultaneous and related: the current day plot of Trevor finding the artefacts and the story of Louise and her husband and her lovers. Louis's story is not chronological: the plot weaves back and forth through her life, from when she's a young woman, to the autumn of 1928, to her girl-hood, to the death of her brother in the Spanish 'Flu pandemic of 1918; dictated, it would seem, by the order in which Trevor investigates her effects.Trevor and Josianne also become lovers. Josianne lives in a flat in the same building that Louise occupied, at 13, Rue Thérèse. But, in a twist of magical realism, Trevor also meets Louise at various points in her life, like a time traveller, transported back to November 1928, back to December 1918, back to the killing fields of Flanders during the Great War.In an afterward, the author relates some of her own story. She lived in a flat at 13, Rue Thérèse. She was only a girl when the real Louise Brunet died, a widow without any relatives. The owner of the building, needing to clean out the flat, opened the doors to the other tenants, inviting them to take what they wished.

Because ultimately, the ""students"" of Hailsham and their ilk are no different from any of us: just on an accelerated path. If there is a hopelessness, a certain sense of inevitability which is accepted, how is that any different from our own? Perhaps the greatest difference is that the ""students"" are conscious of it in a way that we, the so-called ""normals"" are able somehow magically to ignore. None of us gets out alive.I wish I hadn't known the basic premise behind the book, but with the recent release of the film and the attendant s and discussions in the media, it was difficult to overlook. Ishiguro very carefully controls the release of information, so that we are treated much as the ""students"" are: we are ""told and not told"" simultaneously. And the narrator, Kathy H., is obviously addressing her tale to some other ""student"": she frequently says, ""I don't know how it was where you were, but at Hailsham…""; she's addressing someone who is intimate with the facts of ""student life"", and we—the general readers—are not really considered. It is as if we are reading someone's diary, where various allusions and references are assumed.There are no particularly strong characters in this book. Kathy, for all her good intentions and apparent competence in her role as a ""carer"", would be quite dull at a dinner or cocktail party. Her concerns, and those of her most intimate friends, Ruth and Tommy, are very narrowly focused. Some parts of her narrative were excruciatingly dull. This was quite an accomplishment for the author, because the dullness is paradoxically what drives the plot. I came to think of Kathy as simply naïve, a simple soul.""Soul"" is a funny word, given the context attributed to it in the book.

The details surrounding Maskell's life roughly correspond to a conflation of Anthony Blunt (1907-83), who was exposed in 1979 as a former Soviet spy, and the Belfast-born poet, Louis MacNeice (1907-63). The form of the novel is a fictionalised memoir, written out by Maskell in the last year of his life, detailing his rise from Cambridge undergrad in the early '30s to member of the Royal Household as Surveyor of the King's Pictures and leading figure in British art history (Indeed, I have one of Blunt’s books, Baroque and Rococo Architecture and Decoration, gracing my shelves, one of the few remaining from my grad school days.) This is Banville's longest novel, and in a way, the most focused (in terms of plot), deriving as it does from historical figures and incidents. But the roman à clef mode simples serves as an armature upon which Banville constructs diverse meditations on art, friendship, loyalty, authenticity, patriotism, academia, family and so many of the other topics which defined and defied the tumultuous twentieth century.And as always, Banville prose is luminous and delightful, poetically effervescent: sticking one's nose in a Banville book the bubbles practically tickle it. Though I was slightly shocked by how much he appropriated from Blunt's life, the book is not of course about the ""facts""—be they fictional ""facts"" or factual ""facts""—it's about how they are presented and developed. The facts surrounding a life do not make a character, particularly a literary character. Nor does it put the type of ruminations into the head of a narrator as Banville does.

Lucette, a tragically (and quite humorously) romantic nineteen year old decides to marry and have a child, a child that will live a most extraordinary life. When her husband suggests the names Tanguy or Joëlle, she realises she's chosen the wrong man, a man of no imagination. So she shoots him. In prison, her baby is born and baptised after an obscure saint: Plectrude. That should send the babe on her way in life! Convinced her work is done, Lucette hangs herself in her cell, bequeathing the child to her older sister, already married with two children.Ah, but the older sister shares some of the magic Lucette envisioned for her child, and raises her in a fairy-tale world, literally treating her like a princess, keeping her from school as long as legally possible. And Plectrude is not only gorgeous, but highly intelligent and extremely talented. At five she asks for dancing shoes; at thirteen, she enters the Paris Opera ballet school, an institution described as a ""scalpel to slice away the last flesh of childhood"". What happens after that is the darker side of the fairy tale.I'd never heard of Nothomb until I picked this book up on the ""sale"" table at the library this afternoon.

The main fellow, who is very creepy, almost gangster-ish, is named Morden (no first name); he's supposedly a real estate developer, bought this 18th Century town house in Dublin, which is where he discovered the paintings, apparently by chance. He has a driver/henchman (at least that's the way he's portrayed) named Francie; there's also a young woman only identified as ""A."" Freddie and A. have an intense love affair, that becomes apparent almost immediately, so it's not giving anything away to say so. We don't learn what A.'s relationship is to Morden or how she fits into that scheme of things until the final pages. I assume ""Athena"" represents A., although probably other things as well.Now, flash forward to 2005 (in real life, not the story) to Banville's Booker Prize-winning novel The Sea. In that, a retired man moves into a guest house by the seaside in Ireland, near where he stayed as a boy. His wife, Anna, has recently died, and he's sort of lost and floating, not really knowing what to do with himself and how to handle the loss of Anna and memories of his childhood and events that happened at the guest house long, long ago. The man was an art historian. His name is Max Morden.The Morden of The Sea and the Morden of Athena are not the same character. (Though I looked for clues throughout the reading, frustratingly so.) The Morden of Athena asked Morrow if he had any siblings: neither of them do, apparently. But they're all liars: the ""good guys"" (Freddie M. is a notoriously unreliable narrator) as well as the gangsters.Another curious character in Athena (albeit a minor one) is a police inspector named Hackett. We can presume that Athena takes place roughly in ""the present"" (or at least the time the book was published in the mid-'90s), although no times or dates are mentioned (in fact no location is mentioned either, but from various clues we can safely assume the setting is Dublin). We know from piecing together the clues left throughout this book as well as Ghosts (the second installment in the trilogy), that Freddie served a number of years in prison for the murder of a young housekeeper in the course of stealing a painting from the estate of some wealthy acquaintances (depicted in the original of the trilogy, The Book of Evidence). Thus is the nature of a trilogy: the stories are interrelated, and in this case at least, chronological.Finding Morden's name is something of a surprise: that this character's name should surface again in the writer's opus a decade later is startling. Hackett though is even more surprising. His name (and career) surfaces in 2008 in Banville's mystery novel The Silver Swan, published under the name of his crime-fiction-writing alter ego, Benjamin Black. That novel is set in Dublin in the grey and stifling 1950s. It is impossible to consider these two detectives are the same person—forty years have passed: pensions and gold watches have been distributed at boozy testimonial dinners surely. Could it be that the Inspector Hackett of Athena is the son of the Inspector Hackett who indulges Black's quirky pathologist Garrett Quirke? Holy intertextuality, Batman. The book is brilliant, in that ""Banville way""—I loved it. Athena is the steamiest thing I've read by Banville: the girl, A., is into transgressive sex. She's slender and not as young as she seems and has dark, blue-black hair. Banville owes at least some nominal debt to Nabokov's Lolita for his portrait of Freddie's self-destruction under the thrall of A. It's the first novel by Banville I can remember having any erotic content: others have had ""sex scenes"" (Shroud in particular comes to mind) but they were somewhat mechanical, most likely deliberately so.The chapters, unnumbered and unnamed, alternate with brief (fictional) critiques of the (fictional) paintings by (fictional) artists. This is not Banville writing the critiques, but rather Freddie, which becomes apparent about a third of the way in, when he breaks the scholarly ""fourth wall"" and addresses A. directly, as ""you"". Indeed, randomly throughout the book, Freddie's narrative turns away from the ""general reader"" and he aims his tale of woe, his comments specifically to A., specifically to ""you"". It's a brilliant conceit. The change in ""person"" is jarring; it's just subtle enough to constantly catch one every time.And what of the paintings? Are they real or fake? If real, they are inestimably valuable—and stolen. Stolen from the same collection where Freddie got into trouble originally, in The Book of Evidence. It almost doesn't matter, because the paintings are Banville's MacGuffin, setting off Freddie's ruminative flights of longing and loss....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Feb 08, 2011","Feb 14, 2011","Feb 07, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3660.Athena

The Stray Sod Country is set in the relatively tranquil and boring year of 1958 in the border town of Cullymore (a thinly disguised Clones, Co. Monaghan, McCabe's hometown). Laika, the Russian dog, is orbiting the earth; the football world is reeling after the Munich air disaster claimed the lives of a good portion of the Manchester United team. And in Cullymore, resentment seethes under a thin veneer of tolerance and neighbourliness.Geraldine Murray wishes her husband would interfere with the brakes of her uppity Protestant neighbour Blossom Forster. James Reilly, banished from the town to a rubbish tip, plots revenge and polishes his father's Civil War-era Enfield. Father August Hand obsesses with jealousy over the successes of a former fellow-seminarian. Happy Carroll, a most unhappy carpenter, turns informer against the IRA. The bachelor Protestant dentist buys kisses, if not more, from teen-aged girls. All these thoughts and actions are so atypical: it seems some outside force compels this aberrant behaviour. It takes a while for this book to find the thread. In the first dozen pages it seems as if dozens of characters are introduced, dozens of subplots set in motion by the omniscient third-person narrator. It isn't until the sixtieth page that the narrator steps out of the shadows to reveal himself. And who is he? His names are legion: Nobodaddy, the Fetch, Old Nick, Satan. He waits and watches and pulls strings that tug at emotions and psyches of his hapless play-things. Leading them all eventually to the ""Stray Sod Country"". One character, explaining the significance of stepping on a ""stray sod"", tells how the person has a feeling of ""being lost in what once were reassuring surroundings. Being intimidated, confused — by the very thing that once made you feel secure."" This alienation, this ""cosmic loneliness"", terrifies the tight-knit townsfolk: all the more so because of their suffocating togetherness. And this then is McCabe's real subject: for those feelings of ""cosmic loneliness"" are not peculiar to small Monaghan towns in 1958. They are if anything, a ""cosmic constant"", a natural state of the human condition.

In the first place, the eponymous characters, the brother-and-sister authors Charles and Mary Lamb (1775-1834 and 1764-1847 respectively) were not the main characters of this story. That honour belonged to one William Henry Ireland (1775-1835), famous as a forger of Shakespearean articles, including a complete play, Vortigern and Rowena, which was actually produced. The majority of the book tells the tale of Ireland’s attempts to foist his handiwork on an unsuspecting public. That he was a contemporary of the Lambs there is no doubt; whether or not he even had any dealings with them has no basis in fact. As it is, many facts are obscured or ignored, most disturbing of all being Mary Lamb’s death at the end of the book—before her brother, whom she actually outlived by some dozen years. Equally preposterous, Mr Ackroyd attributes Mary Lamb’s contribution to their co-authored Tales from Shakespeare (a children’s book which simplifies the language and plots of twenty plays) to Thomas de Quincey, the essayist best known for his Confessions of an English Opium Eater.But this book is a work of fiction, not of history or biography. The conjoining of the story of Shakespeare’s most infamous forger with his perhaps his most famous interpreters (at least for children) is a delightful and clever conceit. The language is plain, the descriptive exposition kept to a minimum. The picture of the hurly-burly of late eighteenth century London Ackroyd paints is appealing in its squalor and misery. In general, however, I was disappointed. Probably because of the title: I actually expected more about the Lambs, though I had no previous knowledge of the story of William Ireland.

The stories generally fall into two categories: a good half of them are narrated by pre-pubescent girls, still children but on the very cusp of adolescence, with the first inkling that there is more to the adult world than previously imagined. The other half are from the point of view of young women, embarked upon careers perhaps, or just back from their ""gap"", or even approaching the edges of middle age; they are still vulnerable (as we all are), but more wary and at the same time less fearful, more confident.There seemed to me to be a lot of ""widow-hood"" in these plots. Perhaps that is a feminist fantasy: love has not died, but that inconvenient lover has gracefully bowed out. That may sound harsh, but I don't mean it to be: I saw a very interesting flowering in my own mother after my father died, as she came into her own in ways that weren't necessary or possible previously.My favourite story in the ""widow"" genre was called ""Le soleil et le vent"".

And though astronomy was little more than an avocation, it was there he made his mark upon the world. With the publication of his De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres) just before his death in 1543, Copernicus marked a milestone in the history of science that is often referred to as the ""Copernican Revolution"".Banville divides his novel into four sections, each with a slightly different style and point-of-view. (Though the third section has a remarkably different style, written in the first person as a memoir of Copernicus by his student/amanuensis/flunky, Georg von Lauchan Rheticus, here presented as a highly unreliable narrator.) Other titans of renaissance learning and politics filter through the pages: Tiedemann Giese, Bishop of Kulm; Girolamo Fracastoro, the poet/physician who first identified syphilis and wrote on contagious diseases; Andreas Osiander, Lutheran theologian; as well as various prince-bishops, Polish kings and Teutonic Knights. For the life of a quiet cleric, there are some swashbuckling moments in Doctor Copernicus—armies and diplomats, whores and sodomites, priests and paupers populate the pages.But beyond the details of the polymath's life, is Banville's love of the language, in all its deliciousness. This early novel (it won the James Tait Black Award in 1976) shows many of the traits which have made Banville one of my favourite novelists.

This is the same father figure of The Barracks, The Dark and other earlier novels in McGahern’s works. Moran has alienated his eldest son permanently, and one-by-one each of the younger children fly the nest and flee the terror, though not without ""baggage"" of varying types. In his complete break with his father and the home place, the eldest son inherits a legacy of stubbornness. For each of the three daughters, however, the situation is more complicated. In spite of all, they are fiercely loyal to their father, his contempt for the greater society beyond his few acres of land and sense of superiority. Their terror and shame is mitigated ultimately by time and distance for the most part.And so it would seem is McGahern’s. While no less scathing a portrait of domination and oppression than in the earlier works, Amongst Women presents, if not a more sympathetic rendering, than at least a more nuanced one. As a veteran of the Irish War of Independence and Civil War, Moran himself feels oppressed by the condition of the state and nation he helped create. ""What did we do it all for?"" he asks. In taking both a longer and wider view of Moran and his personal history, McGahern comes to some kind of truce with the character that has dominated his fiction. It is not forgiving, but neither is it without understanding at some level.There is also a sense of ""comeuppance"". The beginning and end of the novel find Moran in his dotage, weakened and wearied by age and now in fear of his daughters and long-suffering second wife particularly. While his internal rage is undiminished, it is mitigated by a reluctant resignation that things have changed and things will not change.

Their relationship, however is strained: Vincent too, has become enamoured of Agnes, and Agnes would be only too ready to reciprocate, were it not for her incredibly deep sense of guilt over the pain a relationship with Vin would cause her sister. Their brother Reggie, an alcoholic and syphilitic ne'er-do-well, is unable to envision a future life without the protection and guidance of his mother; though the live-in day nurse, Miss Cunningham has a cure for that: she will marry Reggie in spite of his maladies, thereby securing herself a life of security if not love. The elder men of the house, Danny Mulqueen (their father), is beyond himself in grief, and Canon Considine, Teresa's brother, sequesters himself in private prayer. Oh they've each made ante-rooms of their own where together they wait alone.I couldn't help thinking that on the other side of the door from this ante-room was that lovely Second-Empire sitting room that provided the setting for Sartre's Huis Clos.An analogy could be drawn between The Ante-Room and John Banville's latest novel, The Infinites. We also have a country house in Ireland, with the family gathering to await the death of its leader: if only Agnes Mulqueen's god had come down off his cross and stirred up things the way Hermes did in The Infinites!The Ante-Room ends, as promised: with a death, even if not the one so anticipated. I wish I could have enjoyed the novel more, and will give Kate O'Brien another look (her two subsequent novels were banned in Ireland when originally published for their overt references to lesbianism); hopefully the language will be less affected with High Victorian verbosity....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jan 09, 2011","Nov 29, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1033511.The_Ante_Room

I found the stories which used an omniscient third-person narrator generally more compelling than those which seemed to be drawn from Lavin's own life, oddly enough, which leads me to believe that perhaps we (she and I) are just too different.

The plot follows What a wonderful book, a wonderful and unique perspective on the oft-written-about Irish War of Independence from Britain (1919-21). The plot follows a survivor of the trenches of the Western Front, one Major Brendan Archer, who following his heart (or at least his sense of duty to a young woman whom he met on a furlough early in the War), goes to her family's hotel on the coast of Co. Wexford. ""The Majestic"" is a bastion of the Protestant Ascendancy, the ruling class in Ireland for all the many centuries (at least since Henry VIII broke with Rome in 1538). But even before the eponymous ""Troubles"" (as the Anglo-Irish and subsequent Civil wars are known colloquially in Ireland), the Majestic had grown a little shabby, a bit down on its heal—the parallel between the hotel and the class who occupy it is not lost. The supposed object of the Major's affection, Miss Angela Spenser, does not last long, alas; Farrell relieves the Major of the duty of informing her that their youthful promise cannot be kept by having her die of leukemia.Remarkably, the Major ""stays on"" (cf. Paul Scott's Booker-Prize winning coda to his Raj Quartet Staying On about a British couple who remain in India after Independence in 1947). He's fascinated by the remains of Angela's family: her ne'er-do-well brother Ripon, her twin sisters Faith and Charity, but mostly her father, the widowed owner and manager of the Majestic, Edward Spenser. (Another footnote: the English poet Edmund Spenser wrote ""The Faerie Queene"" in nearby Enniscorthy, Co. Wexford.) At turns harsh and domineering though with a fanatical affection for his dogs and all the trappings of his class, Edward becomes unhinged at the thought of ""losing Ireland"" to the Papist rabble, personified by the ""Shinners""—the majority Sinn Féin revolutionaries.And then there is Sarah Devlin: an educated and cultured daughter of the town's bank manager, with a fiery personality, acid tongue and biting wit. Both the Major and Edward hold a candle for the young woman, and both are duly rejected. Not the least of which for the fact that she is Catholic, and it just doesn't work like that.An historical note: The Anglo-Irish War was not a conventional fight. Against the overwhelming manpower and firepower of the British Army (even on the foot of WWI), the Irish Republican Army conducted a guerrilla war, mostly under the command of Michael Collins; the British reacted by draughting former soldiers as Auxiliary police—the notorious and hated ""Black and Tans"" (a name based on their unusual combination of military surplus and police uniforms). The Black and Tans terrorised the populace, firebombing villages and towns, killing livestock and destroying crops, etc., in reprisal for the IRA insurgency. No attempt at winning hearts and minds there.As time goes on, the Major realises that the residents as well as owners of the Majestic are in an untenable position. As Edward becomes increasingly fixated on the military and political situation, he turns over more and more of the responsibility of running the Majestic to the Major (who is one of the few paying guests). And then there's the fact that the building is literally falling apart around their ears.If all this seems rather grim, it is tempered by Farrell's send-up of all involved: the Protestants' stultifying mores, the cool and clueless reserve of the one ""true Brit"" (the Major), the barely concealed contempt of the local indigenous populace (from whose ranks the servants at the hotel all come).This book, originally published in 1970, was awarded a Booker Prize this year. From Wikipedia:The Man Booker Prize for Fiction is a literary prize awarded each year for the best original full-length novel, written in the English language, by a citizen of the Commonwealth of Nations, Ireland, or Zimbabwe...[Beginning in 1968] the rules of the Booker changed in 1971; previously, it had been awarded retrospectively to books published prior to the year in which the award was given. In 1971 the year of eligibility was changed to the same as the year of the award; in effect, this meant that books published in 1970 were not considered for the Booker in either year.

And not particularly the Anglo-Irish Ascendency, nor even the quiet and resourceful small-town Protestants who were assimilated to a point (both whom William Trevor has so brilliantly chronicled in his ""big house"" tales and many other stories).

But I'm glad to see this finally translated into English. I sent away to the UK for a paperback copy in August because the US hardcover edition only came out in November, and the paper will be some time yet, and I simply couldn't wait.Saramgo's penultimate novel shares the ""historical fiction"" qualities of his first major success, Baltasar and Blimunda. The time is 1551. The King of Portugal and the Algarves, Dom João III and his queen, Dona Catarina (of Austria), are in bed, discussing what to get their cousin Maximilian, Archduke of Austria, for a wedding present. (An echo, probably unintended, of the beginning of the early Irish epic Táin Bó Cúailnge which also visits the marriage bed of Queen Medb and her consort Ailill.) Afraid to offend the Lutheran Maximilian with any gift too overtly Catholic, they settle on their elephant, Solomon. Solomon and his ""mahout"" (trainer/driver), Subhro, have languished for two years in relative anonymity since arriving in Lisbon from a Portuguese colony in India. All they need to do is clean up the pair, get them a military escort, and send them off to Valladolid where Maximilian is visiting his Spanish subjects.But Solomon's journey has only just begun when he reaches the Portuguese frontier. The trek across Spain, over the Baleric and Ligurian seas to Genoa, and then over the Alps to Austria will be long, arduous and sometimes perilous. In the interim, both Solomon and Subhro will lose their names (Maximilian has his own ideas—it's good to be the king, or at least the archduke), perform miracles and enchant most of those they meet. And Saramago will have ample time for numerous asides, to comment upon everything that comes to fertile and expressive mind.The ""plot"" of the novel is simple: an elephant walks from Lisbon to Vienna. The way it's told, however, is in classic Saramago style: reading it is like listening to a favourite uncle or grandfather tell a well-worn tale.

One is reminded of the title (if not the content) of Nancy Mitford's Love in a Cold Climate as McGahern's protagonists muddle their way through sex and romance on the rain-slicked footpaths of 1960s, '70s and '80s Dublin. Not that all the settings are urban though; even when the crux of the story takes place in ""the heart of the Hibernian metropolis"", there is always a connection to the rural West of Ireland.And indeed perhaps my favourite story of the entire collection, and written especially for it, was the last, ""A Country Funeral"". It tells of three brothers who return to the County Leitrim country-side of their forebearers in order to bury their mother's brother, a bachelor farmer. Vivid and violent memories are resurrected, which each brother deals with in their own fashion. But perhaps most surprising is the transformation of the middle brother, Philly, who after many years working in the oil fields of the Middle East, decides to purchase the family farm and return to roots which are barely his.This was the most mature McGahern, written a few years before his death, when his own life's journey had brought him and his American-born wife back to the Leitrim of his childhood. In a way ""A Country Funeral"" is not just about the death and burial of a man, but of a way of life that has almost completely vanished from contemporary Ireland. McGahern's own elegiac ""romance"" with this simpler, quieter time is more fully fleshed out in That They May Face the Rising Sun, his final novel....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Oct 22, 2010","Nov 08, 2010","Aug 04, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/458832.The_Collected_Stories_of_John_McGahern

Although born in England, Erskine Childers was raised in Ireland and educated both there and in Britain; after going down from Cambridge, he became a Parliamentary clerk, with a view of someday taking a seat in the Commons. He strongly supported the Liberal Party's efforts to pass the Home Rule bill for Ireland, and when they reneged at the outset of the first World War, he left the party and his hopes of becoming an MP.His love of the sea and sailing prompted not only this book, a fictionalised account of his own experiences sailing the North Sea, but also his next career step: as a member of the Irish Volunteers, he was called to service in the Admiralty and served in Galipoli as well as helping to establish a coastal motor-boat squadron off the coast of England.But by this time his credentials as an Irish Nationalist were well established. In 1914 he used his yatch, the Asgard, to illegally transport a shipment of guns from Germany to Howth. Sir Horace Plunkett had him relieved of service in 1917 to join the negotiating team in Dublin Castle furthering the attempts to establish Home Rule; this effort failed, and following a period of recuperation from the Spanish Influenza at his home in Glendalough, Childers was elected to the Second Dáil from Wicklow. A member of the Treaty Negotiations under Arthur Griffin and Michael Collins, he vehemently opposed the outcome, and fought on the Republican side in the Irish Civil War.In November 1922, he was arrested by the National Army whilst travelling to meet with De Valera; in a hurried military tribunal, he was tried, convicted and sentenced to death for possessing an illegal weapon: a revolver given to him by Michael Collins. While his appeal was being prepared, he was executed at the Beggar's Bush Barracks in Dublin. In the brief period before his, he told his 16-year old son, Erskine H. Childers (a future President of Ireland, 1973-74), to ""seek out and shake the hand of every man who had signed his...death warrant. Childers himself shook hands with each member of the firing squad that was about to execute him. His last words, spoken to them, were (characteristically) in the nature of a joke: 'Take a step or two forward, lads. It will be easier that way'.""Winston Churchill credited The Riddle of the Sands with prompting the Admiralty to create a North Sea fleet and the famous naval bases at Scapa Flow, Invergordon and Rosyth.

I enjoyed this book much more than the previous collection I read, Springs of Affection, in part because of the greater scope and greater opportunity for Brennan to express her talents. The twenty stories are divided subtly four groups, geographic rather than chronologic. The first are all centred around an enclave called Herbert's Retreat (based on the real-life Sneed's Landing in lower Westchester Co., some thirty miles north of New York City). These are bitingly satirical upstairs-downstairs stories of wealthy New Yorkers and their Irish maids, and frequently the tales twist on a certain glee in ""come-upance"". The next group are set in Ireland, among quiet and simple people, what we would call the lower-middle class or even perhaps the working-poor. (We do go on about class, don't we? Although in the States it's always based on income.) The few that follow the Irish stories are set in New York City, in a never-land of Brennan's own particular experience; but that's the case with all New York experiences, I suspect: no two are exactly alike, yet all seem familiar.The final group take place on Long Island, in a country cottage attached to a big house, a sprawling shingle-style summer resident of the Gilded Age. These stories feature a black Labrador named Bluebell owned by the tenant of the cottage, Miss Whitty, and a gaggle of children who inhabit big house on the hill. There's a certain wistfulness about the spinster and her animals and the children of other people.More than one story in this collection caused me to laugh out loud.

It's in the sprawling epic category, although it doesn't stray much further north than Drumcondra nor south of Dún Laoghaire; the Phoenix Park marks its western extremity and Dublin Bay is the east. Oh, there are mentions of Connemara and Cork, Liverpool and London, but those are place people will come from or go to. The real action takes place either in Kingstown (as Dún Laoghaire was then known) or within a few blocks of the Liffey: inside a circle which could be drawn with Liberty Hall at the centre and Parnell Square on the radius. A tight little world indeed for an epic.The cast of characters is expansive enough, however; mostly families. There are the wealthy Bradshaws: husband and wife occupying a handsome home in Kingstown with their two servants, the elderly Miss Gilchrist and young Mary; there is the de facto family group in the rectory of St. Brigid’s: the alcoholic Fr. Giffley, the sincere but dull Fr. O’Sullivan, and the priggish youthful Fr. O’Connor, transferred from Kingstown and a continuing link between the inner city and leafy suburb; then there is the extended clan at Number 3 Chandler’s Court, a rundown tenement within St. Brigid’s parish: Robert and Mary Fitzpatrick (she formerly in service to the Bradshaws), the Mulhalls across the hall, the Henneseys' layabout husband, shrewish wife and multitudinous children; and finally if you will, the beggar Rashers Tierney and his dog Rusty, also occupants of No. 3, if only the basement. We might also consider a larger family, even by Irish Catholic standards: the brotherhood of Big Jim Larkin’s Irish Transport and General Workers’ Union, of whom many of the above are members. There are, as might be expected in an epic, many walk-ons, including King Edward VII, Jim Larkin and James Connelly, a cheery handful of rozzers and rogues, the occasional hooer (with the requisite heart of gold), and on and on, with cameos by all the leading lights of the Celtic revival and beyond.No epic is worth the handle without an epic struggle, and this is the centre of the novel: The 1913 Dublin Lockout, when Labour and Management effectively closed down the entire city, throwing thousands of the poorest out of work, ruining innumerable businesses and setting the next stage in Ireland’s long struggle for independence. The novel begins in 1907, introducing the characters on the occasion of a rare royal visit, which gives plenty of opportunity for Plunkett to establish the political stance of each.Plunkett’s writing style is workmanlike, straightforward without being too flowery. In spite of the huge cast, the novel moves along at a brisk clip, driven as it is by historical events. I make no claim to verify the veracity of the history: the general outlines conform.

Loved O'Connor's Star of the Sea so I ordered it from Amazon.uk and my daughter brought it back with her from Cambridge.There are many ghosts haunting this story. The basic events take place mostly on a single day in 1952, where a somewhat aged, alcoholic actress well past her prime wanders around London killing time before a job she has doing a radio-play for the BBC World Service. In that time, as she stumbles in-and-out of an alcoholic fog, she reminices about the one true love of her life, who died young and left her to wonder about all the many what-might-have-beens. The actress is Molly Allgood (who used the name Maire O'Neill and was sister to the more famous Sara Allgood, who went to Hollywood and made films in 1920s, '30s and 40s). The lover is the playwrite John Millington Synge, who with William Butler Yeats and Lady Augusta Gregory, founded the Abbey Theatre, Ireland's National Theatre, as part of the ""Celtic Revival"" in the early years of the 20th-Century.That Allgood and Synge had some sort of relationship is historic fact; everything else is the fictional creation of Joseph O'Connor. Surely the young (eighteen-years-old when they met) Allgood was a muse to Synge—he wrote some of his finest female rôles for her. But they were star-crossed lovers as any in history: separated by age (he was thirty-five), religion and class, their relationship was never meant to be (and at least one of Synge's biographers believes it may not have been consumated). Such is the basis for O'Connor's speculations.Beside the ghost of Synge who haunts Molly's last days, there are many references—both subtle and obvious—to other literary and 'real' characters in early Edwardian Dublin: the ghost of James Joyce hovers near, both in borrowed characters and names, as well as in stylistic touches. And of course the presence of Yeats and Gregory float never too far away.I really enjoyed this, and will read it again, soon. I'm sure there are more fun and games to be found on closer reading.

And like the children in the novel, his mother died when he was very young.But this isn't a coming-of-age novel; the main characters are all adults, particularly the Sargeant, Reegan, and his second wife, Elizabeth. A veteran of the Irish War of Independence and its horric follow up, the Civil War, Reegan was a leader of men in his youth who idealistically joined the nascant nation's police service only to become embittered and disillusioned by the pettiness and officiousness of his superiors and the monotony of his duties in a quiet backwater in Co. Roscommon. In the stultifying moral atmosphere of 1950s Ireland, Reegan and Elizabeth has no outlet for their emotions which eat at their souls much like the cancer that Elizabeth contracts eats away at her body.Significantly, the majority of the novel is the interior monologue of Elizabeth. We learn of Reegan's reticence as well as his hopes and fears, from his wife. We learn next to nothing about Reegan's life outside the chronology of the book, but much about Elizabeth as a young nurse working in London during the Blitz and immediately afterwards.This is a powerful book, but seems somewhat dated. The Ireland that McGahern wrote about with such ferocity is no more.

And Trevor is uniquely placed amongst living Irish authors in relating them: born in 1928 to a lower middle-class Protestant household in that ""interregnum"" that was the Irish Free State (between the War of Independence/Civil War and 1937 Constitution leading ultimately to a Republic), his father was a bank clerk who was transferred from banch-to-branch during Trevor's childhood. How does a colonizing minority, those once in a position of power and privlege, adapt to a new popularism? Especially a minority who have been thoroughly assimilated. Unlike the European ""colonists"" of Africa and Asia—who always considered ""home"" to be the mother-country, regardless of how many generations were born and bred there—the Anglo-Irish experience is more complex and nuanced. ""More Irish than the Irish"" is the old saying: intermarriage with the indigenous gentry, a connexion with the land that rivalled (and sometimes surpassed) the ""natives"", sometimes a sense of noblese oblige—all these add layers of complexity to the experience.

I remember enjoying this very much when it came out in paperback, about ten years ago, but I'd forgotten just how much. Now that the third installment of Henry Smart's story, The Dead Republic, has been published, I thought I'd give myself a refresher. Wow. This is in my opinion the most ""mature"" novel of Roddy Doyle, in terms of plot and themes, character development, subplots and all that, but it still has the freshness and vibrancy that has marked almost all of Doyle's work. And that freshness and vibrancy is carried most forcefully by the dialogue: Roddy Doyle can write dialogue like no one else, and Dublin dialogue especially. Remember his first novel, The Commitments, was almost entirely dialogue. You can practically hear the neighbourhoods. The creation of another Dubliner, another Henry in fact (Shaw's Professor Higgins), would be proud.And for all these reasons, I avoided the second part of the trilogy, Oh, Play that Thing! I just couldn't imagine our Henry in my New York, in Chicago. Doyle writes Dublin so very well I'm afraid he'd be lost in America.

(Last year I read a collection of his short stories printed in the '50s, though I have no idea when they were written.) The style is somewhat stilted to my modern ears, but that may be a result of the time and place. Be that as it may, he certainly captured that time and place, or rather gave it an authenticity and immediacy. The setting is Dublin, c.1923. The Irish Civil War between the forces in favour of the Treaty with Britain and those opposing it has just ended. Those men and women who just a few years prior stood side-by-side as comrades-in-arms fighting the British have turned on each other, and even though open hostilities have ended (badly for the Anti-Treaty side), random acts of violence still occur. The ""Organisation"" (the Anti-Treaty IRA) have gone to ground.Gypo Nolan, the eponymous ""Informer"", reminds me of Lenny in Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men; as depicted by O'Flaherty, he's little more than a simpleton, all brawn and passion, unrestrained by logic or even feeling. He has a maudlin sentiment, true, but any real feelings have been purged by the hardships of life. Approached by his former partner, himself on the run, Gypo hardly hesitates a moment to sell the information of his whereabouts to the Free State police, the nascent Garda Síochána, for £20 (easily five-month's wages for a working man in today's terms). He's equally quick to betray a totally innocent man in an ill-advised effort to save himself.When the Organisation hears of the treachery, they immediately spring to action. If Gypo is all brawn, his opposite number, the Commandant Dan Gallagher, is all brain. Gallagher is similarly bereft of any sentimentality: all is for the preservation of the Organisation, and the Organisation is strictly a tool for the creation of an Irish workers' republic.Despite the faults of the antagonists, O'Flaherty is remarkably non-judgmental. He portrays the poor workers of Dublin's slums with passive equanimity: the prostitutes and pimps, consumptives and drunkards, con-men and revolutionaries, addicts and usurers are all presented with a casual aplomb that stands in marked contrast to the general perception we have of lace-curtain Irish ""propriety"".I'd like to think that the dialog, which is heavily weighted towards phonetic renditions of accent, is genuine, though at this remove (nearly 90-years since it was written) it has a certain ""stage Irish"" quality. I guess there's no way to know.Though melodramatic, the novel is also very cinematic. It's easy to see why it made such a memorable film (though John Ford did diddle a bit with the plot to make it more palatable to American sensibilities); if anything, it's a wonder that it has never been remade since 1935....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Feb 14, 2011","Feb 20, 2011","May 17, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/760325.The_Informer

I was heartened by various s that the book couThe Dead Republic is the third installment in a trilogy, the second part of which I did not read. I was heartened by various s that the book could stand alone, and while I was very glad that I'd read the initial installment (A Star Called Henry, 1999, which I enjoyed immensely), I seemed to muddle through the references to the second book without too much trouble. I got off to a shaky start: the first section of the book is set in Los Angeles and Monument Valley, Utah, where the narrator, Henry Smart, has become acquainted with the real-life Irish-American film director John Ford. Ford wants to tell Henry's story of the birth of an independent Ireland (from A Star Called Henry) but combined with a short story he read in 1933 about a Yank returning to Ireland called ""The Quiet Man"". As we know, there is no Henry Smart-character in Ford's post-card like film The Quiet Man; but that becomes part of the plot.Henry returns to Ireland with the film company in 1951 after almost thirty-years in the States, and stays. He returns to Dublin, takes a job as a school custodian in one of the new North Dublin suburbs (Doyle's home turf), and spends years in relative obscurity (he always was a rather obscure character, always on the fringe of the great events of 1916 and afterwards, Zelig-like, just out of the frame of the famous photographs, etc.) before he's an accidental victim of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 17 May 1974 (a series of car bombings in Dublin and Monaghan town which killed 33 civilians and wounded almost 300—the highest number of casualties in any single day during ""the Troubles"").As a result of the notoriety gained from a newspaper interview while he's recuperating in hospital, Henry is once again tapped by the I.R.A. in spite of his advanced age and physical limitations. (Like his father before him, he bears a wooden leg—not as a result of the bombing, but from an incident in the second book.) It is here that the novel takes off, after a gradual climb beginning with his return to Dublin. The earlier section of the book set in Los Angeles I found confused and dull, and I realise that was the point, that it described Henry's state of mind and well-being. But I didn't enjoy it.The remainder of the novel, which tracks Henry's progress (again, somewhat on the fringes) of the Republican movement in the North was much more satisfying. It's somewhat melodramatic, there are lots of convenient coincidences which Henry attempts to believe are all orchestrated by higher powers—not supernatural, just political and military—but we know are literary.One of the great charms of the original novel, besides the absolutely charming nature of the narrator, was the pacing: it literally ran. It wasn't until Doyle was back on Irish turf that he found his footing in this one, and the pace increased dramatically. It's a great yarn altogether; I'm not sure if I'll go back and attempt to read the second installment. One of my initial reservations about reading it was that it was set in the States, and after being somewhat disappointed with the section located there in this book, I'm afraid my reservations may have been justified....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Dec 23, 2010","May 16, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7476913-the-dead-republic

It was brilliant. Banville is a god. Or at very least, he knows how to channel one.The scene is a quirky Irish country house. The time is today-ish: Midsummer's Eve, more precisely. The characters are mainly the Godley family: Adam Snr, a theoretical mathematician who in his prime upset the balance of the universe with his great discovery; Ursula, his second (and much younger) alcoholic wife; Adam Jnr, their grown son; Petra, their twenty-something emotionally challenged daughter; Adam Jnr's wife, Helen, an actress; and a few ""friends of the family""—Ivy Blount, a dowdy spinster, last surviving member of the Protestant Ascendency family whose estate this once was (Ivy now occupies the gate lodge and works as a cook/helper and former nanny to the children); Roddy Wagstaff, the foppish 'boyfriend' of Petra, whose only interest in the her is access to Adam Snr so as to pursue his own career by writing a biography of him; Adrian Duffy, an illiterate local bachelor farmer who runs a few head of cattle on the land but also has designs on Ivy; and Benny Grace, a somewhat smarmy associate of old Adam who ingraciates himself upon the family.Oh yes, and the narrator. Hermes, the winged messenger of the gods, down from Olympus to guide us through the plot and act as pimp for his father, Zeus. Always good to have an omnicient narrator, even if he can be occasionally unreliable. And one other family member, the only one who actually can see and hear the gods flitting about the place: Rex, the dog. But he doesn't tell anyone.What brings this happy group together? Nothing less than old Adam's impending demise. For the senior Godley is in a coma, brought home from the hospital to die. He is ensconced in the upper-most room of the house (the ""Sky Room""), plugged in and hooked up to various medical equipment; he is totally immobile but maddingly concious—even hyper-concious—of all the events of the house.And so the scene is set for hilarity. This is a very funny book. It is rich and lush (the language might make one swoon). It's Shakespearean in many ways; it wasn't until nearly the end when it occurred to me that there was something of ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" about the easy intermingling of the gods and mortals. And definite allusions to its heirs, Sondheim's A Little Night Music and Woody Allen's A Midsummer Night's Sex Commedy.I loved it. I want to read it again. I won't go into the metaphysical aspects (entertaining as they are).

An unnamed boy is the only son of the widower Mahoney who ekes out a subsistance living on a small farm of land in the County Leitrim of 1950s Ireland. One can only speculate that the father's rage and hair-trigger temper spring from frustration and misdirected grief over the loss of his wife. But this is the son's story, though hardly your typical bildungsroman: McGahern's protagonist is tortured by his sexuality and the uniquely Irish-Catholic guilt it engenders, tortured by the repressive yet somehow secure teachings of his religion, tortured by his father's ignorance, posturing and rage, but most of all tortured by his own insecurity and indecision. Indeed security and insecurity are the overriding themes of the novel. Though the boy applies himself relentlessly to his studies and eventually wins a coveted scholarship to university, he tosses it all away when his grades also earn him a pat position as a drudge in the Electricity Supply Board. Even on the foot of a great personal acheivement, his insecurity bring him down afterall; down to a position more fitting with his own self-image.

That the narrator is suave, educated and erudite—a somewhat accidental murderer—is both charming and disarming; within the first few pages, I was reminded of the structure of Nabokov's Lolita. Indeed, Freddie Montgomery shares quite a few traits with good ol' Hum, not the least of which is an unhealthy dose of unreliability as a narrator.

The first segment are the most autobiographical, from the point of view of a young girl and her siblings living in a terrace house in the near South-side Dublin suburb of Ranelagh in the early 1920's, as did Brennan. And while the family examined in the second part, Hubert and Rose Derdon have but one son (a priest who appears largely 'off-screen') are very unlike the family in the first group of stories, they seem to inhabit the same house: the view out the back window, over the low wall of the garden towards a tennis club and past a garage, are exactly the same. Unlike the father in the initial stories (who's work goes unexplained—Brennan's own father was a diplomat and politician in the early days of the Irish Republic) Mr. Derdon works quietly away in a men's clothing store in Grafton Street, one of the main shopping streets in the centre of Dublin south of the Liffey. His wife Rose, a country girl brought to the heart of the Hibernian metropolis upon marriage, is a strange creature altogether; she's passionate but demure and lives in what very well may be her own fantasy world.In many ways she is not dissimilar from Delia Bagot, the wife in the last section of the stories, who also comes from a rural County Wexford background. Like the other mothers in all the stories, she lives for the children (her husband is not so emotionally remote as Hubert Derdon, but Martin Bagot sleeps in a separate room). Of course the Bagots also inhabit the same house in Ranelagh; there is the same carpet in the front sitting room (reserved for guests), the same lovely garden with its laburnum tree, roses and plot of grass, the same worn linoleum in the narrow hall, the same quarry tile in the kitchen, down three steps.Brennan's prose is generally clear and straightforward. She is not however without her poetic moments: She started to stand up, when a warm body touched her leg. It was Bennie, the white terrier, who had come out of his sleep on the rug besides the folding doors to hear a match being struck and a fire beginning. He looked up at her. He had small, brown poverty-stricken eyes and limp ears but the line from his black nose to his chin was fine and square...poor Bennie had been on his last legs when she found him on the street one morning on her way from Mass and took him home. She might have been able to walk past him, but some young boys were tormenting him and she knew she would never be able to look herself in the face again if she abandoned him to their cruelty. He had been in the house five years now...""Good Bennie,"" Mrs. Bagot said, and pressed him closer to her side, and he stretched his neck up to her, and the storm of devotion in his eyes could never have found expression in speech. His silence burned with devotion, and so it would as long as he was alive.James Joyce once claimed that if Dublin were destroyed, it could be recreated brick-by-brick from Ulysses; Brennan's scope is more limited, but there's no doubt that a certain house on a particular cul-de-sac in one suburb of that city could be rebuilt with the details blueprinted in The Springs of Affection....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Mar 15, 2010","Mar 26, 2010","Mar 15, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/928827.The_Springs_of_Affection

(This is the second part of a trilogy originally published in 1960, '62 and '64.) Still brow-beaten by her alcoholic father, Kate takes up with another older, married man. He's somewhat sophisticated and worldly and though he finds Kate's small-town naïveté charming at first, her self-doubts and coarseness begin to wear. They wore on me too. I want to like Kate, but can't stand her whinging ways.Baba is no more successful at love, but is far more pragmatic, self-confident and fun. Kate cowers; Baba rolls with the punches. Kate is 'sincere' (a trait highly admired by her late mother); Baba takes one day at a time and rarely looks back.But I'm engaged enough to carry on with the trilogy and see where it leads in the final installment, Girls in Their Married Bliss. Part of the attraction is knowing that these books are somewhat auto-biographical. O'Brien was married to a Czech/Irish author, Ernest Gébler, who is the obvious model for Eugene Gaillard. In a recent interview on RTÉ One television (The Meaning of Life with Gay Byrne, broadcast 21 Feb.), she related the ways she was terrorised as a child by her father and how the success of her first book, The Country Girls, produced such jealousy in Gébler that it lead to their divorce. I can't help but to see a little 'payback' in the depiction of Eugene. (I'm such an old woman when it comes to these romans à clef.)But the now 79-year-old O'Brien apparently worked it out of her system; last year she published a well-received biography of Byron and she currently has a new play—Haunted—in production in Dublin.

JoyPut me in the column of those who count this among the greatest stories in the English language; it's certainly one I come back to time and again. Joyce once said that one of his goals in Ulysses was to provide a blueprint for rebuilding Dublin, brick-by-brick. I would contend he started the process in ""The Dead"". From the old family home in Stoney Batter on the North Side to Ballsbridge (where Mary Jane had ""the organ in Haddington Road"") to the O'Connell Bridge and the statue of the Liberator, Daniel O'Connell (""'Goodnight, Dan,' he said gaily."") and the quays of Usher's Island, the novella could be used as a tour guide of the Inner City, even today. But the scope goes even further afield, back to pre-Christian Ireland and into the future, beyond the grave: to the West, Tir na nÓg, the Hiberno-Celtic Valhalla. For the Dubliner especially but the Irish in general, the concept of ""the West""—the land ""beyond the Pale"", across ""the dark mutionous Shannon""—holds a mythical power of birth, death and re-birth: of eternal life.""The Dead"" may be one of Joyce's most political stories (""Ivy Day in the Committee Room"" is more overt), with the undercurrent of nationalism provided by the character of Molly Ivors, and her jocular indictment of Gabriel as a ""West Briton"". He also touches on sectarian issues, thanks to the character of Mr. Browne, the Protestant, and even proto-feminism, via the discussion of Aunt Julia's expulsion from the choir. There is so much crammed into these few pages, and yet it is not heavy-handed (in my opinion). All these topics flow quite naturally from that pinnacle of Irish art and character: Conversation.In all of the stories in Dubliners the main character reaches a kind of epiphany, and it's no small thing that Gabriel's occurs on the Feast of the Epiphany, Twelfth Night, the holiday the party celebrates. (The clues regarding the date are subtle: we're told that Freddie Mallins ""took the pledge""—to stop drinking—a few days earlier on New Year's Eve.) By the last paragraph—that beautiful, moving, elegiac last paragraph—Gabriel realised ""the time had come for him to set out on his journey westward""....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Dec 17, 2009","Dec 18, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1281162.The_Dead

I had one semester of grad school to go; the draft of my written thesis had been turned in and only the design portion and editing remained. We left Cincinnati and it was below 0° F, for Chicago, with a connection to Newark, with the final leg to San Juan. Naturally, there was a delay in Chicago; we watched with rapt attention CNN on the airport television screens—there were two main stories that day, both about death. Billy Martin, the former baseball player and long-time manager of the New York Yankees—""Old Pork Nose"", as my dad called him—had died the night before. But perhaps more important in reach, was the death of Nicolae Ceauşescu and his wife, Elena, by firing squad, to end the Romanian Revolution.These were heady days. The month before, the Berlin Wall fell. Communist regimes all over Eastern Europe were falling, mostly through atrophy. The ""cold war"" was over for the most part. In two years' time, the Soviet Union itself would crumble, disolving into first a loose federation and later into the world as we know it today. In most of the former ""Eastern Bloc"" countries, the former governments just faded away. Erich Honecker of East Germany died in exile in Chile after a brief imprisonment; Gustáv Husák died in quiet obscurity in Bratislava in 1991 two years after Czechoslovakia's ""Velvet Revolution"". Only in Romania was the leader tried, convicted and executed in rapid succession to bring about end of the regime.But perhaps only in Romania was there a ""cult of personality"" like Ceauşescu's. Though no Stalinist himself, he did emulate Stalin's ruling style. Perhaps it's the ultimate case of ""reaping what one sews"". For me on that Christmas Day twenty-years ago, well, we finally got our connecting flight and landed eventually, after midnight, in Puetro Rico; the temperature was 90° F.Who could have guessed that the little three-year old child with us that day would spend a year in Bucureşti, learning limba română? Or that I would visit her there? But enough of my reminincing. What about Herta Müller's?It took me a dozen or so pages to get into Müller's style, to hear her voice and sync with it. To tap into her ""heart-beast"". (The original German title, Herztier, translates literally in English as ""heart-beast""; in Romanian the title is Animalul inimii. The phrase is used frequently in the book and has a resonance which the ""green plums"" do not carry, in spite of difficulty of translating.) The text itself seems to convey the mood, rather than exposition or dialogue; there is a sense of ennui, of the ""banality of evil"" (to use Hannah Arendt's famous phrase). This is beyond mere stoicism: it is a defense mechanism, the only possible way of dealing with the utter brutality of life. Repetition of certain words and phrases bring a subtle sense of the artisty of Müller's clipped prose. There was a feeling that each word was carefully chosen, crafted.I enjoyed the book, and will read more of her work, not just for the subject matter, but Müller's handling of the material. If anything, her experiences, as a Swabian, Germain-speaking minority in Romania, may be atypical. Müller's Romania was crushingly repressive, but there was always the hope—however remote—of escape to the West, to (in the words of her narrator's father, ""the Motherland""—that is, West Germany). One can only imagine the nightmare of life without even that for the ethnic Romanians.A week ago tonight, Herta Müller was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for 2009 by King Karl XVI Gustaf of Sweden; I attended an event at the Goethe Institut in New York (co-sponsored by the Romanian Cultural Institute/Institutul Cultural Român) celebrating her accomplishment; the main speakers were her American publisher and translator....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Dec 16, 2009","Dec 13, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1165062.The_Land_of_Green_Plums

Perhaps that was because the narrator at the beginning in rather young, and the writing is imbued with something of the impatience of youth. I guess that's a credit to Pamuk's strength as an author. But by midpoint I was hooked and glad I slogged through.There are many typical Pamuk themes here: lost love, the cultural tensions between East and West that have marked Turkey's history since the days of the Ottomans, the search for deeper meaning. The usual subjects, in other words. Many of my favourite writers are old men. William Trevor. José Saramago. Maybe Orhan Pamuk is the youngest of the old men I read, being only a few years older than I am. And many of these favourite scribblers write the same book over and over and over again. Trevor writes the Trevor book. Pamuk writes the Pamuk book. Seeing how they rewrite it, and letting yourself be entertained and charmed and beguiled all over again is part of the enjoyment. Another subject particularly strong in this book was the nature of ""coincidence"" in life. So it was appropriately coicidental that getting off the Staten Island ferry this afternoon after a trip to visit Mom, I walked up Whitehall, past Bowling Green and there at the foot of Broadway behind the Wall Street Bull statue, flying next to the American flag was the Turkish banner.

But for all their introspection, they are no more enlightened about their motives. And the protagonist of this book was no different; Stephen Lewis allows himself to slink into self-pity and despair quite readily.This is one of McEwan's earlier novels, and not nearly as focused as the later things which I've read.

I first read Memories... when it was new, so a re-read is in order. I'm posting the same  for both books, as it is a ""compare and contrast"" sort of thing:I’m ing these books together because they are two interpretations with the same basic plot at their cores: an older man goes to a brothel to sleep with a virgin. But oddly enough, despite the common setting, “sleep” in both books is not a euphemism for sex: the girls in Kawabata’s novella are drugged, their clients are forbidden to violate them, though most would be physically unable to do; Márquez’s unnamed narrator finds a fourteen-year-old virgin asleep from exhaustion and doesn’t have the heart (or level of desire) to wake her.Naturally this gives both men plenty of time to muse on the nature of sex and aging, memory and its vagaries, although with very different aesthetics. House of the Sleeping Beauties has the rigidity and cool complexity of a Zen rock garden; Melancholy Whores is lush and thick as a dripping tropical forest of its unnamed location on the Caribbean coast of South America. Beauties has the harsh sensuality of denial and deprivation—it seems to be always winter—and somewhat in keeping with one’s perception of post-War Japan, before the economic explosion of the ‘60s; Whores exhibits the sensuality of ennui and entropy, the colonial splendour gone seedy, gradually losing the battle against encroaching nature: A metaphor perhaps for its narrator.I enjoyed the Márquez book much more—perhaps because of the innate cultural bias. I first read it when it was new. When I heard about the plot of House of the Sleeping Beauties, I immediately recognised it and was intrigued. And indeed, Memories of My Melancholy Whores begins with a quote from Kawabata’s work which I didn’t appreciate on my first reading.

She's not very likeable, and musings—lyrical though they are—do not seem genuine, do not seem to fit the character or the personal history the author created for her. I did come to like the book more as the 'drama' of events—quiet and personal as they were—unfolded.When I was about a quarter way into it I wrote: I must say the prose is lovely, but seems to me somehow ""disingenuous"". My own mother grew up on a farm of land in rural Ireland in the 1940s-'50s, and while she has the gread ability to turn a phrase, I can't imagine her (or anyone who isn't an author crafting their work) having the kind of mental musing Mr. Barry attributes to Annie Dunne. There also seems a bitterness in this (and from what I've read about his other works in those as well) about the 'displacement' of Anglo- or Protestant Irish after independence. A bitterness that one doesn't see in William Trevor's work (for example), which covers some of the same ground; and Trevor, in his own experience, is much closer to the historical events. It would make for an interesting comparison for some grad thesis or disertation.

Ellie Dillahan is a young farm wife, a foundling placed by the nuns who raised her as housekeeper for a widowed smallholder; a man she marries out of a sense of compassion and gratitude, duty and mutual dependence.""Nothing happend in Rathmoye, its people said, but most of them went on living there. It was the young who left—for Dublin or Cork or Limerick, for England, sometimes for America. A lot came back. That nothing happened was an exaggeration...""What happens to Ellie is that she meets a man; a lonely, quiet man who excites in her the possibilities that life might offer. This is a quiet book, filled with characters who have had their individual heartaches and frustrations but in general expect little and are not disappointed. Mr. Trevor captures the rhythms and pitch of a lost Ireland, obliterated by television and Celtic Tigers and subsidies from Brussels. The story is elegiac, but not sentimental; an elegy for lost loves, for late summers of memory, for lives atuned to the seasonal repetitions of farm and pasture.A marvelous book.An emendation, 31 May 2010. Like most of the other ers, both here and in print, I stated the the novel takes place in the 1950s. However there is in one of the final paragraphs the following line: ""In Hurley Lane Bernadette O'Keefe turned off a romantic drama...the bright little screen, and night-caps, made a party of the room..."" I suppose that ""bright little screen"" could have been the dial of the raidogram (wireless), but it seems more likely to be a television set. If that is the case, that it's a television set, RTÉ (Ireland's national broadcasting system) didn't begin television transmission until 31 December 1961. According to Wikipædia, ""By the end of the 1950s 60% of the population [of Ireland:] could receive BBC 1 and the UK's Channel 3 franchise from spillover from Northern Ireland, Wales and the west of England"". However, as we assume this story is set in Trevor's native Co. Cork (although unstated in the novel), Cork would have been outside that range geographically, that is among the 40% of the island immune from ""spillover"". A small point, perhaps; by 21st-Century measures, Ireland of the 1950s of '60s would not (on a whole) have seemed that much different.

Trevor takes us from Queen Medb's bedroom where pillowtalk inspires the Táin Bó Cúailnge to Flann O'Brien's Dublin of the early 1960s, using his humor and insight to show the landscape behind lit.But there is also ""William Trevor's Ireland"", with its own inner and outer geography. The place is the young republic, rural small towns and large villages; the time is mid-20th Century, from the '40s through the early '60s; the class can vary, but not infrequently there is that minority within a minority: the poor Protestant family. Whether bank clerk or smallholder, draper or timber-dealer, Trevor looks at this small withering substrata of Irish society. Not part of the once-great Anglo-Irish Ascendancy who lorded over the Big Houses and great estates (as well as most political and judicial power prior to the Treaty), and somehow not fully a part of rising idependent nation with its Catholic majority. These are in fact, Trevor's own people: his father was a bank clerk, moved from town-to-town all during Trevor's youth. There is no doubt something in this personal history which so richly informs and moulds his Irish fiction.And so it is with Nights at the Alexandra, where a middle-aged man is recalling his fifteen-year-old self, a boy who was selected to do messages for the exotic new folks in the neighbourhood of just one of those large villages in the hinterlands. It is the ""Emergency"", as neutral-Ireland called World War II; as non-combatants, they were nonetheless victims of the collapse in world trade, without petrol or tobacco or outlets for their agricultural products. An older German gentleman and his young British wife have bought one of the local estates, fleeing both their countries, neither of which would be hospitable to one of the spouses.""The Alexandra"" is a picture house Herr Messinger builds in the town, as a present to his wife. Having befriended them, young Harry is taken on first to man the box-office and later to run the place, much to the consternation of his opinionated and overbearing family. This is a story of first-love, of memory without regret, of a particularly Irish sense of ""it is what it is""—a sense of resignation without any recrimination.

His simple, More than one er has called William Trevor the greatest writer of short fiction in the English-speaking world and I heartily agree. His simple, soft, un-dramatic prose belies a depth of feeling and intensity that few others can match. Trevor's world is confined to the two islands he has called home, the Britain of his choosing and the Ireland of his birth. The twelve stories here are set in country towns and London suburbs, Munster farms and Ulster villages. It is populated with aged widows and child actors, rare book collectors and lorry drivers, jilted women and brides-to-be; for the most part, simple people dealing with simple problems.There is also, however, in some few of the stories, and element of the macabre, again familiar territory for Trevor (most famously noted in his novel Felicia's Journey). In the open story, ""Three People"", it is gradually revealed that someone has died; an alibi is provided by a total stranger of limited mental capacity, who twenty-years later is still visiting the house were the tragedy occurred. In ""Against the Odds"" a jilted spinster exacts her revenge by conning random men into giving her large sums of money. Less sinister but no less creepy is ""Le Visiteur"", where a young wife, horribly humiliated by her boorish older husband uses a handsome bachelor as a tool against her spouse.Trevor also has a unique perspective on the religious differences which have plagued Ireland in general and the North in particular, for most of the last century. Having himself been reared as a Protestant in the Republic, he has a great sympathy for both communities: in ""Of the Cloth"", a young Catholic curate commiserates with an older CofI rector whose parish has been decimated by the rolling years. ""The Virgin's Gift"" describes a medieval monk's progression from family farm to monastery to hermitage and back again. Many of Trevor's characters, so richly and yet simply drawn, are outsiders. Perhaps this too reflects his own experiences growing up in a minority community in his own country.The eponymous final story of the collection is the most heartrending. Simply put, the youngest son of a medium-sized family inherits the farm of an uncaring father, at first merely because he alone of the siblings has no other demands and can take care of their mother in the place she's lived for decades. But finally Paulie—like the monk Michael in the earlier story—chooses to follow a calling, the calling of the land. Like the monk, he is destined for a life of poverty and celibacy, and though he knows the fate that his choice has determined, he accepts it as his choice.When her own death came, he other children would return, again all at the same time. The coffin would be carried down the steep stairs, out into the van in the yard, and the funeral would go through the streets of Drunbeg, and the next day there’d be the Mass. They’d go away then, leaving Paulie in the farmhouse…Guilt was misplaced, goodness hardly came into it. Her widowing and the mood of a capricious time were not of consequence, no more than a flicker in the scheme of things that had always been there. Enduring, unchanging, the hills had waited for him, claiming one of their own....more",Notes are private!,0,1,2,"Jan 14, 2011not set","Jan 18, 2011not set","Jun 21, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/599553.The_Hill_Bachelors

The setting is not unlike Trevor's most recent novel, Love and Summer: small-town rural Ireland in the mid-century. Of the characters too there are certain similarities. Mary Louise is not unlike Ellie Dillahan; the cousin Robert shares similarities with Florian Kilderry, as do their respective husbands also. It is almost as if Trevor wished to re-examine the theme, vis.: a young woman married to an older man finds love with a different man, one of her own age. But the younger men in both are unavailable, though for different reasons. Robert—always frail—dies; Florian, also slight of build and sensitive, is forced into a not unwelcomed exile.And indeed despite the many similarities, there are significant differences: The main characters of ""Reading Turgenev"" are all Protestants—not of the Ascendency however, but that class of smallholders and merchants, branch bank managers and jobbers, who were gradually subsumed by the dominant, majority Roman Catholic culture that surrounded them. Much like William Trevor's own family. In Love and Summer by contrast, the only nod to sectarian differences comes in the person of the old man who used to work at the library of the ""Big House"" for the long-departed landed gentry.More significantly is the way the two young women react....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Mar 15, 2012","Mar 25, 2012","Jun 21, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1052619.Two_Lives

In almost all these pieces, are about couples and their relationships. That being said, not all of the couples are still together: there are divorces, marriages that never occurred, deaths. The blind piano tuner had two wives: the one who died and showed him the world with her descriptions; the other, whom he might have married first but eventually staked her claim on their later years. There are the step-brother and -sister who playact out their custodial parents’ infidelities. Widowed sisters who live together deal with a less-than-scrupulous handy-man. A single woman—”her dark hair short, her long face strikingly like the sharply chiselled faces of Modigliani, a month ago…passed out of her twenties”—settles alone each night for dinner in the Pensione Cesarina.

When the girl becomes pregnant and refuses to “go to England” (i.e., have an abortion), her uncle offers money to the man who buys their small crop of potatoes in exchange for marriage.As is expected from William Trevor, all these stories are lovingly rendered; there is no other way to put it: one gets the impression that the authors loves all his creations, with all their flaws and foibles, crudities and afflictions of mind, body and spirit.

The ending was, in facI wrote this is my journal in October, 2007:I’m sort of happy to report that Todos os Nomes did not end as I expected it might. The ending was, in fact, totally unlike anything that I expected--which is why my happiness is reserved. Although our protagonist Senhor José was apparently forgiven all his indiscretions and went on to live unhappily ever after, I think my imagined ending would have been more fitting. Perhaps I should explain:Senhor José is a 50-year-old, unmarried clerk at the Central Registry, where births, deaths, marriages and divorces are recorded. The Central Registry is Kafkaesque--overwhelmingly rigid and arcane and authoritarian. As a hobby, he clips articles and photographs on the 100 most famous people in the country--pop stars, actors, bishops, politicians, &c., and it occurs to him to add copies of the birth certificates (to which he has access) to his dossiers. One day after hours, he takes a few documents to copy, and by mistake, picks up the card of an unknown woman. He becomes obsessed by this unknown woman: she’s 36-years-old, divorced, and that’s all he knows about her. He forges a letter from his superior and goes off to the building where she was born to see if she still lived there, which of course she doesn’t. But there is an old lady on the ground floor who knew her. In fact this old woman was the girl’s godmother, and he discovers somewhat to his dismay, the reason the girl’s family moved is that the old woman and girl’s father had an affair. He does however get information about the school the girl attended. As his obsession increases, he goes to the school, over a weekend, breaks in and discovers the girl’s school records. But then he seems to come up to a dead end. Indeed, he goes back to the records at work and finds that the girl’s card has been recently updated: she’s dead. Suicide. He visits her grave in the Central Cemetery (almost equally arcane to the Central Registry), then he returns to the old woman on the ground floor to tell her about her goddaughter. The old woman tells him that she’s talked to the girl, told her about the affair between herself and the girl’s father.There are still a few cards he hasn’t played. He finds the girl’s parents’ number in the phone book, and finally, he forges another letter of authorisation and goes to see them. He learns that she was a school teacher, in the same school she attended; the same school he broke into to steal her records. Though her father is annoyed by his probing questions, her mother gives him the keys to her flat. But first he goes to the school and interviews the headmaster, who reports how upsetting the entire thing has been for the school community, especially coming on the heels of a break-in! He goes to her apartment and is finally among her things. He’s looking for a suicide note, something that can explain what happened. How he could have been so close (when he was in the school the first time, he even saw the records of the teachers but never thought there’d be any reason to look at them) and yet missed her. At the apartment, he doesn’t do a thorough search--after rifling through a few drawers and her closet he realises that even if he finds a note or diary or something, whatever knowledge he gains won’t really mean anything. She’s gone, and his life will go on as it had before he became aware of the unknown woman. His last step is to return to the old woman on the ground floor (these are the terms Saramago uses--the only character in the book given a name is our protagonist, the clerk Senhor José), but she‘s been taken away in an ambulance, and for all he‘s able to find out, she may be dead too.Senhor José returns to his home (a hovel attached to the Central Registry like an anchorite’s cell--there‘s even a connecting door, which is how he collected the records after hours). There he finds the Registrar, a magisterial and pompous figure throughout most of the book, but who has learned all about Senhor José’s nocturnal ramblings, and oddly enough understands.And that’s it. That was the big dénouement.What I was afraid might happen, what I believe really did happen, is that the unknown woman, who was always of a sad and sombre mien, learning of her father’s indiscretion with the old woman on the ground floor (who of course was thirty years younger at the time of the affair), was plunged into despair. And then, she somehow found out that it was her records which were stolen from her school; that she was somehow responsible for the break-in, even if her responsibility was only for being the victim. And thus the reason for her suicide, the reason Senhor José never found, was in fact himself. It was his prodding and probing that lead to her suicide. That he in fact killed the very person for whom he was searching.Given Senhor José’s temperament, I think the knowledge would kill him; that is, he would kill himself in remorse. Not that it would help to bring back the unknown woman. Not that he would hold any hope of their being united in some afterlife (he appearing as atheistic as Saramago himself); and he knows from his experiences in the Central Cemetery that there is only a slim chance they would be united physically by having adjoining burial plots. I wonder why our intrepid author, Senhor José Saramago, decided to spare his namesake. Had he become too fond of him? There was something child-like about the character, and we often hear author’s refer to their creations as their children, or at least with the same affection as people generally reserve for their children....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Oct 26, 2007","Jun 21, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2528.All_the_Names
