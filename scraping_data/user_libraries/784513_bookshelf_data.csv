It was quite in depth, but I can understand how the author felt invested in her research and probably hated to pare down. I also loved the premise for why Worsley chose to write this book--she worked at Kensington Palace and passed these portraits of people from the Georgian Court (both royalty and servants) and wanted to know who they were. So she found out! It's the kind of thing I'd love to do myself, and the book she turned out shows both her skill as a researcher and as a writer.I've been surprised since reading this book at how many pieces of knowledge gained from it have come up. It's a great introduction to the time period (one I wasn't super familiar with) in addition to the royalty. Anyway, if you have any interest in the life and times of English royalty, or just like getting a sneak peek into a very different way of life, you'll enjoy this book....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Feb 02, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8107171-the-courtiers

She brought up in the first few pages how she was a good student and loved reading and writing, so of course I’m going to hold you to a higher standard, but no, the writing is not great. You just have to kind of look past it to enjoy the story.I would have given this 4 stars except that the ending felt very suspish. Like, “oh, these darn organized-crime Russians got me mixed up in their indictment when I had NO IDEA anything untoward was going on, but I refused to cooperate with the FBI.” If your game is legal, and you had no knowledge of their criminal behavior, wouldn’t you cooperate fully with the FBI?Also, the whole thing was painfully self-aggrandizing. She is literally good at everything, and any setback lasts for about 2.5 seconds before she comes back stronger than ever through grit and determination. Another contention I have with her riches-to-rags claims at the end is that if she really is sooo smart and learned so much from observing these genius business men for years, why didn’t she stash some money away where it couldn’t be entirely seized by the attorney general? That seems exceptionally naive for someone who knew she was in a legal gray area and had lawyers on speed dial.And speaking of that legal gray area, she makes a HUGE deal about how it was technically legal as long as she didn’t take a “rake” (a cut of the winnings). But it turns out (follow up online research) that she had a drug addiction and was taking a rake of her New York game. *Also* the ponzi-scheme thing from the LA game happened several years ago, and the FBI had been surveilling her ever since. Her arrest was because they had proof she was taking a rake and not because of these Russians she was somehow innocently lumped in with.Sooo, I’d like the book more if she’d been fully honest. Every bad thing that happened was someone else’s fault (or her not listening to her infallible ‘gut,) so that got a little tiresome and (understandably) didn’t ring true, so I ended up not feeling invested in her or rooting for her. IMO, she got what she deserved (about 5 years too late) but the book was still fun and readable....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jan 20, 2022","Jan 20, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18090048-molly-s-game

I had to read so. much. other. stuff. that wasn’t that! Here are the scenarios in which you, as an author, get to indulge your “whatever loosely connected stuff I’m thinking about” impulse to put pen to paper and expect readers to praise you for it:1) You’re a really great writer2) You’re a really humorous writer3) You’re really famous None of these scenarios apply here, so you’ll likely find this book more tedious than rewarding. I did get a few good chuckles out of this book, but at what price?Finally, I’d be remiss if I didn’t point out how supremely annoying it was that the author POINTEDLY avoided name dropping, and then later on would be like, “Oh, I’ll just say it.” Like in so many situations I truly couldn’t care less who or what the actor/town/hotel/airline/famous author were. Either tell me or don’t tell me, whatever. But quit harping on the fact that you’re not telling me! It’s not cute. And if you’re going to make that a thing for several chapters, then don’t give it away later! Otherwise, why was it even a thing? Make up your mind and stick with it! Sheesh.Anyway, the author heavily implied that he has devoted fans of his writing. They’re welcome to him.

But I’m inclined to believe that the majority of “maybes” are him.This book was sad (obviously, since hundreds of innocent people are murdered in their beds) but the authors don’t dwell too much on the gory details.
