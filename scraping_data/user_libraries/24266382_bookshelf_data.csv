Britney is a surviver and should be REVERED for enduring what she endured. Just reading some of her experiences, I felt very hopeless. I can't imagine she actually lived them. She deserves nothing but peace for the rest of her days. I do wish that we got a more profound look at her life when she was at the top of her game, in the 1990's - early 2000's. The ""Oops!...

She seemed to give us only the summary version of that chapter in her life, and skimmed over much of it, choosing to focus instead on her all-consuming relationship with Justin Timberlake at the time. Britney was one of the biggest pop-stars of her generation (if not THE biggest). She changed the game, she was on top of the world. And we didn't really get to see how she felt about a lot of it, or the inspirations behind any of her songs (for example, ""Lucky"" must have come from somewhere).

It highlights the root of the problems we are facing, vs. what we are made to believe is the root of the problems we are facing (i.e., the war in Ukraine, the Covid-19 pandemic, etc.). It focuses on the economic woes of the U.K., but is still applicable to other countries experiencing a cost of living crisis, of which there are, unfortunately, many. Canada is certainly part of this dismal club (the city of Toronto taking the cake), and I found there was a lot to relate to among these pages.A very concise and much-needed analysis of what is happening today.

I can imagine that They Were Sisters must have been quite the controversial book when it was first published in 1943, for being ahead of its time through its portrayal of domestic abuse. It was very poignant in its illustration of how abuse affects everyone in the household and beyond, and it was full of complex characters that I grew to love dearly over time. Though Dorothy Whipple could be a little preachy at times via the characters of Lucy and William, they were easy favourites and clear voices of reason in a book filled with wayward and/or misguided people. Stephen and Judith were also personal favourites, and, on a side note, it was particularly tragic to see how Margaret was impacted and shaped by her father's abusive behaviour. This book had similarities to Anne Brontë's The Tenant of Wildfell Hall and would be a great companion piece to it. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"May 29, 2023","Jun 20, 2023","May 26, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/59129448-they-were-sisters

This series has been my constant companion for almost one full year,*Tosses The Return of the King into the fires of Mount Doom*Mission accomplished. This series has been my constant companion for almost one full year, since I started with a re-read of The Hobbit in April 2023 and then delved into my first ever reading of the main trilogy that follows. I took my time with it! And not because it was dense (okay, sometimes because it was dense) or too much of a challenge (okay, sometimes). But, rather, because I wanted to savour the experience; I wanted to pick the books up only when I knew I could bestow upon them my utmost attention, when I was in the right mood to be filled with wonder, when I began to miss my friends from Middle Earth. And I'm so glad that I did take my time with it, that I didn't rush through any of these books, because I've been left with a reading experience I will treasure forever. There were a lot of parallels in this tale, namely between: Denethor & ThéodenThe movie portrayal of Denethor, while not way off the mark, was oversimplified and lacked the nuance of the book. Denethor comes across more clearly as a victim of despair and paranoia here, having lost his eldest son, lived in the shadows of a failing house next to Mordor, and consulted his Seeing Stone in what he thought was a way of intimidating the enemy (when really, it only opened his weakened mind to manipulation). We also see him waver when Gandalf tries to restore his reason, which makes his subsequent irreversible fall all the more heartbreaking. This is a lot more tragic to behold. Rather than a sense of relief at his death, one feels a sadness for the man he once was and could have continued to be under different circumstances. Especially when compared to Théoden, we see the strength and honour of one king and the wisdom of his decisions and the bravery he inspires in his men; and contrarily we see the fall of a once great man, ruined and hopeless and devoid of the will to fight.Merry & PippinLikewise, the two Lords (King Théoden and Lord Denethor) each had a hobbit servant at their beck-and-call. We see how Merry and Pippin are each treated by their masters, and also how their loyalties lead them to extraordinary feats of bravery. One, to save Lady Éowyn and help her defeat the undefeatable Witch King; and the other, to recognize the loss of sense in the Steward, and defy the strict rules of the Citadel in order to do what is right. Here we see their courage tested, and their little hearts come out indomitable. Faramir & ÉowynBoth lose a father figure, both fight a losing battle and win, both are saved by a hobbit, both end up injured almost beyond hope in the Houses of Healing. (And both, I might add, are so close to the brink of death that they are almost buried/burned alive). Both are revived by Aragorn, and then left at the mercy of the healers, unable to return to the battle that eventually moves to the Black Gates. Both the children of great nations of men: Gondor and Rohan. One longs to fight to prove her strength, and the other longs for the fighting to end so that they may have everlasting peace. Both so full of yearning and goodness!!! I loved them so much. I cannot stress how much I loved them. I loved them separately, I loved them together. I would have followed their story anywhere, even if it ended up being pages upon pages of them living happily in a cottage, knitting socks and carving figurines from wood (but I do not think that would have been their fate).Also, Aragorn positively swept me away. Behold, the moment that he emerges truly as the heir to the throne of Gondor, and the saving grace in the throes of battle:Thus came Aragorn son of Arathorn, Elessar, Isildur's heir, out of the Paths of the Dead, borne upon a wind from the Sea to the kingdom of Gondor; and the mirth of the Rohirrim was a torrent of laughter and a flashing of swords, and the joy and wonder of the City was a music of trumpets and a ringing of bells.Such an arrival would bring courage to anyone in a moment of crisis. You wouldn't believe it, but all my favourite characters ended up being the men and women!!! Not the infallible elves, nor the enlightened wizards, nor the steadfast dwarves, nor the hardy hobbits!! (Though they are all, indeed, just as wonderful). It was the boring humans for me!! Aragorn, Éomer, Faramir, and Éowyn were my favourites from this last installment of the trilogy, and they are, essentially, The Squad of All Time. Their valour was unmatched, their loyalty and strength commendable, their nobility of character undeniable. Thank you J.R.R. Tolkien for making human beings among the strongest and most captivating characters in a high-fantasy saga!!!Another favourite moment is Sam's wrestling with the ring. Upon taking it from Frodo, he falls to imagining how grand a garden he could make Mordor, if he would only accept the unlimited power. He had only to put on the Ring and claim it for his own, and all this could be. And then: In that hour of trial it was the love of his master that helped most to hold him firm; but also deep down in him lived still unconquered his plain hobbit-sense: he knew in the core of his heart that he was not large enough to bear such a burden, even if such visions were not a mere cheat to betray him. The one small garden of a free gardener was all his need and due, not a garden swollen to a realm; his own hands to use, not the hands of others to command.How aptly said, J.R.R. Tolkien! His own hands to use, not the hands of others to command! (Also, it is not lost on me that when presented with corrupted, evil-levels of power and strength, Sam's wildest fantasy is.... to make people plant flowers.)The chapter entitled ""The Battle of the Pelennor Fields"" was like reading a Homeric epic, the writing and the grand scope reminded me so much of the Iliad, right down to our Arthurian, Achilles-figure: Aragorn.And finally, the chapter entitled ""The Houses of Healing"" was just beautiful. It's no small wonder that Aragorn's moment to shine is here, reviving the injured, rather than on the battlefield, where his deeds are heroic but not dwelled upon in as much detail. As the Warden of this place says: ""A great lord is that, and a healer; and it is a thing passing strange to me that the healing hand should also wield the sword.""Everything else I want to say has already been said in my s of the previous books, so I will just leave now with this parting quote which has filled my soul with happiness and is another one of my favourite moments: Then the heart of Éowyn changed, or else at last she understood it. And suddenly her winter passed, and the sun shone on her....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jan 23, 2024","Apr 03, 2024","Mar 01, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/18687705-the-return-of-the-king

So much of it was filler between the first and the last, and yet it was so lovely and enthralling and important.The first half of The Two Towers revolves around the animosity between Rohan and Isengard, setting up Théoden as a major player in the politics of this world. Unfortunately, the one good character I've always disliked from the films was King Théoden; I've always found him weak—not physically, but rather, when it comes to decision-making, to listening to the right counsel, to showing strength and hope to his men in moments of darkness. A lot of the time in the film, Aragorn acts as a foil to him, reminding him to show his strength, advising him what to do, showing confidence and security in leadership. Théoden has always been annoying to me. But in the book, I was pleasantly surprised to find he is so much better!! (Just as Boromir was also improved in the first book). There are still many hints from Tolkien that Théoden is not as strong of a leader as some of the other characters might be, and some of the lines in the film were taken directly from the book—but courage comes more naturally to him here; he does not balk; he shows benevolent, sincere kindness to the hobbits; he is an all-around Good Guy TM, and I like him a lot! He is a good representative of Tolkien's depiction of the race of men in this world, just as Boromir was: fallible, yet commendable and full of a different kind of strength, a strength that gives you faith in men and their purpose in the fight against evil. For instance, the moment that Théoden stood his ground against the wiles of Saruman was so heartening, and it's a shame it wasn't included in the film.(Side note: book-Faramir was also much improved compared to movie-Faramir... New favourite character just dropped.)These characters fighting around Rohan and Isengard have friendship and community, camaraderie, strong leaders in Gandalf and Aragorn, a sense of hope, and reassurance that they will all help and guide each other to the end. They are still in the beautiful lands of Middle Earth, the inhabited regions that come with histories of victorious battles and honour and light in the dark. Almost immediately before we leave them, Merry and Pippin catch up with Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas over some ale, a hearty meal of salted pork, and all the luxuries of a Shire pub.And then, once the book makes its switch to Frodo and Sam trekking towards Mordor, you feel the stark contrast between the two parallel plots. The lens shifts.We go to Frodo and Sam. They are completely alone. They are tired. They are hungry. There is no one to offer them trusted counsel. They have no choice but to place their faith in Gollum, a deceitful creature who acts as a constant reminder of the end that awaits anyone who keeps the Ring for themselves. They have no rest in the barren lands they walk across. With every step, they get closer the very place anyone with sense would run away from. And while they may have a strong sense of purpose, it is a heavy one, and almost impossible to accomplish, and without the likelihood of a safe return. And all the while they feel the presence of the Eye, and carry with them an object so evil as to wrought physical changes in its bearer and slowly corrupt his mind. All I can say is that this contrast is so expertly written as to be completely and utterly breathtaking. The story clearly shows the difference between adventure and desperation. I felt mired down by Frodo's burden as soon as he took centre-stage again. Throughout these pages, you can sense that World War I serves as the real-life backdrop—that Frodo's plight mimics trench warfare and the emotional battle of the disillusioned soldier.Frodo made me cry several times. Observe, at the gates of Mordor:'Master said so. Master says: Bring us to the Gate. So good Sméagol does so. Master said so, wise master.''I did,' said Frodo. His face was grim and set, but resolute. He was filthy, haggard, and pinched with weariness, but he cowered no longer, and his eyes were clear. 'I said so, because I purpose to enter Mordor, and I know no other way... I do not ask anyone to go with me... If there is only one way then I must take it. What comes after must come.'He has gone from a reluctant task-bearer in Book One, to one that is determined, calm, and accepting of his fate, whatever it may be.I just love Frodo and I will fight anyone who complains about him.Sam also made me cry several times. Observe, shortly after Frodo's statement:Sam said nothing. The look on Frodo's face was enough for him; he knew that words of his were useless. And after all, he never had any real hope in the affair from the beginning; but being a cheerful hobbit he had not needed hope, as long as despair could be postponed. Now they were come to the bitter end. But he had stuck to his master all the way; that was what he had chiefly come for, and he would still stick to him. His master would not go to Mordor alone. Sam would go with him.It's peculiar that none of the hobbits are taken seriously by the Enemy, especially when you read passages such as these ones. Their conviction and their courage rival those belonging to much physically stronger beings. And this is one of the recurring themes in Tolkien's books, one that fills me with such warmth and serenity: even the smallest person can make the most significant change. Power does not equate strength. Ironically, power can sometimes be a weakness, as we see in Sauron, so inflated with his sense of superiority that he pays the hobbits no mind, choosing instead to focus on the flashier threats to his plans. Meanwhile, as the grand, dramatic battles rage on under his eye, our beloved hobbits—having no special abilities, having not even the ability to navigate to Mordor on their own—move ever-closer to destroying him, one tiny, patient, weary step at a time.I love Tolkien for this.The Fellowship's time spent in Lórien in the first book is also alluded to several times in The Two Towers, most often by Gimli. And Tolkien was so right to keep revisiting it! It was without a doubt the most beautiful and memorable part of the first book. Sometimes even I think of it wistfully during my day for no apparent reason, as if I too had visited that colony in the woods and been changed by it.The recurring theme of mercy also plays a significant part in this story, hearkening back to Bilbo's merciful sparing of Gollum in the goblin caves of The Hobbit. Take, for example, this passage after the defeat of Isengard's army at Helm's Deep:No Orcs remained alive; their bodies were uncounted. But a great many of the hillmen had given themselves up; and they were afraid, and cried for mercy. The Men of the Mark took their weapons from them, and set them to work. 'Help now to repair the evil in which you have joined,' said Erkenbrand; 'and afterwards you shall take an oath never again to pass the Fords of Isen in arms, nor to march with the enemies of Men; and then you shall go free back to your land. For you have been deluded by Saruman. Many of you have got death as the reward for your trust in him; but had you conquered, little better would your wages have been.'The men of Dunland were amazed; for Saruman had told them that the men of Rohan were cruel and burned their captives alive.We then go on to see Gandalf spare Saruman, and Frodo spare Gollum (in this act, coming as close to a messiah-figure as I have ever seen him). All the characters on the side of goodness are merciful, and this is exactly what separates them from their evil counterparts.(Except for Sam, who often grumbles about throttling Gollum in his sleep. And who can blame him!!)The world of Middle Earth, in the end, is saved by mercy. By small acts of kindness.And yet, I admit, I am feeling a bit of ""Middle Earth fatigue."" But fear not! It is not enough to deter me and I am still enthralled by the beauty of this story. I will end this. The third book is my Mount Doom, and I will reach it by the skin of my teeth if by no other way.==== Edit ====I've made so many updates to this  already, as I keep thinking: ""And another thing! And another!""But just to touch upon an earlier observation again: Faramir is AMAZING in this book. I finally have a major bone to pick with Peter Jackson, for his terrible portrayal of Faramir in the film. Faramir never holds Frodo as a prisoner! He never takes the hobbits off their path and towards Minas Tirith! He never considers taking the Ring to Gondor, or claiming it! HE TUCKS FRODO INTO BED! He never harms Gollum (and makes it clear to him, besides, that Frodo is blameless and is the sole reason that Gollum's life is spared). Faramir's conversation with Frodo is some of the most beautiful writing I've ever read. His character is pure and noble and trustworthy. The reader never really doubts him, not as the viewer watching him on the screen is led to. Book-Faramir is neck-and-neck with Aragorn for being the most good and kind man in Middle Earth. He is certainly one of my favourite characters now.I just love Tolkien for what he so clearly says through each of his characters. None of them are commendable for their physical strength, but for their inner strength. Their kindness and gentleness. Just as I remember Lórien most clearly from Book One, I think my main takeaway from Book Two will be the chapter where Faramir shows his worth as he speaks to Frodo and Sam in the caves. Just so beautiful! So heartwarming! Yet another moment where tears were brought to my eyes.==== A few final things ====- Shelob the Spider is 1000x more horrifying and vile in the book than the movie could ever hope to portray. Made me feel physically ill- Frodo never abandons Sam and tells him to go home (although to be fair, there is still time for this to happen at a different point, maybe in the third book. Will report back)- Sam's love for Frodo is so pure and beautiful, there are some passages that are just downright heartbreaking...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Oct 10, 2023","Jan 18, 2024","Mar 01, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/6428447-the-two-towers

Truly serene. - I never wanted this to end.- Perfect book to read at the end of summer / start of autumn.- Actually wanted to live inside this book. - So full of hope and all things good. - Teared up several times. (view spoiler)[(i.e. When Gandalf told Frodo we can only decide what to do with the time that is given us, whenever anyone defended Frodo or refused to leave him alone, whenever Sam did anything ever, when Glorfindel rescued them, when the Company came upon the grave of Balin, when Gandalf was tired trying to run from the Balrog and eventually died defending everyone from it, when Aragorn felt true peace and serenity in Lothlórien, when Galadriel made peace with Gimli and his people, when Galadriel passed the test, when Galadriel gave them each a parting gift, Boromir crying over his weakness and his attempt to attack and insult Frodo... These are just the moments that come immediately to mind. You can imagine how emotional of a read this was.) (hide spoiler)]- Everything in Lórien was SO well-written, just stunning. My favourite chapters. - Gimli surprisingly emerged as my favourite character (or one of them, at least). He was so much more than comedy relief. - Galadriel another favourite.- Boromir so full of honour, and love for his people.- Aragorn = King Arthur (*heart eyes*)- The hint of Middle Earth's ancient history that was alluded to in songs and conversations was eerie. Gave the feeling of barely scratching the surface. Of history continuing, of being connected to the past.- The scope truly feels so much grander, the stakes so much higher than in The Hobbit. - I don't know how else to describe it except to say that this book is beautiful.- Made me appreciate how faithful Peter Jackson's adaptation is to the book (as if I needed any reason to appreciate Peter Jackson's adaptation).- And there is actually no part of this story that J.K.

It comes hot on the heels of having an out-of-body experience during a work meeting. You play along with something long enough, you get used to it and stop noticing how artificial and performative it can be. Until you notice it again, and then it’s like being hit with a hammer on the head. In is about exactly that feeling, and it’s perfectly executed. (The section where Nick attends a virtual work meeting was hauntingly accurate and laugh-out-loud hilarious. Likewise, the section where Nick congratulates himself on his artistic persona while taking the subway was all-too-relatable.) I think I'll find myself flipping through these pages again every so often, just to remind myself to search for and foster the golden authentic moments in this life. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Mar 04, 2023","Mar 05, 2023","Jan 21, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53968432-in

I""Once I went to the zoo and there was a cage with a frenzied armadillo in it going around in figure-eights, just around and around in the same path. I can still remember the funny metallic sound its feet made on the bottom of the cage. They say all animals get that way when they're caged, it's a form of psychosis, and even if you set the animals free after they go like that, they'll just run around in the same pattern.""Margaret Atwood targets consumerism and consumption in this, the first of her novels, published in 1969. I wish I had read The Edible Woman in my very early twenties, when I was constantly (pretentiously, no doubt) thinking about things like existentialism and freedom. I think this book would have validated a lot of my feelings and it might have become one of my favourites. Having said that, this is another one of those books that non-office workers might find tedious, as nothing really happens other than Marian's listless travelling to and from her desk and her absurd observations in between. Luckily (unluckily?) for me, I am an office worker, so I was riveted. There is also something so special about the experience of taking the subway in Toronto while reading a Margaret Atwood book that takes place in Toronto. Of course, this book was a very meaningful and witty psychological examination, but for me it was, above all, a time-capsule of this city in the late-60's.
