I loved it, then I hated it then I loved it, then hated it again.There’s a lot of vampire and humans having sex, with the biting and the sucking and the licking…All in all I have to say, despite some unique twists and turns that I was ultimately disappointed with this book. The biggest thing I learned from it is not to buy books on a whim. Which I did when I read a one sentence reference to this book in another book and I thought it sounded like something I’d really enjoy. I was wrong. As much as I love vampires and any new and intelligent and entertaining take on them unfortunately this was none of the above.Very vague spoiler coming up…The book ends with a multi chapter vampire court case. So I guess there’s an audience for this book if you are young and enjoy courtroom dramas but I am, again, none of the above. So I’d recommend this book for the type of people who like these things and I’m sure you know who you are. And if you don’t know who you are save your money....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Sep 06, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/60925.Fledgling

Oh well, one ghostly season is as good as another.The story goes back and forth from the oppressive heat and humidity of the Japanese summer to a winter cold enough to freeze a huge lake in a fantasy kingdom. So it’s actually suitable for any time of the year.It’s not the book’s fault that it’s taking me half a year to read it. I just haven’t been in a book reading mood recently. But when I finally finished reading it I was very deeply moved.This is a brave book that takes a complex ghost story and turns into a story within a story.It’s hard to say which I enjoyed more, the Japanese ghost story of a girl’s spirit that comes back in another time to make up for her lost childhood. Or the manga story the she never finished reading in life. That story is a fantasy of a powerful and frightening witch who plans to bring her son’s ghost back to life.There are parallel to the two stories but I found them to be subtle and for me they did not materialize until the ending. That’s when my tears started to flow.There are a few lovely and evocative illustrations that helps add to the books atmosphere. There’s also a wise-ass granny, her smug black cat, and the young boy protagonist who wants to help the ghost girl. It’s the boy’s pissing out the window on a cold winter night, rather than brave the cold and stinky old style Japanese toilet, that starts the story in motion.I can’t think of a better start for a story or a better end for a ....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Jan 24, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54714368-temple-alley-summer
