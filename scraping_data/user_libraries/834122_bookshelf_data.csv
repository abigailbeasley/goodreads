Nevertheless, Nietzsche presents a trenchant critique of belief as a a legitimate way of knowing, of the denial of the goods of this world in favor of imagined immortality in another world, and of the ecclesiastical crusade against science and truth. Yet the Christianity that Nietzsche assails is often a straw man (or, at least, he fails to account for the multivariant expressions of Christianity that would side with him against the corrupt and dishonest religion that he is here attacking), and his arguments are frequently matters more of aesthetics than of logic or philosophy. The Antichrist is a great literary response to certain forms of degenerate and intellectually dishonest Christianity, and Nietzsche’s prose is often delightfully witty and brilliant, but this is not a work of rigorous philosophy and is extremely problematic due especially to its misogyny, anti-Semitism, and fascistic tendencies....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Dec 09, 2023","Dec 09, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/441274.The_Antichrist

PrThis first volume of Remembrance of Things Past was not sufficiently compelling to motivate me to read any further volumes of Proust’s magnum opus. Proust’s prose is often unquestionably beautiful and poetic, but it is also labyrinthine in the worst ways: paragraphs that run for pages describing nothing more interesting than a stroll through the countryside; long sentences with multiple relative clauses, appositive phrases, subordinate clauses, and parenthetical asides such that the very convoluted structure of the the sentence renders the sentence almost unintelligible without re-reading it. And what do we get for the Herculean effort of wading through a morass of viscous language? We get the narrator’s psychological self-analysis of his early childhood and Swann’s tiresome obsession with Odette—hundreds of pages of Swann’s stalkerish ponderings and wonderings about where Odette is and what she is doing and thinking and whether he is present in her thoughts and what he might be able to do to meet with her without her becoming annoyed with him. It’s all so very trivial while being a chore to read. There is no plot here, no story—just fragments and descriptions of the lives of the narrator, his family, and Swann. This is not a novel so much as an exquisitely detailed (though partially fictionalized) journal. It is not an enjoyable read except for rare passages of brilliance, and it is due to these rare passages that I have rated this volume three stars instead of two.This may be one of the masterpieces of world literature, and it indeed often showcases beautiful and stunning writing, but it is not for me....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Mar 21, 2023","Mar 21, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/535915.Swann_s_Way

Liane Moriarty is one of those writers.While I would rate her last novel, Big Little Lies as ever so slightly better than her latest, Truly Madly Guilty, Truly Madly Guilty does not disappoint. As usual, Moriarty is a master of building up tension and teasing out an explosive mystery with one bombshell revelation after another. In Truly Madly Guilty, we get four major revelations (view spoiler)[the revelation of Ruby's near-drowning after her fall into the fountain, the revelation that it was Harry who had alerted Erika to Ruby's falling into the pool, the revelation that Harry had been rushing down the stairs to Vid and Tiffany's to rescue Ruby when he fell to his death, and the revelation that Holly had pushed her sister into the fountain (hide spoiler)], and all of them left me breathless and even, in the last two instances, near tears.Moriarty also delivers fascinating characters, all with their own peculiar flaws and strengths. Even if we didn't have the central mystery of the novel, we would still be highly entertained by watching these characters (primarily the women in this novel--Erika, Clementine, and Tiffany--but the men--Oliver, Sam, and Vid--also have strong roles to play) interact with each other and their families. This is a great cast of well-drawn, realistic, engaging characters.If you like plot-heavy novels, Truly Madly Guilty is for you. If you like character-driven novels, Truly Madly Guilty is for you.

But the story itself falters; the plot simmers but never comes to a boil, and the resolution—though realistic—is disappointing and left me feeling hollow. I wanted more story and less lecturing, more character development and fewer linguistic tangents, more magic and less convoluted explanations of how the magic worked. This novel has great potential, but it does not quite strike the right (satisfying, enjoyable) narrative chord.

Focusing on a family of immigrants from Lithuania, The Jungle shows in graphic, sickening detail how capitalism destroyed the health, the spirit, and the lives of millions.While the novel is a brilliant extended argument for socialism, it is also the heartbreaking and fascinating tale of Jurgis Rudkus and his family. The Jungle is the tragedy of both Jurgis and his family and of the United States. I was appalled and horrified by this novel and reminded of the importance of the socialist cause.

I laughed out loud too many times to count and even shed a few tears.Search is the most delightful, engaging novel that I have read this year (2022). I laughed out loud too many times to count and even shed a few tears. This novel is why I read books. There are not enough superlatives to describe how much I loved it, so all I can say to my fellow readers--but especially to anyone in the ministry or to anyone who has attended a small church or attended seminary--is, ""Read this book as soon as you can!""On the face of it, the story of a small church's search committee's endeavor to find a new minister might not sound terribly interesting, but in the expert hands of Michelle Huneven, who shows herself to be a master storyteller, this tale is utterly captivating. The narrator, Dana, is so well drawn and such a sympathetic character that I found myself completely identifying with her--suffering all her frustrations and angst and reveling in her joys and friendships, and I disliked and rooted against her nemesis, Jennie, while still finding a soft spot in my heart even for Jennie. Dana, Jennie, and all of the other members of the search committee as well as the church's current, retiring minister and all of the minster candidates are fully incarnated in the text. Huneven's ability to portray fully realized characters is an exceedingly rare and wonderful talent. All of these characters moved from the page and into my head as real, living people, and I wanted to chat with them and argue with them about the ministerial selection process and about theology and philosophy and to have cocktails with them and dine with them. Even when I put this book down (for work, sleep, etc.), I could not stop thinking about the characters and wondering how the selection process would turn out, and when I picked the book back up, I was immediately fully re-engaged with the story and back in my happy place.I cannot express how much I loved this book. It reminded me not only of my days in seminary and the wonderful, friendly, and sometimes even heated arguments that I had with my fellow seminarians but also of my time growing up in a small church and all of the gossip and turmoil and love and good fellowship and good food that are an inescapable part of any congregation.I loved Michelle Huneven's earlier novel, Blame, and Search has given me such great enjoyment and intellectual pleasure than I cannot wait to see she does next.Bravo, Ms. Huneven!

As the book went along, I found myself more and more outraged by those who claim that the mass murder at Sandy Hook was a false flag operation and that the families and children involved were actors and frauds who had staged the Sandy Hook shooting in an effort to pass gun control legislation. At the end of the book, I was mainly just sad: sad for the victims and victims' families, sad that so many Americans would believe the nonsense promulgated by those who deny the reality of Sandy Hook, sad that these types of tragedies continue to occur, and sad that this type of misinformation and conspiracy theory nonsense is still all too prevalent in our society.Sandy Hook is a monumentally great work of non-fiction and, of course, calls to mind Dave Cullen's seminal book, Columbine, which is also a deep dive into a school shooting. In Sandy Hook, Elizabeth Williamson shows herself to be a wonderful researcher, a great interviewer, and brilliant writer; she pulls together reams of information to spin out a tale of horror, tragedy, outrage, and, at last, a measure of hope when, in the end, many of the Sandy Hook deniers finally have to face the consequences of their vile behavior when they lose again and again in civil court cases....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Apr 20, 2022","Apr 20, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59951103-sandy-hook

Yes, the novel tries to give it a purpose, but it’s not a very convincing one.The way that It is first defeated in 1958 and later killed in 1985 is through the sheer belief and desire of the members of the Losers Club. It is pure magic. It’s not the best explanation, but it’s not terrible either.This novel is extremely bloated. It feels as if there were no editors to tell Stephen King he needed to make some major cuts. My version of this book comes in at 1153 pages, and it would have still been a great story with 300 fewer pages or maybe even 400 or 500 fewer pages.As in most Stephen King novels, what makes this novel really good is the characters. Even though Richie is very annoying, most readers, I think, become invested in all of the main characters and also despise the villains. Because we readers care so much about the protagonists and hate the antagonists, we find ourselves very much enjoying this macabre tale.It’s interesting that in this novel, Stephen King hints that the members of the Losers Club are ultimately helped by the Other (also referred to as Another), and the Other is fairly clearly God. Thus, in the final analysis, this novel is very dualistic: we have an ultimate source of primitive evil, It, that is finally overcome by a power that transcends this universe and It, and that power is God.While I have outlined many shortcomings in the novel, it is, nonetheless, very entertaining. And, as is usually the case, the book is much better than either of the movie versions....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,Dec 2021,"Dec 01, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35012103-it

As I was reading this novel, I found myself exclaiming aloud on many occasions, “This book is sooooooo good!”Waleran Bigod, William Hamleigh, Alfred Builder: such perfect villains. They are not weak, paper villains. They are powerful, executing brilliantly evil schemes—often with nonchalant brutality. We readers truly fear them—but more so, we loathe them. And, oh, how we rejoice and luxuriate in their downfalls.Tom Builder, Ellen, Prior Philip, Aliena, Jack: our heroes are as good and virtuous as our villains are wicked. Though all of them have their flaws, they are ultimately good, kind, and decent. We love their virtue, their intelligence, and their courage and resolution in the face of the murder of loved ones, of debilitating poverty, of betrayal, and of relentlessly hateful enemies.While my copy of this novel was almost 1,000 pages long, reading this novel never felt like a slog. The pacing and subplots kept me fully engaged from the first page to the last. And because I fell so in love with our heroes, I was constantly worrying about them, lamenting their setbacks, and rejoicing in their triumphs. I could not turn the pages quickly enough.Ken Follett is a genius. I love The Pillars of the Earth. It is easily among the best novels that I have ever read.

It is a straightforward, highly detailed, candid recounting of John Bolton‘s time as President Trump’s national security advisor. This book is not a “hit piece” against Donald Trump or Republicans. In fact, Bolton spends as much, if not more, time critiquing the policies and diplomacy of the Obama Administration than he does critiquing Trump. The vast majority of the book covers the day-to-day work of Bolton as national security advisor. For the first 100 pages or so, I found he book a bit tedious as Bolton describes in detail the intricacies of negotiations with sundry foreign diplomats, officials, and heads of state as well as the internal policy-making apparatus of the Trump Administration. As the book went on, however, I came to find it very informative and even engaging. More than anything else, I came away from this book with a newfound respect for Bolton—someone with whom I, as a pacifist and liberal, have found myself disagreeing with strongly in the past on foreign policy—and his realpolitik approach to foreign affairs. This memoir shows Bolton to be a dedicated public servant and an American patriot who truly has the best interests of his country at heart.For those who are looking for a book that will glaringly indict Trump as a corrupt president, there is little in this book that has not been published in other tell-all books of the last few years. What separates this book from other books on the Trump presidency is that it is written by a staunch conservative Republican who never waivers in his commitment to his conservative principles.Bolton’s prose is blunt and pointed, and he never downplays his opinions, especially in regards to his strong disagreements with the Obama Administration‘s policies and his frustrations with Trump’s fickleness and lack of focus.Bolton never offers an opinion on whether Trump should have been removed from office. He indicates that he is very disturbed by what he observed during his time working in the Trump Administration, with his view most succinctly summarized in this quote: “This showed the asymmetry of Trump’s view of foreign affairs. He couldn’t tell the difference between his personal interests and the country’s interests” (page 348). Having now read this book, I am impressed with John Bolton as a man of great integrity, and, surprisingly, I find myself in many ways much more sympathetic to Bolton’s views and approaches to foreign policy.One final note on Bolton’s style: he has a very dry sense of humor, which made me laugh out loud on numerous occasions. As disturbing as much of this book is, it is also quite funny in many places....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jul 22, 2020","Jul 22, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50690953-the-room-where-it-happened

This confession has meant nothing . . . .” (italics in original). I really can’t disagree with him here.This novel seems to be trying to skewer the Wall Street culture of the mid- to late-1980s—to mock the greed, the materialism, the selfishness that so many identify with that era. But it doesn’t really succeed. Instead of a satirical look at the era, the novel sinks into the depths of absurdism. This might be forgivable if there were more redeeming literary value. And there is some: the novel is, at times, very funny, but for the most part, this novel has little to offer the reader other than vapid dialogue among paper-thin characters. There is really no plot; we just watch our protagonist, Patrick Bateman, dialoguing with himself about fashion (to a painfully boring degree) and the latest music and video technology and conversing with others in an endless string of bars and restaurants and conversing mostly about bars and restaurants.And, finally, what turns this novel from a run-of-the-mill, forgettable but passable read to a work of filth is the horrific pornography. This novel revels in murder, in inhuman violence, and in torture of the most gruesomely disgusting kind. I don’t think I have ever called a novel a work of filth before, but here I definitely think it is appropriate. The murder and torture scenes are extravagantly horrific and serve no purpose other than to shock the reader.And yet for all that, I am still rating this novel as two stars instead of one star. It is still well written with a fascinating look into the mind of a psychopath, and Brett Easton Ellis does have an interesting point to make, but he sabotages himself and the entire novel with the torture pornography.Possibly the best writing in the entire novel were the three chapters that were extended s of Genesis, Whitney Houston, and Huey Lewis and the News. Possibly the most hysterical thing in this novel – aside from Patrick Bateman’s constant reference to needing to return videotapes as an excuse for anything and everything – is Bateman’s assertion that Huey Lewis and the News is the greatest rock band of the 1980s; apart from the vile pornography, it is in this assertion that we truly see the nadir of Bateman’s insanity.In the end, I come back to the quote near the novel’s end that perfectly summarizes how I feel about it: “There has been no reason for me to tell you any of this.

The writing is superb and the characterization is exceptionally well done, especially with the protagonist, Wallace.This would have been a 5-star novel for me except that I felt that the pace was, at times, a bit languid, and I would have liked to have seen more from some of the secondary characters, especially Emma and Brigit....more",Notes are private!,0,0,2,not setnot set,"May 21, 2020not set","May 21, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/46263943-real-life

It is definitely borderline incestuous even though there is no blood relationship.And yet I reveled in the adventure, in the fabulous wealth of the Count, in the near omnipotence that that wealth purchased, and in the turns of fortune that the Count brought about in the lives of his enemies. Dumas, departing from his tendency to portray the count as almost divine, deserves credit for making the Count all too human and showing him so overcome by his desire for vengeance that his actions toward Villefort and his family are decidedly immoral. Yes, Villefort is a key figure in Edmond's imprisonment, but two decades later, he seems to have become a fairly good man and was definitely a loving father to Valentine. The Count's inaction leads to the deaths of too many innocent people in Villefort's family, and that is unforgivable on the part of the Count, and the novel recognizes this as does the Count himself. It is nice to see such a large chink in the Count's armor in a novel in which he otherwise can do no wrong.While this is a very long novel, it is fun and enjoyable from beginning to end despite being somewhat melodramatic.

While the narrative of this novel is rather loosely structured, meandering between the Hamiltons and the Trasks, the characters--particularly Samuel Hamilton, Adam Trask, Cathy/Kate Trask, Caleb Trask, Lee, and Abra--spring to brilliant, ebullient life on the page. As a reader, I cared more about just getting to know these characters and following their development than I did about the plot. That's not to say that the plot is lacking because it isn't; rather, the characters drive the plot and so supersede it. Steinbeck's descriptive powers of the Salinas Valley are a sensory marvel. I could see, feel, smell, and hear the farms and landscapes of the valley right along with the characters.The allegory of Adam Trask and his two sons, Caleb and Aron, to the biblical story of Adam, Cain, and Abel is not subtle at all, but it is still cleverly developed. In fact, East of Eden is less an allegory than an extended retelling of the story of Cain and Abel.

It is not a perfect novel, however: the scenes where Ignatius is not present are, by and large, rather hum-drum, with the comedy definitely two or three notches below the level of that when Ignatius is present. But anytime Ignatius is front and center, the novel soars and reels with ridiculous hilarity.One scene that I cannot get out of my mind is Ignatius trying to capture a stray cat and stow it in the bun warmer of his hot dog cart. And there are so many more madcap escapades involving this giant, bloviating, over-educated, pedantic mama's boy.

He writes bold, bombastic sentences that run away with themselves in long lists and rambling tangents that sometimes require re-reading a few times to comprehend. That was my favorite part of this novel: savoring some of Bellow's magnificent sentences.This novel is the story of the eponymous Augie March. Augie is a good guy, a likable character, stumbling from one job to another and one woman to another, trying to make his way in the world. Throughout the novel, he ruminates on life and existence and fears he isn't living up to his potential, but he presses on, trying to find his dream and live it.The writing and the characterization here are brilliant, but there is not really much plot--just pericopes from Augie's life. While I appreciate Bellow's talent, this novel did not move me at all. And while Augie is a well drawn, fully realized character, he is not a character that I came to care all that much about. There aren't any broad themes in this novel that I found compelling. There is nothing really to sink your teeth into in this novel: it's just a novel about a guy's life.

The primary suspect is her husband, George, and everything in the novel points to George being the murderer. The police can never locate any solid evidence, so George is never charged. Near the end, the novel skips ahead 25 years to 2004. The house where the murder took place could not be sold for this quarter of a century, but it finally does sell to some buyers unaware of its bloody history. The real estate agent who sells the murder house tracks down Franny, who is now in medical school, and she asks Franny if she wants to come clean out the house before the new owners move in, and Franny does.As Franny is exploring the house, she finds a heart-shaped Valentine's chocolate box sitting on a book shelf in plain sight. Curious, she opens the box. It is filled with letters that Catherine had written but never sent--mainly to Catherine's own mother but also to her sister and even to God. In these never sent letters, Catherine writes that her husband is ""psychotic"" and her ""adversary,"" that she plans to leave her husband, and in a letter dated the very day before the murder, that if anything should ever happen to her, "". . . don't assume it was an accident.""Why the police never found this box is never explained. It seems incredible that the police would not have done a thorough search of the house and found these letters. When I got to this part of the novel, I kept thinking that there must be a catch or something that I was missing. Because the novel is also a bit of a ghost story, I thought that maybe, somehow, Catherine's ghost had kept the letters hidden for all these years and only brought them out of some mystical ghost world and back to the material world when Franny arrived. However, the novel does not even imply that this is the case, and Catherine hates George, so it makes no sense that her ghost would have kept the letters hidden from the police.I simply cannot understand how this plot hole made its way into this book because the author is, otherwise, extremely talented, but the ending betrays the rest of the story....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"Jan 28, 2020","Jan 28, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25731953-all-things-cease-to-appear

For so many of us, refugees conjure faceless masses huddled in tent cities and filthy camps. In an age of growing nativism, we must acknowledge that every refugee is a person. When we hear their stories, we give faces to those faceless masses. We come to see that refugees deserve the same chance at life as anyone else, and if they want to take that chance in Europe or the US or Canada, we in the West should welcome them.That is why this book is important. It gives us the stories of refugees. It forces us to confront our privilege and ask why refugees do not deserve the same opportunities that we have. Refugees do not owe us their gratitude; they do not owe us anything; however, if we in the West want to live up to the standards of morality set by our greatest philosophers and religious and ethical teachers, then we must embrace refugees and welcome them in their flight from persecution, torture, poverty, suffering, and death....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Dec 28, 2019","Dec 28, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43835469-the-ungrateful-refugee

A novel about beautiful people and their beautiful people proDo you want to read a novel about New York City elites and their extravagant lifestyles? A novel about beautiful people and their beautiful people problems? Are you curious about all of the wonderful clothes and cars and wines and other luxuries that the wealthy enjoy? Well, then, my friend, this novel is tailor-made for you. Unless you also like a realistic plot and characters who resemble actual human beings in your stories--in which case, maybe give this a pass. I'm sorry. That's probably harsh. We all have our own individual taste. Some people might love this novel for very good reasons. It was not, however, my cup of tea.Several of my friends on Goodreads have given rave s to this novel, so I was hopeful that it would be great. Alas, it was not. I started to put it down at page 50, but my friends’ positive comments inspired me keep going. But by page 135, I couldn’t take it anymore. This novel is so utterly vapid that I wanted to stab myself in the eyes so that I would not have to read any more of its horrid prose or endure any more of its awful, amateurish storytelling.I’ll give a couple of examples, among far too many in only the first third of this novel, of why I so very much disliked An Anonymous Girl--at least those first 135 pages of it. Would it have gotten better had I finished it? Possibly, but I doubt it.At one point in this inane novel, Dr. Shields, ostensibly a highly educated and extremely intelligent university professor and mental health counselor, draws the following conclusion from a highly unethical experiment that she is running:“It is clear that not all men are susceptible to the attention of a beautiful young woman.”She had to run an experiment--one that runs afoul of the most fundamental principles of her field--to learn that not all men can be seduced by beautiful young women. An academic and a mental health professional had not already learned this not only from her studies and work but just from general life experience? Really? Are you kidding me? Another distasteful element in An Anonymous Girl is how it continually references all of the amenities that the rich enjoy in life. The authors revel in giving us details about the extravagant lifestyle of Dr. Shields, who seems able to afford a life of luxury that is not commensurate with her position as a college professor and mental health counselor. Consider the following:“An intimate location, the townhouse we once shared, is selected to eliminate outside distractions, such as an overbearing waiter or a boisterous party of six at the next table. The menu was carefully curated: a bottle of Dom Perignon, the same vintage served at our engagement party; Melpeques oysters; a rack of lamb; creamed spinach; oven-roasted baby potatoes with rosemary. For dessert, a variation of Thomas’s preferred sweet: chocolate torte.Traditionally, the torte is purchased at a patisserie on West Tenth Street. For tonight‘s meal, however, the ingredients have been procured from two separate gourmet markets.”If you’ve ever eaten a chocolate torte or just looked at a recipe, you know that you don’t have to go to two separate gourmet stores to get the ingredients. You can easily find all of the ingredients at any grocery store. If you were a snooty rich person, maybe you would buy them at a gourmet store, but you would certainly not need to go to two different gourmet stores. This type of stupid pandering to our idea of what life for the rich is like is nauseating—though it would be less so if such and similar passages were not found on almost every other page.I could go on with this  or with this book, but there are so many things in life that would be more enjoyable than continuing to read this drivel or to discuss it—like clipping my toenails or mopping my kitchen floor...more",Notes are private!,0,1,0,not set,not set,"Dec 09, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/39863515-an-anonymous-girl

Beyond the first third of this novel, reading it became a chore. I had to force myself to traipse through the latter two thirds. It was not remotely enjoyable. I adored Erin Morgenstern's first novel, The Night Circus, so I know that she is a talented writer who can spin a good yarn. The Starless Sea, however, is not good; it is an excruciatingly disappointing follow up to The Night Circus.The character development in The Starless Sea is minimal to non-existent. Despite being almost 500 pages, the novel fails to give much personality to its protagonist, Zachary, and even less to the supporting cast. We know that Zachary is a somewhat reserved, bookish video game fanatic, but not much beyond that; the novel simply does not take the time to flesh out his character. Because the characters are so flat, I didn't care about any of them. I was not invested in their stories or their fate, both of which, stories and fate, are major themes in the novel.And the love story between Zachary and Dorian did not work at all because we know almost nothing about them and can see no reason for them to fall in love. They basically fall in love at first sight with the novel never showing us why, beyond a physical attraction, they are so strongly attracted to each other. The love story lacks credibility. Again, I found myself not caring at all about this romance between our protagonist and his love interest.As poor as the character development is, the plot is even worse. This novel aspires to metafiction, to being a story about stories. It spins out multiple stories within the larger frame story that all relate back to each other and to the metanarrative, but it is all very convoluted--and not in a good way. Being convoluted is not necessarily a bad thing: some novels intricately weave and entwine multiple stories that inter-connect and loop back together such that we can appreciate the bigger picture because of the fine detail work. With The Starless Sea, though, the multiple storylines create more of a Pollack-like chaos than anything remotely beautiful.This novel is a mess. It is very beautifully written and has a wealth of great ideas, but the execution fails to due justice to the prose. Were it not for the quality of Morgenstern's writing, I would have rated this novel as one star. I was so relieved to finish this novel and be able to move on to something that will, I hope, be good....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Nov 21, 2019","Nov 21, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43575115-the-starless-sea

I found the sections describing Robinson Crusoe's adventures and misadventures engaging and enjoyed the sections describing how he made a life for himself on the island where he was shipwrecked, but overall, the narrative structure seemed rather haphazard, and the novel is replete with racism and Eurocentrism with Crusoe himself, in the early part of the novel, setting up a shipping expedition to bring slaves from Africa to Brazil, and the novel takes it for granted that Christianity is the only true religion. To his credit, Crusoe is at least somewhat self-aware in reflecting how unjust it seems that the ""pagans"" of the Caribbean were not fortunate enough to have received the revelation of the Christian religion as did the Europeans, but he is still very much a man of his time.If Robinson Crusoe weren't among the earliest novels to be published and find widespread success, I don't think it would enjoy the reputation that it does today as it has little literary heft, is not particularly well written, and is more akin to Treasure Island than to a truly great work of literature like, for example, Moby Dick....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Nov 12, 2019","Nov 12, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2932.Robinson_Crusoe

I particularly loved how Chbosky subtly and expertly used Jewish and Christian mythology and eschatology to undergird the imaginary world that he created, and he did so with all due deference and respect to the sacred stories. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Nov 2019,"Nov 01, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43522576-imaginary-friend

The central mystery, the disappearance of the three school girls and one of their teachers, is engrossing, but the novel never gives us answer to what happened to them.The writing is first-rate: the main characters are well developed, and the author slowly and expertly increases the suspense as the story progresses, but the lack of any resolution is a big disappointment. Of course, some might say that the author could not resolve the mystery as the novel is based on a true story: the author notes, after the list of the cast of characters at the beginning, that the story may be fact or fiction, and it is up to the reader to decide which.

The novel is set in the South during the Civil War and Reconstruction, and its main characters are all white; as such, racism and white supremacy permeate the novel and inform much of what the characters think, say, and do. Of course, if the white Southerners were portrayed as anything other than racist (unless they were that rarest of rare birds: Southern abolitionists), the novel would not be true to those characters. Thus, a novel with the characters and setting of Gone with the Wind must, if it is to be credible, depict the unapologetic and even celebrated racism that was prevalent at the time. The problem with the racism in the novel, then, is not its honest portrayal of racism but rather the fundamental dishonesty of Margaret Mitchell in not portraying or even acknowledging the true horrors of slavery. Mitchell makes a few oblique references to slaves being whipped, to slave families being separated, to fugitive slaves being chased by hounds, and to slaves being sold to plantations in the Deep South where conditions are hinted at as being terrible, especially as compared to Tara, but apart from these few brief and dismissive references, Mitchell paints slavery as a largely benign institution and one that actually is good for slaves. This is the moral failing of the entire novel and of Margaret Mitchell: Gone with the Wind lies about slavery. Since slavery was fundamental to the Southern economy and to the white Southern culture and way of life as Mitchell clearly acknowledges, Mitchell's failure to be honest in her depiction of slavery is a sin against history and betrays the historical and cultural setting of her novel. Moreover, the novel depicts the Ku Klux Klan as a heroic organization which takes action only to right the wrongs committed by ""uppity,"" ""trashy,"" and criminal, in the eyes of the Klan, former slaves and not as the terrorist organization, murdering and lynching and burning property, that it was. Fictional novels, of course, don't have to be non-fictional accounts, but they must still be true to their setting and to their characters. And Gone with the Wind is not honest; it is a lie.Setting this important failure aside for a moment, we can look at its strengths: Mitchell has created two of the most powerful, memorable characters in all of literature in Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler. Both are amoral, Machiavellian, and thoroughly yet blithely selfish. Still, somehow, Mitchell makes us care for these two horrible human beings. We never quite come to like them, but we do find ourselves concerned for them and their futures, and Mitchell's ability to create such vivid and villainous characters without causing us to hate them shows her genius. It is also remarkable that we are able to maintain our interest in the stories of the lives of these two for over 1,000 pages; they never bore us: we simply cannot get enough of their sordid lives.To Mitchell's credit, she remains true to her characters throughout: there are no happy endings here. In the end, Gone with the Wind is bleak, even nihilistic. The wicked prosper, but even in their prospering, they are not happy. Reading this novel is not enjoyable, and the ending is not sad but dismal and cold. But this novel is not a tragedy: these aren't good people who go astray or fall from grace; they are amoral and oftentimes evil people, and they live in a world where what is sown is not reaped. Their evil goes largely unpunished, though they do suffer tragic losses with the deaths of Bonnie and Melanie. In this regard, the novel is, for once, honest.As I reflected on how to rate Gone with the Wind, I wanted to be honest about its literary merits and did not want my disgust at the lies it tells about slavery to affect my aesthetic judgment. But then I thought: the fact that this novel is fundamentally dishonest about slavery cannot be separated from its literary merits. If someone were to write a story about lower- and mid-level Nazi officials and their families and try to paint a rosy picture of the Holocaust, we would, even if the novel were brilliantly written, not be able to overlook the insult to the millions murdered in the Holocaust nor set aside such a grand distortion of history. Similarly with Gone with the Wind, we cannot give Mitchell a pass in her lying about slavery. She has written a novel that glosses over and even defends one of the greatest atrocities in human history. Were it not for this colossal failure, I would have rated this novel at four-stars based on the strong characters and the story-telling, but I cannot get past the enormous and atrociously evil lie that this novel tells. The moral failing of this novel cannot help but bleed into my aesthetic assessment: any work of art that is dismissive of slavery, the Holocaust, genocide, the rape and murder of children, and other such atrocities cannot be anything other than an artistic failure. And so despite having two of the most compelling characters in the history of literature, Gone with the Wind is a vilely deceitful, despicable, terrible novel....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jul 16, 2019","Jul 16, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/819699.Gone_with_the_Wind

The plot is sparse: while there is an overall narrative--we follow the narrator, Faye, as she flies from her home in England to Athens, where she teaches a writing course to the local Greeks--the novel functions more as a series of short (sometimes very short) stories about Faye's friends, her students, and the people that she meets. These individuals tend to lead fairly typical lives, but Cusk manages to make the typical quite fascinating.I also liked that, at about 250 pages, I was able to breeze through Outline very quickly. It's a serious novel but not one that is overly dense.

This book is an ear-shattering alarm.The apocalypse that I heard about growing up in a fundamentalist religious household is coming. But it’s not the apocalypse of which my fellow believers and I were warned. And unless God or Jesus or benevolent aliens intervene, we will all drink the wine of the grapes of wrath of climate change. If you care about the future not only of your own old age but the future of your children and your children’s children, you must read this book. We need to pull our heads out of the sand and face the harsh and painful reality: climate change is real, and it is changing our world much for the worse. And that horrifying change is coming unbelievably quickly.By the year 2050, the world as we know it will likely be radically reshaped due to the effects of climate change. Many of the world’s coastal cities will be underwater. Hundreds of millions and perhaps even billions of people will be displaced due to the oceans encroaching into our coastal cities, creating migration crises that make crises like the ones we are currently seeing at the US-Mexico border seem trifling.The heat will have devastating effects on agriculture: crop yields will likely plunge, leading to mass starvations. Water will become the new oil in a world plagued by drought. Not only will we humans not have enough water to meet our needs for drinking water and for sanitation, but we will not have enough water for agriculture, further exacerbating the starvation crisis.These changes to our water supply and agricultural systems as well as the destruction of our coastal cities will have profound repercussions politically and economically. We will likely see economic downturns that make the Great Depression look like a minor economic setback. With agriculture and infrastructure and economies in shambles, existing political power structures will fall. The world will be ripe for the rise of authoritarianism and violent revolutions. Contemporary capitalism and neo-liberalism will be dead.All of this could happen very easily by 2050. We could possibly avoid our collective doom if we make radical changes immediately, but the changes would require huge sacrifices here and now, changes that we do not seem to have the political will to make. If we do not change, the consequences for our lives and the lives of the next generations will unquestionably be deadly.Our selfishness and shortsightedness, alas, will likely keep us from changing.

The Razor's Edge is an almost haphazard biography of Larry Darrell told through several pericopes, each separated by a number of months or years. The narrator, who identifies himself as W. Somerset Maugham, paints Larry's portrait largely through his interactions with his friends--many of whose stories slightly usurp Larry's--and all of whom are also in the narrator's circle, with the narrator himself being a friend of Larry. We follow Larry's life over the course of about 20 years, and it is something of a spiritual and philosophical journey as Larry seeks to answer the ultimate questions of existence.My favorite section of the novel is a long conversation towards the end in which Larry and the narrator discuss Larry's struggle with the problem of evil and how, during his travels in India, he found, to some extent, an answer in Hinduism. Larry's discourse is wise, well informed, honest, frank, and tender. It's a passage that, I think, probably inspired a lot of young people in the 1950s and 1960s (the novel was first published in 1943) to look to Eastern religions when they found themselves dissatisfied with the Western religious and philosophical tradition.Maugham writes with a light touch about deeply important matters without being preachy or zealous.

A story of family secrets--dark secrets that destroy lives but also, when exposed to the light, bring a measure of redemption. A story of misogyny and domestic violence and of women and girls fighting to overcome the soul-destroying, spirit-crushing power of patriarchy. A story of courage and cowardice, of despair and hope. A story of women submitting to and being complicit in the worst excesses of sexism. And a story of women standing up to and defying the patriarchal power structure.This novel left me in tears on many occasions. Left me gasping in horror and shock. Left me crying out to God for justice. Left me rejoicing when the women and girls prevailed. Left me reeling with grief at what they suffered. This is a story of three generations of Palestinian American women: Fareeda, the matriarch of her family; Isra, Fareeda's daughter-in-law; Sarah, Fareeda's daughter; and Deya, Isra's daughter and Fareeda's granddaughter and Sarah's niece. The men in the family also have prominent roles, but the women dominate the storyline, and all of the characters are richly drawn and exceedingly complex. These are not typical fictional characters who flit through the readers' mind, only to be forgotten when the book is finished. These women will stay with me and stay with me and stay with me and stay with me. This is an unforgettable story with characters who take on a life beyond the pages of this novel, who incarnate themselves in the minds of the readers; they are the word become flesh.If you could read only one book in 2019, it should be A Woman Is No Man. This is a thematically rich novel with a complex, beautifully composed narrative supported by, as I think I might have already mentioned, truly remarkable characters. This book carried lifted me to the heights of the heavens--and then dropped me. It battered me, shattered me, bruised me, and broke me. And then it tended my wounds, restored my hope, healed me. While I was aghast at and in despair over many of the things I witnessed in the book, I absolutely adored this book. I can't remember a novel having such an impact on me since Hanya Yanagihara's A Little Life, which I loved, and I love A Woman Is No Man as much as Yanagihara's brilliant novel.Bravo, Etaf Rum!

On re-reading it, however, I find myself less impressed. Now, this is not to say it is a bad novel; it is not. There are flashes of genius throughout, especially in the passages on moral philosophy, from which Nietzsche drew great inspiration for his concept of the Übermensch. The interactions between Raskolnikov and police detective Porfiry Petrovich show Dostoevsky at his best with brilliant, engaging dialogue and a fascinating dissection of the human psyche. There is much to like in this novel.The primary reason that I liked Crime and Punishment less on this second read is that Raskolnikov is such a horrible, unlikable character. It's not just that he murders the miserly pawnbroker and her innocent sister, though this issue looms larger for me this time around, but it's also that Raskolnikov is a petty, jealous, sniveling, self-centered, lazy, high-strung, contemptuous person. Even had he not murdered the two women, there would be little to like about him. It's no wonder that, apart from Razumihin, he has no real friends, and he is constantly in danger of alienating even Razumihin. He continually antagonizes everyone in his life--from Sonia, his mother, his sister, and Razumihin, on the friendly side, to the police and Svidrigailov and his doctor and his sister's would-be suitor, on the more unfriendly side. When other characters try to help him, he is, as a matter of course, dismissive and ungrateful. And worst of all, he's weak, lacking all convictions and constantly blown about by whims. After the murders, he lacks sufficient constitution to follow his own convictions about why he committed the crime and how he should respond to his actions. Raskolnikov doesn't possess the strength of character to carry this novel.Additionally, the novel has so many side-plots that, while they do contribute to the overall narrative, take up far too much time. It seems fairly obvious that Dostoevsky had no editor, and he desperately could have used one. My copy of this novel is 629 pages, and I would estimate that a good editor could have cut the novel by about a third, down to 400 pages, give or take 30 pages, without losing any of the novel's philosophical or narrative force.Crime and Punishment is a a good novel, but it is not great. I'm almost afraid to go back and re-read my other favorites of Dostoevsky, The Brothers Karamazov and The Possessed, as I would hate to find that they, too, don't hold up. Prior to re-reading Crime and Punishment, I would have placed it in my top ten favorite novels of all time. Now, I don't think I'd even place it in my top one hundred. But, again, it's not a bad novel: it certainly has had a tremendous influence on many great thinkers, Nietzsche especially, and writers, proffering some profound insights into psychology and moral philosophy, but from a literary perspective, it is too problematic, too unpolished to be counted among the world's greatest novels....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Apr 16, 2019","Apr 16, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/535019.Crime_and_Punishment

It is a character study of all the people connected to the hit-and-run: the victim himself, the victim's family, the local community where the hit-and-run occurred, the perpetrator and the perpetrator's family, and the police detective who investigates; each of these individuals has a fascinating story in her or his own right--enough of story, in fact, that I would read an entire novel just centered on any one of these characters.The novel also tackles the issues of race and religious minorities in rural America. It is not overtly preachy but instead addresses these issues through the lives of the characters. It doesn't tell us about what bigotry is like but rather shows it to us firsthand through the characters' experiences.The central mystery itself is handled with care: there are a few red herrings here and there, enough to keep the reader a bit off balance, and then just when you think everything is settled and the novel is winding down to a quiet, anticlimactic ending, the novel delivers a surprise, but it's not a crazy twist and makes complete sense, so it's a surprise that provides the perfect mix of unexpectedness and narrative satisfaction.The Other Americans is a subtle, quiet mystery with a great cast of characters, and it is exceptionally well written....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Apr 10, 2019","Apr 10, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40988961-the-other-americans

Happily for my endeavor, the book does not reveal the final verdict until near the end. Cara Robertson fully situates us in the time (1892) and place (Fall River, Massachusetts), providing us with a good grasp of the cultural and social environment in which Lizzie Borden lived. Robertson walks us through all that we know about the murders--the timeline on the day of the murders, how the murders were carried out, the reactions and statements of Lizzie as well as of the first people on the scene of the crime, the police investigation, the arrest of Lizzie, the pre-trial hearings, and finally the trial itself, detailing meticulously the evidence presented by both the state and the defense as well as the brilliant rhetorical arguments made by the attorneys on both sides.Thus, by the time Robertson has presented all of the evidence and walked us step-by-step through the trial (all aspects of which are highly engaging reading), I felt like I had a solid grasp of all of the factors in question such that I could render my verdict. Thus, I asked myself, ""Can I say, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Lizzie Borden murdered her father and her step-mother?"" Based on all of the evidence (and Robertson gives us every last piece of information presented at the trial and even more), I have to say that I think Lizzie probably did murder her father and step-mother; if pressed, I'd put the probability of her guilt at 80%. Of course, that means that there is a 20% likelihood that she did not murder her father and step-mother, and that's still a pretty significant possibility that Lizzie was not guilty. Thus, for me, there is certainly a reasonable doubt that Lizzie was guilty, and so my vote, as a juror, would have been not guilty, which is exactly the verdict rendered by the 12 white men who heard Lizzie Borden's case.It seems macabre to say this, but I thoroughly enjoyed this examination of one of the most famous--if not the most famous--axe murders in history. I learned a lot both about the case itself and about the time and place during which the murders took place. It was also (and, of course, I know this sounds terrible on many levels) a lot of fun to set myself up as a juror and to render my verdict....more",Notes are private!,0,0,2,not setnot set,"Apr 07, 2019not set","Apr 07, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40538605-the-trial-of-lizzie-borden

Now, just because this novel moved me to tears does not necessarily mean it is a good novel, but it actually is a good novel--even a great novel. I loved and adored it.The Care and Feeding of Ravenously Hungry Girls is a family drama focusing on three sisters, one of whom has just gone to jail for financial crimes. The chapters move between first-person narration from the sisters interspersed with letters from the eldest sister's husband to his wife. We see not only how the eldest sister's crime has affected her younger sisters but also her daughters and the wider community, and we learn about other tensions and conflicts within this family that have been bubbling under, and occasionally boiling over, for years and even decades.And this story is told with one of the most amazing authorial voices I have encountered in quite some time: Anissa Gray's prose has that rarest of rare qualities wherein you don't feel like you're reading a book but rather that you are completely enveloped in the story. The dialogue never feels forced or manufactured. These three sisters are not fictional characters: they are real, living, breathing, human beings. Everything about Gray's prose is authentic and tangible, graspable, relatable.The Care and Feeding of Ravenously Hungry Girls deals with some difficult themes (child abuse, child neglect, eating disorders, infidelity, homophobia, poverty, crime) but does so without sensationalizing these issues and without vilifying anyone while still showing how harmful these things can be. The novel is also a story of forgiveness and redemption that draws heavily on religion but does so without being preachy and without caricaturing religion or religious people.I loved the experience of reading The Care and Feeding of Ravenously Hungry Girls. I loved the people I met in this novel. I loved the story that it told. I loved the beautiful writing.

She is thrown into the strangest of situations (being transported back and forth in time by unknown forces), yet she responds calmly and rationally, taking steps to prepare herself for the antebellum world to which she continually jumps from her own time in 1976. She is not overwhelmed by panic. She is smart and pragmatic, and her sharp social skills enable her to navigate relatively safely a minefield of dangerous personalities. On top of everything else, she is kind, forgiving, and selfless. She's a great heroine whom we readers are rooting for from the very beginning.Rufus, the villain of the novel, is the best kind of villain: we are ambivalent towards him, unsure whether he is, at heart, good or evil. We meet him as a young boy, and we see that he has the potential to grow up to be a virtuous man, and in another era, he very well could have, but his father--who is distant but still, in his own way, loving--is cruel and beset with the worst prejudices of his time while his mother loves him deeply but is herself a jealous, ill-tempered woman. With such parents, we can sympathize with Rufus and understand why he does not become the man we hope that he would. Rufus is sometimes a very good man, sometimes wicked, earning our admiration one moment and our disgust and anger the next. Like Dana, we want to love him and want to see him embrace what he knows to be good and right, but we can never trust him and always fear him.The supporting characters are not mere props for Dana and Rufus but are well developed with intriguing narrative arcs of their own: Kevin, who endures his wife's strange tribulations and does all he can to help her; Alice, who is born free and suffers in her own unique way at the hands of Rufus; Sarah, the elder stateswoman and cook on the plantation; Carrie, Sarah's mute yet resourceful daughter; Nigel, Carrie's husband and Rufus's childhood friend who must often play peacemaker. All of these characters endear themselves to us and play vital roles in the narrative.Finally, Kindred is a time travel novel, making it a fascinating mix of historical fiction and science fiction. And one of things I most appreciate about the time travel element is that (view spoiler)[it is never explained. Octavia Butler presents the time travel as a given and makes no attempt to give it any scientific or even magical explanation. At first, we readers are, of course, curious about the how and why of the time travel, but that is really only a minor detail when compared to the main story, the relationship between Dana and Rufus; as such, Butler wastes no time trying explain the time travel, and the novel is all the better for it. This is the world she has created. We accept it and move on, allowing the story unfold on its own terms (hide spoiler)]. But what I appreciate even more is that this is a tale well told that kept me in suspense from beginning to end, eagerly consuming the pages as quickly as I could....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Mar 12, 2019","Mar 12, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6393384-kindred

He asks the philosophical and ethical questions surrounding it. He looks at it psychologically, from the mental health perspective. He examines the sociological and religious factors that impinge on suicide. He considers the practicalities of suicide--how access to tools that make suicide easier (guns, for example) affects suicide rates. He wrestles with the difficult questions about suicidal contagion--that is, whether some individuals are more likely to attempt suicide after exposure to suicide in literature, in film, or in the news. Then, moving beyond these academic analyses, Bering probes numerous individual stories of those who have attempted suicide or died by suicide. He quotes extensively from and reflects upon their journals and suicide notes, and he listens to and relates to his readers what their family members and friends have to say. To shed further light, he interviews mental health professionals who have worked with suicidal individuals and academics who have written and published extensively on suicide. Finally, he writes about his own struggles with suicidal ideation; this is a very personal book for Bering, and it's all the better for it.The final result is a fascinating, extremely informative, nuanced discussion of suicide. It is humane, thoughtful, wise, and kind. It offers no easy answers or definitive judgements, for there are none.

MaiMaid is Stephanie Land's candid memoir about her life as a single mother and domestic abuse survivor trying to claw her way out of abject poverty. Maid relates Stephanie's continual struggle teetering on the brink of homelessness: any unexpected expense (medical bills for her sick child, a repair bill for her car, a snowstorm that prevents her from working, etc.) could mean that she couldn't pay rent, and she and her daughter would have nowhere to live. Her family support system is minimal, and she daily endures the stress of trying to scrape together enough money to keep a roof over her head and feed her daughter all while doing one of the most difficult and, at times, disgusting, of jobs: working as a maid.Stephanie's memoir, although entitled Maid, isn't primarily about what she did in this job--though that is an important component of this book. Maid, instead, is more a story of survival. It's a story that shows that, even if you work as hard as you can, you still can't always escape poverty. Maid is also a story about how society treats the poor: all too often, when we are not too busy ignoring the poor, we look down on them, hold them in contempt, and even ridicule them. We shame the poor because we don't understand why they are poor and why they can't escape poverty. This memoir remedies our ignorance and call us to account for our prejudice.Maid is an important book because it shows that society's tendency to blame the poor for their poverty is unjust. Many people who live in poverty, like Stephanie, work extremely hard, doing everything that they can to escape the soul-crushing grind of poverty.

Instead, VFC is a thoughtful, deeply sensitive, achingly lonely individual. We readers are appalled by the injustices that VFC suffers and the horrible treatment that he receives from humans. He does so much good--saving the life of a drowning child, helping Felix and Agatha and their father, quietly listening and reading to learn human language and to educate himself, trying to hide himself as he knows his appearance is frightful--and in the end his reward is being feared, hated, and hunted. So we understand his rage at Victor for abandoning his responsibility.VFC is not the villain of this novel. The villain is the sniveling, wavering, cowardly Victor. As Victor himself frequently laments, he is ultimately responsible for the deaths of William (Victor's younger brother), Justine (wrongfully accused and executed for William's murder), Clerval (Victor's best friend), Elizabeth (Victor's cousin and then wife), and even of Victor's father, who seems to die of heartbreak when Elizabeth, his beloved niece dies. Victor's narration of his story to Robert Walton aboard Walton's ship is a mix: Victor both rages against VFC and describes him constantly as a daemon, a vile and evil mistake while also lamenting his own error in creating VFC. But what Victor never does is admit his error in abandoning VFC: VFC was not created evil; the early scenes indicate that VFC is inherently good-natured but is corrupted by his experiences. Had Victor not shirked his responsibility and slowly introduced VFC into society, the novel would not have ended so tragically, with almost all of Victor's loved ones dead (except his other brother Ernest, whom Victor also seems to abandon when he pursues VFC into the Arctic, and this is particularly galling since Ernest is an orphan and further shows how weak-willed and self-centered Victor is) and with Victor himself dying and VFC presumably committing suicide.With the constant reference's to Milton's Paradise Lost, there is little question in my mind that Mary Shelley was consciously allegorizing the primal Jewish and Christian myth but re-shaping it: Victor is God, and his initial creation, VFC, is Adam, but in Shelley's narrative, there is no original sin--no temptation by an evil serpent due to Eve's (woman's) weakness and subsequent fall. The original sin is God's turning his back on his creation. The fall is God's fault, not Adam's and certainly not Eve's. Yes, humanity bears responsibility for many of its evils, but the ultimate source of the suffering and evil of the world is God. I'm not sure if Shelley herself was an atheist, but granted that she was married to a famous atheist, Percy Shelley, she was certainly not unsympathetic to atheism, and this comes through loud and clear in the novel. Frankenstein reads for me as pre-figuring the death of a weak, tired, and flawed God; Shelley, at least in my reading, pre-figures Nietzsche in writing of the death of God and offering a caustic critique of God's own moral failings.While I loved the themes of this novel and was moved by the plight of VFC, it is not a perfect novel. It seemed a bit over-stuffed at times, especially in describing Victor's early education and later travels throughout Europe and the British Isles. These sections caused the novel to drag a bit, but still, overall, I very much liked this novel and am glad to have finally read it. I really like that this is a novel with only one villain, Victor, and no hero other than an almost hero, VFC, who could have been great but, because of his undeniable sins, is a tragic figure. Therein lies the genius of Mary Shelley: she makes a child-murderer and a revenge killer who takes the lives of his nemesis's friends and family members a sympathetic, nearly heroic character.Final aside: why didn't Victor just make a wife for VFC? Come on, Victor! Why did you do all that work, and then abandon it? Also, why was making a female VFC so much harder than making VFC? You had already made VFC, so you knew how to create new life, yet to make a female VFC, you had to do intensive studies and travel to England for further research. I think it is obvious that Mary Shelley had a nice laugh at the patriarchy with this aspect of the story: woman's superiority makes it much, much more difficult to create a female than a male. I like this subtle yet actually not so subtle dig at the sexism that Mary Shelley had to endure in her time....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Feb 10, 2019","Feb 10, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15861570-the-annotated-frankenstein

The novel offers insights into the history of Hasidic Judaism and the tensions between Hasidic Judaism and Orthodox Judaism. It gives the reader a window into how American Jews processed the tragedy of the Holocaust when the genocide first became widely known at the end of World War II, and it follows, through Reuven's father, post-war Zionist activism in the United States.A primary theme in The Chosen is the ability to see clearly. There are several concrete physical instantiations of this theme: early on, Reuven suffers an injury to his eye when he is hit by a softball, and it unclear whether his eye will heal and regain its sight. While in the hospital, Reuven meets a blind boy, Billy, who is hopeful of regaining his sight through an operation, and Danny, later in the novel, has to get eyeglasses to correct his impaired vision. But the more important aspect of this theme is the ability to see others clearly. Reuven has to learn to see how Danny has been shaped by his Hasidic upbringing and how much of Danny's identity is tied up in Hasidism. Reuven also has to overcome his inability to see what kind of man and father Reb Saunders, Danny's father, is because, for much of the novel, Reuven questions Reb Saunders's love for Danny and his strange way of parenting and interacting with Danny. Reb Saunders has to learn to see the world from Danny's perspective while Danny has to try to see a world beyond Hasidism. Serving as a lens to help all of them see and learn is Reuven's father.To those of us not who are outsiders to Judaism, the novel brings home the immense importance of sacred writings in Judaism. As someone who was raised in an evangelical Christian tradition, I have first-hand experience of how important study of the Bible is, but the evangelical love for and study of the Bible is nothing compared to Orthodox and Hasidic Jewish approaches to and reverence for the Torah and the Talmud: they memorize huge sections of their sacred writings; they study for literally hours a day; they write volumes and argue endlessly over interpretations of tiny portions of text. The Orthodox and Hasidic Jews portrayed in this novel are truly a people of the book, and they make Christian evangelicals and fundamentalists look like dilettantes when it comes to studying scripture.The final chapter of the novel is a revelation for both Danny and Reuven as well as Reb Saunders. All barriers are removed, and they all come to see one another clearly. Most readers, as did I, will shed some tears. The characters in this novel, because they come from a different religious tradition than do I, are in some ways quite alien to me, yet I found more similarities among us due to our mutual devotion to faith, family, and friendship. This is an exceptional novel because, among other reasons, it so beautifully universalizes the human experience....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jan 31, 2019","Jan 31, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/607274.The_Chosen

There is little to no character development: Philip, the antagonist, This story is aimed at high school or junior high school audience, and it shows. There is little to no character development: Philip, the antagonist, is identifiable only by his love of track and hatred of his ninth-grade English class; Philip's parents only distinguishing characteristic is their steadfast support for their son; the defining characteristic of Miss Narwin, the protagonist, is her profession as a teacher; the school administrators are little more than plot devices; Philip's fellow students are distinguishable only in terms of their sex and their names. There is no depth to any of these characters.The lack of character development, though it is certainly a weakness, is perhaps a bit understandable in this rather short and largely plot-driven novel. The plot is interesting enough to carry the reader forward effortlessly, but there is one rather gaping flaw: a key aspect of the story is a newspaper article that is full of half-truths based solely on Philip's rendition of his conflict with Miss Narwin. The school superintendent, after investigating this matter, writes up a clear, concise memo that addresses all the problems with Philip's version of the story and that completely exonerates Miss Narwin. If this memo had been sent to the reporter who wrote the original newspaper article or to any of the other reporters who follow up on the story, the negative publicity that school received from the initial article could have been immediately countered, but this is never done. The school superintendent, after drawing up this memo, decides, inexplicably, to try to make a scapegoat of Miss Narwin. Miss Narwin herself is strangely reluctant to defend herself: had she told any of the reporters who contacted the exact details of the story, the firestorm of bad publicity could have been ended promptly.Nothing But the Truth begins with an interesting premise, but it is a frustrating story in that none of the characters who could easily remedy the conundrum that arises do so. As such, it is simply not a very realistic story. I suppose that this story might work better for younger readers who may be more interested in plot than in characterization and who are less likely to notice or object to the gaping hole in the plot....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Dec 20, 2018","Dec 20, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/121877.Nothing_But_the_Truth

The resolution was too pat, too easy, and most of Parts Two and Three seemed unnecessary diversions. But then came the penultimate page of the novel: it is a bombshell. It left me reeling. And it made me re-evaluate my opinion of the entire novel. Prior to that penultimate page, Atonement was a novel with a brilliant opening section (Part One) and great characterization of its protagonist, Briony, but the remainder of the novel was distinctly disappointing and too long, filled with material that seemingly added little value to the overall narrative--until everything is seen in light of that momentous revelation on the second-to-last page.

I was stunned and in tears as the novel came to an end. And it's not just some sentimental ending that got me (it's not sentimental at all); rather, the final revelation shifts the reader's perspective on everything that has come before, showing that Parts Two and Three weren't the literary filler that I had previously judged them to be but components whose vital relevance suddenly crystalized starkly.This is not a novel that I will soon, if ever, forget.Well done, Mr. McEwan!

Tragedy, though, is not really an accurate term for Appointment in Samarra as, traditionally, tragedies presuppose gallant, heroic characters who fall from grace. Julian English is not such a character, but his fall is, nevertheless, sad.Julian is a character that, by all rights, we should not like. He comes from a well to do family (his father is a doctor), has a beautiful, intelligent wife, and has what, by all accounts, should be a great job as a Cadillac dealer, but he has gotten himself into trouble because of his own pettiness, stupidity, and selfishness, yet John O'Hara does such a great job of drawing this character that I could not help but hope that somehow Julian would be able to overcome his mistakes and that everything would turn out all right for him. I think this is a case where we are so much in the mind of Julian that we cannot help but identify with him. Although several other characters play prominent roles--Luther (Lute) Fliegler, who works for Julian; Irma Fliegler, Lute's wife; Al Grecco, a mob enforcer; Caroline English, Julian's wife; Ed Charney, a local mob boss and Al's employer--Julian is clearly the central character with the supporting characters, despite being very well drawn in their own right, functioning primarily as role-players in Julian's story. When we are with Julian, we feel slighted and offended when he is slighted and offended. We feel the pressures of his job and his marriage. And we also overlook the fact that he is, in many ways, a complete asshole: he treats his wife terribly; he is rude to his servants; he behaves like a prick: the incident in which he throws a drink in Harry Reilly's face, his blatant flirting with Helene in front of Caroline and their friends, the fight that he gets into with one-armed Froggy Ogden. Practically everything we see of Julian in this novel paints him in a bad light, yet O'Hara still humanizes him enough that we sympathize with him.The ending of this novel is not at all surprising granted Julian's short-tempered, self-pitying, self-centered nature and his desire for an easy solution to his very difficult marital (Caroline seems likely to leave him), financial (he is deeply in debt and his business prospects are dim), and social (his recent behavior has alienated him from many of his friends and the community at large) problems: (view spoiler)[he kills himself by carbon monoxide poisoning, which is an easy, painless method of suicide that totally fits with Julian's character (hide spoiler)]. I like the concise nature of O'Hara's story-telling. He could have easily expanded this novel from its 240 pages (in my version) to 400 or even 500 pages by focusing more on the broad cast of characters and their interesting backgrounds, yet he telescopes the plot very well to the elements most essential to Julian's story and brings the narrative to a quick but unhurried and powerful conclusion.This novel leads me to ponder whether Julian's fate can count as tragic given his nature. Can only the truly great be said to take tragic falls? Or can even those who have serious character flaws suffer tragedy? That is, is it a tragedy when one's terrible fate is not due to the whims of chance or circumstance but rather due to the very poor decisions that one makes, due even to one's very poor character? For me, I would have to say that the answer is, ""no."" Appointment in Samarra is not a tragedy because Julian is not a good person. His fate is the logical outcome of his character and behavior. Unlike many great tragic characters of literature, Julian gets what he deserves. What makes this short novel a great novel, though, is that, despite Julian being such a creep, we still care about him, almost even sympathize with him....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Nov 22, 2018","Nov 23, 2018",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/857127.Appointment_in_Samarra

The first 200 pages were entrancing, but the quality of the novel and my enjoyment of it ever so slowly decreased as the novel continued; unfortunately, there was a lot of novel left after the first 200 pages (676 pages total in my paperback version) so that by the end, I was not only relieved to have finally crossed the finish line but had also come to find reading The Historian a chore, finding only occasional passages engaging.The large middle section of the novel, which is composed primarily of a long letter (well over 400 pages of the novel) from the narrator's father to the narrator, forms the backbone of The Historian, but it is a backbone inflamed with osteoporosis. This epistolary section becomes excruciatingly repetitive to the point of being boring. The writing also grows excessively romantic, even maudlin. And when, at long last, we reach the climax, it is most disappointingly anti-climactic, wrapping up all too quickly and easily.A good editor could have turned this 676-page novel into a 350- to 400-page novel, and it would have been vastly improved even with the sentimental prose that grows ever more pervasive as the novel progresses.As it begins, The Historian holds so much promise to be a great horror novel, but it is gravely disappointing.

Why did it take her so long to act decisively to end their rape and torment? This is not how a real human being would act. -- And now that I have ranted about these bits of inanity (and there are many more that I could have mentioned), my original  is below, but I stand by revising this rating to two stars. Is Blindness trying to teach us something about humanity, or is it more of a reflection of humanity? I'd have to say it's the latter. The novel shows us that the worst circumstances can bring out the most atrocious and disgusting behavior in some humans while producing selfless, compassionate behavior in others. But this is nothing new. We all already know this. Blindness also shows us that we humans are very much a part of the animal kingdom: humans desperately seeking and fighting over food; humans defecating anywhere and everywhere with no shame; humans finding comfort in sex yet also committing rape gleefully and without remorse; humans stealing from and killing each other over food and sex; and humans finding almost their only comfort in sleep. The blindness of the novel reduces humanity to its most bestial impulses. The novel is a richly disgusting sensual palette, painting the stench of humanity--the odors of the body, bodily wastes, blood, vomit, decomposing bodies, rotting food--so vividly that some passages made me sick to my stomach. There is no question that Sarmago is a master of description. But is Saramago trying to tell us that, if civilization were to collapse, many of us would be little better than brutes? I don't think so, for this would be no great insight. We all already know this.So, are we meant to read this novel as an allegory that provides insight into the human condition? I don't think so. There is nothing in this novel that any thinking person does not already know. Instead, the novel to me is a reflection of humanity: it is the product of a writer who is all too aware of the horrors that humanity can commit and has committed but which also recognizes that we are not irredeemable: there is still good in humanity even when confronted with the worst that life has to offer. Again, this is not any deep revelation about humanity. It is a truism to anyone vaguely familiar with the history of our species.In the penultimate paragraph, the doctor's wife comments, ""I don't think we did go blind, I think we are blind, Blind but seeing, Blind people who can see, but do not see"" [sic]. What are we blind to? How good we have it in civilization? Surely, all of us realize how awful it would be to live in a Hobbesian state of nature outside civilization. What then? That we are animals? Again, this we know all too well. That we can behave in ghastly ways? But we know this, too. I found these lines trite and trying to be profound but profoundly failing. I suppose, to be charitable, that I could say that we are generally blind to the comforts of civilization, but this is because we rarely think about what life outside civilization would be like precisely because it is, for the most part, a very remote possibility. But it is not a blindness of ignorance or stupidity: we all readily recognize how terrible life would be for most of us were civilization to collapse.Blindness does not teach us any great lessons. It's a story with a fascinating premise. It has some great conflicts (particularly that between the ""hoodlums"" and the other wards during the quarantine at the mental hospital) and interesting pericopes as the core blind group, led by the doctor's wife, try to survive. But the characterization is weak, and this seems somewhat intentional as Saramago wants to focus on ideas rather than and even at the expense of characters, but because the ideas are really not all that novel or insightful, the lack of character development is a detriment to the novel as whole.Perhaps, however, I've missed the point. Maybe there is some grand metaphor here that I'm not seeing. I had thought that maybe this could be read as an epic work of pessimism or even nihilism: we are all just filthy animals who by pure chance have been raised above the level of beasts, but we are animals just the same with no greater meaning in life than to eat, sleep, reproduce, and die. But I don't think that is a legitimate interpretation of the text. If there is some marvelous meaning in this novel, then I am, ironically, blind to it.I have not read any of Saramago's other works, so I don't know if the prose style in this book is just his typical style or if he was trying to make his style reflect the atmosphere of the novel. If the latter is the case, he did succeed here. The long paragraphs (some of which run to 3 or more pages), the long sentences filled with comma splices, the dialogue written without attribution or quotation marks: this all contributes to a general haziness that at times makes it difficult to see what is going on in the novel: we readers become, to a degree, blind because of the prose style. I found myself both wearied by and appreciative of this style; however, overall, I found the style distracting and unnecessarily obsfuscatory.Blindness is a good story--a haunting story even--that will stick with me mainly for the grotesqueries it describes, but I have learned nothing from this novel. When I ponder Goethe's criteria for evaluating a work of art--(1) what is the creator trying to do? (2) did the creator accomplish it? (3) was it worth doing?--I find myself stumped by the first question: I'm not sure what Saramago is trying to do here, and if the first question is unanswered, then neither can the latter two be answered. Thus, artistically, Blindness is a failure. Blindness as a story qua story is actually an interesting read. Blindness as a story that attempts to communicate some greater message is uninteresting because that message (humans can be both really bad and really good in dire circumstances, or humans are kept from succumbing to their animal nature only by the tenuous and contingent power of civilization) is something that we all know. Because Blindness is a good story, I am giving it three stars even though as work of art, it fails....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Sep 16, 2018","Sep 17, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2526.Blindness

As such, my take on Boom Town is probably not as objective and unbiased as it could be; nevertheless, I think even those who have never been to Oklahoma City and have no real interest in Oklahoma City will still find it a great read.Sam Anderson chooses to tell his history of Oklahoma City through the lens of the city's beloved NBA team, the Thunder. But Boom Town is not just about the Thunder: Anderson begins with the overnight founding of the city in the Land Run of 1889, and he follows the city's fortunes from those early days to the present. Boom Town, however, is not a piece of public relations journalism for Oklahoma City: Anderson depicts the city not only at its best but at its worst: he covers the shameful racism, the rampant corporate greed, the grimy political machinations, and the ridiculous buffoonery and even criminality of some the city's most influential citizens. But he also shows the city at its finest, when it has pulled together to face the consequences of terrible tragedies: as I read Anderson's sections on the bombing of the Murrah Building and the devastating tornadoes of 1999 and 2013 (events of which I have vivid personal memories), I was moved to tears, and even as someone who lived through those events, I still learned a few new things from Anderson's history.Boom Town is a fun, funny, fascinating, heart-breaking, somber, sometimes maddening, and, in the end, inspiring biography of Oklahoma City. Even if you know nothing about Oklahoma City and couldn't even locate it on a map, I think you'll enjoy this book. One caveat: much of this book (probably about a third) is devoted to the Oklahoma City Thunder, so if you're not a basketball fan, these sections might not quite hold your interest, but even I am only a casual fan, and I still found the Thunder sections very engaging. But if you are a basketball fan (especially if you are a Thunder fan), you really need to read this book.Sam Anderson is not a native of Oklahoma City, but in the process of writing this book, as he himself admits, he came to feel like an Oklahoman. I think he fell in love with this city. But as in any truly loving relationship, Anderson still sees the flaws in his beloved, and his book is honest about the city's shortcomings. I loved this book almost as much as I love Oklahoma City, and part of the joy of reading this book, for me, was being able to get an outsider's view--certainly a much more objective view than my own--of my adopted home city.

The sixth family member, the youngest son, Judd, is the novel's narrator, and while he plays a role in the story, his role is relatively minor compared to that of his parents, his sister, and his two brothers, and so we don't get to know Judd, who focuses only very little upon himself, as well as we do his siblings and his parents. The rape of Marianne, the daughter and sister in the family, when she is sixteen is the pivot point around which this story rotates.

But it is a very slow story, and it is slow precisely because there is not a crisis that has to be resolved: the novel is simply the story of the lives of these family members and how they were all affected by Marianne's rape.

While I found Dune to be a very well written novel that entertained me from beginning to end, it did not quite live up to the hype for me: I would not rank it among the top tier of science fiction novels that I have read--though it is far better than average.Dune for me reads more as fantasy than science fiction. It is filled with the magic and mysticism of the Bene Gesserit, the fanaticism and superstition of the Fremen, and the occult soothsaying abilities of Paul (Muad'Dib). Like other fantasy novels, it is a novel of palace intrigue, power struggles, adventures in an exotic land, and war. Apart from space travel, which plays only a tertiary role in Dune, and the Fremen efforts to terraform Arrakis from an extreme desert into a less arid planet, science takes a distant back seat to the fantasy elements and the conflict between Paul and his Fremen supporters and their enemies, the Hakonnens. So while Dune is not among the best science fiction novels that I have read, I have few qualms about placing it among the best fantasy novels.Still, however one might classify Dune, it is a fantastically entertaining read with some very well developed characters and marvelous world-building. I did feel that the novel ended rather abruptly and a bit too easily: Paul's victories--his military conquest of the Harkonnens and his political out-maneuvering of the Padishah emperor by forcing the emperor to give his daughter in marriage to Paul--come about rather hastily with Baron Harkonnen's and the emeperor's forces providing too little resistance based upon their strength and formidability as portrayed earlier in the novel. And so Dune ends with Paul in ascendancy and moving to consolidate his power but with a very uncertain future.

My  may seem overly critical, but that is not reflective of my general experience with this novel. I very much enjoyed reading Dune. The characters are wonderful; the plot is beautifully developed; the world-building is extraordinary; the intrigue and betrayals and adventures in the desert landscape are thoroughly engaging; all of these factors come together in a novel that kept me eagerly turning the pages the entire way through; I was never once even remotely bored.

Rovelli has a tendency to wax poetic and existential, so while the focus of this book is a scientific examination of time, there is also a great deal of personal reflection.Rovelli deconstructs some of the more popular scientific and philosophical views of time and then provides his own view, the details of which are complex and which I won't summarize here as anyone interested should simply read this relatively short book. Having read fairly widely on the physics of time, I can say that Rovelli's view is novel and attractive: to this layperson, it makes sense, which is not always the case in the strange worlds of relativity and quantum physics, and is grounded scientifically, drawn from a cutting edge field of contemporary physics, loop quantum gravity. Rovelli's approach to time makes a valiant effort at resolving the paradoxes that arise in both presentism and eternalism while also providing a fascinating answer to the question of why the universe seems to have been in a low entropy state in its earliest history.For those who are curious about one of the most baffling of metaphysical mysteries, the nature of time, I highly recommend this book....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jul 18, 2018","Jul 18, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36442813-the-order-of-time

TheMere minutes ago, I finished reading We Need to Talk About Kevin, and I am now in desperate need of an intellectual and spiritual palate cleanser. The bleak, gray intellectual nihilism with which this novel begins morphs, by the end of the novel, into the soul-crushing, grievous, cold, black moral and existential nihilism of an unrelenting, unforgiving void. I want to go watch a bunch of upbeat re-runs of Frasier or The Mindy Project. I want to watch some heart-warming or humorous Christmas movies. I long for the comfort, long since departed, that my innocent and hopeful religious faith provided me from early childhood through early adulthood. We Need to Talk About Kevin has left me in an existential stupor, the likes of which no novel has ever before induced.Reading We Need to Talk About Kevin has been a strange experience. At first, I was fascinated by the contentious, hostile relationship between Eva and Kevin. I was psychoanalyzing Kevin throughout and marveling at how, despite the persistent antagonism between him and his mother, Kevin was every bit Eva's son and barely that of his doting father, Franklin. Everything that Eva hated and feared in Kevin could be traced right back to Eva: Kevin's disdain, his arrogance, his cold-heartedness, his quiet, seething anger--all of this we could see, to a degree, in Eva. This is not to say that everything about Kevin had come from Eva: his sociopathic amorality is an anomaly, and that's what makes this novel truly terrifying: in the final analysis, Kevin's evil is ultimately inexplicable. We want a universe that we can understand. We want the ills and evils of this world to somehow make some sort of sense: it was a crime of passion; it was drugs; it was a mental disorder; it was parental abuse; it was due to abject poverty; it was God working in mysterious but ultimately justifiable ways; etc. What we don't want is to dig into the mind of the killer, into the heart of darkness, and find, at bottom, an evil that is not a mere Platonic absence of the Good but rather an impersonal, demoniac force that eats away at hope and light and joy.We Need to Talk About Kevin is so many things. It is a profound and disturbing meditation on parenthood, especially motherhood, and the idols and idylls that society creates around the parent-child relationship. It is a brilliant excoriation of a modern culture that revels in titillation and that is all too eager for consumption of stories of the deepest darkness of which humanity is capable, and, ironically, this very novel itself plays to our fascination with this very type of evil.We Need to Talk About Kevin begins by painting a picture of an indifferent nihilism: a detached amorality that rises above society, that laughs at the slave-morality that Nietzsche skewered. But Shriver shows how this intellectual nihilism oozes into all aspects of life and corrupts everything, ending in mass murder and patricide and sororicide.****SPOILERS AHEAD********SPOILERS AHEAD********SPOILERS AHEAD********SPOILERS AHEAD********SPOILERS AHEAD****What struck me the most about this novel was how harshly the murders of Franklin and Celia affected me. Although I suspected early on that Franklin and, when we finally met her, Celia, might be dead, I was never really certain until Eva discovered their bodies. From the very beginning, we know that Kevin has murdered a handful of classmates, a teacher, and a cafeteria worker, and while these murders are terrible, there is a level of detachment to these murders: one, we don't really know any of these murder victims; and, two, Kevin doesn't have a close relationship with any of them. However, we have seen how Franklin dotes on Kevin and how Celia worships her big brother. Although he has been cruel and heedless of everyone's feelings throughout, I still had hoped that somehow, there was a family bond between him and his father and sister. Thus, their murders left me distraught.While the novel takes us into to the bowels of hell, it does, at long last, give us some small modicum of hope: Kevin's refusal to speak ill of Eva in the interview he gives to the documentary filmmaker; his displaying Eva's picture on his cell wall; his gift to Eva of Celia's prosthetic eye; and finally and most moving, the last exchange he has with Eva in which he lamentably answers her question of why by honestly saying that he doesn't know. Kevin, at long last, seems to be remorseful. Maybe he is not utterly lost. And if he is not lost, then there is still hope for Eva, for all she has left in the world is Kevin.We Need to Talk About Kevin is a remarkable work. It is the best literary portrayal of sociopathy that I have ever encountered as well as being a fascinating exploration of family dynamics. It is also interesting as a pointedly secular, areligious (but not anti-religious) novel. It shows a godless, nihilistic world, and although it does not give us any grand redemption or dramatic spiritual conversions, it does, in the final meeting between Kevin and Eva, show us that the world is not totally devoid of hope....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jul 08, 2018","Jul 08, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11717915-we-need-to-talk-about-kevin

He descThe basic conceit of this story is absurd: Dr. Jekyll believes that we all have two natures warring inside of us, one evil and the other good. He describes these two natures as ""polar twins . . . continuously struggling,"" and he believes that if these twins ""could be housed in separate identities, life would be relieved of all that was unbearable; the unjust might go his way . . . and the just could walk steadfastly and securely on his upward path . . . ""Now, of course, it's not absurd to believe that we all do struggle with conflicting desires, but to believe that we have two separate natures completely opposed is not reflective of how I feel nor, I venture to say, how most people feel. But even if we all felt ourselves torn between good and evil natures struggling within us, I don't think any of us find our moral struggles unbearable. For most of us, we are easily able to make the right choices and don't find making and doing the right thing to be remotely unbearable.Moreover, the idea of splitting ourselves from a complex, morally ambiguous, singular identity into two separate, unambiguous, moral identities does not seem a good solution to the problem of our internal struggles with our conscience: in creating two new identities, we destroy our previous identity. Dr. Jekyll's solution is a form of psychological suicide: the original Dr. Jekyll, with his conflicted conscience, is destroyed in order to produce two new identities: the purified Dr. Jekyll and the evil Mr. Hyde, neither of whom is the same person as the original Dr. Jekyll. Dr. Jekyll, rather than solving the problem of his conflicted conscience, simply evades the problem entirely by creating, through his potion-making, two entirely new identities. And since these two new identities still inhabit the same body, there is still the struggle between these two identities as to which will ultimately control the body, so there is still a rather difficult conflict even with the ""solution"" at which Dr. Jekyll arrives.Because the psychological conceit of and solution to this story are utterly ridiculous, I found the story itself equally ridiculous. Still, the writing is good, and I was entertained and caught up in the story of the murder of Carew, and I did appreciate the way the story ended with Mr. Hyde committing suicide (which seemed a logical outcome granted the arc of the narrative), thus bringing an end to all three identities (the original Dr. Jekyll, the purified Dr. Jekyll, and Mr. Hyde) for good.

ItThe Hunger is without doubt one of the best works of horror fiction I've read in the last decade, and I daresay it's among the best I've ever read. It's also a beautifully structured work of historical fiction, but it's historical fiction with a chilling supernatural twist.Unlike much horror fiction, The Hunger excels at characterization. It doesn't give us cardboard cut-out characters put forth just to be slaughtered or to serve as simplistic villains and heroes; instead, our author, Alma Katsu, gives us layered, complex characters, most of whom are morally ambiguous with a realistic mix of traits such that we go from being disgusted by a character's vice in one chapter to being delighted by her or his virtue in another. Katsu's artistic genius shines in her development of the setting. The landscape of the wagon trail from Missouri to California becomes a character in its own right--from the hot, harsh, parched plains in summer to the brutally frigid, unforgiving snows of the mountains in winter. Nature oppresses and harasses the members of the wagon train to the point of becoming a villain in its own right. This novel submerses the reader in sensory experience: parched throats, starving stomachs, bloodied and gaping gashes, bone-crushing wounds, blackly frostbitten fingers, eerie and unsettling screams and howls, stinking corpses, and reeking human bodies in cramped and crowded tents. You feel, taste, smell, see, and hear all the evil of the unforgiving environment, the human characters, and the animal and supernatural elements. By so pointedly and realistically depicting the sensory world, Katsu places the reader inescapably in the midst of the horror.The Hunger maintains an atmosphere of unease and unsettledness from beginning to end. This is not a novel that relies on jump scares or horrifying encounters (though there are certainly some of these elements in the novel); Katsu creates a realm permeated by a mysterious terror that haunts the reader throughout and never lets up. Finally, The Hunger ends perfectly: (view spoiler)[there is enough redemption in the survival of James Reed and his discovery and rescue of his step-daughter, Virginia Reed, at Truckee Lake, to allow the story to end, despite all of its horrors, on a hopeful note.

It's not really a twist ending; rather, the novel plays on a fairly fundamental assumption that most readers--myself included--will make, and then it reveals that that assumption, while rational and understandable, was completely wrong.I also enjoyed how the author was able to create perhaps the most annoying character I've encountered in quite some time: Francie. Francie is one of the four main characters (the others being Nell, Colette, and Winnie), and all three other main characters as well as Francie's husband find their patience extraordinarily tried by Francie. And Francie definitely drove me bananas as well, but I liked the arc her story took in this novel. It takes a good writer to create such an unlikable character and yet keep that character from being hated by the readers. We don't hate Francie; we just get sick to death of her.Besides not being terribly original, my main problem with The Perfect Mother is the number of red herrings. The red herrings are problematic not because they are red herrings but because they are so obviously red herrings. The story follows numerous tangents down paths that any reader can see are dead ends, and so these red herrings ultimately serve more as filler instead of adding anything of much substance to the story.The Perfect Mother is a quick, easy, and fun read but falls into that category of novels that you enjoy while you're reading but that you largely forget shortly after you finish....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Jun 05, 2018","Jun 05, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35887193-the-perfect-mother

Those hopes were dashed. Foucault's PendulumHaving loved Umberto Eco's earlier novel, The Name of the Rose, I had high hopes for Foucault's Pendulum. Those hopes were dashed. Foucault's Pendulum begins promisingly enough, with the narrator, Casaubon, hiding out in a Paris museum and giving us the back story as to how he finds himself there, and over the first 100 or so pages (of 641 pages), he spins an interesting tale about how his work for a publishing company in Milan has brought him into contact with a number of conspiracy theorists and their works. For those first 100 pages, I was hooked.And then come the final 500-odd pages. These are the pages that try men's and women's souls. The novel becomes a labyrinthine morass of conspiracy theories, tales of from Belbo's childhood during World War II, Casaubon's recollections of his time in Brazil learning about secret societies and attending occult rituals, and various interludes relating to both Belbo's and Casaubon's romantic lives--all told in such a manner as to bore the average reader to tears. But it's not merely boring. It's worse; it's so bad that it's painful. Rarely have I wanted to throw a book across the room, but I felt that urge on many occasions with Foucault's Pendulum. The examination of conspiracy theories that forms the main body of Foucault's Pendulum is both exhausting and trivial; these chaotic ramblings would try the patience even of the most ardent believer in secret societies and mysterious powers that seek to control the world: pages and pages and still more pages discussing the inane ideas and spurious connections posited by innumerable medieval and modern writers about the Templars, the Rosicrucians, the Masons, the Illuminati, the Golden Dawn, and the Assassins. So many times, I wanted to quit, but I pressed on, believing that surely a good end would justify the means of getting to said end through this insipid madness, this horrendous word salad of a middle section. But I was disappointed: the ending is terrible. Although the build-up to the climax that begins about 100 pages before the novel's end is actually pretty good, the climax itself is anticlimactic and unimaginative. I was left cold and frustrated. I cannot help but wonder if Eco intended this massive tome as a farce, as a joke on the reader. Eco is undoubtedly a brilliant writer, and we see flashes of his genius throughout Foucault's Pendulum, but brilliant writers still can and do write tripe. This is tripe. Now, I understand that one can find a larger existential message about the absurdity and ridiculousness of existence in this novel, but I don't need 641 pages of mind-numbing minutiae about the Templars and the Rosicrucians and secret histories to get this message. I hated Foucault's Pendulum. The best part about reading this novel was finishing it and realizing I don't have to return to this stupid, boring world of occult nonsense. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Jun 2018,"Jun 01, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/529103.Foucault_s_Pendulum

Get on that reserve list now!Educated: A Memoir is a truly amazing story. It is for very good reason that it has been on the New York Times nonfiction bestseller list since it was published in February of this year (2018).No  of Educated will do it justice. It is stunning. It is nonfiction with a story that rivals any work of fiction in terms of drama, heart, intensity, and uniqueness. The more you read of this memoir, the more drawn into its heartbreakingly strange, even frightening world you become. While Educated is nothing like a thriller or a mystery, I nonetheless found myself utterly entranced, consuming the pages voraciously and reading as quickly as I could to find out what would happen next, hardly able to set this book aside for any reason. Educated is a story unlike any I have ever read, taking me on a journey to a completely alien world: the world of a little girl growing into a woman in a family of fundamentalist Mormons living in rural Idaho and preparing for the end of the world. This little girl, the author Tara Westover, has a personal story that is tragic yet, happily, also hopeful. Her memoir tells the story of growing up in an exotic (to most of us) family of homeschooling, apocalyptic, survivalist Mormons and growing out of that family as she, through the painful but liberating process of gaining an education that the world outside her circle would see as fairly typical, comes to a new understanding of the world beyond the extremely limited perspective of her family.The most compelling, moving, and terrifying aspect of Educated is Westover's evolving relationship with her family. I don't want to spoil anything, but I will say that the psychological, spiritual, and even physical abuse that she endures at the hands of her own family members left me stunned and gasping. Westover's story makes me extremely grateful for the family that I have, for the way that we all, despite our differences, still very much love and care for each other. This memoir makes me weep for those families, like Westover's, where deep divisions form, where parents separate themselves from children, where siblings cease to talk to one another, where love is replaced with bitterness, anger, and unforgiveness. Educated will will leave you in shock, will make you weep, will make you think, and will educate you. It is an unforgettable story. It is unquestionably one of the best works of nonfiction I have ever read.

The deeper into this novel I progressed, the more engrossed I became and the more difficult I found it to set this novel aside to do necessary things like sleep and work.Too many of the novels in this genre play with the same basic premise--a woman in distress who may or may not be reliable and who suffers from some sort of emotional or psychological issue and who has credibility problems--but don't really do anything much with said premise.

I found myself literally laughing out loud on almost every one of those early pages. After those opening 50 to 60 pages, though, the novel stalls. The characters that I initially found so enchanting do not grow nor show any real depth: they are all caricatures more than characters. By the end of the novel, no one has really changed; all that's different is the circumstances of their lives. Ove is still the grumpy old man that he has always been--even as a young man. The novel tries to show Ove transforming as he interacts with Parvaneh and her family and his other neighbors, but he doesn't really change at all because, although Ove has always been cranky and cantankerous, he has also always been, at heart, a decent, loving person with a great deal of integrity. As the novel opens, we have a cast of characters all of whom are fundamentally good and loving, and as the novel progresses these characters all find new friends to bring within their circle of love. This is not a bad thing at all, but there is no real drama in this novel.Instead, A Man Called Ove is a series of events in the life of Ove. In each of these vignettes, Ove reacts just as we would expect him to from the initial portrait that the novel paints of him. We get the same type of jokes and humor over and over. The novel feels hackneyed and even a bit boring by the end. All of the characters are stereotypes, and we can easily predict how they will act because they always act stereotypically.My negative comments notwithstanding, this isn't a terrible novel. The characters are likable. There are many passages that are delightfully humorous. There is some drama--though the outcome is never really in question. I did find the ending moving in spite of its being quite clichéd. It is a very easy and quick read.

As is usually the case with our idols, the reality falls far short of the myth.The Ingalls family that I grew up loving--especially the patriarch, Charles Ingalls, and author, Laura Ingalls Wilder--were not the largely jovial, struggling yet always eventually successful farm family that the books portray. In fact, while the books are, for the most part, based on historical incidents from the lives of the Ingalls family, they are highly stylized and in many instances fictionalized. This is demonstrated through Fraser's meticulous research, drawing extensively on the correspondence between Laura and her daughter, Rose Wilder Lane.This biography is almost as much a biography of Rose as it is of Laura, for it was Rose who was primarily responsible for her mother's writing career, and Rose edited and, to a small degree, even re-shaped much of the material in her mother's novels--and this biography shows that these books are better classified as novels than as non-fiction. Rose was a well-established writer (something of a yellow journalist) long before her mother even began crafting her novels. It's fairly safe to say that, without Rose, Laura never would have written these novels.Prairie Fires places the lives of the Ingalls family within the historical and cultural context and gives a much more realistic view of life on the prairie than do Laura's novels. As a good biography, it also paints an intimate portrait of Laura and Rose. Sadly (to me), Laura was not an altogether likable person--moody, insolent, prickly, often distant even from her loved ones (even missing her mother's funeral), and constantly fighting with the daughter that she nevertheless loved very much. Still, Laura was ultimately a sympathetic person, but Rose decidedly was not. Rose was fickle, selfish, frequently dishonest, vindictive, and extremely reactionary in terms of her politics. Save for her devotion to her parents, which though it wavered never ultimately failed, Rose had very very little to recommend herself.Prairie Fires is the real story of the Little House world. It's a rather dismal revelation of the harsh nature of life on the prairie in the middle to late nineteenth century, but it is not completely dark, for it does depict the love and even happiness that could still be found in the lives of the pioneers. In the end, this biography shows that the Little House novels and much more so the television show partake far more of myth than reality....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"May 09, 2018","May 09, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/33911349-prairie-fires

And the arsenic icing on this poisonous cake: Lucy steals all of the money that poor Alice inherited from her dead parents. For me, Shakespeare's Iago is the most despicable villain in all of literary history, but in Lucy, Iago has some serious competition. I have to commend Christine Mangan for her boldness in not giving the readers a pat ending where justice is finally served. Oh, no: there is no justice here, and the injustice stings terribly.

Obviously, it's much lauded as a work of political commentary, but Nineteen Eighty-Four is also a horrifying post-apocalyptic novel, with the world of Winston Smith being far more disturbing than any of the dystopian worlds envisioned by contemporary writers.Nineteen Eighty-Four is a suffocating, psychologically draining, emotionally enervating, and physically exhausting novel. The grim, gray grunginess and cold clamminess of the London of Nineteen Eighty-Four made me feel dirty and uncomfortable as I was reading. The inescapable threat to body and mind posed by the Party induced a constant state of unease and paranoia in me as I read. Although I loved this novel, it made me feel so wretched as I was reading it that finishing it was a real relief. Nineteen Eighty-Four shows Orwell to be a master manipulator of the human psyche.The dangers that Orwell highlights in Nineteen Eighty-Four are not restricted to totalitarian states. One can see Orwellian dangers in many groups and ideologies. Of course, many political organizations tend to promote the same type of zeal and unquestioning loyalty that the Party does in Nineteen Eighty-Four, but this fanaticism is also to be found in many religious sects, in some social groups, and even among loosely organized socio-political movements that seek a strict, pure orthodoxy (as seen among, for example, the culture warriors on both the political left and right). The critique that Orwell offers is thus still relevant today although the dangers of an authoritarian state like Oceania arising seem far less likely.In addition to being a great novel of ideas, Nineteen Eighty-Four is exceptionally well written. Orwell's prose is perfectly suited to his subject matter. The language has a gritty realism that punches the reader in the face, that pummels the reader with its literary physicality. In reading this novel, the language imprisons the reader in Oceania. Orwell puts us so completely into the life and mind of Winston that we readers become Winston. Nineteen Eighty-Four feels, in many ways, like a non-fiction memoir; it feels as if it were written by someone who had escaped the oppression of Oceania.I cannot praise this novel highly enough. I love Nineteen Eighty-Four for its ideas, the power of its language, and the story of Winston himself. One of the most tragic, horrifying elements of the story is Winston's ultimate fate: in the end, he comes to truly love Big Brother. The Party apparatus has done something far worse to Winston than to physically torture him or to murder him: it has kept him alive while destroying his soul. And that is utterly terrifying....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Apr 16, 2018","Apr 16, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/492076.Nineteen_Eighty_Four

The story opens about six centuries after the twentieth century as earth is still struggling in the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust that occurred in the twentieth century. The opening section and the subsequent two sections, which are each separated from the other by several hundred years, all focus on an abbey that houses a single monastic order. The main theme that unites all three sections is the danger that nuclear weapons pose to humanity's biological and cultural survival.The opening section was interesting and fairly well done, the second less so, and the third even less so. This story has a fascinating premise but shows a lack of imagination in exploring and developing this premise. Each section focuses primarily on one or two monks and the abbot of that section's time period. There are a lot of petty, internal squabbles as well as conflicts with the world outside the abbey, but the author does very little with the distant future aspect of this story and instead basically tells two stories of medieval monks (the first two sections) and one story of monks living in a world fairly similar to our own but with slightly more advanced technology (the third section), though even in the third section, the advanced technology plays only a tertiary role.If the characterization of the monks and abbots had been better and if the general theme were more nuanced (it's fairly basic and not one really in need of emphasis to most thinking people: beware of nuclear weapons) and if the author had delved more into the science fiction possibilities inherent in his premise, this would have been a much better story.

There are sudden shifts in narrative perspective with no warning. There is a huge cast of characters, and many of the minor characters are difficult to track through the novel's 776 pages. Pynchon often departs from the main narrative to ramble through extended tangents that add little of value to the overall plot--though they are often entertaining and demonstrate Pynchon's breadth of knowledge. Reality, fantasy, and memory often blend together into an indecipherable mass such that we readers are not completely sure what is actually happening.For the most part, I did not enjoy this novel; however, there are numerous episodes that are really very funny. Pynchon has a great sense of humor, and it is a humor that some would say is warped--it is often of a scatological and sexual nature--and seasoned liberally with paranoia and absurdity. Were it not for these recurrent--but still all too infrequent--humorous interludes, I would have hated this novel and rated it one star instead of two.Gravity's Rainbow is so long, so complicated, and so convoluted that, although it clearly displays Pynchon's literary genius, it becomes a chore to read. I have read other notoriously long and difficult novels (Herman Melville's Moby Dick, Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace, Fyodor Dostoevsky's The Brothers Karamazov, James Joyces's Ulysses, Gabriel Garcia Marquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude, David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest, and Roberto Bolaño's 2666, to name a few), and I would say that Gravity's Rainbow ties with Ulysses as the most difficult, but Pynchon's novel is, in my estimation, a more interesting read than Joyce's.Upon finishing this novel, my general feeling was one of relief. I had long wanted to read it and finally made it my new year's resolution for 2018 to read it. I'm glad that I did read it.

He also presents a strong epistemological attack against the possibility of acquiring knowledge by faith, and he gives relatively brief but pointed critiques of the cosmological and teleological arguments.The general tone is somewhat polemical, which may be distasteful to some readers, and some of his attacks on contemporary liberal Christianity are too simplistic. For example, he basically dismisses Tillich and other Christian pantheists as atheists in all but name, which is not fair to their positions.Overall, this is a good read that would be especially valuable to someone unfamiliar with the basic arguments for atheism and against God....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Mar 29, 2018","Mar 29, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/27876535-atheism

It is the story of two young Indian women from a small village. As we follow their lives, their friendship, and their journeys (both geographically as well as personally and psychologically), we are exposed to the degradation and horror of misogyny, poverty, and present-day slavery. But there is a redemptive arc: the faith that these young women have in each other and their friendship.To say that this novel is bleak and pessimistic is accurate, but the point of this novel is not to tell a depressing story; rather, this novel is giving us a glimpse of a reality of which most of us (at least those of us in the West) are grossly ignorant, and this reality is, in many respects, very dark. The two protagonists, Poornima and Savitha, are perfectly realized, and as young women living in a culture where, for many, women have value only as wives and mothers, they experience crushing poverty, sexual harassment and assault, and psychological and physical abuse. Despite living under such conditions, they do not lose hope; their friendship sustains them.This novel left me in tears several times. It was a hard read: reading about sexual and physical violence and abject poverty is never easy, and often we readers fear that Poornima and Savitha will either go on to live lives of great suffering or die young.

It simply does not feel genuine.The Hound of the Baskervilles has the feeling of a story written for the express purpose of trying to sell the story. It simply does not feel genuine. It reads like a tabloid story: a demon dog kills an eldery man and remains on the prowl! Doyle throws in a lurid legend of kidnapping, an escaped convict, a woman abused by her husband, strange goings-on in the night in a huge country estate among the servants, and frequent references to characters having their guns and being ready to use them. Having never previously read any of Doyle's novels, I was was surprised by this level of prurience. The novel is sloppy. The prose is unpolished and unrefined, and there is an obvious error in the narrative timeline: in Chapter 9, Watson writes a letter, dated October 15, to Holmes describing the previous night's adventures (in which he and Sir Henry had chased Selden, the escaped convict, on the moor), and he refers to this event as occurring ""last night"" which would have been the night of October 14. Then, in Chapter 10, we are given a diary entry from Watson dated October 16; before the diary entry, Watson notes that this entry describes the morning after he and Sir Henry had chased Selden; since the diary date is October 16, that would mean the chase occurred the night of October 15, not October 14, as the letter to Holmes indicates. The general mystery itself is not all that mysterious. Early on, the story references the three Baskerville brothers and notes that one had gone to South America, and I immediately thought it likely that this third brother might somehow be involved in the death of Sir Charles, and (view spoiler)[I was right, to a degree: it was the son of the brother who had gone to South America (hide spoiler)]. I was further disappointed that this story does not portray Holmes as making any particularly brilliant or ingenious deductions. One of the main clues that Holmes uses to crack the mystery is seeing a portrait in Baskerville Hall of one of the Baskerville ancestors and seeing a family resemblance to the murderer. This was just not a very intriguing mystery.One final major problem with this story is that we are never told the murderer's ultimate fate. The penultimate chapter ends with Holmes, Watson, and the police detective going to the hideout where the murderer had kept the hound, but the murderer is not there, and they do not immediately give chase and find him. As this chapter ends, the murderer is at large. Then, in the final chapter, we have Holmes explaining to Watson in detail how he solved the case, but he never mentions anything about the murderer either escaping or being apprehended. Maybe it's just me, but this is a pretty important plot detail. I do not mean to imply that The Hound of the Baskervilles is completely bad, though. It was still an entertaining read, and I was interested in the mystery behind the hound: exactly how big was it; why was it so bloodthirsty; why was it thought to be some sort of hell hound? However, the revelation was less than satisfying: it was the size of a small lioness, which is not really all that big; it was half-staved by the murderer, so it was obviously in a state to kill a human for food; and the murderer had coated its muzzle and hackles with phosphorous to give it an eerie glow.One other positive aspect of this novel is that it is very short and is an easy read with a lot of dialogue and action.

Gnomon is one of the most ambitious and imaginative books I have ever read. It is its own unique self while hearkening to (and perhaps paying homage to) Jorge Luis Borges's short stories, Mark Z. Danielewski's House of Leaves, Steven Hall's The Raw Shark Texts, and Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow.I could no more summarize Gnomon than I could the Bible.

It is not an easy read, and if you find yourself lost in the journey that it takes you on, don't be surprised, for what else would you expect from diving into the whirlwind?As I was starting to write this paragraph, I intended to give my justification for rating this novel four stars instead of five. I was going to say that this was a novel that I very much appreciated but did not thoroughly enjoy, and then I immediately went and changed my rating from four to five stars because, although it was a difficult read and not always enjoyable, to rate it only four stars would be an injustice. Yes, it is a long read and is often arduous. You can't just breeze through it like some airport thriller or the sci-fi flavor of the month. This novel is not for the faint of heart. Gnomon is brilliant. It left me breathless. I have a feeling that Gnomon, like Danielewski's House of Leaves, will be one that, years from now, will continue to stand out in my memory for the sheer audacity of the author's vision and the intricate precision of its execution.I often finish a novel and remark to myself how much I enjoyed it. It's not difficult to write interesting and enjoyable novels. But rarely do I finish a novel and say to myself, ""That was impressive.""

And the novel earned these tears through careful, exquisite character building and meticulous storytelling. This is not a sappy, sentimental novel. It is a thoughtful, considered, and utterly engrossing portrayal of a family.The relationships among four siblings (two sisters and two brothers) are at the heart of this novel, and Chloe Benjamin shows the complexity--from the petty rivalries and jealousies on one end of the spectrum to the intense protectiveness and love on the other--of the ties that bind sisters and brothers together from, of course, earliest childhood all the way to the end of life.As I was reading this novel, I was constantly thinking about the title: who are the immortalists, and what makes them immortal? (Minor spoiler for those who think this novel falls into the fantasy genre: no one in this novel is literally immortal.) With a question like this, there can be no concrete, definitive answer, but I'll make a stab at it. To some degree, I think all of us like the idea of immortality, but being humans, we know that literal immortality is not in the cards. So who or what is immortal? This may sound cheesy and trite, but it really is not: I think that this novel teaches us that only love is immortal. The love that binds families and friends together transcends human mortality, and so those of us who partake in this love achieve at least a measure of immortality. When we cut ourselves off from love, we die although we may still live. But when we love, we become immortal even though we die.I should also say something about the expectations that many readers might have about this novel and about the pacing. Much of the press surrounding this novel and even the dust jacket reference the opening scene in which the four siblings go to a fortune teller who tells each one the exact date of her/his death. This is an important element of the story, but it's not what this story is about. This is not a work of fantasy or even of magical realism. This is a work of literary fiction--and very good literary fiction at that.With regards to the pacing, the novel does begin rather slowly. After 30 or 40 pages, I questioned whether I should keep going. I wasn't, at that point in time, all that interested in either the story or the characters. But I am so glad I continued reading. You can't create well developed characters quickly and easily. It takes time, and so Chloe Benjamin slowly and patiently brings her characters to life. And the more you get to know these four siblings, the more you come to love them and to care about their individual and interconnected stories. I loved this book. I found it profoundly moving. Exceptional fiction can teach us deeper, more meaningful, more powerful truths than non-fiction, and The Immortalists is such a novel. This is a novel that will make you weep. It will remind you of what matters most in life....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jan 30, 2018","Jan 30, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30288282-the-immortalists

Feed all of their tired tropes and hackneyed twists and trembling, troubled, yet ultimately triumphant protagonists (oh, how, for the sake of alliteration, I wish the word were trotagonists) into a literary AI, and it will spit out something resembling The Woman in the Window.It's not that The Woman in the Window is a bad novel. It's competently written. It does maintain your interest--at least for the first half and then again near the end. It has moments where you are genuinely flummoxed (in a good way) and moments where you are mildly interested in what might happen next. But there is nothing new here.

This is a novel which, again, you've already read, so you won't be surprised.In four or five months, you'll barely remember any details of this novel. Certainly not the protagonist's name. Nor that of her nemesis. Nor the motives. These types of novels all blur into a morass of forgettable blandness. But perhaps I'm being too harsh. It's not terrible.

Would a world dominated by women be less violent and less oppressive than the patriarchal world in which we now live? Would it be a better world? Would women, in how they rule, show themselves to be morally superior to men? These are the questions asked and answered in The Power.The idea of this novel is inherently fascinating, and mythical tales and legends of the Amazons aside, I can't recall encountering this idea so completely and fully realized elsewhere in literature. Overall, I enjoyed this novel, though the plot is somewhat slow and disjointed for the first third to half of the novel, but by the last half, the narrative momentum moves swiftly and keeps the reader fully engaged. With five primary characters (Allie, Roxy, Margot, Jocelyn, and Tunde), the characterization is underdeveloped. Only Roxy is a fully realized, relatable character. Tunde is also fairly well drawn, but the remaining three characters lack solidity, lack depth. And we do not get to know Allie, Margot, and Jocelyn well enough, nor do we care about them, though this is not the case with Roxy and Tunde. But this is a novel more about the plot than the characters, and with the plot being so good, the problems with the characterization are not so bad.What I most like about this novel is the question that it asks about matriarchy. Many of us (myself included) presume that a matriarchy would be better than a patriarchy. I don't want to spoil anything, so I won't say how this novel addresses this issue, but I will say that the author does a great job of examining this question and does so in a unique and interesting fashion.

The premise, (view spoiler)[an alien race, the Trisolarans, is able to manipulate subatomic particles in higher dimensions: they take a single proton, which is unimaginably vast in higher dimensions, and unfold it into a large sheet in 2-dimensional space; they engrave this unfolded proton with circuits, like a computer chip, such that the single proton is transformed into a computer with computing powers far beyond anything of which humanity's computers are capable (hide spoiler)], grabs the far borders of speculation and pulls them down into the realm of seeming possibility, creating a nearly perfect hard science fiction plot.Like the best science fiction, The Three-Body Problem engages the perennial questions--though perhaps not in as much detail as I would have liked--of moral and existential philosophy and of religion.For the most part, the characters (even the main characters, Wang Miao and Ye Wenjie) are underdeveloped, with the exception of the stand-out character, the brusque yet ever engaging Da Shi (Shi Qiang), but that's not really an issue: The Three-Body Problem has bigger fish to fry. All the men and women are merely players on the world's stage. The bigger drama is that of the world itself and its collision with a strange, distant alien world--a world that is even closer than we might otherwise have thought.For all the science and speculation, this novel still has a lot of heart. It's endlessly fascinating--spiced with danger, mystery, intrigue, and betrayal--and it will keep you turning the pages wanting more and more. The Three-Body Problem will make you think.
