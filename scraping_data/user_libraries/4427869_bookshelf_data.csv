It's sad to see how often our history repeats itself. Mei Lien is the only member of her family to survive a forced deportation by sea from Washington Territory in 1886. She is rescued by a kind man named Joseph McElroy. Joseph promises to keep her safe in spite of the discrimination that prevails against Chinese in his community. Mei Lien is afraid to trust this white man, but sees no other choice.In present day, Inara Erickson discovers an intricately embroidered sleeve hidden in a staircase in the family estate she has just inherited from her aunt. Intrigued by the story told in pictures on the garment, she finds a historian named Daniel to help her interpret the meaning. Initally, Inara intends to sell the estate to pay off her college debt. Being back where she shared many family memories as a child, she quickly becomes attached and decides to honor her dead aunt's wish to convert the estate to a hotel. She persuades her father to invest in her dream. His actions are often infuriating until he somewhat lamely explains them at the end.

She lives in a small French village that isoccupied by the Germans. The new Kommandant in charge of the town decideshis troops will be fed each night at Le Coq Rouge, the family inn inheritedand run by Sophie and her sister, Helene.

Every evening, in spite ofSophie's attempts to protest, Sophie and Helene have no choice but to cookand serve the German troops. One evening, the Kommandant admires the portrait of Sophie painted by herhusband, a little known but gifted artist. The Kommandant is something of anart aficionado and lingers during dinners to talk art with Sophie. He isinfatuated with the painting and apparently with Sophie.

Mike Schwartz has a gift for identifying and developing talent in his teammates. He sees Henry's potential to be a stellar shortstop, helps him get into Westish and make the team. Together they work hard to make Henry's big league dream a reality.So much of this book is about relationships, Mike and Henry, Guert Affenlight and his daughter Pella, their love interests, Henry's roommate Owen and the rest of the baseball team. It's a story about dreams and limits, confidence and doubt, love and friendship . . .oh, and baseball. As a baseball fan, I really enjoyed the details about the game....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Jul 24, 2016","Jul 25, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10996342-the-art-of-fielding

She lives on the family farm with her hardworking father who she adores, her mother, whose disappointment in life and negativity baffle her, and her younger brother Josh. She and Josh have a unique bond and Teddi worships him. Josh too, has a passion. From an early age, he loves and wants to protect the animals in the forest and gorge that border the farm. He is a loner who seems to know the language of animals and birds, often seeing messages in the bird feathers he finds in the woods. Teddi's mother never had a chance to go to college and she desperately wants Teddi to go to school after high school Teddi's dream is to open her own furniture refinishing and antique shop and she can't find a college course to teach her that. To overcome her mother's objections, she literally sneaks away from home in the middle of the night to start a new life in Charleston. Through a series of almost too good to believe encounters with good people. she manages to start her own business. Life seems to be turning out okay until Josh mysteriously disappears.The story is told from Teddi's point of view and alternates between the past when she was a teenager and the present when she is thirty-something. Sometimes the transitions between time periods were confusing. The middle of the book dragged at times, but there was always enough underlying tension about Josh's disappearance to keep turning pages and find out what really happened to him. Is he dead, or as Teddi suspects, he is living among the birds and animals he loves in the deepest part of the forest where even the rangers who taught him as a child don't know how to find him? ...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,"Jul 17, 2016","Jul 17, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16158528-looking-for-me

Forty-something, recently divorced Antoine Rey surprises his sister Melanie for her 40th birthday and takes her to the seaside resort they visited as children. During their stay, memories of those childhood vacations and their mother, who died when they were young children, surface. Melanie remembers something that really shakes her. Before she has a chance to share the memory with Antoine there's a circumstance that erases the memory. Antoine is floundering, still in love with his ex-wife, missing his children and daily family life, feeling lonely and unmoored. He is a man who has difficulty getting close and sharing feelings until he meets a very interesting woman, a mortician named Angele. The development of their relationship is one of the strengths of the story. Their are a lot of family secrets and tragedy's along the way. Because we meet the character's through Antoine's point of view, his detachment keeps them at a distance that made it hard to know and care about them. That dimmed the suspense of some of the family secrets for me. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Jul 08, 2016","Jul 09, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7963208-a-secret-kept

Lucy Wakefield is a seemingly ordinary women until her violently ticking maternal clock propels her to do the unimaginable. What Was Mine is a compelling and distressing story about motherhood and loss on many levels. The writing is unpretentious and the story is told from numerous points of view, as each character looks back over the years since baby Natalie became Mia. I have mixed feelings about the multiple points of view and telling style of writing, which at times is “reporterish.”I usually prefer character driven stories with forward moving action and lot of show in the writing. Some of the points of view fill in another perspective without moving the story forward, and, for me, created distance me from the main characters. It took me about halfway through the novel to appreciate that for this poignant story, the POV’s and telling writing style are exactly what the story needs. Without it, the heartbreak might be daunting. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Mar 15, 2016","Mar 22, 2016","Jun 02, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/25111142-what-was-mine

Fractured has a lot of page-turning strengths, especially in the second half of the novel where the author, Catherine McKenzie skillfully builds tension and suspense. There are also a few elements that make it more of a 3.5 for me. Julie, Daniel and their young twins have just relocated to Cincinnati, mostly to flee Heather, who has stalked Julie for years since a friend died mysteriously when they were in law school together. Julie is now a writer whose debut novel, seemingly based on her friend's death, is a breakout bestseller.John and Hanna live across the street from Julie and Daniel's new house. They have a daughter and a teenage son, Chris. Both couples seem to be happily married, and it seems innocent when John and Julie become friends and start running together most days. After an unfortunate incident between John's son, Chris, and Julie's dog, their relationship develops amidst elevating neighborhood gossip, and Hanna's ire, adding texture to the story and rounding out their own and their spouses characters.The Point of View smoothly alternates between John and Julie and the present and the past. Julie and Daniel's hope that their new Mount Adams neighborhood will provide the privacy and peace of mind to settle down so Julie can get to work on her new novel. That hope is soon dashed by Cindy, an over-zealous , self-appointed neighborhood rule-maker and the mother of Chris's on-again-off-again girlfriend. Cindy takes an immediate dislike to Julie. Soon, there are threats to Julie again and tension builds as Julie obsesses about whether Heather has found her or someone in the neighborhood is behind the harassment. Or could she be fabricating it herself?Cindy is one of my quibbles with the book. Her ""helpful"" behavior is so exaggerated she came across as a caricature to me, straining belief in why other neighbors tolerated her over-the-top rule-making. Supposedly they tolerate her interference because her daughter almost died as a baby, making her over-protective. In addition to the tension about Julie's recurring harassment, suspense builds around well-crafted hints and foreshadowing of an accident. It's unclear until the last chapters is who is ""responsible"" for the accident, and who is the victim. Fractured is a layered story with mostly well-rounded characters and a lot going on under the surface making it a satisfying read. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Oct 15, 2016","Mar 26, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/29477965-fractured

Herta is a German Doctor, working at a female concentration camp, and Kasia Kuzmerick, a Polish teen who gets involved in the resistance. Kasia's sister and mother also play significant roles. Holocaust stories about cruelty and family devastation are not new, and recently, there has been some wonderful women's fiction about the war and resistance. What makes Lilac Girl's different is that it tells the story of Ravensbruck, Hitler's only female only concentration camp. The atrocities at this camp were unspeakable. Women were used in experiments, for example, injected with foreign objects and bacteria and subjected to humane surgeries. All this was done under the guise of ""research"" to find better ways to treat wounded German soldiers. All the characters were compelling. For me, Herta was the least sympathetic and most haunting.

An orphaned pre-teen, living with his alcoholic uncle, Shan is entertaining in Irish pubs to help make ends meet. When his uncle realizes Shan can make more money in Vaudeville, he decides unexpectedly to move them to New York. On the voyage, Shan befriends Nick Capello, a good-hearted, risk-taking scammer. For reasons that unfold as the story progresses, the Capello family take Shan in when they get to New York. Shan is a likable protagonist who is hardworking, wise beyond his years, and loyal to his adopted family. Well researched, The Edge of Lost brings to life issues of the 1920's— immigration, roaring twenties and vaudeville, Prohibition and illegal activities in neighborhoods needing ""protection.""

The story opens and closes in 2011, but most of the story takes place in 1960. Diane Chamberlain chillingly captures the time when women must ask their husband's permission to have a job or take birth control--a time when Eugenics, the practice of sterilizing the ""feeble-minded"" aka known as poor, uneducated who couldn't score well on white-biased IQ testgs was far too easy. The 1960's story is told from two points of view. Ivy is a 15 year old poor, white teen living on a tobacco farm with her grandmother, Nonnie, sister, Mary Ella and illegitimate 2 year-old nephew, Baby William. It's unclear who fathered, Baby William, although there are hints that eventually prove true. Ivy and her ""employers"" teenage son, John Henry are secretly in love--a love they must hide due to their difference in class. The other POV is Jane Forrester, the 22 year old newly married social worker whose husband resents her desire to work. This is Jane's first social work job and she is newly assigned to help the needy families in the area where Ivy lives. Jane quickly becomes emotionally connected to her clients--""caring too much"" in the view of her boss and colleagues.Ultimately this is a story of abused power, trust and love in many forms, and how the determination of one person to risk righting a wrong can prevail....more",Notes are private!,0,35,1,not set,"Nov 25, 2015","Nov 26, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17286747-necessary-lies

Angela Russo is a single, thirty-something event planner in New York. When an important charity event goes all wrong, she loses her job. She impulsively decides to move to Maine to pursue a new relationship with a sailing instructor she met on an online dating site. She befriends the owner of the local coffee shop and ends up working for him, convincing him to expand his business and offer baked goods and soup. That gives her the chance to reconnect with her love of cooking, a skill she learned from her beloved Nonna.This enjoyable read can be summed up as a sweet (if predictable) find-yourself story with just the right touch of romance and recipes.

The primary strength of ""Americanah"" for me is that it made me consider race and class in America in a different way. Candidly and without apology presents the class system not just between whites and blacks but among American and Non-American blacks, and difficulties and discrimination towards immigrants. from page 190 ""In America, racism exists but racist are all gone. Racists belong to the past. Racists are the thin-lipped white people in the movies about the civil rights era. Here's the thing, the manifestation of racism has changed but the language has not.

Ifemelu and Obinze are teenagers in love in Nigeria. They are soul mates who lose their connection when Ifemelu immigrates to America and Obinze, denied American access, goes to London. Their lives cross and uncross and cross again late in the book when both return to Nigeria. I frequently found transitions between different Points of View, place, and time, confusing. There are long sections where the love story seems buried by the racial commentary. At those times, I felt more like I was reading non-fiction. It felt as if there were two different books meshed together, the poignant race discussion told mostly through a very popular blog that Ifemelu starts while in America, and the love story that emerges and submerges. ...more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,not set,"Sep 23, 2015","Aug 28, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15796700-americanah

She is an alcoholic, grieving about being childless, obsessing over and harassing her former husband Tom and his new wife Annie with late night, drunken phone calls. She fantasizes about a couple whose house she passes every day on the train. In her fantasy they are perfectly happy Jess and Jason. In real life they are Megan and Scott. One day, she sees something that suggest they are not as happily married as she imagines. The next day, Megan goes missing and the suspense ramps up. The story was slow for me until that point. Some have compared the twisted infidelity and suspicious spouse to Gone Girl. I saw those similarities. I found the characters in The Girl on the Train much more sympathetic...not exactly likable but not despicable either. It took me awhile to figure out who did it. The author used a device of referring to a character as just him/he, implying it was one character when it might be another.

The historical part is told from the point of Sarah Brown, daughter of abolitionist John Brown. The present day story is told by Eden Anderson, who is mourning the loss of an unborn child and has just moved to New Charleston with her husband of 7 years, Jack. The author does a good job using language that creates a strong sense of the different time periods. Sarah is an artist who helps her abolitionist father by drawing maps to help slaves escape via the Underground Railroad. I enjoyed learning the ingenious ways these maps were hidden in dolls features. At times Eden's behavior felt contrived and immature. Cleo, the little girl next door who lives with her grandfather was an interesting character. The development of the relationship between Cleo and Eden felt predictable.

The characters are sympathetic and their story is compelling. Sisters, Vianne and Isabelle have been somewhat estranged since their grieving and bitter father all but abandoned them after their mother's death. Vianne tried to mother Isabelle, but she was so young and after miscarriages that sent her into depression, Isabelle was sent to convent school. Now Vianne lives a quiet life with her husband, Antoine, and daughter, Sophie in the French village of Carriveau. At 18, Rebellious younger sister Isabelle is still running away and getting expelled from finishing schools. When Antoine gets drafted into the French army to fight the Nazis, Isabelle briefly goes to live with Vianne. Isabelle accurately fears the worse from the Nazis and vows to rebel. Vianne doesn't believe the Nazis will invade France, even after Beck, a Nazis captain moves uninvited into her home. And then Jews in the village including her best friend Rachael first lose their jobs and then their homes and freedom. Vianne promises Rachael to help protect her young daughter and son Ari/Daniel.  The story moves seamlessly from one sisters point of view in the present, to the sister's alternating points of view in the past. Isabelle and Vianne are courageous woman who endure the unendurable and find their own ways to fight the evil. Like so many stories of WW II, there are unspeakable atrocities and heartbreaking losses, and ultimately hope. ...more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,"Apr 11, 2015","Apr 13, 2015","Apr 11, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/21853621-the-nightingale

""INSIDE"" The O'Brien's is the perfect title for this wonderful book because Lisa Genova so skillfully puts us inside each character's world to experience their fear, pain, joy, and hope. She has an amazing talent for creating characters that are familiar, palpable and real without being cliché. From the minute I met Joe O'Brien I felt like I knew him and his wife Rosie. I had heard of Huntington's Disease but had no idea of the course of the disease or that it's hereditary. As the O'Brien family deal with a current diagnosis and the too real threat to the next generation, their fears and hopes, denial, and bargaining really resonated with me. Ms. Genova nails what it feels like to hear an unthinkable diagnosis and learn to live with it. A heartbreaking and hopeful story.I have a quibble about the ending, one of those where I turned the page and gasped out loud, ""Noooo! That can't be the end.""

Beth's husband, Arch, was killed in a plane crash just 3 months before she and her teenage twins go to Nantucket for the summer, maintaining a family tradition. Before he died, Arch invited Marcus, the teenage son of a murderer he is representing, to join the family in Nantucket. Out of a respect for Arch, Beth honors Arch's invitation. The first person Beth's sees in Nantucket is her first love, who is recently separated. His two teenage daughters live with him. As the summer unfolds emotions run rampant as everyone try's to heal from loss, old love and secrets surface, and first love grows. An easy read.

Miri is a teen being brought up in a very loving, supportive family--her single mother, Rusty, her grandmother, Irene whose house they live in, and her Uncle Henry. The story opens in 1987 when Miri is trying to decide if she should board a plane to return to her hometown, Elizabeth NJ. Thirty-five years earlier when she was a teen, a series of unexplained and tragic plane crashes in Elizabeth, changed Miri's and everyone's life. When the story is about Miri and her family and friends and her first love, Mason, I found it wonderfully engaging. At times, that story is over-laid with what feels like short stories or character sketches. These are about the people most effected by the plane crashed.

As a reader it was more of a 3 for me. What I admire most in the writing is the voice of the narrator, Douglas, which never wavers and reveals him as conventional, staid, organized, and self-deprecating in an insightful, witty way. Another strength is that David Nicholls transitions seamlessly between past and present to tell the story of the history and present day marriage of Douglas and his wife, Connie. Interestingly, the voice that I admire so much as a writer, is what I didn't always enjoy as a reader. Douglas is tedious at times, and that made it hard for him to hold my interest, in much the same way that he frustrated his wife Connie and their son, Egg. I admire that the author was able to put me in their shoes and understand their frustration. The problem is, at times it made Douglas a character I didn't want to spend much time with, not a good reaction for a reader.

Love Anthony is told alternating between Beth and Olivia's Points of View. For more than half of the book, it felt more like two separate stories to me. Around 100 pages in, it became clear how the characters would connect. It took many more pages before their stories intertwined. After reading Still Alice, I became an instant Lisa Genova fan. In that book and in Left Neglected, she has a remarkable way of getting inside the characters' head and revealing very serious issues from the inside out. In Love Anthony, the issue is autism, and this time, I never felt the same ""inside-out"" connection. The biggest obstacle for me is that in Love Anthony, I wasn't able to suspend disbelief on how Beth somehow told what was essentially Anthony's story--a child she never met.

It was a solid 4 or better until the shocking revelation in the last few pages, which knocked it down to a 3 or 3.5 for me. The problem I had with this revelation is that after beautifully crafting and showing the bulk of this multi-layered, complex story, Ms. Bodden has one of the narrators ""tell"" her surprising secrets in a way that to me felt like a short cut and out of character. The story is told from two different points of view; Theodora Allen, the mistreated wife of a wealthy plantation owner, and Sarah Campbell, the slave who is his illegitimate daughter. Although only a child, Sarah is the maid to the the Allen's daughter, her half-sister, Clarissa. The characters are very well-drawn and their lives intertwine in ways that are sometimes affectionate and often incestuous. Ms. Bodden did not shy away from the brutality of the times, but often revealed the violence in ways that were not overly graphic. Her less is more approach didn't hide the inhumanity, and made it more readable for me. I always find it hard to read about slavery. Here I was equally disgusted by the inequities in the treatment of women. And, some of the medical practices of the time astounded me.

In Orphan Train, Christina Baker Kline seamlesslyOrphan Train is a well written story and compelling read about friendship, hope, and finding family. In Orphan Train, Christina Baker Kline seamlessly weaves together two stories from different time periods and two character’s points of view. Along the way, she infuses just enough history about the trains that carried Orphans across the county from 1854 to 1929 in search of new families to intrigue without belaboring the story. On the surface Molly and Vivian, the two point-of-view characters, seem to be worlds apart. Molly is an at-risk foster teen who has just narrowly escaped a stint in juvenile detention after stealing of all things, a book from the library. Her foster mother is fed up with her—the feeling is mutual—and her foster father, while a bit more supportive, mostly doesn’t want to cross his wife. Molly has bounced around far too many disappointing foster families, and is cynical and ambivalent. Vivian is a 91 year old rich widow, living alone in a waterfront mansion with too many unused rooms and a cluttered attic she needs cleaned out and organized. Her housekeeper is the mother of Molly’s boyfriend. Through that connection Molly and Vivian meet and agree that Molly fulfill her community service hours by helping Vivian organize her attic. As Molly and Vivian sort through boxes of Vivian’s history, the heart of the story unfolds. They learn they have a great deal in common, form an unlikely friendship, and together learn the meaning of family. ...more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,not set,"Nov 09, 2014","Nov 10, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/15818107-orphan-train

I've been a Beth Kephart fan since hearI received an ARC copy of Going Over in a Goodreads YA for teachers giveaway in exchange for an honest . I've been a Beth Kephart fan since hearing her read at a conference several years ago. In Going Over her writing hits the enviable ( at least for this writer) sweet spot where lyrical prose manages to remain transparent and accessible. The poetry in her prose invokes emotion without being sentimental or calling attention to itself. Bravo.Ada and Stefan are a young couple in love and in danger. Their relationship is shaped by the world they live in--1980's Berlin. Ada lives on the free West side of the dividing wall, and Stefan lives on the east side. Their grandmothers were best friends as young girls and their friendship, like Ada'a and Stefan's love, has endured in spite of the wall and limitations it imposes on togetherness. Ada is strong willed, brave, rebellious. A daycare teacher by day, and a graffiti artist by night, she paints out her frustration and longing, ""graffing"" a mural of heroes in the fight for freedom. At its heart, Going Over is a love story. Distinctive and sympathetic characters like Ada and Stefan's grandmothers and Savas and Meryem (children in the daycare where Ada works) make it so much more.The POV in Going Over alternates between Ada's first person, present account, and Stefan's second person perspective. The immediacy and intimacy of first person present tense engaged me in Ada's chapters. The choice of second person for Stefan's chapters confounded me. It created distance--a sense that Stefan was detached not only from the reader but from himself and his life. Perhaps that is exactly what Ms. Kephart intended. She is too good of a writer to not have carefully crafted this choice. Still, I kept thinking the reason for choosing second person would become apparent. For me, it never did. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Apr 21, 2014","Apr 27, 2014","Apr 21, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17352909-going-over

I suspect fans of Bridget Jones and Jane Green's, Jemina--for the record, I am neither--will rate It Has to be Perfect a 4 or higher. The writing is crisp and the amusing British humor, served up with a light touch will make you smile without pounding you over the head.I’m an American with friends on the British side of the pond, so the wit and sprinkling of colloquial British-ism’s felt familiar and just right.It Has to Be Perfect is not a typical read for me with its occasional, trashy(but story appropriate and not gratuitous) language and lighthearted Sex In The City gone British single woman angst and humor. My reading taste is more plot and character driven women's lit that hits the sweet spot between literary and commercial fiction, hence my 3 star rating for this well written book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Oct 25, 2013","Oct 26, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17878326-it-s-got-to-be-perfect
