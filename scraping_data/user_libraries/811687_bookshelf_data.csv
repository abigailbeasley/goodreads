Seriously, why couldn't he have been the best friend of the gay teen? The story of their friendship was so strong and maybe boys do need to hear that having a close friend who is gay doesn't necessarily mean you are gay. Ari wasn't even questioning his sexuality like Dante was. Heck, he didn't even think he might be gay. His parents told him he was. The thing is that I saw the ending coming a mile away, but it really wasn't the right ending for these characters. Ari couldn't have saved Dante's life or gotten mad at the boys who beat him up just because he was a friend? No, that had to be proof he was in love. The thing is that not every deep friendship has to turn into a romance. It's annoying when a romance is forced into a story where a boy and a girl are friends, and It's annoying here. If Ari had shown any indication of being attracted to guys, I might have bought it. But he didn't and I don't.

It was that farIf I didn't know that ""Brave New World"" was written in 1932, I would have thought it was written in the late Fifties or early Sixties. It was that far ahead of its time in both theme and style. It's easy to see how this book became such a highly regarded literary work. It questions everything and doesn't hand the reader the answers. Unfortunately, I cannot give the book 5 stars. As good as it is, it has some serious flaws. There really isn't a main character. The characters that appear to be the main characters become secondary about half way through the book when a new main character shows up. There is a lengthy and somewhat contradictory philosophical expository section about 40 pages from the end that tries to explain everything but ends up being stilted and not fitting the rest of the book. One character just vanishes. Actually, all of the characters seemed more like symbols than like people. Despite the narrative flaws, Huxley did an excellent job of creating a ""Brave New World"". He is descriptive enough without being too wordy. He shows the reader many aspects of the society depicted, the good and the bad. And, he doesn't tell the reader what to think. I think anyone who has an interest in the future, in science fiction, or in politics should read ""A Brave New World.""
