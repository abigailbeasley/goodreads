I learned after reading it that many of these chapters had previously been published as stand alone stories, which made a lot of sense. I did enjoy the different stories and characters and how they tangentially related to each other, but it was a little jarring in a way to be taken out of the main story so often and then never come back to the side stories. However, that also worked well for me because I listened to the audiobook for this and it was nice to have that complete package of a chapter with its own distinct story to listen to on a walk or on my commute.

I’m still thinking about the last pages and how to give up myself fully to Christ in order to find myself and to become my true self. I liked the following analogy.“Imagine a lot of people who have always lived in the dark. You come and try to describe to them what light is like. You might tell them that if they come into the light that same light would fall on them all and they would all reflect it and thus become what we call visible. Is it not quite possible that they would imagine that, since they were all receiving the same light, and all reacting to it in the same way (i.e. all reflecting it), they would all look alike? Whereas you and I know that the light will in fact bring out, or show up, how different they are.” I appreciate the thought that following Christ, or letting His light in our lives and giving over our will to His, doesn’t take away our individuality, but shines a brighter light and brings more clarity to who we really are and our unique traits.

Then later in the book there was a storyline where one of the characters would regularly do that very thing with someone else, read books and make notes and underline and then share it with the other person.

I want to  it so I can remember my feelings later, but I hardly know where to start. Wow! It actually took me years to finish reading it. I can’t remember when or why I bought it, but occasionally I would pick it up and read a few pages or a chapter. It is challenging and requires concentration, and I am basically always some degree of tired, so I would lose focus or start falling asleep, but something kept drawing me back. The writing is beautiful. The characters are compelling. The situation is haunting. I’d leave it for months and then pick it back up and start to re-read it from the beginning to remember what I had read.Finally, recently, I picked up this book again and started making actual progress. It was still difficult. The jump in timelines can be confusing and I knew absolutely nothing about Chechnya and it’s history. By the end of chapter 12, about halfway through, I was so invested and entranced that I made the decision to start back at the beginning so I could catch and understand better the things I had missed. I also think I never really wanted to be finished. Before re-starting I read up a little bit on the First and Second Chechen Wars and the history of Chechnya. I made a timeline of significant events. Then as I read it again, I fit what was happening into that timeline, which helped a lot.It is a dark and painful story, filled with tragedy and some of the more despicable acts of humanity, with language and situations that certainly offend, but I felt it was balanced by acts of love, beauty, loyalty, sacrifice, hope, and life. The era covered (1994-2004) was a time of chaos, war, death, pain, loss, and betrayal, but the narrator was all-knowing and would give random little glimpses into a happier future, even for minor characters. It gave much needed hope that someday things would be better. For example:“The guard, thirty-one years old, had never received a paycheck, and wouldn’t have known what to do with one if he had; in three years, when the hospital issued paychecks again, beginning with a whopping nine years of back pay, the guard would frame his in glass and hang it on his wall without ever depositing it.”It was startling but comforting to see little hints that someday life would be normal again. People would get paid. The hospital that was practically in ruins would get back on its feet. Those little peeks into the future helped lighten the mood. I appreciated that touch. I finished reading this book in an hours-long session to the end the other day, filled with gasps, flinches, smiles, laughter, tears, even sobs. I told you I was invested.The strange title started to make sense in chapter 12. A character is looking at a medical dictionary. “She flipped through the book and found answers to questions no sane person would ever ask. The definition of a foot. The average length of a femur. Nothing for insanity by grief, or insanity by loneliness, or insanity by reading reference books. What inoculation could the eight-point font provide for the whisper of Sukhois in the sky? Based on the average life expectancy of a Soviet woman, she could expect to live for another forty-eight years, but the Soviet Union had died, and she hadn’t, and the appendices couldn’t explain this discrepancy in data, when the subject outlasted its experiment. Only one entry supplied an adequate definition, and she circled it with red ink, and referred to it nightly. Life: a constellation of vital phenomena—organization, irritability, movement, growth, reproduction, adaptation.”And that’s what you see in the characters. How they grow, move, and adapt to extreme circumstances. The choices they have to make. Life. The good, the bad, the beautiful, the ugly. A full spectrum of human experience beautifully and powerfully shared....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Apr 2020,"Apr 15, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18428067-a-constellation-of-vital-phenomena

It takes place in the South during the time of slavery, the end of 1700s and beginning of the 1800s. It certainly had a lot of good qualities. It was well written and very descriptive, with characters that I cared about and that felt real, but there were so many horrible things that happened that it was hard to take in. I would take long breaks from it, weeks or months, and then decide to give it another chance, and then traumatic things would just keep happening. At one point I thought I should just throw in the towel, but I told myself that if I’m going to be a nurse I have to learn to accept that really bad things happen to people and learn to hear and deal with those stories, although if it had been poorly written or completely without merit I would have given it up. At times things started to look up a little and I could sort of imagine some possible happiness and thought I had gotten through the worst of it, but alas there was plenty more horrible stuff ahead of me. At the end I felt like the author owed me more than she gave me in wrapping it up. It did soften me some to hear the author’s account of how this story came to her almost outside of herself and how emotionally draining it was to write. Sometimes she would try to change certain parts to not be so awful, but then she would get blocked and couldn’t move on from that point until she changed it back. That was interesting and I guess helps explain all the darkness. Slavery was dark. People can do unspeakable things to each other. Life can throw accidents and illnesses and all kinds of terrible things at you. I kind of knew those things and I’m not sure if it was educational or enlightening to be exposed to it all like that, but it does make me appreciate more what I have, the life that I live, the freedoms I have, and the people who love me and treat me well, so I guess that is one valuable reminder I can take from this book....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jan 13, 2015","Jan 13, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6837103-the-kitchen-house

It was kind of a perfect vacation book, mostly light and entertaining, but there were some interesting things to think about as well. The main character is a 39-year-old genetics professor with characteristics of Asperger's syndrome. In studying about Asperger's syndrome he says, ""I formed a provisional conclusion that most of these [symptoms of Asperger's syndrome] were simply variations in human brain function that had been inappropriately medicalized because they did not fit social norms--constructed social norms--that reflected the most common human configurations rather than the full range."" So there is a wide range of normal human behavior and we've decided to make a syndrome for those who are on the outskirts of normal. I see that point, but I also think it can be helpful to identify people that have these characteristics (or symptoms) so that they can get the extra help they need functioning in a very social world. I think identifying with a particular “syndrome” helps them see that there are others like them in the world. I liked when he said, “Asperger’s isn’t a fault. It’s a variant. It’s potentially a major advantage. Asperger’s syndrome is associated with organization, focus, innovative thinking, and rational detachment.” There was some good food for thought, but mostly this book wasn’t about Asperger’s syndrome. It was about a man who is very bright, very organized, very structured in his life and schedule, and very clueless and awkward socially, who decides he wants to find a wife and tries to go about it in a scientific way. There were some confusing or hard to believe aspects to the story, but overall it was funny, charming, sometimes quite touching, and satisfying. The F word was used liberally, unfortunately, by way of warning. Apparently it was originally written as a screenplay and I could definitely imagine it as a movie....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jan 02, 2015","Jan 02, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16181775-the-rosie-project

I lived not far from there for six years growing up, so it was fun to read about that area and remember the landscape. My favorite part was a description of the desert when the rains start.

There were so many interesting stories, sometimes thought-provoking and sometimes unsettling, that made me want to learn more about them and look up further information. I was most interested in the marriage study and the reading of facial expressions. Gladwell's point was a little muddled sometimes. First impressions are good and often better than judgments made after careful thought, but first impressions can be bad. It all depends on your level of experience in the subject, although even if you are an expert you can have underlying prejudices that you don't recognize and can't control.

I see that girl—that dirt-poor, spectacular girl. Sometimes I walk to that field and sink to my knees. I hear my heart beating, but I don’t want to. I hate my heartbeat. It’s too loud in that field. It falls down. Right out of me. But then it just gets back up again.” I kind of love that paragraph, but not in dialogue between two young male friends. I just don’t believe it.There were enough parts that didn’t quite work for me that it lowered my overall opinion a bit, but then there were also many great parts that I thoroughly enjoyed. This is a “young adult” book, written from the perspective of a 19-year-old boy, but I’d say it leans more toward the “adult” than the “young.” It does have a positive, uplifting overall message and some heartwarming stories. On top of that it was fun to read. I think Zusak is an interesting, creative author who showed a lot of growth between this book and “The Book Thief.” I expect I’ll read more by him....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Oct 19, 2011","Oct 19, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/19057.I_Am_the_Messenger

At some point I had just had enough of the story and couldn't motivate myself to keep going. ""Three Cups of Deceit"" refutes many of the stories in ""Three Cups of Tea"" and exposes Greg Mortenson as misusing charitable funds and failing to responsibly account for expenses. The author, Jon Krakauer, had been a previous supporter of Greg Mortenson's charity CAI and had donated money and time as a speaker to help with fundraising. He started to get wind of problems with leadership and use of funds, though, and withdrew his support and finally wrote this book to educate the public about the deception. I felt some of Krakauer's anger and betrayal coming through. I think he made a fairly strong case to support his point, but I think he could have been more balanced by describing more of the good that Mortensen accomplished. From my perspective he seems like a man with great talents, but also great flaws. He is disorganized and inconsistent, probably ADD. He is terrible about returning calls, keeping commitments, being on time, keeping track of expenses, etc. He is great about using his charisma to get things to happen and drumming up support. He dreams big and accomplishes a lot, but maybe not as much as he says or in exactly the way that he says. He seems to have a very flexible relationship with the truth. He let the admiration and success build up his ego and felt he could get away with whatever he wanted. I don't in any way excuse his actions, but I can see how it came about and how that personality works. I think his biggest mistake was not recognizing his own weaknesses and allowing others to help with the financial and organizational side of things, instead of brushing them off and failing to communicate. I think he should be held accountable for his actions and pay back any misused funds. I also hate deceit of any kind and the fact that he made up stories or embellished them or changed facts in a supposedly nonfiction book bothers me a lot. You want to be able to believe what you read, but unfortunately you have to take most things with a grain of salt. For me, I decided that regardless of the truth of some sections of ""Three Cups of Tea"" I can take the positive message of doing what I can to make a difference in the world and help other people. From ""Three Cups of Deceit"" I take the message of being very careful who I give my money to and reminding myself to read even ""nonfiction"" with some skepticism, but hopefully not become completely jaded and untrusting....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Sep 2011,"Sep 03, 2011",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/11151351-three-cups-of-deceit

I don’t know, some of it was just a little too teenage boy for me, and not the kind of teenage boys I want my sons to be, with all the off-color girl talk, drinking, and language. The main story, however, was compelling enough to keep me reading. There were a lot of interesting insights about how we view other people and how they view us and moving beyond two-dimensional images of each other. Even the girl talk came into play there, how they moved from viewing these girls as objects and what they wanted them to be and gradually understanding and knowing them in a more real way. I liked all that and seeing the growth of these characters who were just on the verge of adulthood and still figuring out life. There were parts that made me laugh really hard. There was a mystery aspect that was interesting. It can be hard to get endings right, but I thought the author got it just right. There was a lot of literary analysis as a poem of Walt Whitman’s played a big part in the story, which was fun to read. Overall, it was an entertaining book with some good food for thought.

It would have totally freaked me out thinking he may have pulled some of the same kind of stunts! Not to say he hasn't challenged me in different ways, of course, but overall the teenage years have been much better than I anticipated or worried that they would be. The author did have a rough childhood, though, with no one understanding him or recognizing what was wrong, not to mention having a mentally ill mother and alcoholic father. Reading about his teenage years especially was disturbing and I could see where his guidance counselor was coming from when he said, ""John, some of your tricks are sick. They are evil. They indicate deep-seated emotional problems."" The language in the book was harsh and between that and just a general darkness I almost gave up on it. I was glad I stuck through it, though, because he lived an interesting life and it was good to see his growth and development and especially his insights on himself, his family, and his condition that come in the later chapters. The language also cleans up considerably as it moves into the adult years.I really liked his explanation of the severe end of the autism spectrum as being turned completely inward and gradually more outward-turning as you get to Asperger's and then you have normal and even to an extreme of those who are turned completely outward and lack the ability to be introspective or do calculations in their heads or anything inward-turning. One interesting passage was this:As I recall my own development, I can see how I went through periods where my ability to focus inward and do complex calculation in my mind developed rapidly. When that happened, my ability to solve complex technical or mathematical problems increased, but I withdrew from other people. Later, there were periods where my ability to turn toward other people and the world increased by leaps and bounds. At those times, my intense powers of focused reasoning seemed to diminish. I hadn't thought much about it being a trade-off like that, giving up some of the special gifts to be able to reach out to the world more. In the end that's the path he chose and he found it worth it in terms of his relationships and happiness. It was also good to hear about how learning his diagnosis helped him and the changes he was able to make and the things he was able to accept about himself.I got valuable insights and a look at an interesting life story from reading this book, so while it made me uncomfortable at times, in the end I am glad I read it....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Aug 26, 2011","Aug 28, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/454856.Look_Me_in_the_Eye

It is the kind of book that I generally wouldn't think to pick up and read and I feared it might be a little corny or simplistic or something. It was a quick read, though, and while I didn't agree with every word there was enough good that I got out of it that I was really glad I read it and may read it again sometime to refresh those ideas. I can no longer remember what I may have disagreed with, but I do know it helped me in a positive way while reading it and it really did make me feel happier and change my thinking about certain things. I'll quote part of a blog post I wrote after reading it that describes some of the ways it helped me.I'm reading a book for book club called ""You Can Be Happy No Matter What."" One thing it talked about in there that finally clicked for me was the subject of living in the present. I guess I never totally understood what people meant by ""being present,"" but I'm kind of getting it now. It doesn't mean forgetting the past or ignoring the future, but now I see it as just realizing that the only thing I can control right now is the present. I can't change the past. I can't do much about the future other than the effect from choices I make right now, in the present. I definitely have a tendency to overanalyze and overthink things, but I realized that often it doesn't do me any good at all, and can paralyze me from doing anything. Dwelling on past mistakes, bad habits, guilt, and so on does so much harm. I'm not talking about serious things, just the guilt of not being a better mom, not doing everything I should be, those kind of things. I can't change anything I have done or failed to do in the past, so my new motto is ""What is the best thing I can do right now?"" Somehow that simple question has helped me so much. With painting Josh's room, for example, I refused to let myself think about the past, all the times that painting projects have gotten stalled and taken me forever to finish, or to think too much about the future, as in ""this is going to be hard, I'll have to do all that prep work and clean up and I'll get tired and sore"" or things like that. I just took it one step at a time. Right now I'm going to find the paint and my supplies in the garage. Right now I'm going to wash the walls. Right now I'm going to do the taping. And so on.This also helped me with Gabe's track meet. I was just going to drop him off and pick him up when it was done, but when we got there he was uneasy about everything. It wasn't a normal track meet. There were a lot more people than usual. He wasn't sure how to sign up for his race. Even though we had driven about a half hour to get there, he wanted to just go home since this wasn't a required meet. My first reaction might have just been to take him home and not bother with it. My question, ""What's the best thing I can do right now?"" helped me decide to talk to his coaches about what he needed to do and decide to stay with him for the meet. His race wasn't for over an hour, but I sat in the bleachers and watched that mass of humanity out there stretching, warming up with funny exercises, running, jumping, flying through the air using pole vaults, and I thought about all the energy and motivation of those kids and how great that they all chose to be there doing something so healthy and positive. I enjoyed the cool breeze and spring weather. Instead of thinking about what else I could be doing or feeling restless, I knew that this was the best thing I could be doing. I was ""being present"" and just enjoying the moment in a relaxed way. Everything turned out fine and Gabe did well in his event, the 1500 meter race. I know my reactions were a lot different than they would have been if I hadn't been focused on just making that space in time the best that it could be.So there you go.

It's about losing the diet mentality and having a healthy relationship with food and our bodies. The book is geared toward chronic dieters, which I am not. I don't think I've ever seriously dieted. Sometimes I'll focus on smaller portions or eating healthier, but I'm not about denying myself foods or counting calories. If I'm hungry I eat. Even though it's not written with me in mind so much, I got some useful and interesting things out of it. While reading it I was more aware of my eating habits and learned interesting things about myself that I hadn't realized. I noticed it's not hard for me to wait until I'm hungry to eat unless I am stressed out. Then I just want to eat. I realized if I take smaller amounts and really think about if I'm satisfied before getting more, I usually am and don't need more. I learned that I have a tendency to want to eat food just because it's available and yummy, whether I'm hungry or not, like at a buffet. I don't like letting food go to waste and tend to clean my plate. I liked the author's comment that it's not going to waste, it's going to waist. The book helped me shake off some of those behaviors, at least while reading it. Since I finished it over a month ago, I've become somewhat less conscious again. The authors' ideas are basically that we should give ourselves permission to eat whenever and whatever we want, but we need to be conscious about it. Think about if we are hungry, if the food is really what would be most satisfying to us right then, and so on. And then, even if the answers are no, we can eat it anyway if we choose, but it makes us more aware of why we are eating and prevents us from getting into a deprivation mentality where we then turn to eventual splurging and overeating to compensate. We should also stop eating when we are satisfied, rather than just mindlessly eating because there is still food there. It also covers having a realistic expectation of our bodies and learning to accept and appreciate them for what they do. The ideas made a lot of sense to me and it seems like a healthy, balanced approach to eating....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Jan 23, 2011","Mar 10, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/235869.Intuitive_Eating

I loved reading about how the people of this small community and how the passengers reacted to such an extreme and unusual circumstance and how they really went above and beyond. I still strongly remember how I felt on 9/11 when I learned about the attacks, the gradual dawning of understanding of the magnitude of what had happened, the shock, the fear, the anger. At the time I read all the newspaper articles I could and watched a lot of TV coverage, just trying to understand. Then a few months ago when it hit the 10-year anniversary I watched some of the television programs about it. I am always fascinated by the stories of people, what their first hint was that something was wrong, how they realized what had happened, how they reacted.I actually found this book when I did a search for books about Newfoundland. My parents leave in February to serve a 2-year mission there and I hope to visit them during that time. I wanted to learn more about the area and people and this book was a good choice. The people were amazing. They jumped right in to take care of all these stranded passengers in any way they could. They set up shelters in churches and schools and many offered up their homes. They brought in all the towels, sheets, clothes, toiletries, etc that they could round up. The passengers did not have access to their checked luggage. They offered comfort and support, rides around town, and friendship. They cooked for them and watched over them in the shelters. One store offered up anything they had for free to those in need including tents, sleeping bags, toys, etc. The local pharmacist spent hours and hours on the phone working out prescriptions for passengers who needed them. The local vet and animal lovers diligently cared for the animals from the flight, which were not allowed to be released from a hangar at the airport. An employee at a school that had set up a shelter worked to find kosher meals for three Orthodox Jews that hadn't been eating. She also arranged to convert the kitchen to kosher, including acquiring new pots, pans, utensils, etc, so they could cook there. So many stories of people going above and beyond! It was really touching.It was also interesting to hear the different stories of how people learned what had happened and reacted to it. Imagine being on a flight to the U.S. and then being told that due to an emergency in the United States all air space had been closed. One passenger describes hearing that and how the man in front of her said that he had never heard of the United States closing all its air space. He kept repeating, ""Never."" They couldn't imagine what it meant, what could have happened. It told of the pilots piecing together what had happened and the fear that there could be another terrorist on their plane. One couple had a son who was a firefighter in New York and the fear and uncertainty they felt the whole time as they waited for word on him. I was tearing up through probably the majority of this book just from the intensity of all the feelings, the fear, the sadness, the enormity of the situation, and also because of the touching kindness of the people. The residents offered up all they had with such generosity and kindness and the passengers handled a difficult and confusing time in an admirable way. It's a part of the 9/11 stories that is always so inspiring, people coming together and finding strength and hope in the midst of the horror and fear. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jan 02, 2011","Jan 03, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/148775.The_Day_the_World_Came_to_Town

It's a quick and easy read. It's based on a couple verses in the Bible (1 Chronicles 4:9-10) I received this little book for Christmas from a friend. It's a quick and easy read. It's based on a couple verses in the Bible (1 Chronicles 4:9-10) about a man named Jabez and a prayer he gave. He uses the New King James Version and the verses go like this: 9 Now Jabez was more honorable than his brothers, and his mother called his name Jabez,saying, “Because I bore him in pain.” 10 And Jabez called on the God of Israel saying, “Oh, that You would bless me indeed, and enlarge my territory, that Your hand would be with me, and that You would keep me from evil, that I may not cause pain!” So God granted him what he requested.He goes on to break down the prayer into four parts and talk about each part and how to apply it in our lives. He had some good thoughts and insights. Sometimes I felt like he reached too far and assumed too much, but it was a nice message overall. Some things that stand out to me are the idea of praying for more responsibilities, more opportunities to grow, more ways to help people, and recognizing that we can only do those things with his help. If we are not depending on God very much in our lives, maybe we are keeping things too safe. Maybe we need to stretch ourselves to the point that we need his help. He will provide opportunities for growth and also the help that we need to achieve that. It is kind of a scary thought to step out into doing things that are too hard for us to do alone, but I can see the wisdom in that.I also liked his thoughts on praying to keep us away from evil. I hadn't thought about it, but generally I would pray to be strong in the face of temptations and to withstand evil, but I hadn't really thought about praying to just keep evil and temptation far away from me so I don't even have to deal with it. Sounds nice. So while I didn't agree with every word, I did find some things that inspired me and got me thinking. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Dec 27, 2010","Dec 29, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/103610.The_Prayer_of_Jabez

A young man with Asperger's Syndrome, who has an obsession with forensic science, ends up being charged with murder and put on trial. His difficulties in communication and relating to others complicate the situation and leads to a lot of misunderstandings and problems. It started out pretty good and once the real plot hit it was hard to put down. I figured out what had happened pretty quickly, what we were supposed to think happened, what different characters thought happened, and what really happened. I don't know if that means I'm really smart or if it was just too transparent, ha ha. It's much more satisfying to be surprised and fooled at the end, like I was in The Thirteenth Tale, or maybe at least to not figure it out so soon. It made the rest of the book seem a little long and frustrating because I got tired of nobody else figuring it out, and all it would have taken were a few more questions that any normal human being would have asked. Then, finally, when we get the solution, bam, the book is over with no aftermath. That being said, it was entertaining and kept me interested, if not slightly frustrated and dissatisfied at the end. I will note that the language was a bit harsh at times. On another note, I think the author took every characteristic and story she had heard or researched about Asperger's Syndrome and put it in this one kid and amped it up a little for the purposes of the story. He was definitely more impaired than other cases of Asperger's I have personal experience with (my son) or those I have known of or read about, but then it is all part of a spectrum and it is good to represent that side of it, too, I think, although I might be more inclined to call his condition high-functioning autism.So overall, I'm kind of in the middle.

It was written about the author's experiences growing up in Iran and dealing with the wars and cultural revolution, a complete shift in her early way of life. She is close to the same age as me, so that made it interesting to think about how different our lives were because of where we were born. As a teenager her parents sent her to live in Austria to escape the danger and repression. She faced many challenges in Austria as well and eventually returned to Iran. She had felt out of place as an Iranian in Austria, and then returning to Iran she felt out of place again. Eventually she moved to France and stayed there. This book took me much longer to read than any other graphic novel I've read because it was quite a bit longer, but also very detailed. I learned so much and was really fascinated by it. It was hard to put down. The author is very intelligent and insightful. I didn't always agree with her choices and philosophy, but I could see how she was a product of her family and country. She was so strong and interesting. History, politics, and current events are weak points for me, but reading this in a graphic novel format and hearing it from a personal, female viewpoint really made it accessible to me and helped me gain a much greater understanding of the history and political situation of Iran. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Nov 20, 2010","Nov 30, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/991197.The_Complete_Persepolis

She tells about her experiences with the food and culture and her relationship with her mom, etc. I took a lot of French classes, spent a short time in France once, and am very interested in it, so this sounded really good. Right at the beginning I started to wonder about the author, who was about 22 I think, when she said she started smoking so she would fit in at the outdoor cafes where everyone smokes. Wow. You would think by that age you would know better than to pick up such a stinky, unhealthy habit just to fit in for a month in France. I found that I just couldn't connect with her, not just because of that. Some of the language was harsh. I feel like I have to be careful with the graphic novels because my 11-year-old son is drawn to them. Basically they're cartoons. I really didn't want him seeing this and picking it up. The author also included photographs in the pages and somehow that really drew me out of the world of the drawings. It was interesting to see what the people she wrote about really looked like, but I felt jarred seeing the photographs among the drawings. I didn't realize how I become sort of absorbed in the cartoon world until the photographs would jerk me out of it. I understand the idea behind putting the photos in, but I personally didn't like it. Maybe if they had all been together at the end or something. So even though it wouldn't have taken very long to finish, I just found I didn't care at all and gave up not even halfway through.

He writes about time management, productivity, organization, prioritizing, simplifying, single tasking, focusing, etc. Even though there was nothing really new or extremely original here, it does help to remind myself of some of these ideas. The book was short, straightforward, and easy to read through quickly. I did pull out my notebook and answer questions about what my values are, what my goals are, what I love, what's important to me, and so on, so he got me thinking. He recommends setting just one big goal at a time, something that will take 6 months to a year, and then breaking that down into subgoals that take about a month, then weekly goals. Every day you choose the three most important tasks to accomplish that day and one of these should be leading toward that weekly goal, thus ultimately toward your ""One Goal.""One of Leo's big things is to encourage us to feel more accountable by talking about our goal as much as possible so people will check up on our progress. So in that spirit, I will share that my One Goal (yes, it's always capitalized for some reason) is to completely clean, organize, and paint my house in the next year, to get it in the kind of shape it would need to be in to sell, even though we have no plans to sell. I broke that down into my monthly goals. Each room in the house gets a month for me to deep clean, declutter, and paint. Then there are leftover months to focus on things like outdoors, organizing the garage, repairs, and closets. For the first month I chose getting control of the clothes by completely catching up all laundry and ironing and also weeding through all our clothes to donate what we don't wear anymore or what doesn't fit, etc. Then, of course, all through the year I'll have to continue to maintain the rooms I finish and keep up with the laundry and cleaning.I plan to really start on Monday, November 1 and I'm going to give it 14 months, until the end of 2011, to finish. It does help to have a big plan broken down into little steps. If I really do this, meaning Leo has managed to give me the motivation and tools to make this work, then I will definitely come back to this  at the end of next year and change my rating to 5 stars!...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Oct 28, 2010","Oct 29, 2010","Oct 30, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3467088-the-power-of-less

I went into it without too many expectations or predictions, just ready to let the story play itself out. I think Suzanne Collins has shown herself to be a really good storyteller. The writing itself is pretty straightforward. It’s not particularly poetic or beautifully written, but it’s not distractingly bad or annoying either. It just tells the story and I think that’s her strength. She created a really different and interesting world with flawed but likable and memorable characters and she weaved it all together really well. The part I was most interested in was the characters and their relationships, how they reacted to things that happened to them, how they grew and changed. It was interesting to see the way different characters reacted to horrible and extreme events and the choices they made. I also thought the love triangle was well done. After the first two books I really didn’t know for sure how it would go, though I had suspicions. I could see it going either way, though. During this last book it became obvious to me pretty early where her heart was and it made sense to me. I’m kind of a sucker for romance I guess and I was happy with that aspect of it. I love that with all three books I never knew what to expect, but I learned that I could trust them to be interesting with a lot of surprises and excitement and I was not disappointed. I like going into books knowing as little as possible about them. If you haven’t read it yet, I’m going to mention a couple plot points, but nothing that would really be a spoiler, just general ideas. This is your warning if you don’t even want that, though. If you have read it and want to discuss more specifics than I’m giving here, I’d love to talk more details with you through e-mail or whatever! This is definitely a book that leaves you wanting to talk about it. There were a few things that bothered me. Katniss, the main character, was way too quick to jump to the idea of suicide or murder of friends as a protection from a possibly difficult future such as torture or imprisonment. It just seemed way too hasty and ridiculous. There was a lot of violence and death, some of it quite upsetting, although in the context of war it makes sense. It’s amazing, really, that with the subject matter of these books that I liked them as much as I did. I also felt quite satisfied with the way things were wrapped up, not too sunshiny and unrealistic, but not depressing and hopeless either. I have so often been disappointed by series that started out well and then fell flat. It is nice to find one that I remained happy with throughout. I also think that a trilogy was just the right length for this story.

It might be just what comes across my path at that time. I have books I've been meaning to read for years that I still haven't gotten around to, but I decided I should at least try harder to read books that have been recommended to me. I'm going to stop getting recommendations if I keep ignoring them! So that's how I came to this book. It was recommended to me by my cousin, Lori, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It definitely picks up the mood of books like Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights and celebrates a love of books and words. It made me wish I had grown up in an old bookshop, or could at least work there! The writing was really good and the story was interesting and hard to step away from. We've had some rainy and cold weather while I've been reading it and even got some thunder and lightning the other night. I highly recommend that setting while reading this! The ending was one of those where I think, ""Ahhh, now I have to go back and read the book again and see how I missed that"" and wish I had been smart enough to figure it out.Just a couple of complaints. There was one section describing the actions of a couple of disturbingly heartless people. I felt like what they did was spelled out a little bit too much. I think it would have been nice if the author had taken her cue more from those old books she obviously loves so much and implied things a little bit more in that section, leaving those with the maturity to understand knowing what had happened without giving too many details. I think that part would hold me back from recommending it to a teenager where otherwise I probably would. Then at the end there were just a couple of minor things that kind of bugged me, but not enough to ruin the book, which overall was so well done and a pleasure to read. There were many passages I loved, but here is one to give an example.People disappear when they die. Their voice, their laughter, the warmth of their breath. Their flesh. Eventually their bones. All living memory of them ceases. This is both dreadful and natural. Yet for some there is an exception to this annihilation. For in the books they write they continue to exist. We can rediscover them. Their humor, their tone of voice, their moods. Through the written word they can anger you or make you happy. They can comfort you. They can perplex you. They can alter you. All this, even though they are dead. Like flies in amber, like corpses frozen in ice, that which according to the laws of nature should pass away is, by the miracle of ink on paper, preserved.

There were quite a few parts that were really dark, disturbing, demented, and disgusting—stuff that I’m sure happens in real life, but not the kind of thing I would choose to read and expose myself to if I had known what I was getting into. I just knew that it was quite popular, had received high ratings, and had topped some lists of favorites that I had seen around. I started it kind of warily, knowing that if it turned out to be too violent or disturbing I would quit, but for awhile it wasn’t at all. It set up an interesting mystery and characters I wanted to know more about. I was already really into it when things turned on me, but at that point it was hard for me to give up on the story, so I just sort of endured through the awful stuff and mostly really enjoyed the rest of it. It was a good mystery. The answers weren’t obvious, but I kind of guessed or figured out a lot of things before they were revealed, which was satisfying. It was also interesting reading a book set in Sweden since I can't think of any other book I've read set there.The characters were really interesting to me, especially the title character, Lisbeth. She was “strange,” as she is described many times, but I picked up really early on that she probably had Asperger Syndrome and became more and more sure of it. That was kind of interesting because I just finished “The London Eye Mystery” recently where the main character was a boy with Asperger’s solving a mystery, and then there is “The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time” with that idea as well. So I was interested in her personality. She was obviously shaped by a very difficult childhood and had many flaws, but I couldn’t help but be somewhat sympathetic to her even while totally not understanding or agreeing with many of her choices. I was also interested in Blomkvist, the other main character, who I also rather liked despite some real shortcomings. The characters (not just those two) seemed consistent and real and I felt like the relationships and interactions seemed realistic with who these people were. Overall, other than having to face a repulsive side of humanity, I really did enjoy the book. It held my interest, even in the parts about financial journalism and business, which is quite an accomplishment. It gave me a lot to think about and entertained me at times. I would probably rate it highly, but because of the language and extremely disturbing aspects I don’t feel I could outright recommend it, so I’m just going to forego putting a rating this one. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Aug 26, 2010","Sep 09, 2010","Aug 26, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2429135.The_Girl_with_the_Dragon_Tattoo

This is one I chose for my turn hosting book club in April. It was the first time I chose a book I hadn't read yet, but I felt confident based on some s and the ratings that it would be a good one. What I hadn't realized was how graphic and disturbing some parts would be. I think I would have still read it because I became engrossed in it right from the beginning, but I would not have chosen it for book club recognizing it might be too much for some of the members. One friend in book club asked me what I thought the redeeming value of the book was with all the darkness that was in it. I thought about that for a couple of days and then emailed her, and I'm glad I did because I'll just copy that in the next paragraph as my .The thing I enjoyed most about the book was the storytelling. I think it told a fascinating story that stretched across a great deal of time and touched on several parts of the world. There were little stories within the story that were so interesting like the nun's journey to Africa, Thomas Stone's childhood, Hema and Ghosh's relationship, and so on. I felt like the characters and setting were described well enough that I felt like I knew them and could see them. I really enjoyed the style of writing. I was fascinated by the medical side because that has always interested me. Even people that did really bad things, you kind of got to learn how they got to that point, why they might have made those choices, and they always suffered the consequences of those choices. Some things were really hard to read about. Female circumcision is a horrible, terrifying thing and it was really hard to read about, for example, but it shed light on what that means and how it affects those women throughout their lives. This used to be something very secret and hidden, but because people have been made more aware of it, there are huge movements to stop this kind of thing and help these women now. It is in no way presented as good or acceptable. It's shown as the horrifying thing it is. As I read the book I thought of the Book of Mormon talking about the ""traditions of their fathers."" When people are raised in a certain way with certain belief systems, things that seem normal and right to them may seem crazy and wrong to us, and sometimes they really are! So there were those parts that were difficult, but there were also really good characters that sacrificed for others and loved with all their heart and lived good lives. And there was the message that hanging onto past hurt and grudges is destructive. I don't think I would have chosen this book for book club if I had read it first because of the offending parts, and in the future I doubt I will choose a book again that I hadn't read yet, but I am glad I read it and think it was beautifully written and it gave me a lot to think about. It also gave me a lot of knowledge and understanding of a part of the world I knew very little about.So that was my response. This book completely sucked me in and made me care about the characters, even when they were making me mad. Six months later I still feel like I know those characters. I keep going back and forth between four and five stars on this one. Maybe I'll have to read it again before I decide for sure to see if it holds up. I'll leave off with a quote that I found inspiring.I chose the specialty of surgery because of Matron, that steady presence during my boyhood and adolescence. ""What is the hardest thing you can possibly do?"" she said when I went to her for advice on the darkest day of the first half of my life.I squirmed. How easily Matron probed the gap between ambition and expediency. ""Why must I do what is hardest?""""Because, Marion, you are an instrument of God. Don't leave the instrument sitting it its case, my son. Play! Leave no part of your instrument unexlored. Why settle for 'Three Blind Mice' when you can play the 'Gloria'?""How unfair of Matron to evoke that soaring chorale which always made me feel that I stood with every mortal creature looking up to the heavens in dumb wonder. She understood my unformed character.""But, Matron, I can't dream of playing Bach, the 'Gloria' . . .,"" I said under my breath. I'd never played a string or wind instrument. I couldn't read music.""No, Marion,"" she said, her gaze soft, reaching for me, her gnarled hands rough on my cheeks. ""No, not Bach's 'Gloria.' Yours! Your 'Gloria' lives within you. The greatest sin is not finding it, ignoring what God made possible in you.""...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Mar 10, 2011",Apr 2011,"Aug 24, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6930014-cutting-for-stone

It centered on a vacation the author took by herself to an island beach cottage. She uses symbolism from shells, islands, waves, and so on to illustrate her observations. I related to many of her thoughts and feelings, although she obviously lived a very different life than me. The author, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, was the wife of aviator Charles Lindbergh and seems to have lived basically a life of the rich and famous, what sounds like an adventurous and exciting life, traveling all over the world and learning to fly herself. I got none of this from the book, though. She comes across as very down to earth.Some of the things she wrote were things that I have thought and felt myself, but I wouldn’t have worded them so well or poetically. It is always nice to see feelings I recognize explained by someone else like that. For example, when she describes at the beginning her feeling of coming back to the beach she says, At first, the tired body takes over completely. As on shipboard, one descends into a deck-chair apathy. One is forced against one’s mind, against all tidy resolutions, back into the primeval rhythms of the sea-shore. Rollers on the beach, wind in the pines, the slow flapping of herons across sand dunes, drown out the hectic rhythms of city and suburb, time tables and schedules. One falls under their spell, relaxes, stretches out prone. One becomes, in fact, like the element on which one lies, flattened by the sea; bare, open, empty as the beach, erased by today’s tides of all yesterday’s scribblings.I knew exactly the feeling she was describing. Then there were other parts where she presented ideas or ways of looking at things that I had never thought about before. The “veritable life” of our emotions and our relationships also is intermittent. When you love someone you do not love them all the time, in exactly the same way, from moment to moment. It is an impossibility. It is even a lie to pretend to. And yet this is exactly what most of us demand. We have so little faith in the ebb and flow of life, of love, of relationships. We leap at the flow of the tide and resist in terror its ebb. We are afraid it will never return. We insist on permanency, on duration, on continuity; when the only continuity possible, in life as in love, is in growth, in fluidity—in freedom, in the sense that the dancers are free, barely touching as they pass, but partners in the same pattern. . . One must accept the security of the winged life, of ebb and flow, of intermittency.I really liked that idea of the ebb and flow of life and relationships, the ups and downs, and having faith that the tide will come back in, that things don’t always stay the same, and not to fear the ebb of the tide because that is when you can find the treasures that the sea has been hiding, the beautiful shells and other mysteries of the sea. This book definitely gave me a lot to think about and this was a good time of year to read it as I gear up for life getting busier with kids going back to school and activities picking up. I need to try to remember to prioritize and keep things in balance....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Aug 19, 2010","Aug 22, 2010","Aug 19, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/77295.Gift_from_the_Sea

She had spoken to people about the importance of not leaving the business unattended, but nobody, it seemed, listened . . . It was no use thinking about it and getting hot under the collar because whatever she said she would never be able to change the way people were. Of course she believed in the possibility of change; she had seen many who had become better people from a single experience or from the example of another, but that change was in the big matters, change in the outlook of the heart. It was not change in the little things of life, such as leaving the business unattended--those were things which never changed.I thought that was interesting and thought about it a lot. I go back and forth between thinking change is of course possible and wondering if people can ever really change, but I had never thought to break it down in this way before. The big changes of the heart or way of thinking can happen in a moment. Changing the little things, habits or personality characteristics, can be much, much harder.I always enjoy my little trips back to Botswana and I particularly enjoyed this one!...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Aug 17, 2010","Aug 18, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1605034.The_Miracle_at_Speedy_Motors

This book makes me want to go back and reevaluate all the books I’ve given 5 stars to decide if they really deserved it. I had never heard of this book or author. Gabe (15) had a list of recommended books for English for summer reading that he could choose from and this is the book that Scott and Gabe came home from the library with. I’m actually not sure how they chose it. Maybe it was the first one they looked at that was available. One day while trying to encourage Gabe to get started I read him the first chapter. I figured out from that chapter that this book was probably not the best choice for Gabe. I also figured out that I absolutely wanted to read it. The following is where the author hooked me: Cruelty is a mystery, and the waste of pain. But if we describe a world to compass these things, a world that is a long, brute game, then we bump against another mystery: the inrush of power and light, the canary that sings on the skull. Unless all ages and races of men have been deluded by the same mass hypnotist (who?), there seems to be such a thing as beauty, a grace wholly gratuitous. About five years ago I saw a mockingbird make a straight vertical descent from the roof gutter of a four-story building. It was an act as careless and spontaneous as the curl of a stem or the kindling of a star.The mockingbird took a single step into the air and dropped. His wings were still folded against his sides as though he were singing from a limb and not falling, accelerating thirty-two feet per second per second, through empty air. Just a breath before he would have been dashed to the ground, he unfurled his wings with exact, deliberate care, revealing the broad bars of white, spread his elegant, white-banded tail, and so floated onto the grass. I had just rounded a corner when his insouciant step caught my eye; there was no one else in sight. The fact of his free fall was like the old philosophical conundrum about the tree that falls in the forest. The answer must be, I think, that beauty and grace are performed whether or not we will or sense them. The least we can do is try to be there. I love that! “The least we can do is try to be there.” And that was her goal in the book, to be there. She spent a year observing and writing about nature in the area around her home. I discovered she was much more than just a poet and lover of nature, which would have been enough in itself, but she was also a scientist and researcher. She really knew what she was talking about, what she was seeing. She studied things under microscopes. She talked biology, anatomy, zoology, physics, chemistry, evolution and yet put a spiritual, biblical, and philosophical spin on everything as well without any contradiction. It all comes together. She looks at the dark and ugly as well as the light and beautiful. She goes into details about all kinds of bugs, maggots, and parasites and somehow made me care about it all and think about the deeper significance. This was not an easy book to read. Plenty went over my head, but I actually didn’t mind. It just makes me want to read it again and try to understand more of it. I want to buy this book and underline passages and think about it more. I want to read more from this author. It really fascinated me with its combination of science, faith, beauty, violence, and poetry. I’ll end with a passage near the end of the book. I am a frayed and nibbled survivor in a fallen world, and I am getting along. I am aging and eaten and have done my share of eating too. I am not washed and beautiful, in control of a shining world in which everything fits, but instead am wandering awed about on a splintered wreck I’ve come to care for, whose gnawed trees breathe a delicate air, whose bloodied and scarred creatures are my dearest companions, and whose beauty beats and shines not in its imperfections but overwhelmingly in spite of them, under the wind-rent clouds, upstream and down....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Aug 18, 2010","Oct 20, 2010","Aug 18, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/12527.Pilgrim_at_Tinker_Creek

Many of her memories came from detailed letters written by her and her husband Paul to Paul's twin brother and his wife in the States. What a great thing that they worked so hard to keep in touch and share their lives. The details are so enjoyable and interesting. I loved reading the descriptions of their first impressions of France and the people, culture, food, and landscape. Also included are many of Paul's photographs that add so much to the book. They were so passionate about just soaking it all in, the food and wine and the countryside and all the experiences they could have. I admired the respect they showed for the French people and Julia's desire to learn their language and culture and to accept them, contrasted with some of their American friends that decided French people were cold and rude without really making an effort to get to know them. It was interesting reading about Julia's passion for the food and her desire to learn to cook and all the time and effort she put into that, feeling like she had found her calling in life, and then dedicating the rest of her life to cooking, writing cookbooks, and teaching through classes and later television. She was right about the age I am now when she discovered her ""calling"" and it is interesting to think about what at this point in my life I could still discover about myself. I admired her drive, how completely she devoted herself to perfecting her skills and experimenting and all the time and dedication she put into her recipes and ""cookbookery."" She had so much energy and enthusiasm.My favorite part for sure, though, was just the little details and descriptions that made me feel like I was there in France and made me really want to be there! Here is a description from an early trip they made exploring the country. On the return loop to Paris, we crossed over the mountains, and the scenery changed dramatically. Grasse, a hothouse filled with flowers, gave way to great barren limestone ridges, like hardened taffy, and tumbling rivers that were a bright aqua-blue color from the glacial melt. Nestled into hillsides were little towns where every building was made of local stone that had weathered for hundreds of years. After coffee and aperitifs at Castellane, in a deep mountain valley, we climbed up and up into sparkling cold air, the sun beating warm. Crossing Alpine passes, we drove into a world of evergreens and snow, with towns clustered in the mountain cracks like periwinkles. At Grenoble we drove into a dramatic cloud of icy fog, and spent the night in a snug little hotel in Les Abrets. Later, speaking of their French vacation home that they returned to after moving back to the States, Julia says, Bumping up the rutted driveway, we were struck, once again, by what Paul termed ""the Reverse Hornet-Sting"" of the place--the shockingly fresh and inspirational jolt we got from our lovely hideaway. It was the cool, early-morning layers of fog in the valleys; Esterel's volcanic mountains jutting up out of the glittering sea; the warming Provencal sun and bright-blue sky; the odor of earth and cow dung and burning grapevine prunings; the colorful violets and irises and mimosas; the olives blackening; the sound of little owls talking back and forth; the sea-bottom taste of Belon oysters; the noisy fun of the marketplace; the deeply quiet, sparkling nights with a crescent moon hanging overhead like a lamp.

I've read it many times and it really feels like a part of me. Whenever I read it I feel like I'm going back to visit old friends. I have meant to read Joy in the Morning for years, but somehow didn't get around to it until it was chosen for my book club. I fully expected to love it, but it somehow didn't do the same thing for me that A Tree Grows in Brooklyn did, although I did like it. I think it threw me off at the beginning. First of all the title comes from the scripture verse I think, ""weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning."" The first chapter introduces a young couple getting married. The girl, Annie, reminded me in many ways of Francie from A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, giving me the impression that the author probably based both characters on herself. In that first chapter I saw some behaviors and attitudes in the husband, Carl, that concerned me, so I thought I had it all worked out. They were going to have a very difficult marriage, probably ending unhappily, representing the weeping in the night, and then joy would come in the morning with some kind of happy ending where Annie moves on stronger into a new life. Well, hopefully it's not a spoiler to say that I was completely wrong about the plot. It was more about defying expectations and working through challenges, coming out stronger, which is very good but I just kept being thrown off by what I expected. I also kept getting thrown out of the story because of Annie's interest in reading and writing. I couldn't help but wonder how much was based on the author's life and if she had had some of the same experiences. At one point she writes a little play based on a conversation with Carl, but the outcome is completely different in the way he reacts to things she says and the way the scene ends. I found that really interesting because that is probably what the author does. She takes things from her own life and then changes them to be the way she wished they had been or to be more interesting. So really I think most of the problems I had with it were my own fault, my expectations and my pulling out of the story to analyze and wonder about the author. I do think that even without me doing that, it is not as good of a story as A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. It doesn't have the same scope. It is limited to this couple and their little world and a fairly limited period of time, where A Tree Grows in Brooklyn covered quite a few years and delved into multiple generations and outside stories. Still, it was entertaining and there were some parts I really liked. I'm not sorry at all that I read it, it just didn't quite live up to my high expectations....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Nov 23, 2010","Jun 04, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/14889.Joy_in_the_Morning

It was a great adventure story and I really liked the heroine. I loved listening to it. The author, Philip Pullman, narrated and a full cast did the dialogue. It was so entertaining. I've only heard books read by a single person and listening to it done this way was fabulous. I thought all the actors were great and I especially liked Lyra's part. She was so full of energy, emotion and impulsiveness. I also loved the way Philip Pullman read it. He has a very pleasant voice and I liked that he was telling his own story. Even after listening to it I found myself wanting to read parts of it over. I enjoyed the setting in the far North with the ice and polar bears and the Aurora Borealis. It was just a great kind of escapism. At some point I remember hearing some sort of controversy over the fact that these books were atheist so I was kind of tuned into the religious aspects of it. I don't know about the rest of the series, but I didn't pick up atheism here. It is definitely critical of ""the church"" and it's power and manipulations, but I didn't have a problem with that as it is certainly something that has happened throughout history. I thought the following exchange was interesting. After being told the story of Adam and Eve, Lyra says,""But. . ."" Lyra struggled to find the words she wanted: ""but it en't true, is it? Not true like chemistry or engineering, not that kind of true? There wasn't really an Adam and Eve? The Cassington Scholar told me it was just a kind of fairy tale.""""The Cassington Scholarship is traditionally given to a freethinker; it's his function to challenge the faith of the Scholars. Naturally he'd say that. But think of Adam and Eve like an imaginary number, like the square root of minus one: you can never see any concrete proof that it exists, but if you include it in your equations, you can calculate all manner of things that couldn't be imagined without it.""There were a lot of other interesting thoughts and symbolism, but most of all for me it was just a well-told, exciting story.

I remembered that I really liked it and had thought about doing it for book club, so this year I decided to choose it for book club and I read it again. I also listened a lot of it on CD and thought a lot about it and re-read parts in preparation for book club, so I have spent a long time with this book! When I first started re-reading it I wondered if I had made a mistake. ""Gimmicky"" is the word that came to my mind, with all the different fonts and death as the narrator and all the stylistic stuff, it just seemed like too much. Then there are the millions of metaphors, some that worked and some that just didn't for me at all. It actually took me about 100 pages to really get into it again and start to remember why I loved it, and that love just grew and grew all the way to the end, not that there was nothing worthwhile in the first part, just that it didn’t really start to come all together for me for awhile.The best part for me was the characters. They felt like real people to me and I fell in love with them. The author had a way of describing people that you felt like you really understood them. For example, here is a description of Hans Hubermann: To most people, Hans Hubermann was barely visible. An un-special person. Certainly, his painting skills were excellent. His musical ability was better than average. Somehow, though, and I’m sure you’ve met people like this, he was able to appear as merely part of the background, even if he was standing at the front of a line. He was always just there. Not noticeable. Not important or particularly valuable.The frustration of that appearance, as you can imagine, was its complete misleadence, let’s say. There most definitely was value in him, and it did not go unnoticed by Liesel Meminger. (The human child—so much cannier at times than the stupefyingly ponderous adult.) She saw it immediately.His manner.The quiet air around him.When he turned the light on in the small, callous washroom that night, Liesel observed the strangeness of her foster father’s eyes. They were made of kindness, and silver. Like soft silver, melting. Liesel, upon seeing those eyes, understood that Hans Hubermann was worth a lot. Most of all I fell in love with Rudy, “giver of bread and teddy bears,” and I wasn’t surprised to learn that he was the author’s favorite character. I also loved the story, the “beauty and brutality,” how the best of humanity can rise along with the worst of humanity. It is about a young girl living in Germany during the rise of Hitler and World War II. There are naturally some very sad and awful things, but so many beautiful and positive things too. It is interesting how the author skips around in time so much, telling endings before beginnings, hinting of things to come, misleading us at times, preparing us at times. I ended up really liking that.So while I started out a little worried about some of the unusual aspects of the book, some of those unusual things turned out to be things I loved. Some of my favorite parts were the stories and drawings by Max and his daydreams of boxing with Hitler. I loved how he painted over Mein Kampf and how you could see some of the words bleeding through the paint. This is definitely a book I will want to return to read again and again and I now consider it one of my favorite books....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,Apr 2010,"Apr 18, 2010","Apr 01, 2010",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/19063.The_Book_Thief

It felt like less of a time commitment I guess since I could do other things while listening to it. I think I have only ever listened to an audio book once before, many years ago, but I plan to do it more often. It was a great distraction while I did housework. Boring jobs like dishes and and laundry were made much easier with a good story to listen to. In fact, I found myself looking for little jobs to do so I'd have a reason to listen. The reader was good (not that I have a lot to compare her to) and I thought created pretty distinct and recognizable voices for everyone. Of course the point is the story. It really held my attention and made me want to keep listening. It took place in a futuristic world that I thought was quite well described. The characters were interesting, too. I was a little surprised at the beginning when the main character was described as having tried to drown her sister's cat and declaring that she wanted to forgive her mother (basically for her incapacitating depression over her father's death) but that she wasn't the forgiving type. I really wondered if we were dealing with some kind of sociopath. It is definitely a disturbing storyline and, truthfully, if I had known more what it was about I may not have read it, but I actually ended up really liking the book. It was disturbing, but it was never depicted that this was acceptable or good. It is basically saying, look how twisted this society has become. Something needs to happen to change this. It is not okay. It was really compelling and I definitely want to continue the series.I did wonder after it was over how my experience would have been different if I had read it instead, and since I did end up liking it so much I almost regretted that I hadn't read it, but I have decided to go ahead and check out the next one on audio too and get some more good cleaning done!...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Mar 21, 2010","Apr 01, 2010",,Audio CD,view (with text),/book/show/6080900-the-hunger-games

It seemed like a perfect mix, the enjoyment of the words and the reading of the book mixed with the visual of all the pictures, kind of like a book and movie combined. I was somewhat disappointed, though. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't nearly as good as either the book or the movie. There were some definite limitations. With such limited text, you don't get all the descriptions of the feelings and motivations of the characters, and then with the pictures you don't get the range of emotions and expression you get in a movie obviously. Because of this I felt like the understanding of the characters was really limited. Lizzie in particular came off as very cycnical and unhappy in this version. Although she does have a little bit of cynicism, I think in the book and the movie you see how much it's balanced by her good humor and spirit. This book didn't really capture her humor and teasing fun. There just wasn't enough of her smiling and her energy. Other characters fell a little flat, too, and if I hadn't read the original, I can't say if this would have made me want to.The text was chosen pretty well, mostly using original text but simplifying it somewhat and leaving a few things out. I'm kind of a nitpicker, I know, but in the proposal scene we never get Lizzie's line of ""if you had behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner"" and yet later Darcy brings up that line. My other gripe, but it may be my ignorance, was when Mr. Bennett tells Kitty about all the new rules she will be under and then says, ""If you are a good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a  at the end of them,"" which I always interpreted to mean that after 10 years he would  the rules and loosen them up if she deserves it. I always laugh at that line and Mr. Bennett's teasing and Kitty taking him seriously. In this book he says if she is a good girl for 10 years he will take her to a play. Really? I know revue means something like a play, but I have a hard time believing that's what was meant here.The art was nice and it was kind of a fun way to read it for a change, but I guess my expectations were just higher so I was somewhat disappointed. Really I just wanted to put the book down and go watch the A&E movie, since it has been too long since I've seen that and those actors totally get the characters.

I saw a movie not long ago called ""Adam"" that was really good about a man with Asperger's Syndrome and then just last week saw the series premiere of the TV show ""Parenthood,"" where one of the characters finds out their child has Asperger's. I think I related a little more to both of those other cases than I did to the main character in this book. Actually, there were two characters with Asperger's, the main character, a female doctor, and her older brother. Her brother had mostly been ignored and left to his own devices, where she had received intensive therapies and interventions.As far as the story, it was pretty interesting. I just read ""The Help,"" where I felt like the characters were so real and recognizable and well-described, even the minor characters. In this book I felt frustrated that I didn't even really have a grasp on the major characters, other than maybe the older brother with Asperger's. It was a mystery with some gruesome deaths that aren't really my thing. I like mysteries sometimes, but I'm not a fan of hearing the gory details. I'm also interested in medicine and this was a medical drama. It was somewhat entertaining, but nothing really memorable and parts certainly took a stretch of believability. The biggest impact and the thing I may remember or take away from it is a spoiler, so here's the warning. If you plan to read the book, skip this part, but I don't particularly recommend the book. I don't think it was horrible, so if you like this kind of book, go for it. You may enjoy it.. . . SPOILER ALERT . . .It turned out the mastermind bad guy was the older brother with Asperger's Syndrome. It didn't come as a huge shock to me that he was involved. There had been some little hints that I had picked up on that he at least had something to do with it. Knowing that he tried to murder his own father in cold blood and had no remorse was disturbing, though. I can see how all the elements can come together when you have someone with extreme intelligence, with a very rigid sense of justice, not much flexibility, someone that feels alienated from people and can't quite connect, often rejected or ignored because others can't relate, and with a hard to control temper and inability to just let things go, not to mention difficulty empathizing with others, that all these things could add up to a very bad situation. That's what really got to me. I actually see all these characteristics to some extent in my son, which makes it rather frightening and personal, but I also know that he has a strong sense of right and wrong and that he knows that he is loved. He definitely has more support than this character did. I truly don't believe he would ever go that far, but this did make me think harder about what I can do to help him more. It was eye-opening for sure.

I can read it over and over, and I have! It always makes me smile and laugh, and sometimes makes me cry. I never get tired of it. I can turn to any page and happily jump in to that world. It's one of my comfort books. Jane Austen is so good at developing characters and making them seem real. After seeing the A&E movie so many times it is hard for me to separate that from the book. As I read the book the scenes from the movie are in my head. It is fun getting the extra insight from the book though, and it is much more portable! Here's a passage from the book that I particularly enjoyed. The dialogue is almost identical to the movie, but I love the added commentary in the narration. Caroline Bingley is talking to Mr. Darcy, who she has her sights set on, about Elizabeth Bennett, who she is jealous of because she knows Mr. Darcy is attracted to her. ""For my own part,"" she rejoined, ""I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose wants character; there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive anything extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is intolerable."" Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected. He was resolutely silent however; and, from a determination of making him speak, she continued, ""I remember when we first knew her in Hertfordshire how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, 'She a beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit.' But afterwards she seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time."" ""Yes,"" replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, ""but that was only when I first knew her, for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance."" He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself. Overall this is a funny, entertaining, sweet, and romantic book with great characters and lots of clever dialogue and observations. I have read all of Jane Austen's books, except maybe Northanger Abbey (I can't remember), and although I enjoy them all, this is far and away the best!

""The Age of Innocence"" is the kind of book I read slowly, enjoying the language and the thoughts and just sort of immersing into that time. ""The Help"" was much more of a modern, quick, plot-driven read, the kind of book that I don't want to put down and I stay up late reading to see what happens. I loved both. It wasn't until late in ""The Help"" that the similarities in the stories occurred to me, though. They are both talking about the small, closed, rich white society where anyone different is an outcast. In ""The Age of Innocence"" it's back in 1800s New York City, rejecting those like Ellen who don't fit their narrow view of behavior and propriety. In ""The Help"" it's in 1960's Mississippi, where black people are treated as not quite people and among white people, those that don't fit their ideas of proper dress, behavior, or thinking are shunned and outcast in much the same way they were in ""The Age of Innocence."" Reading this book, I was reminded of the quote that came up in book club last month by Eleanor Roosevelt: ""Great minds discuss ideas; avereage minds discuss events; small minds discuss people.""After reading ""The Age of Innocence"" I was a little bit sympathetic to Newland Archer, not completely, but I wasn't too harsh on his choices. I think Miss Skeeter is the Newland Archer of ""The Help"" and somehow after reading about how she handled being in a similar position as Newland, (on the inside of this closed group, but feeling the pull of more openness and freedom of thought and behavior), I actually look back at Newland and judge him more harshly now. I see how untrue he was being to himself. He was hiding his true thoughts and feelings from those closest to him and he really was living kind of a fake life, even though he did experience some happiness from it. He never had the courage to really live the way he wanted to. Miss Skeeter eventually accepted the consequences of her different viewpoints and allowed herself to be an outcast rather than bend to the ideas of the group. Later when she imagines the life she could have had, there are good things, but overall she thinks she would have felt frustrated, which I think is how Newland felt in the life he chose.Comparisons aside, I think this was a well-written and interesting book. I enjoyed the characters. I had a hard time putting it down. I felt the author did a pretty good job with the different voices, maybe not quite as good as ""The Poisonwood Bible"" for example, but pretty good. (""The Poisonwood Bible is like the gold standard for me now on using different voices.) It was interesting seeing the different points of view and I liked reading about the different character interactions. The book introduced me to a period of time, attitudes, and part of the country that was interesting for me to learn more about. Overall, just a really great book! Not sure if it's quite a 5-star for me, but it's close.

I don't tend to remember books very well after awhile, but I do remember this one made an impact on me. The take-home message for me at the time was to appreciate and enjoy my marriage, not to pine after any lost opportunities or could-have-beens. Probably a good message to take away as a new wife. I remembered the contrast between May and Ellen and have thought about that over the years in other books where the characters are choosing between the ""safe and stable"" type character versus the ""dangerous and exciting."" In fact, I thought of it recently when I read ""New Moon"" and decided I needed to read this book again and really remind myself of it. Then it was chosen for book club, luckily, or it probably would have stayed at the back of my mind to read for a long time.This time around I don't know what clear-cut message I would take from it. It's hard for me to say whether Newland ending up choosing right or not. I think if he had decided differently early on (before he got married) that he actually could have ended up having a happy and interesting life, but I don't think the life he ended up with was bad either. So I guess that's the message for me, make the best choices you can and then live with them in the most honorable and dedicated way you can, which is I guess not too different than my first impression. The thing I really took from it this time was just the experience of feeling like part of a time, place, and culture that is so foreign to me. Their ideas and restrictions and customs were so different. I loved the writing, the descriptions of things that made me feel like I was there, part of that different world. I also found the characters so interesting. Newland certainly had his flaws, but I could feel his experiences, his frustrations and dreams, and he felt real to me. It was interesting being in someone else's mind like that and sort of feeling like I could understand him, even if I didn't always agree with him. And that's really why I read, to understand experiences, people, places, and situations beyond my own, and this book did that for me in a beautiful way....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jan 14, 2010","Jan 23, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/113312.The_Age_of_Innocence

After three failed attempts to start reading this book, I finally read it on the fourth try after the movie came out. I thought I might want to see the movie and I'd rather read the book first. It's things like this that I get hung up on:""I couldn't feel anything but despair until I pulled into the familiar parking lot behind Forks High School and spotted Edward leaning motionlessly against his polished sliver Volvo, like a marble tribute to some forgotten pagan god of beauty."" And a minute later:""We reached Edward then, and he held out his hand for mine. I took it eagerly, forgetting, for a moment, my glum mood. His skin was, as always, smooth, hard, and very cold. He gave my fingers a gentle squeeze. I looked into his liquid topaz eyes, and my heart gave a not-quite-so-gentle squeeze of its own. Hearing the stutter in my heartbeats, he smiled again.""It's just a little much for me, but when the following dialogue happens it made me laugh really hard:""I'd rather die than be with Mike Newton,"" I protested. ""I'd rather die than be with anyone but you."" ""Don't be melodramatic."" Really, Edward? Do you even know Bella? Asking her not to be melodramatic might be stretching it too far. You may just need a new girlfriend.I will say that after I got past the preliminary parts of the book, I really enjoyed it for quite awhile. I was a major fan of Jacob and enjoyed the much more normal and healthy relationship that was developing. I guess the tall, dark, and handsome guy with rough, warm hands and a friendly, sunny disposition is more appealing to me than an ice-cold, hard-as-marble, moody, slightly obsessive vampire. So if I were rating just that section of the book I would probably go with 4 stars. Of course I knew it couldn't last, but I enjoyed it while it did.The rest of it I read just to finish it and see what happened. The climax actually didn't feel much like a climax to me and I was thinking something else big was going to happen and then realized, oh, I guess that was it. After reading it I'm actually in no hurry to see the movie. I'll probably wait for the DVD. I guess there is a little curiosity about where this story goes. Whether it will be enough to entice me to read more of this series remains to be seen I guess.

Interesting that after reading The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society and feeling like there should be more of a distinction between the characters voices, I read this one, which is also told from the point of view of several different characters, but not in letter form as that one was. This author created completely believable characters and different voices and personalities for each one, so that there was no need to go back and remind yourself who was talking because it was obvious. I really enjoyed each character's point of view and the different things they brought to the story.It was a sad and thought-provoking book and also very educational about the history and politics of the Congo (Zaire) and Africa in a way that never got too dry. It wasn't completely depressing, though. There was a lot of beauty and love in there too. So much about this book made me think, and definitely left a lot of unanswered questions for me. How would I cope, coming from my life of comfort and plenty, if I had to live in extreme hunger and danger from the natural world? Why are there so many books where the preacher/religious person is the bad guy? How do you worship creation and ignore the creator? How do you reconcile all the bad things that have been done in the name of religion? Would it really have been better for Africa if they had been left to themselves, or how could things have been different? Obviously their natural resources shouldn't have been exploited and they shouldn't have been taken into slavery and all the evil things that happened, but isn't there something in the middle that could have happened rather than just leaving them in the state they were forever? Isn't there anything good about trying to bring them a higher standard of living and sharing faith and religion? I have a great respect for nature and the environment, but I also don't think an ant's life is as valuable as a human life, or that human sacrifice is acceptable as a form of population control or that treating illnesses with medicine is bad because it upsets the balance of nature.

I guess I thought it would be sort of soap opera-ish and it's so long. Maybe it is soap opera-ish, I don't even know exactly what I mean by that, but I can say that I was hooked from the first page and my interest was held for pretty much the entire 1,000 pages. There were times when I was frustrated or impatient, really wanting to see Scarlett grow up and become a better person. It is interesting to me that the book could center around two characters that are so completely selfish and practically without morals. I was shocked and never really got over Rhett abandoning Scarlett, her 3-year-old son, her teenage slave, her sister-in-law Melanie, who had just given birth (as in within the last day) and was very ill, and her newborn baby in a wagon in the middle of the night to face untold dangers, starvation, enemy soldiers in their path, and possibly no home to arrive at if it had been burned down by the Yankees, as many plantations had. Maybe he was supposed to be noble by joining the Confederate army and maybe he knew that Scarlett was strong and could handle herself, but he couldn't have known what would happen to them, and especially for the fact of Melanie and her baby I just could never forgive him for that. One of the most difficult things to understand with Scarlett was her complete lack of motherly instinct. I was appalled by the following scenes: She rose dizzily to her feet and started walking again. When she came in sight of the house, she saw Wade swinging on the front gate. When he saw her, his face puckered and he began to cry, holding up a grubby bruised finger.""Hurt!"" he sobbed. ""Hurt!""""Hush! Hush! Hush! Or I'll spank you. Go out in the back yard and make mud pies and don't move from there.""""Wade hungwy,"" he sobbed and put the hurt finger in his mouth.I don't care. Go in the back yard. . .and this one:The little boy sobbed, shrinking close to his nurse. ""Make him hush. I can't stand it,"" said Scarlett, taking the horse by the bridle and pulling him to a reluctant start. ""Be a little man, Wade, and stop crying or I will come over there and slap you.""Why had God invented children, she thought savagely as she turned her ankle cruelly on the dark road--useless, crying nuisances they were, always demanding care, always in the way. In her exhaustion there was no room for compassion for the frightened child, trotting by Prissy's side, dragging at her hand and sniffling--only a weariness that she had borne him, only a tired wonder that she had ever married Charles Hamilton.So I think the miracle is, with characters like these, that I loved the book so much. The story was compelling and the writing was amazing. The information about the Civil War and the Southern way of life were fascinating and the bits of history scattered through the book never dragged or got boring. The characters were all so vivid and well described. When I wasn't reading I was thinking about it, thinking about the characters, and wondering what I would do in a situation like war, where your whole world turns upside down and every day is a struggle for survival. Does the end justify the means? It's hard to imagine doing things the way Scarlett did them, but it's also hard to imagine what would have happened to everyone if she hadn't. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Mar 21, 2009","Feb 21, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/526493.Gone_with_the_Wind

This book was really slow and took me quite awhile to get into. It was basically a coming-of-age story of a young boy, looking back from his perspective as a 60-something-year-old man. He reminisces about his family, his experiences, and the beautiful valley in Wales that he spent his life in. His father and brothers were coal miners and the waste from the coal operations was building up on the mountains, growing throughout his life until it eventually drove him from his home. There were a lot of beautiful descriptions of the landscape and family life. Here’s one example.“Beautiful were the days that are gone, and O, for them to be back. The mountain was green, and proud with a good covering of oak and ash, and washing his feet in a streaming river clear as the eyes of God. The winds came down with the scents of the grass and wild flowers, putting a sweetness to our noses, and taking away so that nobody could tell what beauty had been stolen, only that the winds were old robbers who took something from each grass and flower and gave it back again, and gave a little to each of us, and took it away again.”I enjoyed seeing Huw (pronounced Hugh I believe) grow and gain insight and understanding about life. I loved his respect for women that continued to grow. Possibly my favorite part of all was a conversation toward the end of the book with Bronwen, his sister-in-law, where he comes to an even greater understanding and respect of her and all women. I’m tempted to quote the whole conversation, because it was that good, but it was long and would reveal too many plot points from late in the book.There were many other little gems of wisdom and beauty that keep coming to mind after finishing, so even though I kind of had to push myself through it at times, I am really glad I read it. Talking to book club members about it, someone mentioned how older books just tended to be slower like that. We have much shorter attention spans in general these days just because of our faster-paced society, which is really true. I think of most of the older books I have read and there is definitely a lot of dragging, but then they were worth it overall. (The only exception I can think of is “Pride and Prejudice,” which entertains me on every page.) Part of it was my mood at the time.

Our library's first floor is the children's section and the checkout desk, but they have one display shelf of books for adults. A librarian told me once that it is for those parents that have a hard time getting upstairs to the adult section because of little kids. I generally check out books by requesting them online and then just picking them up at the desk, but I saw this one on that display shelf and it caught my eye. Something about the cover and the title caught my attention. I actually had it for quite a few weeks. I was finishing up other books and almost returned it unread since it was almost due. When I was sick in bed with a little flu, though, and wanted something to read, I looked through the stack of books I had available, checked out the first few pages, and this is the one that most grabbed my attention. Now that I've finished it is overdue and I'll have to pay a fine, but it was worth it!As I looked back over other books I've rated and thought about books I love, many of them took some time to really get into or there were certain parts I didn't like as well, even though I ended up overall loving the book. This book was one of those rare books for me that I loved from the beginning and I was never disappointed. The story varied quite a bit from section to section and I liked it all! A young girl with a brilliant mind happens across the legendary Sherlock Holmes in his later years, after the stories by Arthur Conan Doyle take place, and they get to know each other. Holmes trains her (Mary Russell) in his skills and they eventually become partners. Now I confess it seems like a recipe for disaster to take an already established character from another book and put him into a new book by a new author. I personally have never read any Sherlock Holmes books but am familiar with him just through references, probably mostly from the character Dr. House on television, who is based on him. (And there were definitely things about Holmes that reminded me of House.) Maybe if I had read the original books I would be more critical, but as it is I loved his character as well as Mary Russell's. The characters and their interaction was what I really enjoyed most about the book. The mystery was of interest to me mainly in how they responded to it. I loved the writing--the descriptions, the dialogue, the pace of the story, the variation in setting and action, the developing friendship, the suspense. Okay, basically everything. It was a good comfort read and good escapism--a foreign land in a different time with some interesting adventures. I do think that my reaction was partly just hitting on just what I was in the mood for at the right time. I'm not sure it's a book that would withstand multiple readings for me or if it's a book that really enlightened me, inspired me, or added deep understanding like classic literature, but for the purpose of entertainment, it hit the spot and I'm looking forward to reading more of the series when I get a chance. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jan 11, 2009","Jan 04, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1024275.The_Beekeeper_s_Apprentice

With a tight budget, it's an expense I have a hard time justifying, especially when I can get pretty much anything I want to read at the library. I remember, though, that many of the books I read when I was younger are books that I picked off of my parents' bookshelves, and at some point I need to build up a library of books to at least be available to my kids. I decided to start with Shakespeare, so last year I got a set of 30 something paperbacks of Shakespeare's plays for a very reasonable price on eBay (I think about $30). I finally got around to reading one of them myself. I tried starting with King John (picking it randomly), but didn't get very far and didn't really care, so I decided to try again with a light comedy and chose this one.This book was a lot of fun. I have enough familiarity with the style of language that I was able to understand it pretty well, but I still couldn't help myself from looking over at the notes on every page to make sure I understood it right. A lot of times I had, but there were enough times where the notes explained something I hadn't gotten that I couldn't stop doing it. So that was a little distracting and annoying, going back and forth between text and notes, but it did help me understand more. Next time I'll have to try reading straight through though. I think I would enjoy it even more that way.The story follows two couples in love, one is Beatrice and Benedick, who always banter about insults and witty remarks. They are both dead set against love and marriage, but naturally fall in love (with a little help from their friends.) Their conversations are the best part of the book. They are very entertaining. The other couple is Hero and Claudio, who are romantic and sweet, but some mischief on the part of a villain creates a serious problem between them. It's a great story with lots of action and humor!

Instead, just go out and read the book itself right away. I highly recommend it.To set this up, Silas Marner had a bitter disappointment that caused him to lose his faith in God and man. He became a reclusive miser for many years, caring only about the gold that piled up from his work as a weaver. The gold was eventually stolen and some time later a young girl wandered into his home after her mother died in the snow. He decided to keep her as his own and care for her.Unlike the gold which needed nothing, and must be worshiped in close-locked solitude--which was hidden away from the daylight, was deaf to the song of birds, and started to no human tones--Eppie was a creature of endless claims and ever-growing desires, seeking and loving sunshine, and living sounds, and living movements; making trial of everything, with trust in new joy, and stirring the human-kindness in all eyes that looked on her. The gold had kept his thoughts in an ever-repeated circle, leading to nothing beyond itself; but Eppie was an object compacted of changes and hopes that forced his thoughts onward, and carried them far away from their old eager pacing toward the same blank limit--carried them away to the new things that would come with the coming years, when Eppie would have learned to understand how her father Silas cared for her; and made him look for images of that time in the ties and charities that bound together the families of his neighbors. The gold had asked that he should sit weaving longer and longer, deafened and blinded more and more to all things except the monotony of his loom and the repetition of his web; but Eppie called him away from his weaving, and made him think all its pauses a holiday, reawakening his senses with her fresh life, even to the old winter-flies that came crawling forth in the early spring sunshine, and warming him into joy because she had joy....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Nov 23, 2008","Nov 25, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7467406-silas-marner

There were things that bothered me, but there were also things I really liked. The writing style bugged meI’m in the middle of the road on this book. There were things that bothered me, but there were also things I really liked. The writing style bugged me a little. It’s hard to explain but sometimes I feel like authors are just trying too hard. I just want it to sound more natural or real and not like the author is flipping through a thesaurus. An example: As was my routine, I glanced first toward the Cullens’ table. A shiver of panic trembled in my stomach as I realized it was empty. With dwindling hope, my eyes scoured the rest of the cafeteria, hoping to find him alone, waiting for me. The place was nearly filled—Spanish had made us late—but there was no sign of Edward or any of his family. Desolation hit me with crippling strength. I shambled along behind Jessica, not bothering to pretend to listen anymore.I realize this is a young adult book and not classic literature, but I couldn’t help a little eye rolling at times. And I'm no expert, so maybe this is considered great writing, but it's not my preferred style. Also, as I read I’m generally creating the scenes in my head, and there were times when I just couldn’t conjure up a picture. When Edward lifts Bella into the truck with one hand I’m still confused what that would look like. Where does he hold onto. Even if he’s strong enough, wouldn’t that be hurt her if he’s, say, holding her by her arm and lifting her off the ground. Does he scoop her up by her bottom and set her down? Silly probably, but there were quite a few scenes like that where I just couldn’t figure out what I was supposed to be imagining and that bugged me. My other main gripe is their relationship, particularly on Bella’s side. I can imagine that feeling of being swept away by his looks and drawn to him by whatever magnetic force, but I also think at some point, when I have a little distance from him, I’d realize how crazy and dangerous that was and keep my distance. His mood swings were crazy, from laughing to angry to brooding to sweet to jealous and controlling. Personally, I’d have a hard time dealing with that. No thanks! But I know there are plenty of women who like that kind of thing.Despite those things I did enjoy it overall. It was entertaining and interesting. I liked some aspects of the relationship, especially the slow build up in the physical relationship, so that even a brush of the skin was electrifying. I kept turning the pages and wanting to read more. I had predictions that didn’t play out, but maybe will in the following books. I need to be careful making predictions though, because I end up getting so attached to my theories that I get disappointed by the real story. I’m not totally caught up in it or dying to read the next book, but I did put it on hold at the library so when it becomes available I’m sure I’ll continue the series.EDIT: I wrote this a few days ago and just wanted to add that it occurred to me that some of the problem I had with the writing could just be attributed to the fact that it is narrated by a 17-year-old girl. Now, this is more true of when I was 14 or 15 than 17, but I guess I can see saying something like ""Desolation hit me with crippling strength"" if I didn't see a boy I liked. Looking at it from that perspective, I can be more forgiving of the melodramatics....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Oct 25, 2008","Oct 19, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/762743.Twilight

It had some good ideas in it and a lot of things I kind of already knew or do anyway. I described it already a little in the comment section. I guess what I took from it was just to be more aware in general of my boys' emotional needs, to try to talk to them more about feelings. One thing mentioned was how even from babyhood when boys are sad or upset we try to smile or distract them or cheer them up. Apparently it's better to mirror their feelings back a little bit and talk about how they're feeling. Are they sad? frustrated? tired? lonely? etc. Otherwise we're not really teaching them how to deal with their feelings, but just to push them away. We don't do this as much with girls. I have been much more aware of that with Noah and when he is sad or grouchy I try to talk to him about what he is feeling and why and I try to be more sympathetic. Anyway, that's what stuck out from what I read and I'm sure there is a lot more worth reading, which I may get back to doing sometime in the future. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Oct 25, 2008","Oct 06, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2197253.Real_Boys

This story is written from the perspective of an autistic boy so it was really interesting to me on that level, but I feel pretty confident that even someone who doesn't know anyone with autism would enjoy it. The main thing about it that affected me was the relationships. How do parents react emotionally and build a relationship with a child that can never reciprocate on the same emotional level? It was really interesting to me to see how different characters responded to Christopher. There was a wide range of how well people dealt with him and tried to understand him and seeing those relationships was really fascinating to me. There is also a really interesting plot. The language can be harsh, lots of the ""f"" word, but it's not constant throughout, mostly in the fighting or angry scenes. I felt like it was worth putting up with that for the overall story.

That made me laugh, considering the author's history of embellishing and lying in his memoirs, and this is a novel where he should have free rein of his imagination.I noticed the reduced punctuation, sort of like in the other book I just read, The Road. This, however, was more annoying and confusing. It didn't seem to have any real meaning, either, other than laziness maybe. It also seemed kind of random. Sometimes it was there and sometimes it wasn't. I liked the jumping from character to character and wondering how and if they would tie in to each other at some point. The characters stories were interesting and well told. It was fun reading about all these places in Southern California that were familiar to me. I decided last night, though, that I just didn't want to go on in the story. There was just a seediness and evil involved in some of the stories that didn't sit well with me. I know it represents life and lots of great literature has evil involved, including some books I love. I just wasn't up for it. Maybe it turned out to be a great book, I couldn't say. It seemed to have some potential. I just know I reached a point where I decided it wasn't worth it to me. There are too many other books out there that I want to read and not enough time.I did find it funny when he talked about San Bernardino, where I used to live, and mentioned the 16-lane highway. What? There are no 16-lane highways anywhere near San Bernardino. Then later he's talking about Venice Beach, about a homeless man who lives there begging for money to buy alcohol.""It takes Joe between five minutes and three hours to receive the donations necessary to purchase his daily dose of alcohol. If it's summer, and the hordes of tourists are swarming, and there are sometimes as many as 250,000 per day on Venice Beach, the money comes quickly. In the winter, when the number dwindles to as few as 25,000 per day, it might take longer.""Seriously? 250,000 people per day in the summer and 25,000 per day in the winter? That made me laugh for 10 minutes. I'm not all that familiar with Venice Beach, but you've got to be kidding me. I've been to the beach in the winter, maybe not Venice Beach, but you see a handful of people here and there. I have a hard time imagining 25,000 people passing through. Maybe he does these huge exaggerations just to be funny, because they kind of were, or maybe he's just lazy to check out any kind of fact, so his disclaimer at the beginning got him off the hook for that.

It had me hooked from the first couple of pages and I had a hard time putting in down until I was done. It is basically about a man and his son living in a post-apocalyptic world. It is a barren world where nothing can grow any longer, so when the world runs out of whatever food is already there, everyone will die. There is horrible evil all around. There was a particular scene that reminded me of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness. Maybe that was on purpose by the author, I don't know, but it did make me realize that there were similar themes going on about the darkness that men can descend to when civilization is stripped away. I think at the heart of the book, though, was love and goodness and that's what made it bearable.I thought about this book a lot after finishing it. I think for me the point is how we live our lives. All of our time is limited. Here it was a fight for survival, but what's the point of living, say, two more days than someone else because you wouldn't share your food? You still die. At least if you can live with kindness and love, your life itself meant something and brought some joy to yourself and others. I don't think the point is the destination so much as ""the road,"" or the way you get there.The writing was really compelling and different. There was limited punctuation. The lack of quotation marks threw me off a little at first, but I actually ended up being able to follow who was saying what without difficulty. I think it was just down to essentials, just like the characters were, and even their dialogue. Nothing wasted. Here's an excerpt from the beginning to give a feel for the setting and writing:On the far side of the river valley the road passed through a stark black burn. Charred and limbless trunks of trees stretching away on every side. Ash moving over the road and the sagging hands of blind wire strung from the blackened lightpoles whining thinly in the wind. A burned house in a clearing and beyond that a reach of meadowlands stark and gray and a raw red mudbank where a roadworks lay abandoned. Farther along were billboards advertising motels. Everything as it once had been save faded and weathered. At the top of the hill they stood in the cold and the wind, getting their breath. He looked at the boy. I'm all right, the boy said. The man put his hand on his shoulder and nodded toward the open country below them. He got the binoculars out of the cart and stood in the road and glassed the plain down there where the shape of a city stood in the grayness like a charcoal drawing sketched across the waste. Nothing to see. No smoke. Can I see? the boy said. Yes. Of course you can. The boy leaned on the cart and adjusted the wheel. What do you see? the man said. Nothing. He lowered the glasses. It's raining. Yes, the man said. I know.There were disturbing scenes and it was difficult in a way, but I found that I felt kind of detached, sort of like the characters had to be. I didn't cry at all despite very sad situations, but I did think a lot and I am pretty sure this is a book that will stick with me....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Aug 30, 2008","Aug 29, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6288.The_Road

They center on a ladies' detective agency in Botswana, Africa, particularly on the owner, Precious Ramotswe and her cases and the people around her. They are light and easy, sometimes really funny, and sometimes have really interesting little detective cases. I must say this one wasn't as good as I remember previous ones being. It's kind of like a television show where you may like the characters, setting and style, but certain episodes just aren't as good as others. I still liked it overall, but the subplots in this one really didn't do much for me. Sometimes it's funny and sometimes it gets a little old how the author always brings up certain things like Mma Makutsi's 97% test score and Mma Ramotswe's ""traditional build."" I do like the general style of the book and I love Mma Ramotswe's wisdom. She is a great character. Here's an excerpt I really liked that I came across last night as I was finishing the book. It doesn't give anything away as far as the story.""The world, Mma Ramotswe believed, was composed of big things and small things. The big things were written large, and one could not but be aware of them--wars, oppression, the familiar theft by the rich and the strong of those simple things that the poor needed, those scraps which would make their life more bearable; this happened, and could make even the reading of a newspaper an exercise in sorrow. There were all those unkindnesses, palpable, daily, so easily avoidable; but one could not think just of those, thought Mma Ramotswe, or one would spend one's time in tears--and the unkindnesses would continue. So the small things came into their own: small acts of helping others, if one could; small ways of making one's own life better: acts of love, acts of tea, acts of laughter. Clever people might laugh at such simplicity, but, she asked herself, what was their own solution?""There is a lot in these books about appreciating the simple things in life and living a moral life. The main characters are really good, ordinary people that are easy to like.

It's one of my comfort books. Jane Austen is so good at developing characters and making them seem real. After seeing the A&E movie so many times it is hard for me to separate that from the book. As I read the book the scenes from the movie are in my head. It is fun getting the extra insight from the book though, and it is much more portable! Here's a passage from the book that I particularly enjoyed. The dialogue is almost identical to the movie, but I love the added commentary in the narration. Caroline Bingley is talking to Mr. Darcy, who she has her sights set on, about Elizabeth Bennett, who she is jealous of because she knows Mr. Darcy is attracted to her.""For my own part,"" she rejoined, ""I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose wants character; there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive anything extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is intolerable.""Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected. He was resolutely silent however; and, from a determination of making him speak, she continued,""I remember when we first knew her in Hertfordshire how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, 'She a beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit.' But afterwards she seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time.""""Yes,"" replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, ""but that was only when I first knew her, for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.""He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.Overall this is a funny, entertaining, sweet, and romantic book with great characters and lots of clever dialogue and observations.

Aunt Verdella was so open and loving to everyone, always giving people the benefit of the doubt and treating people with such kindness, despite her own disappointments and problems in her life. Then there was Jewel, who was cold and judgmental and rarely displayed any kindness, although she wasn't really a bad person.

I can hardly identify one kind of bird from another, other than obvious distinctions like penguin and owl. Sure, sometimes I'll hear a pretty bird song or notice an unusually colored bird, but for the most part, in spite of my love of nature, birds just haven't captured my interest or attention. Well, I'll tell you how. Sammy has been learning about birds in third grade. He has been pointing out different birds and telling me what kind they are and even talked about birdwatching at recess. I thought it would be fun to get some books from the library about the birds in the area to help identify them and to help me know what he was talking about it. So based on some online searching of the library catalog, this book sounded promising and I requested it along with some others. The others worked for what I had in mind, but this was different.

I started reading it just to see what it was, and really enjoyed the author's style and anecdotes. It was written in a way that I really didn't need any special bird knowledge to enjoy it. It was an easy and interesting read.I doubt that I will ever become much of an expert on birds, but reading this book has led me to appreciate and notice them more.

According to the author, back in the 1800's an Indian chief tried to make a deal with the U.S. government to exchange 1,000 white women for 1,000 horses. They wanted to marry these women and have children with them as a way of blending the cultures and have a legitimate place in the white world. In real life this idea was rejected, but the idea of the novel is that this really happened. It's written as a diary of one of the women that joins this program. I enjoyed the story for awhile, though I was somewhat annoyed by the main character's total lack of respect. I understand having an independent mind and having her own attitudes and beliefs about things, but I felt like she was really disrespectful to basically all religion and to the Native American's beliefs and traditions. I liked it okay, though, up until a character was introduced, Jules Seminole, that was so horrible and disgusting that it totally turned me off. I continued because it was a book club book and I wanted to participate, but it did become rather violent and disturbing for my taste and I felt like I was forcing myself to keep reading and not really enjoying it.

It took me awhile to actually pick it upThis was a choice for my book club and on first looking it over I expected it to be a little slow and boring. It took me awhile to actually pick it up and start reading it, but it didn't take long at all once I started reading it to really get into it. I found the story fascinating. It takes place in the 9th century A.D. and centers around a young woman with great intelligence and ambition. Reading about the religion and general culture of the time and the attitudes toward women was really interesting. The author did seven years of research for the book so I trust that the historical details are mostly accurate. This is a work of fiction and just read as a novel I found it to be a compelling and well-told story. The historical details made it all the more interesting. I think my biggest gripe would be that there are multiple instances where something major happens just in the nick of time that keeps Joan on her course. If it were implied that God was involved in these events because she had a mission to fulfill or something, I might accept that, but that doesn't seem to be the case. They just seem to be contrived conveniences and a little over the top. In the mindset of the book, God really doesn't seem to interfere in the people's lives in any way. That seems to be a big part of Joan's thinking. Her attitude followed the quote, ""Pray as if everything depended on God and work as if everything depended on you."" This quote may have even been in the book or something very similar. She wasn't content to sit around and have faith that God would solve problems, she got to work on them herself, although she did pray also.Joan did many things in the course of the book that were deceptive and downright sinful, which bothered many other members of my book club considering she was outwardly religious and serving God. I definitely see this point, but I feel like I give her a little more lenience based on her circumstances and alternatives. Considering the corruption and wickedness she witnessed among the church and its leaders, including her own horrible father, it is a wonder that she even maintained any faith or goodness. However, there was a point where I felt her actions were inexcusable and unnecessary. Overall, though, I admired her strength, courage, and intelligence and the book certainly made me appreciate how far we've come since the Dark Ages. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Apr 02, 2008","Mar 17, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/351180.Pope_Joan

I've been trying to read some more classics in the past year or so and I am truly learning why they are classics. It definitely makes me less tolerant of all the junk out there. There is just something uplifting about good writing, even when it's a depressing story like this one. Somehow it just draws you in. This book is very dark, mysterious, and dreamlike. You sort of travel with the narrator, a sailor named Marlow, who I guess actually is narrating the story to our narrator, into this primitive world in the heart of Africa during colonial times, far from civilization. Marlow focuses on a man he meets there who was so intelligent and had so much promise and then got drawn into mysterious tribal rituals and into really dark and evil behaviors. I don't claim to completely understand this book, but I will say it did really capture me. I just felt the atmosphere so much and it was interesting to see how Marlow reacted to it all and how it affected him. I was really struck by the following description of how he felt going back to civilization after so many months in the jungle and seeing the dark side of the human heart and almost dying from illness.""No, they did not bury me, though there is a period of time which I remember mistily, with a shuddering wonder, like a passage through some inconceivable world that had no hope in it and no desire. I found myself back in the sepulchral city resenting the sight of people hurrying through the streets to filch a little money from each other, to devour their infamous cookery, to gulp their unwholesome beer, to dream their insignificant and silly dreams. They trespassed upon my thoughts. They were intruders whose knowledge of life was to me an irritating pretense, because I felt so sure they could not possibly know the things I knew. Their bearing, which was simply the bearing of commonplace individuals going about their business in the assurance of perfect safety, was offensive to me like the outrageous flauntings of folly in the face of a danger it is unable to comprehend. I had no particular desire to enlighten them, but I had some difficulty in restraining myself from laughing in their faces so full of stupid importance.""It is a dark and somewhat strange little novel, but it's passages and insights like this one that make me really glad I read it. I did read it in high school and really didn't remember much of it other than the mood, so I'm glad I picked it up again, and I imagine it won't be the last time....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Apr 03, 2008","Mar 06, 2008",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1836885.Heart_of_Darkness

As I started reading it I thought it might just be a little too silly and I wasn't a big fan of the writing. It felt like the author was trying a little too hard. When she describes the ballroom she says, ""The walls were an impatient green, the crystals on the chandeliers winked in the window light. If she were the type of person who looked for signs, Jane would have thought the room was shivering in anticipation of something momentous. But she wasn't."" Impatient green? What does that even mean? I also felt like the author was just being a little self-indulgent and living out her own fantasies. I pushed through, though, and actually got drawn into the story and I really enjoyed some of the scenes. It was kind of a cute romance, somewhat predictable although I did miss one twist that surprised me. It was fun seeing the parallels with the Jane Austen novels.

This book is basically an account of the author about a year that her family spent trying to obtain their food from as close to their home as possible, much of it from their own land. There is a growing movement to ""eat local,"" and I'm sure she had a big hand in spreading that movement. Some of the reasons are supporting local farmers, understanding where your food comes from, having fresher and thus more nutritious foods, and more. One of the biggest reasons is the environmental impact. It takes a whole lot of fuel to truck and fly food all across the country and world, but I won't get into all that. I will say that her story was really interesting to me. Maybe it doesn't sound like you could fill a book talking about this, but she does and it never got boring. In fact I couldn't get enough. I almost wanted to go buy a big farm and raise chickens and turkeys and a huge garden, but the amount of work involved and the knowledge required is a little too intimidating. I would totally love to go stay on one for awhile and help and be a part of that lifestyle, though. I have also starting planting my garden for this summer and it is way more than I did last year and hopefully not more than I can handle! I learned so many interesting things. My only disappointment was that I had been hoping to hear at the end of the year if their eating had affected their health. I assume that eating all that fresh, local, organic, non-processed food would be really good for you, but she doesn't go into that. I guess they must have been healthy before and not really noticed any difference, but I thought that would be interesting to hear. Overall this was an interesting, educational, entertaining, inspiring, and well-written story. I'll end with a favorite quote from the book that I really identified with.""I share with almost every adult I know this crazy quilt of optimism and worries, feeling locked into certain habits but keen to change them in the right direction. And the tendency to feel like a jerk for falling short of absolute conversion. I'm not sure why. If a friend had a coronary scare and finally started exercising three days a week, who would hound him about the other four days? It's the worst of bad manners--and self-protection, I think, in a nervously cynical society--to ridicule the small gesture. These earnest efforts might just get us past the train-wreck of the daily news, or the anguish of standing behind a child, looking with her at the road ahead, searching out redemption where we can find it: recycling or carpooling or growing a garden or saving a species or  something.  Small, stepwise changes in personal habits aren't trivial. Ultimately they will, or won't, add up to having been the thing that mattered.""...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"May 24, 2008","Feb 24, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25460.Animal_Vegetable_Miracle

It was somewhat interesting, but not as much as I thought it would be and I ended up deciding to give up on it. One thing he spent a lot of time talking about was musical hallucinations, where you hear music in your head but it is as if you are actually hearing it. That actually happened to me one time as a teenager. I was alone in the car driving and I heard the entire song of ""With or Without You"" by U2. I checked the radio, which was turned off. I tried figuring out where it was coming from and finally realized it must be in my head, though I could actually hear it as though it were from an outside source. There were quite a few stories like that, so now at least I know I wasn't crazy. I'm just glad it only happened once!

I requested it from the library quite awhile back and it finally came in. I got it two days ago and have already read the whole thing. I care about food, nutrition, health, and the environment so this book interested me on many different levels. It really inspired me to eat more ""real"" foods and to try and increase the variety of produce and plant foods I eat, as well as to obtain my food from local sources as much as possible. I started doing that last year by participating in a CSA program with a local farm, but this has made me even more committed to that idea. The education on how detrimental the food industry and government programs have actually been on our health was really eye-opening and kind of scary. The book had a lot of really good guidelines to keep in mind to help make decisions about what to eat, without limiting it to specific kinds of diets or foods. I thought that broad approach was really helpful and interesting. It's not a diet book, but more a book about our attitudes about food and the way we eat and how that affects both our bodies and our world, especially the dramatic way that our eating habits have changed in the last century or so and what that consequences of that have been. Highly recommended! ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Mar 10, 2008","Feb 24, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/315425.In_Defense_of_Food
