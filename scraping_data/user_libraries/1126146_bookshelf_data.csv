I appreciated Berg’s appreciation for the old and elderly, given my personal aversion and fear of age and aging. It was comforting to be able to see it from another, more tender perspective.Berg’s ability to conjure up a whole lifetime in a few sentences or paragraph of the small details and quirks is so skilled and precise that it’s breathtaking and almost painful. So many lives, connected by only the thread of Having Lived, and all the specifics and peculiarities that entails. The spiritual, semi-supernatural element in this book adds a layer of mysticism and the feeling of the eternal, the universal, the oddly soothing feeling of being a speck of sand, a tiny star in the vast universe.Maybe it’s also a bit simplistic, one-dimensional (dare I say....saccharine?) in its “LOVE LOVE LOVE” approach, but I can accept and value that as a balm and salve for the harsh realities of life, where it’s more likely that the Arthur’s and Maddy’s and Lucille’s don’t ever find and complete each other, filling in the holes in each other lives as best they can. Or if they do, their collective issues, insecurities and needs would make it infinitely more difficult to achieve the note-slipping-under-doors harmony that the characters in the book do. It seems a bit naive to think that Maddy having a child at 18 and attending college as a single mother would be as easy as the book portrays it. It’s also pretty unbelievable how the book hints at the reconciliation between Maddy and her father after a childhood of neglect and emotional withholding, just because she’s left the house and had a baby, without any indication that her father has done any of the internal work or communication necessary for such a big shift.But did I buy the two other books in the trilogy immediately upon finishing this one?

The writing also felt a bit dated at times, which isn't surprising, as it IS dated. Also, Hogg's suggested 1.5 hours wake time and four daily naps is a bit ambitious.

That was….weird.Also, Eleanor Flood is not nearly as sympathetic or likeable as Bernadette. Maybe because we were in her head too much? Maybe I would've felt the same about Bernadette if she'd narrated more of ""Where'd You Go Bernadette?"" from a first person perspective? Regardless, Eleanor comes off as completely self-absorbed and out-of-touch. Hard to root for.Timby is supposed to be 11 years old, but Semple writes him like a much younger kid so that also confused and annoyed me.

This is interesting to , on the heels of my last book/ (The Light Between Oceans), in which I criticized its absolute depressingness-without-hope-or-redemption. And indeed, a lot of s here mention the book’s devotion to misery and the inevitable tragedy of life, with our insurmountable inability to understand each other. Nobody in the book is remotely happy or well-adjusted, long before the 16 year old middle daughter dies (which is really just the unfortunate consequence and culmination of everyone’s unhappy maladjustedness).Clearly, this book could be accused of the same, with its tragic beginning and tragic ending, its big and small heartbreaks, its forever misunderstood and overlooked cast of characters. So what’s the difference then? This book - while not really 'enjoyable' or a reading experience I'd want to repeat - ultimately gave me much more relatable food-for-thought, as it explored family, gender and racial dynamics, and all the fears and insecurities that embed themselves in our core as a result. All of our prescribed limitations. It reminded me the danger of secrets and thoughts left unspoken, how hurt feelings grow into deep insecurities that cause pain for everyone around us.One goodreads  finds fault with how the ending seems to absolve everyone from guilt, which surprised me to read, as I thought the whole book was a slow build to the reveal that everyone played a hand in her death, even the youngest, who couldn’t find a voice in all her invisibility.I appreciated the way Ng handles the ending, both satisfying readers by unveiling the mysterious events of Lydia’s last night alive, while preserving its authenticity by refraining from introducing some deus ex machina that tidies everything up and delivers answers wrapped in a bow to the stunned, grieving family. No, they’ll never know for sure what happened that night, why they lost their precious daughter and sister, as neither life nor death ever leaves neat answers. But damn right the reader gets to, or the book would’ve felt far too unfinished and unsatisfying. I wish I could get the perspective and awareness/consciousness of my own life that a narrator could reveal/provide, especially one as observant and insightful as Ng. I feel like if she could write my life story as it’s played out thus far, I’d be able to make some sense of it and figure out what my happy ending is supposed to be. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Apr 24, 2016","May 12, 2016",,Audible Audio,view (with text),/book/show/23433237-everything-i-never-told-you

Ultimately, I was disappointed in Mathilde's half of the story. What'd she do with her life after Lotto? Groff tries to make a case for a complete, compelling and fulfilling life for Mathilde separate from and after Lotto, and yet it fell short, with Mathilde's narrative instead reduced to revolving around Lotto as central character.I was also pretty impatient to get to Mathilde's side of the story, which might be why I was so disappointed in it. I was hoping it would redeem or complement Lotto's half, which went on way too long and could use some more editing - and just got so annoying and grating after a while. Such an insufferably self-absorbed - however well-meaning - man.Groff does rather have a way with words though, making them dance together in unexpected and beautiful harmony (""Lotto swam up out of the crowd and crossed the floor to Mathilde. She was six feet tall in bobby socks. In heels, her eyes were at his lip line. She looked up at him coolly. Already he loved the laugh she held in her, which nobody else would see."")I also appreciated the feeling of timelessness in this book. Even though Groff listed birth years to ground the story in history, there was a surprising (and rare these days) absence of cultural signifiers and references. Politics, music, pop culture, technology, social media, all refreshingly absent.My favorite part of this book was that it did very pointedly capture the inherent, basic problem/nature of gender inequality: men are born into the privilege of being benevolent, loving, innocent and feeling omnipotent, able to accomplish, achieve, have, deserving of anything/anyone. Women are born, bred and brought up with self-doubt and self-hatred.Both genders equally deserving of equal love, but men overdo it, and women underdo it....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jan 30, 2016","Feb 07, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/24612118-fates-and-furies

A whole .5 star has been added into this rating, just out of nostalgia, as homage for the books of my childhood. But this book didn’t deliver (reminding me yet again that low expectations are the key to life success and happiness). Admittedly, reading the large print edition (by accident) didn’t help. There was also an odd formatting choice to incorporate randomly bolded words that may/may not have been exclusive to this large print edition, but definitely sucked either way. I found it highly distracting.Essentially, this book ended up being just a typical Judy Blume special - a girl's coming-of-age story - but dressed up with a LOT of accoutrements that tried to force this story into a more grownup/adult framework. You know, like falling planes, dead bodies, etc... the real serious shit that grown up life is all about. But the heart and soul of it, where it shone and rang the most true, was the insight into adolescence, that bittersweet and confusing period of time that make or break a lot of people. Blume can still bring us inside the adolescent mindframe/perspective with such natural ease, which she’s not as adept at with the adult perspective. It was compelling and fascinating to watch Miri age and come of age. Her perspective/thoughts change and mature drastically from the beginning to the end of the book in a very real, organic way.As many have complained, the roster of characters is huge. But that’s not the main issue, it’s that so many on this roster seemed superficial, one-dimensional and therefore superfluous. Why did Blume feel a need to write the 1-2 chapters from Leah’s perspective? She sounded so off/sketchy and raised all sorts of weird red flags that were never revisited or resolved. And what’d the random Mike Monsky chapter bring to the party?? (And what's that backstory Blume alluded to, about Mike Monsky being Frekki's 'long-lost' brother!? How she’d find him?? How she’d lose him to begin with?!? How distracting!)So then in addition to the huge cast of characters, so much STUFF happens. Planes crash, kids die, first loves, coming of age, meeting your father for the first time, ghostly possession, etc. Each of these things, individually, could be the basis of an entire book on its own, so it was definitely way too much to cram all these events into one. LIKES:I did find it interesting how the Osners seemed to be the most affected long term as a family by the crashes - their marriage disintegrates, Natalie loses her mind, as does Steve. (Now that I know what I’m in for, and can adjust my expectations accordingly, I could be persuaded to read a follow up book focusing on the Osners.)I also appreciated the whole 'be careful of what you wish for' aspect in terms of Dr. O becoming Miri's dad etc, although again it felt a bit young/easy/simple and almost allegorical. Or pedantic.DISLIKES:The newspaper clippings/articles at the beginning of the chapters often seemed random - obviously not the ones about the plane crash that Henry wrote, but many of the others that didn't add anything to the story and no discernible theme/connection/underlying thread otherwise either.Inconsistent editing/formatting - that one chapter - section? - 15 I think, where Blume switched randomly from character POV to some third-party perspective organized/titled randomly by subject.

Some of the female characters felt much more well-defined (Sylvie is so strong and self-assured; I loved her until she just got to be too much - too acerbic, too mean and not redeeming enough) but still ultimately pointless because I couldn’t tell what the ‘point’ or arc of the plot was, even long after I’ve finished it. (Is it even linear or endlessly cyclical…?!)- I had some difficulty feeling/seeing Ursula’s personality because it stayed grounded so firmly in her first person narrative/perspective/POV that her persona from an outside-in perspective (as others would have perceive it) was never fully conveyed. In a few of the later chapters (like the one where she’s much older and living on her own), her character seems a little more clearly defined, maybe because she’s no longer surrounded by her large family and vying for the spotlight with its many members.THE STORYTELLING- There were a lot of details throughout the plot that were distracting in that I was constantly on the lookout for the wrap-up/resolution. And given the many many re-tellings and resulting variables, it was difficult to keep track of all the loose ends and whether they were all resolved. For example, I don’t remember ever revisiting the mystery of the dead body of the little girl they’d found (and named “Angela” I think), although other ladies in my book club did. And of course, why did Atkinson throw in that oblique and implied reference to Sylvie having an affair and then never reference it again?!- The device of using parentheses to insert dialogue was at first fun and amusing, e.g. “('Well, if one can’t take a lover in Italy, where can one take one?'

As if some editor had said to her “We need more dialogue in there!” and so she went back throughout the manuscript and threw in parentheses filled with one-liners wherever she could.THE CONCEPT…wtf? What was it ABOUT? For reals, what’s Atkinson trying to say? Was she just introducing us to Ursula, who has these special powers and insight? Or does Ursula represent a more sensitive version of all of us, and we all live these infinitely numerous, cyclical lives?

That’s my overall reaction and response to this book a few weeks after having finished it. I don’t mind twists and being surprised by them in my reading. You might even say I kind of enjoy them. But when the twist seems to be the main shtick propping up a piece of writing, well, then yes I’ve got issues with that. Then, as a final salt-in-wound-rub, post-reading, as I’m prepping my Goodreads  by reading how others felt and comparing notes, I have to read all these annoying coy non-s, with all these sideway insinuations and quotation marks around “the twist.” So while I enjoyed it a bit more during the experience than my rating might indicate, the Twist-That-Shall-Not-Be-Named hijacks the whole thing by the time the book is done and this take specifically does not add anything fresh or new to the whole genre.It was quite a slow build at the beginning and leading up to the big reveal, especially with an additional fake-out twist built in right before the big one. (I think I would’ve found a story based on the first fake-out twist much more interesting.) As an avid Victorian fan, I enjoyed the tone and setting, but became quite impatient for it to settle and find itself. It was also quite nicely developing characters (especially James’, and Christopher’s somewhat) until the TTSNBN arrives and takes over. Afterwards, the book feels mostly like an action movie in its specific genre, and again, one that doesn’t seem especially new or interesting or fresh.I was glad when the book finally comes full circle with the priest/hideaway closet; that was very gratifying, as until it had been a loose thread that seemed sloppy, indulgent and random. And the last section of the book, when Arthur and Charlotte are traveling around looking for a cure, was well-written in that it felt like a realistic depiction of PTSD. But I’m irritated that it didn’t come to full resolution with Augustus Mould and Edmund Bier, and am concerned, especially with the ending ending, that it might be leaving a sequel/series door open.

Last star withheld because the writing was a bit bumpy/uneven and laggy in the middle.There was much that hit very close to home, in terms of issues that are often on my mind these days, e.g. mortality, meaning, destiny. author working out all the same existential issues that we all do, but that I’ve been really overtly struggling with lately, so it spoke to me.Currie develops deep, authentic characters and writes from these different perspectives amazingly well, believably and sympathetically. I love the tragic, heroic, long-suffering, self-sacrificing, Sisyphean father-hero, who is unexpectedly self-aware with a rich inner world. I missed Debbie’s/The Mom’s POV and wished we could’ve heard from her again, both during her messiest, drunkest stage, as well as after she’d cleaned up somewhat. The female characters (aka Amy) did not seem to be as complex. I also missed more of Rodney’s perspective, which I imagine would have been extremely difficult to pull off after his childhood mishap and recovery. I thoroughly enjoyed the device used to bring Rodney’s perspective to life in that one chapter by using the transcript with the therapist; both ingenious and effective.The countdown and second person perspective was a bit odd/distracting and gimmicky in the beginning; couldn’t accept not knowing who the narrator is for a little while into the book. But I was eventually able to get used to it. I also wished for something SOMETHING a bit more in the last few paragraphs; something more enlightening, heartening, spiritually satiating - but that can alternately be attributed to my recent state of mind (“WHAT’S THE FACKING ANSWER ALREADY??”).The author's use of a ‘second life’ is a very impressive trick/device that works unexpectedly well. I do wonder why he didn’t choose an alternate universe where he could have prevented Rodney’s young cocaine-related damage, as well as his dad’s cancer - and maybe even his mom’s alcoholism - in addition to not telling Amy about the Destroyer of Worlds. Couldn’t he have saved them all in his second life?___________quotes: “You could not be more correct. It does matter. All of it.”“Listen: Everything ends, and Everything matters.Everything matters not in spite of the end of you and all that you love, but because of it. Everything is all you’ve got - your wife’s lips, your daughter’s eyes, your brother’s heart, your father’s bones and your own grief - and after Everything is nothing. So you were wise to welcome Everything, the good and the bad alike, and cling to it all. Gather it in. Seek the meaning in sorrow and don’t ever ever turn away, not once, from here until the end. Because it is all the same, it is all unfathomable, and it is all infinitely preferable to the one dreadful alternative.”“I’m not saying I have no regrets. Who would believe anyone who said that? When someone claims to regret nothing I just assume that he and I have different definitions for the word, and lave it at that.”...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jul 19, 2014","Jul 19, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7642089-everything-matters

By the time I received it a day and a half later on Sunday (somehow - who delivers on Sundays?), I’d read all of Sugar’s columns online. Which meant that I'd spent most of my weekend bawling. This was not easy reading. It felled me, physically and spiritually, and I was bed bound for much of the weekend, as I tore through her columns.I then read the whole book, skimming all the columns and looking for the elusive ‘new material’ that hadn’t made its way to the online form, but never found it. Or maybe there was one or two pieces tucked in there somewhere, that wasn’t anywhere near as powerful as the ones that had been previously published online, but I didn’t notice it.I cried copiously throughout, each column piecing my heart, innards, psyche in beautiful and painful ways. This was not a typical 5 star rating for me, in that it’s not fiction and it’s a compilation, typically my most dreaded kind of book. And yet I know it is one that I will turn to many many times, one that will have to serve as my humanistic and atheistic bible. It will be a long time before I have gleaned all its beauty and wisdom. It is wondrous, in and of itself proof that we can ascend and be better than we appear. We can reach. We should always choose love.There are many that consider Dear Sugar to be too personal, more of a memoir than an advice column.But I think really what Sugar’s writing does is make use of an inherent truth of advice columns and why they continue to exist, and why we continue to write to strangers - and even why the Internet is made to support things like advice columns: other people’s problems are always easier to solve. The objectivity achieved when considering another's issue makes all the difference in discerning what a good, reasonable next step forward might be. That’s why Sugar’s personal stories are both relevant and helpful - it helps the letter writers achieve a bit of that needed distance and objectivity to relate to a situation that might seem different, yet is exactly the same, as theirs.Her deep, raw empathy takes my breathe away. As many have noted, Dear Sugar was not an advice column. It transcended beyond, to a collection of human prayers, presented through Strayed’s soulful, mournful, hopeful, relentless compassion. If Dear Sugar could be a religion, I would be a disciple....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jun 09, 2014","Jun 09, 2014",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/13152194-tiny-beautiful-things

(Both of which is not an ideal situation to deal with on a Kindle because you can't just flip back and forth to pick up the thread.)I found the first third of the book to be pretty uneven and written a bit disjointedly, with bits of magical realism stuck on haphazardly and not well/seamlessly interwoven.About a third of the way into the book, I got much more interested in the story when it seemed to have finally settled into the recognizable shape/rhythm of a murder mystery. That lasted a few pages and the story turned/shifted again, a bit abruptly, to then focus on eugenics and issues of race and inequality.

I’m not an antiques enthusiast or any sort of collector, and I tend to find “tchotchkes” a waste of money that just creates more dust in the house and fosters unnecessary materialism. While reading this book doesn’t really change that perspective, in that I’m no more inclined to start collecting or learning about antiques, I found Theo’s passion and respect for these beautiful things and the everlastingness of objects both touching and compelling. ""What death doesn't touch."" I’ve never thought of objects in this light, nor considered their immortality. And of course, the characters in this book! Oh, the characters. Of course, I very much loved both Boris and Hobie, as I was supposed to. They're polar opposites representing Theo’s conflict and struggle with himself, his demons and angels, the light and the dark sides of the Force. The story is at its best/most interesting when Boris is around, with his complicated morals and ethics. ""It's never the way it seems. All good, all bad. So much easier if it was,"" he says. Which leads Theo to ponder: ""What if our badness and mistakes are the very thing that set our fate and bring us round to good? What if, for some of us, we can't get there any other way?"" So thought-provoking - and Hobie essentially says the same thing about good coming from unexpected places. I did appreciate that there wasn’t a happily-ever-after ending with Pippa; I was bracing myself for it and am grateful to Tartt that she didn’t give into that temptation. I do wish Kitsy could’ve been a touch more dimensional and real. She didn’t have to be so only evil and repulsive.I also found it weird in a distracting and confusing way that I couldn't put my finger on the time period in which these events took place, especially at the beginning of the story, when the stage is being set. I get that this world is more of an alternate universe, where the museum is blown up in some unspecified act of presumed terrorism, but I assume Tartt wanted the rest of the story to feel like ‘reality’ and there were just too many instances that didn’t feel right. I thought the story started in a post-9/11 world because someone mentions Osama…but 9/11 doesn’t occur until much later on. There was texting, but then someone looks something up in the yellow pages. Facebook is mentioned later on in the story, as is the Harry Potter franchise, but that just seems to emphasize the obvious technology-shaped holes, like Theo getting printed newspapers in Amsterdam for the news and not using Google translate to try to understand them....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"May 30, 2016","Mar 26, 2014",,Audiobook,view (with text),/book/show/18266071-the-goldfinch

It sounds like this is a rare feat for most readers, as most tend to read a  beforehand. (Of course, this raises the question of why I purchased this book if I did not read any s beforehand. This remains a hole in my memory.) I was extremely lucky to experience this twist with all its accompany surprise and shock.  Fowler – and/or Rosie (which is SUCH an unlikely name for the very un-cheery protagonist...I kept forgetting that was her name) – is a great storyteller, unfolding her story leisurely and at her chosen pace, making you wait impatiently for the backstory behind the missing siblings. The anticipation builds up nicely and with some tension as Rosie set the stage for the main event – her sister’s disappearance, and of course, her sister in general. Rosie is dry, sarcastic and sharply funny as she tells ‘the middle’ of her story (it is interesting how much her tonality changes by the end of the book). The explorations of the beginning, middle and end of stories was a compelling device or layer to the telling of the story itself.  Immediately upon the great reveal, I had to pause and take a step back and reassess. It was subsequently very interesting to observe how my own reaction to the story changed as soon as I learned the truth about Fern. 'Oh!' I remember thinking 'this isn't a tragedy. It's a comedy. Or at least an absurdist-y.'I, with my deep love for furry animals.That was interesting and telling.Once I got over the absurdity of Fern as monkey sister, the depth and harshness of her betrayal and abandonment was searing.  While I found this book to be a compelling, fascinating, probing and thought-provoking read overall, it may have suffered a bit (one star's worth) from trying to accomplish too many different things. Any one of the many topics - stories, families and the permanent imprints they leave on us, childhood traumas/demons, memory and its fluid/chimerical nature, humankind's subjugation of this world in the name of scientific progress - would have been enough for the sole focus of a book; Fowler attempted to tackle all of these and more and it made for a fragmented story, or one that felt like it may have swerved somewhat along the way. While all of her points were interesting explorations, there were just too many of them to ponder and process. Random collection of observations:-	This story was a very extreme example of how we are all products of our childhoods/upbringings and how it shapes who we are – and also how necessary it is to confront our traumas in order to develop fully as adults. Rosie’s arc/development is her eventually embracing her inner monkey girl and allowing that to guide her strengths, although it did leave a bit of a gap between the middle and the end of the story – I wanted to know what happened with Rosie in all the intervening years.-	Such an ultimately sad sad book. The ending was filled with so much melancholy and loneliness. Not just for the individual characters, but for the human race and the non-humans we co-habitate the earth with. -	The book was a bit too ‘neat’ and pat in the depiction of Rosie diving into her past and carefully examining her memories for cracks, like her memory is some tangible, solid thing, a piece of pottery she can run her hands over.-	The large, weighty debate behind the ethics of animal experimentation obviously loomed throughout. ""Nobody's arguing these issues are easy"" Rosie states - if it were easy, there wouldn't be an issue. If animal experimentation didn't result in scientific and medical advancements, its popularity would've died out a long time ago. That’s a hard one to process. Human advancement is contingent upon other species’ subjugation. It continues to be a hard lesson for me, as an animal lover, that the best thing us humans can do for the things we love - like animals - is to please leave them the fack alone. Humans, with our destructive inclination to devour and consume as our driving force, just don't know how to show love otherwise....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Dec 11, 2013","Dec 28, 2013",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/18045340-we-are-all-completely-beside-ourselves

You plague my thoughts, you terrorize my nights, you dominate my fear. And of course, you are the inevitable conclusion to my life, the period at the end of my sentence, thereby exacerbating the importance (or lack thereof) of every step I take on the march there. Why stop there? Why wouldn't you also claim whatever treasured novel I happen to be reading at this vulnerable point in my life, as I look for escape and reprieve, only to be reminded and taunted that there is none? Fack you, @sshole.Death does not wait long to announce its presence in B&B. William Bellman deals with it even less capably and healthily than I do, in fact in the opposite manner - I obsess while he denies and flees. (I suppose it is debatable which coping mechanism is more or less healthy. I would welcome and relish the ability to deny and flee at this point.)Some s on this esteemed site adamantly avow that fans of The Thirteenth Tale would not appreciate or enjoy Setterfield's second book whatsoever. I disagree with this sentiment, as I thoroughly enjoyed both The Thirteenth Tale and this book - until the ending anyway, as it was a complete anticlimactic letdown.The letter accompanying my Advanced Reader's Copy talks about the 'rather strange bargain' that Bellman strikes with an 'even stranger partner,' as well as the 'one small cruel act that has unforeseen and terrible consequences.' Neither the bargain nor the terrible consequences were apparent in my reading, therefore the bewildering unsatisfying ending. As far as I can decipher, Bellman refuses to contemplate humanity's mortality even when confronted with its actuality, instead diving into his business and work. And then, at the precipice of his own death, Black appears and forces him to ""Remember!"" which then Bellman finally does and marvels at the life he has led. And then Bellman dies. The end.Huh?Black seems unaware of the bargain that Bellman believes was made. Presumably, Bellman would've died regardless of whether or not he'd killed the rook in his youth, regardless of how he lived his life afterwards, just, regardless. It seems, maybe, that because of the rook murder, he was forced to recall the entirety of his life, and especially that singular event, right before his death, I think? Which does not really seem like a very dire consequence in and of itself. If Setterfield is implying that Bellman suffered his family's deaths because of the rook killing, she did not imply that loudly enough.Despite the frustrating ending though, the book was extremely interesting, enjoyable and compelling to read. Setterfield is a talented, skilled writer and her Victorian affections are apparent and very endearing. The amount of research she must have conducted to bring to life the language and workings of this time - especially how well she understands the business of mills/textile production - is impressive. Setterfield also has the ability to sketch characters in just a few short sentences, and simply lay bare the heart of a character and his motivations (yes ""his"" specifically - except for the daughter, the more-explored characters are all male - I could've used more development of Bellman's wife - oh and I wish Bellman's deserting father was a story plot revisited and resolved). Bellman's sharp personality shift from always-happy to all-serious/business after his family tragedy felt real and heart-stirring.But it all leads to not much at all, and definitely not enough. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Nov 23, 2013","Nov 24, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17571907-bellman-black

I guess part of the star rating is also because Shteyngart does capture the essence of places well, from NYC to St. Petersburg....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Oct 11, 2013","Oct 12, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/70509.Absurdistan

Anything 'sexy' is implied and referred to indirectly/obliquely. Franny's mother's death is portrayed in more of a long-ago, hazy, fairy tale-ish way than a real tragic event.

How can one be a mother in that country? It's mind-boggling.The other 'smaller' stuff is also beautifully and painstakingly captured here; relationships between friends, lovers, family members.The plot proceeds sporadically, in uneven spurts, dilly dallying in parts with whole pages of streams of consciousness, then the next page skipping days or years. Once I got used to this, it was quite beautiful and compelling, and I enjoyed how the backstory unfolded, naturally along with the current story rather than in forced flashbacks.Grossman writes beautifully, deeply and densely. As the rare male author writing from the POV of a female protagonist (and a mother no less - the ultimate test of female protagonism - and in a household of men!), he achieves remarkable success, understanding completely the fierce, protective maternal instinct, the female insecurity and self-doubt. These characters are whole and complex, even ever-absent Ilan, as deep in emotion and thought as one can only hope all people are.Not much happens, plot-wise, in the present of the story. Ora relinquishes her son back to war, deeply bruising her relationship with the family driver in the process, starts panicking at the thought of her son's death and being notified of it, and starts a long walk/journey as a superstitious way to prolong, escape, protect. She brings a old hurt friend Avram with her, who undergoes the most change during the course of this present. Along the way, their backstory, which contains all the action and events, unfolds naturally and painfully.Some parts that are never fully explained, like Ilan's complete side of the story, or when Ora and Ilan started dating and why (as Ilan seems most assuredly gay - and that's another unexplained mystery, why Ilan remains so detached), but these even are swallowable, as one of life's many unexplained mysteries. Plus, these are not the point. Some unanswered questions loom post-reading - does Ofer live? Did Ora pull a slip of paper from the hat truly unknowingly, or did she make a purposeful choice? What happens next - does she stay with Avram? Does Ilan return and do they reconcile? Does Avram have a daughter? When will Adam forgive Ora? These questions are definitely the point, as are the way the unansweredness haunts the reader.So many thoughts occur after finishing this book, beyond the bigger sadnesses of the author's son and his reality, beyond Israel and war, all of which are still to much to reconcile and comprehend. Was Ora hoping to get Avram's forgiveness of Ofer's forgetful, shameful act as a soldier? Was Ofer sacrificially volunteering for this last campaign as penance? Did Ora's fear and conviction of Ofer's death come from her belief that he deserved it, because of what he had - or had not - done, in letting the old man stay in the meat locker? Or did Ofer volunteer simple as a retaliation against his mom for not having supported him wholly during that period of time, for her questions? Of course, Ora's family cannot help but take her question ""how could he forget...?"" personally, when really what she is asking is, ""what did they do to my boy that he could forget?""...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Aug 07, 2013","Aug 11, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7779571-to-the-end-of-the-land

Walter also writes very beautifully and movingly, painting believable, full portraits of characters and settings. I couldn't put it down.But. There were a few parts of the thread/timeline that felt less purposeful or essential to the story and I couldn't quite figure out why Walter felt the need to include them, e.g. Dee and Pat when the latter was an adolescent - is it just to highlight her difficulties with him? Is Walter trying to emphasize 'look at the hard life she lived!' Why don't we get the same peek at Pasquale's in-between life?

It was like this book was written to directly address all my issues with the second. Namely, the holier-than-thou Patryns/Sartans and Haplo's predictability (his end report to his Lord blew me away - all in or all out eh?!?).It was also a fascinating and dark exploration of Death, and its role in Life. Even as someone with major issues accepting Death (who would gladly become a vampire to avoid it - I've got it figured out, I'd prey on animals), I shuddered to imagine the zombie/ghost-like post-life existence depicted in this world. First time I've acknowledged a fate worse than death....I couldn't quite follow the details/logic of some of the storyline (not sure I understood what happened in the secret chamber, nor what Jonathan's revelation was that even Alfred could not grasp) and the detailed historical/scientific studies at the very end of the book didn't quite help - if lazars were discovered at the beginning of necromancy studies, why didn't this divert/quell necromantic goals?

I know they'll return in some future book, but still. Haplo's somewhat intriguing, but not quite compelling enough on his own - and I feel I can kind of predict where his character arc's going. Also, being a mensch myself, I am much more interested in the mensch characters. Haplo's insufferably smug and self-satisfied. I find I have little patience for the Patryns or the Sartans, with their inflated, superior sense of selves as demi-gods, just because they have powerful magical abilities. They look down on the mensch and their violet warring ways - and yet clearly, the Patryns/Sartans have not learned how to co-exist peacefully either.

I only meant to read this book for a few paragraphs and get a feel for it before committing to it as my next book (given my aversion to short stories and collections thereof) but I never stood a chance. I was hooked immediately.When you read Diaz, it doesn't even feel like reading. His words wash over you like he's in the room telling you his story and you just can't stop listening, even if you know how it will inevitably end, even when you want to roll your eyes and say “no duh you jackass” and maybe slap some sense into him. Diaz’s trick is that you feel like he’s one of your oldest friends – maybe not one that you’d introduce to your sister to, but one that you root for and sympathize with nonetheless, almost involuntarily.His prose is lyrical, intimate and personal – especially with his use of the second person ""you."" I found this to be generally effective, although it could also be hard to track at times (especially when he occasionally lets slip an “I” or “me”). His style of writing also makes it difficult to separate the author from the protagonist.The lone chapter from a female’s (non-Yunior) perspective threw me.

I finished it sitting on my cold, hard kitchen floor, hunched and curled up over my phone because I couldn’t stop reading it long enough to move anywhere – “I’m at 92%!!” I shouted over to Tom, “We can leave in 20 minutes!!” The book completely unnerved me and I sobbed for five minutes after I'd finished it (so, yes the 20 minute ETD was protracted, which, admittedly, Tom expected, as he does know me). I was unprepared for its rawness.It took several chapters in the beginning to set the stage and introduce the cast of characters. I was right at my saturation point and patience limit when the last character is introduced and the story takes off. Rowling is able to develop each character so well and fully – all of them are rich, deep, complicated, real – even the dead man is brought back to life vividly, especially through the lens of multiple perspectives. Anytime she returned us to the Price household, I immediately tensed up in anticipation of Simon's psychopathy which, accompanied with his blazing hot temper, often resulted in fiery displays of violence and aggression. He scared me and living in his son Andrew's shoes was not enjoyable; it was a viscerally uncomfortable experience. It’s a feat that Rowling is able to convey and instill such empathy. Once the plot picks up, it builds up momentum smoothly and quickly, so that by the last quarter of the book, every event feels like The Event, until I’m holding my breath thinking ‘can more sh1t even happen??!!’ In the grand finale, every plot device gets connected, tied up in a bow with purpose, meaning and fate (the computer in the river!) and it was mind-blowing when I finally saw - far too belatedly - all the pieces click into place and the bigger picture show itself. I realized I was reading an absolutely terrifying, harrowing story, all that much more so because it was so unexpected.I couldn’t compose myself immediately afterwards because of the painful, piercing understanding the book made me confront that each and every one of us – with our stubborn, petty, close-minded, determinedly self-absorbed lives – inevitably contributes to the bigger tragedy of life, even if we never know or acknowledge the role or responsibility. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jul 14, 2013","Oct 05, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13497818-the-casual-vacancy

But, it was nowhere as good, which I should have expected. This was choppier and more uneven/inconsistent than I'm used to from Irving, and his storytelling skill is not nearly as good/compelling as it becomes.Irving obviously naturally gravitates towards flawed, quirky characters, but in this book had not yet quite honed his ability to make them whole and human. The constant unpredictable changes in POVs were somewhat annoying and distracting, as was his habit of referring to the main character by various nicknames, often in the same sentence. I imagine this was purposeful and intended to emphasize Trumper's lack of depth, identity, purpose etc, but it didn't really work, generally detracting from rather than adding to the story.As always with Irving, childhood abandonment is a key theme (poor Irving!), and fathers that leave, although I'm more used to the actual fathers being absent from his books, rather than having the story told from the father's perspective. It is hard to be on this father's side, as it's obvious Irving hasn't quite achieved an understanding of the absent father's motivations, which is reinforced by the whole cast of characters saying things to Trumper like ""You just leave! You don't even know why!"" and Trumper conceding that, yes yes, they are all right. He just leaves. He doesn't know why.And he (Irving and/or Trumper) never really addresses that, never figures out why Trumper leaves with such frequency, which is largely why the ending feels too forced, abrupt and pat, neatly tied up with a ribbon. It was unsatisfying, as Trumper doesn't have to deal with any real consequences of his actions, and his character arc feels unprompted and unbelievable. He just seems to have this random moment of ""this is what I'm going to do!"" and so he does it (also completely out of character) for no good reason, and then he repents his errant ways and lives happily ever after.

I also really appreciated the story's refusal to automatically include some sort of romantic subplot or interlude for Taylor, something I feel many authors would default to as part of the story and it was refreshing that this one didn't - and didn't need to, as it was already chock full of characters. On the other hand, it's not as if it was in any way unbelievable - because any female coming into her own would be exploring her romantic feelings - but this is also addressed because Taylor does have romantic feelings...the story just doesn't compromise its integrity by devolving to a silly rom-com where Taylor lives happily ever after just because she's the protagonist.

So touching and beautifully written, with a searingly insightful understanding of the family dynamic, the pain and beauty at its core that shapes who are. It was so dead-on with its portrayal of the impact fraught family relationships have on all of us. I'm withholding the last half star only because I wasn't quite fully satisfied with the ending, and didn't understand how/why it would be Nina's chosen ending.Miller writes like a better, kinder version of Jonathan Franzen. One that's a little less cynical, more beautiful, sympathetic and appreciative of life:""I wept for a long time in her office. I wept because I felt so confused by life - I was eighteen - and its strange mixture of beauty and ugliness. Because I was frightened at the idea of giving up what I felt was all I had inside of me - my rage at my family, my pain. Because I saw that therapy, the terrible cure my father had forced on me, had brought me to this moment, the moment I thought I was evading even as I began to tell the story that contained it. I wept because it had released me and helped me in a way I never would have chosen, hadn't in fact consented to.""I liked that the story is told and explored through the various points-of-view of different family members but am not quite sure get why the perspective sometimes changed from third to first, specifically when the story returns to Nina's POV (but still alternating between a first/third person perspective within her POV). While I'm sure it was intentional and purposeful, I couldn't figure out why and what it was adding, and therefore found it a bit random and distracting.I loved how the book treated Randall. While he was inevitably, irrevocably at the center/core of the story and established family dynamic, he himself is this vague, undefined character, without personality or specificity. It felt heartbreakingly real, that the family could revolve so resolutely around someone who is so 'not there.'And this, I suppose, is the power and impact that Miller's (and Franzen's) familial exploration imparts: it reminds us of all the ways that our love can inflict pain and sorrow every day, through the smallest and slightest of actions and words, on all those forced to share our days in close proximity and circumstance....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Apr 16, 2012","Apr 17, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/409991.Family_Pictures

She did such a natural, convincing job with it that you could feel the jolt in the side-by-side comparison when her narrative returned to the present time and culture, like when the actress playing Grace asks whether she should play that one scene with a touch of annoyance because no one's noticed/thanked her. And by that point in the story, the reader already knows how to answer, as Grace does, that no, in those times, being successful in service means to go completely unnoticed, to blend into the background.I did find it interesting that Grace and Robbie Hunter were essentially from the same situation, but Robbie, being a male and an heir, was offered such a different life/opportunity, despite it being one he disdained and scorned. While Grace had to work hard over a lifetime to pull herself up out of her service background, Robbie died (albeit tragically) young as a famous, romanticized poet.With the story so focused on the Hartford sisters, I didn't feel Grace's character was very developed. There are hints throughout of her life and strong character which I didn't really get a sense of through her narrative and would've loved to read more about. The way Grace presented the timeline of events - and the characters - was also not very linear, which on one hand did make it interesting, but also a bit confusing and now I feel like I have to quickly re-read the whole thing to make sure I didn't miss anything.I didn't understand why the movie being made about the Riverton story gained any traction at all....without knowing Grace's secret, the twist, it doesn't seem like there's much there for a movie. Some random poet kills himself who's not even part of the Luxerton/Ashbury lineage. By that token, wouldn't Frederick's suspicious death have warranted a movie as well? Was it just because it happened during a big society party? I also didn't understand in certain parts how the story would've made it to film / the filmmaker....like the scene where Robbie comes to the rescue after Emmeline falls from the Christmas tree. The only ones who witnessed that event were the Hartford siblings, Robbie and Grace. The only one of them left alive during the film-making is Grace and clearly she didn't write or contribute to the script.I also very badly wanted to know whether Hannah ever figured out that Grace was her half-sister. It seemed like a superfluous plot point otherwise. It also seemed a bit unbelievable that Grace's mom or the Ashburys would want/allow Grace to return to their household, so that she can remind the family daily of Frederick's disgrace. It honestly does not seem beneficial for either side. If Grace's mom were the blackmailing type, she could've gotten a nice lump sum from the Ashburys when she was first banned from the household so that she wouldn't have to then suffer all those years of near-poverty. It seems odd and unlikely that she would decide fourteen years later to cash in her chips for a lowly service position for Grace, putting Grace into the exact same situation that got her mom into trouble to begin with.

And while I agree with a lot of other s that the draggy middle and somewhat unfulfilling/unresolved ending didn't deliver or measure up, I still couldn't put it down until I was finished. A large part of the immediate upfront appeal of the story was the juxtaposition of such a weird, eccentric and singular upbringing/environment against the age-old, universal, implacable, familiar truths of family (and Life!) dynamics - parental worship/disappointments/failures, aging, denials, unfulfilled dreams, illnesses, sibling rivalry, the struggle to support your family.Russell's writing and style awed me.

The Awful Thing that happens to the protagonist also sucked as a plot device, largely because it's unresolved. What I did find intriguing was that the story seems to take place in a not-quite-defined time period, which was both distracting/unsettling and yet timeless-feeling.

Misha does make Viktor much more human, literally and emotionally, as Viktor is at his best when he cares for Misha. Misha also counterbalances the presence of constant melancholy (although Misha himself is melancholic). He's a penguin! He's adorable! I'm doing a silent 'awwww' throughout the book, even sans pictures.Kurkov manages to write so smoothly that even the tenser plot devices (mafia/dark criminal figures, writing obits, Viktor realizing that his role in the whole ""scheme"" cannot be sustainable) did not make me anxious. (Which I guess could be a bad thing if Kukov was aiming for a nailbiter.) The whole story was very intriguing and Viktor, very engaging. He's relatable in an Everyday Man sort of way - especially in his reaction as he slowly, inevitably realizes his role in the larger scheme of things. That most especially - because we all play an unwelcome and unbidden role in the darker, bigger mechanisms of life and we can either embrace it and play it LOUDLY, or shrug and brace against it, as Viktor does, and play it as long as we can. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Oct 25, 2011","Oct 24, 2011",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/11125891-death-and-the-penguin

It was certainly a draining investment, but I thought worthwhile.Kind of weird, I'd rate each book 4 stars because they're all in such bad need of heavy editing (especially as this third book is as gratuitously porny as the first book), but the sum equals more than its parts and I think I'd rate the trilogy overall 5 stars in its astonishing breadth and epic-ness.While not as urgent, action-packed and nail-biting as the first two books (although there was certainly some of this this in the latter sections of the book), I did enjoy seeing Tatiana and Alexander weather all the ups and lows of their mostly atypical and sometimes-typical marriage. Perhaps never really exactly typical, because of their ridiculous, wondrous love for each other, but typical in the every day mundane pettiness, jealousies, misunderstandings that all relationships do weather, in the common rites of passage from parenting, to career choices, to the friends we choose.And let's be honest, this is a pretty crazy story Simons is asking that we buy. But the characters are both extraordinary/exceptional and convincing/dimensional - as is their love - and I bought it. Bought a world where this could be, should be possible.While the seemingly-random insertion of Tania's childhood stories was at first distracting and unappreciated (and also irrelevant - ummm....didn't we already watch ALL these characters die in the first book...?), it grew on me and became pointful (the opposite of pointless) by the last poignant story. It also helped sew together some earlier-alluded-to details, all the way back from the first novel (e.g. Tania's broken arm when her father returned from that fateful Poland business trip, bearing the gift of the white flowered dress) which seemed a praiseworthy feat, giving more depth and dimension to Tania's character and upbringing. The only character I liked more than young Tania is old Tania. Simons' depth of knowledge in so many different areas, like history, military, politics, baking, Arizona, etc. was also impressive. Although in some of these sections of the book, the heavy editing could've helped a bit and Simons did seem like she was just showing off.One slight irritation that was very distracting: the number of grandchildren at the end of the book don't add up right!

Nervously, urgently, breathlessly waiting through 91% of the book for the two to be reunited is a nerve-wracking experience, especially when a tiny tiny part of me wasn't entirely sure that it would happen. That was the good excruciating way. The bad excruciating was that there were definitely sections that needed more editing. There were so many parts that I guess were supposed to capture the characters' thoughts/thinking (or the author's or the reader's?? it's tough to tell) in a stream-of-consciousness way, but really was just a bunch of words strung together. Like the ending: ""Barrington, Leningrad, Luga, Ladoga, Lazarevo, Ellis Island, the mountains of Holy Cross, their lost families, their lost mothers and fathers, their brothers in arms and brothers are etched on their souls and their fine faces and like the mercurial moon, like Jupiter over Maui, like the Perseus galaxy with its blue, imploding stars they remain, as the stellar wind whispers over the rivers all run red, over the oceans and the seas, murmuring through the moonsilver skies..."" Not a complete sentence and not even a complete thought - it seems overly indulgent and sloppy as I'd say easily 35% of the book comprised of these type of passages.

Because obviously, I will therefore get the happy ending this tale deserves. (And the Goodreads synopsis of the third book confirms as much.) Otherwise it'd be way too Russian to enjoy.Tatiana annoyed me at the start of the story, as did the writing, both seeming immature and not well-defined. But by the end of the book, Tatiana has developed into such a strong, stubborn, compassionate, determined and willful character in such a convincing manner - I guess it's the best side affect of enduring and surviving war that one could hope for - that I fell for her. Alexander's character lacked that same arc, but he was pretty compelling nonetheless. Although his obsession and enthrallment with her virginity/innocence was pretty icky, annoying, hypocritical (given his implied slutty past) and, I thought, chauvinistic.At many points in the development of their relationship, these two are stalled by their pride and ego, which results in their misinterpretation of the other's actions. I thought this was a very realistic portrayal of adult relationships and communications - ""But you said this!"" ""But I really felt that!"" ""Well how am I supposed to know that?!!?"" ""Well maybe you should trust me!"" No winners, just losers, both sides being in the wrong - all so true.I also enjoyed the beautifully-painted cultural portrait of Russia during that time (is there really no Russian word for ""privacy?!"") and their attitudes and behavior as well; how acceptable it was for Tatiana to receive the verbal, emotional and sometimes physical abuse that she does from her family. While it was a little unbearable that she withstood it all, it helped that she was able to explain and defend it somewhat to the American foil, Alexander. No, I don't get it - but I won't because I didn't grow up in that time and culture. So I had to accept it and move on. I appreciate this completely alien point-of-view, because I read to expand my horizons and do not expect nor demand that literature always reflect my beliefs, lifestyle, culture. Simmons also chillingly portrays the paranoia that was the reality everyone had to live with to survive - near the end of the book, when Dr. Sayers tries to convince Alexander that all is not lost by saying ""I will call the American embassy tomorrow!"" and Alexander pretty much tsk-tsks and says ""I'll be gone by tomorrow.""The honeymoon was a little porny for me; its lengthy, detailed and repetitive descriptions of their many sexual encounters were worthy of a book with Fabio on the cover. I think I would've understood the depth of their passion and dedication without it. That these two quite literally loved the other more than him/herself, that they each felt it was more important for the other to live - that felt like inspirational, admirable, beautiful love.I will be reading the next two in the series post-haste!...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Sep 25, 2011","Sep 26, 2011",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/10849572-the-bronze-horseman

This was perfectly acceptable to me, as she's a complex and compelling character - stubborn, proud and headstrong as Brooks' female protagonists tend to be. And yet, admirably resourceful, independent and compassionate. I love Brooks' proficiency in showing you multiple, varied sides/aspects of a person's whole being and character, as she does with Bethia's brother, Makepeace. (Which, by the way, she never explained in terms of why/how Makepeace came to be with such a ""salvage""-sounding name.)I did find her Bethia-narrating-through-her-journal literary device somewhat inconsistent, to the point of distraction. There were many points were I paused and tried to figure out from what point in Bethia's life/journal she was writing from, and finding it disconcerting when I couldn't trace it.I also, at the end of it all, couldn't figure out - or justify - why Brooks chose to pick Caleb as the brave, commendable, estimable Indian protagonist. Joel seemed to be equally - if not more - worthy of the role, coming from a family/father that was outcast from his own tribe and seemingly having to overcome as many trials and tribulations as Caleb - only to rise to achieve the status of a Harvard valedictorian right before his untimely and tragic end.At first, I found the jump between the young woman and the old lady disconcerting - like she'd just skipped the most important part of the story.

I read in delicious anticipation hoping the book would allow me to witness at least one of two moments - when Fern returns to and reunites with Stavros, or when Fern and Fenno discover their other tenuous connection, Fenno's father, but for some reason was not too disappointed when the book ended before either happens. As I read, I couldn't help thinking that - and I know typically this would sound like an insult to a book, but I mean it as a compliment - this book would make a good movie....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jul 30, 2011","Jul 30, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/227593.Three_Junes

So my expectations, justifiably, lowered. And the first half of the book met my lowered expectations.

Or, you have to make your own HEA, with whatever bits and pieces of leftover happiness life allows you.I've gone back to read more of the Goodreads s in depth, and I am ridiculously annoyed by all the ""it's about a random date in their lives, over a span of 20 years"" comments, because clearly all these readers have missed the point, badly. It's NOT a random date. Yes it's the date they meet...but more than that, painfully more, it's the date she dies.

We are all more than our biggest, saddest tragedy or grief - even if it defines us for a period of time - and none of these characters had more than their sad story.I had a hard time believing some of the character portrayals and plot points. Why didn't anyone tell Mary upfront that Beth was suffering from cancer - before Mary felt fully annoyed and incapacitated by Beth's obnoxious, seemingly-perfect life?? How could Scarlet and Lulu be so unforgiving as to find Beth annoying, knowing that she was battling cancer?? And really, Mary's mother suffered the EXACT SAME tragedy as Mary and was unable to share that with her?!

The sole person she could've counted on to allay her fears and care for her as she became a recluse?

The Holly I knew up until that point continuously, regularly and reliably stopped by Mary's home - even when she refused to answer the door - to offer support, love and condolences in the form of funky-colored baked goods. From a knitting perspective, it also felt highly unlikely that Mary jumped from scarves and hats to knitting socks and sweaters in a matter of months. And unless the knitting circle sat and knit all day, it is very doubtful they could knit complete sweaters in one session.Overall, this book felt superficial and forced. Not terrible - because Hood still writes well, albeit inconsistently - but disappointing because I expected a lot more. I'm not sure at all what her ""point"" was.

Especially on the heels of a Kate Morton binge, where I reminded myself that ""all good authors are too distinct to avoid being formulaic,"" this book amazed me because it had nothing in common with the other two Egan books I've read (in order, Look At Me and A Visit from the Goon Squad) except for all the wonderful character development Egan is capable of. I liked this one best (and the first one least). My reasons: 1) delicious Gothic setting and overtones are just the thing for my Victorian/romantic sensibility, 2) Danny, as despicable and yucky he is, is also so reluctantly relatable with his disappointments and misplaced intentions, 3) CASTLES, 4) how the big loose ends are tied up and the little ones are left to intrigue with their mystery. Danny, as the antihero protagonist, doesn't seem to undergo a character arc - until he just changes, fakes his actions and pretends to be a leader, a hero...and that's what makes him one. He is an unwitting, poignant demonstration of kismet, of how any action, however small and unintentional, has deep, permanent ramifications. All three of the main characters - Danny, Ray, Holly - depict in a touching, too-close-to-home sort of way how our lives can so easily sour. Danny's disappointment in himself (despite, or maybe because of, his very auspicious childhood) and being in denial of that disappointment is all too clearly the inevitable result of living life without concrete goals and dreams and pointing his life rather aimlessly. Which is painful and scary, because how many of us ever really know what we truly, really want and need? I loved how his relationship with his parents - and especially his father - is so thoroughly and simply explained, in small asides and one-liners. And I really appreciated the closure of the full circle completed when Holly fulfills Ann's dreams for the castle hotel. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"May 29, 2012","May 28, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/736394.The_Keep

Because after I read this book, I had to immediately re-read it. Which I never do, and haven't done since Jane Eyre as a teenager. The re-read was necessary because during the first reading, all the way up and through close to 70% of the book, I was thinking 'oh what the crap. I don't get it. Why'd this shit win the Pulitzer?!' and 'Olive Kitteridge JUST did this!!' So I was very surprised when I started liking this book (around 87% - the second to last chapter/story - the infamous Powerpoint chapter), and when I ended up REALLY liking the book when I finished, I thought I'd re-read it to figure out why. But I'm withholding the last half star, because I'd rather not have to read books two times back-to-back to understand my enjoyment. (Which is different from reading books again and again FOR my enjoyment. That's good. And would most likely increase a book's star rating.)Please ignore the ridiculous title. It's the book's only misstep and it is not silly nor superficial as its title implies. I've read a lot of complaints about the cover art, but having read it on the Kindle, I was spared that annoyance. Although, if given the choice, I would have read this book originally as a paperback, as the ability to flip back and revisit a character or event would have been essential for maximizing this experience. (If I'd been able to do that, I would not have needed to go back and re-read the whole damn thing.)This book is amazing because it IS like Olive Kitteridge. But with Time thrown in. And man, Time is so freaking trippy, it's enough to make this book an original. It's one big mesh of a story and Egan peeks into it from many different angles and vantage points in space time. She explores time's affect on the delicate, intricate, complex intertwining of lives and paths. The book also dances around in time and sometimes you land before an event, sometimes after, and yet you still understand the impact of the event - even if only points A and B are explained, the path from A to B can be felt, understood. I loved how the structure of the book parallels the cyclical nature of Time, ending with the characters it began with and achieving satisfying (if melancholy) closure. While reading the book resulted in severe, sad bouts of sentimental nostalgia, it was comforting that someone out there (Egan specifically) can articulate the universal agony of aging, of leaving your youth behind, along with chunks of innocence, purity, faith. And potential, especially.While many of these chapters and stories were just plain sad and tired (Rob's, Jocelyn's, Lou's), three portraits resonated differently with me - Scotty's, Bennie's and Sasha's. (Lulu was a little frightening with her seemingly-supernatural powers.) Despite his triumph (or maybe because of the scale of his triumph), Scotty's arc felt unreal, fantastical and almost unbelievable, or at the least believable one of the book. Bennie - oh Bennie. While completely and utterly real and believable, I had such and ambivalent reaction to him - as his cyclical arc seems to just entail finding and marrying young, ridiculously beautiful women. Who he may or many not continue to cheat on. How was his relationship with Chris by the end of the book?? Why did Chris not factor in, in any way? Sasha's development pierced me. Her downward spiral did not touch me - but her redemption did, because it came in such a banal, normal form: to be an annoying, embarrassing mother to a teenager daughter who doesn't get what her dad sees in her mom, and is many years away from discovering how much she loves, admires and respects her mother. I became fixated on Joe and Lulu's unknown tenuous connection during my second reading and have been trying to map its path mentally. Here: Joe's grandfather performed as a warrior on the same African safari trip as Lulu's mother's (La Doll / Dolly) one-time employee's (Stephanie) ex-husband's (Bennie) mentor (Lou). Did I do that right? Although Lulu also ends up working for Bennie, which is more of a more direct connection. So that would be: Joe's grandfather was on the same trip as Lulu's boss' mentor. Oh all the connections!

My Derek!A book for Jeter and/or Yankees lovers, both of which I am, avowedly. It covers the time period in the '90s when the Yankees stormed and reclaimed the throne, and Derek Jeter started his ascension, as the two coincided naturally (but really, as the book hypothesizes, it was all DJ), up through the 2010 season. But I was also hoping to find an answer to ""what is his kryptonite?"" through this book because HOW can he be so perfect? And really didn't get an answer. Beyond ""luck."" He's a fluke. Ok yea, fantabulous parents, but nobody's naive enough to believe that that guarantees anything, especially not his level of success and achievement. If he were a character in a novel, he would feel unconvincingly one-dimensional in all his perfection.Let's list all of Derek's negative attributes from the book because I think there are only like three anyway:- Can't take negative criticism. Because the rest of us all respond so well to negative criticism. And I don't even believe this one, because he takes that shit from everyone everyday....Red Sox fans, the media, his manager, commentators, Yankees fans! I cannot consider this a weak spot of his.- Maybe some sort of commitment-phobe...? Only because he made that remark to his friend about 'this is why I'm never getting married' regarding the Tiger Woods incident (which kind of didn't make sense to me - what? you don't want to get married because you're afraid you're going to have an affair on your wife and enrage the shit out of her? Ok ya, don't get married yet. At least not to someone who's not me.). But that's not really a strong enough theme, as he's displayed loyalty and commitment in all other aspects of his life, to his team, city, family, friends, etc.- I swear there's a third, when I was counting earlier, I had another example but I can't remember it now.- Oh I remember. He's still scared of his parents. I mean, kudos to his parents, I'm sure all parents everywhere would love to forever have this much influence over their children, but I think he's being a bit of a baby. Or I will choose to think that so that I have a third negative attribute for this list.- Wait, there's a fourth - he holds grudges and hasn't mastered the art of forgiving/forgetting and turning the other cheek. That might be a real, genuine character flaw...although not quite as dark, juicy as, say, alcoholism or steroids usage.So the book was disappointing in that...I didn't feel it got as deep as I wanted it to. But that's probably just because I'm convinced there's some big and nasty buried under there and if I can find out what it is, I'll have a little piece of him for myself. Or maybe he's just boringly perfect. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,May 2011,"May 07, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9925251-the-captain

But it did, and was every but as satisfying and fulfilling as hoped for.This series overall had the hallmarks of the ultimate reading experience for me: the mad dash, racing towards the ending because you must know what happens next, and the pang of melancholy and emptiness that hits on the last page because the book is finished and you have to leave its world and its people.I really appreciated how Collins resolved the Peeta-or-Gale dilemma, especially as Katniss was really getting on my nerves with her ""oh-how-do-I-pick-between-Perfect-Man-1-and-Perfect-Man-2"" situation and I was nervous that she would never pick, that her self-loathing nature would compel her to continue ping-ponging between them forever, to pine for the one in more pain, the one who was more unreachable in that moment (one of the more overt unbelievable threads from this series was that these two would be so patient and understanding with Katniss' indecisiveness throughout.) Collins definitely solved this one neatly and satisfyingly for me too, and it felt like a 'duh, had to be him all along' answer (in a good way). Who Katniss ends up with feels inevitable to their essential natures - while Gale and Peeta seem like Siamese clones at first, in the deepest and most important sense they are the complete opposite. They're really just Bizarros of each other, and there was always only one Katniss could share a life with. Like how Coin and Snow were Bizarros of each other, and in the end, Katniss could only let one live too - the honest one.

I was thoroughly relieved when Katniss saved both her and Peeta's lives with her feint at suicide because I so desperately wanted them to make it but I didn't know how Collins could pull it off without being cheesy and/or unbelievable, which I thought she accomplished with this well-thought plot twist - 'yes totally! turn it on the Capitol and they'll totally let you both live!'The characters are so complete and whole, with all the depth and complexity found in reality, and yet all universal too. From Katniss' stubbornness and constant suspicion, to Gale's deep anger, to even Peeta's innocent, noble goodness (because we've all met one of those people in our lives, and wished there were more...or at least wished we were more like them).

While I have to applaud a book for its ability to affect my emotions so greatly, it's still difficult to be so consistently and constantly sad when reading such a book, especially for someone (me) who reads novels specifically to escape the doldrums and sadness of reality. This is the story of a newspaper - its birth, life and death, interspersed with a series of nuanced, believable and poignant character sketches of the various lives connected to this newspaper. Each sketch is beautifully and convincingly written.Most of (well, really, all except one of) these sketches depict an abrupt downward arc/spiral and each life in each chapter ends a little (or a lot) worse than it started (Herman's being the only exception - and the only character I genuinely and generally liked and didn't pity in some way). I suppose one could argue that Ruby's and Ornella's stories don't really arc downwards, but these are two of the more pitiable, unlikeable eccentric characters so I didn't really care either which way they arc-ed.The only story/chapter/sketch I found wincingly unconvincing was Abbey's, in terms of how it ends - so harsh and requiring a level of skillful acting on Dave's part that I had a hard time accepting. And of course, I very much hated how Oliver Ott's chapter ended (poor poor Schop), although it was somewhat believable - which just goes to show what I think of human nature. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jan 20, 2013","Apr 19, 2011",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/8171863-the-imperfectionists

But we're all ignorant, and that's what makes us different - those that fight ignorance, and those that embrace it, or give into it.

But I got over that soon enough; it helped that the story is also narrated through two other, different, distinct perspectives. Switching between perspectives helped the empathy level in this context, interestingly, because it's for some reason easier to feel the black women's fear and fright and paranoia when it's contrasted with the white woman's comfort, ease and privilege. The book drew me in to such a degree that there were parts I felt were 'nail-biting' as we all waited for and anticipated the consequences of the maids' published stories.The Aibileen and Skeeter characters were the main protagonists, although somewhat also the least interesting/complex/multi-dimensional.

As someone who also has to work with creative egos on a daily basis, I also SO SO SO agree with her conscious decision not to hire/work with volatile personalities and wish more managers would abide by this rule of thumb.Of course, while I respect her decision not to 'exploit' her slashing incident, I also wanted to read more about it.

It was a book that, when you are finished reading it, makes you pause, absorb, ponder and appreciate for a few minutes, before you do whatever it is you'll do next. And appreciate not just the book, but Life too. Because the book does capture the enormity and ridiculous senselessness (although Verghese would probably just call that 'fate') that life is, and it hits you uncomfortably.While the book did eventually pull me in, it did so slowly...a little painfully. Before I adjusted to the book's pace and rhythm, I impatiently found it irritating and a bit meandering. The level of specific detail that Verghese's medical background probably commands and his penchant to dive into a long and involved backstory about whatever character happens to pass through the room drove me a little crazy at first, as interesting the backstory/character was. (""Nooooo tell me what happens NEXT, not what happened BEFORE!!"")Once the main characters were established though, and the story chose to settle on Marion's perspective, I was more pulled in - although I never fully adjusted to his level of detail, especially medically-speaking. I didn't give it the last/fifth star because I don't think I appreciated it quite as completely as someone with a medical background (or at least penchant) would have. By the end, becoming accustomed to the book's tendency to veer into lengthy medical text, for me, just meant that I was comfortable with skimming entire paragraphs (while hanging onto every word in other parts), e.g. when - on the cusp of the liver transplant - it delves into a deep description and almost exaltation of the liver, including its functions and even appearance (which I actually anticipated - it was both odd and endearing to accurately predict when the book would deliver a medical sermon, as if I'd gotten to know an eccentric friend well).It was easy to forgive Verghese's indulgences because they clearly came from a place of passion, conviction and insight. Passion is always so compelling and hard to look away from. And with Ethiopia, Verghese painted a haunted, dark, beautiful country that is misunderstood and under-appreciated in deep ways. I would like to visit, but it feels like an irrelevant and trivial desire to express. As if putting a country, a continent, a destination on my Top 10 Trips list is not doing it justice and almost doing it an injustice....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Mar 05, 2011","Mar 05, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3591262-cutting-for-stone

I appreciated that it wasn't REALLY a true mystery novel because Cassie pretty much gives away 'whodunnit' at the beginning of the book, but that didn't diminish the power or the mystery of the story whatsoever. (I know he wasn't technically the final culprit, but I thought who actually did the stabbing in the end wasn't even that relevant.) With its creepy, Victorian, doppelganger undertones, this book is so magical and mystical. And there were many more 'truths' that I identified with in this story (versus ""In the Woods""). As Cassie is wooed and becomes enthralled by the eerily close relationship between these friends, I too yearned to be part of this Fantastic Five, who need and satisfy each other more than reality ever could.Unsurprisingly, French writes from the female perspective in a much more appealing, compelling and realistic way than from a male's (again vs ""In""). I loved both stubborn, independent Cassie and even crazy, selfish, broken Lexie. I like how French tends to write from a hindsight-is-20-20 perspective, but we'll see if that gets old as I'm planning on starting ""A Faithful Place"" as soon as I finish this .

The interview with Connolly captured exactly my love for reading and readers with the following: ""I think the act of reading imbues the reader with a sensitivity toward the outside world that people who don't read can sometimes lack. I know it seems like a contradiction in terms; after all, reading is such a solitary, internalized act that it appears to represent a disengagement from day-today life. But reading, and particularly the reading of fiction, encourages us to view the world in new and challenging ways. I have always believed that fiction acts as a prism, taking the reality of our existence and breaking it down to its constituent parts, allowing us to see it in a completely different form. It allows us to inhabit the consciousness of another, which is a precursor to empathy, and empathy is, for me, one of the marks of a decent human being.""
