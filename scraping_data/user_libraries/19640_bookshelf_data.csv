It does make you reflect on how we view our dead and our practices herein, and the numerous ways cadavers can be useful to advancing science and safety, if we could get past some of our squeamishness. As Roach says, it’s only in the last 100 years that going to a doctor reliably meant that you could get real help for some of what ails you — and cadavers are a part of those advances. And a reminder of the gross and horrifying alternatives that were concocted as medical care without better knowledge of the body and diseases. Roach has a funny writing style that also helps make the subject more palatable. It does make me reconsider what I would like done with my body when I die — beyond my planned organ donation. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jan 03, 2024","Jan 30, 2024","Jan 03, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/56769575-stiff

The number of people who profited off Spears, and her classic girl people-pleasing manner, created a gutting turn of events for her. I’ll never fully understand how no one who supposedly cared about her didn’t think to look into different legal representation for her in 13 years of conservatorship. And Spears does seem very gullible. But it feels like a cautionary tale for all women.

He has very legitimate issues with his family, the press, and the horrifying racist threats and comments he and Megan have endured. I know he's a prince, but you can't help but feel empathy for him and Megan, and the desire for privacy and to not be hunted like an animal. That said, sweet baby Jesus this book needed an editor. It clocked in at 16 hours, and it should have been 12 hours max. His message would have been more impactful if it had been tightened up. I also can't help feeling a bit sad, because this book is definitely ""scorched earth"" -- his issues with his family are real, but with this sort of tell-all book, you don't see how someone can go back to having a relationship with their sibling, parent, etc. after it. And maybe this sadness comes from being a mom, and knowing how much pain I would feel if my kids never spoke again. Everyone deserves peace and privacy, and I hope he finds a way to achieve it. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Nov 22, 2023","Jan 03, 2024","Nov 22, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/62296528-spare

As I was reading it, I couldn't help thinking about the novel Forrest Gump -- the story of a man who happens to be in the right place at the right time, at multiple key moments in US history. Forrest Gump is a fiction novel. This book is ""based on a true story,"" which increasingly falls into a grey category, where true life gets punched up for more cinematic flair. The author has said it's about 90% true, but there were -- for me -- too many instances where it just pushed the limits of credulity. About 2/3 through the book, I said to myself, ""If at the end, Lella just so happens to walk into the square where Mussolini was strung up, I call bulls*it."" And lo and behold (spoiler alert), not only does he just so happen to be walking by when he hears a commotion, and not only is he at the square, he witnesses the moment when he and Petacci's bodies are strung up and destroyed by an angry mob. It was the sixth or so ""what are the odds?"" moment I had in this book. It appears there are others who also question the veracity of the story, if you read some literary blogs. If it really did all happen to him, Lella lived an amazing and remarkable life, made to be put into film. And as fate would have it, the film rights were sold, and it will be a movie starring Tom Holland. And if he did even half of the things in the book, it's a remarkable life -- which is why I'm giving the benefit of the doubt and giving 3 stars. But this book demonstrates a trend I don't care for, of changing the truth to make for a better story -- which then isn't non-fiction. Let's hope I'm wrong and all of Lella's story is right....more",Notes are private!,1,0,1,"Nov 21, 2023",Dec 2023,"Nov 21, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/32487617-beneath-a-scarlet-sky

It came on my radar thanks to the NYT Read Like the Wind newsletter, and it's the sort of book I want to alternately cling to my chest and hand out to every single book lover I know. Read as an audiobook (and as charming as the written book must be, the actors reading it made it like a stage play and so infinitely better), it contains the correspondence between New York writer Helen Hanff and a small secondhand book shop in London, whom she writes to after seeing their ad in the paper and is looking for specific books. Going from 1949-1969, what starts as a more formal correspondence ends in deep love, friendship, and affection between people who never get to meet. It was also illuminating of life for ordinary people in the 1950s, when, for example, food rations persisted in Britain until 1952 (despite the war ending in 1945). I had no idea.Do you love stories about people who love books? This is for you. Do you love stories about unexpected cross-cultural friendships? This for you. Stories of intelligent, independent, forge-your-own-way- midcentury women? This is for you. Love New York? London? Funny Jewish women? You catch my drift.

Many of these essays should be required reading -- What We All Lose and the In Alienable Rights of Women are particularly poignant. Thoughtful and thought provoking, these essays aren't a quick read or listen. They are meaty and sometimes difficult.

And of how ""genre literature"" like romance and sci-fi/fantasy have been so much more embracing of female novelists. It made me reflect on my own reading each year, and I was surprised and embarrassed to see that each year, on average, only 1/3 of books I read are written by women.

A lovely, almost romantic memoir of a man, broken by the unexpected death of his brother at age 27, who quits his job at The New Yorker and decides to become a security guard at the Met. It’s a reflection on the role of art, beauty, and history in our world, and our need to reflect and feel awe. It’s also a love letter to the people around us who do jobs and are often not seen. Yes, he doesn’t really touch upon the thorny legacy of museums like the Met, and how they acquired (or stole) some of their priceless pieces. But it’s a small quibble to a book that I just found genuinely lovely.

It's a quick diverting read, but Tarloff even notes at the end that he interviewed people who were leaders at SF Opera 20+ years ago and he diverted from what they told him was how things actually work. So he knows he's portraying things inaccurately. That was annoying, but creative license, whatever. But he also makes a point of Development being this person's job, so it was irritating to see it portrayed so wrong. Also, Toby never works. Like it's somehow acceptable for him to never be in the office, to never be at a performance, etc. He does have a lot of sex. As a former colleague said to me in reading the book : ""I don't remember any afternoon trysts. I do remember a lot of board meetings and a lot of work in Excel.""My other issue is this book feels like it was written 20+ years ago and didn't get picked up then. Tarloff tried to dust it off and submit it again in 2021, and this time it was accepted, but they didn't bother to make any real attempt to make it read like the era it is supposed to be taking place in (2022, post pandemic). All of these characters in their 40s have a landline phone. When Toby goes into the office, his assistant hands him pink slips with his messages. He talks of hot days in San Francisco needing AC (hahaha), and how easy it was for his daughter to get into UC Berkeley, the local college (comical even 20 years ago). There are literally two lines referencing the pandemic -- otherwise I would have thought it was taking place in 2000. There's creative license and then there's laziness. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Feb 03, 2023","Feb 13, 2023","Feb 03, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60864838-tell-me-the-truth-about-love

</div></td>",,,Hollywood's Eve: Eve Babitz and the Secret History of L.A.,"Anolik, Lili*",1501125796,9781501125799,1501125796,288        pp,3.57,"1,963","Jan 08, 2019","Jan 08, 2019",really liked it,1 of 5 stars2 of 5 stars3 of 5 stars4 of 5 stars5 of 5 starsadd to shelves,"I first learned about Eve Babitz when I saw a picture of her playing chess naked with Marcel Duchamp. It was part of an art exhibition in LA a decade I first learned about Eve Babitz when I saw a picture of her playing chess naked with Marcel Duchamp. It was part of an art exhibition in LA a decade or so ago, and it stuck with me for two reasons: 1) This was definitely not the Duchamp I learned about in AP Art History; and 2) Her rather spectacular chest, coupled with her face completely obscured. It was like this ultimate reveal, alongside wanting to be discreet.When Joan Didion died earlier this year, I read a piece that referenced Eve Babitz, and how she and Joan were friends, but that they had very different takes on life in LA. I read Didion’s Play it As It Lays in college, expecting to love it because it was written by a fellow Cal alum, about my hometown of southern California. I felt betrayed by it. Yes, the writing was excellent. But it felt like Didion’s portrayal of LA was so shallow and one dimensional; it lacked the depth and nuance to which any person who actually lived there could attest. Babitz was mentioned in this article about Didion as a counterpoint – she was all the sex, drugs, and rock ‘n roll of the ‘70s in LA, but with a more authentic mix of LA thrown in.So I picked up this biography on Babitz, which is probably the only time I’ve read a biography about an author before actually reading anything by the author. Anolik is a Vanity Fair writer and an admitted superfan of Babitz, and her 2015 profile of Babitz led to Babitz’s books being reissued after being OOP for years. The book feels a bit too super fan at times, but she also helps give a lot of insights into Babitz’s writing I otherwise wouldn’t have had.In 2022, Babitz would be called a body positive, sex positive bisexual. In the ‘70s, she was often dismissed as a buxom LA girl, a bit of a floosy, and a starf*cker. Which is in fact not true, because she did have relationships with an enormous amount of celebrities – but she did before they were stars. Harrison Ford, Annie Leibowitz, Steve Martin, Ed Ruscha, Jim Morrison – she played a foundational role in their careers. Anolik calls all of the living past lovers up, and every one of them credited Babitz with some seminal piece of their image, their style, advice on their career, etc. She was more than a muse, and she has stayed friends with most of her numerous ex-lovers, never marrying. In fact, when she got second and third degree burns in a freak fire in the '90s, all of those friends and ex-lovers contributed $500K+ to her medical bills.Babitz’s father Sol was the first violinist of the LA Phil, as well as the first violinist of the MGM Studio Orchestra. Igor Stravinsky is her godfather. She and her sister Mirandi (with an equally fascinating life, though not a writer) successfully straddled the world of art, culture, and entertainment in LA, when the city often gets dismissed for only having one of those three.So now I go on to actually reading some of Babitz’s writing (most of which is labeled fiction, but is really non-fiction with the real people’s names changed), which I hope lives up to Anolik’s loving portrayal of a brilliant, difficult person who was written off for not being what most of America wanted to see in a woman in the ‘70s....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jun 23, 2022","Jul 04, 2022","Jun 23, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/38532113-hollywood-s-eve

Years ago I switched to only reading Sedaris via audiobooks. He's a phenomenal narrator of his own stories, landing jokes with surgical precision, but also providing critical and unvarnished emotion when the stories lean more towards pathos. As he has aged (and haven't we all), the pathos and tragedy of life has been more and more a part of his stories. The strained relationship and suicide of his sister Tiffany, his difficult and (to put it generously) unique father, who is now 96 and at the end of his life, and the challenges of the pandemic were front and center in this collection. As a writer, I marvel at his ability to balance humor and unflinchingly honest criticism on a knife's point. I can't think of another living writer who has made laugh out loud -- hard -- only to sucker punch me a few pages/beats later with a heartbreaking story about himself or others in his circle. We definitely have different viewpoints on some things, but having read all of his stories -- and in a way, growing up with him, even if he's 20 years my senior -- I appreciate the unvarnished, and often hilarious ways we looks at the relationships that will evolve and shift the most over the course of your life: those with your spouse and your family. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Oct 13, 2022","Oct 19, 2022","May 30, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58989873-happy-go-lucky

I read Morgenstern’s first novel, The Night Circus, mostly on a train ride in Spain years ago. It was a magical, immersive book — better than I could have hoped for a long ride. This book suffered from my having expectations for more of that magic. It had elements of it, but it desperately needed a better editor.

At times hard to read as a parent, and the idea of your child growing up adrift without you. Pages 200-400: Jesus, this poor kid. This life. And now the abusive father dies, so...yay? Freedom, yes, but now he’s an orphan and this is such an incredibly difficult life. Breaking my heart. Pages 400-600: Oh good, we are back in New York. And Hobie! Yay for Hobie!! Can I have more Hobie?And his life is getting better....and then his only childhood friend Andy dies?!? Must we just keep piling it on? Does this need to be this long?Pages 600-700: Boris is back...yay? The picture is actually gone, Kitsey is cheating on Theo, Pippa doesn’t love him, and Lucius Reeve is about to destroy him? Honestly, are we incapable of giving this character any happiness? Does this need to be this long? Isn’t there an editor for this book, anywhere?Pages 700-760: Murder, suicide attempt, he’s still marrying damn Kitsey. I swear to God, if Popchik the dog gets killed then there better be a John Wick twist to this book I didn’t see coming. I’m so frustrated because Tartt has made me care deeply about Theo but it’s almost feeling maudlin at this point. Pages 760-771: WTF? After 771 pages, this is the ending she’s come up with?

A lot of people I know love Kristin Hannah, and maybe this wasn’t the right choice for a first book to read by her. Or a book to read around Christmas. Many pulled quotes on the cover and back talk about it being an “epic story,” and it is, in the sense that it is big, long book. But it was also a slog at times, particularly because it started to feel like 500 pages of misery. I felt dread reading it. I don’t need (or even want) a book to be happy most of the time, but it bordered on misery porn meets Alaska Romeo and Juliet. It’s true that the happy ending that occurs in the last 15 pages of a 600 page novel felt hard fought for and hard won, and as a reader you can’t help thinking, “Finally, some joy for these people.” I guess I can say I appreciated the book while also not feeling much pleasure reading it....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Dec 15, 2023","Dec 24, 2023","May 08, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34927828-the-great-alone

A novel about a girl coming of age in San Diego while the world around her is, possibly ending, because the rotation of the Earth is slowing? Sign me up. But this book ended being tiresome and frustrating. Walker never gives any of the characters any real emotional depth, so I never really cared about anyone. I see what she was trying to do — to show that to a 11-year old girl, it might feel more like the world is ending because the boy she likes isn’t talking to her, rather than the actual climate of the world changing and ending. But for an adult reader, it doesn’t land. Maybe it should have been tweaked to be for YA audience. I stick it out in the hope that the ending would improve my opinion.

In recent years, with podcasts like Serial and Dirty John, I’ve found I enjoy true crime. However, this book showed me that what I like is the puzzle element — the searching and sorting through clues, and trying to find answers. I don’t enjoy recounting all the lurid details of the crime. McNamara doesn’t go overboard and handles it reasonably well, but the sheer volume and type of crimes was disturbing with the Golden State Killer — more than 50 rapes, and 11 people killed. Hearing the details of so many was pretty unsettling, coupled with the fact that some of the crimes occurred only 30 minutes away from my house. I read as an audio book, and I definitely don’t recommend listening to it when you are home alone, at dusk. MacNamara is a talented writer and if she could have finished it before her untimely passing, I think it would have been 4-5 stars. It’s sad that she died before seeing the Golden State Killer arrested, when he and his crimes consumed so much of her life. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Feb 06, 2019","Mar 07, 2019","Feb 06, 2019",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/35068432-i-ll-be-gone-in-the-dark

Lots of laugh out loud funny stories, but also many filled with pathos. Sedaris reflects on getting older, the aging of his father, and his sister’s suicide. One story in particular involving his sister is warts-and-all ugly, showing the cruelty people can show to people they love. It does not reflect well on him, but I appreciate that he wrote it.

One of the things that I picked up this book based on a rave  in Entertainment Weekly, and their specific recommendation to try the audio book. One of the things that struck from the  was that Saunders was inspired by a single moment he learned of in Lincoln's life. Following the death of Lincoln's 10 year-old son Willie, it was said that Lincoln visited his son's body in its temporary internment place, and that Lincoln would pull his son's body from the coffin, hold it, and weep. That image stuck with Saunders for 20 years as the germination of a book. Perhaps it struck me because I have also carried around an idea for a novel based on one single moment in Lincoln's life. He's a remarkable template for a novel.This is a bizarre, brilliant, and unexpectedly moving novel, and an as aside, it is one of the best audiobooks I have ever listened to. I personally think it might be better than reading the novel. Much has been made of the fact that the audiobook has a cast of over 160 people, with the two leads being Nick Offerman (Vollman) and David Sedaris (Bevins), as well as the author Saunders as the Reverend. Bill Hader, Megan Mullally, Carrie Brownstein, Susan Sarandon, and Keegan Michael Key are some of the marquee names in it, most with bit parts. Because of the cast, I expected the book to be a comedy. I don't think it is, though it does have some funny moments. But Sedaris, Saunders, and especially Offerman are terrific. Offerman is best known for comedy but he brings a pathos and empathy to his reading that I wasn't expecting.The basic premise of the book is that when Willie Lincoln dies of typhoid, he goes to the 'bardo,' a Tibetan Buddhist concept of the place between the world of the living and afterlife. In it he meets a variety of characters, and the core thing is that none of them think they are dead -- merely sick. They are people who, for various reasons, cannot detach from their mortal life and are not prepared to move on. Indeed, when a host of angels comes to the Bardo periodically, trying to persuade these souls to move on, the inhabitants of the Bardo look on them as demons, trying to convince them they are dead when surely they are not. Children rarely stay in the Bardo -- they usually move on in a matter of minutes, or at most, a few hours. Willie Lincoln is different. When his father comes to visit his body in the mausoleum, he and his father share a moment, a connection between the two worlds, which has never happened before in the Bardo. It is fascinating to all of the inhabitants, and Willie does not want to move on -- he wants to be with his father.There is so much going on in this book, from the relationship between these spirits and their past lives to what is happening in the world of the living -- where Lincoln is in the thick of the Civil War and he cannot help but acknowledge how many sons are dying, and yet he cannot move on from the loss of his own. Saunders handles all of this brilliantly and empathetically.I will admit that the first 1-2 hours of the book were hard for me to get into. Saunders likes to use countless quotes -- some real, some made up -- to back up the story of what was actually happening to Lincoln in this moment in history. It was jarring and strange and there were moments where it felt like a hot mess. But once the narrative began to focus more on the Bardo, the story gelled for me, and shortly after that I couldn't put it down, so to speak. I found myself trying to listen to it every moment I could get.One of the places where Saunders is arguably most successful is in his telling of the relationship between Lincoln and Willie, and what Lincoln experiences at the loss of his son. Perhaps it's because I'm a parent now, but it taps into that deep, primal fear that every parent has of losing their child. That no one should ever have to bury their child. It goes against the natural order of things, and it is utterly soul crushing. On a personal level, it was heartbreaking to read. Add onto this that the person who lost their child is trying to lead a nation during a Civil War. He handles all of this so beautifully, so poignantly, that I find myself thinking of the book long after I stop reading it....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Mar 14, 2018","Mar 17, 2018","Mar 14, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/30254065-lincoln-in-the-bardo

At its core, this is a sad and tragic story, and I can't say I always took pleasure reading it. 500+ pages where the characters seem to experience sadness and little in the way of happiness made it feel -- at times -- like a slog. But I have tremendous respect for Atwood as a writer. Her narrative structure with this book (with a book within a book and a collection of news clippings over time) in particular was fabulous. It was like the slow peeling of an onion, revealing layer by layer the backstory of his family. It constantly kept you wondering, and when a large piece of the mystery gets revealed (or peeled off) about halfway through the novel it invigorated my enthusiasm for the story. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Aug 25, 2017","Oct 13, 2017","Aug 25, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13613272-the-blind-assassin

America has been divided into territories overseen by the Germans or Japanese, African-Americans have been forced back into slavery, Jews  and Africans have been all but exterminated, and the world lives in fear of nuclear war between Japan and Germany.This book would have been unsettling to read at any time, but to be reading it while the attack in Charlottesville occurred, as well as when a president makes claims of using ""fire and fury like the world has never seen"" regarding nuclear war with North Korea...honestly, I don't have words. This book resonated and disturbed me so profoundly, in no small part because a science fiction book written 55 years ago was becoming eerily relevant to my life today. In a way I never dreamed possible. In a way, I imagine, Dick himself might not have thought possible. Because I perhaps foolishly thought we were better.It's a brutal book, and not always easy to read or follow. The ending messes with your head and has you thinking long after you put it down.

It's often said she writes with warmth, which she does -- she creates fully formed, imperfect characters that you care about. Knowing some of Patchett's own life story, I'm curious how much comes from her own life. The conceit of a book about the family called Commonwealth is a clever one.

If I'm being honest, this book feels like a short story idea that didn't have enough to it to be made into **spoiler alert** Warning: spoilers ahead. If I'm being honest, this book feels like a short story idea that didn't have enough to it to be made into a 400 page novel, but the effort was made nonetheless. On the surface it had so many elements I enjoy: a quirky family, an amusement park, perhaps something supernatural, a touch of Southern Gothic in the modern day. A family that runs a theme park dedicated to wrestling alligators in the Everglades is devastated by the death of their mother. If this book is supposed to be about anything, it's supposed to be about grief and how this family copes with it. One daughter believes she is communicating with ghosts and soon falls in love with one; the son goes to work for a competing, grotesque theme park about hell. The father goes to the mainland and leaves the children alone for literally months at a time. And then there is Ava, our 13 year old narrator observing it all.As I read the book I struggled to connect emotionally with these characters, which was surprising given that they were going through loss. But I kept going, particularly as daughter Ossie starts her regular communications with ghosts and reveals the story of the dead dredgeman whom she loves and plans to marry. When she runs away to marry him, and Ava meets a quirky man in the Swamp named the Birdman (dressed in feathers and long hair, hired to help remove the local buzzard population) who tells her he can bring her to the Underworld and save her sister, things get interesting. Is there really a supernatural world in the swamps? Did Ossie actually fall in love with the ghost and get spirited to the underworld?What follows is a swampish, Odyssey lite, one of many homages to Greek mythology in the book. Over the course of several days, the Birdman and Ava float and sail through the swamps, heading to the underworld, and the Birdman seems to have at least some altruistic thread in him, even if he is odd and there might something unhinged about him.And then things go sideways, literally and figuratively. The Birdman rapes 13 year old Ava, and she, in a bit of Stockholm Syndrome, thanks him afterward. This whole plot thread felt inconsistent with the characters and too August: Osage County -- needlessly titillating and scandalous, as if you can shock people enough then they won't notice the flaws in your plot and story. It infuriated me. What follows is Ava running way through the swamps, trying to survive and escape. When she and her sister are saved, it feels hollow because i don't have an emotional connection to them (when I should) and I feel like a pawn whom the author tried to shock into caring. It felt like a book about nothing except shock when it could have been a moving exploration of grief through the eyes of a child.The prose is strong, and this could be a a great short story, but it was ultimately unsatisfying....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Apr 14, 2017","May 29, 2017","Apr 14, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8584686-swamplandia

To be fair, I had no intention of reading this book, particularly after reading several s. But it was NOTE: This  contains some spoilers. To be fair, I had no intention of reading this book, particularly after reading several s. But it was given to me by a loved one, who told me that I should form my own opinions about it. So I did. This book was written before Lee wrote To Kill A Mockingbird, and wasn't an after-the-fact sequel. This fact is helpful when assessing the book. It also should be said that for 50+ years this book was not published while Lee was still of sound mind. Her sister, who managed her affairs after Lee's mind gave way, fiercely protected her. And then her sister died, and someone else took over Lee's affairs. And I truly believe that if Lee were of sound mind this would not have been published. She had 50+ years to do it and she never did, and I think for good reason. To me, it seems the motivations to publish were purely financial (and not to benefit her), and it forever changes her legacy.I believe I was given this book to read for the positives in it. Scout, now age 26 and living in New York, comes back to Maycomb on holiday and realizes for the first time how different her beliefs and values, particularly when it comes to racial equality, are from her lifelong friends and loved ones. Scout is a strong and passionate independent woman in the 1960s, and (one hopes) most readers will empathize with her struggle amidst the racism she sees around her, and her desire to have her own identity and own ideas and not just be someone's docile wife. And one could argue that the book paints a reasonably accurate picture of race relations and perceptions in the rural South in the 1960s, as awful as they were. It also becomes a story in which a child must recognize their parent as a flawed and imperfect human, and take them down from their pedestal. In those ways, this book has some merit.But it is the complete and utter degradation of the character of Atticus Finch and his seemingly newfound libertarian/state's rights/benevolent child perception of racism and race equality that gnaws at me without end. For me, Atticus Finch was and has been one of the most noble characters in all of literature. He's the sort of character people name their child after, in the hope that their child can emulate some of his most noble virtues. To see him as an older and yes, racist man, is devastating and also out of character with who he is To Kill A Mockingbird. The trial and his actions as a younger man are mentioned in the book, and Scout clearly believes that the same person who represented a one-armed black child accused of raping a white girl couldn't be the same racist older man. I feel the same. I feel like Lee wrote this manuscript to get a feel for her characters, and she told the story she wanted to tell when she wrote To Kill A Mockingbird. She dropped the microphone and peaced out after writing one great masterpiece. This book completely tarnishes that, and that saddens things for me. I fully admit to being one of those readers who loves the Atticus Finch of To Kill A Mockingbird. That book had a profound and lasting impact on me, not the least of which because this was a good, just, and noble man, a quietly unremarkable everyday hero who did the right thing because it was simply that -- the right and noble thing.

The crime and mystery itself were interesting, but I didn't quite anticipate the historical relativism I would have to use. I should have, but I didn't. Women are only there to be sexual enticements and sometimes devious objects (emphasis on objects) and sometimes in this world you have to knock women around from time to time to get them in line.

It really hit its stride in its last 50 pages. It's a testament to friendship, major life changes, and reading, and fittingly was given to me by a friend. Here's one other passage that stayed with me, from the author's perspective as writer: ""I educated my soul through reading. I played with point-of-view, imagining other characters in the story, like my parents. Through this, I began to understand them, which softened me a little. As time went on I learned how events create plot, so when I felt that because my father had made a mess of his life I was bound to make a mess of mine or marry someone who'd mess it up for me -- well, eventually I had to admit this plot lacked the ""inevitability"" of a thoughtfully designed story.

I was prompted by an NPR Fresh Air interview I heard, in which the guest (author of a recent book on The Great Gatsby) talked about how these two books were almost forgotten when first published, but they gained a remarkable second life as part of the books for soldiers program in WWII. The publishers of Gatsby and A Tree Grows in Brooklyn gave thousands of free copies of the books to soldiers oversees as part of a government's armed services editions (made to fit into a pocket), and they were two of the most popular titles amongst soldiers, which I think says a lot about stories and themes resonated with soldiers at that time.It's a book that more or less chronicles the childhood of Francie Nolan, the semi-autographical character based on the author Betty Smith.

I love Amy Poehler, and so it pains me to give the book a mediocre . Throughout the book Poehler complains about not having enough time to write a book because she is so busy, and in a way it comes through in the content and depth of her book. It's not especially funny (not that it needed to be), but what I was really disappointed by was how surface level it was. She never goes into great depth or tells especially personal stories anywhere. For example, in her chapter about being a cofounder of Upright Citizens Brigade (UCB), she talks about how UCB goes from being a small improv group in New York to a massively successful, even accredited education program in two cities and whose promise is to never raise ticket prices over ten dollars. She explained this all in one paragraph. One. I sat there thinking, ""This is interesting. How did you do this? What where the challenges, etc?"" But she had already moved to another surface level discussion. Similarly, the chapter about Parks and Rec primarily consists of short paragraphs about each actor in which, like a People magazine column, she says what she likes best about each actor and one sentence about the time they made her laugh the hardest. That's it. She also never goes into personal details and never says a bad thing about anyone, which is commendable in its own way. But again, it felt so surface level to rarely go into any emotional detail. The chapter about her divorce from Will Arnett was so complimentary that I literally had to google any reasons as to why they broke up, because the way she writes it I couldn't see why they weren't together. By all accounts they split because they simply weren't in love with one another anymore, and all she needed to say was that. It's not bad mouthing and perhaps it would be hard to say, but it would have felt more honest. I was struck reading parts of this book because when Poehler writes about Tina Fey, she always talks about Tina writing whenever she had a moment. I hate to make the comparison (because I don't think it's fair and people never compare the books of two male comedians), but I couldn't help thinking that Tina's love of writing shone through in her memoir. I just don't think Poehler did have the bandwidth (or perhaps the passion) to write a memoir. And finally (and this is a criticism of the publisher, not her), the book was printed on high-gloss heavy paper, and as a result the damn thing weighed four pounds even though it was 300 pages. It was ridiculous, and I know I am a Luddite who still reads printed books, but come on. It felt like another way the publisher tried to give more substance to a book that didn't have as much to it as it should. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Dec 13, 2014","Dec 23, 2014","Dec 13, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/20910157-yes-please

But if a story of love, family, and the absurdity of war is one that you can handle, I would push this book in your hands and ask you to read it. This is not escape literature. I find myself thinking about it and the characters long after I put it down. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Oct 02, 2014","Oct 25, 2014","Oct 02, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18428067-a-constellation-of-vital-phenomena

And in the case of the Nazis, who looted and stole hundreds of thousands of pieces of art, how do you go about finding them? That said, this book was kind of dry and slow moving.

It deserves one of those big titles like ""a great American novel,"" or more specifically, a uniquely American novel. At it's core it's the story of a marriage (or in some ways, two marriages), but it's also the story of one family's life in the American West, and how it shapes them. The promise and hope that brought so many people out west, and the challenges that they faced once they got here. Stegner is a terrific writer, and while the book doesn't move quickly, it's the kind of novel you can sit for long periods with on a couch or hammock and lose yourself in. It's heartbreaking and moving and feels very authentic and real. If I had one criticism of the book (and why it isn't five stars) it's the ending. Stegner chooses to have the narrator, Lyman Ward, end the biography of Lyman's grandmother Susan Ward (around whom much of the book revolves) after a very specific moment in her life. It's a heartbreaking moment, but I found myself yearning to know more about their life after that moment. I imagine Stegner wants you to fill in the details, but it felt somewhat unfinished to me-- or rather that after writing 600 pages, he thought he needed to cut it short or else the book would be 1,000 pages. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Apr 03, 2014","Apr 28, 2014","Apr 03, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/292408.Angle_of_Repose

Lots of spoilers. I should begin this  by saying that I wanted to like this book. On paper, I should havWARNING: This  contains SPOILERS. Lots of spoilers. I should begin this  by saying that I wanted to like this book. On paper, I should have. And I tried to have some degree of historical relativism while reading it, but honestly the whole book was so maddening I could hardly stand it. There is NO character development whatsoever -- none. Aside from this, I'll try to detail out just some of the things that I think go wrong with it:1) The very premise of the book is flimsy and unengaging. 12 men go to the king and say ""We want magic so that people will remember our boring and unremarkable country for something. Send your son to a magic land so we can have some magic (no one, by the way, brings up the fact that someone magical already lives in their mist -- the female witch Zoorenderel, who enchants the sword and then basically raises the child (Orion) that Alveric and Lirazel have. Which is good, because these two suck at being parents. But she's a woman, so she couldn't possibly have value beyond this.)2) King of Erl's son Alveric goes to Elfland and takes the daughter, who has no redeeming value other than that she is pretty. In fact, this is a theme throughout the novel. She has no depth, no character, and all she cares about is staying young and pretty. And I guess she bore him an heir, but the child, for her, is an afterthought at best. 3) Let's be honest: Alveric and Lirazel aren't exactly meant for each other. They have nothing to connect on (not even their child), and when the King of Elfland steals his daughter back, don't you just think, ""Good. They weren't really working out so maybe this is for the best."" But no, I'm supposed to believe that there is some great love there, when LITERALLY all they have talked about is how they don't do anything together and she won't pray to Alveric's gods and it makes him so angry. So naturally he's going to go on this long quest to find her.4) AND THEN THEY START KILLING UNICORNS. It's a truth universally acknowledged that someone who kills unicorns is a bad person, right? At least, that's what Legend taught me as a kid. But here Orion, the 14-year old kid who has been raised by a witch because his parents have been MIA for 10 years hunts unicorns for sport. No other reason, just to kill them and mount their heads on walls. How is this my hero? And what is the point of this in the story??5) Alveric knowingly puts two legitimately insane people in charge of his quest to find Elfland (which, by the way is perhaps the most boring quest in the history of fantasy novels). This says a lot about the novel. It also gives the author a reason to drag out this flimsy story line ever further. He deserves to wander around for 12 years without finding anything. 6) Does anyone else find it weird that a grown woman (who has in fact had a child of her own) sits on her father's lap in Elfland all day long???7) The 12 men who asked for magic in Erl get it and then realize that they don't want it after all. They go to the person in the kingdom who had magic THE WHOLE TIME and she at least tells them that they are stupid and this happening. Deal with it. 7) The tedious, boring story is finally ended by Lirazel asking her father to give up all his magic so she can go back to earth. He does and brings the magic to earth, so that her son can go on happily killing unicorns until the end of his days.Did I also mention how over-the-top flowery the language is? Not a bad thing in the right hands, but in this case it just felt ever more tedious. If I read the phrase ""the fields we know"" one more time I was going to throw the book against the wall.Finally (and this is not a criticism of the actual book), even my physical edition of the book was ridiculous. My copy was published in 1977, clearly try to ride on the coattails of the increase in Tolkien's popularity, and the cover shows a pretty elf with perky, hard-nippled breasts walking around a field -- because again, the only thing a female character can do is be pretty or raise children. And I'll spare you the copy on the back of the book (it's a doozy), but it's starts with, in bold, ""Happily NEVER After.""I had to buy the book because it's been out of print for years and not even the SF Public Library carried it. I think the fact that it's no longer is print is probably a good thing. ...more",Notes are private!,0,29,1,"Feb 12, 2014","Feb 21, 2014","Feb 12, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/14686.The_King_of_Elfland_s_Daughter

Shanahan believes that our bodies need food more similar to our ancestors - whole foods, minimal processed foods and little sugar, avoiding vegetable oils, and frankly eating more nutrient rich foods like offal and meat on the bone and homemade stocks. She also contends that you should eat more fats like those in nature - like whole milk instead of skim - in moderation, because they are less processed and can provide more nutrients. She also is a big proponent for eating these sorts of foods while pregnant to give a child a nutritional leg up. But some of her other ideas I found at best lacking enough scientific evidence, and at worst kind of preposterous. She believes that doing all of these things will make you produce a more beautiful child with more symmetrical features, straight teeth, high cheek bones - and they won't ever get chronic diseases. Basically the answer to all your problems in life seem to come from this way of eating, and I just need well researched scientific data to believe it. Her best ideas have solid research to back them up, and I put them in the 'can't hurt, might help' category that I am totally up for trying.

I read about 100 pages and couldn’t get into it and put it down for another day. I’ve met at least three other friends who are around the same age who did the exact same thing. Looking at the book now, 12 years later, I think I needed to be older in order to fully appreciate this incredible, incredible novel. 12 years ago I had never been to Prague or even New York City, and didn’t know what a golem was. Now, having been to these places and living on the East Coast for two years )and being in NYC at least once a week for work or fun), it’s a city that feels a bit like home to me. And this book is a love letter to New York, to be sure, as well as to the romance and power of comics, graphic novels, the written word, and any form of art that lets you express yourself and work out your demons and who you are. It’s interesting that Kavalier and Clay was published in 2000, before September 11. In a weird way I could see this book being written as a response to 9/11.Long story short, I haven’t loved a book like I love this book in a long time. It’s wonderfully written, well-paced, well developed, well-researched, alternately funny and gut-wrenchingly heartbreaking – it really is genius and deserving of the Pulitzer Prize. The relationships between every character felt plausible and real, especially between the three protagonists Joe Kavalier, his cousin Sam Clay, and the love of Joe’s life, Rosa Saxs. And even the comic book characters and story lines that Kavalier and Clay come up (genius stories-within-a story) are great and completely believable as comic book tales of the 1930s and 1940s. I’m half surprised Chabon hasn’t created graphic novels of the Escapist and the Luna Moth (two of the comics featured in the story) since publishing K&C. I’ll admit that this book contained numerous slam-dunk plot points that were probably going to make me enjoy it no matter what: magic, comic book tales of adventure and escape, WWII, a Jewish boy in New York, and love. But Chabon manages to elevate the story, making it feel like something worthy of big titles like “the great American novel.” He’s too clever by half, and if I noted all the moments where I reflected on how incredibly talented he is while reading the book, we’d be here all night. It’s his masterpiece. He may write other great novels, but it’s hard for me to imagine that anything could be more fulfilling than Kavalier and Clay. As I got to the end, after 650 pages, I genuinely didn’t want it to end. And maybe that is the highest praise of all....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jul 19, 2013","Aug 12, 2013","Jul 19, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3985.The_Amazing_Adventures_of_Kavalier_Clay

Lustig has been one of the I first heard Dr. Lustig, a UCSF physician/researcher, on our local NPR station, and he got me intrigued to read his book. Lustig has been one of the most vocal critics of added sugar and processed food, and what he seeks to do in this book is explain how our bodies process and metabolize sugar, and how our increased consumption over the past 30 years has contributed to the obesity epidemic worldwide. To be clear, he only criticizes added sugar, not naturally occurring sugar in fruits, vegetables, and milk, particularly because eating fruits and vegetables gives you the benefit of fiber. And that's really what the moral of his story is: eat lots more fiber, eat far less added sugar and processed food, and don't drink your calories (via soda, juice, sweetened beverages, etc). He talks about the various diets popular over the past 30 years and why they have (or haven't) worked, and what, purely from a health perspective (and not a weight-loss perspective) will help you combat chronic diseases. And that's one of the things I liked about the book -- he isn't selling a weight-loss diet at the end; he's just trying to educate the lay person on the complex biology of how our body processes food, and that 'a calorie is not a calorie.' He discusses the role of physical activity, genetics, etc, and he does a fairly scathing indictment on our food policies today, and a lot of it is things you've heard before. But he really has written a manifesto on things you can change in your diet to make you healthier (though perhaps not thinner) to combat diseases like cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. And sadly, he explains from an evolutionary perspective why the fat on your thighs and hips is so freaking hard to lose.My one criticism is that his writing style can be obnoxious from time to time (if you know a high-level doctor, well, you know the personality I speak of). It might put some people off, but if you ignore that and really just read the pure scientific facts, I think it's a super worthwhile read....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jun 12, 2013","Jun 25, 2013","Jun 12, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/14481524-fat-chance

The premise of the novel is kind of funny: working in the theatre in 1930s Berlin, the main character finds himself single-mindedly focused on sleeping with a girl from his youth whom he runs into years later and finds that her ugly duckling has now become a swan. He follows her all over the world, in the process just misses any number of terrible things happening in Europe at the time on his desperate quest to get laid by her. It’s an amusing idea but its effectiveness wears thin after about 50 pages. The rest of the book is a jumble of half-genres and I found it to be a mess. First, there isn’t really any teleportation in this book or anything especially sci-fi, in spite of its title (I will admit I only skim book s because I still want to be surprised, so this could be my own damn fault). It’s not a romance or a historical fiction, either, and for a book so focused on getting laid, there’s little of it. And it’s not especially funny. On top of all of this, it moves SUPER slow, which any book that bills itself as a lighthearted comedy sure as hell shouldn’t be. Perhaps if I was a guy who was obsessed with sleeping with this one particular girl and because of this I hadn’t gotten laid in five years, I would find this book absolutely amazing.

In fact, if there is a Mad Men-esque publishing award for the most effective book cover language for book sales, whoever did it for “Little Bee” deserves a medal. I won’t spoil too much of the story for anyone who intends to read it, but this book is DEPRESSING. Which isn’t to say that it isn’t a good story (it is) and one that people should read (particularly those who are less informed about what happens to women in developing countries, and to immigrants coming to the West for asylum). That’s all I will say about the plot. But it hit for me on several of the things I have the hardest time dealing with emotionally, and here I was in one of the most beautiful places on Earth (Iguazu Falls) and it made me want to throw myself over them.

I first met Jacques Pepin when I was a college intern at KQED and they were filming one of his television programs. The entire studio smelled absolutely amazing, and I was allowed to sneak into the filming and watch from the corner. After the taping ended, as was customary, the crew got to come in and eat the delicious food he had made. I hung in the shadows in the back (not being part of the crew), and Jacques Pepin came over and basically poo-pooed any notion of me NOT eating with them. I got to ask him some questions on how he did certain things (like chopping the onion…as some of you know I did not come from a house where my Mom took pleasure in cooking, so all basic cooking skills were essentially foreign to me). He demonstrated for me and answered my questions, and it was only when I was older and I realized just who this charming French man was that I realized what an incredibly special moment I had been granted.In a time when food is practically fetishized on TV and in popular culture but little ‘cooking’ and practical cooking skills are actually taught, Jacques Pepin is one of the exceptions. I have learned SO MUCH from his books and TV programs – real, honest-to-goodness practical skills that I use every day. And he taught me a lot about adapting and improvising recipes, flavors that pair well together, etc, so that I never feel wedded to follow a recipe verbatim. His life story is an impressive one, and his autobiography was an enjoyable read from start to finish. From living through WWII bombings as a child on a farm in Lyon, to being the chef to Charles DeGaulle, and later being Julia Child’s culinary partner in crime, he’s had a remarkable career. The book is called “My Life in the Kitchen,” so I guess I should not be disappointed that the book spends far less time on his personal life. But I was, especially because his family often appears in his cooking shows. In his own way, though, it seemed a bit ‘French’ to guard your private life to some degree, so I guess in the end I accept it.

The funny thing is, the more modern language seemed to strip away some of the poetry. It’s still a remarkable (and epic) piece of literature, but it didn’t seem to have the more lyrical quality I expected. As for the story itself, it is as timeless and heartbreaking now as it was thousands of years ago. It shows all sides of war, and how there are people who love the ‘heroes’ on both sides. Every person is a son, husband, father. When Priam comes to Achilles and begs him to return Hector’s body, kissing Achilles hands and telling him that no father has ever had to kiss the hands of the man who killed his children, it’s still devastating.

As I finished it, with tears streaming down my face, I was grateful that I finished it while at home, and not on public transit (hence avoiding being THAT WEEPING GIRL on the bus). Simply put, this is the memoir of Will Schwalbe’s last two years with his mother, a dynamic and remarkable woman who was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2007 and passed away in 2009. Schwalbe was editor in chief at a major publishing house, and books had always been one of the things that they connected on. You may think a book with this story would be depressing, but in fact it’s hopeful and quite beautiful. It highlights the role books play in our lives, the way that they can get us to talk about themes, ideas, philosophies, opinions, and life experiences in a way few other mediums can. Conversations you never thought you would have with someone can stem from discussing a novel. They can bring you closer together and expose to you the soul of the person you are speaking with – and under the circumstances of a terminal cancer diagnosis, they can provide the bridge to some of the more meaningful conversations one can have. In many ways, this book is love letter to the power of the written word.""The End of your Life Book Club"" also touches on the universal themes of love between a parent and child, creating relationships with your parents when you are an adult, caring for those that are ill, friendships from all walks of life, and the impact and legacy you want to have on the world. Mary Anne Schwalbe had a wonderful career and did remarkable things for students and refugees, but to her the greatest achievement of her life were her children, grandchildren, and 40+ year marriage. They were the legacy she would leave behind.This book also doesn’t shy away from illness and death, which seems to be almost taboo in our culture anymore. In a scene that really struck with me, Mary Anne has decided to throw a medium-sized birthday party for herself, a year and a half into her pancreatic cancer diagnosis. People kept asking her if it was a good idea – ""Won’t it tire you out? Are you physically up to it?"" – and she just smiled and said “This is my last birthday party.” She didn’t say it in a sad or angry way, but rather decided that she was going to have a wonderful time surrounded by the people she cared about. She couldn’t change the cancer, but she could embrace that night as one of the most special of her life. I guess I hope that if I were dying of cancer and knew this would be my last birthday, I would do the same. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Nov 29, 2012","Dec 06, 2012","Nov 29, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13414676-the-end-of-your-life-book-club

And that Ian Fleming and others were a part of it, too? Man, this is my JAM.But unfortunately, if you’re expecting Bond-ian levels of espionage and intrigue, don’t read this book. The reality is that we don’t really know much at all about what Dahl actually did during the war, other than he worked for British intelligence and was in charge of pushing pro-British propaganda and spinning stories that would make Americans consider entering into another world war. Dahl was a RAF pilot, that much is true, and he did technically get injured in a plane crash while in service, but the reality is that he crashed his plane because it was a model he wasn’t familiar with – not because he was in enemy combat. Being the great writer we all know him to be, he spun a great tale super loosely based on the truth, and he became a successful propagandist for the war. If this is a book about anything, it’s about the use of propaganda and spin during the war.It’s also painfully slow and often boring. Conant name-drops at least 200 people who are impossible to keep straight and she does little to remind you of who someone is from time to time if she already told you who they are 100 pages ago. And lastly, I stopped counting at the fifth grammatical/spelling typo in the book. Call me crazy, but if you’re writing a non-fiction book where you are intending to show me a long-hidden truth, it becomes harder for me to believe in you when you or your editors have seemingly little eye for accuracy or attention to detail. The fact that Dahl worked for British intelligence during WWII is an interesting factoid.

She's a great storyteller -- you can sit down with one of her books and get immediately sucked in, reading 50 pages in a sitting and not realizing you've done so because she didn't do it with gimmicks or little end of chapter hooks. She also has a fantastic ear for voices, and in turn creates solid, well-formed characters that are completely distinct from one another.""State of Wonder"" is the tale of Marina Singh, a 40-something Minneapolis doctor working at a pharmaceutical company who learns that her friend and longtime office mate has died while trying to get some information about one of the company's drug development projects in the Amazon. Marina reluctantly goes to Brazil to get an idea of what happened to him, to get some closure for her and his family, and to learn more about the secret project. That's all I'll give away about it, but the novel delves into some interesting ethical questions about the role of medicine, a Westerner's role amongst indigenous people, and a lot more. It's an intelligent and engaging read, and yet also perfect to read on a beach. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Aug 13, 2012","Aug 21, 2012","Aug 13, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9118135-state-of-wonder

I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but it strikes me odd that someone would devote their life to learning the in's and out's of how someone else lived their life...all the while not really building up a life of their own. This put me at odds with the protoganists of ""Possession,"" two perfectly fine but bland academics who minutely research the lives and writings of two Victorian poets. The poets themselves were also perfectly fine but not especially likable. In fact, none of the four principal protaganists are people I liked very much. I don't have to like them, but I do have to care about them. And I had a hard time doing it over the course of this 600-page novel.On a technical level, you can see why Byatt won the Booker Prize for the novel. She does a tremendous job creating two authentic Victorian poets -- writing 'their' poetry, their short stories, all of it -- in addition to creating the two modern day academics who uncover the previously unknown connection between the two poets. It's believable, and Byatt is talented. And the novel does evoke much of Victorian romanticism. But while I can appreciate the technical skill used to create the novel, I can't say I took much pleasure reading it. I just wasn't invested in any of these characters, or the 'villains.' I can see how Byatt is trying to show the struggle of a Victorian woman trying to be financially independent and having a literary career of her own, but still... it just didn't do it for me. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jun 15, 2012","Jun 30, 2012","Jun 15, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/41219.Possession

This is a much longer  than I typically write, but it’s a book that deserves more in-depth discussion. I think it comes as no surprise to anyone who knows me that I’m the target audience for this book – urban Bay Area foodie, curious to learn more about the environmental and public health costs of our typical food decisions. I’d read “Fast Food Nation,” seen documentaries like “King Corn.” I thought I ‘got’ it. But I was really surprised by how many more things this book made me think about while I was reading it. The book is divided into four parts, which I won’t go into great detail on, but rather just focus on a few of the most thought-provoking parts to me. The first section details the journey that mass-scale corn and beef make from the production plant to the table. Again, much of this was discussed in “King Corn,” but what Pollan does so well is connect the dots for people like me who never really saw the direct relationship between seemingly disparate facts. Case in point: I never knew that the rumens of cows technically can’t process corn. I feel stupid saying that, but hey, I’m a girl from San Diego who only ever saw a cow in real life if it was winning a prize at the Del Mar Fair. Because cows cannot naturally process corn (which they are fed because we produce it so prodigiously, and subsidize the price at the expense of the farmer, who can barely make a living), and because they live packed together, knee deep in manure, cows are fed a heavy diet of antibiotics. For the past ten years, the medical field has been dealing with increasing occurrences of drug-resistant infections – meaning that people have developed a resistance to life-saving drugs because they have been overexposed to or have misused antibiotics. It’s a subject I’m keenly interested in – in another life I might have been an epidemiologist – but I have to wonder if consumption of animals (chickens and pork too) that are heavily fed antibiotics is a contributing factor to this marked (and scary) increase. I never connected the two together before this book. Pollan also delves into the huge increase in food-borne illnesses and deaths since 1980. Again, those who know me know that I have had severe food poisoning three times, and I have had to be hospitalized the past two times. Those two hospitalizations came not from tainted beef or meat, but from spinach/lettuce. In fact, the last food poisoning (in January 2010) was so serious, and the bacteria so toxic, that if I had been living even 50 years earlier it would have killed me. But then again, if I had been living 50 years ago, there wouldn’t be a food industry system in place that would have made this sort of bacterial contamination happen. I came out of these experiences saying I would only eat organic lettuce from now on, and that I would think twice about ordering a salad when eating out unless it was organic. I kept my blinders on and didn’t really feel compelled to look further into where or what I eat. This book really changed all of that.Since I’ve already written a short novel, I will try to sum up things as best I can. Pollan’s chapter about organics on a large and small scale is fascinating and worth a read, as well as his sections on foraging and hunting. I came out of the book with a much deeper understanding of what I eat, and the costs associated with it. While the cost at the grocery checkout might be less for certain non-organic items, there is a far greater social cost behind that dollar amount for many mass-scale products. His basic motto: eat organic and grass fed when you can, as local and in season as possible. Support local farmers if you can. I’ve heard that said before, but it really makes sense now. I also realize that motto equates to a higher grocery bill, and I’ve made the decision that I will spend that extra amount when I have the choice between organic and non-organic. If it means I spend $25-$50 less on drinks or eating out each month in order to pay for the increased grocery bill, for example, so be it. But I also realize that not everyone can afford to make this same decision, and so does Pollan. He doesn’t preach or stuff things down your thought, which I really appreciated. He ‘gets’ it. He tries to offer reasonable solutions for the vast majority of people, and just wants to help shed light on lifestyle changes that could result in a healthier population. I’m leaving out a ton of other great information from the book, but all I can say is that it’s worth reading if you’re interested in your personal health, the economic and public health of your communities, and where your food comes from. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Mar 16, 2012",not set,"Mar 16, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3109.The_Omnivore_s_Dilemma

It took me about 100 pages to really get into the book, and during that time I was seriously considering if I had hit my limit on dystopic sci-fi portayals of the future. But I kept going, and I'm so glad I did. I realize now that Bacigalupi needs about 100 pages to establish the world he's created and the characters in it; once he's done that he interweaves their story lines and the plot extremely well, and it turned into a real page-turner. ""The Wind-up Girl"" makes you think about the implications of genetically modified foods, environmental degradation, technological advances, etc, and creates a world in which some of the ideas being floated around today have come to fruition -- for better or worse. The premise is interesting, but Bacigalupi manages to make the people who occupy this world even more compelling. It's safe to say that many of the characters are not particularly likable, but they are (here's that word again) deftly painted in grey. As a reader you feel conflicted about how you should feel when things do or don't work out for these characters. No one person is clearly a villain...they all, for the most part, lie in the grey. Emiko, the wind-up girl of the title, is the only wholly sympathetic character -- one who evolves to become an example of the 'kick-ass' female protaganists that are making a resurgence right now in fiction. She's a great character, and one that I could see Bacigalupi continuing in a series. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Feb 28, 2012","Mar 08, 2012","Feb 28, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6597651-the-windup-girl

From the minute you read the first page of this novel, you know you are in good hands. Ishiguro makes the voice of the protagonist, Stevens the butler, so clearly defined, and you can immediately imagine him as a character – as a real, live person, actually. You can see him and his every mannerisms fully formed, as you can the other characters in the novel. I don’t often put much weight in the pulled quotes on the front and back of a book, but on my book there was a quote from Salman Rushdie, who called it “a story both beautiful and cruel.” I think that’s the most succinct description I can give for it. It slowly devastates you, as Stevens reflects on his life and on the ‘fine, dignified men’ which he served. I don’t want to give away much of the story, so I’ll leave it at that.

People have been asking me about the book for a while, because the story revolves around an expose of the human trafficking industry (and I used to work in the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime); Larsson gets the facts mostly straight, with a few embellishments. For the most part, people who deal in human trafficking deal in trafficking drugs and/or firearms as well, and that is the bulk of their business. It's less expensive and often less risky to traffick drugs or firearms (unlike people, they don't need to be fed, housed, etc. They also don't talk.). Larsson made it sound like it was the other way around -- sex trafficking was the primary revenue source, and drugs later. But this is a very academic sort of analysis of a pop culture thriller.

In just 108 pages, Wilder creates a beautiful story, complete with interesting, complex characters, and a premise that is as timeless and relevant now as when it was written (and when it takes place). On an ordinary day in Peru in the 1700s, a legendary bridge collapses, and five people fall to their death. A Catholic priest decides to look into their lives and see if they were virtuous or sinners, to try and get an explanation for why God allowed this to happen. Like all of us, each one of the victims was a nuanced and complicated person who didn’t fit neatly and cleanly into one category. Each one had felt pain and given others pain. The story and its message is fantastic and thought-provoking, but I have to also say that the prose is beautiful.

But that’s what Grossman does with The Magicians, which liberally borrows from the Narnia tales and even a bit from Harry Potter. Unfortunately, for me, the comparison was to Grossman’s disadvantage. The premise of the book is great – a smart, awkward teenager (right out of the semi-nerd mold) who is obsessed with childhood fantasy books about Fillory (e.g. Narnia) gets recruited to attend a secret magical university, and in the last portion of the book, actually goes to Fillory. But the premise never really fulfilled its promise for me. Grossman seems to want to make the point that doing magic is tedious, difficult, and not really ‘magical’ at all – it’s sort of like doing a calculus problem set. But in repeatedly stressing this point, he takes the, well, magic, out of the story. The pacing was often slow, the character development could have been stronger, and to be honest, the only characters I had the slightest bit of emotional engagement with were Alice and Eliot (and Eliot only because it seemed like he might have an interesting backstory…which you never learn). Grossman wrote this to be at least a two-part series (the sequel is out now), but I just don’t have any interest in continuing the story with him. I didn’t get the hype.

It’s not the sort of book I’m typically drawn to, but I heard the novelist interviewed on NPR and my interest was piqued. It’s a fictionalized version of the author’s own life and 30-year marriage with his wife Margaret, who passed away from cancer in 2004. It’s billed as a ‘warts and all’ look at a marriage, and Iglesias has the story jump back and forth from when he first met his wife at age 21, to her last weeks as she dies from cancer. It sort of meets in the middle of their life, which even includes his one-year affair with one of his wife’s friends while their first son was young. I guess part of the challenge is that I feel like I’m ing someone’s life, not a novel. I’m in no place to judge someone else’s marriage. As a novel, I found the places that I felt like I wanted more was actually around the affair and its aftermath. Ultimately he decides to stay with his wife because he feels it’s the right thing to do for his son. And over the course of the book you see how deeply he falls in love with his wife once again, but he details little of what made him fall back in love with his wife. He also makes a point of saying that he never told his wife about the affair before she passed – he meant to, but never had the right moment. You wonder if he did her a kindness or not. I thought the two of them were very real people, who even though they lived a life of privilege had the same quirks, flaws, and beautiful qualities that so many of us have. And ultimately the novel is about the fact that he was a man who spent his whole life trying to build a name for himself as a novelist, but the best thing he ever created in his life was his marriage and his two sons – they were the real purpose and accomplishments of his life, and the best thing he will leave behind. Not his career. And I think that’s a theme that resonates with a lot of us. I don’t feel like you need to be married to appreciate this novel – in essence it is a novel about the relationships (romantic, platonic, or familial) that define your life. And it shows how God forsakenly awful cancer is. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,not set,"Sep 28, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6072556-a-happy-marriage

First, on the whole, I loved the trilogy but I don’t think they are young adult (YA). I think the subject matter and the graphicness of them are not YA, and the only reason that they were classified as YA is because it gives Collins license to use the same plot devices in all three books. Again, I won’t get into specifics, but there is one plot element that is amazing in the first novel; when it appeared again in the second novel I thought “Huh. Well, ok, I guess she found a way to bring it back again.” When it happened in the third novel, I almost got angry. It felt lazy to me, but in a YA book it’s more acceptable. But these books are for adults – I’m not being provincial here. They really are. And in the last 100 pages of the book I got really frustrated. Collins tries to now overtly make the point that the series has been all about the effects of war on children, but in ways she glamorized some of the components of war, but later keeps saying “But wait, it’s bad.” Her whole message got muddled. All of this being said, I flew through the trilogy and really, really enjoyed it. I realize I’m holding her up to a high standard. But just like a teacher expects a certain level of work from a highly proficient student (unfairly, perhaps), I thought the final book was a B-level effort. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,not set,"Sep 28, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7260188-mockingjay

Actually, I do know. I’ve never read a celebrity autobiography before, and I’m not entirely sure what possessed me to pick Russell Brand as my first. Actually, I do know. It was a  of it I read in the NYT a while back that was uncharacteristically positive, and when I started seeing all these ps for Russell Brand movies lately I decided to pick it up from the library on a lark.Putting aside the fact that very few people should be writing autobiographies about themselves when they are only 30, on the whole it’s a so-so book. The book’s subtitle says that is a memoir of sex, drugs, and stand-up. By my count, it was mainly 5% standup, 20% sex addiction (and this is not sexy reading – it merely states that he slept with a bevy of women at this place and that place, etc), and 75% drug addiction. The drug addiction fueled the sex addiction, and the reason so little of the stand-up is covered is because Brand was so wasted while doing stand-up that he can’t really remember much of what happened. He seems like a lot of intelligent, gifted comedians who have a dark side that has been self-medicated through life with alcohol, drugs, etc. I guess that Brand should be given credit for writing such an honest assessment of himself – in short he recounts just how much of a jerk he was for most of his life to everyone in his life, because of his numerous addictions. But I almost think he did too good of a job – he just kept coming off as a jerk, and he became decreasingly likable. By the end of the book (2006, I think) he seems to have redeemed himself, and having cleaned himself he is just about to branch out into international stardom (“Forgetting Sarah Marshall,” “Get to the Him to the Greek,” etc).My other issue with the book is that the areas that I found to be the most interesting – how he got clean, his true low points as an addict, how he makes amends to the ones he loves – are sort of breezed through and skimmed over in the last chapter of the book. Maybe the average reader is more interested in the outrageous antics and over-the-top stuff that happened when Brand was high, but I thought the parts with the real humanity in there were far more interesting – and too few and far between. The other thing, which isn’t his fault, is that he continually references British pop culture and British actors that I’ve never heard of – it probably would be a lot more enjoyable a read if I knew who these people were and had a knowledge of the events to which he was referring. Not a criticism of him, really, but it did affect how much I enjoyed the book. I caught a little bit of Brand on TV on Friday, when he was co-hosting “Regis and Kelly” with Kelly Ripa. He was intelligent, very quick and witty, and exactly how I’ve enjoyed seeing him before. I sort of want to forget this book and only think of him as that very funny, very gifted comedian. Sometimes it’s better to not know the darker side of someone. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Mar 31, 2011",not set,"Mar 31, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2063563.My_Booky_Wook

It definitelIn hindsight, reading “The Road” immediately after the Japan earthquake, and during two solid weeks of rain, probably wasn’t a good idea. It definitely got to me. There was one moment in the book – a small moment, one that no one else would probably even remember – that really got to my head. The father has a flashback of the moments after the apocalyptic event occurs. The father immediately goes into the bathroom and starts filling the bathtub up with water. His wife asks him why he is taking a bath, and he tells her he isn’t. It’s a tiny moment that hit me hard because immediately filling up your bathtub with water is something they teach you to do after a big earthquake – you do it so that you have clean, potable water to drink in case the water pipes burst, get contaminated, or just shut off. It’s the sort of thing you do to have control over an uncontrollable situation, and to make you feel like you’re going to get through this event and be just fine. It’s a flashback from many years before, and you see where his life has gone since then, and what he has suffered and lost since that moment. I thought the story was beautiful, and whereas I didn’t care for McCarthy’s sparse prose in “All the Pretty Horses,” his writing style made sense in this post-apocalyptic story. There were moments between the father and son that just ripped my heart out. Someone asked me why I would want to read a book that is so bleak and depressing, and it’s hard to describe, because while I wouldn’t call it a happy book, it’s a tremendously moving one, and in a way, the ending is about the happiest you’re going to get from Cormac McCarthy. There are many lessons and messages to take away from the story – the unwavering, relentless love between a father and son, the primal savageness that lurks just underneath our surface – but above all I think that McCarthy’s created a book that is a metaphor for life. Faced with even insurmountable circumstances, and no hope on the horizon, you have to keep going and keep moving, and always be “one of the good guys.” To be complacent in your life and stop moving and changing will lead to disaster. And be grateful for every day and every minute that you have with the ones you love. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Mar 21, 2011","Mar 27, 2011","Mar 21, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6288.The_Road

It's a beautifully written book that highlights the lives of a dozen or so characters whose stories are interrelated and interwoven with one another around one single event -- Philippe Petit's historic tightrope walk between the Twin Towers in 1974. But the book is only minimally about the tightroping event itself, and more about the people whose lives are changed, directly or indirectly, on that day. Each character was distinct and fully formed, and while there were a couple of characters whose stories I might have omitted (only because I didn't feel like their inclusion really added much to the story), on the whole it is wonderful.

Like the sort of book that makes people on the bus look at you because they can’t understand why you would be laughing while reading a book. I’ll be the first to admit that Vowell’s nerdy and slightly macabre style and wit are right up my alley (a humor book about taking vacations to the various sites around the US dedicated to the assassinations of Presidents Lincoln, Garfield, and McKinley? Sign me up!). Like her, I can’t walk past a plaque on a building and not feel compelled to read it. I like the feeling of knowing that something significant happened right where I am standing, and trying to envision that place and moment when it happened. And Vowell does a great job of mixing history with funny anecdotes about the journey of exploring these various places, making someone with only a small amount of interest in presidential assassinations find the book to be fascinating, funny, and gosh darn it, educational, too!The other strength of Vowell’s writing is the warmth she exudes when talking about the people she meets, this nation, and about her own family. One sentence that really struck me was about her two-week “assassination vacation” trip with her twin sister Amy and Amy’s three year-old son Owen. The fact that her sister agreed to be the driver/chauffeur for this bizarre trip (with her three year-old in tow) speaks volumes about how much she loves her sister Sarah, and their interactions also reflect the love that you can have for your siblings and family – you want to be a part of something just because you know how happy it makes them. And one of my favorite lines goes something like this: “While I am never surprised by how much I love my nephew Owen, I am continue to be pleasantly surprised by how much I like him.” Which is to say that you will always love your family, but when you find that even if you weren’t related to someone you’d still like them anyway, that’s saying something. Along these lines, when Vowell meets the colorful cast of characters who run these historic monuments, off-the-beaten path pilgrimage sites, etc, she portrays them with a humanity and warmth that a lesser writer couldn’t do, because they would be tempted to make fun of them. It’s a quick read (250 pages, large-ish font), and if you have any interest in history, or just like the humorists on “This American Life,” I’d highly recommend “Assassination Vacation.”...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Feb 23, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3110.Assassination_Vacation

For Pete’s sake, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was instrumental in getting them translated into English, and you know how I love Jackie O! But I find that I can’t get into them as much as I would like. This book picks up with Al-Hamzawi five years after the end of the first book, and the characters are dealing with the passage of time and the loss of one of the young family members. In this book I found the mother Amina to be a far more compelling character, the image of a woman who has been subservient her entire life, but now that she has had to bury one of her children far too soon, she can no longer keep her emotions in check. She yells, she gets angry, she cries – in short, she gets a backbone. It’s refreshing, because the women in Mahfouz’s books continue to be the most sympathetic characters for me. The book took a strange telenovela-inspired turn when it comes to the sexual relationships and affairs of the men in the family. The father, getting older, begins to lust after the young lute player Zanuba, the niece of Zabayda, one of his long-time mistresses. He doesn’t know that Zanuba used to be sleeping with his son Yasin, and when Zanuba sees that she can be a ‘kept woman’ with the father she doesn’t exactly offer up this information, either. The son Yasin, for his part, lusts after the woman whom his late brother Fahmy was in love with, Maryam, and resigns himself to marrying her when he realizes that this is the only way he will bed her. And then he proceeds to have an affair with Zanuba the lute player – that’s right, the same one who is sleeping with his father. Zanuba ultimately splits with the father, and Yasin divorces Maryam and marries Zanuba. Yasin never knows that his wife use to sleep with his father, but the father obviously knows the secret when his son secretly weds Zanuba. Still following me? It’s basically one incestuous pool of infidelity, which is completely at odds with the pious life of Islam to which the men say they ascribe. And it continues the dichotomy of woman as saint and woman as whore.The most refreshing part of this book is that the child Kamil of book 1 is now an 18-year old man in “Palace Walk,” and he shows in heartwrenching detail what it feels like to have your heart broken for the very first time. It is actually his story line in “Palace Walk” that will make me continue to finish the trilogy. I feel like I can admire Mahfouz from a technical perspective, because he is a good writer (like Dickens), but the books just feel a bit ponderous. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jan 27, 2011",not set,"Jan 27, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5495.Palace_of_Desire

I enjoyed the magical realism employed throughout, and there are moments of pure poetry in the book. In fact, the very first line of the book might be my favorite opening line to a book, EVER. (Quick aside: Marquez’s first line rivals Ernest Hemingway’s famed “shortest story,” which was created when members of the Algonquin Round Table made a bet that no one could write a complete story with a beginning, middle, and end in six words or less. Hemingway scribbled on the back of a cocktail napkin: “For sale. Baby shoes. Never worn.” Each member of the Round Table proceeded to cough up $10 to Hemingway, knowing he had achieved what none of them could.)I alternated between really loving this book and feeling like it dragged – in those parts in particular I think I would have benefitted from having a discussion group with whom I could have dissected things. I often felt like I wasn’t reading it with the depth it really deserves. I could definitely see how Marquez has influenced so many writers with his use of magical realism, and he really does it best.

I could barely remember any of the little history I learned about Egypt in the past thousand years or so. So I borrowed Mahfouz’s “Cairo Trilogy,” which won the Nobel Prize, in the hopes of informing my knowledge of more modern Egypt. I’m not going to lie. This wasn’t an easy book for me. In the best and worst sense, it reminds me of Dickens – beautifully written, intelligent, and often very, very slow. It also pushed my own culturally relative limits. At times, I couldn’t tell if the author though that the treatment towards the female protagonists was appropriate or abusive, and tried as I might to be non-judgmental, I thought the relationships toward many of the women were abusive. And they highlighted the eternal struggle of woman as saint or whore. A man wants his wife to be virginal and pure, the saintly mother of his children, following all of God’s credos, but the man must also have women on the side with whom he has multiple affairs, breaking numerous laws in the Koran while he goes home and throws out his wife for leaving the house for the first time EVER in 20+ years, only because she wanted to pray at the mosque. It was frustrating and challenging to read, but if anything, the fact that it got me so riled up shows how much I started to get wrapped up in these characters. Up until the last 50 pages, I thought I wouldn’t go through with finishing the Trilogy. But enough happened in those last pages for me to think that I’ll continue with books 2 and 3 before heading to Egypt. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Oct 08, 2010","Nov 17, 2010","Oct 08, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/762134.Palace_Walk

But I’ve been told that the TV series diverges pretty significantly from the books in many ways, so I’m giving them a go.I’ll say that when I started this book, I wasn’t sure if I was going stick with it. The book jacket description of the story and series is trite and awful, and the first chapter or two are a little rough. And style-wise, the writing isn’t particularly remarkable. But once you get through that, this first novel is immensely entertaining and surprisingly funny. Literally the perfect summer read, as I flew through the book and had a lot of fun doing so. I will say that the thing that struck me most about the books (and isn’t really a critique of the books, but rather, the TV show) is that “True Blood” creator Alan Ball did a damn fine job of casting people based on their descriptions in the book. Sure, Tara wasn’t even in this book, and apparently when she does appear she isn’t black, but who cares? I was struck by how even minor characters in the books were brought to the screen almost verbatim from the book. I salute you, Alan Ball!Fans of “True Blood” will be disappointed to know that all the things that make it an HBO show – namely, the language, sex, and violence – are not as explicit in the book, but the books definitely don’t shy away from these areas, either. And yes, my beloved Lafayette is short-lived in the book series – thank God Alan Ball had the good sense to rewrite the TV series to make Lafayette an integral (and living) character. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jul 15, 2010","Jul 21, 2010","Jul 15, 2010",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/301082.Dead_Until_Dark

Munro’s writing style is clean, even sparse at times, but she has an ability to pack a mean emotional punch. I’ve heard it said that her stories illuminate the extraordinary in the ordinary lives of people, and it’s a fair depiction of her style. The stories in this collection range in era from the 1930s to the 1970s, and they primarily focus on the lives of rural or isolated people in Canada. I must say that throughout the earlier stories, the phrase “leading lives of quiet desperation” constantly came to mind. So did the music of Neko Case, for that matter (“Fox Confessor Brings the Flood” would be the perfect audio barbiturate for a reading session). One thing that sets Munro apart for me is her decision to write several short stories about the same protagonist. Each story highlights the character at different points in her life – almost as if an omniscient being were to look in on a selection of moments in your life (sort of like Rip Torn in “Defending Your Life”). You saw the emotional points the character was at – age 20 and in college, divorced at 43, etc. It made it easier to stay engrossed in the collection, because you really felt like you were starting to get under the skin of a character.There is a distinctly melancholy feel to Munro’s stories – not tragic, but many of the characters were dealing with unhappy points in their life and trying to work their way through them. Whether it was the humiliation of a parent in front of their children in Depression-era Ontario, or dealing with loneliness after a one-night stand that the protagonist hadn’t thought would be a one-night stand, the mood was a somber, reflective, a little sad. Beautifully broken, if you will. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jun 30, 2010","Jul 15, 2010","Jun 30, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/14281.Selected_Stories

Part of Austen’s appeal **spoiler alert** ""Mansfield Park"" has been called Austen’s “most profound and perplexing novel,” and it truly is perplexing. Part of Austen’s appeal to me has always been that she created strong, intelligent female characters who, within the confines of their families and social structures, assert themselves and demonstrate that they have a mind and presence all their own. And then Fanny Price comes along. As protagonist of “Mansfield Park,” she is the anti-Austen heroine. Fanny is the epitome of a wet blanket – weak, timid, with no confidence in herself, and really no personality to speak of. Plucked from her family at the age of 10 and brought to live with her affluent aunt, uncle, and cousins, she is a woman with no clear sense of family and where she belongs, and this certainly does inform her personality. She is thought to be beneath her wealthy cousins, but she no longer fits in with her less advantaged biological family, who just don’t know what to do with her. It may be that because she does not have a strong family model in which to operate, and because she is in many ways rootless, that she cannot be like the other Austen heroines. And that may have been Austen’s point. But the resulting character, and subsequently the novel, creates a world in which you have little emotional investment in the story and its inhabitants. How I wished to have the swelling of heart that I felt when Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet finally unite, or when Eleanor realizes that Mr. Robert Ferrars has been married to Lucy, not the Mr. Edward Ferrars of her heart! But instead, after a 400-page slog through “Mansfield Park,” I learn two pages before the end of the novel that at some point in the future (spoiler alert here) Fanny marries her cousin Edmund, who is basically the only man who has ever been genuinely nice to her. Eww factor aside, the simple fact that Edward has clearly loved Fanny “as a sister” throughout the novel, and in no place do I see where his love moves from filial to romantic, makes the ending completely unsatisfyingPerhaps I am reading too much into it, but “Mansfield Park” strikes me with a bit of bitterness on Austen’s part. As one of her last novels, which she wrote as an older unwed woman, it almost feels like her image of love has changed, and she wonders just how many marriages can be truly based on love. The patched-on nature of the conclusion of “Mansfield Park” seems to suggest this, and her own satire on religion and morality also seem to suggest that she no longer possesses the bright-eyed optimism of her youth. I think I’ll stick with her earlier novels from now on. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"May 20, 2010","Jun 08, 2010","May 20, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/45032.Mansfield_Park

I was shocked when I read the statistic (I guess showing my limited knowledge of the vast world of adult film), and I thought of it every time Lisbeth said, “Just another man who hates women,” or Larson mentioned another statistic about sexual violence against women in Sweden.

My main criticism of the book was that I felt it delved too much into the overall history of children’s television, and it went into the back history of every single person who ever had any role in the show. It’s wonderful that these individuals finally get more recognition for the roles they played, but I felt like the result was that it covered very little ground on the two individuals I was most interested in: Jim Henson and Frank Oz. Maybe Davis thinks that enough books have been written about these two puppeteers that he should cover the other folks, but come on, how do you have a book about the history of “Sesame Street” and cover so little about the two of them? I wanted backstage stories about how certain characters evolved, funny outtakes, the works. I guess the flip side of that is that I didn’t learn anything about Jim Henson that really upset me or changed my opinion of him, which can be the dangerous thing about biographies of people you like (e.g. “White Christmas” just never felt as moving to me after I found out that Bing Crosby was an alcoholic wife beater).The book is more somber than you might expect, and I came away from it with three lessons:1)	Harvard and Yale really do run the world. I knew it working at Yale, but honestly, the doors that get opened and the connections that get made in the Ivy League really do change things. And “Sesame Street,” at the Executive and writing levels, was populated almost exclusively with Ivy Leaguers. 2)	You can’t have your cake and eat it too. The moral of the “Sesame Street” story is that the majority of these folks spent their lives working on this amazing, groundbreaking show that changed children’s education – but often at the expense of their marriage and/or raising their children. People who might have wanted children never had the opportunity to do so because they worked all the time; people who did have children never saw them because, ironically, they were busy creating children’s educational programming for the world’s children; and often you could be married to “Sesame Street” or to your spouse, but you couldn’t do both. 3)	It appears that working on “Sesame Street” took an enormous physical toll on its staff, and an inordinate amount of them died very young (under the age of 65). The last two chapters are basically a eulogy for the majority of the show’s core team, who all died prematurely of cancer, ALS, AIDS, depression, cardiac arrest, and pneumonia. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Apr 27, 2010","May 04, 2010","Apr 27, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3111697-street-gang

I knew so little about the novel before picking it up -- basically all I knew was that it didn’t exactly end well for Anna. But in many ways I felt the most compelling parts of AK were not at all about her; rather, the storyline of the Levins felt far more authentic and real to me. To be sure, Tolstoy writes Anna with a great deal more sympathy than most male authors of his period would have. But I felt that his description of the love affair between Anna and Vronsky was one of the weakest points of the novel – apart from the fact that she’s beautiful, and he’s beautiful, I didn’t see what drew them to each other, and beyond that what really kept them together. In stark contrast to that was the love affair between Kitty and Levin, which felt genuine and alive – when they fell in love, I knew why.For me, Tolstoy’s greatest achievements were in the little vignettes about the relationships and moments that define our lives: the courtship and confession of love between Kitty and Levin, Anna’s visiting of her son on his birthday, Levin’s anxieties about his pregnant wife and their unborn child, and even Alexey Alexandrovitch’s behavior when confronted with the fact that his wife no longer loves him. Tolstoy is masterful at creating shades of grey, and showing characters at their best, at their worst, and how most of us, most of the time, fall somewhere in between. Even if I didn’t agree with a character’s actions, I often understood their position and why they acted the way they did. That a book published 140 years ago still feels timely and relevant today is a testament to Tolstoy.Sure, the fact that every character seemed to blush or flush at the slightest thing felt Victorian and a bit dated. The wild flashes of jealousy that seem to possess each character at one point or another feel, a little, well, Russian. And by the end Anna was starting to annoy me so much that I was beginning to look forward to her tragic end. But I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this book, and how a novel that was 900 pages long didn’t feel as laborious as I expected. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Mar 22, 2010","Apr 27, 2010","Mar 22, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/110913.Anna_Karenina

I even took a class on Dutch Literature of the Holocaust in college “just for fun,” which I guess can be classified as both nerdy and a bit morbid. And then I married someone whose maternal grandparents were Holocaust survivors (not intentionally, obviously). I sometimes wonder if there are just certain themes and subjects that the universe has decided are going to play a part in your life, and for me, the Holocaust and World War II seem to play a recurring role.

Without it being based on someone’s real life, the story would fall flat for me, and it would feel like it’s trying too hard to hit the most extreme range of emotions. Benioff is a screenwriter by trade (something I did not know before I started the book), and the novel does seem to read like a movie at times…not quite like a screenplay, but you can easily see it being made into a movie (which Benioff is probably hoping for).

Call it morbid curiosity, buIt’s hard not to read this book without the knowledge of Wallace’s tragic suicide informing your impressions of the book. Call it morbid curiosity, but you find yourself unconsciously reading passages differently than you would if he were still alive. For example, in his analysis of Doestoevsky, he refers to “the unbelievably repellant Smerdyakov, that living engine of slimy resentment in whom I personally see parts of myself I can barely stand to look at.” It’s a passage you wouldn’t think twice about if read while the author is still living, but reading it after his depression-related suicide brings an unexpected sadness to an essay that is not meant to be sad (it is in fact a celebration of Doestoevsky, and because of the essay I’m willing to give Doestoevsky another go).Wallace is an immensely talented writer, and clearly a genius -- not a term I use often or throw around lightly. He is one of the most erudite writers I’ve ever read, and yet he still manages to keep the reader engaged, even when the subject is something as dry as an 80-page essay on the politics of the Dictionary of Modern English Usage. It won’t appeal to everyone (admittedly, its targeted demographic are those most ardent supporters of NPR’s ""A Way With Words""), and he will challenge you as a reader (more on that to come), but I feel like a better reader for it. Wallace’s style is frenetic and tangential, often employing many, many footnotes, or the flat-out scattering of boxed “asides” all over the page. It can be frustrating because it makes the reading experience feel scattered, but I think that is his intended purpose (if you’ll indulge me for a Wallace-esque aside, Wallace reminds me of that kid you knew growing up who was SO smart, awkwardly smart, maybe even too smart for his own good. That kid for me was Hubert W., who ended up going to Cal with me and about four other classmates, and I never once saw him on campus in my whole four years there. Hubert today is either working on the cure for cancer or planning the destruction of us all – there really isn’t anything in between). Truthfully, one could easily do a full critique on each of the essays in this collection. His shortest essay, about experiencing 9/11 while in Bloomington, IN, was to me the most impactful of all his writings. It could have been the noticeable absence of his beloved footnotes, or the subject matter, but it was truthful and earnest in a way you don’t come to expect from someone like Wallace. I was also struck by the fact that Wallace was a church-going man of faith – again, not something you necessarily expect from a sardonic, left-leaning novelist/journalist in the 21st century. It was oddly refreshing. His essay following John McCain on the 2000 campaign trail is another gem, and the others are all interesting, albeit sometimes long (Wallace did need an editor). It’s enough to make me seriously consider undertaking his tome and masterpiece, ""Infinite Jest.""

I literally knew nothing about the book, and I secretly hoped for the anthropomorphizing of some small woodland creatures ala “Watership Down.” Alas, “Rabbit Run” is about a man named Harry, nicknamed “Rabbit” for his pale skin and twitchy demeanor. I went on such an emotional rollercoaster with this book, alternating between moments of passionate hate for the protagonist, and then my heart literally aching for the characters. Make no mistake, to my mind Rabbit is an arrogant, conceited, self-absorbed, misogynistic pig. I haven’t been so passionately antagonistic towards a character in recent memory. But he is still human, and there are moments in which I felt genuine sympathy for him. It struck me somewhere along the way that if I was getting this riled up about a character, borderline hating him, and then in turns feel such strong emotion toward the other characters, it had to be good. The turning point of the novel, read on my commute into work, haunted me all day. Rather than approaching the novel as Rabbit being a character I’m supposed to like, I came to feel that the novel is about the destruction and devastation that Rabbit causes in the lives around him. And then I realized that a book I had basically hated for the first 100 pages was turning into a book that really stuck with me, and hit me on a deep emotional level. This also must be on the best books for book club discussion I have ever read. I dog-eared no less than 20 pages with topics and ideas for conversation. It’s a book I want to discuss with people, to debate about, reflect upon. UPDATE: Randomly, the collection of short stories I am reading by David Foster Wallace includes a hilarious essay/criticism of John Updike, one of the premiere narcissistic men of the 1960s. In one sentence I think he encapsulated so much of Updike. He writes, in referring to the traditional Updike protagonist, ""It never once occurs to him, though, that the reason he's so unhappy is that he's an asshole....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Feb 02, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/85386.Rabbit_Run

Sure, it ties up too neat and tidy at times, and sometimes it is just plain ridiculous or skirts out of dangerous literary territory far too quickly, but he deserves credit for making a time travel novel that doesn't completely lose the reader.

And the strong themes about being a Jew in Vienna at the rise of anti-semitism resonated very close to home, given my in-laws family history in Vienna.

I loved the story until the last chapter, which, like Bel Canto, felt a little rushed and trying to tie up the ends too quickly.

I didn't have much for this book, and I was so pleasantly, wonderfully surprised by how entertaining it was. First, when Julie Andrews writes, you can hear her saying the words -- she has a wonderfully authentic voice. The book focuses on her life before super stardom (in fact, it ends as she is about to go onto the ""Mary Poppins"" set), and really is about her childhood (tougher than you'd expect) and growing up on the vaudeville circuit in wartime London, and then her move to America to originate the roles of Eliza Doolittle in ""My Fair Lady"" and Queen Guinevere in ""Camelot."" The people who are ""characters"" in her book are the Broadway icons of today -- Rodgers, Hammerstein, Sondheim, Bernstein, etc. And just like her, they were trying to make it, and weren't the legends we see them as now. If you're at all interested in the history of Broadway or vaudeville, it's a great summer read.

This collectioThis anthology overall was an immense disappointment, and I think much of the blame lies on the shoulders of the editor, Susan Orleans. This collection was so hit and miss (mostly miss), that I questioned her judgment for being to tell a good story from a bad one. At the root of my disappointment is my struggle with the question, “What is a travel essay?” If you left your couch and wrote about it, does that qualify as a travel essay? Or what about a piece on the legislative process of making a tiny protectorate island a nation? Because it takes place in a country outside of the United States, despite having nothing to do with traveling, does that make it a travel essay?Many of the selections in the anthology belonged in Time or Newsweek -- they were not essays, but rather pieces for Time or Newsweek that were too long to print, so they ended up in this book. Other efforts felt phoned in – Ann Patchett, an author I greatly enjoy, wrote an entertaining but amazingly brief piece (three pages) that ended before it began. Jonathan Stern’s piece on “The Lonely Planet Guide to My Apartment” felt contrived and smug, and not nearly as entertaining as the name suggested.That being said, there were a handful of essays that were real gems – those included David Rakoff’s piece on Hollywood Blvd, Steve Friedman’s essay on a 410-pound man walking across America to find happiness, and the one of the best short stories I have read in years: “The Incredible Buddha Boy,” by George Saunders. It was the only story of the whole anthology that I couldn’t put down. A writer for GQ, I hope Saunders will consider publishing his own collection of short stories in the future. Saunders understood what (to me) makes a great travel story – insight, wit, respect for the culture/country that you are visiting, and a sense for making the reader feel that they are experiencing it with you.

While Kipling's novel begins with the murder of Mowgli's family (and infant Mowgli's deposit by his mother into the jungle), Gaiman's protagonist -- later named ""Bod,"" short for ""Nobody"" -- escapes a similar situation, when his family is brutally killed, and he toddles his way into the local graveyard. Bod then spends his childhood raised by ghosts, spirits, and the undead of the graveyard, and finding himself in adventures that would make Kipling proud. Gaiman also successfully translates the story to 21st century UK, and manages to make a novel that is both contemporary and timeless (as all fairy tales should be). ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Nov 20, 2008","Oct 24, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2213661.The_Graveyard_Book

And you find out about it, and think to yourself, ""Really? A sequel? Why mess with a good thing?""That, in a nutshell, is how I felt about this book. I felt like the author thought that she needed to create some huge unexpected drama to keep the story going, and the problem is, the drama she creates completely contradicts everything she laid out in the first book. And if you bought into the original story line, you keep telling yourself how stupid this is, and how false the drama feels. The drama that takes up a whopping 400 PAGES of this book takes away from the true relationship at the core of ""Twilight,"" the very thing that made people keep reading. You're then left with the flaws in the book that you sort of overlooked the first time because you liked the story so much. It reminded me a lot of ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"" where you felt like Rowling was bashing you over the head with the fact that Harry is an angry, frustrated teenager (We get it, Rowling). You find yourself becoming irritated with a character you want to be rooting for. And heavens, can someone please give Meyer (and Rowling, for that matter) a real editor? Someone who actually edits things out of a story? I don't need to know that Bella eats a lot of pizza, lasagne, and granola bars. I get it. Let's keep things moving, please.The good thing is that in the last 200 pages, Meyer seems to get her act together, and she lays the groundwork for some interesting storylines, which makes me eager to continue the series. And did anyone read the acknowledgments? Any author who gives a shout-out to the band Muse for inspiring some of her stories is pretty darn nifty to me.

No. But is it the most page-turning book I’ve read in at least a year? Oh gosh, yes. “Twilight” lured me in from the very first chapter, and I read all 500 pages of it in just four days (ok, ok, the font size is slightly bigger than an adult book). Meyer masterfully captures the electric moments of your first love, as well as the awkward social moments that come with the high school territory – with a little vampire action thrown in for extra measure. It’s an interesting premise to work with – girl falls for boy who is secretly a vampire, boy resists girl as long as he can because he loves her and finds her nearly irresistible, and is constantly dealing with the inner demons of wanting to eat her…which would put a damper on the relationship. Read into that what you will, but it’s an interesting way to look at the two sides of passion, and the thin razor’s edge that separates positive and negative passion. The book was also pretty suspenseful, and – dare I say? – sexy. Young adult books weren’t nearly as passionate and seductive when I was younger, but this is a more accurate depiction of passion and raging hormones than what you see in a lot of YA novels.

While Mortenson's story was very uplifting, I ultimately found the whole message hampered by the use of a ghost writer, whose writing style is too journalistic at times, and at other times verges on idolatry. The emotional moments of the book were rendered flat because of the lackluster storytelling of the writer, David Oliver Relin. In truth, when I bought the book, I didn't realize it had a ghost writer. It's such a shame. I realize that because Mortenson is so busy doing the wonderful work that he does, he doesn't have the time to write a book. And the sales of this book will allow CAI to be solidly funded for years to come. But I really struggled with the book, especially the middle section, and only continued reading it out of respect for the work that Mortenson does. To my knowledge, I'm the only member of the book club that did finish it -- the first 50 pages put a lot of people off, which is saying something, given that we are the target demographic for the book (educated do-gooders who believe in the value of education to fight terror).

A memoir of his adult life after having left Zimbabwe, the place of his birth (he is a journalist for National Geographic and a slew of other top-notch publications), Godwin painfully portrays the experience of white Africans in Zimbabwe, and his own family's history in their journey to Africa. It gives an insider's view of Mugabe's reign of terror, and the utter chaos that has enveloped the country.Perhaps the most compelling part of the story is that of his parents, elderly in the late 90s and early 2000s. Anyone who has cared for an aging loved one, and who feels the guilt of the child or grandchild who is no longer at home to care for them, is struck by this emotional theme in the story. Add to this feeling the fact that his aging parents are in a conflict torn country with few resources, wild inflation, and rampant crime and intimidation, and you get a sense of the emotional and moral dilemma Godwin goes through. His parents are rooted in their home country and won't leave, but their children cannot viably stay; indeed, one of Godwin's siblings is a casualty of random violence during the Civil War. Godwin and his remaining sister act as international voices on the crisis, she on the radio, he in print. This is a heartbreaking and riveting book, which can be paired daily with the newspaper to show how so little has changed in Zimbabwe (the book ends in 2004), and how Mugabe's reign of terror last until this day. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Apr 16, 2008","Apr 15, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2538189.When_a_Crocodile_Eats_the_Sun

While I am in no way saying our lives paralleled one another,I had many similar experiences being an, at times, less than welcome foreigner there. For those of you who read my blog, you'd see that she and I had many similar observations about the city -- the Viennese obsession with death, the trials and tribulations of the grocery store, and just simply being from a country that wasn't particularly popular in the world -- and how that frames your experience. Even the neighborhoods she lived in, and the fact that her friend's mother also worked at the UN -- it made the memoir hit a striking note with me. I was a little less satisfied with the ending -- perhaps because Satrapi is still young, and so you know she has so many experiences left to live, and as such it doesn't feel like an ending.

I'm his target audience, and yet he still turned me off. He critiques pop culture at such a level of extreme minutia that only four people on the planet know what he's talking about. Furthermore, he makes a point of saying that certain shows, bands, etc. appeal only to people who were born between certain years (he was born in 1972, and thinks most of today's pop culture only applies to those born between 1970 and 1975). For example, he writes that only people born between the aforementioned years ever watched ""Saved By the Bell,"" which aired when he was in college. I won't get into the fact that Klosterman was watching episodes of SBTB in COLLEGE (mind you, this was a show on Saturday mornings initially, geared towards the 10-15 year-old crowd). In fact, I think SBTB was watched by many more viewers in younger generations than his, but it serves to illustrate the point that Klosterman seems to feel that everything in pop culture only applies to his narrow generational window.He writes as if he thinks he so much better than all of these people he makes fun of, and yet he spends his career hyper-evaluating pop culture.

I think the story of the book and how it came to be is more famous than the actual story. John Kennedy Toole shopped the book around for years, and no one would publish it. He became so depressed he ultimately committed suicide (he was only in his 30s). His mother continued shopping the book around after he died, and finally a publisher agreed to release it. It then went on to win the Pulitzer Prize.The book is completely about character development rather than a moving storyline, and I will say that Ignatius Reilly is one of the most well-crafted and memorable characters I've ever read. He's also not the most likeable, but he's not supposed to be. I almost gave up on the book about 150 pages in because I was so turned off by the character, but I'm glad I stuck with it because he does grow on you a little, and Toole does a great job of weaving all the related storylines together in ingenious ways.

Reading it as an adult, I almost loved it more. It made me realize how much this book shapeThis has always been one of my favorite childhood stories. Reading it as an adult, I almost loved it more. It made me realize how much this book shaped a part of who I am. Growing up, I lived in a house that was on a canyon at the end of the cul-de-sac. You could walk along the canyon’s edge just beyond our house, and there was a small, U-shaped inlet that was full of wild native plants. Pretty much from the first day we moved into that house this little inlet (completely hidden by the hedge on our property line) became my ‘secret garden.’ One of the nicest things my Dad did for me as a child was that he cut a hole in his hedge so that I would have my own private entry into the garden (grown-ups could just use the walking path). I had smaller versions of gardening tools, and I cultivated my own little garden of wildflowers. I kept thinking about this as I reread the book, and thought of the other message that I didn’t necessarily pick up as a child: the message that being active and out of doors is necessary for a child to be healthy and thrive. Basic and obvious, yes, but that message stuck with me more as an adult, as so many of our friends start families and we start thinking about having our own one day. I started thinking about how kids today don’t spend as much time outdoors (I don’t blame them, per se, there are a lot of reasons). And I hoped they would find the magic in the book (and the surprising complex character development) that I found I loved even more as an adult. On the day I finished the book, I had just come in from spending three hours in the backyard of our (new to us) fixer-upper home. I had been pruning our beautiful, mature orange tree that was overhanging onto the neighbor’s yard (and pushing on the back fence to the point that I thought it might break it), as well as pruning our lemon tree, both of which had been neglected for years. It was difficult work – sawing the limbs off with one hand, holding the limb in the other hand so that it didn’t drop in the neighbor’s yard when sawed, only then to have to pull the heavy, fruit-laden branches back over the fence onto our side of the yard. But it felt so good do it, even though I was getting scratched by branches and covered in dust and dirt and insects. I stood on our back porch when it was all done and could see how much better our yard looks. It was so nice to see the results of hard work tangible in front of you. And I thought of the book and hoped that I could instill this same love into our kids some day. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Jun 30, 2007",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2998.The_Secret_Garden

As a work of historical fiction it's top-notch, seemlessly blending the unknown life of a fictional character (Mr. March of Alcott's ""Little Women"") during the Civil War, and the true life stories of individuals of the time. I've never been a Civil War buff (""Gone with the Wind"" has informed much of my Civil War history knowledge sadly), but reading this book has made me contemplate picking up other books of the time period, and Brooks makes some great recommendations in the afterword.Above all this though, I thought Brooke's greatest accomplishment in the book was in portraying the love and relationship between Mr. March and Marmee March -- complex, passionate, and all too imperfect and real. By showing what happens when we try to be what we think the other person wants us to be, and the results of a lack of true communication (all because you love a person too much to want to disappoint them), as well as the gray area between long held ideals and philosophies and the reality you actually encounter, Brooks does a fantastic job of creating a haunting, true-to-life relationship between two people whom you know so little about from Alcott's novel.

I can see why. It's a challenging book, slow in parts, and the subject matter (child abuse, overtones of sexual abuse from a community member) can make it hard to read. Just at the turning point in the novel (around page 300) I almost put the book down, but figured that I've already put the time in to read 300 pages, what's 150 more? I'm glad I did. The story takes an unexpected shift, and while I didn't love it, it made me appreciate it much more.I give Hulme credit because she manages to make Joe, a character who on paper should be hated and despised, someone you can empathize with on some level. Hulme has crafted very real (albeit screwed up) characters whom you feel for, even if you completely disagree with their behavior. A telling sign for me of the emotional impact of the book was when one of the same colleagues said to me, ""You know, I still think about that book. I want to know what happens to the characters."" I did too, and in my eyes that's the sign of a good storyteller. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,Jun 2007,"Jun 19, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/460635.The_Bone_People

My boyfriend's grandparents were both Holocaust survivors who emigrated to the US after the war. The book focuses on one man's search to find out more about 'the lost,' six members of his family (an aunt, uncle, and four cousins) who perished in the war, but no one knows exactly how. He travels to multiple countries over several years interviewing Jews from his family's tiny town in what is now Ukraine. The similarities between this man's family and what I know of the experiences of my boyfriend's family were in many cases eerily and s unsettlingly similar. You have to work at reading this book -- it's nearly 600 pages -- and the subject matter and prose can sometimes make you feel like you're hardly making any headway. It's not a quick read, but by the end you feel an intimacy with the author. You wish you could just call him up and talk to him about his experiences. I think anyone who is interested in the Holocaust, or can appreciate the journey of trying to discover more about your family and your heritage, will enjoy reading this book....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,Feb 2007,"Mar 14, 2007",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/112286.The_Lost
