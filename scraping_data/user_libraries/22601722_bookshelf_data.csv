While always retaining the spirit of the original, he not only gives Jim primacy in the story, but invigorates his narrative, to tell us not only about the past, but our own time as well.There are few writers who are able to both tell a vitally important, deeply felt and relevant story, while cloaking it in such a gripping narrative. Everett has shown, time and again, that he is a master of this.Compelling, harrowing, playful, fiercely intelligent, funny, incredibly moving and hopeful.

One of my books of 2023.The son of a corrupt Russian oligarch is found mutilated and hanging from a building in the Chernobyl exclusion zone. Whilst the Ukrainian police begin their investigation, so does a shady cop from Moscow, a man with a violent history in Chechnya who has been hired by the victim's father to find and execute the killer.But not everything is as it first appears in this abandoned place, where nature is slowly clawing back it's grip, and the rusting relics of the USSR litter the landscape.Not just a brilliant and grisly crime thriller, Good Reasons to Die is also an examination of the politics of modern Ukraine, and a compassionate look at the legacy of trauma still being felt from that fateful Chernobyl night in 1986.Like a Soviet version of Don Winslow's The Power of the Dog, this must rank as one of the most unique and compelling crime dramas of recent years.(Kudos, as always, to Sam Taylor for the flawless translation - that guy is a gift!)...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Dec 07, 2023","Dec 11, 2023","Dec 07, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/63331553-good-reasons-to-die

When things spiralled out of control in ‘05, he found himself fast-tracked to a new life in the US.But, when he finds a body on the beach after his morning swim, Arman’s past comes hurtling into the present. Detectives and investigative journalists take an interest in his story, and soon he finds himself on the run from some dark and cruel people.A Line in the Sand is a beautifully written, intelligent thriller that swings between huge international crimes and their very personal effect on a few poor souls. Kevin Powers – who served as a machine gunner in Iraq before turning to writing – has expanded his range once again with this highly entertaining novel of greed, power and the many moral corruptions of the western war machine. ...more",Notes are private!,1,7,1,"Sep 24, 2023","Sep 28, 2023","Sep 24, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/123197450-a-line-in-the-sand

When Eilish's husband, a trade unionist, is disappeared, it starts a chain reaction that slowly and cruelly chips away first her rights, the her freedoms, and later everything else. All the while, Eilish tries to keep her four children safe, and plot some kind of future for her fractured family.Lynch's masterpiece begins as a Kafkaesque nightmare that soon spirals to ever more desperate depths. On the one hand, this is a dystopian tale worthy of comparison with Saramago's Blindness, McCarthy's The Road and Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale.

Caretaker at the local cemetery, Blackburn has been disfigured by polio, making him something of an outsider in town, but he provides perfect care and companionship for Naomi.But, with Jacob injured in combat and on his way home, those with an axe to grind see this as the perfect opportunity to right the perceived wrongs of the past, and a shocking series of lies is about to irreparably shatter these three innocent lives.Rash has produced an utterly heart-rending tale, people with unforgettable characters.

Cosby is fast becoming the king of crime fiction and his new novel should seal his place at the top table.After a couple of truly excellent thrillers, Cosby expands his range with his latest, All The Sinners Bleed, moving into the realm of procedural crime... And it will be no surprise to anyone who's read him before to find that he is an absolute master of this as well.What starts with a school shooting soon sprawls into an almost unbearably suspenseful serial killer story that rings with all the terror of The Silence of the Lambs. This novel goes to some seriously dark places but they are all handled with the utmost skill - despite the often gruesome nature of the events depicted, it never once feels gratuitous or manipulative.In Titus, Cosby has also created a fabulous protagonist who I think still has stories to explore - I would love to see this become a series! As well as a convincing and layered character with a haunting backstory, Titus serves as a great foil to explore what life is like for Black people in law enforcement, and all the complexities that situation brings, particularly in the US.All The Sinners Bleed reads like a mash-up of Dennis Lehane and Attica Locke - fresh, real and with a classic, throwback feel to it.

Whilst there is lots to admire about it - the picture he draws of 80s London is excellent and he tackles racism in the UK in an interesting way - other elements of the story are very dated and jarring. For example, the female characters are pretty terribly depicted, and the protagonist's interactions with them worse still - he can't describe a single meeting with a woman without first telling you how their breasts sit in their shirt.

In this battered and largely lawless land, the fates of several characters - all beautifully drawn - collide in dark and dire circumstances.There are splashes of Flannery O'Connor and Donald Ray Pollock and Daniel Woodrell at every turn and, as always with southern gothic novels, the influence of Cormac McCarthy is difficult to hide from.

He also has a family mired in trauma, both from the hangover of the Troubles, and their own dark secrets.Magee's characters feel fresh and alive and his writing is crisp and sharp, particularly on class (which I found incredibly relatable and real) and the inherited ghosts of those living in the North in the wake of the Troubles.An excellent debut and someone who is only going to get better....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Mar 17, 2023","Mar 19, 2023","Mar 17, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61403426-close-to-home

As he makes his way across the fields with a backpack full of stones, his past comes back to haunt him.He is plagued by scenes of both trauma and pleasure, the voices of his parents, teachers and peers, and moments of love and lust. Porter is an expert at bringing these many facets together into a narrative that's both fresh and inventive and ever-changing, and yet lucid enough that he keeps the train of the story steady throughout. Just like in his brilliant Lanny, what cuts through is the humanity of our protagonist. Shy is troubled, yes. But he's also been chronically misunderstood by society and his own family. He's haunted by single overheard sentences he can't shake. He's been undeniably damaged by the culture around him.

For a start, nothing about it is middling, or average. So perhaps even rating it all is a futile pursuit.Cuddy is told (mainly) in four distinct parts, all written in unique styles and telling a different part of the legend and myth of St Cuthbert over more than 1,000 years in the north of England.Some parts worked for me, others really didn't. I think this is the reaction many readers will have, as every different style Myers uses is going to appeal to different people.Section 1, a kind of epic poem telling the story of the Haliwerfolc, a group of dedicated monks and others who carried Cuddy's body around the north to help it avoid desecration by the invading vikings, is glorious. It's one of the best passages I have ever read. Inventive, vivid, strange and peopled with great characters, it had me crying 'masterpiece!'.The following sections are, unfortunately, diminished returns. Section 2, a stream of consciousness novella about an affair after the building of Durham Cathedral, I enjoyed. But sections 3 and 4 became tiresome quickly, as we are asked again to switch styles and to abandon characters we had invested in. This is always near impossible to pull off and, while I admire the ambition, I feel like it could have been pared back a little.So, overall, while I didn't like some parts, I always appreciated his trademark brilliant prose and, man, that first section is worth the cover price alone.Cuddy is not my favourite of his books but, make no mistake, Benjamin Myers is one of the British writers who most pushes the boundaries of what is possible in fiction constantly and I would back him to do that every time.

A couple of annoying aspects stopped it from being a really great novel.The Wadia family controls everything in Delhi; money, politics, labor. Power.Age of Vice focuses on Sunny, the twenty-something new generation of the family. A young playboy who parties hard and dreams of transforming Delhi's river area into a modern cosmopolitan utopia, he also invests in art and other passion projects. But the money he uses is tainted with blood. The blood of the poor, the blood of bulldozed communities. Though he dreams of breaking away from his family's vicious hold on the city, he is inexorably bound to their reign of terror.There's so much to like in this novel. The setting is great, the writing is strong, there's loads of action and great characters.But the device of telling the story from so many perspectives becomes a little tiresome, as you get the same scenes told over and over. The first third of the book follows Ajay, a slum boy who becomes Sunny's assistant (loved this part). The second follows Neda, a local journalist who becomes Sunny's lover (liked this part). Then we get Sunny's perspective (this was less good). It's also way too long.

O'Connor blends deep sadness and destitution with manic dark comedy and lucid spirituality to produce an excellent novel that is never what you think it's going to be. What starts out as a story about a mostly abandoned tower block primed for demolition soon morphs into a raw character study of a man whose life is in a desperate state and who seems to have an uncanny knack for digging lower to find a new rock bottom. Our narrator is floundering in a pit of drugs, drink and despair, lurching from one doomed sexual encounter to the next, from one hallucinatory interaction to another. Never really grasping for anything better, only pushing further down the pain of the past. If this all sounds super bleak, well, it pretty much is. But the narrative is punctuated with crazy, hilarious set pieces, which lighten the story... to a point.The writing is class throughout and, though it sometimes drifts off into its own world a little bit much for me, it is still a really high quality novel and I look forward to seeing what O'Connor writes next....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,Oct 2022,"Oct 04, 2022","Oct 01, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58646393-the-voids

Then an 11-year-old growing up in the literal shadow of the Cadbury's factory, and the metaphorical shadow of WW2, we follow Mary as she grows up, finds love and work and has a relatively normal British life. A life full of dreams connections, happiness, the odd regret.We drop in on her every 10 years or so, at the big moments in the British century; The Queen's coronation, the '66 World Cup final, Diana's marriage and death. As well as Mary, we get to see her family and the country as a whole change. Or not. Concluding with the recent (current?) pandemic, Bournville paints a picture of a Britain surging with progress, leaning from optimism to pessimism, from acceptance to rejection. The characters are believable and well drawn, the premise is tantalising and skillfully constructed. But it is a bit light and sentimental for my taste, and the politics is way too on the nose.

It's unsurprisingly not as good as later masterpieces (Mystic River, Shutter Island etc) but it has all the action, social commentary and slick dialogue we have come to expect from a modern noir master.It's also interesting from a thematic point of view. Written in the early/mid 90s, it describes much the same problems of race, corruption and brutality the US is dealing with today. The novel manages to feel like it was probably quite revolutionary in its depiction of race in crime fiction at the time and yet starkly dated in its choice of language. It shows how far sensibilities have come in such a short space of time when you consider this book has a strong progressive stance and yet uses the n-word very frequently. I suspect Lehane wouldn't do this today - but, without wanting to give anything away, there is some refreshing honesty in Kenzie's relationship with his own views on race here that we could still learn from.Anyway, a good story and great introduction to two strong characters.

It was perhaps the best day I've had as a bookseller when this arrived in the post.It's seven years or more since I last read McCarthy. I had read The Road the year before and then devoured his entire catalogue in the space of 12 months. I never imagined in my wildest dreams that I'd get to read new book of his. I assumed that ship had sailed. So, alongside obvious excitement, I had some trepidation going into this; I am not the same reader I was seven years ago. I'm less patient, more reliant on plot, lazier. But I needn't have feared. Yes, this is more challenging than most of what I read these days but it was very much worth the effort.It's a difficult book to summarise as there are several complex things going on. I won't even try. All I'll say is that The Passenger is a deeply felt, sad book about a man haunted by his sister's suicide and the appalling legacy of his father, trying to make sense if his life. It is softer than McCarthy's earlier work and more humane and reflective. There is humour, too, though much of it is of the dark variety.Anyway, who cares what I think.

All the time dreaming of buying a house on top of the hill across town in Clifton, the part of Bristol reserved for wealthy whites. But Sayon sees his dream start to slip away as an act of violence sends his world spinning.McKenzie brings to vivid life the areas around Stapleton Road, St Paul's and Old Market. These are places renowned for their violence and, as a pasty young fat lad from the countryside, I'd sink lower in the seat of the bus as we travelled through them as a kid. But McKenzie shows us something else - the tight knit community that exists here, the roots people have laid down, the oppression felt in a community wilfully ignored as other parts of the city gentrify and receive investment.I loved the setting, the characters, the sensationally good dialogue. I could just feel the crafting a little bit, everything felt a bit too written. I wanted it to be braver, to be more raw. It bears comparison with Gabriel Krauze's Who They Was but McKenzie just needs to be more free and he'll definitely be in the same class....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Apr 20, 2022","Apr 25, 2022","Apr 20, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/60038664-an-olive-grove-in-ends

The best writer in the UK expands his range once again with another first class novel which will be just as surprising to fans as The Offing proved. Two men - SAS veteran Calvert and a sort of old hippy (though he'd likely be offended at the description), Redbone - roam the fields of rural England creating elaborate, revolutionary crop circles.There are aspects of The Perfect Golden Circle that flow through many of his novels - poetic prose, beautiful descriptions of the landscape, subtle social commentary. But this latest, brilliant effort sees Myers show us something new - humour. He has always felt profound and important but entertainment has never seemed like the key motivation. Here he is more playful than we've seen him. At times it felt like I was watching a lost season of The Detectorists, such was the love I felt for these two oddball characters as I chuckled along with their summer adventures.The setting here is new, too, and thrilling for myself as a resident of North Wiltshire. Away from his comfort zone, the rugged north, Myers is on fine form with the rolling wheat fields of my adopted county. The descriptions rang true, the images perfectly formed.It's so satisfying to see my favourite writer continuing to take risks and have them pay off so handsomely. He nailed it, once again.

City on Fire, the first in a new trilogy, is right up there with his best. A drunken grope at a beach party sparks off a bloody war between the Irish and Italian mobs in 1980s Providence, Rhode Island. We follow several characters, but largely Danny Ryan, a longshoreman and Irish mob debt collector whose father used to head up the business until the booze got hold of him. As the bodies start to pile up, Danny starts to rise in the organisation and has to dig deep into the darker parts of his soul to survive.Winslow manages with this novel to both show us what makes him so great - his staccato style, his dialogue, his action - but also widens his repertoire with this move into writing about gang warfare. It's a seamless transition from his seminal Cartel trilogy and his earlier PI and beach noir novels.Bloody, brutal, brilliant. This is the crime novel of the year.

End of.The book itself is a strange mix of utterly fresh and ultimately pointless. For the first 150 pages I was so excited by the style, so intrigued by Sean's character and felt he was building up to saying something really profound about modern masculinity. I love books that feel raw and gritty and examine fringe or working class living. Take Gabriel Krauze's fucking masterpiece, Who They Was, as an example. That's where I thought Fuccboi was heading.But Conroe, for all this promise, doesn't ever get to the point. He has nothing much to say. Who They Was never once comes across as self indulgent. Fuccboi only ever does. There's a whole genre built around (largely male, largely American) writers detailing their lives through thinly veiled protagonists and the project building to something so much bigger than themselves - Bret Easton Ellis, Bukowski, Fante et al. Conroe's debut doesn't achieve that.But make no mistake - the kid has got skills. He just needs to harness them better. I feel like he needs someone to help him hone his style and refine his storytelling so he can maintain that early brilliance across a whole book.

That she wrote this at 17 years old is simply astonishing. It's unbelievable. She had the assuredness of a writer a decade older or more.Kiara's mother is incarcerated, her father is dead, her brother contributes nothing to their living situation as he chases his dreams of becoming a successful rapper like his uncle Ty. Kiara is struggling to keep up with the brutal rent increases on their Oakland apartment. She also has Trevor, a neighbour's kid, to look out for. And there's worse in her past, too.Kiara stumbles into prostitution one night after a chance encounter with her brother's ex while out looking for a job. Thus sparks a chain of events that will thrust this young woman into the public eye as she attempts to claw herself out of this typically American poverty.Mottley demonstrates huge skill throughout the narrative in constructing not only a compelling and gripping story but also a subtle exposition of America's broken society.

Born into a world rich in cash, culture and patriotism, the eldest sibling Charles is on holiday from his studies at Cambridge. A passionate botanist, he is now bored and listless and the summer opens out ahead of him. He fills this time by chasing after his sister’s piano teacher, Hettie. Their affair leads to a pregnancy that will change their lives forever.While Charles spends the next decades forging himself the career in business and politics he has been born for, his sisters have other callings to follow. Tabitha is pulled to activism, not only campaigning for the women's vote but also helping the hungry and needy. Eloise, meanwhile, is drawn to art, developing herself as a painter under the tutelage of European and American talents, eventually joining a salon in Paris reminiscent of Gertrude Stein’s.This is a novel about power and wealth and how privilege insulates itself. How connections are maintained and how difficult it is to claw your way in - or indeed out - of this peculiarly British elite. O’Riordan’s prose is as beautiful and decadent as you would expect – he is a renowned poet – and the story is strangely beguiling in this magnificent debut for fans of Ian McEwan, William Boyd and Benjamin Myers’ The Offing....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Oct 26, 2021","Oct 29, 2021","Oct 26, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59457730-the-falling-thread

In other words, she feels real. Her narrative is utterly candid. Strout gives us a true window into the soul, where not everything you will find is gold.

Sure, there are a few flaws - the main one being how easily and quickly the characters accept drastic changes of circumstances and death.

It follows a similar path in that it is a book of wild, exciting ideas that spark hilarity and horror in equal measure. This time we have a central character, Delaney, attempting to bring the company (renamed The Every after buying out Amazon) down from the inside after securing a job there.I would go as far as to argue that the ideas this time are even better, even more hideously likely to happen. And they come like a torrent. For the first 350 pages or so there's little by way of plot, more a slew of new apps and plans for humanity as Delaney attempts to push The Every off a cliff by coming up with every more insane and intrusive ideas - all of which are embraced by the conformist sheeples of the world's population. This is all so enjoyable to read and pick apart. The satire is rich and funny and, as with the best dystopian fiction, says more about where we are now than where we are going.Then some kind of plot kicks in. If I'm being honest, this part wasn't that great. It was kind of predictable and not that novel. But I think I felt similarly about The Circle, too.

From page one we find Kara caught between cultures; the opening story sees her cast as an outsider on a trip back to Jamaica from Canada, fearful of a pig's head in the freezer and taunted for not being able to climb and hang from trees like her cousins. We then follow Kara's journey through her teens in Toronto, through friendships with others from Islands families, her relationships with her fractious family and her first experiences with boys.There is so much in this novel that will be relatable to everyone who can still remember their teenage years. But what really makes it stand out are the details particular to Kara's (and I assume the author's) experience; the twin pressures of fitting in to Canadian society while retaining her Jamaican heritage.

Iron Annie announces yet another stunningly original voice toLike Irvine Welsh, Kevin Barry and Lisa McInerney got together to write a queer Mr Nice. Iron Annie announces yet another stunningly original voice to the stage of Irish literature. Luke Cassidy has produced a debut novel that swings between brutal violence and tender introspection (sometimes on the same page, even the same sentence!).Aoife is a drug dealer in Dundalk, one of several in town. Rather than become rivals, the various dealers have organised a union, of sorts, meeting regularly to discuss issues in town and helping each other out with jobs. The most colourful of these is The Rat King, a traveller drug boss with a wild rat he's tamed that lives in his pocket.And among all of this is Annie. Iron Annie. A fairy, enigmatic, sexually liberated young redhead who Aoife accidentally starts a lesbian relationship with - she doesn't realise Annie isn't a man until she's got her trousers off. When The Rat King scores 10kg of stolen coke he needs to offload, Aoife agrees to take it to England and disperse it there, using Annie's contacts. Much of the novel revolves around the two women on this wild road trip, each contact and each town proving more crazy than the last.What elevates this novel, however, is the prose.

The only thing left to decide is where to put the station. Three options are on the table - The Larkspur, a brutalist housing estate hated by much of the town but culturally and architecturally significant; The Generator, a multi-million pound, largely unused arts centre; or The Chapel, beloved home of Peterdown United FC and the heart of the community.We follow Colin, sports reporter for the local paper and a son of the town, and his partner Ellie, a London-born architect dragged to Peterdown by its lure of cheap housing after the birth of their child. Colin can't bare the prospect of the club he loves being shunted out of town - but the millionaire owner would happily see a new stadium and all the opportunities that might bring. Ellie, meanwhile, sees the Larkspur as her salvation, a rescue mission not just for the forgotten female architect who designed it, but for her own career, stalled as it has been by motherhood and Peterdown.But there are dark forces at play behind the scenes in this brilliantly imagined post-industrial town. A cast of characters will come to the fore, all with their own agendas and their own plans for Peterdown... and very few of them have the town and its history at the the front of their thoughts.This spectacular epic of modern Britain may be based in a fictional town but the characters and the landscape will be familiar to many. Annand uses Peterdown and its inhabitants to explore our shifting attitudes to class, community, belonging and each other. This is the beating heart of one British town laid bare in all of its dysfunctional beauty. It is a contemporary kitchen-sink drama for the ages - there are so many lines and characters and threads that Alan Sillitoe would have been proud of.Annand has produced a novel of rare, moving power that I will not forget in a long, long time. As well as being about class and identity and money and power, it is also, unashamedly, that mythical, near-impossible thing - Peterdown is the great football novel....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Jun 26, 2021","Jul 05, 2021","Jun 30, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57836002-peterdown

I went back to my new uni girlfriend's family home in Tonypandy for the weekend, to meet her parents for the first time. After a couple of days eating heavy meals and slowly trying to charm them with my westcountry cheek, we set off back to university in Swansea. Five minutes after departing that typical valleys town, we edged over a ridge and drove a mountain road flanked by death-defying drops. Roaring waterfalls plundered down ancient rockfaces, sheep grazed lazily at the grassy roadside, the gulleys and gulches fell dramatically all around. I hadn't witnessed natural beauty like it. I kept asking her parents to stop and let me take photos on my disposable camera to show my dad. It was like I'd discovered some secret the Welsh were keeping from the English.Over the next decade and more, I would go back to the Rhondda hundreds of times (we are now married with two children, though much of her family has now moved away from the area). Every occasion was bookended by the same glorious drive. The people were warm and friendly to a level I haven't encountered anywhere else. But, the longer I spent there, the more you could see this place was no Eden. The deprivation became more evident with each passing year. This was a place abandoned by industry, by employers, by politics.Rachel Trezise's new novel, Easy Meat, brings this clash of beauty and abandonment to the fore. It follows a day in the life of Caleb Jenkins, an ex-reality TV star now working the boning line at a slaughterhouse to keep his family afloat. His family carpet business has gone bust and his parents and brother have had to move in with him.This is no ordinary day either. 23 June, 2016. Brexit vote day.Caleb negotiates his day with the resigned stoicism of the contemporary working class, while politics swirls all around him. His apathy on Brexit is evident, though he's surrounded by self-declared experts on the subject, as well as scores of European workers at the slaughterhouse. How can he not be apathetic? When would he have the time or inclination to educate himself about it? He's trapped by The Machine. As the day comes to a conclusion, the country is on the verge of a momentous decision and Caleb has hardly given it much thought.Trezise has delivered a sublime portrait of Welsh working class life. She presents the clashing polarisation of the national moment with care and devoid of judgement, preferring to listen and understand rather than opine. Her ear for the rhythms and cadence of Valleys speak is excellent and she blends comic elements perfectly with the underlying bleakness of Caleb's situation. Running through it all, however, are the striving working class people, Welsh and European alike, just trying to make things better for themselves and their families; people used as tokenistic political pawns far too often in recent years.This is the Brexit novel we've been waiting for....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"May 13, 2021","May 15, 2021","May 13, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/55977749-easy-meat

Many well-meaning, largely urban and Our response to ecological collapse may prove to be the defining legacy of our generation, one way or the other. Many well-meaning, largely urban and middle class people have taken to the streets in the name of the planet in recent years. But waving placards and climbing on top of trains when something becomes fashionable is all show. In this brilliant, deeply moving book, James Rebanks details what true rebellion and real bravery look like.Rebanks begins by recounting his romantic upbringing, largely under the wing of his grandfather who, even in the 70s and 80s was something of a throwback to a simpler time. He writes beautifully of time spent on his grandfather's rented Cumbria farm where he learned to do things the old way: slow, labor-intensive farming that was in step with the natural world around them - though they never necessarily thought of it like that. It was just the way things had always been done - rotating crops, leaving fields to rest during fallow years, grazing livestock who then shit the goodness back into the soil.He then shatters this English idyll, recounting his and his father's push to modernise their farm and 'improve' their land in ways encouraged by greedy governments and supermarkets. Fertilizers were spread, fields enlarged, hedgerows and coppices cleared. The soil health decimated.Rebanks shows honesty and candour when detailing the things his family got wrong and this serves as a basis for change towards the end of his father's life. Rebanks picks up the pieces and gives us his blueprint for the future of farming in the UK - a future where farms and the natural world coexist for the benefit of nature and humans alike, where there is diversity and rotation, harking back to the traditions of the past while embracing new technologies. These are changes he has already made on his own farm - to the consternation of some and to the detriment of his finances in a world where all incentives pour towards intensive, single-crop or single-livestock farming. These are brave choices he has made which have both eyes on the long term. This is farming for the benifit of generations he will never see. And it is something that is radical and requires conversations and cooperation to work. This is real bravery. Real activism. Rebanks is someone with his hands in the soil, not some placard-waving virtue-signaller. His father and grandfather would be very proud....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Mar 19, 2021","Mar 25, 2021","Mar 19, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/49309243-english-pastoral

Ethan Hawke really has got some fuckin balls, writing a novel in 2021 about the plight of the wealthy white man.But, God, it's good.Ethan Hawke is an author. Yes, yes, yes, I know he's actually an actor. A very fine actor. A twice Oscar-nominated actor (he has two Oscar nominations for writing, too). But he is also, without doubt, an author. That's about as good a compliment as you can pay to anyone switching crafts like this. He's an artist, if you will. This is no vanity project; it's a proper, high-quality novel. Hawke is exactly the right person to give us an insight into the craft of acting and the realities of fame - his narrator is a movie star who, just as his marriage is falling apart, is poised to make his Broadway debut. The only actor in the production not traditionally trained, he is desperate not to appear as a ticket pull for tourists. At the same time, he's drinking too much, fearful of losing his kids and stumbling from one damaging sexual encounter to the next.What we get is a subtle and realistic character arc as William starts to grow up, both professionally and personally. He starts to take some responsibility for himself but, more than that, sees himself for who he is once the narcissism is stripped away.A very impressive novel. I hope this isn't just a one off.

Russell's story tells of Vanessa, a 15yo girl who begins a relationship - if that's an appropriate thing to call it - with her teacher, Jacob Strane, at a private Maine boarding school. What begins as flirting moves swiftly to kissing and then a protracted sexual relationship. We jump back and forward between the abuse in the early 2000s to 2017 when another former student comes forward during the early surge of the #Metoo movement with accusations against Strane.Vanessa herself is a fascinating character, so complex and so convincing in her portrayal of the relationship as love rather than abuse - she refuses to believe this girl and defends him to anyone who dares call him a monster.Russell's novel is highly addictive and very well structured. It is often uncomfortable, even distressing to read, especially during the sex scenes.

How do we protect the environment and also create jobs? How do we access the resources needed in our daily lives without causing destruction of our natural environments? How do we deal with the injustices of the past while also looking to the future? Is capitalism viable any more and, if not, what then? How the hell do we live now? What the fuck have we done??

I also took issue with the lack of subtlety employed at times - this is all tell and no show.

Jodie Sheehan seems to have been the perfect daughter, the perfect student, the perfect athlete. But as Haven starts to dig into her life, he finds a darker side that may have led to her death.At the same time, Haven has been called by a social worker friend to assess another girl, one who has been through the most horrific experiences imaginable.

But is Evie as bad as they all say?You do need to suspend belief a few times with this one but that sort of comes as part of the deal with this kind of book.

He backs up his hugely promising collection of stories, Lot, with this excellent debut novel, which I chomped through in a couple of days.Ultimately, this is an examination of a relationship between two young men who, after four years of being together, aren't entirely sure they're moving forward at all.We meet Mike and Benson as Mike is about to head back to Japan - where he was born - to be with his dying father (a man he hasn't seen in years and has a pretty poor relationship with). At the same time, Mike's mother Mitsuko is heading to the US to (she thinks) stay with her son. But it's left to Benson to do the entertaining in Mike's absence, something he's not entirely on board with, having never met Mitsuko before.This kind of sounds like the set up for a comedy. But, while there are some funny moments, particularly as Mitsuko and Benson learn to live with each other, it's actually a deeply tender and realistic look at love in the 21st century. This book is so damn readable, so damn insightful, so damn charming and so damn enjoyable that it's very easy to ignore its few small flaws and just eat up the pages.

And grateful I was one before the Internet became such an integral part of everyday life.As ever, the difficulties with split narratives are evident here. The parts of the book where we're following Angel are convincing, for the most part. Oseman presents a realistic and insightful look into fandom and the voice feels very authentic. However, I didn't buy Jimmy's character at all. Fame is such a difficult thing to write about and I don't think she succeeds here. He is full of clichés and hard to sympathise with.I did have issues with the way the only straight white male character is portrayed - essentially as an idiot who just doesn't get it. This seemed a bit unnecessary. But on the other hand, there is so much great representation in this book - it must be great for teenagers who can feel like outsiders to be able to see themselves in fiction.

Escaping the unnamed city, which is always burning, Duncan Peck arrives at a small settlement on Dartmoor. His cousin, James Hale, is the law in this strange community, a archetypal English village in many ways, with its butcher shop, tearoom and cottages. But looming over the place is a huge wall upon which are scrawled announcements, messages and, critically, the local gossip. It is this gossip which forms the basis of justice in the community - it is Hale's job to take note of it and dish out punishments as he sees fit. This could be a burden to carry - a table or chair tied to your back, a week in the stocks being pelted with shit and rotten fruit - or it could be an iron bar to the shin.Peck isn't used to any of this, either the civilised nature of daily life, nor the medieval forms of justice his cousin dishes out. And he is ready to stir things up.It's a tantalising premise which is mostly well handled. But there's a lot going on and I feel it could have been stripped back a little. There's so much to get through that McMullan spends more time than he needs telling rather than showing. It also suffers a little from the publisher's comparison of the novel with McCarthy's The Road on the cover - a poisoned chalice, if ever there was one. A more accurate comparison might be Jim Crace, who writes about both medieval and dystopian communities with such skill.A decent read but not a real stand out....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Sep 20, 2020","Sep 22, 2020","Sep 20, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/54388713-the-last-good-man

To unravel the mystery of his death, Emezi takes us back through his life to its very beginnings and weaves a tale of blurring identity and sexual awakening.

I finished this with tears in my eyes and a twist in my stomach.A book of two distinct halves, the first of which follows a group of young friends in 1986 Glasgow as they plan for a trip to Manchester G-Mex for a music festival - The Smiths, New Order et al. These lads, all in their late teens and early 20s, are bonded by music, books, films and politics. They are from deeply working-class backgrounds and share a hatred of Thatcher, racism and capitalism. Their lives seem at once defined, enhanced and restricted by their class - James, our narrator, believes the idea of university ludicrous, while his best friend Tully, despite dreams of a music career, sees a life at the lathe looming. At one point James is laughed out of an interview at a fencing firm when the boss spots a battered copy of Sartre in his pocket.This first part of the novel I found incredibly convincing and personally very resonant. It demonstrates the difficulties of being working class and bookish; of being working class and wanting more, yet not willing to accept the price of becoming middle-class; the difficulties of defending workers' rights while sometimes being repulsed by the views and actions of those very people you're standing up for.The second half opens thirty years later, with James taking a call from Tully, who has news to share. I don't want to give too much away about the plot but I'll say the second half is deeply affecting and wholly convincing.I fell completely in love with these characters and their stories. Their friendship is intoxicating and felt incredibly real. The changes - for better or worse - these bonds go through over time also hit home hard - O'Hagan just gets male friendship.In short, it is a beautiful novel, steeped in nostalgia but not shying away from the difficulties of lifelong friendship.

And her inventive, brave prose style does have similarities with the likes of Barry (Kevin). But, reading this quite brilliant novel, I was most reminded of the great writers of the American South. Religion, warring brothers, a bitter matriarch, a fallen hero patriarch, crime and punishment - all set in a rural, farming community beset by economic problems, history of famine and an uncertain future. What about that doesn't scream Faulkner, McCarthy, Steinbeck or McCullers? Hughes blends a distinctive, challenging storytelling voice with a gripping and dark family story.

But it's far from perfect.The novel opens with a glorious 60-page prologue, telling the story of Norman, a Jamaican family man trying to make a life in the Midlands. The writing in this opening section is so, so strong. It's first person, in Norman's accent, and feels authentic, engaging and heartfelt. Norman arrives in England to find life isn't what he expected. Upon arrival in the black country, he quips, ""We leave the garden of Eden for the Land of Milk and Honey and find Sodom and Gomorrah.""But that's pretty much it for Norman's story. Such a shame as Mendez had created a brilliant, believable storytelling voice at this point.We then move on to Jesse, a young black boy coming of age in the Midlands, struggling with his sexual and religious identity. Thrown out of his family's branch of Jehovah's Witnesses after his homosexuality comes to light, he eventually leaves home for London, where he hopes to find his true life.Jesse's story is certainly affecting - particularly in his sexual awakening, which bares all the scars of his upbringing. And his encounters with racism feel wholly relevant and yet depressingly familiar.But there is a lot of writing. Way too much. I was getting itchy for some sort of resolution by page 250 and the end still felt so far away. At 100 pages shorter, with all the guff chopped out, this would be magnificent. As it is, it's only alright.

And Their Children After Them, which won the Prix Goncourt a couple of years agoThere's the ring of a Ken Loach film about this stylish French novel. And Their Children After Them, which won the Prix Goncourt a couple of years ago and has just been translated into English, is a sunbathed picture of the rural poor in 1990s France, a coming-of-age story etched in sepia, overflowing with nostalgia.Following, among others, a boy called Anthony from the time he's 14 in the early decade, to his 20th year as France enjoys the hysteria of home World Cup glory in '98, it shows the joys of young love and lust against a backdrop of failure, a lack of hope and a lost generation with no direction.Many of the teenagers we spend time with suffer from tough upbringings and institutional racism. But Mathieu's stylish prose stops short of making this a gritty affair - This Is England for a French audience this certainly ain't.The structure is clever - we meet the characters every two years as they negotiate their formative summers. It's a story full of subtlety and nuance, addressing lots of issues without really discussing them. The writing and translation are very beautiful. Yet the whole thing lacks a little bit of oomph. There is little really by way of plot and it probably suffers for it. After the long first section, which was fairly nicely contained, the story meanders to an underwhelming finish.

Quality writing and a very interesting premise, let down only by the difficulty in relating to - and sympathising with - the cast of characters.Shooting Down Heaven is narrated by Larry, the son of a fallen capo, a confidant of Escobar who disappeared after the drug lord's killing.We meet Larry as he returns to Colombia after 12 years away in England. His father's remains have finally been found and he has come back to lay him to rest. The Colombia he finds, though, is not the one he left. Neither is the family. His mother, a former beauty queen who lived in luxury on his father's drug money, has now been reduced to gambling, a nasty coke habit and a small apartment she is deeply embarrassed by. His brother is hiding on his farm - the only one the authorities let them keep when they broke up the drug empire. His grandfather has gone mad and his grandmother is more bitter than ever.Told partly in flashbacks to the weeks after Escobar's downfall, and partly in the present day as Larry negotiates the complicated grief he feels for his dead father, it features a difficult collection of characters to really root for. Franco explores the lives of those children brought up in illegal wealth. Their guilt, their regret but also their entitlement. And it's this last point that makes these people so hard to stomach. Yes, they've suffered. And often it wasn't directly their fault - they were born into this life or were trapped in it by powerful, brutal men. And yet, they have lived that luxurious life and still retain a bitterness that it was taken away.It makes for a fascinating moral quandary and Franco handles the subject matter well - even if Larry -	and the reader - never quite get their hands on all the answers....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"May 04, 2020","May 06, 2020","May 04, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/52881269-shooting-down-heaven

And I'm not sure it's quite worth the effort.The book follows two main storylines, 1) a young man in Mexico City in the late 60s, looking for revenge after his brother's murder, and 2) a reclusive wolf trapper in the Yukon on the trail of a huge, vicious wolf.Both characters have their merits, though the scenes in Mexico City are far more convincing and well fleshed out. It's gritty and the prose is nicely translated. The action scenes are well drawn and the dialogue is excellent. There are numerous interesting side characters, all of whom add something to the story - not least the animals both men encounter. But the book has flaws. There is a huge amount of foreshadowing, to the point that big chunks of the story feels repetitive and thus lack tension at key moments. And the payoff of following these two vastly different storylines doesn't quite arrive - when everything comes together there is a sense of anti-climax. It feels like two separate stories.A decent read but too much hard work and not enough reward for me to really highly recommend....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Apr 15, 2020","Apr 20, 2020","Apr 15, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43435414-the-untameable

Colum McCann has created somethinThis is a tremendous work of art, an original feat of storytelling, a tome to admire, a humbling reading experience. Colum McCann has created something new by recreating lots of old things.This is a novel in name only (in fact, the addition of A Novel to the title is in itself tongue in cheek.) It is novel, history, politics, reportage, short story, nature writing, memoir, biography and more. It is glorious. And yet it is flawed. It's too long by 1/3 at least. The story, in some ways, is simple. It is the history of two men - both real living people - one a Palestinian, the other an Israeli, who have lost daughters to the ongoing conflict. Both have fought for their countries. Both are now leading members of a group seeking to bring peace to the region by talking, not with M16s.That is basically it. But that also only scratches the surface. McCann reinvents this narrative over and over again, unlocking new doors that lead to new stories, histories, anecdotes, snippets of history. Always building, always layering these men's back-stories and those of the region, the conflict, the occupation, the darn migrating birds. The effect is quite stunning. You wonder where it's going for a few pages and then suddenly, Wow! it all slides into place. Then before you know it, you've moved on, seamlessly, to new topics, new characters, new stories. And yet always the same. But really there's a bit too much of it. I think he could have slimmed it down by a couple hundred pages and it would be more accessible and even more enjoyable. It's hard to sustain a book of 450 pages that has little in the way of suspense or urgency. But hey, I'm nitpicking.

Dusapin is a brilliant new voice and her debut novel is textured, multi-layered and hypnotic.The story is a seemingly simple one, about a girl working the winter season at a guest house in Sokcho, a holiday destination on the south side of the Korean DMZ. She meets a French comic book artist and shows him the town in all its off-season dourness. From this set-up, Dusapin explores issues of gender, expectation, culture, identity and alienation.

Mickey's sister is an addict and a sex worker and she's gone awol, right as a number of fellow street girls have wound up dead. This will have quite a wide appeal, I would think. As well as being a gripping story that moves quickly, it also feel very timely and important. In many ways it reminded me of Richard Price's Clockers - it lacks the heft of Price's intense realism but is all the more accessible for it. It's also so rare to see a mother (or any parent, for that matter) in literature who, as well as caring about and being committed to her job, has to handle all the arse-ache that comes with balancing work and family.

There will be a lot of hype around it when it is published and all I can say is: Believe every single word of it.Don Winslow has called it a ""Grapes of Wrath for our times"" and I have to say I completely agree. Cummins has done for the Latin American migrant what Steinbeck did for the Okies. She has humanised their experience.The book opens with Lydia and her young son Luca cowering in their bathroom while Cartel thugs slaughter 16 members of their family in the garden outside. From there we follow mother and son as they travel north from Acapulco, desperate to reach the US border and escape.They meet many other migrants along the way, all running from tragedies of their own, as they hike through dusty desert, hole up at migrant centres and jump high speed freight trains.Theirs is a harrowing, tragic and deeply moving tale. But there is hope, too, and the odd flickers of kindness, compassion and comradeship that act as beacons on their journey. The love between mother and son is beautifully, fiercely rendered.There is a lot of fiction out there set around the US-Mexico border, much of it focussing on Cartel goons and CIA agents. But never before has the light been shone so acutely on the plight of the victims.

Laskar writes about something that doesn't get much air time - the experience of Indian Americans in modern society. Her fragmented storytelling seems to have irked a few on here but I didn't really have an issue with that, in fact that was my favourite part of it. My issues lie with the characters. Firstly, the protagonist and her family, whose interesting story is not at all fleshed out. I am not really sure why she doesn't name any of them and this feels like a needless gimmick. I also have a little bit of a problem with pretty much every white person in the novel being a racist and every non-white person being open and friendly and accepting. While I get the point, I'm not sure this is a particularly helpful or accurate portrayal of Americans.

Issues of race are also handled in an original way (I won't say too much about this for fear of spoilers).Whiskey When We're Dry is, at heart, a tender, moving story about one young woman's search for identity and meaning in a man's world.

And it works beautifully on most levels.A wolf crosses the border between Poland and Germany. As it travels on towards Berlin, the wolf is spotted by a disparate group of characters, whose lives gradually become more closely entwined. Some are obsessed with the wolf, tracking its movements, dreaming of killing it. Others have bigger problems.The whole story is told delicately and Schimmelpfennig's skills as a playwright are in evidence in the sharp, realistic dialogue throughout.

There's just not enough depth to the story or the characters and it all leaves a sour taste.This is the second book on the subject I've read recently and, though very different, Tom Perrotta's Mrs Fletcher handles sexual addiction much better with far more relatable characters....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,Apr 2019,"Apr 02, 2019","Apr 01, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/40265073-ad-le

This is a sweet, funny novel that tackles some serious and very contemporary issues, namely 21st century sexual politics.Eve Fletcher has sent her son off to college and it's left a huge void in her life; she fills it with an addiction to internet pornography. Suddenly is seems like every person and situation has the potential to become sexualised. Eve stumbles along, trying to convince herself she is exploring her sexuality and finally making a mark on the world, freed from the shackles of domesticity. But things start to unravel and she finds her decisions affecting her work and her mental state.Meanwhile, her son Brendan is busy negotiating the pitfalls of sexual consent, or not, and facing the fallout from the #MeToo movement.This could so easily have become a farce, or turned overly sexual, but Perrotta pitches it perfectly. It's funny, awkward and peopled in the main with realistic characters. There is even a fairly fully-developed trans character.Perrotta's novel is ambitious in that it tackles such a wide range of very modern issues but he pulls it off pretty well.

And it is very well done.The teenage daughter of a rich businessman is kidnapped and ex-detective Carlos Trevino is hired to find her. He scours the backstreets of the fictional coastal resort of La Eternidad, a town caught in the middle of a bloody territorial war between two drug cartels.Alongside Trevino's search is the story of Police Chief Margarito, a man whose decades of corrupt, murderous rule are about to come to an end, by either retirement or the payback of those he has wronged - whichever comes first.As in James Ellroy's best work, Solares has created a world filled to the brim with awful people in a town where everyone is on the take and bodies are dropped at an alarming rate. He doesn't quite have the panache of Ellroy, nor the cinematic quality of Don Winslow, but his storytelling is hardboiled and moves at a thrilling pace.

If he kills himself with a shot from a .44 Magnum? Great, bring it on, it only adds to the legacy.Ianthe Brautigan's memoir of her father Richard tears away the romance of his death, of his periods of alcohol abuse, and tells not just of the wonderful man he was but also the effect his devastating final act had on her life.Brautigan, according to his daughter, was everything you'd hope he would be from reading his glorious books: eccentric, loving, poetic, romantic and turbulent.But he had a dark side, too. Weeks of benders resulted in him smashing furniture and shooting holes in the walls of his ranch while his teenage daughter failed to sleep upstairs. He first spoke to Ianthe about killing himself when she was just nine. His sudden and incredible fame was unwelcome, but his fall from favour and bad s towards the end of his life cut deep, culminating in his suicide in 1984.This is a deeply poetic book, full of raw emotion and drenched in love and regret for her genius father. It sometimes reads like what it is - a book written less to be read than as an act of catharsis. But that only adds to the authenticity of this sad and very real meditation on grief, death and family....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Feb 05, 2019","Feb 19, 2019","Feb 05, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/12572.You_Can_t_Catch_Death

Vuillard approaches each with an unasked question - could you really not see what was coming? He also questions our view of proceedings. History, at least when it is taught in schools, likes to put things in simple boxes. If the Nazis are evil, as we all agree, then those who opposed them must be good, must have been 'saving' us? Vuillard challenges that notion. He attempts to expose the charade of the Anschluss, of appeasement, of millionaires' support for the Nazis, for what they were - political posturing.Much of what is written here will be familiar to seasoned historians but for the layman like myself it is all fascinating and quite chilling.This is a gripping and highly readable book which should be foisted upon politicians the world over to remind them that time will one day make them accountable for their actions....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Feb 04, 2019","Feb 04, 2019","Feb 04, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/41966091-the-order-of-the-day

I mean, it's overwritten and a bit clunky at times. But it comes together in the end.Set in Stockholm in the late 18th century, it depicts a city full of sickness, severed limbs and the scents of rotting shit. A truly disgusting place.Amid all this, a limbless, eyeless, toothless torso is fished out if the festering water. It is then left to an odd couple team of investigators to find the identity of the body and how it met its grisly end.The story unfolds against the backdrop of great political and royal upheaval, with the Swedish King Gustav recently assassinated and Mary Antoinette about to lose her head.It reads almost like a very bleak and disgusting Sherlock Holmes at times (one scene in particular is one if the most harrowing things I have read). And certain parts reminded me of Varenne's Retribution Road, though it's not as gritty or as well written.

Five 30-something friends return from a week in a mountainside cabin to find the world they left behind ruined. Whole towns are burnt to the ground, bodies lie strewn everywhere, cars are piled up on the roads. All very familiar from many such books. But Helle does do something different with Euphoria. For a start, his characters aren't likeable, rational, determined romantics like you find in much dystopian literature. They are pretty much a bunch of pricks. I mean, they are fairly normal in most ways but they are greedy and arrogant and commit a couple of appalling acts and show no remorse whatsoever. Helle also adds some interesting satirical strands - Euro notes being useful only to start fires; glimpses of planes flying overhead, suggesting it is Austria alone that has been cut off; the German border protected by landmines. All scream of Brexit dystopia!Not a great book, by any standards. The characterisation is lacking and it never really goes anywhere.

All sounds nice enough.However, these are Nazi soldiers, they have a Jewish captive in tow and the cottage is in Poland.Mingarelli's approach is so human, his touch so light, that you read page after page, enjoying the story, sympathising with the tough life of the soldiers, completely forgetting you are reading about one of the most horrific events in modern history.The humanization of Nazis is hugely controversial and the kind of thing authors don't often get away with in the UK. But it is necessary and, as much as we may hate it, true. The soldiers express horror at what is happening in the camps, they have sympathy with the captured Jew. They worry about family members back at home. They crave a hot meal. They are human. But are they evil? Is it possible to participate in evil acts and simultaneously regret them? Is it possible that good people can be swept up in shocking, brutal crimes? How much did average Nazi soldiers believe in what was ordered from above?This is a book full of uncomfortable truths and uncomfortable questions, especially for British readers, who have long been exposed to the simple rhetoric of good vs evil, right vs wrong, when it comes to World War 2.Mingarelli has done such a powerful job with this short, spare but important novel.

James McBride's memoir, subtitled A Black Man's Tribute to His White Mother, is a deeply emotional and very beautiful tribute to an astonishing woman.Ruth McBride Jordan was a Polish immigrant, raised in the divided south by a cowering, polio-stricken mother and abusive rabbi father. But somehow she had bravery where most others held only hate and fear - she stepped across the racial divide. Ruth left her family behind and married a black man in New York, with whom she had eight children. When he died, she married another and made her kids an even 12.Together they scratched out a full, hectic and rich life in the Red Hook projects and later Queens, battling poverty, prejudice and sometimes each other. Incredibly, every one of her 12 children graduated from college and went on to great things, largely by the force of her love and her will.This memoir - told in alternate chapters by Ruth and James - is as moving a book as I have ever read and is the kind of story that makes you proud to be human and to be alive....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Oct 30, 2018","Nov 02, 2018","Oct 30, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/29209.The_Color_of_Water

This was my first Winton and I thoroughly enjoyed it. He is a very fine Australian storyteller.Jaxie's fifteen, his mother has died and he works with his abusive dad (whom he calls Captain Wankbag) in his butcher shop. One night he comes home to find Wankbag dead, so he panics and runs to the vast saltflats. The book then becomes survivalist fiction in a landscape whose terrain and brutality are so harsh and alien to most people that it feels post-apocolyptic.While the plot isn't entirely original, the setting certainly is and Winton has a feral, potty-mouthed and very convincing narrater in Jaxie.There are parrallels with McCarthy's The Road and Carrasco's Out in the Open but Winton does enough to make The Shepherd's Hut stand out on its own.

He dodders around Paris, calling up old friends asking to sleep on their sofa, often shagging them when he gets his foot in the door.The teaser on the back cover says Vernon is in possession of some recordings of his friend, the recently deceased rock legend Alex Bleach, and that he is being hounded for the tapes by fans and the media. But that's a red herring as it is hardly mentioned and isn't at all integral to the story.Much of the book comes from the points of view of the many people Vernon encounters on his journeys.

So the cops turn to Filiberto Garcia, a gun-for-hire with contacts in the Chinatown opium dens and poker houses. What follows is a long string of stiffs, lots of bad language and several layers of political corruption.The homophobia, mysoginy and racism is a bit grating at times but this is, I guess, the tough underbelly of 60s Mexico City.

After serving in Germany during the clean-up at the end of WW2, he attempted to kill Goering at the Nurenburg trials, being disarmed by a fellow soldier moments before.He returned to the US and went to UCLA on the GI bill. He then became part of a communist cell and fell into a job as a talent agent at Sam Jaffe's agency, where they handled everyone from jobbing scriptwriters like John Fante and James Agee to huge stars like Humphrey Bogart.Black Sunset is the brilliant story of this period of his life as he works the sleazy world of the movies while being hounded by FBI agents during the height of McCarthyism. Anyone interested in the movies or McCarthyism will love this book. The writing is glorious, like James Ellroy living in Chandler's LA.

Cy Bellman, a widower with a small farm and a young daughter, heads west looking for dinosaur bones and general adventure.This is a decent read and very quick - I just read it in one bite this morning. But it feels quite unfulfilled. There's nothing wrong with it - decent writing, engrossing enough - but I felt like there's something missing. It's more of a fleshed-out short story than a short novel. I would also have been quite annoyed if I had paid £12 for it. I like short books but she is taking the biscuit a bit with this one.
