Misshapen, little chance of  attention, no particular audience, etc., etc., etc. I seriously dug it.Yes, okay, it's mostly book (and a few film) s, rather vaguely broken out by category (""Writers"" ""The Visual World,"" ""Science,"" etc.), along with some even more general stuff filed under ""In General."" Sounds bad. It's not: it's a great and idiosyncratic cruise through (mostly) the last three decades of the twentieth century, with a couple of personal detours into World War II-era Shanghai, when Ballard, his parents, and his little sister were confined together by the Japanese in one small room for nearly three years. The writing is pure Ballard, which would be more than enough for me even if he were writing about his collection of rusted sardine cans. The hook here isn't really the material, but rather its range and the way it's processed and commented upon. Ballard doesn't spend much time dallying with the Masters of 20th Century Fiction. Yes, there's Thomas Wolfe and Fitzgerald, Vonnegut and Burroughs (largely second-hand, via their biographies), but most of the books he writes about are odds and ends of nonfiction that provide springboards to something he wants to talk about. Who'll you find here? Nancy Reagan (as crudely dismembered and presented for inspection by ""chainsaw biographer"" Kitty Kelley); Richard Feynman; Walt Disney; Freud; Docs Papa and Baby; Hitler and MEIN KAMPF paired with Joyce and ULYSSES; Coca-Cola; a guy who wrote earnest and romantic marriage manuals in the 50s; STAR WARS (dismissed as ""Hobbits in Space""); the depraved last empress of China, Tzu Hsi; Salvador Dali...you get the picture. Except it's more like a jigsaw puzzle.Can one tell anything about someone from a list of his or her favorite books?

David Burke actually *is* a good writer, and he has a sharp eye for the interesting anecdote, sidelight, and comment; but he has bitten off a great big chunk of subject matter for a very short book, and the strain is evident. The range of notable residents in the Isakon building is one of the things that makes the story so fascinating, but when you have this many significant figures in art, architecture, literature, and spycraft roosting in one place, you're simply not going to be able to do them justice in 225 lightly packed pages of text. It's only fair to point out that the book is a volume in Boydell's series ""History of British Intelligence,"" so naturally that's where the emphasis is going to be. Still, the book has a hurried and crowded feel. The cast of characters fairly whizzes by, and it's hard to get and keep everyone straight, even with the help of the Dramatis Personae in the front of the book. I also found the proliferation of acronyms--no doubt all in a day's work for intelligence specialists-quite dispiriting and a real hindrance to the book's flow.I hope at some point someone will write a good (and longer) book on the Isakon focused more closely on its architectural and cultural dimensions rather than on the revolving carousel of spies, interesting though the latter is. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Aug 23, 2016","Aug 23, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18234399-the-lawn-road-flats

Though not on a par with that classic, it similarly works on two levels. On the more serious of these, it's a compact and depressing survey of America's three-century-long, failed relationship with firearms. Peter Manseau has compiled brief newspaper accounts of gun mishaps dating back as far as the 1730s to demonstrate how little the ""melancholy accidents"" of the past differ from those occurring daily in the US today. On another level...well, it's the Darwin Awards in spades! People unintentionally shoot their brothers, sisters, parents, friends, horses, children, dogs--and, of course, themselves--in ways ranging from the unlucky to the idiotic. For pure gallows (or firing-squad) humor, the reports themselves are hard to beat, combining a scientific preoccupation with complex bullet trajectories, detailed descriptions of the physical damage to the deceased (""the gun discharged its contents into Mr. Bennett's head, blowing out his eyes and entering his skull""), pessimistic forecasts regarding any surviving victim (""a charge of shot lodged in one knee, and it is probably that it will have to be amputated""; ""Her physician thinks she cannot recover""), and maudlin poems. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jul 20, 2016","Jul 20, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25893767-melancholy-accidents

This is simply not true, and the more Scott argues for it the less I believe it. Authors (or filmmakers, or artists, or or or) don't *need* critics, however much critics might wish they did; and to suggest that the author (or filmmaker etc.) and the critic are locked in a symbiotic relationship strikes me as illogical and self-serving.Still, I can imagine how the idea would be appealing to you if you were a critic (or a translator).Considering what a generally appealing authorial voice Scott has, I also found it a perplexing misstep for him to include the several self-interviews he intersperses through the text. They don't come off charming; more like arch / twee. Overall, though, I'm very glad I read BETTER LIVING.

We don't need the Albert Speer to tell us that. What Hitler's uber-architekt and armaments minister *does* reveal in this creepily riveting--and sometimes shamefully funny--slab of a book is the degree to which the Fuehrer's inner circle behaved like bitchy little schoolgirls as they primped, flounced, bullied, and schemed furiously to see who could worm his way in closest to the Supreme Leader. Who dined with Hitler in his private quarters? Who received a signed photo for his birthday instead of just a boilerplate note? Whose weekend house had the largest picture window? (Answer to that one: Goering, and didn't that just get under the boss's skin?) Etc.Speer tries to intimate that he's on a rather higher plane than his Third Reich colleagues, set apart from the general conniving and intrigue; but since he can't help crowing whenever he confounds or outmaneuvers a rival, he's not much of a success in that regard. He pulls out all the stops in describing his Sydney Carton-like behavior at the Nuremberg trials--hey, he's ""the Nazi who apologized""!--but since he quotes lovingly and at considerable length from his own speechifying on the occasion, one is left with an impression of something less than humble self-sacrifice. Also he is quite withering about how fat Goering looked in the dock.Just how competitive were these people? Having been rounded up and imprisoned at the end of the war, they were then (inexplicably) subjected to intelligence testing by American officials.

Well, if you're Tracy Daugherty, you call it ""a literary biography."" The few individuals the author managed to interview first-hand for this book include such critically important sources as the people who bought Didion's Brentwood house (they found it somewhat rundown) and a ""former [movie] studio executive"" whose child(ren) attended the same school as Quintana Roo Dunne. Otherwise, it's a library / internet pasteup job all the way, as a quick perusal of the endless back-of-the-book annotation demonstrates. The resulting volume comprises a bunch of third-hand anecdotes that are as stale as last century's bread, and some insight-free literary and cultural commentary, dispensed in a tone of general disapprobation.If you're interested in the world's longest dentist's-office read and you're not too particular about style or originality, knock yourself out.

The book is shapeless and plodding, and not at all helped by a terrible translation boasting more cliches per page than anything I've ever read. It's clear that the author despises Riefenstahl, and she's got plenty of company there; but then why choose to write about her at all?

I did so initially because there's a character named Vandeleur in THE BLUE GUITAR, and I wanted to check back quickly and see whether there wasn't another character of the name in THE UNTOUCHABLE. (There is.) Then of course I found myself drawn back into the world of the older work, and began to read sections of the two books alternately. Probably this wasn't a good idea, or at least it didn't do my experience of THE BLUE GUITAR any good.THE UNTOUCHABLE is a truly great novel, and perhaps it's unfair to compare this new work to it; but THE BLUE GUITAR is so inferior as to seem the work of a Banville imitator. Yes, of course it's wonderful at the sentence level, and it does deal with the author's classic themes of art, inauthenticity, and the secret self; but in a way that's coarser and far more simplistic than in either THE UNTOUCHABLE or the novels of the Freddie Montgomery trilogy, or even the flawed SHROUD. There's a hint of desperation about this book, as though Banville were trying very hard (and failing) to regain the footing he found in his glorious middle-period novels. The ending in particular seems hasty and sheepish. I've heard that Banville has said this will be his last book, though I don't know (or care, really) whether this includes the Benjamin Black trifles. I never thought I would say it, but I really hope he doesn't write more if this is the sort of thing he'd be turning out.

He's not much of a stylist, and while I'm impressed by his ability to get inside and understand women's minds, that's not a quality that I value very much. (I particularly despise those ""three generations of women"" novels, which seem to be a genre all to themselves.) But NORA WEBSTER is different, and I was very much surprised to find myself so absorbed in it.I wasn't bowled over by BROOKLYN, which got fantastic s and is a great favorite of some of my friends. In a way, this book is much in the same mode, and yet it's not. Nothing particularly happens in it, and stylistically it's very plain. But Nora Webster is a fictional character I haven't really seen before. She is not a hand-wringer--far from it--though the book begins with the death of her much-loved husband. What she yearns for almost single-mindedly is solitude, which I suppose is both the inverse and parallel of loneliness. She's neither sodden with grief nor particularly noble; she just carries on. She is tired and irritated by the well-meaning neighbors and relatives who keep coming to her door to sympathize with her, and while she keeps a watchful eye on her children (who, by the way, are exceptionally well-drawn characters), she wishes very much for time away from them, all to herself. Gradually, though, the need for money drives her out of her house and into a workplace, and slowly this exposure to ordinary society takes her step by step into a new kind of life, one in which she makes some surprising discoveries about her own talents and abilities. I kept waiting for something awful to happen, as it seems at several points it might, but then...well, best not to spoil the story for others. In any case, a rather beautiful book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Oct 2014,"Oct 16, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/21412360-nora-webster

A fashion and society photographer of extraordinary skill and reputation, Cecil Beaton during a substantial parJust what you'd imagine, only more so. A fashion and society photographer of extraordinary skill and reputation, Cecil Beaton during a substantial part of the 20th century was liable to pop up anywhere famous, important, and/or fabulously wealthy people gathered. Didn't he just talk about it,too!As shown in these diaries, Beaton's cattiness exceeded the everyday by several orders of magnitude, and he frequently scratched the hand that fed him, at least in private. Those who were his targets were not merely skewered but charred to s crisp and slathered with barbecue sauce. Laurence Olivier was a talentless hack and Katherine Hepburn a monster with every possible thing wrong with her; various rich people had terrible taste and dressed horribly and were losing their looks and--even worse--were Americans. Luckily for the reader, many of the things Beaton says are absolutely hilarious. Some, though, are not, including several anti-Semitic comments, one of which--couched in a cartoon--got him fired from *Vogue*. His toadying up to royalty, too, particularly the Queen Mother, is rather sickening.Speaking of sickening: what a hypochondriac! Readers get to learn everything they ever wanted to know--and much, more--about the mutable state of Beaton's bowels, his many headaches, the boil on the end of his nose,his ever-shrinking penis, etc. Ignobly, he also spilled the beans in *McCall's* (I think) about his affair with Greta Garbo--for him, a rare excursion to the other side of the sexual fence. There was another, more appealing side to Beaton, though, and this too is on display in his diaries. He adored his house and garden and was childishly excited by the quotidian activities of trout and ducks on a pond he'd created. Surprisingly, he is shown to be something of a romantic, and his quest for love and connection--perhaps an old man's folly--is touching. He was also capable of loyalty to those he considered his friends, and even to some he didn't, like the Duke of Windsor, who, he claimed, never liked *him*.A rather complicated man, Cecil Beaton.

Five stars for the tale itself, which, while just one of countless treatments of the Cambridge spies, has never, as far as I know, been told in such great detail, and with such attention to collateral damage. In this case, the collateral damage includes not just the hundreds of people who were liquidated as a result of Philby's betrayals, but also the emotional and psychological destruction wrought upon his friends and family. In the case of Nicholas Elliott, probably Philby's closest friend (at least, that's what Elliott thought, for over thirty years) and the man who loved Kim Philby the most, the brutalization was insurmountable. It's hard to imagine anyone colder or more calculating than Philby, who used the affection of everyone who cared about him (and reportedly he was ultra-charming, so this would be many people, including four wives) as little more than a cloak to shield his furtive activities.Unfortunately, Ben Macintyre does not write very well, particularly toward the end of the book, where the prose becomes wildly redundant and purple. Yes, yes, everyone knows that Philby came from the upper classes, and had an Eton / Cambridge education, and belonged to exclusive clubs. We don't need Macintyre to tell us this a hundred times over, nor to reiterate endlessly that both MI6 and the CIA were old-boy's clubs, whereas MI5 and the FBI were essentially proles' guilds.

It would make the perfect accompaniment to a midnight road trip through a Louisiana bayou where you ran out of gas, sank into mud up to your wheel wells, were bitten by several cottonmouth moccasins and then had your throat slashed by swamp-dwelling sociopaths. Werner Herzog would STILL have bigger problems than you did. 2) Also Werner Herzog can't stand nature and isn't ashamed to tell you all about it at length and in a tone of horrified fascination. You have to respect that. Oh, sure, he'll pause periodically and go through the motions of extolling, e.g., the beauty of the Amazonian night sky (though in ""Burden of Dreams"" he even criticized that), but we all know what he's really thinking: Get me the fuck out of here! Every pig is a bag of bones, every dog has three legs, every spider is the size of Saturn, and everything everywhere is drenched and rotting and infected and teetering on the verge of death. The tale of the movie shoot is really great and all that, and I loved it. Still, anyone could dine out on stories about those little mountainside boat problems and trying to handle the head case that was Klaus Kinski. It takes a real man, though, to bitch about The Majestic World Around Us. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,Jun 2014,"Jun 17, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6004348-conquest-of-the-useless

Well, it has many of the same rapid-fire philosophical elements the three preceding books had, but somehow the Vladimir / Estragon - type relationship in those was much more entertaining and much less solipsistic. Wittgenstein, the one-note, sad-sack genius, becomes more than a tad irritating after a while, and the stupidities of the Cambridge students--exhibitionistic drunkenness, pointless sex, dullard attempts at satire and Deep Thoughts, late-in-the-game homoerotic love, etc--are every bit as tiresome as they are in university students everywhere.This book is unworthy of Lars Iyer.
