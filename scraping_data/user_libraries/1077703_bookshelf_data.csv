She returns to her Baltimore (and its suburbs) setting and features the same type of eccentric, slightly dysfunctional while still likable and sympathetic characters. I like her narrative arcs, spanning multiple generations, and how she depicts their interactions. Her eye for detail and spot-on insights leave me in awe sometimes. There was one scene, however, which left me a little cold and disapproving. However, I didn't let it interfere with my overall reading pleasure.

I once saw his Of Mice and Men enacted on the stage in Turkey. In this book, Charley is Steinbeck's mature French poodle who makes for a sturdy travel buddy. Steinbeck travels west, starting at his home in New York City. I must say some of his trip decisions are real headscratchers (which ones I won't play spoiler and mention here). But his dry, self-deprecating sense of humor and his keen insights about where he goes and who he meets win me over to his side. The year is 1960 with the presidential campaigns of JFK and Nixon in full swing. Steinbeck doesn't shy away from taking on heavy topics like racial strife and climate change. He also gets lost easily, even in the places where he has been previously.

The claustrophobic confines of life aboard a submarine intrigued me. I finally got around to reading the novel all these years later. It was a humdinger for me. Rousing battle scenes, lots of technical details about diesel-powered submarines, and even a sprinkling of romance. The time period of the 1940s and World War Two appeals to me. The novel has a few things (stilted prose, lots of exclamation marks, etc.) I didn't prefer, but they didn't dilute my reading enjoyment.

It's strange to imagine Lincoln as the Perry Mason of his time and accepting a murder case. Much of the testimony was recorded by a courtroom stenographer, an emerging feature of trials.

Parker's PI Spenser series is one of the classics. I found this title entertaining and fun with a few surprising plot twists. Spenser and his sidekick Hawk don't shy away from violence. His girlfriend Susan Silverman is somehow very understanding of his unsettling profession. The literary and pop culture references sprinkled into the prose are distracting. If you don't get it, you can keep on reading. Some of the prose is transcendent in the literary sense.

It's probably half about Hedy and the other half is about her inventor partner George Antheil, a talented composer and writer. They developed and patented a radio frequency hopping technology during the Second World War. The sections describing it are technical, and I could follow the gist of it. However, both of their lives were colorful and turbulent, especially Hedy's. She was so much more than just another ""pretty face"" in the Hollywood movies, as this book convincingly and amply demonstrates. Her patented invention had important long-term benefits.

Of course many of the women spies/saboteurs were never recognized for their heroic efforts. I also learned about what Vichy France was during the war. All in all, the book held my attention on an important topic. ...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Jan 16, 2020","Jan 20, 2020","Jan 16, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/41449260-d-day-girls

Its founder and lead singer Jeff Tweedy writes a funny, irreverent, and honest memoir. I like his discussions about how his family is the glue that keeps him together through his opiates addiction, depression episodes, migraine headaches. His songwriting sections are fascinating. Plus, I'm now a fan of his first rock group, Uncle Tupelo. ...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Jan 16, 2020","Jan 18, 2020","Jan 16, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/40780934-let-s-go-so-we-can-get-back

The lives of the enslaved people serving the four presidents is interesting, much of it new to me. I haven't read too many YA books, so I can't really speak to that part. The broader issue of slavery is also dealt with, and the timelines are helpful.
