He had only one name for these two kinds Well, it's long.Personal quotes:Sometimes he would dig in his garden, and sometimes he would read and write. He had only one name for these two kinds of work: gardening. ""The spirit is a garden,"" he said. (18)...we might say that success is a hideous thing. Its false similarity to merit deceives men... Success, that pretender to talent, has a dupe--history... (51)...the white skin here and there showing the azure arborescence of veins... (126)Curiosity is gluttony. To see is to devour. (191)Though we chisel away as best we can at the mysterious block from which our life is made, the black vein of destiny continually reappears. (203)To see a thousand objects for the first and last time, what could be more profoundly melancholy? Traveling is a constant birth and death. (248)Such is Waterloo.But what difference does it make to the Infinite? This entire tempest, this vast cloud, this war, then this peace, all of this darkness, do not disturb for one moment the light of that infinite Eye, before which the smallest insect leaping from one blade of grass to another equals the eagle flying from spire to spire among the towers of Notre-Dame. (352)An army is a strange composite masterpiece, in which strength results from an enormous sum total of utter weaknesses. (368-9)Symmetry is boredom, the quintessence of mourning. Despair yawns. There is something more terrible than a hell of suffering--a hell of boredom. (432)On the first goblet he read the inscription ""monkey wine,"" on the second ""lion wine,"" on the third ""sheep wine,"" on the fourth ""swine wine."" These four inscriptions expressed the four descending degrees of drunkenness: the first, which enlivens; the second, which irritates; the third, which stupefies; finally the last, which brutalizes. (504)What power there is in courteous and serious examination! Let us not carry flame where light alone will suffice. (514)Self sacrifice, even when misdirected, is still self-sacrifice. To assume as duty a strict error has its peculiar grandeur. (522)""....Stat crux dum volvitur orbis."" ""Amen,"" said Fauchelevent, imperturbable in this method of extricating himself whenever he heard any Latin.Poverty in youth, when it succeeds, is magnificent in that it turns the whole will toward effort and the whole soul toward aspiration...[more]"" (685)The soul that loves ans suffers in the sublime state. (863)The power of a glance has been so much abused in love stories that it has come to be disbelieved. Few people dare say nowadays that two beings have fallen in love because they have looked at each other. Yet that is the way love begins, and only that way. The rest is only the rest, and comes afterwards. Nothing is more real than the great shocks that two souls give each other in exchanging this spark. (896)From the political point of view, there is one single principle: the sovereignty of man over himself. [more on Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, and Society; plus education] (1190-1191)In extreme case, we may introduce the reader into a nuptial chamber, but not into a virgin's bedroom. Verse would hardly dare, prose should not. (1204)You have the power to throw away this wealth, and to think me ridiculous into the bargain. That will be crowning glory of your ignorance. (1257)There are things we should not undertake to paint; the sun is among them. (1343)The limbs, without parting from the trunk, recede from it. It is not their fault. Youth goes where joy is, to festivals, to brilliant lights, to loves.

Everything is measured by after.A man walks from the ash and destruction of the Twin Towers, and returns to his wife, from whom he had recently separated, and child. Falling Man, by heavyweight Don DeLillo, seeks to tackle 9-11 head on. We train with terrorists, fly in the airplanes; we descend the smoky stairs; we meet other survivors; most importantly, we remember.At one point, toward the end of the book, some time after the attacks, the family of three takes part in an anti-war March. A man comes up, incongruously announcing that today’s Charlie Parker’s birthday. The same day, the boy says that the best thing he ever learned in school was that the sun is a star.It was amazing in a way, what he’d said, one sentence, five words, and think of everything it says about everything there is. The sun is a star. When did she realize this herself and why didn’t she remember when. The sun is a star. It seemed a revelation, a fresh way to think about being who we are, the purest way and only finally unfolding, a kind of mystical shiver, an awakening…That night…she took a jazz encyclopedia down from the dusty upper shelves and there it was, in six-point type, not only the year but the month and the day.

There was a general agreement that, in nearly 400 pages of blind mayhem, we were not completely invested in the characters. They remained one (or is it two?) dimensional, never enlarging into the seemingly living, breathing, (volume-taking) form that our favorite literary figures must take. This idea of character leads me to the amazing National Book Award-winning book by Colum McCann, Let the Great World Spin. Somehow, in just a few paragraphs (or sentences even), the dozen or so central characters in this sprawling book come alive. The book is really 13 interlinked short stories, most of them narrated first person by a different character. In lesser hands, this approach could easily feel gimmicky. But McCann’s brilliant, often nearly-poetic, writing allows each chapter to work. And that each chapter ties in beautifully (i.e. subtly) to the central story (Philippe Petit's 1974 high-wire walk between the WTC towers) reveals McCann’s skill as a writer. It’s not an easy book to explain. It’s about love and loss (not necessarily in that order). It’s about redemption. It’s about the potential heights of mans’ greatness (Petit’s walk), and the potential depths of his sin (a photo that shows Petit walking the tightrope also shows a plane near the edge of the photo seemingly streaking toward one of the towers). It’s about interconnectedness.An Irishman visits his brother in the Bronx and experiences America.“You asked me if I’m using heroin, man?” He was laughing, but looking out the bar window at the rafters of the highway. “It’s worse than that, brother, much worse.”Mothers mourn the losses of sons (the Vietnam War is recently past).An artist comes to terms with lost love, and, perhaps, found love.There are rocks deep enough in this earth that no matter what the rupture, they will never see the surface.There is, I think, a fear of love.There is a fear of love.A Bronx hooker wonders what’s next after the loss of her daughter. Her language comes alive:I had legs a hundred miles long and a booty to die for. Adam woulda said to Eve, Eve, I’m leaving you, honey, and Jesus himself woulda been in the background saying, Adam, you’re one lucky motherfucker.And so on. If the book sounds sad, it is, at times. But the end is triumphant (and that gives nothing away). If the book sounds amazing, it is that, too.More quotes (for my own recollection):You want to arrest the clocks, stop everything for half a second, give yourself a chance to do it over again, rewind the life, uncrash the car, run it backward, have her lift miraculously back into the windshield, unshatter the glass, go about your day untouched, some old, lost sweet-tasting time.But it struck me, as I sketched, that all I wanted to do was to walk out into a clean elsewhere.They buried her two days later in a plot near the back of their old house. She had told Jaslyn once that everyone knows where they are from when they know where it is they want to be buried. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Apr 13, 2010","Apr 26, 2010","Feb 05, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5941033-let-the-great-world-spin

An absolute guilty pleasure, but a pleasure indeed.Some quotes:Claude, about work:“…I think it’s incredibly important to have real work…It doesn’t matter what it is, just so it’s something that tests you, so when you go forward you grow. A lot of people seem to go around in circles.”About a past love:In the complicated equation of her life, he was no longer a factor.About going to the movies:If he was nothing, or almost nothing, with no idea of where he had come from or where he was going, why he was living or what he was supposed to be doing (the piano only an elusive hint), and if, further, he was buffeted by forces he could not name but which were loneliness, sadness, longing, fear, and spiritual nausea, would he not deeply attend the infinite story of life?

It won the prestigious Whitbread Book of the Year Award and was shortlisted for the Booker Prize. It most certainly hinted at what was to come, namely Ishiguro’s next book and masterwork, The Remains of the Day. Set in post-WW II Japan, Floating World is about Ono, an aging Japanese painter. Ono and, in particular, his paintings were at the forefront of Japanese imperialism prior to WW II. In Ishiguro’s unmistakable and unparalleled first person narrative, Ono reflects on his choices as he surveys the changes to his country—the destruction, the maturation and marriages of his daughters, and the deaths of his wife and son. The books is not as brilliantly subtle as some of Ishiguro’s other works, nor is there a sense of the looming disaster (always a disaster of the past) that gives his other books such propulsive momentum.

Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood.Angela’s Ashes, Frank McCourt’s amazing, Pulitzer-Prize-winning memoir, is about more than overcoming the innocence of youth and the pains of poverty. It’s about an unwavering love of family and a relentless drive to pursue a dream. If that sounds too Disney for you, then you don’t know about World War II-era Limerick, Ireland. Frank quickly brings you into his terrible world, and amazingly makes you want to stick it out with him. And perhaps the greatest miracle of this book is how funny it can be, even in the face of the most horrible poverty imaginable.

The book’s importance is well-known, as is its story. I offer some of my favorite passages:The sun is shining, the sky is deep blue, there’s a magnificent breeze, and I’m longing—really longing—for everything: conversation, freedom, friends, being alone. I long ... to cry! I feel as if I were about to explode. I know crying would help, but I can’t cry. I’m restless. I walk from one room to another, breathe through the crack in the window frame, feel my heart beating as if to say, “Fulfill my longing at last...”At such moments I don’t think about all the misery, but about the beauty that still remains. This is where Mother and I differ greatly. Her advice in the face of melancholy is: “Think about all the suffering in the world and be thankful you’re not part of it.” My advice is: “Go outside, to the country, enjoy the sun and all nature has to offer. Go outside and try to recapture the happiness within yourself; think of all the beauty in yourself and in everything around you and be happy.It’s utterly impossible for me to build my life on a foundation of chaos, suffering and death. I see the world being slowly transformed into a wilderness, I hear the approaching thunder that, one day, will destroy us too, I feel the suffering of millions. And yet, when I look up at the sky, I somehow feel that everything will change for the better, that this cruelty too will end, that peace and tranquility will return once more.This last passage was written two weeks before she was captured, and less than a year before she died at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp (in 1945).

Jacobs, editor at large at Esquire Magazine, is about a man attempting to follow all of the rules of the Bible for one year. The memoir is an enjoyable read, particularly the early chapters that deal with the Old Testament. (He got away from his central mission during the rushed New Testament sections. Was he on a deadline? Even the editing fell apart at the end.) That the man is a left-leaning, culturally Jewish (but not practicing), agnostic New Yorker is certainly the best reason to read the book. In other words, it’s frequently funny. For example:An atheist club felt oxymoronic, like an apathy parade.There’s not a hell (I mean heck) of a lot else to take from the book; although one might consider (or reconsider) the value of some of the Bible’s laws (Wouldn’t a weekly Sabbath be kind of nice? No emails? No cell phones? No Facebook? I do believe there’s value in that.). I think most of us know already that many of the Bible’s laws are either ridiculous or (if you’re more religious than I) not to be taken literally. (Jacobs does manage to stone an adulterer, for example, but he uses pebbles.) Besides its entertainment value, I suppose some might enjoy the book as a nice Bible refresher (Jacobs utilized a broad group of spiritual advisers), but the author sets out, I believe, to entertain.I found the following excerpts interesting.In discussing the Bible’s commandment to avoid imagery:...I think there’s something to the idea that the divine dwells more easily in text than in images. Text allows for more abstract thought, more of a separation between you and the physical world, more room for you and God to meet in the middle. I find it hard enough to conceive of an infinite being. Imagine if those original scrolls came in the form of a graphic novel with pictures of the Lord? I’d never come close to communing with the divine.On humans being made in God’s image:...if triangles could think, their God would be eminently triangular. -SpinozaFrom one of his religious advisers:Whenever you’re sad, things aren’t working out for you, look around, see if there’s someone else in trouble, go and help them.

Not unlike Kazuo Ishiguro (especially in his futuristic Never Let Me Go), the skein of Atwood’s dystopian world, as woven in the limited-omniscient point of view of the Handmaid, Offred, unwinds slowly and deliberately. This creates a haunting world, one whose peripheries are blurry, whose wire-pullers seem faceless and nearly invisible, whose history and future are distorted and bleak.Offred is a Handmaid, whose sole purpose, like all Handmaids, in this futuristic, tyrannical and nearly infertile Republic of Gilead is to become pregnant. One of Atwood’s most interesting and effective decisions was to write the book mostly in present tense. Subconsciously (or consciously), without an apparent (or guaranteed) place of refuge to put down her words, as she must have if the book were written in past tense, Offred leaves the reader questioning her own survival.

On those occasions that she broke down and let me wear the best hat, she insisted on my wearing a bag over it until I was safely at my destination.

One of the longest books in the English language (at over 1,000 word-packed pages), and necessarily so. Much of the book’s appeal comes from the feeling of time passing (literally). The book spans 15 years or so—from shortly before the Civil War to near the end of the South’s Reconstruction—with no jumps in time that I can recall. And the time is spent almost entirely with our heroine, Scarlett O’hara. And this, in the end, is why the book failed to live up to its promise as “the epic novel of our time.” I just couldn’t get over the fact that Scarlett is one of the most unlikable, stubborn, selfish, parsimonious, superficial protagonists in literature. That I had to spend so much time with her was unfortunate. Allow me to make a two-part hypothesis: (1) Scarlett was softened-up a bit in the movie (which I have not yet seen) and (2) a huge majority of the people who praise GWTW are referring to the movie and maybe have not read the book (a halo effect, perhaps). This book is well written. Mitchell has impressive “chops” for someone writing her first novel. Given the length of the book, inconsistencies are not surprising (and are perhaps forgivable). Why a half-page description of a house or person on one page and nary an adjective for something or someone of tantamount importance many pages later? I guess that’s part of the risk of embarking on a project this substantial.In any case, it’s certainly not a bad book. The flow of the plot is as readily adaptable to the screen as any book you’ll read (you’d think Mitchell wrote with thoughts of selling the screen rights). And the cast of characters is dazzling. It’s just that one character scurrying about on every page that lost it for me.As a side note, my Avon Books edition (circa 1973, I believe) had a comical number of typos (literally dozens). The most glaring was the misspell of a person’s name—on facing pages! Very surprising for a classic book written 40+ years prior.

It descends on you, like a hurricane.This is a very good book. Shriver writes with amazing intelligence and wit, much in the style of Zadie Smith or Rushdie; I was quite surprised that she, a resident of London, was North-Carolina-born and Columbia-schooled: she has a British way of writing.The properties of repetition, she considered, were complex. Up to a point, repetition was a magnifier, and elevated habit to ritual. Taken too far, it could grow erosive, and grind to the mindless and rote. In kind, the pound of surf, depending on the tides, could either deposit sand on the shore, or wear it away.Her English dialogue is spot on as well, as far as my American (inner)ears can tell.The Post-Birthday World is about the romantic choices we make, and their consequences. Without giving away the premise, let's just say it explores these themes in a way unlike any book I know. Should she choose the stable, supportive, attractive bore, with whom a night of television is the norm?Night after night they propped stuporously in their appointed seats, both glad of such a miraculous object--one that facilitated spending hours at a go in the same room without speaking, and at once cast this catatonic antisocial behavior as perfectly normal.Or the rich, attractive, often-absent snooker player?Desire is its own reward, and a rarer luxury than you'd think. You could sometimes buy what you wanted; you could never buy wanting it.She wanted the snooker star.Any complaints? This is a long book, and I wish Shriver could trim the fat here and there. In spite of her skill as a writer--or perhaps because of it--she tends to overwrite.

Is it too much detail, perhaps, such that the mind cannot hold onto the essence of the words? Or perhaps it's simply the story and the characters have failed to dig deeply enough into my memory, to plant a root invulnerable to the winds of time, not to mention the blowings of future readings and their many-splendored characters and stories. The Yiddish Policeman's Union strikes me as a book that I will some day forget, but it's a very good read none the less.It took me a while to really get into it. A number of characters with difficult names, combined with numerous Yiddish words (I wish I new about the glossary at the back of the book before I got there), not to mention my own schedule, which prevented unencumbered and consistent reading sessions, lead to a slow-go at the start. But as I started to care for homicide detective Landsman and the case of the murdered former chess prodigy, my interest grew. Chabon is a gifted writer, as anyone who has read The Amazing Adventures of Cavalier and Clay already knows. For example, when Landsman runs into his ex-wife: “He tries and fails not to observe the way her heavy breasts, each of whose moles and freckles he can still project like constellations against the planetarium dome of his imagination, strain against the placket and pockets of her shirt.”This is a good book, and while perhaps I'll forget about it in due time, I would recommend it....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jun 15, 2009","Jun 09, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16703.The_Yiddish_Policemen_s_Union

Perhaps Nabokov has too much fun from time to time. But when an absolute master of language combines intelligence, wit and imagination as Nabokov can and does in Pale Fire, you get a rollicking, if occasionally intricate, good time. For example, the narrator, in his commentating of a certain poet's use of the name “Lolita” for a hurricane:Major hurricanes are given feminine names in America. The feminine gender is suggested not so much by the sex of furies and harridans as by a general professional application. Thus any machine is a she to its fond user, and any fire (even a “pale” one!) is she to the fireman, as water is she to the passionate plumber. Why our poet chose to give his 1958 hurricane a little-used Spanish name (sometimes given to parrots) instead of Linda or Lois, is not clear.Too much fun, indeed! Read this book.

As the title implies, this is a day-in-the-life story. No question, McEwan's greatest strength is his ability to pull us into Henry Perowne’s world. Because we care so deeply for Henry and his family, portrayed with striking tenderness and realism, we can feel the intensity of the two confrontations with Baxter. We are shaken. We feel the family’s horror, which is essential because it allows us to consider their actions afterward. To create such intensity of fear for the reader takes amazing literary skill.There are so many ideas floating around this short book that it is difficult to keep track of them all, yet the book never feels moralistic, preachy or dense. The most obvious idea looks into our attitude toward terrorism (the book is set post 9/11 but just before the Iraq war). Could Baxter’s break-in and attack not be synonymous to the 9/11 attacks? As readers, we feel the fear and then the anger that Henry’s family feels as their world is attacked. And the way Henry deals with Baxter after the incident allows us to consider our own potential reactions. These are not easy issues to write about, and McEwan does so brilliantly.McEwan also gets into ideas of progress (technological and otherwise). The scrupulously detailed description of neurosurgery displays science at its greatest. But we also see the limitations of science, how neurosurgery cannot change behavior or how an overly scientific view of the world (such as Henry’s) can be dangerous. The portrayal of art is also important. Notice that Henry finds his greatest peace while listening to his son play guitar, and of course poetry plays a central role in the temporary “healing” of Baxter.McEwan never attempts to answer the difficult questions, but by laying them bare in a recognizable setting, he gives us opportunity to provide our own answers.

Clare is frequently the destination of these travels. There is much to praise about this enjoyable page turner. To begin with, Niffenegger was as scrupulous as one could be dealing with the impossible dilemmas of time travel. Most notably, she gives the time-traveling Henry a sort of limited freewill. He is not able to do or say anything that would “dramatically” alter the future. Thus, Niffenegger avoids the pitfalls of eliminating causation from her literary world. (That Henry buys a winning lottery ticket and gives frequent stock advice are perhaps the books greatest faults.)The episodes where Henry visits his past selves are excellent. In the following, an older, time-traveling Henry reveals a scar to his younger self, revealing his identity for the first time:“It’s just like mine,” says my self, amazed. “How did you get it?”“The same as you. It is the same. We are the same.”A translucent moment. I didn’t understand, and then I did, just like that. I watch it happen. I want to be both of us at once, feel again the feeling of losing the edges of my self, of seeing the admixture of future and present for the first time. But I’m too accustomed, too comfortable with it, and so I am left on the outside, remembering the wonder of being nine and suddenly seeing, knowing, that my friend, guide, brother was me. Me, only me. The loneliness of it.Niffenegger is a talented and skillful writer, if not a consistent one. I enjoyed this description of dawn, as described by Clare:The world was gray. Slowly color leaks into it, not rosy-fingered but like a slowly spreading stain of blood orange, one moment lingering at the horizon and then flooding the garden and then golden light, and then a blue sky, and then all the colors vibrant in their assigned places, the trumpet vines, the roses, the white salvia, the marigolds, all shimmering in the new morning dew like glass. The silver birches at the edges of the woods dangle like white strings suspended from the sky. A crow flies across the grass. Its shadow flies under it, and meets it as it lands under the window and caws, once. Light finds the window, and creates my hands, my body heavy in Mama’s white chair. The sun is up.I would admit that such eloquence is infrequent and, thus perhaps, seemed like exercise. Professorly. A more consistent effort is hopefully in store (this was her first book).We know how this book will end. The rules of Niffenegger's universe are set. Outcomes foretold. And we are left with questions. Can love be timeless? Does love exist beyond the physical, beyond the now, as Henry and Clare’s love extends like an unbroken ribbon through the pages of the book? Should love be timeless, or should lovers, when physically torn apart, just move on?...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Sep 21, 2009","Mar 25, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/14050.The_Time_Traveler_s_Wife

All of this is intended, I am sure, to create just the effect that Didion had in mind: to make us understand Mariah’s condition (as a miserably-depressed, struggling actress in the midst of a divorce and considering an abortion for an unwanted baby--oh yeah: and her daughter is in an insane asylum--sounds like a fun read, huh?). The book is short. While on one hand, I was happy to leave the troubled world of Maria so quickly, on the other, I thought character development suffered. With the obvious exception of Maria, the characters were silhouettes; I never really got to know or care for any of them. A related issue was Didion’s lack of setting exposition. Her obvious personal knowledge of Southern California (to be sure, some of the strongest parts of the book were her accurate descriptions of endless freeway driving) seemed wasted by her decision to forego detailed descriptions and colorings. Its brevity, I think, made it seem a minor effort. I do recommend rereading the first three chapters after completing the book. I found them more effective and illuminating after I got to know the characters....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Mar 11, 2009","Feb 20, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/428.Play_It_As_It_Lays

I have no such ambition, or no such hope.Perhaps I write for no one. Perhaps for the same person children are writing for, when they scrawl their names in the snow.A serious effort. I counted no fewer than six narrative threads: the narrator as an ""old woman""; flashbacks to the time around WWII; flashbacks to the time around WWI, before the narrator was born; The Blind Assassin (novel withing the novel); the science fiction story within the novel within the novel; and the newspaper/magazine articles. If that all sounds confusing, it is not really. I found it an enjoyable read. I'm a fan of metafiction, and if you are too, then The Blind Assassin is highly recommended.**spoiler alert**It's difficult to talk about this book without spoiling it. First of all, this was a sad book; not necessarily depressing; just sad. My favorite books typically have sympathetic characters. The Blind Assassin did not. Iris, of course, is as close as we come to someone to ""root for,"" and I thought her present-day ruminations on her own aging and inevitable death were the strongest parts of the book. On the other hand, she's kind of an old, bitter hag, unappreciative of those who try to help her.I had some problems with the novel within the novel. First of all, it's not that good (particular the science fiction parts, which I'm sure are filled with symbols and omens but to me were not much fun). I know the task of writing two fine novels in one must have been difficult, but Atwood ran into what I will call the Mr.-Holland's-Opus dilemma. If you're going to display art that is supposed be exceptional (or classical, or popular, and so on) within a primary art, it better be damn good. The Blind Assassin by Laura Chase was not. Another problem; it becomes clear that Laura could not have written this book--she's not a writer; not even much of a reader, as far as we know. (In fact, that was my biggest clue that she did not write it.) But could Iris have written this? I kept waiting for a passionate discovery of the written word, and perhaps in the two years after Laura's death there was one. But if two years was enough time to become a novelist--a famous novelist--then I'd start trying. (Maybe it is--maybe I should start).Of course, the book is mostly great. (I did give in four stars.) Iris's use of The Blind Assassin to describe her affair is brilliant, particularly in hindsight. The writing is exceptional throughout. Another taste: Now she imagines him dreaming. She imagines him dreaming of her, as she is dreaming of him. Through a sky the colour of wet slate they fly towards each other on dark invisible wings, searching, searching, doubling back, drawn by hope and longing, baffled by fear. In their dreams they touch, they intertwine, it's more like a collision, and that is the end of the flying. They fall to earth, fouled parachutists, botched and cindery angels, love streaming out behind them like torn silk. Enemy groundfire comes up to meet them.While there may be some flaws, The Blind Assassin is a lot of fun, and certainly discussion-worthy....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Mar 02, 2009","Feb 01, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/78433.The_Blind_Assassin

It’s a book about real people, about loneliness, about falling into the rut of establishment, about letting go of our dreams, and, of course, about life in suburbia. Yates’s writing is confident, particularly the smoothness with which he moves from present (1950’s New York suburbs) to past. The lives of the common family man, the suburbanite, come alive:How small and neat and comically serious the other men looked, with their gray-flecked crew cuts and their button-down collars and their brisk little hurrying feet! There were endless desperate swarms of them, hurrying through the station and the streets, and an hour from now they would all be still. The waiting midtown office buildings would swallow them up and contain them, so that to stand in one tower looking out across the canyon to another would be to inspect a great silent insectarium displaying hundreds of tiny pink men in white shirts, forever shifting papers and frowning into telephones, acting out their passionate little dumb show under the supreme indifference of the rolling spring clouds. Of course, Yates’s Frank Wheeler is one of them. Of course, so are we, each in our own way. The themes of Revolutionary Road—adultery and the unhappiness of marriage; alcoholism; paradise lost (or never found) in our own backyards—are not new. But Yates was one of the first. And while the book is exceptional, the timing of the book undoubtedly played an important role in its designation as a classic. The influence of Yates, along with such 1960’s writers as Richard Ford, John Updike, and John Cheever, is hard to overstate (think Philip Roth (“American Pastoral”), Raymond Carver, and Tom Perotta (“Little Children”), to name just a few). Yates’s decision to write not about the exotic or strange but about the hackneyed and mundane was, in its time, groundbreaking. And the body of outstanding work that has ridden the wake of Revolutionary Road reveals its importance. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Nov 17, 2009","Jan 18, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/48328.Revolutionary_Road

Was Vonnegut out of ideas? Or perhaps he just wanted to write an autobiography. It’s hard to argue with him, in either case. I happen to love Vonnegut, so an autobiography not so cleverly disguised as science fiction is fine with me. He leaves me no shortage of quotes to share:I do not propose to discuss my love life. I will say that I still can’t get over how women are shaped, and that I will go to my grave wanting to pet their butts and boobs.

But after I had a character change and/or learn something and/or apologize, that left the cast standing around with their thumbs up their asses. That is no way to tell a reader the show is over.

He makes it easy for us to get taken away by the apparent verisimilitude of the main story, which is in the form of a non-fiction analysis of a movie called The Navidson Record--a documentary about one scary fucking house. There are two other narratives that work their ways through the book. These do not work nearly as well as the main narrative. The story of Johnny Truant, the man who finds the materials that describe The Navidson Record, falls a little flat for me. I'm not sure I really cared about Johnny.

She writes nearly a novel a year, and has been doing so since her first novel, With ShudderiJoyce Carol Oates is a prolific writer, to say the least. She writes nearly a novel a year, and has been doing so since her first novel, With Shuddering Fall, in 1964. One might, thus, expect her novels to have characteristic shortness or, worse, perhaps even a shallowness or transience. There is something about reading one of an author’s very few works—an inherent importance or significance, deserved or not. Earnest Hemingway, for example, published only seven novels in the 26 years following The Sun Also Rises (1926). J.D. Salinger of course published only one novel (The Catcher in the Rye, 1951). These novels seem to carry a profundity, manifested at least in part, I guiltily admit, by the short oeuvre on each one’s opening page. So what to make of Oates’s novel #37? The Gravedigger’s Daughter is not short; it does not feel rushed; and it is certainly not light:…as Tignor fumbled to open his trousers, fumbled to push himself into her more tentatively at first than he’d done in Beardstown, in a muffled choked voice murmuring what might have been Rebecca’s name; and Rebecca shut her eyes tighter for her thoughts were scattering like panicked birds before the wrath of hunters as their explosive shots filled the air and the birds fled skyward for their lives and she was seeing again her father’s face realizing for the first time it was a skin-mask, a mask of skin and not a face, she saw his mad eyes that were her own, saw his tremulous hands and for the first time too it came to her I must take it from him, that’s what he wants of me, he has called me to him for this, to take his death from him. Yet she did not. She was paralyzed, she could not move. She watched as he managed to maneuver the bulky shotgun around in that tight space, to aim at himself, and pull the trigger. Tignor groaned, as if struck by a mallet. Despite Oates obvious skill as a writer, the effort at times feels uneven. Take the 335-page, 45-chapter first part of the book. Oates puts considerable time an energy constructing Rebecca’s troubled youth. I do you a favor by saying: skip it. It’s dark and not that much fun. To summarize: Her dad’s a nutcase. And the rest of her family is not too far behind. I should also add that it’s not a good idea to marry a man on your third date when he beats you up on your second.The rest of the book explores, at times brilliantly, issues of identity. You see, Rebecca’s family may or may not have been Jews escaping from Germany shortly before the start of WW II. Not even Rebecca knows. And does it matter? Well, I suppose that is the question. Oates completes the book, questionably, with a new, metafictional section and a new character, who is really an old character, who may or may not be the author herself.

Up to this point of the novel, I kept thinking that the book was good, sometimes very good, but I often felt as though I’d read it before. The author’s descriptions of nature, use of archaic vocabulary (footnotes would have been great; I’m sure Penguin will come around to it some day), and overall stylistic approach, particularly in how he uses metaphors to create a macabre mood piece, reminded me of Cormac McCarthy (not necessarily a bad thing, but the book certainly lacked a feeling of newness). That is, until “The Doing of It,” and the wonderful chapters that follow. At this point in the book, language and character combined to create a story.

The horror of venturing into the pitch-black storeroom was an important thematic point of the book, as the doctor’s wife got a painful taste of the blindness that had struck the rest of the world. Lucky for Saramago, she didn’t simply return to the main store to find a candle or a flashlight (useless items to a blind person). (And lucky for the doctor’s wife she literally stumbled across a book of matches in the basement storeroom.) A scene such as this ruins a movie.The book is certainly not all bad. The premise is sort of a combination of The Stand, The Road, and Lord of the Flies. While Blindness is not nearly as effective as these classics (The Road is already one, I presume), it has its moments. Perhaps Saramago’s occasionally affecting prose is the books strongest point:She did not waste time asking herself where such a thought had come from, she was only surprised at its slowness, at how the first word had been so slow in appearing, the slowness of those to follow, and how she found that the thought was already there before, somewhere or other, and only the words were missing, like a body searching in the bed for the hollow that had been prepared for it by the mere idea of lying down.Saramago frequently uses commas in place of periods and capital letters (instead of quotes or paragraphs) to signify new speakers. It worked for the most part but at times was a little difficult.This is book is not a waste a time, but time could be better spent.As a postscript, I couldn’t resist printing the publisher’s unfortunate final note:The translator died before completing his revision of this translation. The Publishers acknowledge the help of Margaret Jull Costa in fulfilling this task.(So I must ask: is Miss Costa wanted as an accomplice to murder?) ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jun 03, 2009","Dec 31, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4307454-blindness

I wonder how someone can get this good, how one can acquire a vocabulary such as his, can know the land so profoundly, can understand the dialog so intimately and I assume accurately. ""He looked up. His pale hair looked white. He looked fourteen going on some age that never was. He looked as if he'd been sitting there and God had made the trees and rocks around him. He looked like his own reincarnation and then his own again. Above all else he looked to be filled with a terrible sadness. As if he harbored news of some horrendous loss that no one else had heard of yet. Some vast tragedy not of fact or incident or event but of the way the world was.""Yes, this book is dark. Darker even than his more recent and more popular works: The Road and No Country for Old Men. When you get past his consistently brilliant prose and technique, he offers you very little in way of comfort. I felt multiple times as if he engendered my trust, drew me in, and then sucker punched me in the solar plexus. One must think hard before entering the world of McCarthy.

To compare the two: I knew the conclusions were different, but what surprised me was, with the exception of a condensed march to Dunkirk in the movie, how exacting the movie followed the book. McEwan must have had some serious pull. The ending: I guess the movie did what it could, considering the book concludes with nearly 20 pages of first-person narrative. Perhaps I interpreted the movie incorrectly, but I assumed Briony was a deeply unhappy woman at the end (I assumed, for example, that the pills she took before her interview were antidepressants). She seemed quite alone. This is the most significant difference between movie and book. The book Briony, while clearly alone in life, nonetheless enjoyed a company of family in the final pages. We also learn of her recently passed husband--she had not lived an ascetic life of writing, as I somehow thought the movie Briony had. For these reasons, I prefer the book version--the movie conclusion was a downer (not that the book version made me want to throw a party).Comparisons aside (I thought the movie very good), this is one hell of a book.

Heat Moon's knowledge of the land, his easy understanding of the people he meets, and his impressive ability to make the land and people come alive in language, make this an excellent book.I offer the following quotes mostly for my own record keeping, but enjoy:As his journey begins: ""Etymology: curious, related to cure, once meant carefully observant. Maybe a tonic of curiosity would counter my numbing sense that life inevitably creeps toward the absurd.""""You never feel better than when you start feeling good after you've been feeling bad.""""The wanderer's danger is to find comfort. A weekend in Shreveport around friends, and security had started to pull me into a warm thrall, to enfold me, to make the wish for the road a craziness. So it was only the memory of times in strange places where the scent of the unknown is sharp that drew me on to the highway again.""A nonreligious but humble observer: ""My rambling metaphysics was getting caught in the trap of reducing experience to coherence and meaning, letting the perplexity of things disrupt the joy in their mystery. To insist that diligent thought would bring an understanding of change was to limit life to the comprehensible."" ""Maybe experience is like a globe--you can't go the wrong way if you travel far enough.""""But the Spider Grandmother did give two rules. To all men, not just Hopis. If you look at them, they cover everything. She said, 'Don't go around hurting each other,' and she said, 'Try to understand things.'""Somewhere in North Dakota; I think I've been here a few times: ""In a hotel room at the geographical center of North America, a neon sign blinking red through the cold curtains, I lay quietly like a small idea in a vacant mind.""Heat-Moon separated from his wife shortly before his journey. After dropping off a hitchhiker somewhere in Wisconsin, he offers a metaphor, perhaps: ""Ghost Dancing seemed empty, and I was lonely as I was after every rider left who shared some miles. It would pass, but for a while the quiet always bothered me.""Heat-Moon frequently wrote about change: ""On the road, where change is continuous and visible, time is not; rather it is something the rider only infers. Time is not the traveler's fourth dimension--change is.""Henry Miller: ""Our destination is never a place but rather a new way of looking at things.""""A human being is not a waxen rubbing, a lifeless imprint taken from some great stony face. Rather he is a Minuteman or a dog soldier at liberty to use the inclinations of the past as he sees fit. He is free to perceive the matrix, and, within his limits, change from it. By seeing both the futility in trying to relive the old life and the danger in trying to obliterate it, man can gain the capacity to make anew. His very form depends not on repetition but upon variation from old patterns. In response to stress, biological survival requires genetic change; it necessitates a turning away from doomed replication. And what of history? Was it different?. Etymology: educate, from the Latin educare, 'lead out.'""...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Dec 19, 2008","Nov 30, 2008",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1679010.Blue_Highways

Usually, I realize how unprepared I was for the book and how little I gI enjoy going back and reading books that I was forced to read in high school. Usually, I realize how unprepared I was for the book and how little I got out of it (or understood of it). Orwell’s 1984 comes to mind. My first read of The Great Gatsby (some ten-plus years ago) was completely forgettable. I know I read it (one of the few books, perhaps, that I actually finished at the time), but I couldn’t remember a thing - I was clearly unmoved. Upon rereading it, I was struck by the occasionally (and only occasionally) beautiful language, by its subtlety (see the quote below), and most importantly by the wonderfully complex love triangle, or pentagon I should say, whose destruction is really the end-game of the book (it’s a wonder I couldn’t remember any of this stuff).He took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them one by one before us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in many-colored disarray. While we admired he brought more and the soft rich heap mounted higher - shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and apple green and lavender and faint orange with monograms of Indian blue. Suddenly with a strained sound Daisy bent her head into the shirts and began to cry stormily.  “They’re such beautiful shirts,” she sobbed, her voice muffled in the thick folds. “It makes me sad because I’ve never seen such - such beautiful shirts before.” What a beautiful and strange and profound expression of love by Gatsby, and its sorrowful rejection by Daisy. What high school kid will see more than piled shirts and an unwarranted cry?Upon rereading Gatsby, I was also struck by how small the book seemed. Short books do not always feel short, but this one did. I also didn’t think Gatsby (of all characters!) was particularly well-drawn. Besides his “old sport” utterings and his obvious opulence, who is he? He was a vague character in my mind when I first read the book, and he remains a vague character.The Great Gatsby is a good book, but I think the high-schooler in me was correct in questioning its greatness....more",Notes are private!,0,0,2,not setnot set,"May 27, 2009not set","Nov 24, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4671.The_Great_Gatsby
