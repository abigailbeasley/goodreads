All the way to safety.” This is Chiara aka Claire’s realization after months of “I had to rise up, ride this wave on its crest, all the way to shore. All the way to safety.” This is Chiara aka Claire’s realization after months of struggling to motivate her sister Ondina to miraculously break free of the “locked-in syndrome” brought on by an aneurism and return to the world. The metaphor relates to Claire’s love of surfing and is also a central philosophical dilemma beautifully threaded throughout this immensely engaging and at times overwhelming story. Can a “warrior” like Claire, who thrives on tackling life’s challenges and whose only fear is losing her beloved sister, reach into herself deeply enough to find the strength to let her go? Would this be the ultimate failure or something else entirely?We get to know both sisters intimately, their past exploits and tangled relationships with family and loved ones, so that in spite of their inability to reach across the barrier of Ondina’s comatose state their relationship shines brightly, their love for each other illuminating every page. Claire’s fierceness is echoed by the protagonist of her novels, a detective appropriately named Nails. Her volatile nature both contrasts and complements Ondina’s meditative artistry. The sisters are equally committed to creative expression as a way of life, which makes this work of women’s fiction especially compelling.The vivid descriptions of both Italy and California, as Claire travels back and forth on her odyssey to help her sister heal, add a 3-dimensional colorful quality to the writing that serves to balance the depressing and at times terrifying realism of the depiction of Ondina’s medical treatment and mistreatment. Just as Claire refuses to turn away from witnessing her sister’s suffering, the reader who fully connects with this book may find reserves of empathy previously unknown….as well as the rewards that follow.Highly recommended....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Apr 06, 2024","Apr 09, 2024","Apr 09, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/61252206-california-sister

It is the first book in the series I have read and I will definitely backtrack to Book I and continue reading. I love learning about history while being kept on the edge of my seat!Muhammad Amalfi is now the Chief Commissioner of the Hinterlands, appointed by the all-feared Dey of Algiers. He has acquired a sophisticated view of the politics of that country, which is under Turkish rule in the 1790’s and at a point in its history where piracy and respectable trade are of equal importance to its economy. In some ways Amalfi is still an Italian outsider – but he has also converted to Islam and adopted many local customs as his own. He is a friend of one of the most notorious corsair that the Mediterranean has ever known, and that’s what draws him into the main conflict of the book – his quest to rescue two hunted children before they can be sacrificed on the altar of honor.Caught up in murder and intrigue, Muhammad takes action, but he also reflects on the nature of honor and many other philosophical questions that add depth to is character and appealed to this reader.

Lewis’s new series of police procedurals set in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. As capable as any man on the department, if not more so, Lydia faces the challenge of proving herself to her new boss because of her recent transfer as well as her gender. This situation motivates her to work even harder at solving a murder that at first looks like an accidental death.The rural/suburban setting is rich with characters from many walks of life and Lewis does an excellent job developing them, from the neighbor who calls the police when she notices Barnwell’s boyfriend – a Black detective who uses his personal car when visiting her – to a trio of female suspects trying to hold on to their jobs as the police close in on them.The story is told from dual perspectives – Barnwell’s as she works the case, and from the POV of the suspects, who are well drawn and believable. This increases the suspense, since the reader often becomes privy to information before Barnwell does. Altogether a well-written, immersive mystery with a surprise ending set up by clues that make it totally believable.Readers who enjoy procedurals grounded in solid research combined with compelling characters will enjoy this book....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Mar 25, 2024",Apr 2024,"Mar 18, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/209635583-the-dead-of-winter

Le does not have her own brand of tissues, she should think about it. I felt so many emotions reading this second book in Snow trilogy, as I laughed and cried my way through Snow in Seattle. With vivid detail and unfailing humor and empathy, Le takes us along as her mother Snow continues the journey she began as one of the ‘boat people’ who escaped Vietnam with great difficulty after the fall of Saigon. We witness her arrival in the United States with her rebellious nephew and her daughter Dolly, who finally undergoes a successful heart operation after so many years of struggle and hardship. The book is written in first person, allowing Snow to share her many hilarious encounters with English idioms (“picking the short straw,” “a sight for sore eyes,“just to name a few) as she masters the language. Snow, in real life, is the author’s mother, and this book is a beautifully written and heartfelt tribute to a brave, resolute, and loving parent.A highlight in the book for me is Snow’s reunion and friendship with Skyler, a US soldier she first met in Vietnam, where together they witnessed the death of Sam, the American soldier Snow was engaged to marry. Sky’s episodes of PSTD are heartbreaking and through his attempts to readjust to civilian life we relive the hell that draftees who were sent to Vietnam went through when they returned home to hostility and indifference to the trauma they brought back with them. Sky’s friendship with Snow, and his supportive parents, bring him some healing and readers will root for him all the way.Since I live in Seattle, I enjoyed all the scenes set in nearby Kent – the picture Le draws of American suburban life, right down to trips to the mall, friendships formed with neighbors, and a hilarious ugly sweater party, is right on the money.Snow in Seattle is a must read for anyone who wants to see through the eyes of a remarkably resilient and compassionate woman who not only adjusts and eventually succeeds in her new life but also preserves the essence of her Vietnamese way of life while letting go of her painful past.

Her strong Jewish roots and her lively interactions with her female Muslim friends—Fatima, Xemci and Azizah—are nourished by their shared love for good food, music, and poetry. In fact, one of the wonderful aspects of this book is how often the characters, especially Saritia, burst into song and exchange verse. Edith Scott Saavedra has captured a time when human communication was more direct in its delivery—and deeper. In our age of social media, Zoom, and canned entertainment, a visit to Sarita’s world is quite the tonic!The plot gains excitement as Sarita, pursued by the Inquisition after escaping imprisonment in a monastery, disguises herself and travels the back roads with her Muslim friends toward the port of Valencia, where many families of Jewish origin are setting sail aboard outbound ships. By this time we know these characters well and are sad to bid them goodbye. My hope is that readers will connect with this inspirational story with the power to sustain us, since we, too, are living in challenging times.Highly recommended....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Dec 10, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/41176289-the-lamps-of-albarracin

It also offers sage, grounded, and often humorous advice to anyone facing the universal, coming-of-age challenges described therein.I found many useful takeaways, both as a parent and someone who values personal growth at any age. The section that tackles the Yeah But Monster—you know, the one who appears when we dare to want something really difficult to achieve—is especially topical. Thinking about the future is a bit scary these days but Van’t Land tells us: “Let yourself want it. Let yourself feel the way it burns in your belly. Let it be uncomfortable. The thing you want is sacred. It’s calling to you. You don’t have to know why—in fact most of the time you CAN’T KNOW why.” This is only one example of how she urges young people to embrace the unknown and reach beyond their comfort zone. Whether you’re fourteen or forty, that’s great advice.There ‘s a wonderful chapter on friendship—on how to differentiate between friends who sparkle and may briefly light up your life, and those that glow with a longer lasting warmth. I wish that I’d read this book when I was younger. I might have noticed some of the red flags, the obstacles to forming truly reciprocal relationships, that the author points out. Van’t Land freely shares her choices as a parent, not always popular with other adults around her, and I found this aspect of the book to be especially refreshing.Highly recommended....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Nov 20, 2021","Nov 20, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/59464451-talk-back-to-me

But that doesn’t give our passion for finding our roots less value. On the contrary, the empathy felt by Rachel, the protagonist of “The Lines Between Us,” grows stronger with each page she reads in the diaries and mysterious papers she finds after her mother Helen’s death.Rachel’s quest - sparked by Helen’s regretful words — is a meaningful, albeit often painful journey. As she reads the words penned by her female ancestors, she begins to understand their limited choices and precarious status as women in a fiercely patriarchal society. A chain of dramatic events is set in motion in 17th century Spain, as a husband fails to protect his wife from the horrors of the Inquisition and permits his distorted sense of honor to threaten the life of his own daughter. The daughter flees to New Spain and Rachel continues to reconstruct her family tree. Each generation brings more surprises and beautifully constructed characterizations of women whose words express not only their personal struggles but their views of the wider world as well. For example, I was delighted to find a budding friendship between one of Rachel’s ancestor’s who enters a convents and corresponds with the the extraordinary Mexican philosopher and poet, Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz. I recommend this book to lovers of historical fiction as well as anyone who is curious about their own ancestry and in need of inspiration to conduct their own search. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Sep 16, 2021","Oct 03, 2021","Sep 16, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/54339830-the-lines-between-us

Snow must exchange an idyllic childhood, nurtured by the sensual beauty of a tropical paradise where people live close to nature and neighbors trust one another, for a loveless but pragmatic marriage and a country at war with itself. When Saigon falls to the communists, she must find a way to provide medical care for her fragile baby and to help feed a large family of siblings. She masters the art of black-marketeering and tries to save money to escape to America. After several thwarted attempts, she finally boards a fishing trawler with more than 40 other escapees.

As Joe explains to his grandson, “When we start out in life, Franco, the world is so full of promise! We are certain of who we are and what we are about, and that nothing can stop us from doing what we were put on this earth to do—nothing, that is, except hunger, and we soon learn that having high ideals doesn’t put food on the table.” Joe’s pragmatism is coupled with a deep love for his grandson Franco, who graduates from Harvard Law School and who Joe hopes will someday take over the legitimate business he has worked so hard to build. When one of their young family members gets into trouble, Joe sends Franco to England on an important errand - to unearth enough damaging information about the prosecutor to upend the case in the boy’s favor.The prosecutor is Archie Bingham, whose provenance could not be more different than Frankie’s. Born into a highly respectable English family, the son of a powerful legal eagle who prizes his reputation above all else, Archie is made to feel inadequate—to the point where no amount of power, lustful pleasure, or money can restore his self-esteem. As he indulges the dark side of himself, Archie becomes the villain we ‘love to hate.’ Yet in Rita Baker’s capable hands, he is a fully realized human being about whom we can say, “There but for the grace of God go I.”Franco and Archie are diametrically opposite in nature - but they both feel deeply—it is the beauty of this book that we can relate to both of them and feel their pain and joy equally. Baker spares no details in giving us a a deep look into the psyche of each man—the why as well as the wherefore—making Of Breeding and Birth both a pleasure to read and a heart-expanding experience. The scenes set in London and in Sicily are especially well-drawn and rich with description.Highly Recommended....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Apr 07, 2021","Apr 13, 2021","Apr 13, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/44697266-of-breeding-and-birth

I found this journey into the world of imperial power, intrigues and hidden alliance to be a fascinating and enjoyable read.Stephan Roman’s writing flows quite naturally and there are moments of wit and humor that let us relax a bit amidst the intensity....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Mar 15, 2021","Apr 28, 2021","Apr 12, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50976862-isle-and-empires

Readers of DEVIL BY THE TAIL are as likely to encounter a herd of hogs on their way to the stockyards trotting briskly down the middle of the street as we are to meet a wildly diverse and colorful bunch of human characters from all walks of society. One of my favorites is Gentle Annie, who “took a horsewhip to her faithless lover, Cap Hyman, and flogged him through the streets, a ferocious show of love that persuaded him to ask her hand in marriage.”Garnick and Paschal is a detective agency with a twist. One of the partners—Quinn Sinclair—has disguised herself as Mrs. Paschal to conceal her identity as a single woman with an Irish background—a deception that is essential to her professional advancement in the 1860’s. Quinn and Garnick have a lot in common: Her independence was hard won after years of living as a widow under the thumb of her mother-in-law after her husband died, and Garnick knows what it’s like to be imprisoned, having spent two years soldiering in the Confederate Army and another two as a prisoner of war in a disease-infested camp. They also share a sense of humor rooted in having survived many difficult circumstances and readers will enjoy watching their rapport grow stronger as their investigations throw even more violent obstacles in their shared path. All this leads to a budding romance about which I will say no more in this “spoiler-free” .DEVIL BY THE TAIL begins with the partners taking on an assignment to help an unlikable client clear his name of a murder, a case that quickly intersects with an investigation for a dodgy lawyer who is defending “the girl who burned down the Kadinger place and killed him and his daughter.” If convicted, the accused woman “would be hooded, noosed, and dropped from the scaffold with the public and an avid cadre of newspaper reporters looking on.” There is a lot at stake in this book, with plenty of suspenseful twists and turns that mystery lovers will enjoy – plus a satisfying and unexpected ending. An enjoyable read with well-developed characters and tons of atmosphere pulled straight from the 19th century.

The novel begins during the“Betrayed” is an apt title for this gripping story that dives headlong into a morass of medical malpractice and deception. The novel begins during the period known as The Emergency, a 21-month period from 1975 to 1977 when a form of totalitarianism was imposed on India by Indira Gandhi. During this time, mass sterilization of women became the norm and surgeons were also required by the government to perform a quota of vasectomies. After this oppressive period ended, the privatization of medicine was finally allowed. However, as exemplified by this cautionary tale, lack of regulation allowed the pendulum to swing too far.Through the eyes of Anita, a sensitive artist who marries Amit Biswas, an ambitious surgeon who wants to start his own private hospital, we get a first hand view of the deadly progress of corruption. Slowly but surely the mantra of profit-at-any-cost begins to drive every aspect of Amit’s enterprise. Chadha’s research is impressive as she spares no details in describing all the crooked ways practiced by those who betray their oath to do no harm. Their crimes extend outside India, having international repercussions that are invisible until the book’s surprising and satisfying denouement. A concurrent story follows a young widow, Mohini, who flees the threatening advances of her lustful brothers-in-law and works her way towards a successful career. Chadha skillfully weaves the two story-threads together, with both women taking different routes - one suffering from being subservient to her husband and giving up her art for the sake of his success and the other taking a more self-empowered route with its own challenges. For this reader, the most meaningful moments were those that came from Anita and Mohini’s travails and successes. For me, their perseverance also symbolized the struggle of a young nation to find its way to asserting its freedom not only from colonialism but from greed itself. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and recommend it to those who enjoy novels of suspense with strong political and social overtones....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Feb 24, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/36479843-betrayed---tale-of-a-rogue-surgeon

It is a technique that works especially well when the larger than life events characteristic of magical realism begin to transpire. Like Cervantes and Borges before him, Trujillo knows how to make it easy for us to suspend disbelief. It is no surprise that the protagonist, an itinerant photographer named Baudolino “Fotolino” Pinto, transports his equipment on a mule called Ramona. The story begins amidst the violent political crisis that gripped the city of Bogata in 1948 after the assassination of Jorge Eliecer Gaitán. Through Fotolino’s horrified eyes we see his innocent friend Roa lynched by a mob of Gaitan’s followers, a mistake deftly engineered by Death himself. These events will shape Colombian history for decades and also foreshadow what happens as Fotolino goes on to seek his fortune. Although his adventures may seem bizarre at times, everything that happens also has the feel of being entirely pre-destined and believable. I loved this dichotomy and it kept me engaged from start to finish.Lino (as he is known to his family and friends) stumbles onto his life’s work when he decides to bring Robertico, the town priest’s beloved vulture who attends all the church festivities, back to life in a photograph. Soon everyone in the town of Santuario, wants to have pictures taken with their recently deceased relatives - their eyes glued open to give them the appearance of life. Eventually Lino creates a gallery of photos of the living that will one day be exhibited on the altar of the dead. What better job for a photographer than to document not only the lives, but the deaths of the townspeople he sees everyday? Lino knows he is playing with Death but he is supporting his family, who all help him with his thriving business. What could possibly go wrong? I hope I have not said too much and urge you to read this marvelous work of humorous, satirical fiction, beautifully descriptive and tinged with social commentary.Highly Recommended....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jan 15, 2021","Feb 07, 2021","Jan 15, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/56677715-never-play-with-death

After reading James White’s novel, I came away with a different view altogether – one that will stay with me for a long time. Paradise is complicated but no less to be valued. White captures the ambience of the pre-World-War-II American West beautifully, as the main protagonist of Borders in Paradise—Charles “Chassy” Gaines—escapes the suffocation of an early disastrous marriage by joining the US Border Patrol. We follow Charles as he exchanges the rundown bungalow he shares with his mother and siblings in West Hollywood for the hardscrabble, border town of Douglas Arizona and a stint on nearby Slaughters Ranch. The author avoids the cliches often associated with these settings by developing his characters with clear-eyed realism. Another family member who comes to the fore as the book progresses is Charles’ enigmatic older brother, Juno, who narrates some of the book in first person and whose coming-of-age turns out to be more compelling and interesting than I expected. As a reader who enjoys books that carry me into the hearts and minds of people who see the world from their own unique perspective, I very much enjoyed this book and recommend it....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,not set,"Jan 01, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/43632892-borders-in-paradise

In Only in Darkness can You See the Stars, Santosh Bakaya gives us a definitive biography that follows his life as he lived it, one revelation at a time, solidly placed in the context of the unstoppable Civil Rights movement he launched and led during his short life.I have often wondered how Martin Luther King, Jr. found the strength to almost single-handedly, raise the consciousness of an entire nation. As Bakaya tells us, King did not start out to be a preacher. I was fascinated by the intellectual, emotional and spiritual journey he undertook during his formative years. He read Marx, whose philosophy attracted him but not his materialism, Thoreau from whom he gleaned the essence of what civil disobedience can accomplish, and many others political scientists and philosophers—before settling on Mahatma Gandhi as his model. On his visit to India in 1959, he told reporters who gathered at the airport: “to other countries I may go as a tourist, but to India I come as a pilgrim.” He came home fully resolved to “train our youth and adult leaders in the techniques of social change through non-violent resistance.”The book lives up to its title as Bakaya unflinchingly portrays the brutality of the backlash against the demonstrators, Freedom Riders and practitioners of passive resistance who stood up for their rights as Americans under the leadership of King and scores of other leaders in the American South. Compelling photographs support her documentation of the violent, tumultuous days that tested the resolve of every person who stood in solidarity against racism and oppression. From shots of Bull Connor’s dogs and fire hoses attacking peaceful protestors to pictures of the famous March on Washington, these images bring home the author’s powerfully descriptive words. Be prepared to occupy a ring-side seat and witness the events that forced the American government to finally act to dismantle the Jim Crow laws and provide a legal basis for the continuing struggle for racial and economic equality.Dr. Bakaya lives in Jaipur and her 2015 biography of Mahatma Gandhi was very well-received. In ""The Ballad of Bapu""—written in rhyming couplets that mesmerize the reader—she sets out and succeeds in reclaiming the truth of Gandhi’s life at a time when a disinformation campaign in India is still working to discredit him. As she states in the preface to Only in Darkness can You See the Stars, “...after the Mumbai 26/11 terrorist attack… I sat alone in my classroom…with Martin Luther King Jr.’s words persistently ringing in my ears –‘We still have a choice today, nonviolent co-existence or violent co-annihilation.’” Bakaya’s intent in writing about Martin Luther King, Jr. was to bring understanding and appreciation of a major historical figure to a generation of young Indians familiar with him in name only. As it turns out, the book also bring many new insights to American readers and others worldwide—just as King himself became an international leader when he spoke out against the Vietnam War.

Add a rambling old house in the Indian Hills with hidden rooms hinting at hidden branches in the family tree, and I was hooked.There are many mysteries here from the start. Why does Hannah, the youngest daughter and narrator, have such terrible nightmares about the Historian? And how can her Iranian mother, the Magician, be so strong and loving with her children yet helpless in the face of her Anglo Indian husband’s violent temper and domineering behavior? These are questions that are answered at a leisurely pace that I found refreshing amidst the plethora of 21st century books written by authors who cater to what they assume to be their readers’ truncated attention spans. Not so, Rashida Murphy. Her writing is meant to be savored. Still, there are plenty of heart-stopping moments and lots of situationally-driven suspense in The Historian’s Daughter.Murphy is a non-linear storyteller and this allows her to sweep us backwards and forwards in time, using Hannah as our lynchpin. Hannah has a love/hate relationship with both the cultures that claim her. The Historian’s library is a refuge while at the same time his presence is a menace, with his terrible English bigotry against all things Indian and impotent anger at having no place in society. The affectionate Magician’s wonderful teas and healing aromatic dishes nourish Hannah while at the same time there is an unexplained gulf between them. When the Magician disappears, we follow Hannah to Australia, and then to Iran, as she struggles to learn the truth about her origins and to open her heart to love in spite of all she has endured. Rich with telling details that provide texture both visually and emotionally, this fine book is one that deserves to grace many home libraries. Such as the Historian’s library, where Hannah finds books about the English ‘Conquistadors’ - a word she takes to mean ‘come kiss the doors,’ a ritual she performs every time she enters. As soon as I learned this about her I decided I could follow her anywhere.

From alternating points of view, we follow Ernesto Ruiz, who leaves the comfort of his San Diego home to travel south in search of his birth family and we accompany Rosa Epayuma, a Huaorani from the Amazonian region of Ecuador, on her excruciatingly difficult journey north to join her mother in the US. Along the way, we experience the hard-edged realities that immigrants must deal with and witness the devastation caused by the ruthless exploitation of a dazzlingly beautiful ecosystem. This is an eye-opener for anyone who has never, like Rosa, voyaged in hold of a fishing boat packed with desperate people or, like Ernesto, chosen to “enter the world of the Huaorani like a Greek hero descending into the Underworld.”The two main characters are well drawn. Ernesto is at first the more timid but he grows into his own during his nigh impossible quest to reconnect with his roots. As Wirkala puts it, “...something extraordinary obliges him to pursue it, something that defies logic. He feels like he’s reaching his hand into the darkness hoping someone will take it.”Rosa has a strong kinship with the animal kingdom and there is a mythological quality to this fierce girl’s relationships with the creatures she tries to protect and who in turn protect her. Bruised, battered but unbowed, she invokes “an imaginary magician to help her cross the Rio Grande on invisible wings” before taking matters into her own hands. And it is not only the Mexican/US border that Rosa is determined to cross. In the author’s words, “It is the border dividing the Stone Age world of the Amazonian natives from a modern world advancing brutally, invincibly, over them.”Wirkala’s descriptions of village life in Guatemala and in Ecuador are exquisite and carry us deeper into the lives of those who have achieved a closeness to nature than we in the so-called civilized world have irreparably lost. That the Huaorani way of life is close to extinction and so many have been poisoned and died from oil industry pollution is the tragedy at the center of this book. The resilience and strength of Rosa and Ernesto, who represent the unwritten future, provide the hope we need. Their sweet meeting in Guatemala has far reaching consequences that this reader will not spoil by revealing here.On Ernesto’s way to interview a family he hopes will turn out to be his own, he and his guide “follow a path that cuts through the red earth, and soon take a narrow trail lined with the foliage of tall corn plants. Silky beards, red and orange, hang from the ears, signaling that it’s harvest time.” I felt a strong urge to touch these silky beards and walk on the red earth beside Ernesto. Fiction blended with reality. That is the true power of storytelling, a power that this eloquent writer uses well.Wirkala never turns her gaze away from harsh realities and Ernesto makes hugely disconcerting discoveries about his adoptive father’s role in destroying Rosa’s homeland. In spite of this, it occurs to Ernesto that “for every distortion and disharmony and degradation that occurs somewhere in the world, there must be, somewhere else, a harmonious and positive force to restore the lost balance, so the world does not end.” The book itself embodies this philosophy and for that reason is a joy to read.

In my case it was an elderly Brit who spent a lifetime trying to achieve “just intonation” by tuning the vibrations of oddly shaped metal instruments. My friend would have found a kindred spirit in Luther Van der Loon—the narrator and protagonist of Carol LaHine’s darkly funny book about a professor of early music who worships the “perfect Pythagorean intervals” and resents their corruption by the modern, equally tempered 12 tone scale. With the same passion that Luther rejects equal-temperament, he rejects the idea that his beloved mother choking on a wonton was a senseless accident for which no one can be held accountable. To the dismay of Celia, his therapist girlfriend, he wakes frequently in the middle of the night, waving his fist and cursing the legion of Chinese deliverymen in New York City. Behind her back, he initiates a law suit against the ironically named Seventh Happiness restaurant, even as he wallows in guilt at his inability to save his mother by performing the Heimlich maneuver. His constant flashbacks to the scene of her death, recurring nightmares, and frequent panic attacks are all symptoms of PTSD. It is difficult to tell what Luther grieves for most - the loss of his mother or the loss of what he sees as the pinnacle of perfection in music. In many ways the book resembles a musical composition, with the two motifs being the death of his mother, who he fails to save, and his equally hopeless efforts to resuscitate a dying form of music.Celia’s playbook of standard grief counseling techniques is no match for Luther’s determination to intellectualize his grief. He is unattractive physically and has a morbid streak, so one of the book’s initial mysteries is what she sees in him that keeps her by his side. Gradually we find that he is not entirely unlovable, nor is he illogical. When he opines that “There are heavenly, sonorous tones, auspicious ratios, that have been eliminated in the interest of uniformity,” I found myself taking his side, much as I love the sound of jazz piano. Seeing the world through the lens of his devotion to music also makes him endearing at times - as when he describes a lawyer as having “giant bearish hands, stubby fingers and a meager finger span — entirely inappropriate for playing a sensitive keyboard or string instrument.”This existentialist novel lives up to its title in unpredictable and often delightful ways. Is there an order to the universe that was violated when instead of #25 - beef and broccoli — Luther’s mom changed her choice to #29 , General Tso’s Chicken thereby consuming the fatal wonton? Are the divine ratios proof positive of the existence of a Superior Being and if so why did churches let their organ pipes be reconfigured in conformity with the equal temperament?

I use that adjective because to envision a future for a nation and its people takes courage. And it is Madsen’s vision that is the foundation for the dramatic story he has chosen to tell. Isaac Breda is the modern protagonist of the novel and a descendent of Toussaint Louverture, the famous Haitian revolutionary and humanist who led the battle for his country’s freedom from France during Napoleon’s rule. We follow both of these men in alternating stories until the novel settles into the present and moves into what I found myself fervently hoping will be its future. A strong theme of courage in the face of overwhelming odds runs though this book, and the slogan “Nou pa pè!” - We are not afraid!” resounds from the pages.Madsen has wonderful powers off description. Both the Haitian and New York settings come alive in this book and provide a strong sense of place. Combine that with the author’s sense of humor, his gift for painting heroes and villains equally well, and his inclusion of a love story of epic proportions and you get a book that is genuinely moving (in spite of a few pages that seem to belong in a philosophical treatise).I now have a much better grasp of Haitian history and the tragedy of how, after achieving independence, Haiti has remain colonized on many levels and unable to make the progress that Toussaint dreamed about. What the book brings is a sense of possibilities, an affirmation that with wise and compassionate leadership Haiti could experience lasting change for the better.I was touched and surprised by the ending.Highly recommended for anyone with a true interest in Haitian history and culture, as well as vivid characters who embody the struggle for justice and economic well-being that continues to this day....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Aug 27, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/41039145-the-sons-and-daughters-of-toussaint

He makes a fateful decision to pull off the road at the “Ancient Mound 7 Miles” sign, pitch his tent at the top of the Mound to spend the night.

In the hands of a gifted writer such as Donna Stramella, this truism can turn into a compelling story. In “Coffee Killed My Mother,” 17-year-old Anna Lee watches her eccentric mother Jacqueline through a sardonic lens, shifting between hostility and grudging admiration as she is dragged along on a coffee-tasting road trip. Aside from being on the constant lookout for caffein infusions to replace her craving for alcohol, the brightly clad Jacqueline has family secrets to dole out along the way and another, more mysterious agenda that becomes clear only when the book ends.This seemingly mis-matched pair stops at numerous small towns as well as ocean-resorts on their frequently-detoured-from-route down the East Coast from New Jersey to Florida. Anna Lee starts a journal devoted to chronicling 100 Reasons Why My Mother is Crazy. But it is really her own foibles that reveal the teenager’s inner life. She uses her considerable powers of observation to distance herself from others, including her ex-alcoholic mother who has caused her pain in the past and seems bent on making amends. Just as Jacqueline craves coffee to quell anxiety, Anna Lee feels a strong need to count things when she feels nervous, be it cars, road signs or, in one instance, two condoms, five empty liquor bottles, and one pair of women’s underwear. I found myself wondering early on if this compulsion would someday combine with her knack for writing descriptions to make Anna Lee a writer, eventually following in her journalist mother’s footsteps. The mother daughter relationship is brilliantly rendered, full of humor and pathos in equal measure and subtlety evolving towards an unknown destination in a way that builds suspense and makes the physical journey the perfect metaphor for the emotional one. Anna Lee’s coming of age is the kind that could happen to any one of us at any time.

Both English and French are spoken in Faby’s home and her Maman (mother) and Maman Aurore (grandmother) run their household with the same pointed efficiency as Maman Aurore’s speedy knitting needles.

The author deftly brings to life the song and dance acts that Faby enjoys every night, the grueling train rides and increasingly seedy hotels, and regales us with tall stories swapped by performers over mid-night snacks after the show. And when Faby finally returns home to give birth, we see a different world through her eyes than the one she left.

Highly recommended for adults and young adults alike....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Aug 21, 2020","Aug 29, 2020","Aug 21, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/27135523-the-encounter

Enter Bhaswati Ghosh, who vividly portrays life within the Gariahata Refugee Camp in all its complexity. Her attention to detail sets the mood and readers will savor descriptions such as, “Water gathered in stray pieces of junk littered on the ground: torn clothes, old newspapers with blotting ink splattering on the ground, a perforated aluminum plate that sang stridently as the rain hit its base.”There are two protagonists in Victory Colony, 1950: Amala—who arrives by train in Calcutta with her little brother Kartik, after fleeing the violence in her village in East Pakistan and Manas Dutta—a book-lover and volunteer at the camp who comes from an upper class family. Both of them are well drawn and the evolution of their relationship as well as their individual growth are central to the book. As the story begins, Amala loses Kartik in the crowded railway station and desperately searches for him. Manas finds her there and with great difficulty persuades her to enter the van going to the camp. Having adjusted to camp life, Amala is recruited by Manas to help other women, in spite of her needing as much, if not more support as those she is expected to comfort. This theme of how we can lift ourselves up by helping others runs through the book and spoke to my heart. Amala continues her search for Kartik and as she bonds with other women in the camp they face many other conflicts and obstacles. There is also a love story that makes the book even more of a page-turner. Manas is a voracious reader and at one point he purchases Ivan Turgenev’s A Sportsman’s Sketches from a bookseller on College Street. He reflects in his diary on the similarities between the downtrodden people Turgenev writes about and the people in the camp where he works. He asks himself, “Who is going to write their stories when no one even cares whether they exist or not?” This is a question that I can hear author Bhaswati Ghosh asking herself. Her answer is a resounding “I will.” She has done a magnificent job....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Aug 19, 2020","Sep 09, 2020","Aug 19, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/55020776-victory-colony-1950

In this case, actual bombs are set to go off and the protagonist is tasked with saving thousands of live. To survive physically and emotionally while completing his mission, newly-recruited spy Michael Dolan must first form crucial, inter-dependent relationships that are based on trust that is not always earned. To compound things, Dolan’s worst enemy may be his obsession with keeping his mind detached, his emotions boxed in, and his heart protected from his painful past. Dolan’s strengths, which are tested to the limit, are his immense resourcefulness and his unwillingness to blindly obey orders. And then—surprisingly enough—there is his growing capacity to love.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. John Casey’s unrelenting realism and technical expertise take the reader behind the scenes in a way that few spy thrillers do. At times Michael Dolan reminded me of George Smiley in John le Carré’s “The Spy Who Came in from the Cold.”This book is the first in a trilogy and I look forward to seeing more of Dolan as he continues to struggle with himself and those he works with to “do good things....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,Aug 2020,"Aug 09, 2020","Aug 09, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/52845063-devolution

Both EngFaby Gauthier, the protagonist of Telling Sonny, grows up in a small town in Vermont in the 1920’s, a few miles south of the Canadian border. Both English and French are spoken in Faby’s home and her Maman (mother) and Maman Aurore (grandmother) run their household with the same pointed efficiency as Maman Aurore’s speedy knitting needles. For Faby, recently graduated from high school and at loose ends, predictability equals boredom and it’s no surprise that she falls for a Vaudevillian dancer named Slim White when his show comes to town. What is surprising is that when Slim ( whose real name is Louis Kittel) learns that Faby is pregnant, he returns to marry her and takes her on tour with him shortly thereafter. Thus begins a beautifully written and atmospheric tale in which the dreamy-eyed, optimistic Faby continues her love affair with Vaudeville even as her disillusionment with Slim’s cavalier attitude and mysterious disappearances grows with each passing day on the road.In some books, the journey is what captivates the reader and for me this was the case. The author deftly brings to life the song and dance acts that Faby enjoys every night, the grueling train rides and increasingly seedy hotels, and regales us with tall stories swapped by performers over mid-night snacks after the show. And when Faby finally returns home to give birth, we see a different world through her eyes than the one she left. Her coming of age is painful yet tempered by a bitter-sweet revelation at the end that brought tears to my eyes. Filled with unique and well-defined characters.
