While the title tells us what the outcome will be from the start, the long approach to it builds up the portrait of of Aljaz, his family, and the tragedy he has been running from for 10 years.The book is also a love letter to the wilderness of the Franklin River area, a place of both beauty and terror. Indeed, Flanagan writes beautifully and with grief about Tasmania, especially as it was before the English colonisers came: ... my mind fills with a vision of when the English first arrived and the land was fat and full of trees and game. Had the loss begun at this time? When the English first saw plains so thickly speckled with emu and wallaby dung that it looked as if the heavens must have hailed sleek black turds upon this land, when they first saw the sea and the vast blue Derwent River rainbowed with the vapoury spouts of pods of whales and schools of dolphins swimming beneath. From that time on, each succeeding generation found something new they could quarry to survive. First the emu disappeared, then the tigers, then the many different fishes and seals and whales and their rainbows became rare, then the rivers were stilled under dams, then the trees, and then the scallops and the abalone and the crayfish became few and were in consequence no longer the food of the poor but the waste of the rich.The final 50 pages or so build up and up to a terrible climax, and then finally Aljaz is at peace.

This is a book of brief essays about the people and places he came across while travelling in China after the First World War. The attitudes of the Europeans living in China and exploiting it are predictable but nonetheless appalling. One example is the following:He had been in China for thirty years, and he prided himself on not speaking a word of Chinese. He never went into the Chinese city. His compradore* was Chinese, and some of the clerks, his boys** of course, and the chair coolies; but they were the only Chinese he had anything to do with, and quite enough too.""I hate the country, I hate the people,"" he said. ""As soon as I've saved enough money I mean to clear out.""* A compradore is a person who acts as an agent for foreign organisations engaged in investment, trade, or economic or political exploitation. (from Wikipedia)**The 'boys' were servants.His descriptions are perfect.

They are built of dried mud and so dilapidated that you feel a breath of wind will lay them flat upon the dusty earth from which they have been made.

The prose seemed rather pedestrian, which surprised me very much given that Judith Wright was one of our most eminent poets. I also disliked the partly fictional style, almost turning the story of her ancestors into a novel by including various thoughts and feelings which have to be Wright's inventions, even though she had access to diaries and letters of the people of whom she writes.The book was written back in 1959 and Wright went on to be an important activist on the environment and also on the treatment of our First Nations people. It recounts the activities of the settlers including the dispossession of the people whose land they were taking over, the ringbarking of trees in order to grow the grass they wanted for their stock, without any reflection of the terrible damage being inflicted on the people and the land.Only towards the end of the book she imagines her ancestor Albert reflecting on ""this whirlwind of destruction"" and on how ""they had killed Paddy's people, driving them in hundreds over the cliffs of the tableland to die on the rocks below - for spearing cattle, for rebellion against the dominion of money and prosperity.""A little later, with Albert still musing, she writes ""To forgive oneself - that was the hardest task. Until the white men could recognise and forgive that deep and festering consciousness of guilt in themselves, they would not forgive the blacks for setting it there. The murder would go on - open or concealed - until the blacks were all gone, the whites forever crippled.""Wright gives us no indication whatsoever that she has any proof that Albert thought these things. They may be simply her hope that he did have some inkling of what was being done, and indeed continued to be done for many more years, well into the 20th century, as the frontier moved westwards.In the end, the book is about the triumph against the odds of dealing with the challenges of the country to the settlers, who without doubt lived very difficult and often heart-breaking lives of struggle to succeed.Mildly interesting, but not really recommended, especially for those who like their biographies to eschew fictional imaginings, and to look at the subject(s) with a dispassionate eye....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Oct 04, 2023","Oct 10, 2023","Oct 04, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/35154053-the-generations-of-men

The character of the ailing Jane Vevaseur is a semi-autobiographical portrayal of Julia Frankau, while her loving sister Eliza Aria is represented by the character of Ella Lovegrove. The title itself is a doubly resonant play on words – the dictum ""Work whilst ye have the light"" is quoted several times by the narrator, alluding to the fact that she (like Frank Danby) is running out of time; [and there is mention] of what the narrator refers to as ""hyoscine"", a drug known in its day as ""Twilight Sleep"".

I came to it with an open mind, interested to learn more about why a number of people believe that the actor William Shakespeare was not the author of the plays, but was a ""front man"" for the 17th Earl of Oxford, Edward de Vere.It starts off well enough, with the author choosing to refer to the actor as Shakspere (one of the many spellings of his name) and to the author as Shake-speare. This falls by the wayside by part way through the second chapter with statements such as:De Vere would pilfer a subplot from ""The Supposes"", and arguably the entire theme of the play, for ""The Taming of the Shrew"".Thereafter de Vere is almost always referred to as the author of the plays. Another example is in writing about his travels in Italy:De Vere preserved this entire journey, in reverse, in ""Two Gentlement of Verona"".After a few hundred pages of this sort of thing, I started to feel I was being bludgeoned into agreeing that Edward de Vere was the author of all of Shakespeare's plays, just because Anderson said so.There is far too much padding out of events that de Vere might have experienced if he was there at the time. There are also pages of supposition of what de Vere might have done during his year on the Continent. It is supposed he travelled to Greece because he wrote to his father-in-law, Lord Cecil, that he would ""bestow two or three months to see Constantinople and some part of Greece"" when writing about things he wanted to do.So we have him possibly setting out on a 15 day voyage that took him to Ragusa (modern day Dubrovnik), because ships from Venice commonly called in there. Then we read:Walking through this unusual city, de Vere would have been struck by the eclectic influences that defined the coastal metropolis. This usefully links in to ""Twelfth Night"", making Ragusa the setting of that play because the coast (modern day Croatia) is determined to be the coast of Illyria.If his supposed ship made it as far as Greece, de Vere did not stay there long. As proof of this, Anderson tells us that Shakespeare's plays set in Greece offer little local colour or firsthand knowledge of Greece. And if he went to Greece, he might have gone to Delphi, because this links in to ""A Winter's Tale"".That's an awful lot of supposition, especially when the only surviving records of de Vere's travels during that summer refer to a visit he made to Palermo in Sicily.After a few hundred pages of this sort of thing, I gave up, looked at the Appendices and found some rather far-fetched explanations for why a number of the great plays only saw the light of day some years after de Vere's death in 1604. (His widow was selling the London house and clearing it out, so this somehow led to the sonnets being published in 1609 and some of the plays to be performed.)This is a book for people who believe without any real proof, that Edward de Vere wrote the entire oeuvre of William Shakespeare. While there are some interesting parallels between de Vere's life and some plot lines in some of the plays, there is absolutely no proof that de Vere wrote the plays and the sonnets.After a bit of investigation, I have decided to get hold of Contested Will by James Shapiro. Hilary Mantel gave it an enthusiastic  in The Guardian when it was published, and that's enough of a recommendation for me. (Anderson dismisses it as A breezy volume that is entertaining to read, ""Contested Will"" was widely touted as a definitive rout of the non-believers.)So unless you are already sold on the idea of Edward de Vere being Shakespeare, don't bother with this book....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Sep 03, 2023","Sep 11, 2023","Sep 03, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/73159.Shakespeare_by_Another_Name

Clark puts it very well indeed in his Conclusion:Do we really need to make the case against a single guilty state, or to rank the states according to their respective share in responsibility for the outbreak of war? In one classical study from the origins literature, Paul Kennedy remarked that it is 'flaccid' to dodge the search for a culprit by blaming all or none of the belligerent states. A stiffer approach, Kennedy implies, ought not to shrink from pointing the finger. The problem with a blame-centred account is not that one may end up blaming the wrong party. It is rather that accounts structured around blame come with built-in assumptions. They tend, firstly, to presume that in conflictual interactions one protagonist must ultimately be right and the other wrong. Were the Serbs wrong to seek to unify Serbdom? Were the Austrians wrong to insist on the independence of Albania? Was one of these enterprises more wrong than the other?

Langley was the driving force in getting the excavation of Richard's grave done, with a lot of assistance from various people of course. Jones is an historian. They write alternate chapters: Langley about the search for the grave and the work done to establish that the skeleton is indeed that of Richard III, and Jones about the history and the various personalities.I quickly tired of Langley's rather breathless prose and her goosebumps in the car park because she felt she was standing above Richard's grave. The search for Richard's grave is indeed a terrific story, but it's a pity that it wasn't narrated by a more disinterested writer. I have watched the documentaries about the search, so I tended to skip Langley's chapters and read those by Jones.There were no great revelations, but I thought that Jones did a good job of explaining the complexities of the whole mess of the Wars of the Roses, and the family trees helped with keeping on top of who was who, especially as so many of the males were called Edward!The mystery of the ""Princes in the Tower"" and who was responsible for their deaths will probably never be solved, but I found Jones' arguments persuasive that Richard probably was responsible for ordering their deaths, albeit reluctantly....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"May 21, 2023","May 25, 2023","May 21, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/28363772-the-king-s-grave

He has acted as an observer for Amnesty International in some of the murkier parts of the world and over decades has tried to ensure that justice is done. In one of the cases, brought in 1985 against a bookshop called Gay's the Word, ""Operation Tiger"" was an exercise which over 18 months was concerned with the importation of ""indecent"" books.

I enjoyed this well enough, but I had hoped to enjoy it more. Every so often Brooks jerked me out of the story with something which seemed anachronistic.One example was a passing reference by the narrator, the prophet Natan, to migrating birds. Now, the ancient Greeks did have some idea of bird migration, but did the ancient tribes of the area we now call Israel, back in about 1000 BCE? Maybe they did, but it made me stop because I rather doubt it.Far more out of its time was a reference to King David's music-making: His own compositions of that time were mighty things that reflected the building of the city, constructed of solid, symmetrical sounds, perfect fifths stacked one atop the other like the confident edifices of a powerful and joyous king.Perfect fifths??? The king's compositions had leap-frogged many centuries to the 17th, when modal music gave way to the modern system of major and minor scales and the rules of harmony, of which the perfect fifth is an important part.Okay - these things don't matter in the main telling of the story, but if they jerk the reader out of the period of King David into more modern times, then that bothers me, and of course makes me wonder about other possible inaccuracies in the telling of the tale.

The first story of an incredible trek from the coast of Victoria all the way to Sydney by a group of shipwrecked men is absolutely gripping. They only did this with the help of the many Indigenous people through whose country they were passing, and it is heartbreaking to read how quickly the story was changed by people including the Governor of New South Wales, to emphasise the one bad experience the men had in order to turn this into a story of brave white men surviving the savages.As Mark McKenna says at the end of the book: For any of us to develop a truly honest and informed historical consciousness in Australia requires a double-act: to hold both the violent dispossession of Indigenous Australians and the steady emergence of a society built on equality, democracy and freedom from racial discrimination in our imagination at the same time, and to do so by hearing both the Indigenous and non-Indigenous perspectives.We need more books about our history like this one....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jul 11, 2022","Jul 25, 2022","Jul 11, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/32598400-from-the-edge

This comment about The Scapegoat made me smile:So it is certainly going to be off to a good start in America, but I am sure to have sniffs and jeers in this country, especially if old Victor [Gollancz, her publisher] does those irritating adverts about it selling a lot before it is even published, which I am sure makes critics despise me more than ever.

It is such a sad story of survival against the odds over years of brutal POW camps, only to die in the last days before the Japanese surrender. The same thing happened to my husband's uncle. The anguish of the families at home waiting for news of their men, the elation when the war ended, and then the dreadful news of the death after so many year of waiting. On top of that was the attitude of the time which basically told the bereaved just to get on with life, with no counselling in how to deal with the trauma.This isn't great literature by any means, but it is a sad and moving story. My main criticism of the book is that it did not need the comparisons with the experiences of Viktor Frankl to validate Scott's attitude and ability to cope with the situation, while helping his fellow sufferers. His innate decency, and the respect and affection in which he was held by his comrades, are more than enough. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jan 05, 2022","Jan 10, 2022","Jan 05, 2022",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/56535966-a-week-in-september

He writes clearly and engagingly, and always with compassion. He also happens to be an indigenous Australian, so he knows first hand the grief and pain of our First Nations people.I read a couple of s here in Goodreads which describe this as an angry book. I didn't feel any anger from him, but I did feel his grief and despair. One example was his description of his feelings of exclusion as he sat in the stadium for the opening ceremony of the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney:I am from a people with a heritage deeper than any on show before me that evening. We were the first seafarers. We found a home in an isolated continent cut off from the great land bridge to Africa. We are the oldest uninterrupted civilisation on earth. Yet, on this night we were nowhere. This was Australia's night under Australia's flag. The flag carried in its corner the Union Jack of Britain, an enduring symbol of our dispossession. The flag had excluded us, for so many years denying our citizenship. This was what colonisation meant and I had never felt it so deeply - I had never felt so powerless - as I did that night.A little further on in the book he writes about the ongoing effects of racism and dispossession, and how that pain and suffering became printed on my DNA. Doctors talk about epigenetic inheritance: the experiences of parents and grandparents passed directly to their offspring. Some families carry genetic illness, passed down through the generations. My people inherit the loss of our country. It has proven as incurable and potentially lethal as any cancer.Finally, this brought me close to tears:Racism isn't killing the Australian dream. The Australian dream was founded on racism. From the first time a British flag was planted in this soil, the rules have been different for us. A convict could come in chains and die free, a rich man. But British law condemned us to a longer sentence.This book should be a set text for every school in the country, and kept there until our future generations learn how to treat our First Nations with honour and respect.

Some, like her daughter Sok Sita, had lost their wits. Some had cauterized the past with rage, and lived off anger and hatred. Some had been arrested as by a flow of burning lava in postures of bowed submission, of cowed despair: and now crawled around, bent and deformed. Some of the young fed off film-star dreams of escape. Playing ping-pong, they chattered of visas and papers that would never come. Some plotted revenge. Some went back across the border to join the resistance. Some lived for the moment, learning camp ways, learning to wheedle and exploit and profit, to scavenge and trade. Even here, there were objects to sell and recycle, there were unexplained arrivals of snakeskin and pig meat and musical instruments.

Handwritten in a notebook, it is really a first draft of the first two books of a planned five part work depicting life in France under occupation during the Second World War. The tragedy of Irène Némirovsky's deportation from France and her murder in Auschwitz in August 1942 meant this never came to pass. There are errors here and there in the book, which no doubt would have been corrected had she been able to complete the work. At the same time, there is a sense of the lived experience which is immediate and gripping.The descriptions in the first book of the chaos and confusion as people fled Paris with the approach of the Nazis are terrifying. The apparent peace of a village under occupation in the second book is fascinating. On the surface there were quite friendly relations between the villagers and the German soldiers living among them. At the same time there was the suspicion that despite kindness to the children and friendly overtures to the adults, ""... if tomorrow he was given the order, he'd arrest me, he'd kill me with his own hands without thinking twice? War ... yes, everyone knows what war is like. But occupation is more terrible in a way, because people get used to each other.

Set in the early 1950s, the difficulties of the post-war years in Britain add to the limited life led by a single woman whose only social contacts are with other members of her church congregation. Her closest friends are the vicar and his sister, Julian and Winifred. Her horizons are broadened when a married couple move into the flat below hers, and their lives spill over into hers.Much of the comedy comes with Mildred's wry thoughts about herself and others. At one point, Winifred says of Mildred to her brother:""You know Mildred would never do anything wrong or foolish.""I reflected a little sadly that this was only too true and hoped I did not appear too much that kind of person to others. Virtue is an excellent thing and we should all strive after it, but it can sometimes be a litle depressing.Later, out to a restaurant meal with the couple, Rocky and Helena, and Helena's anthropologist colleague Everard, she has to deal for the first time with spaghetti and had to be shown how to twist it around her fork. ""I found it very difficult to manage and it made conversation quite impossible. Perhaps long spaghetti is the kind of thing that ought to be eaten quite alone with nobody to watch one's struggles. Surely many a romance must have been nipped in the bud by sitting opposite somebody eating spaghetti?""At the end, we are left with the possibility that she may end up marrying Everard, but there is no certainty about this, because like most of the other characters in the book, he looks upon her as an ""excellent woman"" who is there only to help others, and needs nothing in return....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Oct 17, 2020","Oct 20, 2020","Oct 17, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/30333692-excellent-women

To give a taste of her writing, this is the final part of the last essay, What Animals Taught Me:Feeling the need for air, I sit on my back doorstep and see a rook, a sociable species of European crow, flying low towards my house through greying evening air. Straight away I use the trick I learned as a child, and all my difficult emotions lessen as I imagine how the press of cooling air might feel against its wings. But my deepest relief doesn’t come from imagining I can feel what the rook feels, know what the rook knows – instead, it’s slow delight in knowing I cannot. These days I take emotional solace from knowing that animals are not like me, that their lives are not about us at all. The house it’s flying over has meaning for both of us. To me it is home; to the rook? A waypoint on a journey, a collection of tiles and slopes, useful as a perch, or a thing to drop walnuts on in autumn to make them shatter and let it winkle out the flesh inside. But there is something else. As it passes overhead, the rook tilts its head to regard me briefly before flying on. And with that glance I feel a prickling in my skin that runs down my spine, my sense of place shifts, and the world is enlarged. The rook and I have shared no purpose. We noticed each other, is all. When I looked at the rook and the rook looked at me, I became a feature of its world as much as it became a feature of mine. Our separate lives coincided, and all my self-absorbed anxiety vanished in that one fugitive moment, when a bird in the sky on its way somewhere else sent a glance across the divide and stitched me back into a world where both of us have equal billing.I loved this book, and cannot recommend it too highly....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Dec 19, 2021","Dec 31, 2021","Jul 23, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/40867555-vesper-flights

He therefore formed the habit of fetching George, all unwilling, from the kitchen, carrying him upstairs with his arms tightly clasped under George's front legs, while George's furious hind legs clawed the air in vain for support. He would then push George in at the front door and shut it behind him. George, much agitated, would worm his way up the staircase and squeeze his body into each room in turn, vainly seeking some mode of exit. Then David discovered that if he opened the windows George, who was just too large to get through them, would in his frenzy paw all the smaller articles of furniture out of the window and then sit, crossly regarding his kind young benefactor, his large sullen face far larger than the window at which it appeared. The dolls's house had also at various times been used as a home for mice and silkworms, and was rapidly qualifying for demolition under a slum clearance scheme.""...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Mar 30, 2020","Apr 04, 2020","Mar 31, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17684093-wild-strawberries

I found this irritating, but maybe others found it helpful when there were several people together.The book covers only nine months, but what a tumultuous time it was from September 1535 to the summer of 1536.

""It is in smithereens now and buckled by damp, held together with a trio of rubber bands. In spite of its copious annotations and cross-references, I tend to use a newer model, though I do take the old one along from time to time, just to let it smell the Diapensia, so to speak, much as I might take an arthritic family dog for a ramble, out of kindness, and because of happy memories of adventurous times when both of us were less marked up.""Luc Sante in ""A Companion of the Prophet"" wrote about his relationship with Arthur Rimbaud. He made me laugh out loud with this:""At some point before adolescence, I had decided to become a child prodigy ...""An enjoyable collection, with an interesting Foreword: On Rereading by Anne Fadiman.

A beautifully written story, on the surface apparently insubstantial, but one that stays with me.

More after my Book Club discussion.It did remind me of passages (those involving sheep, shepherds and their dogs) of a book I read a very long time ago, ""Crump Folk Going Home"" by Constance Holme. When I got it out to have a look, I found that it is indeed set in Cumbria - what was then Westmorland - back in 1913. So of course I am now going to reread it.————In summary, I think the book is interesting in its descriptions of a particular way of life, one quite removed from my life experiences. The downside for me was Rebanks’ style, or lack of it. The writing is often pedestrian and occasionally dreadful. For example, he writes of pulling a book off the shelf “like it was a piece of junk”. Several times he uses the word disinterested when he means uninterested. A good editor should have dealt with such things.On the other hand, he has some lovely passages when he writes of the natural world. He observes the rooks in springtime as they pair up and make their nests:“They glide down from the wooded fell sides to where we feed without a single beat of their fingered wings, wheeling above us, seemingly motionless and within touching distance.”...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Aug 27, 2019","Sep 07, 2019","Aug 27, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22856150-the-shepherd-s-life

At one stage the cat, who tells us about the people he lives with and those who visit the house, thinks to himself ""What a spiteful bore he is.""

For example:""It was the sort of day when Tin Pan Alley lyric-writers suddenly realise that 'love' rhymes with 'skies above', and rush off, snorting, to turn out the song hit of a lifetime.""And this:""He seemed to be deploring the get-rich-quick spirit of the modern girl, who is not content to sit down and wait for her alimony.""By the time we reach the grand climax on the roof of our hero's apartment block, I was putty in Wodehouse's hands. At this point, George was hiding under the bed in his sleeping porch, which had become the hub of quite a lot of action:""A wave of self-pity flooded over George Finch. Why should he be so ill-used? He asked so little of Life, - merely to be allowed to lie quietly under a bed and inhale fluff: and what happened? Nothing but interruptions. Nothing but boots, boots, boots, boots, marching up and down again, as Kipling has so well put it.

For example, the wife of the first Viscount Melbourne was ""another of the Whig grandees whose attitude towards marriage did not include the concept of fidelity. (She) was reported to have told a young bride that her duty to her husband was to provide one male heir, and that after that she was free to amuse herself as she pleased. It was advice which Lady Melbourne herself had followed without a qualm throughout her marital career: her eldest son, Peniston, was certainly her husband's, but at least two of her five children, including William, the future Prime Minister, were fathered by Lord Egremont, and her other lovers included such eminent men as the Duke of Bedford, Lord Coleraine and the Prince of Wales himself."" A footnote adds that it was generally accepted that the Prince of Wales was the father of Lady Melbourne's third son, who was even christened George.The quite appalling overspending of many of the aristocrats, led of course by the Prince Regent himself, was all the worse when considering the situation of much of the populace and the harshness of the regime which led to transportation of convicts who were fortunate enough to escape hanging.

In some ways, this short book is a tour de force, consisting as it does of almost no action at all, spending several hours with a group of young men and women who are fog-bound at a London rail terminus, waiting to catch their boat train to go on holiday.At the same time, these people are so unpleasant and self-centred that it could not be said to be an enjoyable experience to spend any time with them at all. On the periphery of this group are some very odd others - the aunt of one young woman who is taken ill, a couple of nannies, and a mysterious man who inserts himself into proceedings apparently out of curiosity. In addition there are a couple of servants who are left to mind all the luggage while the spoilt young take themselves off to the railway hotel for refreshments.Green seems to play about with people's names - Miss Henderson is also referred to as Evelyn or Evelyna for example - and the young women are so similar to each other, as are the young men, that it is very easy to confuse them. I am sure that this is intentional - they are all so shallow and uninteresting that they are interchangeable with each other.I can admire Green's skill, but I didn't enjoy the book much at all.

I found this book a real slog to get through, and kept on finding other things to do rather than I managed to keep reading to the end, but only just. I found this book a real slog to get through, and kept on finding other things to do rather than pick it up again. I found the lack of chapters, and very few other breaks in the narrative quite exhausting.However, my main sticking point was the character of Florentino Arizo, the central male character. I found him utterly despicable in his attitude towards women, and when it reached the stage of his utter betrayal of trust and decency in seducing a 13 year old girl whose guardian he was supposed to be, there was no hope of his redemption. Fermina's initial rejection of him was instinctive and, in the light of his subsequent philanderings, the right decision. How she could finally be won over by him was utterly beyond me. This is not love - it is obsession and lust. He is a despicable example of masculine ego at its worst.There was love between Fermina and her husband: ""Together they had overcome the daily incomprehension, the instantaneous hatred, the reciprocal nastiness and fabulous flashes of glory in the conjugal conspiracy. It was the time when they loved each other best, without hurry or excess, when both were most conscious of and grateful for their incredible victories over adversity. Life would still present them with other mortal trials, of course, but that no longer mattered: they were on the other shore."" It was this relationship that kept me reading the book.Towards the end of the book, Florentino and Fermina are on a riverboat, and the description of the devastation done by humans to the river and its surrounding forest was a metaphor for the way in which Florentino had used and abandoned hundreds of women during his life:""The river became muddy and narrow, and instead of the tangle of colossal trees that had astonished Florentino Ariza on his first voyage, there were calcinated flatlands stripped of entire forests that had been devoured by the boilers of the riverboats, and the debris of god-forsaken villages whose streets remained flooded even in the cruelest droughts. ... Instead of the screeching of the parrots and the riotous noise of invisible monkeys, which at one time had intensified the stifling midday heat, all that was left was the vast silence of the ravaged land.""So there is powerful writing in this book, but it was not an experience I enjoyed, or that I wish to repeat....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Dec 07, 2018","Dec 15, 2018","Dec 07, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/20813509-love-in-the-time-of-cholera

This is the first book by McCarthy that I have read. I don't know if his style here is different from that of his other books. I found the simple though incredibly detailed language, with the occasional obscure word mixed in, a bit irritating at times. Here is one example:“The road ran along the flat gray coast and there were drifts of sand in the road that the winds had left there. It made for heavy going and they had to shovel their way in places with a plank they carried in the lower rack of the cart. They walked out down the beach and sat in the lee of the dunes and studied the map. They’d brought the burner with them and they heated water and made tea and sat wrapped in their blankets against the wind. Downshore the weathered timbers of an ancient ship. Gray and sandscrubbed beams, old handturned scarpbolts. The pitted iron hardware deep lilac in color, smeltered in some bloomery in Cadiz or Bristol and beaten out on a blackened anvil, good to last three hundred years against the sea. The following day they passed through the boarded ruins of a seaside resort and took the road inland through a pine wood, the long straight blacktop drifted in pineneedles, the wind in the dark trees.”So you trip over a word like ""bloomery"" and you understand roughly what it is, but either let it go, or stop to look it up. Turns out that according to Wikipedia a bloomery is ""a type of furnace once used widely for smelting iron from its oxides. The bloomery was the earliest form of smelter capable of smelting iron.

These days the best known of them is Alan Turing, but there were a handful of other equally brilliant codebreakers working there, and a great many others working tirelessly on what must have often been tedious and difficult work.While the intricacies of the work done there, and the machines created to help with the decoding work, were beyond my ability to understand in detail, the book is very well done in terms of showing how things progressed during the course of the war, and just how vital the codebreaking was in terms of helping to shorten the conflict. It is estimated that without their work, it could have taken up to three more years to reach the end of the war, with a great many more lives lost.Michael Smith has drawn together a great deal of first hand descriptions of people and events, and also gives a good overview of the main events of the war in Europe and to a lesser extent in Africa. His coverage of the war with Japan is much briefer, although the Japanese codes were also being broken at Bletchley Park.Recommended to those with an interest in this aspect of the Second World War....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Sep 06, 2018","Sep 11, 2018","Sep 07, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/25346598-the-secrets-of-station-x

I now give this book no stars at all, but I'm told it is advisable to show one because of the way people filter s. It is all taken from the work of others, apart from the fulsome reporting on Bacon's personal hero, Joseph Barss, who spent all of about three days helping as a first aider after the explosion. If you want to read a good book about the explosion, get ""Shattered City"" by Janet Kitz. All the interesting parts concerning the people of Halifax and the explosion in Bacon's book were taken from that by Kitz, who did all the research and interviews with survivors, and deserves the kudos.If you want tabloid journalism and a cut-and-paste job done for the centenary of the tragedy, by all means read the Bacon. ----------------------------------------------- Until this book was nominated for my Book Club, I had never heard of the Halifax Explosion, a catastrophic event in 1917. The scale of the event with its tragic outcome for so many civilians was matched only by the instant and open-hearted response by large numbers of Canadians and Americans who sent medical teams, workmen, equipment, food, and money raised to help the survivors.My main criticism of the book is that the author has found it necessary to cram in every single fact he possibly could, and many of these seem to be only marginal in their link to the main story. One particularly irrelevant aside concerned one of the early helpers, Joseph Barss. Some time after the event, he went to the University of Michigan to study medicine:""He also sang in the First Congregational Church under the leadership of Lloyd C Douglas, who would go on to write ""The Robe"", which sold 2 million copies and became a movie starring Richard Burton.""Did we really need to know that?Another irritation was his lapses into into jokey asides which for me jarred given the nature of the horror to which he was leading up. For example, in writing about one large family:""With 14 kids, the milking cow in the backyard wasn't for show-and-tell.""Don't publishers employ editors any more to get rid of this sort of nonsense? And finally, the sub-title: where was the treachery in this story? There were mistakes and short-cuts piled on top of each other, which all added up to the making of a major disaster, but I don't think the word treachery is appropriate. There was no deliberate betrayal of trust or deceitful action. I assume the term refers to the pilot, captain and crew of the Mont-Blanc abandoning ship because they expected it to explode at any moment. It wasn't heroic, but it was hardly treacherous. It smacks of tabloid journalism.A riveting story, but a book marred by the author's inability to remain focussed at all times on the central tragedy which was his subject. Edited to add:Rating changed down to two stars as more inaccuracies come to light. This is cut-and-paste tabloid journalism it seems to me, and the second star is for the gripping nature of the event and its aftermath.

The boys and their friends share various experiences, sometimes involving adults, sometimes not. One moving section tells of a group of boys visiting an old man called Colonel Freeleigh who shares with them some of his memories of being in the Civil War, hazy with the distance of 70 years:""You remember winning, don't you? A battle won, somewhere?""""No,"" said the old man, deep under. ""I don't remember anyone winning anywhere any time. War's never a winning thing, Charlie. You just lose all the time, and the one who loses last asks for terms. All I remember is a lot of losing and sadness and nothing good but the end of it. The end of it, Charles, that was a winning all to itself, having nothing to do with guns.""Those boys in their twenties would in turn be drawn into the Second World War, and if they survived it, would understand what the Colonel meant.On a happier note, my favourite section came towards the end of the book where the central character's grandmother, a wonderful cook, lost her abilities by being tidied up and organised by a visiting relative. Her grandson Doug saved the day by recreating the muddle of her kitchen after the adults managed to end Aunt Rose's visit, so Grandma could return to her method of ""a handful of this, a pinch of that, a thimbleful of something else ..."".A beautiful book, filled with the sunshine and love of Bradbury's remembered childhood in a more innocent world....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jun 29, 2018","Jul 04, 2018","Jun 29, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9623.Dandelion_Wine

Last Wednesday and the Battle of Bosworth are all one; the past is the past, and Mrs O'Toole, buried last Wednesday, is neck and neck with King Richard in the hurtle to eternity. This was - it must have been - the architect's view. From the Romans to the Hanoverians, it was all the same to him; they wore, no doubt, leather jerkins and iron crowns; they burned witches; their buildings were stone and quaint and cold, their windows were not as our windows; they slapped their thighs and said prithee.

They were constantly lied to about the effects of radium, and were then fought every inch of the way through the courts as the companies tried to deny their culpability. They fought against any suggestion they should assist with the women's desperate need for financial support to deal with medical bills, let alone compensation for their suffering and their short lives.All the more power to these women for their dogged determination to fight for their rights, and to get the law changed so that there was compensation for an injury which was not immediately apparent.

Had he learned nothing from several years of reading history?Other irritations included the way the story occasionally turns into a film script, and the way that in the sections dealing with Germans, the English text is larded with German words.

I love Trollope's observations of the foibles of his characters and while some verge on caricature, most have strengths and weaknesses, as do we all. There is great fun in loathing the villain, Obadiah Slope - and how could he not be villainous with such a name! Eleanor Bold is the central female character, and how much more interesting a person she is than nearly all of Dickens' insipid female heroines. (Of course I have a soft spot for her because she shares my name.) However, it is hard to go past Mrs Proudie, the Bishop's wife, as being the star turn of the book. She rules the Bishop, and everyone else, with a rod of iron. After a minor rebellion, encouraged by the aforementioned Slope, he was brought safely back under his lady's thumb, and Trollope's comment on this was: ""Oh, husbands, oh, my marital friends, what great comfort is there to be derived from a wife well obeyed."" (I read that sentence out to my own husband, who laughed in fellow sympathy with the Bishop!)What I enjoy most of all though is Trollope's observation of behaviour and his psychology is spot on. Take for example the following passage, in connection with the very late arrival of an important guest at the home of the Thornes:""Wise people, when they are in the wrong, always put themselves right by finding fault with the people against whom they have sinned. Lady De Courcy was a wise woman, and therefore, having treated Miss Thorne very badly by staying away till three o'clock, she assumed the offensive and attacked Mr Thorne's roads. Her daughter, not less wise, attacked Miss Thorne's early hours. The art of doing this is among the most precious of those usually cultivated by persons who know how to live. There is no withstanding it. Who can go systematically to work and, having done battle with the primary accusation and settled that, then bring forward a countercharge and support that also? Life is not long enough for such labours. A man in the right relies easily on his rectitude and therefore goes about unarmed. His very strength is his weakness. A man in the wrong knows that he must look to his weapons; his very weakness is his strength. The one is never prepared for combat, the other is always ready. Therefore it is that in this world the man that is in the wrong almost invariably conquers the man that is in the right, and invariably despises him.""Wonderful stuff....more",Notes are private!,0,16,2,"Mar 11, 2018not set","Mar 30, 2018not set","Mar 11, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/125321.Barchester_Towers

I have just finished listening to this as an Audible book, read by Frederick Davidson, who does a superb job. It clocks in at over 35 hours of listening, and I have to say that I thought there was a fair amount of padding in there. Not surprising given that Dickens was writing it as a serial and was no doubt paid by the yard. There were some great descriptions of the countryside gradually becoming the city as one of the characters rode in a coach towards London, and another of a coach ride during a ferocious storm. There is murder, greed, selfishness, slyness, sentimentality, all of it served in large dollops. I feel quite exhausted! And I must confess that I find characters like Sarah Gamp, who is supposed to be funny, utterly unfunny. My loss no doubt.I'm glad I listened to it, but doubt I shall do so again.

What does it say about a society and its attitudes to minorities that people feel the need to ""pass"" as something other than what they are? In this book, written in 1929, a light-skinned woman of colour is living a lie, pretending to be white and married to a racist. The stress and danger this puts her in is palpable, especially when she feels a yearning to return to Harlem to mingle with people she had known in her childhood.In the same way, our society forced people with a sexual orientation other than heterosexual to live a life of concealment of their true natures and feelings - and in many places, it still does so. How destructive and soul-destroying this must be to the individual, we cannot begin to imagine if we are members of the majority who consider their way of being is the only correct one.We need to learn not merely tolerance, but true acceptance if we are to achieve real equality, and if all members of society are free to be themselves and live to their full potential. ...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Jan 30, 2018","Jan 31, 2018","Jan 31, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/349929.Passing

Part of this year's reading plan (such as it is) is to read ""The Chronicles of Barsetshire"". The first volume is ""The Warden"" and its central character is Septimus Harding, the Warden of what is in effect a retirement home for 12 old men of the city who are no longer able to work and support themselves. He is a gentle and sensitive man, ill-equipped to deal with the storm which breaks over his head when a young man bent on reform calls his position and its generous income into question. The various characters are beautifully drawn. Here for example is the Warden's son-in-law, the formidable Dr Grantly:""He has all the dignity of an ancient saint with the sleekness of a modern bishop; he is always the same; he is always the archdeacon; unlike Homer, he never nods. Even with his father-in-law, even with the bishop and dean, he maintains that sonorous tone and lofty deportment which strikes awe into the young hearts of Barchester; and absolutely cows the whole parish of Plumstead Episcopi.""As the story unfolds, Trollope examines the foibles of his characters, and also larger questions such as the difference between law and justice. The questions he asks are as relevant today and when he wrote them in the middle of the 19th century.A solid 3.5 stars.

I am not sure whether the book is aimed at teenagers rather than adults, but I found it jarring when modern slang was used: for example, Loki saying ""No problem"", and Thor saying ""Bully for you."" I am not very familiar with the myths, but I have always had the impression that Loki the trickster should be taken rather more seriously than being depicted in the earlier stories as something of a smart-arse teenager. To me he seems something like Lucifer, all the more so when we come to Ragnarok. However, I did like the way that Gaiman finished the book.

My favourite was the final one in the book, The Sidmouth Letters. What if Jane Austen had sent letters to a man with whom she was in love, who did not receive them, so that they were returned to the address where she had been staying? If you were given them, what would you do with them? A delicious moral dilemma about the right to privacy no matter how famous a person is. I also particularly enjoyed The Tribute, showing up the selfishness and hypocrisy of three grandes dames discussing what might be a fitting tribute to a dead woman whom each of them had exploited as nanny to their children.

I have now read Baker's other book, ""The Hill of Summer"", where he writes of observations over a six month period, gleaned from many years of returning to the same area and observing the wildlife there. Again, it was a wonderful read, though it was more general than the first book which concentrated on observations of Peregrines, with other birds being almost incidental. Baker's observations are minute, and his writing is beautiful. Here is a sample taken from towards the end of the book, describing the approach of night:""Flocks of starlings fly west toward their roosting-place; mallard go inland to feed in the stubble. There is an inevitable stillness here, like the calm solitude of still water. A meadow pipit calls as I cross the field. The green of the grass intensifies, then fades to grey. All shapes recede, then seem to come slowly nearer, as dusk deepens and day ends.There is a soft breath of parting among the brittle stems of the reeds at the side of the dyke. A short-eared owl floats up into the air. Its wings press slowly down and forward as it billows away across the fields. Gliding and banking steeply, it fades through the dusk. All around me, I hear the calls of golden plover rising like a mist of sound....Deep in the afterglow, the gently imploring calls of partridges breathe upwards, like smoke-curls of autumn dusk. A hare runs into the dark corn. The empty land reaches out beyond the dusk, into the dews of night, into the fields of stars.The estuary sinks slowly down below the black rampart of the farm, with all its brightness held up to me for the last time in one great flashing rim of light. Then I go inland, into the dark country of the minatory owls.""...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Jun 21, 2017",Jul 2017,"Jun 21, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11037701-the-peregrine

Yes, I loved ""The Thirteenth TalA lot of readers seem to have been disappointed that Diane Setterfield's second book wasn't just like her first book. Yes, I loved ""The Thirteenth Tale"", but I enjoyed this very different story too. It is a study of a man who fears death so much that he works himself to death in an attempt to deny its existence. In doing this of course, he completely fails to live the life he has, with all its joys and sorrows. The story is set in Victorian England, but is just as relevant to the way in which people today fail to cherish the life and the relationships they have, and the beauty and wonder of the world around them. For him, the Rook is a bird of ill-omen.As a stark contrast to Bellman's way of life, his artistic daughter Dora finds happiness and joy despite her physical weaknesses which resulted from a close brush with death in her childhood. At the end of the book, she is taken to see a huge gathering of Rooks settling for the night, and the description is stunning:""Somewhere, invisibly, at the heart of the mass, a single rook readies its muscles. Now it flaps and rises. A thread of birds is drawn up, out of the mass, a line that rises, coiling and twisting into the dusky air. It thickens at its base, spirals up, and paints shapes on the sky: swirls and eddies, like black dye dropped into water. Endlessly and unexpectedly shifting, it is hard to believe that these are individual birds; it seems to be a single force that animates these fantastical forms in the sky.The dark lake of birds shrinks as the black mass flows upwards from its centre, more and more joining the whirling dance flight until the last birds leave the ground and the entire parish is twisting and writhing as one force in the air. There is no time. Future and past are banished, and this moment is all.""A ghost story?

Fortunately things have changed since then and the Peregrine is now safe again. The book is the result of 10 years of observation, distilled into one period from autumn, through winter and into spring.Baker's writing is exquisite and on nearly every page there are phrases and sometimes whole paragraphs that make the reader stop at their beauty:""Greenshanks stood in the marsh; hoary-looking waders, grey and mossy-coloured, tilting forward to feed over their thin grey legs. Where they were not grey, they were white; bleak, leaden birds, phantoms of summer green, suddenly aloof and beautiful in flight. Slow rain fell from mid-grey, light grey sky. A deceptive clarity and brightening at eleven o'clock meant that the rain was really setting in. For an hour, till greyness covered all, the water shone like milk and mother-of-pearl. The sea breathed quietly, like a sleeping dog.""Here is his description of the Peregrine's flight:""He flowed across the dazzling sky in one great slash of light, and flared out into the darkness of the trees.""And another passage observing the bird:""He flew south, moving like a sleepwalker, gazing forward enrapt. His wings just touched and skimmed the air. The sun shone upon him, and he gleamed like a shield of silver water, glowed purple-brown and wet like dark plough land after rain.""A wonderful book, probably particularly of interest to bird lovers, but worth reading for the language alone....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"May 07, 2017","May 13, 2017","Apr 16, 2017",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/34743010-the-peregrine

Not because of George Orwell's style, which is plain and elegant, but because of the repellant cast of characters. The only decent person was the unfortunate doctor. At the same time, I don't believe that Orwell was exaggerating the awfulness of the people. The book filled me with shame and disgust at the attitudes and moral bankruptcy of the supposedly superior white men and women. Given their attitudes towards the people of Burma, it was hardly surprising that they also saw nothing wrong with going out and killing birds and animals for no good reason. The description of Flory and Elizabeth's shooting expedition will stay with me for a long time.

It is chilling to see how quickly and thoroughly a group of thugs terrorised and subjugated a whole country.Towards the end of the book, Haffner and his fellow law students were required to undergo some military training and of course indoctrination, before they could take their final exams, an efficient way of ensuring the judiciary was a part of the system.They were in uniform and of course marching behind a flag with a swastika on it as part of their training.""When we came through villages, the people on either side of the road raised their arms to greet the flag, or disappeared quickly in some house entrance. They did this because they had learned that if they did not, we, that is I, would beat them up. It made not the slightest difference that I - and, no doubt, others among us - ourselves fled into entryways to avoid these flags, when we were not marching behind them. Now we were the ones embodying an implicit threat of violence against all bystanders. They greeted the flag or disappeared. For fear of us. For fear of me.I still feel dizzy when I consider my predicament then.

Everything but the bloodhounds snapping' at her rear end.""Despite all the s saying how wonderful, moving and generally fantastic this book was, I thought it was horribly manipulative in the way it drip-fed titbits of information about Jude's terrible abuse, so that the reader was left wanting to know more. I do not deny for a moment that there are people like Jude who struggle to live with terrible things that were done to them in their childhood. But I'm a bit doubtful that a person who is such a psychological mess would also be a terrific hot-shot lawyer, and so brilliant that he did a Master's degree in Pure Maths just for the heck of it. Of course he's brilliant at everything else too: a wonderful pianist who (apparently without ever needing to practise) sits down at his piano and tosses off Bach Partitas or Schumann's Fantasy in C. If he could play things like that, he was no slouch as a pianist. (If you are interested, here it is, played by Yevgeny Kissin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDlft... )He can sing beautifully, he can cook wonderfully, and despite being full of self-loathing, he somehow manages to have everyone who knows him love him to bits. Really?And then there's the fact that the book covers several decades. We are told from time to time that someone was now 40, or 48 or 52, but none of them seemed to change and learn. There is quite a large cast of characters, but nearly all of them are just names: people coming to a birthday dinner or going to an art exhibition. And they are all so self-absorbed that we have no idea of the outside world at all. Even cataclysmic events such as 9/11 get no mention, despite the fact that they all live in New York. Apparently they didn't notice.Jude and his three close friends (why are they friends by the way - just because they roomed together at college apparently) are all stunningly successful. An acclaimed artist, who seems to keep on churning out the same paintings of his friends (done from photographs) over the decades; an actor who becomes a famous star without any difficulty at all it seems; and a brilliant architect designing houses, museums and who knows what in America and overseas.

My main problem was with the language, and specifically the frequent use of slang, which detracted from what was supposed to be a readable but serious look at how trees in forests interact. I assume that this is down to the translator rather than the author, but would need to have that confirmed by someone who has read the German original. Words like ""critters"", ""buddies"" (referring to trees growing near one another) and ""little guys"" were intensely irritating. The worst of the lot came on page 216, where he was writing about ash dieback fungus, which had entered Europe from Asia and is destroying the ash trees in Europe. ""Its fruiting bodies look harmless, even rather cute. They are just teeny-weeny mushrooms that grow on the stalks of fallen leaves."" I wondered if each teeny-weeny mushroom had an itsy-bitsy elf sitting on it.My other disappointment was that this book was not generally about trees, but about trees in forests in Europe, and to a lesser extent, in North America. This is understandable because Peter Wohlleben manages a forest in Germany, but the title of the book suggests that he was writing about all trees. I am none the wiser about how, say, Australian trees, or African trees, might work together.

It is good to have a reminder every now and then of how incredibly fortunate I am to have been born in such a peaceful and democratic country.So I found the book very good indeed: painful in so many ways, and heartbreaking in how badly life can go wrong for someone old who insists on her privacy no matter what the cost.One of those books I shall keep on thinking about long after finishing reading it, and that to me is always the sign of a fine and powerful book....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Dec 21, 2016","Dec 23, 2016","Dec 21, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/497499.The_Door

I started by responding to another person's comment that there was not much about the Martians, which he or she would have found more interesting.The point of the book was not alien (to us) life forms, but the behaviour of humans in alien conditions.I found the tragedy of what happened all too believable, when you consider the havoc we have brought wherever we impose ourselves on a new environment, whether it is the early colonisers of Australia, or the settlers moving into the American West, the Spanish in South America, and so on.The rockets were the Silver Locusts of the original UK (and elsewhere?) title - see the very short story titled ""The Locusts"" - and they brought in them the plague of humans.""And from the rockets ran men with hammers in their hands to beat the strange world into a shape that was familiar to the eye to bludgeon away all the strangeness, their mouths fringed with nails so they resembled steel-toothed carnivores, spitting them into their swift hands as they hammered up frame cottages and scuttled over roofs with shingles to blot out the eerie stars, and fit green shades to pull against the night. And when the carpenters had hurried on, the women came in with flower-pots and chintz and pans and set up a kitchen clamour to cover the silence that Mars made waiting outside the door and the shaded window.""Again in ""The Naming of Names"", Bradbury writes of the need for the colonising people to place their own names on everything. It is only now, more than 200 years after Europeans first came to colonise Australia, that we are reverting back to the place names given by the Aboriginal people, especially for places of particular significance such as Uluru, which used to be called Ayers Rock.I read an older version of the book, with the original dates. I didn't have a problem with this, as for me it was happening in an alternate universe. However my copy doesn't have the story Usher II, so I shall be interested to hear about that one.By chance, the bookmark I was using for this book was one I received from an organisation I support called ""Indigenous Community Volunteers"". On it is quoted an Aboriginal proverb:""We are all visitors to this time, this place. We are just passing through. Our purpose here is to observe, to learn, to grow, to love - and then we return home.""Somehow, it seemed very appropriate to contemplate the truth of this, and to learn to step more lightly on our own world, rather than to continue with the frontier mentality of using up, destroying and then moving on to the next place, whether that is another part of our own land or another planet....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Jun 09, 2016","Jun 11, 2016","Jun 09, 2016",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8577197-the-martian-chronicles

What would it be like to be forgotten as soon as you are out of sight? How hard would it be to live when no-one remembers you, even to the extent of being totally neglected as a hospital patient in need of food and medication? How could you ever get and hold a job? The other major theme is western society's pursuit of and fascination with perfection in people, and the lengths to which some will go to achieve it. And of course, how and why others will manipulate that desire for their own ends.I was fortunate enough to win one of 20 proof copies for readers in Australia through Goodreads' giveaways. There were of course some typographical errors in the book. One mistake which appeared several times and was therefore not just a typographical error was a misquoting of a line from Byron's beautiful poem ""So we'll go no more a-roving"". The last line of the second verse is:""And love itself have rest"" NOT ""And love itself have a rest""!!! I do hope this was picked up and corrected before publication. The other error which grated was a reference to the poet as Lord Gordon Byron, which was pretty silly. How hard would it be to check and find that his name was George Gordon Byron, generally known as Lord Byron? Again, something which I hope was picked up before publication.

The Penguin edition I read also contains Yourcenar's Reflections on the Composition of Memoirs of Hadrian and in it she writes of retaining only one sentence from an early draft of the book, which was one which I noted as both beautiful and profound:Quote:Like a traveler sailing the Archipelago who sees the luminous mists lift toward evening, and little by little makes out the shore, I begin to discern the profile of my death. (page 16)This one I also noted and appreciated for its wisdom:Quote:... each of us has to choose, in the course of his brief life, between endless striving and wise resignation, between the delights of disorder and those of stability, between the Titan and the Olympian ... To choose between them, or to succeed, at last, in bringing them into accord. (page 121)And a quote from Yourcenar's reflections on writing the book:Quote:A human life cannot be graphed, whatever people may say, by two virtual perpendiculars, representing what a man believed himself to be and what he wished to be, plus a flat horizontal for what he actually was; rather, the diagram has to be composed of three curving lines, extended to infinity, ever meeting and ever diverging. (page 284)A wise and beautiful book. I kept being reminded of the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius (the Mark for whom the memoirs are written), and I can't give higher praise than that. Here is a quote from Book 8 of the Meditations:Quote:The first rule is, to keep an untroubled spirit; for all things must bow to Nature's law, and soon enough you must vanish into nothingness, like Hadrian and Augustus. The second is to look things in the face and know them for what they are, remembering that it is your duty to be a good man.
