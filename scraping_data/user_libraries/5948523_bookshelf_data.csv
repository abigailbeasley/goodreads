But I kind of can’t believe I spent 9 whole months reading a 2 star book so I’m giving it 3. It’s a lot. A lot of words. Not a lot of plot. So I’ll be adding Dickens to my never again list.

This is my first Eudora Welty and her storytelling is like none other. Written in the 1940s and set in the 1920s, the story tells about a week in the life of a Southern family living on the Mississippi Delta. Nothing special happens, it’s just life. But what a week it was for the Fairchilds. For a more modern perspective, imagine the chaos in the opening scenes of Home Alone (all the commotion and the various branches of the family tree all under one roof) plus the dysFUNctional dynamics in The Family Stone. That is the first 6 chapters of this book (there are only 7 chapters). The reader is inserted in the madness of a family wedding and gets to experience all of the highs and lows along the way. But Welty has this amazing ability to completely change the tone and pace once the wedding is over. I can’t say enough good things! I will note I appreciated the introduction by Anne Tyler. She gives the 21st century some things to think about when examining this type of literature. My 2023 reading project is to read the works of American female authors from the 20th century-the ones I have mostly overlooked. I am so glad I started with Ms Welty. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Dec 31, 2022","Jan 07, 2023","Dec 31, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12595.Delta_Wedding

I loved the depth expressed in these prayers. Each one is meaningful and the organization of the book makes it so the reader can flip to what may speak to them in different life moments. I highly recommend! ...more,Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Jan 15, 2023","Jan 25, 2023","Dec 23, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61153733-the-lives-we-actually-have

Many stories took me multiple days to read because some of it was quite shocking to be honest! I’m not sure what I was expecting but it was a dark reading experience. The reader must understand irony to understand these stories. Parts of it were hard to stomach, especially some of the language.

I knew in the opening pages that this book would transport me back to those early days of the pandemic. While that doesn’t sound like a pleasant walk down memory lane, I felt strangely peaceful. She captures these uncertain days with such depth and emotion, not forgetting anything: i.e toilet paper shortages and leggings as pants. She takes the reader through the racial injustice reckoning we watched that summer as well as the 2020 election and the insurrection and patiently invites us to lay down our biases. We see a wonderful mother, healing from her own wounds of childhood and striving to giver her adult children the mother she never had. We see grief over the loss of her second husband and navigating life in lockdown with her first husband! All of this in just 288 pages!

I enjoyed this debut novel told across the decades. The setting on the Caribbean islands and California beaches evoked a strong sense of place. I always love character driven novels with family at the center, and this one definitely checked those boxes. There were lots of characters and it jumped back and forth a lot so it took me a while to find the groove. I also felt there were a lot (a lot) of important issues addressed, and maybe the author should have focused on just one or two and explored them deeper. I struggled with some of their choices and had me shaking my head sometimes (mostly Benny) but I could see the theme of family and love all the way through.

When I read memoir I try not to rate based on the author’s story and more about the crafting of the book. I enjoyed this book, I listened to it (my favorite was to consume memoir) and found myself laughing and crying at various times. I felt some more editing was needed as some chapters ended on strange notes (example, one chapter ended with the exclamation “Jesus!”, it made sense on audio but I don’t think it would have in print) and some chapters could have been shorter. And why 99 chapters? I was hoping there would be a surprise 100, that would have felt more resolved, haha. As for the “tea” she spills, I felt some of it was enlightening and some felt a little petty. She critiques herself and her own actions in addition to many (many) others. I have some opinions on the Matt Laurer scandal, but I’ll save that for a conversation if anyone is interested :)One thing that bothered me was her continued mentioning of her body. It seems that she still struggles with her body image and I just wish she could use her voice to promote more body positivity. She admits to struggling with bulimia when she was younger so I don’t doubt this is an ongoing battle. It made me sad to be honest.

But despite the sadness, I definitely can say this is one of the best memoirs I have ever read. It was intimate without feeling intrusive, it told the story in great detail yet was respectful. It truly honored the friendship of Ann and Lucy. I had alternating feelings of being angry with Lucy and simply adoring her, which seems to track with all who came into contact with her. She was a tortured soul, an artist, a survivor, and so much more. Ann’s love and grief for Lucy was palpable on every page and I am thankful she shared this with her readers. Lucy’s story needs to live on, as both a tribute to her and a cautionary tale. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Aug 27, 2022","Aug 31, 2022","Jan 18, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3686.Truth_Beauty

While I enjoyed her newer fiction titles compared to her older books, each was its own world and felt very real. Jump in and learn from this author! Oh and I did make it to Parnassus this year. Ann wasn’t there but it was a lovely store. I’m not sure how I have never read anything by Ann Patchett before but I am glad this was my introduction. As crazy as it sounds, I feel like I really know her and, to be even crazier, I feel like she knows me. I can’t even rank these essays or choose a favorite.

If you loved The Jane Austen Society, you will love this follow up! Evie Stone from the society leaves small town life and emerges in London after studying at Cambridge. She pursues a job at Bloomsbury Books where she meets a cast of characters that rivals the society members. We are introduced to the shop girls-Vivien and Grace as well as the surly manager, Mr. Dutton, whose medical condition requires him to leave the shop, and the women get a chance to lead. In constant competition with the men in the shop, the ladies use their skills and smarts to increase revenue and improve upon Mr. Dutton’s famous “rules.” Each chapter opens with one of his rules and promptly expands on how that rule was broken by an employee. With lots of excitement and even some subterfuge, we are immersed in the story of these women and their quest to outsmart the men once and for all. This book is a wonderful work of historical fiction set in post WWII London and the sense of place is spot on.

The author took on a tremendous task of telling the story of those who experienced first hand the horrors of that day. I will remember many parts of this book, but the one that sticks with me is Genelle Guzman, the final survivor of the Twin Towers. She was rescued after 27 hours of being essentially buried alive. She said she prayed for 27 hours straight and she changed her life after experiencing the presence of the Holy Spirit that day. I love books that bring God into the world and her story underscored an already beautiful yet tragic account of senseless tragedy. This really should be required listening for all Americans, if not all humans. It is well worth the time spent. I am forever grateful to the brave rescue workers who sacrificed everything that day. Their story will live on through these survivors and through all who will bear witness to their story. May we never again face a day like 9/11/01. And yet may we also come together again as a nation as we did in the days after.

I have been a fan of Genova’s work ever since I picked up Still Alice at a used book sale in a beach town where I used to live. Is this an oddly specific memory? Do I remember the place I bought every book I own? No, I just encoded it with extra information like the book sale and the beach town, so my brain was more likely to remember it. Remember teaches us how the brain stores memory, how we retrieve those memories, and how we forget those memories. We learn how Alzheimer’s works and how it’s different than “normal” forgetting and memory decline. And we learn how to prevent Alzheimer’s (spoiler-get some sleep!). All in all, this book is an easily digestible manual for all things memory. If you are a fan of Genova’s books, you will appreciate her light hearted way of handling serious subjects. It felt so personal, like I was reading emails from a friend. The only criticism I had was that it left me wanting more in most chapters!

It definitely had some serious and suspenseful moments but I loved the setting and the overall plot. It had lots of twists and turns but was not overtly predictable. While many Jane Austen retellings exist, this was completely different. It takes place on 1817 at the height of Austen’s career. Our main character is a huge fan and uses the heroines such as Elizabeth Bennett, Emma Woodhouse, Fanny Price, and Elinor Dashwood, to help her make her own decisions when she is faced with similar problems to the ones Austen wrote about in her novels.

It was well crafted and had those signature Jodi moves we all know and love. But from a character development standpoint, I had a hard time. This was the least likable main character I have read in a long time. Definitely the least likable in the Jodi Picoult cannon (maybe tied with Jack in Salem Falls). I’m not sure if Dawn’s flaws were intentional or not, but they were certainly cringe worthy. The love triangle was over the top and felt so immature. Her relationship with her daughter was concerning and can’t just be blamed on teenage angst on Meret’s part. As the mom of a 13 year old, I found the writing of Meret to be stereotypical and not developed at all. The obvious fat shaming and fat phobia was alarming. I would love to see this corrected with some wonderful body positivity in another novel (maybe read Christy Harrison’s Anti Diet fora good education). Jodi, you know I love you and I will always read anything you publish, but this one missed the mark for me.**Edit to add: After sleeping on this, I feel the need to mention that the concept of the book of two ways is so interesting, albeit mind boggling, that all the character stuff I mentioned above makes it difficult to appreciate and grasp.

A nationwide blackout occurs while two brothers, John and Stewart, are home alone while their father is out of town. Luckily they have been preparing for this their whole lives. Their dad is a prep master and has food and water stored up that will last for months. But all of that means nothing when it gets stolen. So John and Stewart set off on a 96 mile journey to a nearby family friend’s home. But they must do it all in three days, their lives depend on it. Not far into their journey, they meet a brother and sister pair that join them on their quest for safety. They face many challenges together and learn a lot about sacrifice and bravery, with a few surprises for the reader. Overall I really enjoyed this book. The pacing was off in a few places though.

This one made me want to throw it across the room. But not really, because it was on my Kindle and I love my Kindle way too much to hurt it. Book 2 dives into the life of the now Queen Beatrice. Both books are told in the voice of four different characters, which felt a little too much, especially in Book 2. We have Beatrice, sister Samantha, Samantha’s friend Nina, and the foil-Daphne Deighton. Each one of these young ladies has a love interest in Book 1 and then they swap partners in Book 2, as if they are at a square dance rather than a palace. Basically, the theme of Majesty is “love the one you’re with.” It felt so immature and downright frustrating at times. Daphne, in particular, drove me crazy and I felt the author really missed some opportunities with this character. In fact, the word “comeuppance” came to mind many times while reading, but evidently never crossed the author’s mind while writing. My biggest beef-and fair warning, this is a rant coming on-was ALL THE DRINKING! Oh my, these kids drank all.the.time. If a bad decision needed to be made, you can bet there was alcohol (or Daphne) involved. In this version of America, the drinking age is 18, which is pointed out in both books, I guess to make sure it is clear they were “legal.” But why do this? It felt like sloppy writing, not to mention, horrible to feature so prominently in a YA book. While the author made sure to include LGBTQ characters and some discussion around racism and interracial relationships, she certainly didn’t see a problem with drunken decision making. I can't recommend this one. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Nov 27, 2020","Nov 30, 2020","Nov 27, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/51338797-majesty

Emma comes along but the marriage doesn’t. All Len wants is his daughters and he is surprised Laurel gives them to him without a fight.

The novel attempts to answer the questions of what does a mother look like? How much does biology really matter?

However, if you know Disclaimer: If you have never read Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte, then you may enjoy this book as a suspenseful, exciting story. However, if you know and love (or even just know) Jane Eyre, then you may get a little upset with this one. Read on.Jane is a young woman with a troubled past. She grew up in the foster care system and had a rough experience being passed around from house to house and group home to group home. She reinvents herself and even takes on a new name and leaves her old life behind. After some false starts, she finds herself in Alabama and takes on a job as dog walker in a posh neighborhood-Thornfield Estates. Soon she meets Eddie Rochester who adopts a dog, Adele (are you catching on yet?!) and she begins to work for Eddie. They begin to fall for each other and things move rather quickly towards engagement. Eddie is a widower whose wife, Bea (short for Bertha, but you already knew that) was thought to have died in a boating accident. While some folks are surprised Eddie moved on so quickly after Bea’s death, Jane is happy to take her place. The catch comes when the narration shifts to Bea’s voice and we learn that she is not in fact dead, she is actually hidden in Eddie’s house in a special panic room. Just when Jane thinks she has shed her traumatic past, she finds herself walking right into a new, even harsher reality. Will she learn the truth about Bea? Is she really safe in Eddie’s arms? The reader is taken on an adventure of many twists, turns, and dives in The Wife Upstairs.I have to admit, I am struggling with this one. I have read Jane Eyre twice, once in high school and once in my early 30s. I read it differently at those two unique periods in my life. I am a Mr. Rochester fan, I just am. And I’m not even sorry. But Eddie? Just not the same. At all. I enjoyed the pacing and suspense in this book, but I am afraid Charlotte Bronte may be turning in her grave. While there are many character names that are exact references from Jane Eyre, and Jane herself has a traumatic past separated from her family, the similarities grow thin the more the story evolves. The twist takes it very far away from Jane Eyre, to the point the comparison completely dies. I also wish it had a few less f-bombs, which I find tacky. Especially taking a famous quote like, “Reader, I married him” and changing it to something far less savory (I’ll leave this to your imagination). In short, I don’t recommend, unless you are not invested in Jane Eyre and don’t mind the f word.Regardless, I am thankful to NetGalley and the publisher for the advanced copy in exchange for my honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Aug 04, 2020","Aug 06, 2020","Aug 02, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/52510974-the-wife-upstairs

But it all feels wrong because her brother isn't there to share it with her. Eric died by suicide just a few months before her college journey began. After being diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, he ended his life at the same university where she was entering as a new student. Now Cady is struggling with this missing piece in her life but also with the puzzle of why Eric ended his. She throws herself into this quest to understand her brother's final moments and winds up in a scary situation all of her own. Not long after she arrives at Harvard, Cady begins hearing voices. This all too familiar scenario makes her question if she is destined to end up with the same illness as her brother. But things begin to take a different turn for Cady as she begins to unravel both her story and Eric's story and finds that they are very much intertwined. Cady begins making it her mission to untangle them and what she finds out may cost her everything.Overall, I enjoyed this fast paced and suspenseful first novel from Francesca Serritella. The story flowed well and was hard to put down! There were many twists and turns, some I saw coming, some I did not. I feel she painted a very clear picture of the general pressure that comes with being a college student. She also did a good job showing a grieving family, especially survivors of suicide. I would have liked to have seen some more mental health supports mentioned in the book (i.e. crisis lines, grief counseling, psychoeducation around a serious mental health diagnosis such as schizophrenia). There were some confusing plot points, especially with the ghosts. While they are obviously important to the story, based on the title, I had a hard time taking them seriously. I appreciated the research that went into creating their characters, but I found them out of place with the rest of the story. I wanted them to fit more witt Eric's experience. The other confusing point was related to Eric's condition. I found myself doubting whether the schizophrenia diagnosis was accurate or not. That may be due to the fact I am a mental health professional and kind of a diagnostic nerd! But it did feel slightly confusing at times. Overall, I recommend this book.

The first reaUpdate: I finished my second reading of Magic Lessons by Alice Hoffman and I can honestly say everything I wrote below still holds true. The first reading was very intense and I flew through the pages, to the point I didn’t remember all of the story! But this time I was able to relax and savor it, although I still found myself holding my breath from time to time. I caught things I missed and experienced the sights and smells once more. I’m sure I’ll return to it again and again and find new treasures each reading. Alice Hoffman may have just written the very best book ever to be written! If I could give it 10 stars, I would! While I’ve been a Hoffman fan for a long time, I didn’t read Practical Magic until Rules of Magic came out in 2017. Magic Lessons tells the story of how it all began for the Owens family. We first meet Hannah, who gives Maria a home and is her first teacher. We follow Maria through many adventures, including a wonderfully visual trip to Curaçao and then a harrowing journey to Salem, Massachusetts and later to New York. We watch Maria fall in and out of love and experience the joy and pain of motherhood. We experience alongside Maria what it feels to be treated horribly for no reason other than being true to oneself. And above all, we experience Magic like no one else can deliver. Throughout the book, Hoffman tells us her signature story of mothers and daughters and the lengths they go to for one another. She uses the most descriptive imagery for the beautiful flora and fauna along the journey. She writes about teas and cakes and other fantastic concoctions.There were many times reading this that I caught myself holding my breath from anticipation. I literally did not want to stop reading this book. I, almost defiantly, put it down for a day just to make it last a little longer. I cannot stress enough how perfect this book is. I will be pre-ordering so I can read again and again along with the other Owens family stories.

This story starts with Coriolanus as a young man, getting ready to finish high school and preparing for his future. Life in the Capitol hasn’t been the same since before the war. The Snow family once enjoyed many luxuries but were now living on a shoe strong budget. Coriolanus is counting on getting some type of scholarship so he can attend the University. He knows this is the only way to rise above his family’s circumstances.The 10th Hunger Games is almost here and this time the Gamemakers are using Snow and his classmates to act as mentors for the tributes. Snow sees this as his chance to make his mark. What happens over the course of the Games and afterward was certainly not in his plan. But it will determine his future.Review: I loved it! I’ve read The Hunger Games trilogy at least 4 times and enjoy the story very much. Getting to dig into the main “villian’s” backstory was very interesting and enlightening. I always find myself drawn to the bad guy in stories, I want to understand what made him or her bad. And in Snow’s case, we get to see it unfold, which I found fascinating. True fans of the novels will appreciate some of the references and will pick up on some connections throughout the book.

Get into the good school, find the right job, meet the guy, find the perfect job, get engaged, get married, buy the house, and maybe one day, have the kid. So far, everything is going according to her plan. She has made it to the ""get engaged"" moment and it is perfect. She has the man of her dreams and everything is on track to meet all of her goals. But the night of her engagement, something makes her swerve off course. She dreams a very vivid and real dream that it is 5 years in the future and she is in a different apartment and has a different ring on her finger, and there is a different man in her life. She wakes up suddenly and tries to forget. 4 and a half years go by and Dannie still hasn't set a wedding date...life keeps getting in the way. One night she and her fiance meet her best friend, Bella, for dinner on a double date only to find that her best friend's date is the man she dreamed about. All Dannie can think about why he is in her life and more importantly, how she can change the future. Along the way, Dannie has to learn many hard lessons, including accepting the unexpected.Review: Told from Dannie's perspective, this fast paced and heart breaking novel, examines love and one's chosen family. The author uses ""the dream"" to frame the entire story and I loved the feel and rhythm of this book. It feels suspenseful knowing Dannie is on somewhat of a countdown. This isn't a romance book (believe me, not my thing) but it is a love story. It is a rather short novel, which made it a fast read, but I found myself wanting more. I would have liked to have seen a little more plot development before the story's major twist occurred. But overall, I really enjoyed and would recommend to anyone wanting a heartfelt, yet not sappy, summer read. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"May 17, 2020","May 18, 2020","Apr 07, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/51865702-in-five-years

I feel they were a realistic example of a family in the aftermath of this type of death. The author did a good job matching them up together. I highly recommend this book for middle schoolers and grown ups.

The first half of the book gives a good education about child development and how anxiety and fears manifest at different ages. Parents are encouraged to examine their own reactivity and anxiety. The second half is examples of various scary situations (i.e fears of school shootings, house fires, storms, bullying, etc) and sample dialogues between parents and children. Told with “red light” and “green light” examples, parents can see themselves in these responses. I admit it became quite repetitive as the dialogues were slightly formulaic. Overall this is a good introductory book for parents to talk about scary situations. I feel the first half will be helpful to study while the second half may be helpful to skim and refer back to as needed. I also felt it needed a stronger conclusion. It ended abruptly and the epilogue was not enough to tie the two halves together.

It filled in a lot of gaps for me about Korea and Japan in my history knowledge base. I appreciated the family loyalty and hard working spirit that was obvious in the Korean family that is the center of this novel. While most of the action takes place in Japan, I felt most connected to the tiny seaside village of Busan in Korea (appropriate because that truly was the heart of the novel).

For more s, check out my new blog at www.everydaymamabooks.comSummary: Henna House tells the story of Adela Demaris, a Jewish woman from Yemen. She begins recalling her life as a young child, the only girl in a house of boys. She was born in the 1920s, during the time of the Orphans Decree, which allowed the Arab Inman, also known as “The Confiscator,” to take orphaned Jewish children and adopt them into Muslim families, thereby converting them to their new religion. To protect a young child, it was necessary to betroth at a very young age, some even were betrothed in utero. Adela has pretty bad luck with all of her betrothed and by the age of 8, she was practically an old maid. Finally she is engaged to a cousin she has never met and her family can breathe a sigh of relief. Her cousin becomes a friend and together they plan a future. Even as children, they knew there was more for them than what their little Yemen town had to offer. Their relief is short lived as circumstances change and Adela’s future is no longer secure. But her salvation comes in the form of some estranged extended family that enters their lives, and they brought a new character with them: Henna. As Adela’s story unfolds, she has to learn to navigate the world, which often is unkind, and find her identify. Henna plays an important role and will lead her to many truths along the journey. Review: Adela’s story takes many tragic and joyful turns, all alongside her family and her henna. Told in the first person, the author does an amazing job of weaving important history into a captivating story. I admit I am not very familiar with this part of the world and this book taught me about history, customs, and rituals important to my Jewish brothers and sisters. I highly recommend this book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Mar 23, 2020","May 28, 2020","Jan 02, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18775306-henna-house

Then Anne Shirley and Gilbert Blythe. But then came Sarah Prine and Captain Jack Elliot. In this amazing, unforgettable book called These Is My Words, we are introduced to 16 year old Sarah and are taken through 20 years as she navigates life and love in the Wild West. Set in the late 1800s, the author uses diary entries to tell Sarah’s story. I can’t even stress how much I loved this book. I read every spare minute for 5 days. Sarah is a hard working, smart, funny, and loving woman. She is wise and quick on her feet. She loves fiercely and feels deeply. I could identify with Sarah many times as she experienced being a wife and mother. I admire her work ethic and commitment to learning. She is a self taught reader, rancher, and business woman. She knows what to do when a rattlesnake is getting to close to her baby as well as when a rogue cowboy needs to be put in his place. She can handle baking pies, sewing aprons, and averting a train robbery. She is simply the best. This is a different time period and setting than my normal historical fiction choices and I am so glad I read it. The action was addicting and the love story was perfect. Sarah and Jack will forever be one of my favorite literary couples and that is saying something to add them to the list above! I am anxious to read the others in this series! ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Oct 14, 2019","Oct 18, 2019","Oct 14, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/8132353-these-is-my-words

Told in that addicting, page turning style reminiscent of Big Little Lies, Fowler paints a believable picture of two families in suburban North Carolina. As Xavier and Juniper’s story unfolds we also learn about their families, and of course, the tree that divides not only their property line but also their friendship. The story is narrated by “the neighbors” who give teasers throughout the story of the outcome of the story. The themes were heavy and timely but I have to admit felt a little forced in some ways. I have mixed feelings about the ending but any book that gets me thinking is a good book so I won’t complain! Overall, I recommend for a thought provoking and interesting read.

Ms. Harrison teaches us so much in this important book that it is difficult to summarize in a . We learn about the history of diet culture, and how it has gained attention over the decades. We learn about important concepts such as intuitive eating and Health at Every Size. We learn about the importance of community and social justice around body acceptance and liberation. We learn that health is not a moral obligation and that weight is not a determinant of our health outcomes, as many would have us believe. We learn how to support others and ourselves on this journey to freedom from the chains of The Life Thief (aka diet culture). I highly recommend this book to anyone who has ever questioned why intentional weight loss rarely works or has been stigmatized for their body size or shape. Honestly, it will open your mind and make you mad all at the same time. But then there is a peace that comes where you feel heard and seen.

Don’t panic. Just go to Amazon and preorder this book right now and all will be well. When you think of it, it really is an investment because it will go up in price when it comes out and it’s always best to be ahead of the game (spoken in my best Becky Brandon, nee Bloomwood voice). After returning to England from the States, Becky is all grown up and is a wonderful mama (mum). She has a good job, working for her best friend, Suze and is living in a fab house in the village. Her marriage is solid and while Minnie hasn’t become a big sister yet, Becky is enjoying life. But the holidays are rolling around and this year, it’s Becky’s turn to host Christmas! In true Becky form, she gets herself into many scrapes and sticky situations and she always manages to surprise everyone along the way. I feel I have grown up along with Becky over the years and I can honestly say this is the best installment yet. Maybe because we in similar phases of life and I can relate more to this Becky. Regardless, Sophie Kinsella truly delivers with Christmas Shopaholic. It will be so fun to read over the holidays in the middle of all the chaos, I mean fun.

I have always felt this desire to approach food and exercise differently than our culture does but I never knew where to start. Intuitive Eating literally fell into my lap by accident and I consider it one of the greatest graces I have received. I can’t really  this because it’s more than a book-it’s a way to view the world. I love this final quote that sums up this framework. “When you are freed from the tyranny of food and body anxiety, you have the space and renewed energy to pursue your dreams and discover your purpose in life.” If any of that resonates with you, I highly encourage you to read this book. I am grateful to these authors and researchers for this book. Written in 1995 and on its third edition, it is backed by many studies that support Intuitive Eating. Not as a weight loss strategy. Not as an exercise plan. But as a way to truly love and accept the body you were given and how to honor your body with loving kindness. Check it out, you won’t be sorry. I recommend taking your time with it though.

I watched Mr Rogers as a child but probably not as religiously as I watched The Jetsons or The Flinstones. But by re-discovering him as a 37 year old, I feel like I can learn so much from him and his wisdom. This author was fortunate to share a relationship with Mr. Rogers and it is evident they cared for one another very much. But I get the idea that he was like that with anyone with whom he formed a relationship. Mr. Rogers truly had a simple faith, as the title suggests and this author does a nice job of giving an outline of how Mr. Rogers connected with God and with others.

I got really into the last third of the book but the first two thirds dragged a little. I love this type of mystery though-anything involving pathology and forensics has always morbidly fascinated me. There were multiple intersecting storylines happening, which was slightly confusing at times but I was able to keep track. The hook was definitely opening with Tempe being buried alive and then going back and forth to what led up to it and checking back in with her in the tomb. That was a cool way of keeping the reader invested.

It shows the harsh realities of life for some children, I.e domestic violence, hunger, poverty, underfunded schools, etc. On one hand, this can help these children feel understood as they can identify with and see themselves in the characters. It can also raise empathy and understanding for children who are not exposed to the same injustices. On the other hand, I’m not entirely sure all 9-11 year olds could handle this. It takes some emotional intelligence that is not always available at this age, especially for kids who fall into the group of not having experienced this suffering. It deserves conversation though, no matter who reads it. There was a section that I loved. The teacher was reading aloud to the class and the main character said that listening to the story just made her want to dream and not worry anymore. This is a great example of why reading to kids is so important. It gives them an escape through the story but also shows them the love and care of an adult. If you work with kids or families that experience tragedy and suffering, this is a good read for you. Just discuss with kids if they read it. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Nov 13, 2017","Nov 18, 2017","Nov 13, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29283833-once-you-know-this

It was a good experience for me to get into someone else's lived experience of a very traumatic time. Ana is the exact same age as me. Both born in 1981. Except when I was 10, I was playing outside with my friends, riding bikes and skating. I had no real worries or cares. When Ana was 10, she watched both of her parents die as casualties on the Croatian civil war. When I was 20, I was in college and watched in horror (yet in safety) as the World Trade Center was attached. Ana was in college too, in New York City. Her experience of this trauma and the ensuing war was vastly different due to her past experience. War in her world meant road side checkpoints and children in combat. It meant tanks and daily air raids. In America, war was very different and didn't really change much of the day to day for its citizens. Ana's journey continues past September 11 as this author gives a heart wrenching and realistic view of the impact of war and trauma on one's life.

She loves animals so this was a good subject. It was informative about search and rescue dogs and it had some good suspenseful moments. I was really disappointed, however, by the negative body connotations that author included, in reference to Maya. It seemed sexist that the female police officer had to lose weight and struggled to get in shape to pass her certification. It is mentioned several times how she could not ""keep up"", while the male police officer is painted as this strapping masculine figure who probably has no body fat whatsoever-yet he is devoid of emotion due to grief. I wish this body shaming type narrative had been left out. I censored it as I read because that is not the culture I wish to offer my daughters. The worst was when her mother told her ""now that you have passed the test, you need to eat,"" as if suggesting Maya had been restricting herself from food.

Finley Hart is a fascinating 11 year old with an affinity for words and classical music. She loves her parents fiercely but doesn't want to tell them about the sadness and fears she experiences. She prefers to write in her notebooks about an imaginary land called The Everwood. She goes to stay with her grandparents for the summer and is amazed to find herself at the edge of The Everwood itself. Finley and her cousins embark on a summer of adventure yet she still feels sad and afraid much of the time. This book captures how a child can feel happy and sad at the same time and could be a useful resource for children who struggle with anxiety and depression. I highly recommend.

This historically accurate and emotional children's book about WWII gets 5 stars on many merits. First, it reminded me on Anne of Green Gables. Not quite the same but the idea of a mistreated little girl being taken in by an unlikely mother figure will always make me happy. Second, it was honest. Ada was a traumatized child and the author was able to capture what goes on in the brain of a traumatized child (dissociation, avoidance, anger, etc). Third, the beauty of the landscape of the village drew me in. And last but not least, Ada and Jamie and Susan are all survivors. Survivors of many different wars and their story brought so much joy to me it might as well have been my own family. Go and read this.

Each time I read about the 1800s, it fills in my knowledge gaps more and more. World history has never been my strong suit, but I am enjoying branching out. This book details the life of Queen Victoria, before she was queen and then her whole reign. I learned many new details of her life I did not know (she was a little crazy to tell you the truth!) and it made me love her even more! The pictures were very interesting too. I can't get over how much Bertie (her eldest son) looked like Czar Nicholas II (of course, his son-who became King George V-was Nicholas twin cousin (once removed-ish).

The writing itself was beautiful. The story was very boring in many ways. The last 25% really picked up and I flew through it in a few days (after taking 7 months to read the first 75%!). It was very spiritual (which I did not expect) and Levin really grew on me and I came to love him in the end. And Anna? I can't even talk about Anna. The phrase ""hot mess?"" Anna.

I like Jen Hatmaker's witty, slightly self deprecating and sarcastic tone on Facebook. The full length book, howeveI really wanted to like this book. I like Jen Hatmaker's witty, slightly self deprecating and sarcastic tone on Facebook. The full length book, however, was just a little much for me. Don't get me wrong, it had its moments where I laughed and was thought provoking at times. I could identify with much of it, being a product of 90's youth group culture and attending an evangelical college and even being married to a pastor. I have had a similar transformation of theology and thought processes regarding the church and Christianity in general. My problem is I felt this book was too ""fluffy"" and not well developed at all. First, the concept of Grace was not really fleshed out. It was brought up in the beginning and briefly mentioned a few times. This was surprising given the title of the book. Second, the humor. While i enjoyed parts of the more humorous sections, the way they were interspersed between more serious essays made it almost impossible to ""sit with"" or wrestle with the more difficult topic. One just went from serious to funny and this doesn't leave time for reflection. Also, the humor is reflective of her position as an upper middle class Christian mother of five in the suburbs. Third, many of the community building issues addressed (supper clubs, front porch church, etc) seem like great ideas. For Jen Hatmaker. She obviously has the gift of hospitality. But this doesn't work for everyone. Community can and should be created everywhere. At the gas station pumping gas next to the minivan full of kids or next to the homeless person asking for money. Community can be at the local playground. It doesn't always involve opening ones home and cooking. Close knit ""Couple friends"" may be necessary for her but they aren't for me. Lastly, Jen's writing seems to be more like journal entries of her own thoughts and reflections on other authors' writings. I didn't see much I hadn't already heard before. Also, She definitely wrote to her specific audience and if one isn't married with children, it may be difficult to relate to much of the content. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Apr 11, 2016","Apr 16, 2016","Apr 07, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23647129-for-the-love

Lisa Genova has quickly made it to the top of my favorites this year. I enjoy the education about the various cognitive/neurological diseases she gives within a backdrop of a family battling these viscous beasts. This book gave a beautiful look into Huntington's disease, it held nothing back but also gave a sense of dignity to those fighting. It showed the emotional struggle that goes unspoken much of the time, for the sick person as well as the family. I think the different perspective of Joe and Katie was just the right balance.

I listened to this book as my second reading and all my feelings remained pretty much the same. Her husband disappointed me but it may also be a realistic picture of what happens. The writing is truly amazing. I love how even the narration changes are Alice’s disease progresses. It still makes me want to change careers to cognitive psychology. I highly recommend this as well as all of Lisa Genova’s books. This book was both fascinating and heart breaking at the same time. Although I don't have any direct experience with Alzheimer's Disease, especially early onset, I have always been very interested in it. When I was back in college taking psychology classes, I even considered furthering my studies in cognitive psych to study Alzheimer's. Still Alice was an intelligent and well written first person account of this disease and the toll it takes on both the person and the family. Written from the perspective of Alice, a brilliant neuro psychologist, makes the irony of losing her memory very strong. I loved how her children all responded and changed with her diagnosis and the fast progression of her illness. Her husband's responses would make me cry on one page and then make me mad the next page. But it seemed to be a realistic picture of how a family may react in this situation. The author holds a PhD in neuroscience herself, and while the novel is very factual, it doesn't read like a textbook in any way. So, yes, 5 stars for Still Alice. Read this if you are even remotely interested or know someone with this horrible and heartbreaking disease....more",Notes are private!,0,0,2,"Sep 25, 2017Jan 04, 2015","Sep 27, 2017Jan 07, 2015","Jan 03, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2153405.Still_Alice

I never saw the movies (well I did see the first movie when it was in the theater but I fell asleep) and I had always written them off as ""not my genre."" But over the last several years, I began challenging myself to expand my horizons and I have picked a different genre each year to focus on. This year was fantasy and the Harry Potter books were a wonderful choice to begin. And since I have been under a rock apparently, I knew nothing of the story and was able to discover it as I went, which was really fun. Each book grew on me more and more and I can honestly say I loved them all. But this last one was such an amazing ending to this series. I feel Rowling really tied up many loose ends and gave closure to her characters, which with the massive following was probably necessary. It had sweet moments, funny moments, scary moments, sad moments and cry my eyes out moments. I wish I could pick one character or story line I loved the most but its so hard to narrow down. So here is my top 10 to round out my  on this series.10. Dobby and Kreacher. I love the continued story with the elves and of course Ron's concern to free all the elves at Hogwarts and Hermoine's response made my laugh and cry. 9. Mrs. Weasley's confrontation of Bellatrix. Wow, that is one good red headed mama.8. Luna. She cracks me up.7. The Malfoys. Redemption!6. The fact that these kids go through 7 years of school and all these adventures and don't ever use a phone or a computer. I know those are Muggle inventions and all but it was refreshing!5. Dudley! He's growing up!4. SNAPE! Oh my! I love the concept of the Penseive (wish I had one!) and I was glad to see it used in such a powerful way here.3. Dumbledore. I heart him. But it was good to get a different view, he wasn't perfect and he knew it. 2. Ron/Hermoine. Best friends turned into true love is always the way to go. They had to suffer alone and come back together enough to know it is real.1. Harry of course. The Epilogue. Everything. I'm a little sad that it's over.

For many, it seems a death sentence and they have to learn how to turn that around. For some, the diagnosis brings relief as it explains so much about their child. Regardless of their feelings about it, the child needs to be seen as a child and not his or her diagnosis. This book, written by a person on the spectrum, is an excellent description of how the autistic brain works.

Felicity is only described as beautiful, gorgeous etc when she loses weight: multiple descriptions of characters using their body type to assign value; and most egregious may be the use of The Biggest Loser tv show to ground the beginning of the story.

I dreamed about them and woke up thinking about them. Pretty much all the hallmarks of an incredible book. I loved his writing style and the fact that these were smart teenagers. Not perfect, but smart. I loved that there were 2 sets of involved parents, and that emotional expression was valued in their families. While this was a tearjerker, I did not feel emotionally manipulated. I truly felt drawn to these characters and appreciated the way the author makes you care about them. The love story is powerful but the friendship that exists among this group of teenagers is also rare-the kind of friends I would want to have if I ever found myself in this horrible situation. I also have to add how its funny how things converge in life. I JUST finished the Anne Frank's diary and here it is playing a pretty significant role in this book. I would recommend this to anyone who loves someone. While it is classified as young adult, it was still a challenging read, both in the themes and language.

I love how he sees the world and copes with his mental illness. This was a realistic view of family and the lengths we go to for those we love. Every character in this book touched me in some way and I just want to sit down with all of them (yes, I know they aren't real!!). I know it is a good book when I keep thinking of the characters after its over and I am certainly doing that now. 1/22/2016-I listened to the audio version of SLP this week and all of my feelings were the same, if not better, for this book. This time, I really saw how similar Pat was to his father and brother. The reality is, his dad and brother have a lot of the same mental health issues but Pat went too far which required a change in his life. I really think he is better off than his dad in a lot of ways. And the idea of ""being kind rather than right"" just makes good sense! I love the author's way with words and how he uses repetition in just the right way. The ""montage"" is my favorite part, along with the dance competition. All in all, an excellent book about love and families. This will definitely be one I return to every few years. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,2,"Aug 17, 2020not set","Aug 20, 2020Jan 17, 2016","May 04, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13539044-the-silver-linings-playbook

But bearing witness is important and I committed to finish it when I opened the first pages. Anne was such a normal girl in so many ways but then was wise beyond her years in others. She fought with her mother and was boy crazy and wanted to do great things with her life. In many ways she reminded me of another Anne I love (Anne of Green Gables). She was an exceptional writer and it is a real shame her life was cut short although her meticulously kept diary has served an amazing purpose for many decades. I will forever be grateful to her for her honesty and genuine spirit. ...more,Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Sep 04, 2013","Sep 13, 2013","Apr 14, 2013",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/48855.The_Diary_of_a_Young_Girl

But this book left me more curious about the author than it did about myself or even the subject in general that the book addressed. Maybe it's the psychology side of me, maybe it's not, but I couldn't make sense of a lot of this. So much of the focus of this book just felt like common sense to me and it felt unorganized at times. I did not like the last lines. On a positive note, I enjoyed her thoughts on World Vision and her trip to Bolivia. Also the social justice chapter was very well done. This book also made me grateful to belong to a denomination that encourages open thought and dialogue and of course, women in ministry. For those that have been hurt by the church, this book may help you see things differently and may be good.

Coming at the end of the Anne of Green Gables series, it tells the story of Rilla, Anne's youngest child. It is set during WWI, and tells the story from the perspective of Rilla and the rest of the family who are at home in Canada while many of their boys go off to the front lines. Rilla is forced to grow up during this time and leave her silly girlish ways behind. Rilla is a different character than Anne. She is rather whimsical and can wax poetic like her mother but she lacks ambition-something that changes as she grows. Rilla is just as loveable and I was constantly rooting for her. L M Montgomery is a true story teller. I felt like I was at Ingleside with the family as I read this book. Laughter and tears were common and the ending is just perfect.
