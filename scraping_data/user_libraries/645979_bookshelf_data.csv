I think this book needs another re-write or two. Published prematurely I think. Rearrange some of the chapters, start them in different places, and give us more psychological drama--could be a winner....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Sep 07, 2015","Sep 07, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22557272-the-girl-on-the-train

Over the last few weeks I've been wedged between crazy women. Overbearing women. Women I hate andI think The Universe is trying to tell me something. Over the last few weeks I've been wedged between crazy women. Overbearing women. Women I hate and fear. Women I'm afraid I'm becoming--if I take one step in the wrong direction--one day, peering through the slats of cheap metal blinds at a world I do not understand, and more to the point, a world I despise.Ok, anyway. The women. First: Amanda in The Glass Menagerie. When I was a sophomore in college, I had to play the Amanda role for a scene in my acting class. It was frightening to me, being in a class with people who were much cooler than I was. Frightening to me to have a scene partner who reeked of booze and had bad breath. Frightening that ""acting"" isn't as easy as it seemed when I was in high school. Frightened that I sucked. We're doing this play right now at the theatre where I work. I watched the final dress rehearsal this past weekend and couldn't take my mind away from darkness. And now: Clair Knightly, Helen's mother. A clinically depressed, agoraphobic bitch. And much like Amanda, she creates a wretched co-dependency with her children that causes them to attempt to survive living paralysis. It's heartbreaking. Helen is destined. Desperate. Justified? No. Yes. Either way...The book is not necessarily well-written (except for sometimes when it's awesome), especially after reading The Lovely Bones (which is basically what every single goodreads  says, too), but when it comes right down to it, I think it's a pretty realistic, or at least insightful, telling of how some of us can be royally fucked up in the head. And why most of us should never ever ever have children. Because most of us fall along the spectrum somewhere between bitches and bonkers, and then the cycle just perpetuates itself--mommy, baby, mommy, baby, crazy, mean, crazy, mean. I'm afraid it might happen to me. Maybe this is why God or The Universe or whoever's out there has not let me be a mother yet. Is that what you're telling me, Universe? Or is it just that Control isn't all that important in the big scheme? Or maybe simply that I don't have it so bad afterall. So far. Hmmmph.Tomorrow, I will send my mother flowers. Or maybe a Ferrari. I might be a little fucked in the head, but at least it's not because of her.

So there it sat on my shelf year after year, waiting for me to be in the mood to read a story about a crime-fighting sheepdog. The day finally came and I geared myself up for some silly stories with a jovial tone. And about a half-chapter in, I regretted my choice of novels. Good grief, the writer was taking himself wayyyyy too seriously. There was no silliness in this book! No witty quips. He even used his own name as the narrator's name. And there was no talking dog or even a lassie type, just a boring ol pooch of the average variety.Meh.So I put the book down.But I picked it up again, bored, mechanically, less than half-heartedly. Not bearing to read another chapter, I decided to read the covers. Both of them. Every word. And when I did this, I discovered the key to what I'd been missing--these are the TRUE adventures of Sherlock Bones!

Quit making that face. Yank out the wedgie. Relax, man! This two-star rating bears no reflection on YOU. I’m not giving YOU two stars. I’m not even giving Tom Robbins two stars. It’s just that B is for Beer is terribly disappointing. I mean, you see the cover, right? Look at it! Look how totally awesome and retro it looks, right? You see the Simpson-esque largesse of the stein, with a hoard of dance-happy (overly long-armed) adults surrounding? They’re living the good life, gazing up at the cup which runneth over, celebrating the rush of good energy that races through any crowd of joyful imbibers.Such promise! Such hope! Can such pure, overwhelming joy really emanate from these 125 pages? When I finish reading this book, will I feel as gleeful as the people on the cover?Meh.The fact of the matter is, B is for Beer is sort of a textbook. And a boring one. It’s hard to make beer production interesting, because, let’s face facts, science and agriculture are fascinating, but not as fascinating as, say, sex. Or murders. Or time travel. (Wait, unless it’s sex with a time-traveling scientist, dragging you with him across space and time as he attempts to outrun the contract on his head!) I digress...So, yeah, B is for Beer is sorta textbooky. Even the arrival of a Beer Fairy doesn’t do much to make the adventure wilder or more brewski-like. And it doesn’t help that the protagonist is a 6-year-old girl. We’re meant to believe that this 6-year-old girl is quite cute, quite smart, and quite curious, but frankly, I don’t even buy into the fact that she’s a 6-year-old girl, let alone a cute, smart, and curious 6-year-old girl. I’m bored.Let us then quell my boredom and discuss two points which I found to be lovely, uplifting, scenic points. 1. Costa Rica. 6-year-old Gracie’s uncle moves to Costa Rica. Did you know that Costa Rica has free health care, has a zillion national parks, and has no military? Sign me up! I wanna move to Costa Rica!!! 2. Sappy quotes. As Gracie and the Beer Fairy part ways after rescuing a young ingenue from impending doom, the fairy says to Gracie, “I want you to promise me that you’ll always be this brave, that when exploiters disguised as public servants offer you protection from puffed-up dangers, you’ll turn your back and skip away. Promise me you won’t be afraid of travel, of people different than yourself, of spiders, bats, bullies, dentists, attorneys, peer pressure, bad taste, social disapproval, insecurity, Sugar Elves... That you won’t quake before old men with titles, and most especially, that you’ll never be afraid to love, not even when there’s a chance you aren’t being loved in return.” Oh. My. God. You tugged my heart strings and jerked my tears, Tom Robbins! I don’t care if it’s cliche.

It is my third cup of the day and has gone cold twice already. To me, this tea is a thing of permanence. A reminder of my father before me and his mother before him, and I suspect it will be a reminder of me to my children, if ever they are to be born. I have no memory of tea tasting new and adventurous, because it has always been. It is infinity, spherical, and permanent. I do, however, have fond and strong memories of the ever-presence of tea in this little life of mine. Drinking cup after cup, a bag at a time, when I worked in Rhode Island. Me in my little rehearsal studio with strong, sweet cups of tea in round, white mugs with an apple painted on the front. The caffeine kept me awake for hours. Today, thinking back to a sentiment from years ago, I resurrected the teapot my father bought me when I went away to college. I hope this teapot never breaks--I am sure I couldn't recover from the loss. If I were to visit my father today, he would be drinking the largest cup of tea known to mankind. A 64oz mug that my mother made a few years ago when she took a pottery class. My father's tea is weak--one generic Target brand tea bag--and scalding hot. He will microwave this tea over and over again throughout the day, and when his mug is empty, he'll start all over again. He is a chain-drinker.Tea does not remind me of my mother.There are other things that remind me of my mother--Harry Potter, New England beach vacations, Pennsylvania, a potter's wheel, Girl Scouts, veterinarians, my dead grandmother, the sci-fi channel, and infinite other things. After 317 pages, I can't tell you what reminds Isabel of her mother. Perhaps it's intangible. But, I don't think it's tea. I'm not sure I can think about this book in any solid terms. It is an ok story, but I can't pull much depth from its pages. It will not speak to me for years to come. It will only hover in the atmosphere for the next few hours or days, until something else covers it over for good. I've finished my tea. No more today.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Books mentioned in this book:The Diary of Anais Nin, 1931-1934Nicholas NickelbyDavid CopperfieldGreat ExpectationsPickwick PapersNo ExitThe Way We WereLove and DeathThe Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the SeaNashvilleBrigadoonThe King and IOn the WaterfrontA Midsummer Night's DreamThe Little FoxesEquusMarat/SadeThe Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-In-The-Moon MarigoldsOthelloCat on a Hot Tin RoofA Streetcar Named DesireGodspellThe Miracle WorkerGuys and DollsMy Fair LadyI Can Get It for You WholesaleThese are mostly plays, since Isabel was a theatre person....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,not set,"Mar 20, 2009","Mar 13, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1167169.Tea

Here are some examples of the icky ickiness Anais Nin writes about in Delta of Venus.-Dude lays in bed early in the morning, and some kids who live in the house come in and horse play around his room. He gets a hard on and encourages them to frolic about on top of the covers.-Same dude, decades later, takes custody of his teenage son and daughter. Then he fucks 'em.-A different dude burns some lady's cootch with a hot pipe.-Another dude helps some man take a dead body out of the river and then he fucks the dead body while water pours out of her orifices. -A lady rides a horse bareback, and gets all horny from the feel of the horse's rough coat against her clit.-etcEw, right? I mean, she does have some good stuff in the book, but honestly, it's so overshadowed by the ick, that it's hard to lose oneself in the writing. That being said, I'll admit that the reason we read Anais Nin in 2009 is to gain some perspective on the history of erotica, moreso than for sexy fun times. There's no doubt that Nin was remarkable--after all, she's female working in a male-dominated industry--but her writing is flat and stale (kinda like this ). Very few of her stories were fleshed out, and I found that she was missing the intense emotional connection I'd expect from a woman writer; the poeticism is noticeably absent. I'm completely and utterly disappointed. Maybe I set my expectations too high...Here's the blurb on the back of the book (this edition published in the 1970s):Thirty-five years ago, Anais Nin created the female language for sexuality. She did it for a wealthy male patron for $1.00 a page. He ordered her to ""leave out the poetry,"" but she simply couldn't. The publication of Delta of Venus now makes available to the rest of us the seductive, erotic and full-bodied nature of her writing. And it reveals Anais Nin as a woman ahead of her time.Well Mr. (or Ms.) Blurbist, you couldn't be farther from the truth. Or further.

Honestly, that confused the hell out of me. It's three little romantic chick flicks with bonus cunnilingus. (By the way, the word ""cunnilingus"" is not found in my computer's spell check. WTF?) Three little Cinderella stories, complete with boning in the backseat of the pumpkin carriage (and on the kitchen table, a swing in the woods, in an alcove of a crowded room...). At first, I was like, ""What? They're getting married? They just met two days ago."" But by the final story I couldn't wait for the proposal!

I'm going to go on with my , but you're welcome to stop reading now that you know the juicy stuff. And no, I will not go on to describe, in dripping detail, any of the aforementioned LESBIAN SEX SCENES. For shame, I know.So anyway, a while back, my friend Coventry had piles and piles of books she was giving away and this was one of them. Seeing that it was written by Sarah Waters, I nabbed it immediately and placed upon my shelf, waiting for just the right time to read what I was sure would be a delightful sapphic treasure. I'd read another of Sarah Waters' books a couple years back and it was perrrrfet!  [image]With Fingersmith as its predecessor in my personal library, I had such high expectations for Tipping the Velvet. Unfortunately, high expectations nearly always lead to the most crumbling downfalls. I'll give you a rundown of the story ('cause I know you're not gonna read it, so don't be all whiney that I'm including spoilers, ok?)Nancy is a young gal who falls madly and deeply in love with a pretty woman singer who subsequently invites Nancy to go on tour with her as her dresser. Nancy very soon becomes the woman's UNdresser as well (hubba hubba) and they go on like this for a while until one day Nancy returns home to find the woman singer in bed with (GASP!!!) a man. Gross, I know. So anyway, Nancy runs away, cries a lot, and hardly eats anything for like, 2 months, when she finally gets her shit together and becomes a prostitute. Or, well, maybe a gigolo is a better term for it--she dresses up as a dude and wanders the street blowing other dudes for sixpence. One day when she's off wandering the street, a horse-drawn carriage starts following her at a short distance (scary...), eventually stopping her on a dark corner to offer her ""a ride."" Well, you guessed it, the person in the carriage is a lady. The carriage lady is very rich and takes Nancy on as her concubine. So they go on for, like a year or something, with Nancy living in the rich lady's house and being a sex slave, when finally the rich lady gets sick of Nancy and kicks her out (after finding Nancy getting you-know-what-ed by the maid) with no money or clothes or anything. So Nancy runs to this house for wayward girls and poor young couples where she knows there's a bleeding-heart young woman working and the bleeding-heart young woman takes Nancy in and eventually they become lovers (of course) but then the pretty woman singer from the beginning shows up and says, ""Nancy, come back to me!"" But Nancy's like, ""Hell no, bitch, you have a husband. Plus, my girlfriend is a super-popular, bleeding-heart socialist and all the honeys want her."" So the singer goes away and Nancy and the bleeding-heart live happily ever after. It doesn't sound like such a bad story, I guess, but the ENTIRE middle part was just so contrived and gratuitous that I almost stopped reading it a couple times. And truth be told, I only read about 3 sentences per page for one of the chapters. It's unfortunate really, because, like I said, I liked Sarah Waters' other book soooooo much. Even the ending of Tipping the Velvet, which I liked fine enough I guess, didn't redeem the middle (prostitution and sex-slave) parts. Oh well. At least I've learned that ""tipping the velvet"" means cunnilingus--titillating huh?!I shall now go back to War and Peace to read of hairy-lipped Russian girls and their (only slightly) less-scandalous love lives. In the meantime, I have two thoughts.1. If I don't want my significant other watching porn, should I be allowed to read dirty books? I hate to put forth such a double standard... But I really REALLY don't want my significant other watching porn. (Not saying that he DOES.) Alas, a dilemma.2. Nothing ever feels like a first love, does it? There is no going back.

And upon thinking for a while and discissing it with Christina for a while I've come to the conclusion that my opinion is based on a two-fold rubric. (Can rubrics have folds?)Anyway...Point 1. Character Development. The character development in this book sucked balls. And not in the good way, either. Point 2. Plot.The plot was fuckin' awesome. Except for the fact that it didn't start until a third of the way into the book. But whatev. It's still a clever story filled with science! (I love science!!!)Let's discuss the above two points in more depth, shall we? As far as character development goes, I'm really disappointed. I mean, really. Amy is supposed to be some quirky gal whose personal slang consists of ""mook,"" ""jeepers,"" and other silly stuff. But she didn't develop that characteristic until we'd met her a half a dozen times. Another example, and I'll try to spare you details, occurrs @ the end of the book. There's a reunion. And it should be romantic and touching, but it's not. It's just quick and flat. Why even bother? Pissed me off. Alrighty, plot... Underwater city and additional theories of evolution--genius! Carbon based passenger vessels navigated neurogically--double genius! Loved it. Kick ass. Cool. And then they saved the world. No surprises there.  That's all I have to say, really. The book was ok, not great. I'll probably read another Christopher Moore, but only because Christina (et al) really love him, so I figure it's worth giving him a second chance. ...more",Notes are private!,0,18,2,"not setJul 27, 2022","Dec 12, 2008not set","Nov 28, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/33441.Fluke

I've read these books a zillion and one times and surely I shall read them a zillion more. Because every single time, I realize new truths and find more honor in their pages. Today, I've read a passage that I find disturbing and quite out of character for CS Lewis: p.72 ""Shall we go farther up for you, up to the crags? There's an Ogre or two and a Hag that we could introduce you to, up there."" ""Certainly not,"" said Caspian. ""I should think not, indeed,"" said Trufflehunter. ""We want none of that sort on our side.""Seems a bit racist, if you ask me. It really makes me wonder exactly what CS Lewis is getting at here. It's totally the opposite of what happens in The Last Battle when Aslan sorts the good guys from the bad guys by whether they're good oir evil in their hearts. So anyway, it seems weird and I don't like it. The Hag does ends up being a bad guy in the end, but still... I dunno. I'll keep reading and blame the racism on the 1950s for now. Oh yeah, as a side note, whenever I read British literature, I talk to myself in a British accent and rhythm for a while afterward. It's so dorky!!!Later...I've read a bit more now. The race issue didn't come up again. The battle scenes are not the same as you might see these days. There's something more frank and quick about them. Lewis doesn't explain every little move and maneuver, so in fact, if you're reading too fast, you might even miss a fight going on. Here's an example of a battle overview without much in the way of specifics:P. 187But the new bout went well. Peter now seemed to be able to make some use of his shield, and he certainly made good use of his feet. He was almost playing Tig with Miraz now, keeping out of range shifting his ground, making the enemy work.I think if this book had been written today by a different author, it might be about 500 pages of battle scenes. I'm glad its not. Instead, the book is more about people standing on the side of good. Here's a passage that I just love which describes Edmund who may be a boy, but is also a king:P.174An hour later two great lords in the army of Miraz, the Lord Glozelle and the Lord Sopespian, strolling along their lines and picking their teeth after breakfast, looked up and saw coming down to them from the wood the Centaur and Giant Wembleweather, whom they had seen before in battle, and between them a figure they could not recognise. Nor indeed would the other boys at Edmund's school have recognised him if they could have seen him at that moment. For Aslan had breathed on him at their meeting and a kind of greatness hung about him. Ahhhhh... See? For Narnia and the North!Also, you Tolkien fans will recognize the onslaught of trees which comes in at the end of the battle--Two Towers--and the river emerging (with the help of Bacchus and his grapevines) to take out the bridge and thwart the enemy in its path--Fellowship. Who came up with it first, I wonder... :)Later still...As I finish reading this lovely little novel, allow me to drop off to sleep with feet towards the fire and good friends on either side...

Every table and shelf looked exactly the same as every table and shelf in the bookstore back home--Cormac McCarthy alongside Love in the Time of Cholera. Jane Green sidling up to Jodi Picoult. And over there, wouldn't you know it? An entire tower dedicated to the Twilight series and associated chachkis. Yep, Borders is ironically unbound by American geography. Except for one thing--Dewey. Dewey doesn't grace our Carolina shelves as abundantly as he does in the Big Apple. This little Iowa pussy has, in fact, made himself quite the cosy home on Seventh Avenue. And I just couldn't resist. Prejudjed as a comely mini-tome for housecoated grannies (regardless of the fact that our own well-respected marketing team has been giving us hairballs for weeks on end), good ol' Dewey is exactly the knitted cardigan type of book you'd expect. The only exception (and not a minor one, in this cat-lover's opinion) is that Dewey the Cat is a fucking awesome, caring, and cuddly kitty. And, true to life, he's not nearly so annoying as the narrator, the library patrons, or the townspeople featured in this quaint feline biography. Granted, I only skimmed this little novel cover to cover, but the cat is heartwarming, even if the humans are conservative lameasses.

Thank god it only took a few hours to read... First off, I'm sick to death of all the oil company conspiracy that people talk about in this country. And this whole book was about sabotaging the Alaska pipeline so some dummy could buy it out and make a billion dollars. Whatever. Secondly,it just wasn't a mission I think APO would normally concern themselves with, so I could never get into the story. And of course, the author tried too hard to make the characters talk like spies. They were always using their damn code names--something they rarely did on the show--and they were super serious about everything. None of their personalities shone through; they could have been any run-of-the-mill adventurers on a mission. Disappointing. My final point about how stupid this book is: Sydney hurled a bunch of throwing stars at the wing of an airplane as it was zooming down the runway trying to take off, and of course that made the plane crash as soon as it got in the air. Nadia shot at the plane with a machine gun which did nothing, but Sydney's throwing stars took it out???

And it's yet another dark/twised book written by a GoodReader!!! (I'm beginning to think that you people were born of the same womb and perhaps need group regressive hypnosis to cure you of your dark and twisty ways, but what do I know...)Beatie is a girl who you never really get to know. A girl who sort of slips through your day with little more than glance at best and a quick and quirky lie to your face at worst. We see snippets of a life. Is this how we see people in reality? I think probably so. **SPOILERS**Ginnetta, does she have sex with the roller rink guy? I think not, but it's hard to tell. It's the only place in the book where you shy away from biology--when we see poop and puke, I'm sure of what's going on, but the sex scene wasn't so clear. (Edit: Gennetta said no, she didn't have sex with dat boy. I read it right then. Good!)I love Petey. Absolutely ADORE Petey! What a fantastic vehicle. I think lots of kids have their own Peteys and I'm fascinated by the fact that it's so much easier for kids to use that style of reasoning, when adults just don't know how to put it into perspective. (Ok, I'm sleepy and I'm rambling.)I was really wondering for a while if Beatie is going to grow up to be crazy. She doesn't end up nutso by the end of the book, but she was still only 14 or 15. Hmmmm... I don't think this girl has an easy road ahead of her.I love your use of the word ""Episodes."" I was probably on episode 30-something before I got the double meaning: episode means a scene (as in television or something) but it also refers to a breakdown.Edit: Now that it's tomorrow and I've had some more time to think, I realize that this book makes me think of Cats Eye by Margaret Atwood. Not the style, or even the specific events of the storyline, but in the fucked up childhood sense. The girl in Cats Eye grew up to be ok. Will Beatie?

And then there are other people in the woThere are certain people in the world who have a realness, deeply rooted in the earth, bare to sun and moon. And then there are other people in the world who look at the real ones and mimic their stance, planting roots and glancing out of the corners of their eyes every once in a while to make sure they're still doing it right. But they are a forgery and it doesn't take long to tip these fakers over, upending their shallow roots. This is how I feel about Laurell K. Hamilton. The thing about fantasy writing is that you can't fake your way through it and make it seem REAL. The essence of fantasy has been around since the dawn of human intelligence--it is our religion, our myth, our history; it speaks to our connection to god, the sky, the earth, each other... and it gives voice to what the rest of us REAL creatures can feel but can't explain. So I get really annoyed when folks like LKH write twenty zillion pretentious vampire novels. I can't help but roll my eyes when the sword-that-drinks-blood begs its bearer for a sip off her own arm seven times in two pages.* It sickens me as a woman to see a cleavage-baring, curly-headed, petite twenty-something having to fuck a nest of vampires in order to save the lives of her werewolf (ex)boyfriend and his pack** after engaging in 50 pages of melodramatic dialogue and references to the heroine's scarred past.This kind of story doesn't pay homage to the REAL we saw in the writers gone before us (even if the heroes do fight a white winter witch or pass down a sword from generations of noble warriors). And it doesn't inspire us to think, feel loved, or make tangible our bond to the earth and each other. This kind of writing simply keeps a band-aid covering the wounds of lonely women who never recovered from the injuries they received in junior high. It's desperate and pathetic. I find myself creating my own fantasy that LKH takes her bajillion dollars she earns off these crappy novels and puts them into a foundation so that her readers might eventually be able to afford the therapy they really need. I can dream, can't I?*Ever so slightly exaggerated. It was maybe only five times... **This particular plot-line did not appear in this particular Hamilton collection.

I'll keep ya posted...6/25: Ok, I'm still about 200 pages out from finishing this book. I was a little hesitant at first--too damn long (550 pages) and I don't like violence, particularly Nazi violence (and civil war violence). But there really isn't any violence, or if there is, I'm too American Television scar-tissued up to notice... Anyway, now I LOVE this book and am well on my way to five-starring it!Don't let anyone tell you this book is about a little girl growing up in Nazi Germany. This book is about Death, the man. You know, cloak and sythe guy? (Don't tell him I said that.) The book is about Death walking through life, experiencing a horror like no other. And he takes moments to watch this little girl, to let his heart be warmed by her youth and growth.I hope nothing bad happens.6/27: Bad stuff does happen. Everyone she knows is obliterated. Jesus (Mary and Joseph). The death chapter at the end (just before the epilogue) takes way too long. Seems like Mr. Zusak got a bit full of himself. Which is a shame because it kinda colors the whole book now. Damn him. Great book. Loved it! Hated the ending.6/29: I wish I had ed this book before I got to the end. Because the end stole some of the beauty of the writing. For two reasons: 1, because I hate the fact that everyone in the town ended up dead. It's an issue with the storyline, that's all. 2, because Marcus Zusak went on and on and on and on about this death scene. Enough already. Stop with the flowery talk, dude. Methinks you're masturbating a bit.Because, here's the thing. The rest of the book is flowery talk, too, but it's FANTASTIC! Smells have colors, emotions have scents, visions have texture, and life is three dimensional. That's why I like the book so much. It is alive with human nature. I'm very interested in reading other Zusak--Messenger next, I think.6/30: Ah-Ha!!!! Epiphany! The reason I don't like the death scene at the end--I kinda thought Death and Liesel would have more interaction. Not that she would physically recognize him or anything, but more similar to the scene where the pilot died and Death said he knew Leisel could ""see"" him. I wish she could have emerged from the rubble seconds after the bombing and so could have been more present for this HUGE loss! Every other time some event happened, Liesel was there to witness it. The death of her brother; seeing Rudy chase her book down the river; retrieving the book from the fire and noticing the mayor's wife watching. Everything else was NOW. But this one event, was BEFORE. I long for that 'life breath' that I feel throughout the rest of the book.Also, slightly off-topic side note: I'm glad we got warned about Rudy's death long before it happened. It made me want to savor every single moment he was on the page. I love Rudy....more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,not set,"Jun 27, 2008","Jun 07, 2008",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/19063.The_Book_Thief

I think, perhaps, I'm not in the mood to listen to somebody waxing poetic about the pure drudgery of life and about how he just wishes everybody would just shut up. The fact of the matter is, they all talk to goddamn much. The whole goddamn family.I think I didn't realize that this book would be a 200 page long conversation. I sorta expected some events to take place or something. Anyway, when I first started reading F&Z, I thought, ""Holy shit! I think I might like this better than Catcher!"" But now, not so much. I'm still holding out hope. I mean, I know I'm whining quite a bit about the damn book at the moment, but over all I do like it quite a bit. 50 pages to go...9/16--I finished!!! And I have also eaten some ""chicken"" soup in celebration. Here's the thing. I think Zooey is kinda fucked up, and I don't think he's gonna get better any time soon. I think Franny will be ok, for a while, but not forever. Life is just like that, though. Ya know? No matter what, we are all gonna have times when we go through some shit, and sometimes we fully recover, sometimes we move on in pain, and sometimes we just break the hell down. Franny's breakdown was touching (bad choice of words). The kind of pain that keeps you tortured for days on end. Zooey was simply dull. Worn. Empty. This is real life, set in an eccentric homeplace, to which there can be no turning back.Perhaps I have more to say.

Ohhhhh, but I bet somebody in the world is having perfect and passionate sex right now, and they will never forget this moment as long as they live. How cool is that?~Wabi-Sabi.

Not because this teenager is necessarily more wonderful thaAt the end of chapter 13:So far this book is an inspiration of living life to its fullest. Not because this teenager is necessarily more wonderful than any other human being whose footsteps have fallen on this earth; but because you can read it and look at it from afar, and touch its edges of life lived; as if it's in a snow globe or behind a fog of time. You read and you know that there is a 90 year old woman sitting beside you, fingers outstretched, touching the same edge as you are, stirring her own past inside herself. She says she lives more fully and passionately at 90 because of this reflection of self; of the past, the present, and the future swimming together, holding hands, hearts beating in unison. 90 year old Florence will tell you that there is no separate Me Yesterday, Me Today, Me Tomorrow. There is only ME.The comments I wrote in the Chicks on Lit book club discussion after finishing the book in its entirety:As I come away from the book with some time to reflect, I find I have some overwhelming thoughts... Everything we read affects us differently depending on where we are in our lives. I am in a transition. Mourning the loss of a future I'll never have, swimming upstream through the nagging desire to make my future my own, and finally, being immobilized by the realization that decisions are terribly difficult with no black or white answers. Florence, of course, affected me becuase she was in a transition, too (what teenager isn't). I don't think she would have married if she weren't pressured to do so, though I believe that she did love Nat. (Oh, what is love anyway? Now that's a topic for another thread...) Flo wouldn't have done a damn thing to change her life if it weren't by force--the force of her parents, the force of the war, the force of simple adulthood. And as she looked back, a 90 year old woman reflecting upon her youth, she oozed a sense of loss with her words. She said (I'm paraphrasing), ""Yes I had a good life, but never the life I'd imagined."" At the end, I found myself questioning whether it's ok to live a life never imagined. Can we feel satisfied, looking back from 90 years old, if our lives veered left, right, over, under? I think not. If we want satisfaction, we must embrace the unexpected, lay aside all plans, and swing as freely on our tethers as the wind allows--only then may our aged selves sink into peace. I look to Lily Koppel as well. The image of her, standing in a pink flapper dress, the fusion of teenage Flo, crone Flo, and Lily herself beating as one heart inside one body. Lily is us. She is all of us. A woman affected by an anonymous life scribbled on diary pages. A woman in the midst of her own soul's path to peace. Is she sitting at her desk, as I am, staring up at ceiling tiles? Are you? And you and you? Are we women, as one, marching towards our future in the shadow of the adult Florence, aching to make our lives our own? I hope so. I hope we are moving forward, by inch and mile, hand in hand together, ready to take what comes. I hope for myself, that the day when I come into my crone self, I can look back and say, ""Yes I had a good life, but never the life I'd imagined... And I loved every breath!"" ...more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,not set,"May 27, 2008","Apr 29, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1704570.The_Red_Leather_Diary

That's what happened here. Big-picture-wise.Little-pictures-wise, I super loved all the beginning parts where they went off and learned all the Taos and Confucies and all and how Josh became enlightened and then decided to become a Bodhisattva for his people. I loved the Yeti parts. I loved the silliness. I loved the BFFishness. I hated all the sex. And at the end, I especially hated that I lost the humanity in Josh. He became a character I no longer felt like I was spending time with. I didn't care if he was crucified or not. And I got bored by Biff and didn't feel his emotion or reasoning (or lack thereof) or drive. It kinda sucked. Gimme 50 more pages and do some depth of character please, Christopher Moore. But anyway, did I mention how I'm a sucker for a brotherhood story? Oh yeah. Complaints aside, this book really hit the spot. I wept. And I wanna read some religious texts, too.(Ok, I cried some.

The dude self-proclaims that he's a 'good liar' and I can't handle knowing that about David...6/4: I forgot what chapter I'm on. Which sucks because I wasn't using a bookmark. Ugh.Anyway, I'm very much liking this book. It's the kind of book that blocks out my peripheral vision--the kind of book that, when I read it, I have absolutely no concept of whatever else is going on around me. This Holden guy really keeps me captivated. I feel the bits of me that are bits of Holden, too. Those bits that crave adventure, that have the speedy brain without the legs to follow, the adventuring alone bits, and the bits that can't be arsed to do a damn thing sometimes. My very favorite part so far--the part where I feel like Holden is finally able to really open up to me--is when he's repeating his thoughts after getting punched in the stomach by the elevator guy. Where he imagines a gunshot wound and an automatic, a fairy-tale interwoven through life's truths. I can't tell ya how often I do the exact same thing. Kinda fucked up in a way. I never knew there were other people who did that...6/5: I was just writing a comment about Neil Gaiman in my Chicks group. I have at least three unread Gaimans on my bookshelf at home. And I thought to myself, ""I'll read them eventually. I just have to be in the mood. [Sounds like something Holden Caulfield would say!:]"" The book is infiltrating my life. David, are you still reading this? I'm trying to write this  for me (which is why I write s), but there's an ever-present David aura around The Catcher in the Rye. Weird, weird, weird. I feel like I'm never alone. I want to tunnel into this book (remember, it washes out my periphery?), but I guess you're coming with me... Good thing I like you...6/7: Finished last night. I need to read it again. I haven't made friends with the last few chapters yet. My favorite part was when Holden was telling the story about the sappy movie he watched once about the guy with amnesia.
