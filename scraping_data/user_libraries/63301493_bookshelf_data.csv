However, “meh” is my feeling about Mansfield Park. I read it for the first time in university and didn’t get it. I went in with reasonably high expectations because I enjoyed the 1999 film adaptation and then I felt cheated. This reread does not do much to shift my feelings about this one. It’s Fanny people, she’s the centre of my struggles with MP. I want her to be more, and she just isn’t. I get that this is sort of the point of Fanny, and yet she disappoints me.So, I put down this book glad it is over, which sort of breaks my heart as an Austenite.
