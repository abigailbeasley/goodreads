Really interesting study on a relationship that jumps around in the timeline to slowly reveal how it developed, why they have the issues they have with each other, and why they are the way they are. It’s not a romcom—more intellectual, with a lot of tangents that go into psychology and emotion and brain chemistry. Sometimes I loved these rants and sometimes they went a little too far—cut them by 30 percent and the book is a 4. But at the same time, these were why I loved the book so much—it made me reflect on my own daily motives and decision making and feelings. One particular speech that happens near the Bean in Chicago toward the end of the book will stick with me forever. Love a book that is entertaining but bleeds into my life in these kinds of ways and changes my thinking. It’s a long book to commit to, and definitely not for everyone because of the deep dives, but I really enjoyed it. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Apr 10, 2024","Apr 10, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/65650229-wellness

Now I grew up and decided to give it the hold up test. The book is the same but I am different. :) Very cheesy, too many words, and worst of all and the reason I had to abandon ship halfway through this time—it’s so racist. The skin of every non-white person is mentioned, and the only time a white person’s is mentioned it is described as olive. I thought, there you go, finally balancing out the need for a description. Then the olive skinned person started talking and had the thickest Italian accent. It’s like King lives in a world where white is a given and everyone else needs to be called out for not being normal. He uses and overuses the N word to get a point across about racist treatment. He describes the Asian person’s eyes every time he makes an appearance. It was truly ick and maddening. This was what made me stop. But I would have stopped anyway because it was predictable, good marching toward evil, and meant to be exciting but because of everything being so extreme was just boring.

I liked following the ex con sister and uncovering her story of how she came to be in prison, but the reason ended up not being dramatic or interesting enough for me. The family dynamic also added interest—the sister and her issues especially. Such a train wreck! But I could not and will never get on board with the cop/Ex-con relationship. So inappropriate and such an abuse of power that is never really addressed so it feels unrealistic. There is no way a male officer gets a pat on the wrist from the smart-seeming female parole officer for cultivating that relationship, or that the ex-con tough girl is ever okay with the inappropriate dynamic that is the relationship’s starting point. This could have been juicy if that was all the book was about, but instead they all act like this is okay and all the potential story and drama is gone. The story with the sister falls apart for me too—why would she be so dumb to be like, okay I’m going to take the fall again instead of thinking it through and being like, turn yourself in, sister, so your boss drops the charges.

I also appreciated the relationships don’t all turn out as you might expect when they are introduced. I think this author likes the idea of thinking of death as a very real part of life, but also really skimmed it in favor of setting up a light chick-lit-y book. The whole relationship with the old woman seemed unrealistic, the old woman’s family (including the son) were over the top rude and insensitive, and the main character was over the top reclusive. There is no way she’d experience so much outright rejection just for announcing her career.

I appreciated how this book talked about pandemics through time. I also liked the imagined future in outer space and with time travel. A few parts of the future pandemic felt really “insert word here” instead of imaginative—hologram rooms instead of zoom, hologram time instead of screen time for kids, etc—which made me feel like people and coping mechanisms don’t change much through time… at the same time I appreciated how the people in that future had never lived through a pandemic so they were as blindsided as we were, despite lots of pandemics through time. I found the ending a satisfying explanation and connection between the stories. I noticed the connected story between this and her last book, but that felt forced and out of place.

And does a seasoned drug dealer bow to little 16 year olds who say they are going to tell. “Oh, you’re going to tell the cops? Oh no! What can I do except throw my beer can at the wall and confess everything I know?? Please don’t tell on me little high schooler capstone project girl!!!” You are a drug dealer, man. Bust. Some. Caps. -Also, when she corners the actual murderer, like truly corners—catching him in the house with the kidnapped girl, she calls 9-1-1 and is like, “I’m going in. I have no choice.” Um…yes you do? Just say, “hey, cops. Go in there and find the girls who has been kidnapped and arrest this murderer/kidnapper/statutory rapist”?-oh, and her reason for going in was like, “I need to know. I need his confession so I can tell my friend.” [garhers confession in dangerous murderer-confronting fashion]. Texts friend. Texts??? Texts??? Like, risk your life for the info because she’s your best friend and then: Text bubble: dude, your dad is a murderer. -And then the girl who has risked her life a million times to serve justice for a year discovers the actual other murderer in sister Becca and is like, “I’m not going to turn you in. I’m warning you they might find you, murderer of humans who also murdered my dog a few days ago, and I wanted to give you a head’s up.” Ummmmm, wasn’t this whole project about serving justice? I’m glad Becca’s murder-y mind was like, here’s some 5 year old drugs that this dumb ass will drink from the tea I’ve prepared her because she is the kind of investigator who confronts murderers alone every chance she gets.I may not be any closer to knowing how to murder someone, but I sure do know all the ways to get murdered. By the end I found myself wishing that dummy would just go ahead and die. So maybe the book DID make me a murderer? But dang! Somehow this book was still good? I liked it?

I give it a 3 and encourage people to try it for the excellent depiction of adult friendship and the characters that feel like friends. It is “told in short stories,” which I usually like…but I put that in quotes because these felt more like bouncing around in time chapters—none would be a good short story by itself, and by the end I felt like I was missing important pieces of their lives. The disjointed timeline wasn’t quite disjointed enough to make it feel necessary. And I wanted sooo much more about certain glimpses of their lives that weren’t delved into—will Fiona meet her father? Isn’t that piano teacher relationship extremely inappropriate—if it were a man that would be the most creeper thing ever with long term consequences. Why does Bobby Fiona’s 2nd husband suck so much? Will Won find love? Do Fiona and Jane even need each other anymore? I think it would have been a way better story in a straight linear timeline with more of a plot.

Some were less about death and more about living, but samesies. Some were about writing, and being ed and interviewed, and being inspired. One was just about Snoopy, which was my fave because, weirdly, I ALSO was obsessed with Snoopy in my early teen years and was a little embarrassed about it until Ann told me here that only the best people have a Snoopy obsession and for very good reasons. She also got me with a whole bit about Kate Dicamillo. (Yes! Of Mercy Watson fame!) I don’t think that one would make everyone feeling seen, but that’s because they haven’t read Kate Dicamillo yet!

This collection of essays was good and full of fun science-y facts and earth-friendly pleas. The structure was cute-sy and gave the essays a bite-sized feel. However, I feel like that was the book’s demise—so many topics that he repeated and barely scraped the surface of a larger point before wrapping them up tidily and giving his 5-star scale rating. I found myself editing the book, which is never a good thing. For example, what if he combined the goose and Kentucky blue grass chapters and let the reader do some work on the deeper meanings and connections presented by these related topics?? I feel like anytime he found himself repeating some factoid, alarm bells should have went off to say, maybe this is the same story and can be used to build a point??? There were so many opportunities to combine and grow and it felt very new-to-writing-essays.

I feel like Sally Rooney wrote herself into Alice, which totally brought the character to life. Everyone else was so real. I loved how the main parts of the novel were told through action with no inner dialogue, so you had to just apply meaning like a guess to what characters were doing and why—like in life. And then the emails gave you the inner monologue to show how characters actually felt about the conversations they had and what happened to them. Then you can see why relationships are so difficult to navigate—because, even if someone is your closest and best person in the world—you still don’t know at all what life is like for them.
