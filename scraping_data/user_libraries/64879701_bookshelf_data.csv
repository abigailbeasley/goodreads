No chance that soft lad is getting to the end of his PGCE though.Absolute page turner but also as a working class northerner who loves living in London, I felt a bit defensive! London can be so accepting and chill. My friend got punched for wearing a coat on a night out in Newcastle. There are shit bits about living everywhere.
