It was quite a slow burn for me- it took me a relatively long time to read, though that was partially due to needing to pause a few times to read other books for book club deadlines. Still, this one kept drawing me back.

It is essentially one of my absolute favorite literary tropes- a grumpy, lonely older protagonist who has a coming-of-age journey through the help of their lovely, diverse, wacky community. I can probably name 5 books that I love that all follow this pattern, and I'm happy to add Albert Entwhistle to the list. It was a lovely, heartwarming journey and I adored all of his coworkers and neighbors. The only drawback (and this is truly petty and ridiculous) is that it is just SO heavily British (ya know, as it's a British book taking place in Britain written by a British author) that my stunted American English brain had to work (and Google) overtime to work out the British colloquialisms, slang, terms, and so on. This is absolutely an ""it's not you, it's me"" problem, so I'm not holding it against the book at all- it just explains why I stayed a tiny bit emotionally removed and read it a bit slower than I otherwise would've.

It is essentially a fascinating collection of anecdotes and information about the body, presented in a lighthearted and easy-to-read format. I learned a ton, though truly the bottom line of the whole book is that almost everything about the human body is still a mystery.

It was interesting, but VERY detailed and lots of long play-by-plays of different battles and skirmishes and 'sorties', and it was just...a slog. The interspersed chapters of the Soviet delegation in Washington were more interesting, but many of the chapters of life on the front were tedious. However, once I got to around 60% the story really picked up and I was finally sucked in. The final 40% was fantastic, compelling, and fast-moving. I'm utterly obsessed with Mila's friendship with Eleanor Roosevelt and have already embarked on some fascinating internet deep dives into that. Since I obviously had to pause the book around 75% and frantically read Mila's entire Wikipedia entry so that I could know what was going to happen, I really found the Author's Note at the end to add a lot- I loved hearing Quinn say where she created characters and events, and what was verbatim from Mila's own accounts.

In many ways this reminded me of “A Place for Us,” which is no small thing coming from me- that’s probably my favorite book of the last 5 years. In “The Leavers” we follow similarly complicated protagonists, experiencing a story from one perspective and then another, the second telling usually reframing what you believed from the first. We have complex immigrant stories and family relationships. Both of the main characters are layered and flawed. It was really good, and deeply thought-provoking. It doesn’t glamorize adoption or foster care, but centers the experience of the adoptee and the mother whose child was wrongfully taken from her, and it isn’t easy to read.

I loved the writing. I liked the alternating narrators. The plot was promising. But. I ultimately didn’t feel great about a white British dude writing from the perspective of a young female Nigerian refugee and her reluctant white British female “savior” (Little Bee’s cringy words, not mine). I’m not of the mindset that authors should only write characters of their own perspective and experience 100% of the time. There’s room for some nuance there, I think. But in this situation, I just didn’t care for it. I also really didn’t enjoy how blatantly he positioned Sarah as the White Savior. It was icky. Additionally, there were a lot of heavy topics covered: genocide, gang rape, suicide, immigration/refugees…and though I felt like those were generally dealt with delicately and not graphically, it was just a lot to deal with on top of everything else. And I just didn’t feel like the “resolution” was as good as maybe the author thought I should. Anyway. When I started writing this  I’d given the book 3 stars, but after writing it and reflecting further, I’m going with 2.

Jam-packed with research and academic papers, Dr. Tatum does an incredible job of explaining the phenomenon mentioned in the title, as well as many other aspects of racial development, identity, and issues.

It deserves four stars because it was so well-written and so deeply and thoroughly put me in the characters’ shoes as I read. But those were some awfully depressing, anxiety-filled shoes to walk in.

It is only fair to give some content warnings for potential readers though: postpartum depression, abortion, and the decline and loss of a parent to dementia all figure heavily into the story. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Oct 16, 2020","Oct 18, 2020","Oct 16, 2020",,Audio CD,view (with text),/book/show/48988854-truths-i-never-told-you

This was generally a good book, but I had some struggles with it. First of all, it relies SUPER heavily on the reader having a deep, intimate knowledge of the first book. Since it’s been 4ish years since I read (and adored!) The Royal We, I didn’t remember enough to follow half the storylines in this book. It was rough. A general memory of what happened did not suffice. So that kind of annoyed me throughout. It wouldn’t be a problem for someone reading the books back to back, but it was a huge problem for me. Now, murky as my memory of Book 1 may be, I seem to remember it as being a pretty lighthearted, escapist rom-com type book. This book didn’t feel that way at all. There were multiple quite heavy storylines, and with the overall length of the book, I just felt like there was a lottttt going on here. The last quarter of the book really felt like the strongest. But if I were going to try to describe all the plot lines or story arcs just in this one book, I think there could be a dozen. It was just too many.

The first 7,000 pages (25% of the book) were just inexcusably, unforgivably, torturously overwrought chapters of world building upon world building. NO. NO THANK YOU. What is happening here with all this world building, SJM? You trying to rival God and the creation story and write a book longer and more comprehensive than the Bible??! Is this like some kind of weird competition between you two? Because no one needs that much world building. Just let us live in the mystery. The next 24,000 pages of the book were interesting but- all together now- TOO LONG. Too many characters and stories and details and Randomly capitalized and Misspell’d wyrds. But I kept going because dammit, it was getting good, and I ultimately I trust SJM and her freaking world building and I knew the pain would be worth it. And the last 10,000 pages really were quite excellent. I mean, sure, it was like a month since I started reading and I’ve mostly forgotten how the world worked anyway, but it’s fine. I was invested. But also- I’m mad, because if there’s a reason I keep returning to SJM, it’s because she writes a spicy romance better than anyone. So someone please tell me why I just spent a month reading six billion pages of world building and NO SPICY ROMANCE FOR MY TROUBLES?! Are we breaking up, SJM? (Just kidding just kidding- we are never breaking up because you hold ACOTAR in your head and heart and I’ll love you forever for it.) So in conclusion, this book was longer than any book should ever be, and I’m mad about it, but also I’m gonna continue reading the next one because SOMEHOW SHE MADE IT WORTH IT, and that is why SJM is forever my queen. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jun 29, 2022","Jul 19, 2022","Sep 04, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/44793977-house-of-earth-and-blood

Gifty's experience growing up in the evangelical faith of her mother was so beautifully written, so poignant and raw and it rang very true to what I experienced myself. Her reflections on her relationships with her brother and mother, mixed with her narration of her ongoing neuroscience research, were exceptionally well done.

Both tell stories of immigrant families adapting to America, integrating and/or struggling with their faith, and touched by mental health and substance abuse issues.

It was horrifying in how close to home it hit- it was written in 1993 and takes place in 2024-2027, in a quickly-crumbling California. The slow collapse of civilization Butler imagined here was completely believable- from where I sit now in 2020, I could easily imagine this as a plausible climate-crisis-driven possibility for our not-so-distant future. It was very uncomfortable to read for that reason. There weren’t zombies or time travel or fairies or anything to distract from how very real and possible the story was. (It reminded me of Station Eleven in that way.) I enjoyed (??? Well that’s not the word for it...appreciated, maybe?) Lauren’s story and journey north. The experience of gathering her group of travelers together and making their way north was compelling and my favorite part of the book. My least favorite part was the actual discussion about Earthseed. It was just a little farfetched and cheesy to me, to imagine a teenage girl in this world creating a religion and expecting others to join her in it. I liked the actual Earthseed poetry at the beginning of the chapters though, so there’s that. My largest complaint about the book, weirdly, was the editing- or lack thereof. There were SO MANY punctuation errors- I’m not sure if it was just the edition I read or what, but random (and missing) quotation marks were evvvverywhere and suuuuper distracting. There were spelling errors, random capITalization erroRs, and just overall the whole thing needed a proofreader to give it a once over. I’m not sure how that is possible in a book so popular and published so many times!! My final complaint is that there were a lot of (not graphic, not explicit) references to children being raped. It was perhaps the casualness that they were spoken of with that was so jarring: “we passed Sue’s eight year old sister’s body, and noticed that she’d been raped. Then we heard a dog and ran to hide from it.” ....for example. But it was rough. Overall it was a compelling book, if not enjoyable. But I am curious enough to want to read the next one and hope for some happiness for the characters I’ve come to appreciate. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Sep 20, 2020","Sep 23, 2020","Feb 13, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/52397.Parable_of_the_Sower

I loooove a good multigenerational family saga and this totally delivered. I was invested in all of the characters and found them all to be relatably imperfect, flawed but lovable. Their personal and interpersonal conflicts were earned and well-explored. I thought the format (narrators and time period frequently changed and with no indications about who was narrating except the context) worked, though you have to spend the first few sentences of every new section figuring out who is talking and what year it is. I'm fine with that. I can see it annoying some people, though. :) As a whole, the book reminded me a lot of A Place for Us by Fatima Mirza, which is easily my favorite book of the last two years and it is no small compliment for me to compare anything to it. There are many similarities in format and content- both explore family relationships over several decades. I loved Lombardo's writing and felt that it perfectly fit the characters and stories in this book. It's not quite as lyrical or contemplative as A Place for Us, which some might think is a good thing, but it didn't need to be, as it also didn't explore the themes of faith and religion that were so expertly done in Mirza's book. I have altogether almost zero complaints about The Most Fun- my extremely minor quibble would be with the inaccuracy of the foster care system portrayed, from my vantage point as a foster and adoptive parent, but it was not glaring and not unbelievable enough to matter to the story. :) And not that this matters either, but I LOVED that I understood both the cover art AND title relatively early in my reading. LOVE THAT. I'm sometimes so annoyed when I'm 80% through a book and still have no idea why it's titled what it is, or what the cover art/picture is all about. So extra points and props to the author/her team for making sure I won't forget the title of this or what it looks like when I'm trying to tell someone about it in a month! In all, this book is a strong 10/10 for me- well worth the (long!) read!...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Dec 07, 2019","Dec 11, 2019","Aug 25, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/41880044-the-most-fun-we-ever-had

I did NOT care for the addition of magic or magical realism or whatever that was. The journeys to New Orleans were torturously long for me. I wanted to stop reading mannnny times, but I was genuinely curious how the author planned to pull together this many random storylines, characters, and elements. The very end (like 50 pages....out of 400+) picked up a little, but I wouldn’t say it was actually satisfying. I dunno. The beginning felt so strong, with the loss of shadows and the forgetting. I wish the story had stuck with that and the ensuing world building (or falling apart, as the case may be) and not taken the hard turn into fantasy and magic (and I’m generally a fan of magic, but here we are).

Basically this book reminded me that I know nothing about WWI. Not a thing. And therefore I struggled mightily with following the war-heavy storylines of this book- the descriptions of the front moving from here to there, and the such and such army doing this, and honestly I barely even understood/recalled the alliances between countries, much less the relationships between different ethnic groups within certain cities of ??Austria?? and ??Poland??— question marks indicating I generally didn’t even know where we were in the story. It was tough. I had to Google A LOT. BUT technical issues aside, I liked the story. The characters and situations were compelling. The writing was well done, and I loved the (sometimes grotesque) insight into medicine on the war front. Much of the book was fascinating. But then i would get so lost in the war part that it kind of put a damper on the whole experience for me. So I’m torn. I think that if someone were a WWI buff with a keen interest and knowledge of the intricacies of what was going on...I would recommend this book. But for a more casual student of history who is just looking for a compelling story- maybe pass on this one. ***After sleeping on it, I am changing my rating to three stars. Turns out that every time I see the book sitting on the table, I have a feeling of relief wash over me that I’m done with it and don’t have to read it anymore. Four star books shouldn’t make you glad to be done with them, so I’m going to have to knock it down to three. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jan 30, 2019","Feb 02, 2019","Jan 30, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/37946436-the-winter-soldier

This book is an atmospheric triumph. Eowyn Ivey’s descriptions of the wild, isolated, frigid beauty of Alaska are breathtaking. I fell in love with Mabel and Jack, with their early feelings of loss and isolation, and with their desperate desire for the snow child. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for an enthralling story- but be sure to stock up on warm blankets and a hot mug of tea before you read, as the story will certainly chill you right to the bone. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,2,"Nov 28, 2022Dec 03, 2018","Dec 02, 2022Dec 05, 2018","Dec 03, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/33597976-the-snow-child

It is beautiful, deep, moving, and heart-wrenching. An incredibly well-written book focused on characters, relationships, and questions of faith. Some of the writing felt like poetry in the best possible way. I'm not sure what genre I would put this book in, but I would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for a deep, nuanced look at family relationships. I loved the style of the book- alternating narrators sharing stories across decades of time. In another author's hands, it may have felt chaotic or disconnected, but Mirza truly wove the story together beautifully. The story about the family taking a picnic beside the river has really resonated with me in my own parenting journey and is something I will probably think about for a long time. The entire fourth section was just a masterpiece- although I struggled to read through my tears. All in all...this book was just everything I didn't know I needed. As a non-Muslim, I deeply appreciate how thoughtfully and beautifully Mirza wove the characters' faith (and struggles with faith) through the story. The faith questions the characters individually struggled with felt so familiar to me, despite our religious differences. And at the end of the book, Rafiq's realizations and revelations about mercy simply had me weeping. Five shining, glittery stars.

It was a pretty lengthy book, although the story never dragged or felt weighed down...but I still felt weirdly rushed at the very end.

But I really enjoyed learning about Nora, her family, and the neighbors on their street. I liked the glimpse into the mental lives of a rich New York family. The characters felt relatable, although their lives are nothing like mine. But their problems also felt relatable, and their problems were depressing, and so overall I just kind of feel sad after reading this book.

Overall, I found the story to be depressing, disturbing, and rather pretentious.**spoiler alert** I have really struggled with how to rate this book. Overall, I found the story to be depressing, disturbing, and rather pretentious. But there were moments of beauty- or potential for beauty- and although there were altogether WAY TOO MANY ADJECTIVES and descriptions, I still found it to be a swift, compelling read. I think that like many readers, my chief issue is with the way Turtle’s repeated sexual assaults by her father are portrayed. The languages used was far too sympathetic. I understand that Turtle was confused, conflicted, and had some Stockholm syndrome going on, but I felt that the repeated insensitivity of language and gratuitous and graphic violence very much detracted from the overall book. After the first few chapters- okay, we get it. Martin is a sadistic pedophile. If you need to allude to the continuing assaults, fine, but we can stop reading about her “engorged pussy” already. Same with the gun stuff. We get it. There are a ton of guns, Turtle is a genius at shooting, she cleans them all the time, Martin has weird obsessions with shooting practice, whatever. Enough ten-page play-by-plays of that. I found Turtle’s fascination/relationship with Jake and Brett to be the more compelling part of the story, as well as her eventually trying to figure a way out (and then with Cayenne as well) and wish we could have had more of that and less guns and rape. And I very much wish we could have had more story devoted to “after”...seeing Turtle learn to integrate into normal society would have been a more compelling story than another encounter with her father. Overall, I’m torn because I do think there were some interesting aspects of the story that I’d love to discuss with my book club, but I would never actually recommend that any of them read the book because it just wasn’t worth the disturbing parts. 2.5 stars, but I round down for how irritated I was by the romanticized portrayal of rape. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jan 26, 2018","Jan 28, 2018","Jan 26, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/34675020-my-absolute-darling
