'They exist to make us feel. To connect us to what's inside, sometimes to things we don't even know are there. It only makes sense that some of what we feel when we're reading...would rub off'"" (8).""Like humans, books experienced their share of heartache—and like humans, they remembered"" (9).""Without a reader, a book was a blank slate, an object with no breath or pulse of its own. But once a book became part of someone's world, it came to life, with a past and present—and, if properly cared for, a future"" (10).""Where is human nature so weak as in a bookstore?"" (15).""There was something enormously rewarding about taking something that had been neglected, even mistreated, and making it new again, deconstructing it with the greatest of care, then putting it back together again, its spine straightened, its scars removed, its tired beauty restored"" (19).""'You have been the capital error of my life, the one regret for which there can be no absolution, no peace'"" (23).""'Women aren't usually consulted on wars. We send our husbands and brothers and sweethearts to do the dying, hold the pieces together while they're gone, then pick up what's left when they come home—if they come home—but we're seldom asked what we think'"" (47).""'We read not to escape life but to learn how to live it more deeply and richly, to experience the world through the eyes of the other'"" (55).""He said all good writing—fiction or nonfiction—has a heartbeat, a life force that comes from the writer, like an invisible cord connecting them to the reader. Without it, the work is dead on arrival"" (104).""Books may be likened to the people who come into our lives. Some will become precious to us; others will be set aside. The key is to discern which is which"" (141).

I was scared to purchase this novel, if only because the s seem so conflicted and the blurb doesn't effectively capture what actually happens in the novel. the one star s don't have any real issue with the book except that everyone doesn't always act like a villain. however, there's a lot of moral ambiguity through the novel which really made it for me. alliances are created and destroyed, and enemies and friends seem no different. the relationships in the novel are so complex, and the personalities created so beautifully, that we don't know which person to root for. I don't agree with the idea that this book is not worth reading these people don't act villainous. i think it's unfair to expect characters to be truly villainous without any regret. that would make this quite the boring book. the inner conflict is what makes these people real, proving that they have their humanity. i think being villainous is the moral ambiguity of the so called villain. i also think that these families are villainous. the entire premise of the novel is that these families kill each other for power. i feel like that's quite villainous.""He was a dagger in the darkness, quiet blood spilled on nightclothes, a scream that died in your throat"" (159)....more",Notes are private!,4,1,1,"Sep 30, 2023","Oct 06, 2023","Jul 20, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56179338-all-of-us-villains

I am STUNNED because i have not a clue how she manages to build such elaborate worlds. everything is so well thought out, the characters complex, the plot complex, EVERYTHING is so intricate. i just love the romance in here, and that it could exist without the romance and still be a wonderful book. i find myself lately shying away from romance, and this book delivered the high quality fantasy i needed while giving me the tidbits of romance i love looking for. there are a lot of complaints about the information dump but honestly, i love learning about the magical world. isn't one of the best parts of fantasy the magic and the transport to a different universe? why would i choose a novel that gave me less details and less back pain from carrying it around?please read this my fellow fantasy lovers. once you're done reading the 2000 other novels i've recommended.
