It literally consumed me for three straight days as I tore through it. It tells a story from the perspective of a self splintered by trauma. The gods/spirits/deities that have taken hold to protect a young woman speak directly to us, the reader, and it’s simply mesmerizing.

Many things are better than a complete remembering; many things we do are a mercy.” I watched a clip of the author on The Daily Show, and am fascinated by her. She has such depth running through her.

Of course I had to send my “buddy” reader a picture of the Frilled Shark, yikes! So something goes wrong on the submarine and a short mission turns into six months stuck at the bottom of the sea. The crew loses all communication not knowing if they will ever surface again. We know from the beginning that one of the main characters does survive, but something is terribly wrong with her! The originality of this story is off the charts! I loved how it drew me in from the start and gave me two different perspectives. One from the woman who survived the ordeal and the other from her wife who knows something is terribly wrong. And man oh man do things get weird. So weird that that even when things go a little beyond believable I had no problem going with it. The writing is full of metaphor and it added to the experience though at times it was over the top.

It makes the statement that politics will not be found here, then spends a lot of time discussing them. Honestly, the only section I found interesting was the music section and a little of the politics.I thought it would be fun to try a little tip back through the 80's, but this book needs a lot of work.Thanks to NetGalley for the advanced copy....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Aug 11, 2022","Sep 27, 2022","Aug 11, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60134493-1980

I’d never really given it much thought when a new friend said she had spent twenty five years there.She’s one of those who takes on any physical challenge, and now I get it. Alaska is rugged and demanding. This read was superb at describing not only the physical toll, but also the emotional one with a few hours of light during the winters, and never ending days during the summer. The story centers around a girl and her family. Her father has never been the same since returning from Vietnam. Her mother can’t forget what he was like before, clings to it, despite physical and emotional abuse. Surly Alaska will provide the escape he needs. I won’t give anything away, but it gets very dark, and not the lack of light kind!The second half...hello Hallmark! Really? Why oh why. It turned into a love story. Not that I mind those, just really? After such a great first half I just didn’t like where Hannah took the ending.

This made my all time favorites list!I never would have thought with a title of “Two Boys Kissing,” and a not so great cover, I would have loved this book so much. Also, I get a little perturbed when it’s always boys and not girls. But, this this is so universal it didn’t matter.Levithan centers his novel around a true event, two boys kissing to break a world record. But, my oh my, the narrators are the previous generation of gay men, looking down with support, understanding, and even resentment.I loved this early quote...“We were once the ones living and then we were the ones dying. We sewed outfits, a thread’s width into your history. We were once like you, only our world wasn’t like yours. You have no idea how close to death you came. A generation or two earlier, you might be here with us. We resent you. You astonish us.”And, just OMG with the characters. Two boys meet at a gay prom (not in my day!) Two others are trying to negotiate a relationship, another has been assaulted, and one appears damaged beyond repair by his parents lack of acceptance. While this may be a YA book, the writing was phenomenal!Personally I could relate to so many of the characters struggles as many of my own were painful. So yes, this book made me cry, but also filled me with hope. While this is about the gay experience, it also reminded me about the struggles of immigrants, Native Americans, African Americans, etc. That’s why I found this book to be so universal. It was also a great reminder of the price paid by countless others who came before to ease the way.

Just the other day I was driving in the mountains, noticing a blue truck was constantly behind me. He even made the same turn I did on a dirt road. Was he coming to kill me? How will I escape? Oh, he just passed me, whew! Yup, this is gonna stick with me, just hopefully not too long.

It pulled me in immediately, and not only was it difficult to put down, but when I had to, all I wanted was to get back to it. When I finished, I thought, was this a novella? Nope, I just wanted more!This is not a grim story, but still brought to life the tragedy of 9-11. It captured brilliantly how one moment can change what we value, and radically shift our perceptions. Polisner writes:""So now I get it. Now I fully understand. Tuesday and those planes, they've broken something. Permanently. And in the process, they've changed everything. And everyone.""The writing here is smart, gripping, and totally engaging. I felt like I was in a bubble of time. A time when the world came together, when even a coming-of-age story fit perfectly within it. The tragedy experienced by so many was not the main focus here, yet it could be felt underlying every page. I look at our world is now and think, does it really take such a catastrophic event to bring us together again? There is such goodness that lies at the heart of most of us. And as the author states in the epilogue, ""This is a story of hope."" And this is exactly what I was left with, hope.Highly recommended!...more",Notes are private!,0,37,1,"Aug 09, 2016","Aug 11, 2016","Aug 09, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28220960-the-memory-of-things

It is my favorite read so far this year, and spoke to me like few books do.It's the 80's and McDaniel startHoly moly, this is McDaniel's debut novel? It is my favorite read so far this year, and spoke to me like few books do.It's the 80's and McDaniel starts by reminding us of the hysteria over child abuse at the time. I remember the McMartain trial, the social workers giving children toy dolls, asking leading questions, dooming innocent caretakers as pedophiles. It was also the decade we learned of AIDS, how many believed God was exacting judgement for those who defiled Him. These memories set the stage for her own novel by showing us how hysteria and religious fervor are often all too human, but always lead us down a path of destruction.We are introduced to the Bliss family, and their two sons Feilding and Grand. The younger son Feilding, now 84 years old, narrates the story as he looks back to his 13th year, and a summer that changed everything. His father was the town prosecutor. Always an even-handed man, he begins to wonder, is he really sifting out the ""devils,"" or merely playing god. His desire to know leads him to place an add in the paper, inviting the devil to town. When the devil shows up as a 13 year old boy, and the town is facing its hottest summer on record, tempers begin to flare.I loved how McDaniel took on all the questions that lie at the heart of who we are, and what we believe in. Questions such as where does our sense of morality, good and evil, right, and wrong, come from. This isn't a book questioning the existence of God or the devil, but rather how humans have interpreted both. She carefully weaves throughout many emotions and topics, such as pain and suffering, loss and death, family bonds and homosexuality.What lies at the heart of this novel is mob mentality, how families are shattered through their ignorance, and how one man can affect others to blindly follow him through fear. As McDaniels states, ""It is the inability to choose by our own will that lessens us all. It is disease to our sanity, which  sickens our good sense until we are the victims of choices we would not normally have been in  the company of."" I was so reminded of our current political situation, and loved this statement as well, ""Fear is ignorance's first shadow""McDaniel's writing is full of metaphor, and so beautifully written. Even the characters names were brilliant, ones I will never forget. Sometimes it takes a so-called devil to help us see more clearly. I think the novel seeks to show us that love is the only answer that matters in the end.

Wow, did I ever pick the wrong book to start with.The story revolves around the main character Georgia. She's discovered her first love has died, and remembers she never told him she loved him. She decides to try and contact each former love.""I've decided I'm going to look up all the men I've loved just to let them know I'm glad I had the opportunity to know and love them and just to see if they're alive and well.""Okay, so cute plot, but the story meandered about with lots of Georgia's friends becoming involved, and the main focus veering to that of finding a man. Georgia is also in her 50's, sick of her job, and believes the best part of her life is behind her. So this finding a man thing seems to be her only recourse. Really?The writing was just okay, and I had really had enough of all the ""miss thang,"" and ""you hussy"" between friends. I hate to say it, but this is chick-lit at its finest.

GrahaWhile I appreciate a memoir on addiction that shows it can target anyone, regardless of class or social standing, this one didn't fully grab me. Graham is a photographer, Susan a journalist. Susan has left their relationship due to Graham's using, but re-enters his life years later when she discovers he is in serious trouble. Her decision to help against all odds is the focus of this book.The events are told in alternating voices between Graham and Susan, but often felt as if one person was doing the telling for both. Maybe this is due to Susan's profession, but I just didn't feel the anguish in Graham's voice. While I was all for Susan coming to Graham's aid, there was just something I couldn't wrap my brain around. With all her ideas to fix Graham, did she never once research what addiction is? She believes Graham needs to look at his childhood traumas, or unresolved ""causes"" leading to addiction. Unfortunately addiction is a disease, not a moral issue, or something caused by childhood trauma. I know I've done a little ranting, but all in all, this is not a bad read. The idea to help an addict is one that many think is pointless, yet there are so many who want help and find it unavailable. How many could be saved if not only people, but our government gave a shit. This sure gave me a hard look at the U.S. Justice system, and for that alone this one is well worth the read.

What ensues is a character study of the adult members of the plane. I didn't really mind this, but felt the thrill fading. A lot of interesting questions were asked in regard to hero worship and how society expects one to act in such situations. It became a big focus of this book, almost more than discovering what happened to bring down the plane. It seemed the story didn't know where to go after this, leading to an anticlamitic ending.

These stories are deep, often dark, and disturbing. And yet they go to the very core of what some women suffer in their relations with men. Some of the stories connect, while others do not. I've actually started a second reading, as the powerful messages they impart were easy for me to miss when I wasn't sure if they were connecting to another story. The first story centers around a quarry, as do a few others. And as Noyes states they are ""deep, murky, a lot of junk down there."" This is central to the stories. What women have buried below their surfaces. These stories gave me pause, to think about how men have defined the world. How women have always known deep down how unjust this was but stay on the surface and hope for safety. These stories remind of the dangers of men, the uncertainty of women. ( I mean no disrespect to men here, as I know many who champion us.) How child abuse can warp a woman's understanding of love. I wondered, where does this need come from to be with a man who abuses, and how need can so consume a woman it is all she can see.I often think just how far women have come in one generation, yet our past is still with us. I wonder if our current ""rape culture"" is a backlash against just how far we have come, as we are slowly unearthing ""a lot of junk down there.""

I knew what was happening as I pulled on the root, seeing the main taproot, the one my tree had grown straight down and spent it's lifetime trying to maintain. Then came the side roots, the ones put out for stability, called runners. My tree had suckers, green shoots coming from the runners, still living, still choosing life, even though its main source had died. Taking down that tree of mine was an emotional experience. I'll never look at a tree the same way after reading this book. Hope Jahren is truly gifted. Her memoir was fantastic! I loved how she explained the science of paleobiology in easy to understand terminology, some of which, as a geologist myself, I had never fully understood. But, this book is so much more! It's her story. Of being a woman in a mans world, of her long term relationship with her assistant Bill. She is always in the pursuit of knowledge, and their travels take them all over the world. Always on a shoestring budget, these travels are adventurous, and downright daring. They had me laughing and at times crying. Our destruction of our planet is truly heartbreaking, but Jahren does not lecture or make this the main focus. One of the things she asks us readers is to plant a tree of our own. My dead tree will be replaced, and knowing what I do now, I'm pretty darn excited about the whole process!To quote another Goodreads er (yes you Cynthia) the women are on a roll this year! ...more",Notes are private!,0,221,1,not set,"May 11, 2016","May 06, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25733983-lab-girl

The one that really got me, and I felt drove the novel, was the role of a caretaker. Through personal experience, I can say the focus is always on the person who is sick. Hooper takes this on with gusto. She explores the sacrifices and emotions of those who are expected to care for loved ones. How much does one give up of their own life? How do we define boundaries in such situations? I was completely enthralled with how the main character handled questions such as these. Finding myself asking, what would I do?Don't think for a minute this is all the novel explores. Holy moly, there is so much more. The choices we make, the consequences that follow.

It did draw me in at the beginning, but then kept me at a distance from the characters. In the story, a fathers mental illness is passed to one of the sons, and is told through his eyes. While this gave me an inside look at the thoughts and actions of one with such an illness, it also distanced me from the deeper emotions of the family. I was left with a feeling of this is what happened. For me, I really missed not having a more personal connection to the story. I did absolutely love Haslett's writing though.

Alexandra Fuller took me on an amazing journey through her younger years growing up in Africa as a poor white girl. Her parentsWhat a fantastic read! Alexandra Fuller took me on an amazing journey through her younger years growing up in Africa as a poor white girl. Her parents are expats from Britain who moved in the late 60's to work as farm managers. This memoir details her life from that time right up to the late 90's, a time period when Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) was at war fighting for independence from Britain. I found it fascinating to not only read of the hellish conditions, but also how this young girl named Bobo, deals with so many challenges. She brought me right into her world, one more concerned with family, and her daily life. Only a child can see the humor in situations that would scare the crap out of me. So this was not a somber read at all. As a kid, you have no idea your parents are racist, so it can be uncomfortable to read of this families ideas of blacks, but also deeply informing. Truly, this memoir has it all, a family on the wrong side of history, a mothers mental health issues, constant loss, death, relocating, and a vivid picture of the land. The descriptions of the land were so dynamic and realistic I will never forget them. I became a part of this book, such a rare feeling!...more",Notes are private!,0,40,1,"Apr 07, 2016","Jun 08, 2016","Apr 06, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/24687.Don_t_Let_s_Go_to_the_Dogs_Tonight

I need edgy.The alternating stories of present day Izzy, who's mother sits in jail for killing her father, and Clara, committed to an insane asylum in 1929 tied the two together in unexpected ways. Izzy is struggling with the possibility that her own mother was insane, among other things. Clara, who was only 18, was committed by her parents for falling in love with an ""inappropriate"" man.It was appalling to read of Clara's story. How dreadful and hideous conditions of insane asylums were at the time, with women having little recourse against men. My only complaint is that this felt a little 'lite,' with everything tying up too neatly.

It's loosely based on the Charles Manson cult and how 13 year old Evie Boyde is drawn into their world. Evie is living in a dysfunctional family, wanting out, when she is drawn to the ""coolness"" of a girl she sees from afar. It reminded me of myself at that age. How easy it is to be attracted to another world when one is unhappy with their own.I loved that this book didn't focus on the murders, but rather the relationships formed between the girls. Cline did an excellent job of creating believable characters, with a true sense of time and place. For me, it brought back the eerie feelings I felt as a young girl myself, living hours away. Cults were seen as all about love, peace, and living off the land. How did it all go so wrong? This book gave incredible insight into how easily things can spiral out of control.
