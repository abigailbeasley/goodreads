I enjoyed hearing the perspective of someone who is so deeply invested in self-betterment and actualization. To Elrod, mediocrity is the ultimate fear. However, I cannot help but wonder what the opposing perspective is. Is there a healthy medium? One that sees and pursues potential yet also finds beauty in how things are — beauty in the ordinary/mediocre. Maybe I’ll figure that out during the meditation portion of my Miracle Morning. Ha!

A novel that is about writing a novel is that way I suppose. In one scene, she is describing why she loves reading and writing. That some stories simply must be told! And the sheer wonder at the skill it takes to envelop someone in a world you created. The story itself (not just the writing, if that makes sense) made me appreciate the book so much more. There’s a passage where she describes how we often read books, and then ask questions that pull us out of the story. She asks how can we ask questions that push us further in “so they can feel everything the author tried so hard to create for them.” I often say I love reading books that teach me just as much about my own life as the life of the characters. But reading this made me stop and wonder if some books are meant to be read simply to know the characters and the world the author created more deeply. Overall, I really enjoyed this book.

Wishing it wasn’t a library book so I could underline it and re-read it. It’s strange to read a book where basically nothing happens, the characters are somewhat insufferable, and there is not much development. Yet I absolutely loved it? I enjoyed how Rooney seemingly used this book to share her own thoughts on various aspects of this big beautiful world we live in, particularly her thoughts on Christianity. The ways the characters were fascinated by and loved the person of Jesus while not believing in him was just really interesting to me. You could see the character of God just peeking into their lives. Overall, it was just so good. Rooney does a magical job of keeping me interested even when I expect them to not give me what I want plot-wise. Talent!!!!!!!!
