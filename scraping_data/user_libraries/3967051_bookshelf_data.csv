But thisA good graphic novel on a fraught topic that has lived for decades, the fate of Jewish-owned properties lost in World War II, here in Warsaw. But this is also a narrative of the present, about resolving the unfinished parts of long lives and transmitting the continuous truths that history covers over. I find that graphic novels do not handle the subtle experiences of memory very well, and do not easily communicate a reflective or conflicted state of mind. That was apparent here; but it is a book that speaks responsibly and thoughtfully to the present.

Our protagonist, Michael Hendricks, was prepared for this ruthless life by a parentless childhood in group homes and extensive special ops practice in Afghanistan. He emerges from an IED explosion and crawls away, but is listed as dead by the army. This permits a super heroic invisibility for this natural killer, but it also lays a heavy burden of survivor's guilt on his shoulders. He allows his beloved girl to believe him dead, while he seeks expiation by nurturing his deserted soul. It's a well-conceived but implausible premise, made compelling by rapid and well-characterized choices and situations.

At one point late in the book, a bad cop holds a gun on him and says, ""Retired and relentless are two things that don't mesh together very well."" In the realm of the police procedural narrative, Harry is a relentless proceduralist, a man who knows investigative technique, the weight of meticulous documentation, and the value of constantly returning to the text, in this case a police murder book. But without direct access to the case, the forensics, and the steady interaction with a provocative partner, Harry is at risk of missing the connections he rightly understands to be embedded in the evidence. So, reluctantly working as a private investigator for his half-brother Mickey Haller, Harry seethes with impatience and lost identity. He bends the truth and presents himself as a semi-legitimate cop. He hides from most of his former colleagues. He knows that working for a defendant betrays decades of working for the other side; and yet, because Harry serves justice before anything else -- everybody matters or nobody matters -- he accedes to his circumstances and proceeds. I think we must foresee a future for Harry in private work, and hope that he continues with the independent life it will provide.

When we read a novel like this one -- coupled as it is to riveting and saddening news of forced emigration and brutal response -- some of that is undone. We gather some small idea of the complexity of displaced lives through the author's authority. Vu Tranh, born in Vietnam and raised in Oklahoma, certainly has a full view of what is too often hidden. The form he has chosen for this telling is somewhat flawed, but the underlying narratives ring true.The book seems to be about crime, but then it seems to be about love, and sometimes it seems to be about rescue. But it isn't about any of these. The protagonist is a policeman, but not a very smart or appealing one. His opponents are shady Vietnamese gamblers and heavy-handed minor gangsters. And the object of his attention is the Vietnamese woman he has lost to a stereotypical, patriarchal semi-mobster. She is a problem without limits, erratic, opaque, haunted, inscrutable (sorry to suggest a stereotype), and seemingly without reality. We never meet her, but she is everywhere in the Las Vegas wind. We sense that she is living with ghosts.What we do know about her, however, comes to us through lengthy and uninvolving diary entries that chronicle her escape from Vietnam, the death of her first husband, an alliance with a fellow escapee (the brutal gambler she turns to ultimately), and her unexpected daughter Mai, for whom the diary is intended. Consequently (though her life is desperate) she remains merely a fiction within a fiction to the reader, not a person we can grasp through dialogue, interaction, or a semblance of living emotion. We know she is not a very predictable person, that her marriage to the policeman was largely enigmatic and incompatible, and we know that she left him with a sense of having failed to save her from herself. Still, it is difficult to care.This novel seems like a crime novel, but it fails to do what fine crime literature does: we have no way to see beyond the situation to some sort of coherent resolution that satisfies and informs. While the author has much honest experience to work with, the diaries are not illuminating to read because they distract the reader even farther from the currently absent wife. To be fair, they chronicle authentic desperation, disappearances, and threats to existence, and in them the duress, isolation, haunting, and despair of immigrant lives are made fairly clear. (And so, three stars.) Yet the hidden psychological experience many people do not wish to see remains intact. The author might have told a less opaque and more moving story had the woman at its center been given an actual presence, and a real voice, in the novel. As it is, she becomes to us merely a ghost of herself....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Sep 07, 2015","Sep 18, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23316485-dragonfish

The depth and rigor of Rash's writing, his diction particularly, is inspiring and immersing. This is an occasion a reader hopes to experience: when your first thought after closing the book is a question about how this was done, what knowledge came into play, how historical knowledge had to be met with imaginative contexts, and how deliberatively written this book is. One answer is to find a model in Shakespeare, and follow its chilling inevitabilities. Another reason is to strike some bargain permitting you to write with certainty of inner lives, and, if needed, to imagine all the possibilities of amorality and follow them. Never having read Rash before, I regret it has taken me so long. Now, too late, I know I would have enjoyed leading a conversation about Serena with Carolina voices in the group.

Sustaining an invented narrative over a long passageFirst novels almost always deserve basic praise for the audacity of the challenge they represent. Sustaining an invented narrative over a long passage of time and complexity is difficult, and to undertake the attempt is bold, and occasionally arrogant. The arrogant writers are easy to address by saying nothing. And for some others, real writing skill and imaginative talent can emerge only after an initial attempt. The great first novel is rare, and yet here is an example of exactly that rarity, in a relatively brief but clearly satisfying form.S. M. Hulse manages at least five strong narrative strands in Black River and any one of them is daunting: a devastating loss, conflict with a son, lasting wounds and inner scars, dealing with crippling bitter memories, and what music means to a man who has lost it. Other themes adroitly play a part in the unrolling of the story. But these five are enough to doom any novel without an artist in control. At its center is Wes Carver -- prison guard, musician, widower, stepfather, mourner -- as he experiences a fraught, angry return to the source of his bitterness. The rawness and depth of anger he shows is not far beneath everyday conversation and it is close to a generalized hatred. It always underlies memory and dialogue, and it stands fully in the way of arriving at a settled heart. Of course none of the losses can be erased or undone; it is his unyielding and grievous intensity that makes Wes the wreckage he is. Hulse is deeply impressive for managing the multiple strands, blending them artfully while introducing contexts, characters and attitudes that nearly match Wes in implacability and obduracy. He is a hardened man outwardly, but as the history of his feelings is told, he is fully exposed in a way I would expect to challenge an experienced master novelist. And more: Hulse is a powerful stylist and graceful narrator, undaunted by the complexity of good and evil in human forms. Black River also does great justice to Montana, not merely as an astonishing landscape, but as the bare place of hard endless winters that both forge and prove personal character. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Aug 22, 2015","Aug 09, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/20256635-black-river

This is a strenuous novel, written as much by muscle as by intellect, to be read with expectations of exhaustion from the acts of construction it requires. Set in both Britain and Australia, neither place holds comfort or respite for Jake, the woman at its center. Isolated from her rough origins, bullied and sexually abused, she is a woman strong enough to wrestle a sheep for shearing but unable to feel much at the center of her life. She seems permanently unsafe, a woman who cannot draw a comforting breath. Sheep and dogs are active players in the narrative; the heavy weather of Britain is fierce; and the unidentified murderous creature killing Jake's sheep seems almost to be a terrifying part of her self. Jake's history and character are revealed without sequence or certainty, so a reader constructs these things fitfully, compelled by the work at hand. Like one of my awkward stone walls, this fine novel could be remade in multiple ways and still remain perpetually unfinished and challenging....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Aug 04, 2015","Aug 05, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18142324-all-the-birds-singing

(Keep Faulkner and Melville, and Whitman and Twain, geniuses all. But farewell to Hawthorne and Salinger. Let's add Agee, McCullers, and John Williams, to refresh the canon as well. Revive Willa Cather and Eudora Welty. There are more writers, and many individual works. Does anyone still read The Grapes of Wrath? Reading Marilynne Robinson made me think of that great book about work and struggle.)To expand the list in this way would recognize the deep veins of authentic faith and generosity, the kindness that is also strength, the dreaming and anticipating, that characterize an American experience and voice. We have rugged heroism, social striving, and self-destruction throughout American fiction. We have moral judgments, class and race wars, and destructive bitterness. What we need is human beings speaking to each other in words that describe the urgencies and surprises and the hidden intimate gifts in American experience. We need an understanding of the differences within differences remaining untold.What I admire about Lila and its predecessors (Gilead and Home) is the deliberate exposition of ambiguities and constraints of living in a wide landscape where homely rituals, the sustenance of relationships, the discoveries of possibilities, and subtle human changes -- all of them -- tell us that a tentative embrace of each other is possible, probably essential. We are contrasts to each other, even as we are siblings to each other. The varieties of experience and hope in our nation is still largely untold, in my view, and there are writers needed to tell about them.

Nora Webster has seen her husband, Maurice, a respected teacher, die. He leaves Nora and four children, two of whom are not yet in their teens. The family is not lost, but we worry for it, seeing how it has been rocked. Nora is also not lost, but takes time to find the firm self that had disappeared into the construction of a sound marriage. She now has something else to construct for herself and her children. Her tentative steps and second thoughts remind us of where she is: in an Irish community of people who care, but who also judge, suspect, and conspire. For a widow, all change is subject to  and inspection; comments are made. People intrude. Nora lives as though she is in performance before the small-minded audience seated in a narrow theater. Remember, also, this is Ireland, and a civil war is going on.As I felt while reading Tóibín's Brooklyn, he gives us a life so private that it would have disappeared without him, except that, as he writes it, its owner becomes someone new. Enduring the loss of Maurice, Nora is at first tangential, conditional (a widow), and what she had thought permanent is suddenly temporary. It is not so much the loss of the life that matters; it is the loss of the resonance and trust she had known in marriage. Our impermanence, suddenly demonstrated, raises doubts; our doubts raise questions that assail us, holding them up to the light. Our work is to rescue ourselves, or the expectations of loss will be fulfilled. Late in the novel, Nora's self-rescue involves music. Gazing at the record jacket, she listens to a recording of a young woman playing the cello (I presume it is Jacqueline du Pré) with other musicians.""What she had told no one, because it was too strange, was how much this music had come to stand for. It was her dream-life, a life she might have had if she had been born elsewhere. She allowed herself to live for a time each day in a pure fantasy in which she could have learned the cello as a child and then been photographed as this young woman was, eager and talented and in full possession of her world, with men beside her who depended on her to come in with her deeper, darker sound. ... She wondered if she was alone in having nothing in between the dullness of her own days and the sheer brilliance of this imagined life.""...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Mar 22, 2015","Mar 23, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/21412360-nora-webster

I am always looking for the sign until I have fallen over the edge; when I do, it moves me faster into the world beyond the edge. Here are the sentences from page ten of TransAtlantic that confirmed this compelling dive for me. ""When they met for the first time in the Vickers [airplane] factory in Brooklands, in early 1919, Alcock and Brown took one look at each other and it was immediately understood that they both needed a clean slate. The obliteration of memory. The creation of a new moment, raw dynamic, warless. It was as if they wanted to take their older bodies and put their younger hearts inside. They didn't want to remember the bombs that had dudded out, or the crash or burn, or the cellblocks they had been locked into, or what species of abyss they had seen in the dark.""""It was as if they wanted to take their older bodies and put their younger hearts inside."" Alcock and Brown, ruined by World War I, are about to fly the Atlantic in the first of the several interlocked, historical and yet contemporary, chapters of the novel. Immediately after the first chapter, the human rights advocate Frederick Douglass, on his journey to the British Isles is the historical center of the story. Its somewhat more human and less visible center emerges: a young servant woman he meets and inspires. She and her descendants live throughout the book, including on the airfield of the first pages. Her life lives on through them, and through the lives she has touched, into this century. Of nearly every character we see, the younger, yearning heart is present amid the losses and inconsequence of a life.I did not think it possible, but my admiration for TransAtlantic exceeds even my admiration for Let the Great World Spin, a book that gave me wonder as well. But I need to stop writing this , or I will be unable to stop writing this . Here is the epigraph for TransAtlantic, from Eduardo Galleano, the perfect prelude to this experience: ""No history is mute. No matter how much they own it, break it, and lie about it, human history refuses to shut its mouth. Despite deafness and ignorance, the time that was continues to tick inside the time that is."" ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Nov 25, 2014","Nov 30, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16085517-transatlantic

It is the calm voice of Bosch that was a revelation to me: Connelly writes detailed police procedural narratives telling reasons for specific practices, and it took the necessity of hearing those close passages for me to understand how vital and intelligent they are to reading this great series. Harry is within a year of ending his career with the department, still working in cold cases, but with a new, courageous and highly motivated partner who is both appealing and promising. Harry is a great mentor, always living as he does with the moral burden that becomes an explicit part of this case: ""everybody matters, or nobody matters.""

The protagonist, Jason Stafford, once a superman of Wall Street, did prison time for his shortcuts. The time away was good for him, ethically and morally. But his personal life fell to pieces, including losing his young son's custody to his mother, a shallow Louisiana beauty who seemed like a good idea when the money was rolling in. The boy is on the autism spectrum, and one of the satisfactions of the novel is how modestly and humbly the protagonist, with the help of a school and a caregiver, enters and acts in the Kid's private world. No grand breakthrough, but slow insight and great respect for the boy matter. The pursuit of a scam in a financial house requires intimate knowledge of how money works; it seems to have the ring of possibility here, though its clarity is often obscured by the greed and emptiness of it all. In his return to that vulgar working world, Stafford's ethics, logics, and behaviors in this book are appealing to me, in a story that is well told....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Nov 24, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13593566-black-fridays

At that time, I was under the literary influence of Jim Corbett (Man-Eaters of Kumaon, about crazed tigers killing villagers). Therefore I chose to write my greatest story about a wild elephant (since Corbett had written about tigers, and I did not want to appear to be too derivative), who of course went mad with elephant madness and stamped on villagers. Because the story was so clearly perfect, I never felt the need to write another. My fellow short story writers probably understand this: Why improve on self-evident perfection?This brings me to William Trevor. How do writers continue to write in the presence of such mastery? As with the work of his peer, Alice Munro, these stories are evidence of a version of second sight, a penetrating gaze that peels away shallow convention to describe our common depths. It is as though by describing lives and houses and laundry and memories, he makes them transparent to us, however opaque they remain in the lived experiences of those who occupy them. I would read Trevor every day and feel it was the equivalent of medicine chosen to induce humility and gratitude. I find this as well in Raymond Carver's work, there is no great or grave secret that is not lived or living in the people on the street or in the subway.We who would write yet fail will know it: in these short spaces, rough stones are shaped to human forms and delicate truths. ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"Oct 23, 2014","Oct 28, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/493323.After_Rain

Phil Klay's Redeployment is one recent part of the long series of books that carry the most lasting narrative legacies of what we have done to each other with weapons since 1914. The current spate of fresh perspectives on the Battle of the Somme and its sequels reminds any sentient reader of what men and women have endured for decades during and following warfare. The stories here are bitter, cruel, and perfect vessels for the veil of doubt that will hover over the history of soldiering since the watershed of days in 2011. Klay inhabits multiple key actors in these stories -- a military chaplain, a body-gatherer, a burn survivor in a Manhattan bar, for example -- and as he does, the reader thinks: no doubt, no doubt. The idiocy of generals pervades our ideas of the First War and the heroic fight against the perverse Nazi state pervades our narratives of the Second, but beginning with Korea and then Vietnam, and now in the Middle East, we have no comforting nobility to succor us. So here we have a fine work that typifies the lifetime of ambiguous warfare since 1945: the engagement with truth-telling, pervasive ambivalence, impotent anger, bombed out feelings, paranoid hatred and fear, abrasive details of needless death, the murder of families, cruel jokes, addiction to killing, unanswerable questions. On all of these counts, the stories in Redeployment, experiences of Iraq warfare and its aftermath, will serve the human record as long as people read.

I suggest that a reader is best prepared for reading it by ignoring summaries and discussions of plot lines.

For a reader of a great work, the machinery and effects are tacit: the great book is words that make its reader wordless. As I read All the Light We Cannot See it seemed unnecessary to describe the experience to myself. It was, in a phrase I admire from Maxine Greene, a lived experience. The author Doerr is really a character here, I think: he is the locksmith at the Museum of Natural History in Paris whose sightless daughter is one of the two centers of the book. The other is a German orphan, an intuitive technologist whose life takes on dimensions through radio transmissions, first as a child and then as a very young German soldier charged with finding the secret transmitters of the French Resistance. He has heard the voice of the daughter in a broadcast, and he is haunted by it, as he is by knowing the deaths he has brought about. The locksmith's daughter is, like the reader, capable of visualizing through senses other than sight. Like her, we are given a model city to touch with our fingertips, while keys open locks, tumblers mesh and secured doors swing open, each one holding some small unclear glimpse of what is to happen. This too is a sign of great fiction: we are given glimpses and fragments in short chapters. So much about this large fiction is small, a miniature of the world in chaos. The true magic of wonderful fiction is that our view of small lives becomes microcosmic, illuminating some larger lost universe we did not know we were reading about....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Oct 29, 2014","Aug 18, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18143977-all-the-light-we-cannot-see

Then I fell into this book and found it to take me back to some of the best reading I did forty years ago or more. At times Doerr reminded me of the Nabokov of Pnin or the great Bernard Malamud's A New Life; I also thought of Saul Bellow and the neglected Edward Lewis Wallant. Doerr's protagonist is haunted and driven, hopeful and enduring, hopeless and fragile. He starts out in Anchorage, runs with his lover to Cleveland (where Grace is born). His prescient dreaming sets him into a frenzy of protective madness. He loses his marriage and child, his job as a weatherman, but not the haunted life he has led. All of this is strangely credible, as it must be, to serve as the foundation for what follows, an attempt to live a life apart from all of its foundations. He is a hydrologist by training -- a specialist in snowflakes -- and scholarly disquisitions about moisture are embedded in the narrative successfully; also, there is a good deal of Alaskan entomology and chill-survival in the book. Further, the major portion of the novel (i.e., post-Cleveland) is set in the Grenadines, on the Caribbean island of St. Vincent. So it is a book of mixed climates, private nightmares, and slow recoveries of strength. It was a generous reading experience: more and more detail, fascinating inhabitation of a good man's troubled mind, and a series of friendships and rescues that address the trust needed for any long-term recovery from despair or fate or both.My strong recommendation follows from this evidence: I could have read this book all the way to Alaska, then to Cleveland, to St. Vincent, and back to Alaska again.

What is she (Atkinson) doing in this uncommon sequence, and its disdain for expected sequences? Where is she taking me in this unexpected narrative? How could this novel have evolved in this graceful and yet angular way? Its parts seemed folded over each other, not assembled in any usual, contiguous structure, like origami applied to narrative, but not with experimental arrogance. Think of the square folded paper toys you once made out of notebook paper, with ominous fortunes written inside. Or something like that.

The Double -- the name of an art treasure that must be recovered -- holds perhaps the most bloody and ruthless scenes in any book I have read by this author, and the most vivid adulteries, but the code of ethics observed here does cover at least the edge of justice and desperate need. And like the ""salvage worker"" Travis McGee, there is no one other than Lucas to put things right.

We read novels that transcend ""real time"" by tricky assumptions, or compress it with deep details, or vary it through multiple perspectives on one moment. And so it can be destroyed and reconstructed, and relived, in fiction and made less like time as we know it, more like time as we imagine it to be: our experiences kept in the great store that is our brain. (Yesterday, I felt the shame of my schoolchild self, even more vividly than in 1955. I constantly find out that he is not the past at all, and never will be.) The achievements of this extraordinary, brilliant work rely on rendering time as planar and episodic, repeatable with variations and restorations, each episode a different deal of fated cards. Or time is here a flowing unearthly liquid, a medium for floating, a floating world. Toward the end of Life After Life, Atkinson's chosen protagonist Ursula says, ""The past seemed to leak into the present, as if there were a fault somewhere. Or was it the future spilling into the past? Either way it was nightmarish, as if her inner dark landscape had become manifest. ... Here too, she thought. She had been here before. She had never been here before. I give in, she thought. Whatever it is, it can have me."" I too have been taken over, having given in to this telling, yet it has proven to be unlike any other cedings of awareness to a book. This narrative, one feels as he reads, is reconstructing the variable imaginations of time -- really, the contemplation of possibilities -- during the last century's wars in Europe and their complete alteration of lives, geographies and the human conscience. And so I embrace this book for its mastery of design and the interior narration of Ursula's sequential lives, but also for its superior authenticity in rendering the bombing of Britain, including the roughest and least bearable details.

We may know how littleAs generations of witnesses and the value of curiosity disappear from our lives, it is time to forge anew the future of memory. We may know how little we know about the Twentieth Century's most immense homicidal act--the Holocaust, the ""final solution""--but our children and their children are likely to know far less than we do. What we do not know is how little we feel until we read a novel, based on truth, like Ostland. Our most important museums and collections, scholarly accounts based on eternal documentation, and some well-known films (""Shoah,"" ""Schindler's List,"" ""Night and Fog"") continue to provide chilling historic and visual documentation with evocative voices. In our classrooms, poor young Anne Frank repeatedly disappears at the end of her diary, with unknowable implications for the adolescent conscience, and perhaps the assignment gives a moment of pause for a parent capable of grasping the ""lesson"" in Anne's life. (Really, it is an adult story, that diary.) No matter, the tale is barely told, the adult conscience is rarely addressed, at least not until we can see the soldiers who take Anne as other humans, not monsters in jackboots. This novel will be the kind of book that people not yet born will have to read in order to understand the pervasive continuities and chilling likenesses between lawless serial homicide and sanctioned political genocide. Nor is it only the efficient gunshot delivered at the brink of a forest pit that must be heard by new generations: they must come to understand the diligence, the will, and the train schedules necessary for the shot to be fired. Ammunition is distributed along with vodka to control the murderer's shame, his awareness of what his fear of cowardice has brought into his life. The small ambitions of intelligent people, the blind ideologies of leaders, the passive dismissal of moral evidence, the pervasive euphemisms: these are the deforming crimes we must grasp if we can. The events in this book are brutal. During WWII a former Berlin police detective, now an SS officer on the Eastern Front, carries out the ""resettlement"" of German Jews; meanwhile, twenty years later, lawyers are prosecuting him for war crimes. They are relatively obscure elements in an event of massive significance for our time and for all time. We will never end the discovery of its meaning until we are too careless, distracted, and unaware to read and carry forward in our memories and ethics a narrative like this one, where Jews come to the edge of a pit naked, and some turn around to look into the eyes beyond the pistol....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Feb 12, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17556134-ostland

Johnson is writing in the dark, capturing the magic of that bizarro world, North Korea, and its tiny late dear leader Kim Il Sung. The Dear Leader, also the chief fabulist, is magic: his illusions become real, and people who do not believe the illusions are given a brutal new reality by the state because he is also a paranoid murderer and sadist. But the Dear Leader is a minor actor in the book; it is Jun Do, the orphanage refugee who shape-shifts his way from tunnel-rat to government kidnapper to radio-scanner and eventually somehow to become the substitute husband for Sun Moon, a beautiful actress who is the Dear Leader's favorite. It is all a perfectly unbelievable and brilliantly compelling story. Perhaps my fitful reading of it made the book seem long and the shifts in sequence, time and perspective made it seem fragmented, but it was easy to persist. Johnson is a daring writer who fearlessly gives an alternate reality a credible voice (including the voice of the inescapable loudspeaker blaring lies to every household) saying credible things, in an incredibly perverse but seemingly true and pitiless land where people will believe anything that keeps them from being different.

For one member of a generation tempered and still cautioned by Vietnam and the losses and despair of 1968, reading it was unexpectedly visceral. It is a book about the nation, at once the history of a desire for the survival and thriving of our people, but also a record of disintegration and loss of possibility that for me began in 1963 ... and continues this morning. The novel meanders across time and territory -- California, London, Addis Ababa, Berlin -- and opens four or five or six narratives in different periods of recent history. It is about writing, adoption, abandonment, and being a parent, but full of hopeful ambivalence regarding all of these things. To describe these folds of time and history here is neither easy nor worthwhile, nor is it what the novel requires of its reader (see sentence one, above).

We feel with her that he is immature or perhaps delusional, given to a belief in what he has been convinced must be true, that he is the son of God and destined to redeem common people through blood sacrifice. Mary knows that he is more truly her son, though she has been erased from his life to serve the politics of becoming a credible messiah. Her voice is austere and stays on the fine line between bitterness and resignation. As the young man is executed, she disappears quietly, and goes off to live out a solitude, looking back at the crucifixion with remote dispassion. Her life is sacrificed with his, though she lives on to explain this narrative without sentiment, in a cool and uncompromising voice.Two other novels I know are fictions about Jesus, whose name does not appear in Toibin's book. D. H. Lawrence wrote The Man Who Died, about the resurrected protagonist who, having done his job, is free to lead a true life. A. J. Langguth's episodic novel, Jesus Christs, imagines him as an Everyman who takes on multiple guises and appears in unexpected places. Like those novels, Toibin's gives us a view of a man who walks the streets, performs rare and unusual feats, and has a human destiny. He is no less beloved or heroic for all his naïveté. Mary is a poised, aware, and sensible narrator who has pitiably lost a son because he has taken on an exclusive purpose, a unique and ineluctable brand. She must observe his life (and his death) from a distance, with an eye toward the dangers of politicians and soldiers. She wanted more for him; we feel that both he and she deserved far better from their lives....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Nov 26, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13547234-the-testament-of-mary

This began early in the sixties when he had just written a handful of books. I later dropped the pursuit -- though I did keep up with most things Updike -- but it gave me a steady theme of delight and anticipation as a reader when I had none in my life. The Pennsylvania stories, the Maple stories, the Rabbit novels, the sex novels all were pointed and direct, and close to the classes and behaviors of people I could identify and imagine amid the ways of living. I thought of Updike when I read these four long stories, but with a clear sense that Dubus had far surpassed him: what I had once loved in Updike as a young man now came more brilliantly to me as an old one. Andre Dubus III is an American writer of the highest quality and deepest vision.Great adult fiction does justice to lives of error and misconception, of bad moral judgments and failures to look within. Bad mistakes, cheap thrills, compromised hopes, thoughtless sex, failures to attend to others, to be generous. The inability to be kind. Lives in fiction are sacrificed for these crimes, just like lives outside of fiction. Dubus has created four slightly linked instances of people unable to alter or comprehend awful moral judgments, allowing their tensions to become brutally enormous, destructive forces. While the stories are about the slow crises of lives, those crises cannot be resolved by these actors because they require actions made impossible by the blindnesses that have created the crisis. In each story a person looks at the consequences of a life gone off toward something unanticipated, without the prospect of self-rescue. They make unknowing choices, as we all do, and find themselves overlooking a precipice with no choice but to drop off, graceless, wingless and fated. A bank teller gives up her gentle but empty private life for the vague promise of having a boyfriend whose shallowness and dominance are inescapable. A feckless bartender betrays the authentic woman who has given him the possibility of a horizon. A project manager is cuckolded by the wife he has treated like an employee; it is not in his manfully asserted plan. All of the tales share a fittingly rocky setting on the Northeast American shoreline. The title story of Dirty Love, is peerless. Shared by a young woman and her great-uncle, its shuttered interior spaces and privacies are rendered in ways I cannot even attempt to describe: the details, the disappointments, the separations -- beyond their brilliant telling -- cannot be described.

It is SwedishThis better second book, after Misterioso, was written in the pre-dawn of the current century and it has to be read with that awareness. It is Swedish, and so I think that awareness must also include the residual shock surrounding the assassination of Prime Minister Olof Palme in 1986, a crime without a certain perpetrator. It is a police procedural, serial killer novel of the kind I have been reading since finding David L. Lindsey's Mercy 25 years ago. So many have been written, and (since the cannibal genius Hannibal Lecter) so many have been unreadable, gaudy and repulsive, over those years. (It has been redeemed, in my view, by the Millennium novels of Stieg Larsson.) Crime books of the best kind in the latter half of the last century (and still) have kept to the practice of exhuming details, motives, killers and their unusual mentalities. Digging, exposure, then revelation and relief from the horror. What I noticed here is a theme that is now (to me) dominant in the air that surrounds most of my reading. Here is what one voice says at the conclusion of this book: ""The Cold War is over. What has replaced it almost feels worse, because we don't understand what it is. The world is shrinking, and above all, we seem to be shrinking."" This, before September 11, meretricious wars, the shallow culture of the web, and a deeply harmed ideal of democracy. As a reader, my preference in crime novels is the book that addresses the unsolvable, almost unknowable, even invisible, crime. The detective may demonstrate a process of inquiry leading to ""justice,"" but it is more authentically about a darkness that is resistant to light, something that cannot be exhumed. Such books -- and this is one of them -- are about the irresistible desire to overcome that resistance. Bad Blood offers the qualities of ambivalence and ambiguity that readers of the ancient Sjowall/Wahloo novels about Martin Beck will recognize and appreciate. Forget guilt, forget innocence; try to understand complicity and uncertainty. As another voice says, reading in the dim light of one small candle, ""There can never be too little light.""

""Social,"" because the idiosyncrasies and relationships and the contexts of society are all living entities in the reading. (The 87th Precinct books are also among the finest examples.) Serial killers, with all their endurance and precision, are ultimately not very interesting. They overflow with incoherent logics and unbelievable motives. In this book I found there to be no reason for feelings of horror, empathy or acceptance toward the avenger, and it was difficult to construct the mechanics of random connections that instigated the murders.

It is the blankness of his life, and his confusion in its grip, that caused me to read his experiences with great pleasure.

Its themes -- absence and loneliness, crossing a line that cannot be undone, the randomly strange yet devastating ways of family disintegration -- are written with subtle gravity and perfect voice. The narrative is Dell Parsons' telling of his parents' vague and inept bank robbery, their jailing and disappearance from his life and the life of his twin sister. It is also the rare and exquisite occupation of a fifteen year old boy's mind, thinking of losses and erasing expectations. This novel might also be seen among the fine reflective, understated fictions about the prairie and it's people. As I do in the presence of great paintings, I ask how this work in all its depth and resonance could have been made, and what extraordinary plane of awareness Mr. Ford had to occupy in order to capture it so flawlessly.

He is the author of Birdsong, one of the best I have read, so I have expected the disappointment inherent in something other than that memorable book. Disappointed, yes; but this is still fine reading and close to my own sense of what a human life is, a consciousness that grows more complex as I think and age. The novel has five large parts, each devoted to an entire life, five lives lived in variable times and places, including the future. When I became a father and now a grandfather, I saw that when we are born, a story begins, and it is limitless at first: possibility upon possibility, we like to think. But soon in any life the possible strands narrow, some fade and fall away, some remain and become our reasons to be. Early on in most lives, the abundance of the possible disappears, and that is when the real story of a life begins. There may be no grand unifying or sweeping theme in this book other than the immensity of the particular lived experience. Each story is separate and yet each somehow responds the others in nearly tangible ways. (Read the first two and the rest are compulsory.) How we respond to all the voices that call out, to all the duties and responsibilities of love, to what we ourselves want to have happen -- and how we bear it invisibly -- it is all too much to grasp, except one life at a time, and another life, and another, until we see in a small mirror what we mean by living a human life. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jul 18, 2013","Jul 07, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13722330-a-possible-life

But there is little true coincidence here: the barrenness is endemic and pervasive in both the place and the man. Not unlike Tana French's excellent novel, Faithful Place, it is clear in The Blackhouse that the past is a state of mind with tenacious claims on the conscience. And, not unlike Ms. French, Peter May has a superb capacity to clarify the weight of metallic sea, grey stone, peat smoke, tribal manliness, and how these crush the human tendency to expand and grow into a contemporary life. It is a place where breathing is difficult without inhaling infectious spores of one kind or another: betrayed love, economic stagnation, near-primitive protestantism, and all the smothered possibilities deep beneath. May creates the claustrophobic vines of the past, but also assures that its tendrils drag down the living day in a contemporary crime of brutality and amorality. The crime, however, kept slipping from my attention as I read, so thrilling is this writer at portraiture and landscape. His people are not vague, nor are his places scenery: we are there and a part of us wants to stay there and fill our senses, despite what we inhale.

What might American culture have been, had 750,000 boys not perished at Gettysburg, Chickamauga, or Spotsylvania? What if the Europeans had not squandered 1.2 million lives at the Somme alone? Imaginable histories, perhaps, but impossible to write.The impossible history is what fiction captures. Life Class and Toby's Room are novels of the First World War by Pat Barker (this  will be posted under both titles) tracing the intimacy and individuality of how the axe of war dismembers the whole body and spirit of a society, starting with its young, its aging survivors, its poets and artists. Barker writes superbly and with almost impossible subtlety and detail about these lives, in such a way that they become contemporary; we can sense them continuing to have lived among us.Before the war, the undamaged art students in Life Class) strive to draw the human form as perfectly as they can; in its aftermath (in Toby's Room), they capture the shattered faces of men who must wear masks in public. These are visual books, extending our experiences far beyond metaphor or war romance to tell us what the protagonists see, leaving us to reconstruct from their lives what they feel and remember, but rarely speak about, when the killing ends. One protagonist, Paul, is driving an ambulance in Belgium when he sees ""a dark shape ahead. As he slowed down, it was jointed by a second, and then a third. Men, some of them badly wounded, crawling out of the ditches that lined the road. ... They had no faces, only flaking mud masks with white circles round the eyes and red wet mouths struggling to speak. When words failed, they pointed at their wounds."" At another point, the men and the mud of Ypres become indistinguishable, living men turned into dirt. The living dead, rising. More than sixty years ago, at five or six, while I watched my father shave, he pointed to a small scar on his chin, just to the side of his mouth, and told me it was the result of shrapnel that had struck him four decades earlier in France, a small piece that had festered until he had removed it himself after carrying it for years. Other fragmentary traces of metal are probably among his ashes now. Through him I experienced some of the multiple legacies of his experience: remoteness, silence, wounds that do not heal. Now I think of all the questions I did not ask.It has taken nearly a century for that war to emerge from its trench-like hiding place to take its full place among the deep history of pointless sacrifices, the errors of leadership, the deaths of both young men and the dreams they might have shared. Nothing in this deep history holds even a dim candle to the Great War, the First World War, the War to End All Wars. When we observe the centenary of the Great War over the next four years, perhaps that book or essay will have been written. If not, Pat Barker's five rich, insistent, extraordinary, fine novels -- these two, and The Regeneration Trilogy -- will suffice to capture the generational scars....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,Apr 2013,"Jun 24, 2013",,Hardback,view (with text),/book/show/13330599-toby-s-room

He will give you the smell of the dirt and grasses of the High Plains of Colorado. He will never fail to engage your heart, but because he is an honest man, he will have you grasp the nettles. If you have never entered his beautiful singing sentences, I envy you your first time. … This is why writers write and readers read.”  Here is one master praising another and getting it right.Haruf’s novels Plainsong, Eventide, and now Benediction, make good on Carey’s promises, especially the expansive “capacity to love” in ordinary people, in ordinary places. Readers of the western landscape who might anticipate a rough, hard place – Cormac McCarthy’s landscape – encounter in Haruf’s small world in a vast one the settled experiences of town, community, relationship, the human processes of knowing one another. Individual lives and deaths here are gentle fulfillments, human stories, not fates or destinies, or even journeys. Soft threads connect these three books; profound generosity is for me the strongest.Haruf is a beckoning writer: come out, be in this place, open yourself to the air. Read against the human tendency to disappoint and withhold, in a world where it is outbalanced by the more powerful urge to touch and give. In his work -- as in the work of Mark Spragg (Where Rivers Change Direction), J. Robert Lennon (On the Night Plain), and Russell Rowland (In Open Spaces) – we see microcosmic, ordinary family dramas working themselves out with the help of the human capacity.The town of Holt, Colorado, is on the dry plains east of Denver, defined by people, weather, crops and geographies, not grand motions of history or drama. A reader tends to savor instead the minuscule, nearly invisible moments of moral clarity and intimate grace that guide a life. People standing near each other, allowing themselves to be shaped by each other, forgiving each other as needed for frail moments, yet hardly forgiving themselves for poor choices and failures to be kind.In Benediction a long summer death sustains the interactions of people, but the past is also definitive, its ghosts present, its acts vital though unspoken. At its end, I came to feel that Holt is a place -- as this novel is a place -- where bitterness seems to have been washed away, and where people survive by enveloping and embracing each other. If we, like Peter Carey, admire reading that engages and extends a capacity for love -- in contrast to the capacity for cynicism or arrogance, vengeance and greed – how many great works of literature or great works of art in any form can we number?

A generationThere is a period of history in Britain between the end of World War I and the beginning of World War II that is rich matter for weeping. A generation had been decimated -- literally and figuratively -- and, as one voice in this novel puts it, no longer has ""the freedom to think hopefully of the future."" That is a freedom that has never been recovered, and it never will be. Such novels as this one transcend genre; it is nominally a book about solving a mystery, but it is far more a deep and moving landscape of Britain before, during, and after the Great War. Jacqueline Winspear gives Maisie Dobbs so fine a backstory and so rich a sensibility that the reader wishes her to wander off into another kind of fiction altogether: one that tells only the story of those who must live on after their lives have been lost, those whose dreams are inescapably ridden by horrors experienced in the trenches, and those who know in the most personal ways how deeply a nation can betray its promises. That would be a novel of crime far more devastating than even this fine one. One also wishes -- unusually -- that such an unwritten book would be longer than this first volume in a series. There can never be enough said about these betrayals and their lessons almost exactly a century later. As the hundredth anniversary of the war's onset approaches, it is useful to anticipate the questions to be asked, for the truth-telling that is still necessary. No one responsible for sacrificing a generation is still living, nor are the remnants of that generation itself alive, so we might hope for some direct inquiries, clear speaking, and the plain documentation we need in order to believe the incredible. The war is over. There is nothing to lie for, no hidden decision to cover up, no one to protect any longer. I hope we can be clear, at last and in justice, about who makes war and who dies in it. Reading this fine book is completed with a veil of sadness over all, but it stands for hundreds of thousands of stories and losses, and countless indefensible sacrifices.(In my next s -- of Pat Barker's novels Life Class and Toby's Room -- these themes will reappear.

HIn the back inside cover of an old Whole Earth Catalog there was a poem by Kenneth Patchen that came back to me while I was reading this fine novel. Here is a part of it:... So far you'veNot been near exceptWhen you didn't know.Night's day was everywhere.No one is ever separatedFrom every otherFor then the world would die.And the world does not die!O Glory, Glory of the Light!WE LIVE ONE LIFE.Message ends.It is such a minor and conventional message, not intellectual or even very reflective. (Of course it belonged in the Whole Earth Catalog for exactly those reasons.) But I came to think of it because All That Is gives us one adult life and that is all it is: one life. The Second World War begins it, the life stumbles into a profession, experiences disillusion after disillusion, has a marriage that ends, the life has extraordinary sexual encounters and searing passions. It moves from place to place and from time to time with the blandest of social and political backgrounds. At the novel's center, Philip Bowman lives a life of all that one life can be, except for the lasting bonds of mutuality and transfer that can happen only in long and permanent human relationships. There are few of these in all of this.Bowman's marriage primarily serves to demonstrate what a transient, shallow thing marriage can be; it is not an authentic alliance. He does not do it again. He is not a parent, and so cannot experience the selfless intensity of being bonded to a child. These are not parts of Bowman's life, making it not only cool and adept, but shallow and predatory. Nor is his steadily adventurous sexual career enough to fill a life. His multiple but destructive passions with voracious and unavailable women are illusions: each fresh, dramatic consummation Bowman experiences seems idyllic at first, but is in fact the beginning of an inevitable decline, a cruel betrayal, or melancholy drift. It seems a life without a lasting truth or character, incapable of doing more than simulating authenticity. In All That Is Salter is a master -- like Philip Roth and Saul Bellow -- of telling a male life in midcentury, ostensibly successful but vacant at heart. While reading I also thought of John Fowles's masterful, forgotten but brilliant novel,Daniel Martin. All of these writers (and John Updike, and Joseph Heller, and Richard Russo, and others) have also told the shallowness of being a troubled man among the women and work of the postwar half-century. Through decades of wars, sexual domination, personal crimes and misdemeanors, sweeping social revolutions, and the grinding of one hypocrisy against another, men have grown (it seems to me) in very few ways, and very slowly. Yet reading this novel was an extraordinary pleasure, each sentence elegant, concise, and telling, Salter's voice and Bowman's story having no false notes. Salter has to be regarded equally among the other writers mentioned here as an artist to acclaim and savor.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"May 30, 2013","Apr 09, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13330444-all-that-is

And as a product of its time all the basic elements are here, probably more than needed. In fact, it is an overstuffed work, and one star less in quality than Parker's best work, like Silent Joe, Red Light, and Black Water. (However, it is not as preposterous as his most recent books in the Charlie Hood series, as that is a difficult criterion to match.)""Overstuffed"" works. The excessive serial killer, a looney, anti-immigrant, anti-black, anti-Semitic, anti-LGBT (before the acronym!), a loner (uh-oh), way before his time. He is made of cardboard scraps, it seems to me; yet today he could serve in Congress. Then there is the narrator, a writer-reporter, used-to-be cop, married to his much younger great love, but still torching for his beautiful bombshell of a feckless ex. Her name is Amber Mae. His current wife is no tramp, of course, but she is dying of cancer and is about to have a critical brain operation, a step he cannot pay for. (Even a health insurance investigator turns up to turn the screws.) There is a beautiful and questionable adult daughter (a child with the haunting-but-feckless ex), who appears for the purpose of confusing things. She hates the mother, i.e., the h-b-f ex, who has dragged her around the world as her beautiful accoutrement until her lovely youthful scent overwhelms the mother's appeal to suitors. Still, she is opaque to us and to her father, the writer, used-to-be cop. She is pretty opaque to everyone. There is also a malicious homicide cop, who is also an ex of the haunting ex, and he does evil things to the writer, out of suspicion and, um, malice. And there is also a scholarly narcissist (redundant?), a noted serial killer expert who is advising the police on subtle strategies -- oh and yes, he too is an ex of the haunting ex who seems to be everybody's ex -- and yet he seems pretty straight and trustworthy ... but ... but ...No  here, but enough parts lying around in the second paragraph for anyone to assemble the entire plot without my help. It's easy! Also, it's California, where serial killers are plentiful and diverse, so it's difficult to go wrong in expecting the expected. Had I read this as a younger man it probably would have been more enticing than now. Parker can write, as his finer books demonstrate. But this serial-killer genre novel really does not even aspire to transcend the genre or to define it. Oh, one more thing. Remember the haunting ex? Well, there is also the milkman, the postman, a plumber ... no, not really! Just a joke! But feel free to imagine them as even more exes, just outside the plot....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Mar 29, 2015","Apr 09, 2013",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/170939.Summer_of_Fear

All of these elements were thoroughly engaging in Broken Harbor, Tana French's latest Irish cop book, where the crime involves grisly domestic violence (slashing and child murder). The procedures of solving were fine, if too frequently subject to the prime detective (Scorcher Kennedy) taunting and bullying just about everyone. I criticize this book by my observation that nearly everyone in it -- adult victims, cops, Schorcher's young sister, a feckless younger cop, a feckless competing cop, the suspects, and of course, the guilty -- is in need of serious mental health care. I am sure there are options available -- especially for the mood-swinging sister, who desperately needs medication -- but there are none evident in this Irish social landscape. It could have created a useful layer for the book, contrasting those beyond treatment with those slowly receiving it. It is also one kind of life-saving learning that the overbearing, self-absorbed Scorcher could use. A cop with a past, he has no future without some insight and a large amount of appropriate humility.My rating makes it clear: it's another fine book by Ms. French, whose standards of excellence are very high. While waiting for the next one from her, or something new from John Lawton, it is a good time to pick up some Denise Mina and fill in the gaps on my unread P. D.

I picked it up as a kind of palate cleanser before attempting some heavier items. At 20 pages, I put it down; then I picked it up again this afternoon, just to be able to write this . First, the NYRB Press deserves great scorn for packaging this as a classic thriller. It is not. It is not thrilling, not mysterious, not enticing, not smart, not ingenious. Second, but -- Mon Dieu!! -- it is French and that is probably why it got the classic noir misnomer. It is, in fact, like those black & white French movies of the sixties where people mope about and say inexplicably emotional things while showing no emotion whatever, gazing off-screen at the crew, and behaving without perceptible rationality. Smoking unfiltered Gauloises, of course, while evoking not one teensy soupçon of care. But in French, with subtitles.Third, ""inauthentic"" is the word. Well, maybe ""inartistic"" and ""amateurish"" are other words.Fourth, the translator needed help, in order to avoid such passages as ...""Wait!"" cried the baron, plunging after her. ""You are a terrifyingly negative and beautiful person."" He tripped over one of the filthy rugs and fell to one knee. ""Listen up!"" he said.

This reflects my evolution aLike other readers here, I was drawn by critical acclaim to read this book, and I come away from it with some admiration. This reflects my evolution as a reader: I pause to applaud good sentences more often than ever, I appreciate a novel where a protagonist's darting mind and eye are opened for us to see, and I deeply admire the ""structure"" of walking, observing, and thinking. The city is also of course a place for hiding and wearing masks, for designing the anonymity that hides identity; the reader will find these here as well. The narrator is an isolated professional of mixed European and African ancestry in a city where mix is the rule. He appears to have just one friend and engages in human relationships out of intellect rather than feeling. Much of his large intelligence also hides a personal emptiness, an anomie. While I admire his belief in what psychiatry ought to be -- ""provisional, hesitant, and as kind as possible"" -- I also find myself thinking that a life of larger value is different: committed, intense and loving (rather than kind). In observing the narrator, I asked questions in a particular format: What kind of person walks the city all night long? What kind of person must always stay in motion? What kind of person remains untouchable and evidently passionless? There are other questions raised by this quietly complex and very well-written book. Is this coldness a mode of survival for the new culture of dislocation and hybridity? And how, specifically, in our lives and choices, and in how we become who we are, do we live in judgment of our own good and evil acts? My answer on the day after finishing this book is this: uneasily, because there is only evanescent clarity and very little light to judge by. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jan 16, 2013","Jan 17, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8526694-open-city

Harry Michael Connelly's novels about Harry Bosch caught my attention early in the series, and my understanding of the character continues to evolve. Harry himself is an unfinished man, matched to a profession that requires a raw and intuitive grounding in process, rather than cleverness or bold charisma. It is not by accident that Harry served as a tunnel rat in the Vietnam conflict: he is still driven in part by suspicion, and still working below the surface of things, making bare and tentative progress toward an end that remains largely invisible. It also fits that he is rapidly aging on the LAPD cold case squad, chafing under harassment by an ambitious tool at its head. Harry does not have much more time to serve in the police, therefore his cases seem to be forms of investment against the erasures of time -- and that special, haunting invisibility. As much as these novels are police procedurals, they are even better understood as personal procedurals: the detective is slow to trust anyone, hard on partners, and shows equal disdain for criminals and any other police who have ""no clue as to what they were really doing here ... no idea about the mission."" Here, following an ethical imperative to recover some just end for a forgotten Danish reporter murdered during the Los Angeles riots in 1991, Harry Bosch reminded me of another fictional archaeologist of California death, Lew Archer, the masterful creation of Ross MacDonald. Archer once described himself as ""a garbage collector on the moral scene."" Harry's moral character also reminds me of Matthew Scudder, the unlicensed New York private detective invented by Lawrence Block. (Charles Durning's death yesterday reminds me of how well he would have embodied Harry or Matt, alas.) Private detection is about initiative and intellect, a mixed amount of hubris and disdain, and much rueful cogitation. Police detection at its best includes public service, the politics of cities, attention to process and order, and a scuffed idealism still capable of surviving a compromised system and its human wreckage, often including the narrow life of the detective. The best police fiction -- and Connelly has written twenty or more examples -- has a civic, moral, faithful core, driven by nobility, conscience, and losses. Great crime fiction of this kind is a deep and bitter excavations of the self. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Dec 25, 2012","Dec 26, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13495034-the-black-box

It is a memory book, a book about relationships, a book about childhood blinders. But it is less than all of these, rather than more. Reading John McGahern's By the Lake, I came to feel the calm and silent interior world of place and residents; a book where I felt nothing happened, I entered its place and found that everything happened there. Banville here disappoints, where McGahern delighted. Having found Banville's astonishing crime books (as Benjamin Black) to surpass anything of the genre, I had expected the same kind of brilliant, careful, lingering sentences and momentary caesuras of perception here. But they were not abundant in The Sea, though the place and its people, and the actors in place promised more. There should have been more, not just to please a reader, but to educe the unspoken ideas of loss here and the search to understand it, to recover something from it. Banville could have made me more mindful of what losses a life is made of. I have immediately turned back to reading Colm Toibin's The Master, and find in it much of the exquisite sensibility I had hoped to see in Banville.

As a black veteran in postwar Los Angeles, he is an artful gymnast always on shaky ground, trying to remain human while maintaining the uneasy balance of a job, a home, and experiences with the depravities of white and black cultures. His treasured house is his anchor; the dissonances of war remain consequential and ambiguous, but having a place in the world makes Easy more of a man likely to survive. Always a reluctant detective, I think, he takes on the quest in order to be a man who can help to make things right. While he is honorable and conscientious in this way, dire threats surround him from everywhere, and there is no trust or guidance to master the fears he must negotiate. In my notes for a talk I gave about this book, I acknowledged how little I cared to know the fact of guilt or innocence, or method or motive.

Here time and urgency appear in the tensions surrounding possible retirement from the job that defines him, the anticipations and needs of his daughter who adores him, and the great hope for love that even the hardest case cultivates. Harry indefatigably works two challenging cases at once, commandeering his partner in ways that damage their relationship. In stress and challenge, he constantly reveals himself to us, even in unflattering ways, and every once in a while we return to the frightened young soldier he was in the tunnels of Vietnam. He is secretive and abrupt, intolerant and suspicious of his colleagues and superiors. But these edges and flaws make Harry work on to demand truth beyond supposition, and cause him to be the engine of justice (or if not, comprehension of the past) that he is. We do not find him to be easily lovable; we find him to be undeniably magnetic and uncompromising. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Feb 25, 2012","Mar 02, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11082037-the-drop

Certain scenes in that book had always stayed with me, however. Returning to him now, I find that Alan Banks has continued to age with me: we are reading the same nonfiction books, he and I (Tony Judt), listening to the same music (sweet jazz), and drinking the same red wine. His experiences with Annie Cabbot, so riveting in the earlier book, are recollected here, but she is at a difficult, loose-ends kind of moment in her life. We first meet her waking up from a one-night stand with a feckless young musician. We want her to find something stable, though it will not likely be with Banks. There are two crimes here, one for Banks and one for Cabbot, with moments where they cross. One of the finest parts of great crime novels is when two minds expand in that crossing, one enlarging the other with questions and possibilities. There is no bitterness in these books, but hope -- at least for Banks -- and the recognition that a course of life contains many changes. Such complexities make us richer as we read. That is another advantage of these long sequences of consistently fine fiction: experiences accrue for us all. (It is an important aspect of Philip Roth's genius -- and Updike's -- that we live with some of their flawed protagonists over multiple books.)

AbUnion General William Tecumseh Sherman's practice of scorched earth warfare in his march across Georgia is an example of humiliation beyond defeat. Absolutely punitive, the practice sought to reverse the arrogance of secessionism and the crime of shattering the union by destroying the economy, transportation, class, culture, and cities of the Confederacy. We feel the effects still, recognizing the difficulty of renewal and recovery after thorough defeat. As it is with other firestorms, landscapes and populations bear historical scars. We recognize PTSD today, but reading  by E. L. Doctorow is a reminder that it is likely to have been a constant sickness emergent from all wars. Sherman knows this and begins his march to the sea as a way of breaking the will of the south, in part by its sheer audacity, in larger part by its uncompromising cruelties. It is clear that what has been created in the action is something that cannot be led, even by Sherman. The war is a dark forest, and the march is an excavation or an incomparable clearcutting. Its long tail is described as a living organism of many segments, comprising more than 60,000 troops, thousands of freed slaves and other hangers-on. Publishers Weekly called its episodic stories ""kind of a grim Civil War Canterbury Tales."" The march is a huge creeping segmented insect, irresistible and terrible. Updike called it ""a floating world. It devours people and takes over their lives, digests their possessions and identities, and it carries the reader inevitably forward.Sherman's brilliant musings, vignettes of experiences among civilians, soldiers and slaves, the military moves and strategies -- are all dramatic and superb. Their destinies are suddenly entwined and common. Doctorow allows multiple voices to speak their truths without judgment, though most reasonable voices are heard from the Union side. Reading this book occasionally caused me to think about the title of a book by Chris Hedges: War is a Force that Gives us Meaning. Ironically, having seen its meaninglessness, Sherman might agree. This is a superb novel, probably Doctorow's best, full of questions that cannot be asked or even tentatively answered except in the dread of war. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jan 07, 2012","Jan 10, 2012","Jan 07, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/24914.The_March

It was written almost a lifetime ago, in 1999, when the claims of AIDSI hope to read all of Toibin's fictions, and this is another reason to do that. It was written almost a lifetime ago, in 1999, when the claims of AIDS were prevalent, causing lives to disappear and families to implode. The narrator of this family fiction is Helen, married to Hugh and the mother of two; she has time alone while they are off to see Hugh's parents. Helen's surviving parent, Lily, is so unbearable to Helen that the husband, children and Lily have never met over the ten years of their marriage. There is Helen's grandmother as well, who lives by the sea; the novel occurs in her house above the strand. The grandmother also carries grudges eternally -- did I mention that this is an Irish family? -- and none of them is far below the surface when all the blood relations come together. The reason for the tense reunion is Declan, Helen's brother and Lily's son, who is dying of AIDS. Closeted to his family, he has two close and caring friends who are also in the house, giving nursing care, advice, and some solace. There is not enough of that solace to go around all these raw relationships. Suffused with the promise of an impending death, these lives need to change, if only to speak without lacerating each other. The novel is a dive into the transactions, resentments and errors that disable and confuse families, often until the imminence of death itself erodes the sharp edges and grudges honed over decades. Toibin's writing is as it always is: detailed and succinct, intensely personal and specific, driving below the secretive layers and traces of lives, to dwell in what hearts and memories cannot bear, but must be borne. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Mar 18, 2014","Nov 27, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/43702.The_Blackwater_Lightship

At midcentury, when this book is set, the limits of free will werBrooklyn inspires me to think about the history of making choices in personal lives. At midcentury, when this book is set, the limits of free will were bounded by faith and moral judgment, by biology, guilt, and suffocating beliefs. Sin appeared in hard common parlance, yet forgiveness was more obscure. Perhaps ignorance ought to be cited as well, but it was part of the accusatory landscape, a given element of the time, like cigarettes and alcohol. People made poor choices simply to resolve ambiguities, to construct a small fenced haven, or to rescue themselves from their families. By twenty, or sooner, a life path was set, and barring accidents, one followed the course as prescribed. It is one reason for the slow change of the world.Here Colm Toibin writes impeccably from within the mind of Eilis, a young Irish woman, starting out as an immigrant in postwar Brooklyn, living bullied and friendless in a cloistered rooming house, working in a ladies' department store while studying bookkeeping. She finds her way and crafts an independent life. The mysteries of her narrow experience and progress are told through her own confusions and momentary clarities, as though Toibin had copied her letters or stolen her diaries. She begins to find herself, to express an adult's self-confidence, and to inspire trust and affection in her parochial Irish world. At a Catholic church dance she and a young Italian man are drawn to each other. Then events -- a loss, a voyage, a return to the past -- teach their lessons to the innocent.The fine craft of this novel reminded me of how much fiction depends on the many small but lifelong injustices we inherit at birth. Fate is local, internal, familial far more than it is cosmic. When we think we are most free, such injustices come to us, to shut down our imagination of the difference we want to live. I do not find solace or joy in these novels, and I do not admire innocence for its own sake. The purpose of innocence is to disappear. What I found here is a kind of greatness central to the purpose of fiction: lives explained, fates determined, innocence inevitably compromised. I am piling up books by Colm Toibin; I hope to find more of this mastery in other lives he has inhabited.

It is set in 1997, as the reader is often reminded, and gives us the context for Reacher's separation from the Army, -- followed by his thumb-out-on-the-highway career of bringing justice to the dark land of America. Reacher is certainly a superhero, not merely an everyday polymath with muscle, and appropriate self-confidence (as a superhero must). Unlike other Reacher stories, we get an abundant sense of the sexual super-heroism of which he is also capable. But Reacher chooses to step outside the army path in order to deliver what people deserve, too bad for them. It is not the Army kind of justice, however, and he cannot go back. At the end of this novel, as we know but Reacher does not, thumb-out super-heroism calls.

It is as clear a case of self-rescue as we can find. The victimAmong the confessions of the contemporary world, this book must rate above all others. It is as clear a case of self-rescue as we can find. The victim and the willful girl of The Liar's Club and Cherry grows into chronological adulthood carrying all the burdens of those books, and more. Lit might well be an exemplification of the truth I first read about in Alice Miller's books: our upbringing gives us more than we can bear, before we can know what is being done to us. And so Mary Karr writes, marries, has a baby boy, drinks and drinks and drinks, and crashes. And fitfully recovers, crashes, recovers, and turns Catholic.If I am morose, I turn to the great classic music of the Church -- chants and masses -- perhaps for some of the same qualities Mary Karr finds in the high order, clarity of faith, and surely unequalled poetry of Catholicism. (I grew up among Catholic kids, and might easily have been one among them, had the church not opposed my long-divorced father when my parents married.) The music, the art, the language all were not part of my life until I could discover them as an adult, I regret to say. But I don't regret not being Catholic as much as I regret having grown up in the bland church of my youth. Now, Catholic cruelty and lack of generosity are clear to me. Pederasty, absolutism, papal infallibility, the dictatorial treatment of women, the anti-progressivism, anti-abortion, anti-birth control orthodoxies ... well, I could not be part of that for the shame of it. And so it's uncomfortable for me to see Mary Karr embrace the Church, though I think she needs its rites and prayers. No, that's not all, she needs more: its immense forgiveness, its image of that poor boy Jesus taking it all on, and its multiple forms of grace. I am unsure, but if it has meant her survival, I cannot complain, she is so brilliant. And yet: What thinking and writing might be forbidden to her or place her in conflict? Where does the Church cause her to stand among women and their lives? How might her astonishing gifts as a writer be compromised or unrealized beyond Lit, because the Church is so central to her life, as the bottle once was? (Two thoughts arrive now. 1. Driving home from Georgia I always notice a billboard encouraging people to trust in Jesus. I wonder what the difference might be if the sign said ""Jesus trusts in you."" That is, what if Jesus expressed confidence in the divine human, the ethical divine, the generous and kind centrality of our lives, in our strength to sort through ambiguities among others? I admire a faith that encourages people to live up to a reflective model (Jesus, Buddha) and to feel a fellowship among shared conflicts. 2. In the dim years of my twenties, I read a novel by A. J. Langguth called Jesus Christs, where Jesus kept showing up in different guises, a real person, a complexity, an example of imperfect humanity. And here is one more: 3. D. H. Lawrence's corporeal Jesus in The Man Who Died. I like the idea of multiple Jesuses.)Over time, we all have adored gifted and besotted writers: Hart Crane, Hemingway, Dylan Thomas, Fitzgerald, Dashiell Hammett, Faulkner, just to start. But they all died of it, as people we know in our own lives have died of it. Therefore I will take pleasure in adoring the sober Mary Karr, hoping her torments are responsive to the life of faith, but hoping with equal fervor that the fearless essayist will write more about herself as a teacher and a writer, as a sister, as a parent. We know her as a child, living a victimized and vandalized life. Here we can know her as a woman, growing through her long passage across the rope-bridge of survival. And beyond, there are always torments, no matter what our church. I wish her a long, productive life; I wish her a generous, fruitful, and forgiving genius. I also wish her continued self-rescue. It is required of us every day. I often tell people to seek out ""The Life-line,"" Winslow Homer's great painting in Philadelphia (there are other versions too), and to understand that he has painted all of our lives in that one image. Homer's great painting could have been the jacket image for this matchless book....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Nov 05, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6340016-lit

I began by talking about the challenges to the reader in The Killer Angels: keeping the geographies and personalities clear, clarifying and grasping the perspectives of North and South, and the simple disadvantage of knowing how the battle comes out. But I also introduced some special challenges to reading about the Civil War itself. Old data say that 620,000 died; new data (9/21/2011) put it at 750,000. Using the first numbers, think of this: 204,000 were deaths in battle; 314,000 were deaths from disease (scurvy, typhus, dysentery, pneumonia, malnutrition): and the Union Army recorded 25,000 deaths in Confederate military prisons. (The Confederacy had poor medical service, so its losses to disease and wounds were worse. Farm boys were especially vulnerable.) Using losses and days, one table provides the deaths-per-day of American wars: For example, in World War II, 416 died each day. In Vietnam, an average of 26 died each day of the war. In the Civil War, 600 people died each day. At the Battle of Gettysburg, the topic of this novel, the 26th Regiment of North Carolina lost 714 of 800 men, 584 on the first day of fighting. The 24th Michigan Regiment lost 362 of 496 men. The 1st Minnesota Regiment lost 82 percent; the 141st Pennsylvania lost 75.7 percent. Losses were equivalent to 2% of the US population. More than 3000 horses were killed at Gettysburg.Although The Killer Angels attends to the generals and colonels in command, none of this blood is missed. The generals could walk or ride to the front line, could see the enemy in its camps, and had clear ideas of imminent reckonings. Shaara is simply brilliant in opening the hearts of his military men, allowing us to grasp their allegiances and to see them weep. To the generals, this is a moral war as well as a mortal one, and therefore it is filled with ambiguities and tensions. It is fought on American soil. It is fought against former comrades and friends. It is not about territory, kingship, faith, incursion, or transgression. It is largely about punishment, fragility, and shattered interdependence. It is leaden with variables: tactics, troops, geography, weather, arms, food, sleep, leadership, trust. History, memory, bravery, courage, resolve, loyalty, friendship, and respect are all played out, literally, on the field.Shaara's brilliance lies in his use of the monologue, diary- and letter-like personal perspectives out of the minds and perspectives of Chamberlain and Longstreet (the most compelling of the book), and Lee, whose portrait is the most detailed. He is a living saint to his men; they pause, applaud, cheer and sing for him. Bands strike up martial music in his presence. He is a source of tragic awe. General Longstreet sees him arrive early on the morning of the terrible third day of battle:Lee came out of the mists. He was tall and gray on that marvelous horse, riding majestically forward in the gray light of morning outlined against the sky, the staff all around him and behind him. Lee alone in the center, larger than them all, erect, soldierly, gazing eastward toward the enemy line. He rode up, saluted grandly. Longstreet rose. Lee rested both hands on the pommel of his saddle. The mist thickened and blew between them; there was a ghostly quality in the look of him, of all his staff, ghost riders out of the past, sabers clanking, horses breathing thick and heavy in thick dank air.Lee is flawed and failing, and costs the Confederacy the battle, and that costs the Confederacy the entire war. But this novel exists far apart from the idea of victory and loss: it is about tension and conflict that rends flesh and bone as it rends society and human nature. This is the finest Civil War novel, based on the opinions of others. It is among the strongest, fateful, inevitable war novels I have read. It is deeply compelling, grounded on history, but not on history alone. Though it is clearly and fastidiously based on documentary sources, what Shaara tells here lives and breathes. It is what cannot be told in archives, tables, maps, or (in Edmund Wilson's words) patriotic gore....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Sep 26, 2011","Oct 14, 2011","Sep 26, 2011",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/682804.The_Killer_Angels

Even if they are told with astonishing shallowness, the stories of twentieth-century African-American life are here, however: the race story (too hidden), the faith story (too overt), the family story (too distorted, too unplumbed), the coming of age story (extreme, bizarre, florid), and the sexual identity story (it's not easy being black, gay, Christian, southern ... clearly). But there is no insightful interior talk, no reflection in the main actor, and far-too-rare passages offering perspective, sequence, purpose to the story.These themes are James Baldwin's themes, handled with less eloquence and focus, less wisdom and depth. (Kenan is a Baldwin scholar.) It is a good thing to write a coming of age novel, full of ways taken and not taken, full of confusions and ambiguities. Maybe every life, with its mix of joyful strands and painful experiences, deserves one. But it is better (I believe) to write from the other side of the passion and the doubt, where the feelings are no less fervent, but the prose is under much better control. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Sep 23, 2011","Sep 23, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17323.A_Visitation_of_Spirits

The war, before the war, after the war -- these are times of fear, uncertainty, resentment, social politics, and slow recovery. Without the excavations in novels of this kind, details of feeling would disappear and generations would be misremembered. This series has not been published in chronological order, but it is not difficult to piece the sequence together. (Second Violin, Bluffing Mr. Churchill, Black Out, A Lily of the Field, Old Flames, Flesh Wounds, A Little White Death) As a companion to this work, Any Human Heart by William Boyd (just seen in a British series) is not to be missed; I have a small but growing shelf of London war books assembled nearby as well. First among them is the Connie Willis pair. Of the seven Lawton books published, I have read six; he cannot write them fast enough for me, so I have to keep a few alternates on hand.When reading about Britain in the Second World War, especially during the early years of the bombings, it is important to remember this: they did not know who would win, how it would work out, what would happen. Ambiguity and danger: places where the heartfelt moral life matters most. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Sep 20, 2011","Sep 21, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7894342-a-lily-of-the-field

My gratitude is enhanced bThis has been the perfect book for me, never once a disappointment over my slow months of reading it, and I am so grateful. My gratitude is enhanced by its unpredictability: Henry James has never become very readable for me, as I tried to do when I was very young. Now I see that I had been misled by a teacher who had too small a concept of the age and patience reading James requires. So I had led myself to open The Ambassadors, never quite figuring out a word of it, thinking at times it had been written through thick gauze and then translated from some other language.As a result, James has always stood as the embodiment of high sensibility, a lofty poshness of bloodless prose, hardly an American writer at all. Not Dreiser or Howells, certainly not Whitman, not Emerson. Not that kind of mastery or sensuality. How my affection for a novel about Henry James has occurred is a mystery. A mystery: I think that is the purpose reading, to find a mystery at its heart. Any reading, newspaper, diary, garden book. Why does this happen? What must happen next? How does this engender thought? What are these unprecedented thoughts?The Master was an experience of slow, interrupted reading, always in the background as I struggled to write a long chapter about the aesthetics of fiction, and how that art works within us as we read and live it. Toward the end, the essay uses the words of Mark Edmundson. ""“The test of a book lies in its power to map or transform a life. The question we would ultimately ask of any work of art is this: Can you live it?” (Why Read?, p. 129) I lived this book and experienced the qualities of light in its English and Italian rooms. I noted its extraordinary feelings: the interior longing for confidence in love; the complexity and doubt of human relationships, doubling and folding over with age and memory; and the immeasurable distances between persons seated in the same room, gazing at the same sculpture, or grieving the same loss. Reading slowly, I lived Henry's thinking, lived at Henry's pace.The novel begins in 1895 and ends in 1899, just as the year turns into a new age. Henry, born in 1843, will die in 1916, outliving his siblings. William James and his wife Alice are strongly present in the final chapter; their parents, sister Alice and two brothers are present in flashbacks as well. (The mother sends a message from the grave, in fact.) This period includes a catastrophic writing failure; finding a home away from London; a retrospective view of the Civil War, inspired by a visit from Oliver Wendell Holmes; travel to Italy; surviving the loss of a beloved woman; a passionate but unconsummated friendship with a young sculptor; a family reconciliation with a view toward death. A book, therefore, about loneliness and silence; about exile and about being American; about a complicated family of genius; about responsibility and guilt; about creating a place for oneself; about sleeping alone for a long lifetime.At the end of the book, speaking about writing with the visiting Edmund Gosse (who is about to write about his own conflicted life in Father and Son) Henry is asked to tell ""the moral"" of planned stories he has begun to write. One story is about a man who anticipates something dreadful for all his life, not seeing until it is too late that ""his own coldness"" is the catastrophe. Another is about an intelligent man with a suppressed ""sensuous nature."" Toibin writes, ""'The Moral?' Henry thought for a moment. 'The moral is the most pragmatic we can imagine, that life is a mystery and that only sentences are beautiful, and that we must be ready for change ..."" The moment is celebratory and light, in fact, but it closes with these truths: Henry embodies human resonance in all its unclarity, and sentences are beautiful.Toibin is himself a master of the telling, knifepoint sentence. In a recent interview he says he once told a class, “You have to be a terrible monster to write."" That is, you must be willing to cut out and thieve the intimacies of others for your fiction and coldly put them on display. And yet here, Henry James has had five years of his life, and all the ruminations in it, stolen for these pages in a way that softens his monstrosity for me, and elevates the writer's heartlessness to a form of exquisite art. It helps me to revise my thinking, and to understand the irony that the failed writer fails because he has not been heartless enough.This is a book that I will not recommend because my joy as its reader cannot be trusted or assumed to transfer, though I think it is a rare and unpredictably moving masterpiece. I am now a decade older than Henry James was in 1899 and I too am far from where I started. I understand his distances from others; his disappointments with himself; the definitive Jamesian quality of restraint and longing; the desire and captivity of words. But I can just barely imagine the density of the tapestries of James's perceptions, their great weight; the continuities traced among lives and settings; nor can I fully grasp the rooms, the images in those mindful tapestries. However, I think with great admiration that they have been beautifully taken from the master and threaded here by Toibin's hand....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,not set,"Sep 20, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/43691.The_Master

Jefferson Parker (and Thomas Perry) occupy the same tier as Michael Connelly, though Connelly's mastery is somewhat more reliable. Parker's novels The Blue Hour, Red Light, Silent Joe, and Black Water preceded this one, and California Girl and The Fallen followed it. That productive period (1999-2006) tapped a vein of fine, steadily readable narrative, engaging detective work, always with a personal jagged edge and a tendency toward emotional flaws of the kind that bring shame to the cop. Frequently the flaw is irresistible sex with an irresistible suspect, not a surprise and completely forgivable in my view. Appearances of guilt, innocence, corruption, and greed shift and expand throughout the narrative, keeping truth in play throughout the whole. Though their moral territories are similar, the setting is south of Harry Bosch, and even south of Ross MacDonald: San Diego, where the border is both criminally alluring and so convenient.

But the Parker series by Richard Stark (Donald Westlake), and the Butcher's Boy series by Thomas Perry are so superbly crafted that they set a high standard. Lawrence Block also has a series devoted to a hit man who is devoted to philately, and I have read some of these as well. There is a new Butcher's Boy volume out, so I have read Sleeping Dogs (from 1992) to catch up. I found the novel to be bracing and superb, and its hero to be almost completely and consistently amoral throughout. Apart from the occasional stranger in the crossfire, few people who die -- and there are quite a few, because the Butcher's Boy is good at what he does -- are worth sympathy. But what makes these compelling is Perry's ability to write so evenly about the killer, the English woman he loves, his life as an exile, the federal agent who has followed him for a decade, and the made men usually at the wrong end of the silencer. The Butcher's Boy also tells us a good deal about his experiences as an apprentice in the trade, the lessons he was taught by the butcher himself, and how it is to live deeply beneath notice.

But Doctorow, like Roth, gives us a life to read and it is, briefly, ours. (I have never met Mr. Doctorow, but I have in fact met his brother. Really.) This is a New York novel, but it is also a novel of obsessive collecting, and -- despite the openness of that city and the grandeur of a Fifth Avenue house -- it is about a life of claustrophobic nearness, mistrust, and disconnection from the world. Part of the world does come into the Collyer brothers' house, but it can never displace the irrationality and insularity of the two men who live there, among newspapers by the ton, multiple pianos, an automobile in the dining room, and an impenetrable dark.

There is a 250-page novel somewhere inside these 500+ pages, and it is a sorry thing that Malone did not cut the excess, the smartass dialogue, the Southern flamboyance, and the multiple characters whose contributions to the narrative are negligible clutter. The redemption comes from the women, the fine court scenes, and the persistent (but too often obscured) theme of conscience throughout the book. For a book about race, too small a voice is given to African-American characters; for a book about capital punishment, too little attention is given to the deep roots of injustice; and in a book about the conventions of racism, the swampland of vile politics is not drained. Having both brains and spine, the main character does not need the lip.

It iThis is the book I am taking with me to recommend when I speak to library and museum groups, and it is one that I would ask my students to study. It is a fine reading experience, and it causes the reader to want more of Solnit's other diverse writings. This is not fiction, but the book has a compelling narrative, telling sequential stories of disasters -- floods, earthquakes, terrorist attacks, monstrous explosions -- from the humane, constructive side, where experiences are rarely recorded. And, it is in a sense an ""anti-fiction"" because the truths Solnit tells undermine the official responses to sudden devastation, especially those that suggest the worst about human nature. Each of her chapters addresses spontaneous human recovery in contrast to governmental malfeasance and lofty ignorance. (Think of New Orleans, Hurricane Katrina, and the inept arrogance of the Bush administration.) In all of these cases, Solnit finds that it is human altruism, crafted improvisation, and collective courage that leads to community survival in times of complete loss. ""In disaster we need an open society based on trust in which people are free to exercise their capacities for improvisation, altruism and solidarity. In fact, we need it all the time, only most urgently in disaster."" (p.127) As the second sentence in this quotation implies, this book is an articulation of human integrity and the basis for cooperation among strangers in times of necessity. In these settings, competition is not a useful part of the struggle to survive. Reclaiming humanity is required for that. ""What begins as opposition coalesces again and again into social invention, a revolution of everyday life rather than a revolt against the system."" (p.285) I want librarians to read this book particularly because it emphasizes the value of integrity, of leading a life in public fearlessly. Toward the end of the book, Solnit writes, ""It will require a world in which we are each other's wealth and have each other's trust. This world can be made possible only by the faith in social possibility that understanding ourselves in past disaster can give us and by the embeddedness in place and society that constitutes a sense of belonging."" (p.308) This tells of a collective heroism that evolving out of a dire challenge. The book reminds me that we require the same kinds of face-to-face claiming of our strength in the face of arbitrary political disasters and perversions of the democratic process. This is a book that expands our awareness of the human capacity for courage and self-definition in times of need. It stands against the elite assumption that people need to be saved from the chaos of themselves. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Aug 06, 2011","May 19, 2012","Aug 06, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6444492-a-paradise-built-in-hell

On nearly every pAgainst expectations, I read this book as rapidly as I could, following its inevitable word cadences, complex and exquisitely honed. On nearly every page I wanted to rush forward, but the structure and evolution of each crafted sentence kept me from it and taught me a reader's patience. In this way it is close to the first book of Cormac McCarthy's brilliant trilogy, so strong and compulsive. But in its own way, this book is more furious, darkened and storm-driven by a human hardness even McCarthy does not touch. As I read to the end early this morning, I recognized that it is Faulkner whose power is echoed in the prose, in the fabric of guilt and cruelty, and the inner chasms created by blood relationships. And so I was lost to it: if Faulkner had written about west Texas, he might have written this. Even taken up a second time, this book would run like a stallion, and I would struggle to hang on.From page 271: ""Fire was one of so many things that could render a man helpless, and now, as Karel reached the corral fence and circled around to the gate, his brothers' eyes unblinking and tepid and fixed on him, he reckoned that family was another. A man couldn't any more choose which one he was born into than he could will it to stay together when so many things abraded and raveled the fibers that were meant to keep it bound. Try to hold it all together with force, with a harness and a hard hand the way their father had, and it grew so thick with the cordage of resentment that you couldn't even get your hands around it."" ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Aug 06, 2011","Aug 07, 2011","Aug 06, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7743827-the-wake-of-forgiveness
