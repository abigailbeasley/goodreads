Catudal has such an amazing way with words, such an ability to put emotion into black and white letters that I often held my breath while reading. You can feel that she put herself fully into this story. She let us into her world, let’s us into her mind and experiences, and makes you feel through her words. And what powerful words: ***“I don’t run to be fit,” he once told me. “I mostly run to not hurt so much.”The nurse barely looked up from her computer as she typed his information, drained from an endless barrage of patients with similar ailments flooding into the overcrowded and understaffed hospital. Rivs was drowning on dry land, and so was she.Click. Silence. Loneliness. Oxygen. Lungs. Breath.More than anything, it was cathartic to list all the ways I’d defied god for saving those fishermen and not my father.You could spend your whole life waiting and never be prepared for the airlessness of tragedy.This was the thought that cut through the fog: my husband might die in silence because I couldn’t find the courage to speak up.They were simply doing what women have always done: hold worlds together in shadowed recognition.But life doesn’t work in weight and measure—there is no cap on pain. The bucket just gets bigger. Sometimes there is more grief than we feel we can handle—it overflows whatever pail we’ve used to catch the leak. It seeps out of us, onto the floors, up the walls, out the windows. For a little while, we drown. It’s dark. And then, the light shines through—weak at first, like the subtle smell of spring you can taste before you can see. You reach your hand up to see if it’s real. Light glows through your fingers. There it is, out of the abyss, gleaning in on the horizon: hope, healing, a way forward.They walked the tightrope between art and science. They believed. And it was beautiful. It was a miracle.***I feel lucky to have been able to glimpse this story and her life. What a amazing gift to share with everyone. Also, having heard of Rivs and remembering when this was happening in really time, there is something amazing in hearing of this time from this perspective. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jul 08, 2023","Jul 11, 2023","Jul 08, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/62365899-everything-all-at-once

The base story was intriguing but the timing of it, with Vonnegut and Mailer and everything that was the sixties, made the story into something too big, or trying to be too big. I feel like Sherman didn’t know where to let the bigger story go and focus on Costa. Perhaps that wasn’t enough of a story alone so he drew from other aspects of the world. But unlike the interwoven stories of Erik Larson this didn’t have the harmony of those books. There was also a clunky handling of how people identified themselves as Sherman told their stories. Referring to the people as the killer or the author took me out of their story and their heads. All in all, I read it quickly and wouldn’t have minded a shorted more focused tale. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"May 12, 2023","May 15, 2023","May 12, 2023",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/57693138-helltown

Part of that is the writing style- it is easy to digest and read quickly. This was one of the few books in recent memory that I read almost in a day. Part of that is the writing style- it is easy to digest and read quickly. Part of that was the story itself. I knew the end before the start, but I was reading to story quickly trying to see how (why?) that end happened.The thing about it all, and perhaps the thing about suicide always, there is not way to know why Madison jumped off the building. There is no way to know how much she struggled and for how long and in what ways. It is something that has no answers.Madison’s story is mixed in with both Kate Fagan’s own story, although she acknowledges that she never has the same struggles of Madison, and attempts to capture why Madison and others, may feel like they do at a time, 18 years old, first-year student in college, when everything is supposed to be new, bright, and amazing.The thing for me is that I can’t truly relate to Madison. I am lucky enough to not suffer this type of mental illness. I also adored college even when it was terrible (to the 22-year-old me). But there were aspects to this book, to Madison’s and other’s experiences, where I could see how the pressures could create an imbalance or be ""that thing"" that makes everything more.I mostly forget what it is like to be eighteen-nineteen, but I know I thought I knew everything and didn’t. As Fagan writes, “[k]nowing the difference between a hurdle and a brick wall is [] crucial-yet recognizing that difference is almost impossible when you’re eighteen years old.” This was speaking to the college athletic and the need or want to not quit because “one part of the minds says no more; the other part tells them they’re weak for saying no more.” But it's also just something that someone of that age carries with them. It can be hard not to feel like everything is so much worse than it is or, perhaps worse, to feel like something that is terrible and scary shouldn't be because it doesn't seem to be that way for everyone else so you just stay quiet and think there's something wrong with you.What also stuck me about the telling of Madison’s struggles is how akin to something haunting her and how “[l]iving with a ghost is frightening enough, but if you change houses to escape it and the ghost is present in the new space, then you’ve confirmed that it’s not the house that ghost is haunting. It's you” and how much she seemed to want to find a reason for this struggle. If she stopped running, that would fix it. If she transferred, that would fix it. I can’t imagine the terror that had to exist in her when she thought and reached out (so positively) about these options. And how, in the end, it wasn’t a solution. “[T]here on the horizon, looms another truth: depression and anxiety are not cured in a moment, with a single decision, thought sometimes it might feel as if they might be.”The last thing I’ll add to this is something about the title. “What Made Maddy Run.” At first, I thought the story would be about a young runner, who found everything she ever wanted in running and it made her who she was but didn’t defeat all her demons. It turns out, that wasn’t entirely the truth. Madison appears to have chosen running over soccer for some reason(s) that only she knows. She seemed to choose something that did not bring her happiness or joy (or perhaps the happiness and joy she thought it would other expected it would). Of course, there is no way to know what Madison thought or felt. Her story is told by others because there is no one else to tell her story. But trying to tell her story, trying to bring to light this struggle is, I think, the important take away. As with so many of these stories, we can never truly understand or know filly what another person is going through and sometimes you need to ask and reach out and try. You never know if you may help....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jun 20, 2022","Jun 26, 2022","Jun 17, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/33296283-what-made-maddy-run

That the Court, which I so often tried to defend and support, has made bad decisions in the past. And those decisions were overturned. I wanted to be reminded that people are so much more willing than me to take on these fights. I was reminded of both these things through these essays and taught new cases.

So often people take a view point on life's issues that they are the only person facing such difficulties, that no one can understand things they have to face, etc. And while that can certainly be true in extreme circumstance, I am focusing more on the people who are referring to normal job woes, normal daily frustrations.

He doesn't mince words often and he writes in a manner that is easy to digest.

You get to know Pino intimately but, especially upon reading the last chapter/epilogue you know that there is something you’ll never truly know about him. It is heart-breaking and stressful and, although you can’t change the truth, I had hoped Anna would survive. The what-if element haunts the reader as, it appears, it did and does Pino. Like nearly everyone in Europe, Pino was not saved from lose and there is a deeper element to that lose, somehow, know that Pino is still alive (or so I believe based on Google). To know he may still suffer these loses, while, I hope, celebrating his bravery and victories, makes the story not that much harder. This aspect of the War I was not as familiar about and it was interesting having a look into it.

The Happy Runner just puts a smile on your face from the very beginning acknowledging (and rightfully so) that it is somewhat of a corny and maybe cavity-inducing read you’ve signed up for. But while that holds true, I never found the book to be annoying in that regard. It was helpful, inspiring and, most importantly, happy. It made me look forward to running and thinking about it again whereas I had been a little off that train recently. I read it sort of like a self-help book, underlining and taking mental and physical notes. I found it helped focus me a bit about why I wanted to run, why I kept running and why I want to continue to run especially right now. It always gave me inspiration to still aim at those lofty goals but to not worry or struggle so much while along the way.I think what I most loved is that it’s clear the Roche’s mean everything they write.

I found that I really enjoyed this book and it had a good steady pace to it. There was a fun wit about the writing that, while not really laugh out loud funny, had me smiling nonetheless. The characters were all average despite the fact that certain aspects of their story being above-average and that made them really come to life for me. I found myself liking all of them despite many of their short comings and no one who was a major character struck me as a villain or a hero even. It was just that everyone was doing their best to survive.I think the only part that I am wavering about is the way everyone came together in the end and how everyone appeared healed. I found the last 80-100 pages having very well-written dialogue especially as Cyril came back into the lives of Alice and Charles, but I also felt that humor to be somewhat misplaced at times. I don’t know if I fully can feel the honesty in the fact that everyone somehow could forgive or at least forget what Cyril did when leaving Ireland. I entirely believe the fact no one may hate him for being homosexual but the humor with which his choices was embraced left me a little iffy. On the other hand, maybe there is something to be said about how each person can let go and forgive and find joy in what is left behind.

What I really enjoyed about the book was the shift in narrative both of character and time. It was a very engaging way to get to know how the characters interacted and to worry for them as the world, essentially, ended. I also both liked and didn’t like how moly some character, post virus, had names while some were simply viola or tuba. I liked that they sort of represented just a generic survivor but still had a unique position post-virus. It allowed you to wonder if you could have been that person or one of the many victims.There was also a haunting beauty in the book and how the end of described. A key example was the description of plane that never unloaded their passengers and those simple sentences that allowed the mind to wander what happened in the plane when that decision was made. What happened all over the place when the end came?I think my one complaint was that I expected a more startling explanation of how some survivors lives were tied together and did find that a little anticlimactic. That being said, I also DID like the fact that it kind of was simple and there was nothing too special about those whose, perhaps, just got lucky but they were somehow able to have a connection in this new world.Lastly, I enjoyed the ending. It sparked hope but not guaranteed. There is still just survival always present but the book ends with aspiration. There’s an old tv show that I loved which starts its epilogue at the end of the series with “And life continued” which is just how this books ends.

I am totally fine cutting a run short for a dinner or going to it a little late. I’ll stay in because I just don’t want to commit to something. I clean but it’s a rental so... All in all I think it worth the time and is a book you can put down and pick up as you like. It may offer you some feelings (especially if you are a woman) of not being alone in many feelings but it’s not really a self help book (nor is it sold as one) but good information and research. You can tell a lot of time, effort and love went into it. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Nov 25, 2018","Jan 14, 2019","Nov 17, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17934399-overwhelmed

I think most of that stems from the fact that I picked up this book wanting to read about Quenton Cassidy’s running career and it felt like it too a long time to get to where I finally felt the pace (pun intended) pick up. Once it did, which to me was around 150 pages or so, I enjoyed the book similarly to “Once a Runner.”One of the things that I love the most about this book is the actual kind of failure that Cassidy has in his running career. He is a Silva medalist, gets thirds and can’t go back to the Olympics. He is just that one step shy of utter greatness, while still amazing great of course. And it never seems to me that he is entirely upset by that. This book is geared towards that one last chance and he does succeed even while coming just short. To me, that speaks a lot about things I’ve done (although not one the same scale). I’ve been good at sports of endeavors, but never quite the gold medalist. I work hard and succeed but there is always the chance I could have had more. I like that Cassidy is talented and hardworking, but still just not the victor. I also loved that this was about tackling a marathon. I quite honestly just finished one two weeks ago in which I fell two minutes short of my Boston Qualifying goal. I put in work and it didn’t happened but I am content. I loved reading about the agonies of the race because I can still feel it. “No one really wins a marathon. You just survive in better” is an amazing truthful statement and I think “winning” can simply mean what it means to you. There are two paragraphs that I honestly experienced while running my last last. As a runner pulls again Cassidy thinks:LAnd this really is it...as he tried to pick up his pace at least a little, to give some semblance of a fight, some gesture of defiance. But it was completely, utterly, depressingly hopeless, and he knew it. He knew it because ever since the twenty-mile mark when he has first felt himself beginning to come apart at the seams, he had realized something so fundamental, so surprising, that he knew he would never be the same again. He had finally found the ultimate limits to himself...just past the twenty-mile mark is this too long race.lThere is a time in which every marathoner falls apart but it matters how much you fall apart as to the true loss. I’ve been there twice and the second time was less harsh. I expect the third to also be less harsh and so it goes. That is the nature of a race like this and I think this book, in the last 150 pages, takes great care to paint that picture. As it was also said, “no matter how good or bad a runner looks towards the end of a race, the thing he wants most in the world is to stop.”What I like about this book and “Once” is that it takes the ugly and hard side of running and makes it both accessible to the non-runner and an inside joke to the runner. You understand Cassidy maybe a little better if you can picture the races and training he does and I appreciate that aspect of the book. I appreciate being kind of “in the know” and fundamentally understating some of the scope of his world that Parker has created....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,Feb 2018,"Nov 04, 2018","Nov 03, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2124589.Again_to_Carthage

This time of year can seem so daunting and then, when you read something like this about Alaska and what it must be like, it makes you wonder how people exist and thrive up there.The Great Alone was a very quick read for me. One, because I have a long weekend and, two, because it just does read fast. There is a lot to the story, but also not a lot. There are no real surprises, I felt like and, in many ways the story was very simple. But I think that's also one of the things I liked about it. The characters and their complexities while overwhelming in this narrative would not seem so complex in another setting. I think it is the loneliness and the vastness of Alaska as the backdrop that makes the story standout more.The relationship of Leni and Matthew, in many other worlds, would seem naive and juvenile, but in a land where they are literally the only two of that age, it makes sense in its intensity and survival. The blanket of anxiety and stress with the Allbright family is intensified given the remoteness of their lives. The setting makes everything in this story more and, without Alaska, I wonder how much I would have enjoyed the book.I did have two quotes that I really liked and wanted to save:""There's a saying: Up here you can make one mistake. The second one will kill you.""I enjoyed how this came back a multitude of times. Sometimes living up to the fact that the second mistake does kill you and other times showing some forgiveness.""Now Leni was old enough to know that, like all fairy tales, theirs was filled with thickets and dark places and broken dreams, and runaway girls.""As such is life but I think there's another quote from an author that I always think of when stories tend to drive away fairy tales which is: ""one day you will be old enough for fairy tales.""

I took some time to write the  because I anted to think about the book aIt has been a long time since I’ve read a book that simply spoke to me. I took some time to write the  because I anted to think about the book a bit more. And in talking about the books with other people I realized that it just simply struck a personal cord with me. Quenton Cassidy’s focus, love and explanation of running resonated with me even though I am not a competitive runner (nor was I ever) of that caliber. But his love and focus of the sport, and Parker’s words to describe these feelings was just spot on. This was a book that I could not put down despite it not being a thriller or mystery where you want to know what happens next. I, of course, wanted to know what would happen in that final race, but my inability to put it down was based on how badly I wanted to find myself nodding along with a description of running, of racing, of competition and many other things. It was like someone took all the thoughts I’ve had about running (or even frisbee) and put a voice to them that worked. The book is clearly from the perspective of someone who has logged countless miles in a multitude of situations and found something about yourself each time even if you didn’t necessarily know it at the time. What I liked or what drew me in the most was the separation between Cassidy’s views which were often comical or focused but from the perspective of the runner while it was happening. You had Cassidy offer, what I thought were, charming tidbits about running: “This isn’t so bad, Cassidy thought, I’m just dying is all.” “This gentlemen...is 27:42, also known as 13:12, I believe.” “‘An interval workout,’ Cassidy once explained to a sportswriter, ‘is the distance runner’s equivalent of the once popular Iron Madien.’” And then you had Parker write something more akin to reflections of the sport: “The race itself was bearable, for that they had trained. The waiting, however, was hell on square wheels.” “...Cassidy locked into a steady pace, allowing his mind to slip into the pleasant half-conscious neutral state that all runner’s develop; he was soon lost in the cool gray isolation of fog.” “The runner deals nearly daily in the absolutes of physical limitation...[f]leeing from an armed killer...a layman soon will find the frightening limits...[t]he runner knows such boundaries like he knows the sidewalks of his own neighborhood.” “The other runner would response and soon they would be flying around the worn path, racing different phantoms front the past.” “They were poised there on the edge of some howling vortex they had run ten thousand miles to get to. Now they had to run one more.”Now, I will freely admit that sometimes Parker gets a little intense with describing things and it could be taken as too much and trying too hard. But what I think I get from it instead is not a writer trying to write about running but a runner tying to write about running. And, believe me, at times when you are out there fighting for something that seems to matter only to you, the way Parker describes the fight and battle with yourself and maybe others seems as dramatic as the words he uses. I think the overuse of language in the book is because it can be hard to explain what it feels like to stand on a track knowing all the work and sacrifice you made for this one moment that, in a matter of minutes literally, will be lost by so many. Sometimes that race it the most important moment for you and to try and convey that to someone who hasn’t stood there in any sense or in any sport is hard. I think Parker tried to aim towards the community that would “get it” and lost some of those along the way.I for one though really enjoyed the book and recommend it for all but especially my running friends. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jan 04, 2018","Jan 15, 2018","Jan 04, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/98250.Once_a_Runner

I picked this book justThis was only my second full listening of an audible book and I decided to give it a try because I'm doing a lot of long runs. I picked this book just by chance because I love dinosaurs and have enjoyed Michael Crighton's creations (although I've only ever saw them and haven't read any of his before). I would give this book a 3.5-3.7 rating. It was a good paced book with interesting fictional characters (a main character who was a little two dimensional but grew on me) interacting with real life people. I enjoy that Bill Johnson's story intersects with Marsh and Cope, two people who's place in paleontology is as interesting as it is bizarre. Plus you get some Earp brothers. I enjoyed the paleontology side of the story as these huge discoveries were being made but only a few truly cared. It even Johnson truly understood why he cared even, perhaps, in the end. The book also paints that picture of the west that I find so fascinating and one that I wish I could see if only for a moment.As an audible book I think I also found it to be somewhat better paced than if I was reading. If reading I wonder if I may have felt it would draw on in some parts but, for me, I just kept running regardless and it was better than focusing on that. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jul 06, 2017","Jul 28, 2017","Jul 30, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/31287693-dragon-teeth

I think I picked up this book after reading a list of good fantasy or horror books. I forget what it was that drew me in, but I’m glad it did.The book goes by fast which I think has a lot to do with Hawkins’s writing style. It is accessible and, even with vast characters, easy to follow. He sort of drops you in the middle of the story or world he’s created, but answers the questions either through the story itself or just far enough along that you aren’t lost.I found his dialogue funny too. I am not sure if everyone would share in that sentiment with me, but I think his humor was pretty spot on and a good balance with the gore and horror aspects to the story. Everything in this story is so normal seeming to many despite how not normal it all is and that comes across. Hawkins created an oddly believable storyline that is straight-up odd, but did so with such easy I didn’t question it.There were some aspects that I found perhaps a bit trite I suppose. The fact that somehow Carolyn felt something for Steve or some of the sex aspect between characters but most of that didn’t not get so much in the way, as it were, that it took away from my overall enjoyment of the book.All in all, a unique story that I really enjoyed and would recommend....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Nov 09, 2018","Nov 12, 2018","Jun 03, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/26892110-the-library-at-mount-char

I found the mystery to be somewhat intriguing as the murders that occur seem to happen for no reason and the pieces slowly fall into place with links being connected all over the place in the last 90 pages. What I didn’t necessarily enjoy were the smaller mysteries surrounding the main characters. The Sara and Anna story as well as Soren’s past were unnecessary I felt and, I think, were meant to bring the reader closer with these characters. I found it didn’t manage to do that and, in the end, I never connected or felt much for any of the players in this book.

I enjoyed the story and meeting the characters plus the plot moved quickly. I did find having the narrator as a 15 year old boy might have made he book a little less engaging and sometimes I felt like the author had a hard time grasping how young versus old he wanted the character to be. It didn't take away from the book but I think it didn't make me compelled to continue to see what happens to the characters. Because of reference to WWII (I don't want to give spoilers) I did find this passage very compelling and found the author had other gems of writing throughout but I had hoped for more at times but things usually stayed a little superficial.""I cried harder. I didn't want to, but I couldn't stop myself. I couldn't stop myself, so I thought about all the bad things and I fed it and fed it until I was crying so hard I had to gasp for breath between sobs. I thought about how my great grandparents had starved to death. I thought about their wasted bodies being fed into incinerators because people they didn't know hated them. I thought about how the children who lived in this house had been burned up and blown apart because the pilot who didn't care pushed a button.""Still overall a good book and worth the time....more",Notes are private!,0,0,2,"Jun 05, 2017not set","Jun 10, 2017not set","Aug 14, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9460487-miss-peregrine-s-home-for-peculiar-children

Upon reading I was underwhelmed by it but I think that may have been more with personal choice than the story. I found the unknown narrator (author) to be someone I couldn't relate to.
