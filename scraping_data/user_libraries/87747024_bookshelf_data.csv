I wish that I was able to finish this faster, but I got so caught up with school that I found it hard to find time to read. It did not help that I was not particularly interested in the plot and that the book was so slow.I went into this book with high expectations because it seemed like something that I would like, but it was definitely not my cup of tea, mostly because I found the plot to be soo boring. I liked the characters enough and the beginning of the book set up for an intriguing story, but I began losing interest like halfway through. I did not find this book to be particularly scary or have any kind of crazy plot twist. I thought that when the plot picked up I would enjoy it, but that was not the case. I did enjoy the writing style of the book and I feel like if the plot was more interesting to me, I would have loved this book. I think that even though I did not like this book, I will definitely pick something by this author up again. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Aug 20, 2023","Nov 23, 2023","Aug 13, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53152636-mexican-gothic

What a useless word, in a world with magic.”I have really mixed feelings about this book. Honestly, I'm not even sure what rating I will give it. Usually, I like the second book better than the first in a series, but I felt pretty meh about this one. I was excited going into it, and the beggining was promising, but as the story progressed, I just started becoming disappointed.The characters are hard to connect to. Like I read in another , they are all very stereotypical and flat. The plot was promising at the begging, but it started dragging on until the last like 25 pages. The games were boring and I felt as if they were a useless and lazy addition to the plot. At the end of the book, things started to pick up, but it was (view spoiler)[ still really similar to the first book, just a couple of different details. I also don't really understand where the relationship between Kell and Lila came from. I also don't understand where Rhy and Alucard came from (was it in the first book?? I don't even remember.) Also, who is Okja and where did she come from?) (hide spoiler)] It just felt like a lot of random things were thrown into the book, making it seem a little one-dimensional.All in all, this series hasn't really impressed me. The writing is ok.

The writing was amazing from the beginning. However, as I read, the plot felt like it was dragging on. Although the writing kept me reading, I feel like the book lacked any direction. I really enjoyed the chapters where Ingrid was writing, but the ones with Flora and Nan weren't as interesting to me. The end felt underwhelming and predictable, but I see what the author was trying to do. It just wasn't for me. I kind of enjoyed it, but I wouldn't read it again.

My body was built to wage war.”My last book of 2022!! This was an excellent year, but not for my reading :(. This book was a great way to end it though. TJR does not disappoint.The beginning really captivated me. I wanted to see how the story would play out and I was really invested in Carrie. The middle began to feel a bit repetitive, so that was when I started having trouble picking up the book. However, the end was perfect. (view spoiler)[ I loved that she was able to get a big win, but still not ultimately win against Chan at the end. I loved how everything turned out and how her relationships evolved throughout the story (hide spoiler)] Her relationship with her father was definitely my favorite part. (view spoiler)[ I predicted he would die, but his death still caught me off guard. It was so sad :( (hide spoiler)]Hopefully, I can read more in 2023. My reading tastes have evolved, and I think I better understand them now, so hopefully, I can read with some purpose and find some great new books.

The cracks are the best part. You don’t have to hide them.”I am so sad that I finished this book. I thoroughly enjoyed every second of it. This book is like a combination of A Little Life and Conversations with Friends, two of my all-time favorite books. I first discovered this book on Instagram and read the sample for it while trying to decide which books to bring with me on vacation. I really wanted to keep reading, so I bought it (best decision). This book is fairly new and so underrated. If you see this  and you love any Sally Rooney book or A Little Life, then stop everything you are doing and buy this book right now. Each chapter focused on a different character, and I loved reading about every single character. There wasn't a single character that I wasn't bored of while reading this. However, my favorite chapters were probably Eleanor's and Zoe's. This book made me laugh out loud and almost cry several times. The writing was impactful while also interesting and humorous. (view spoiler)[I also loved the way it ended, it really reminded me of Conversations with Friends.  (hide spoiler)]This is only a debut book so I am so excited to see what the author creates in the future!! I stalked her Instagram and it seems like she based Cleo on herself.

Although it was slow, that was what I really enjoyed about it. I loved learning about such an unlikeable character and her life. I’ve never read through a point of view like this one.This book is mostly character-driven, but it does have some interesting plot points that allured me into reading more and more. Besides the narrator, the characters were also very interesting and contributed to a rich story. The writing was phenomenal. As I was reading this on the beach, I was still transported to the icy cold winter in X-Ville. I also loved that it was told from the perspective of an older Eileen. I would totally read the next book if this was a series. Highly recommend!!...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"May 18, 2023","Jun 03, 2023","Oct 30, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23453099-eileen

I had high expectations after watching Gone Girl because I thought the concept was interesting and I wanted to see what other stories the author could come up with. I thought the concept of this story was interesting and the writing was good, but I just didn't enjoy the way the plot played out. It felt really slow and even though I was making progress in the book, it felt like nothing had happened. I also had a hard time connecting to any of the characters and immersing myself in the plot/atmosphere of the story. I thought Camille was well written though. (view spoiler)[ I feel like I saw the ending coming because it was obvious from the beginning and I was a bit disappointed since many people in the s for the book claimed it was this big plot twist that caught them off guard.

I feel like I keep reading the same thing over and over again and I don't enjoy the romances too much.

I will be coming back to this series in a while because I need a longgg break from it. I miss the old Aelin and the earlier books in the series were way better and I miss Adarlan as the main setting to the story.

I have been so busy these past couple of months, but I have finally found some time to read.This book was a pleasant surprise. I picked it up on a whim, and I ended up really enjoying the story. I thought that the writing was decent and that the characters were developed and well thought out. Ivy was a really interesting character and I really enjoyed reading from her point of view. The side characters were also interesting to read and learn about. I thought all the characters added to the story, which made it really interesting. The plot was interesting, although I think it dragged a bit at some points. I think it could have been more interesting if there were more plot twists throughout the story because I felt like I was just reading about events that were leading up to the inevitable.

I really understood what was going on in Maria's head and Didion did a good job of detailing what its really like to feel like you're losing your mind. It's like she was able to write out emotions that I know I have felt before but was never able to articulate in the same way that Didion did in this book.Although I thought the writing was phenomenal, I had a hard time following the plot and understanding other characters' relationships to Maria, so it made it less of an enjoyable read for me. However, I am glad I read it, and look forward to reading more by Joan Didion in the future because of her writing style. I recommend if you're looking for something different!rip joan didion<3 ...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Dec 23, 2021","Jan 12, 2022","Aug 11, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/428.Play_It_As_It_Lays

Will you remember that I existed, and that I stood next to you here like this?”Wow.. this is definitely one of those books that will stay with me for the rest of my life. The writing in this was absolutely phenomenal and the characters were so complex. The way that Murakami portrayed grieving in this book through his prose really got through to me, and especially towards the end of the book, I felt like I was right there, grieving with Toru.  I was always hungry for love. Just once, I wanted to know what it was like to get my fill of it – to be fed so much love I couldn't take any more. This book reminded me a bit of Sally Rooney's work (if it was written from the pov of a perverted man maybe?? lol) and even though nothing really happened in the book, I was always so immersed in it and I wanted to keep reading. When Toru was looking back on his memories with Naoko, I felt like I was looking back with him which really added to the book for me because it gave me a glimpse into exactly how he was feeling. I also loved Midori and I thought she was so relatable in a couple of ways. “I've had enough hurt already in my life. More than enough. Now I want to be happy.”The one thing about this book that REALLY bothered me was the way that the women were written. I saw a couple of s before reading the book about it, but I wanted to see for myself. I definitely agree that the way women were portrayed in this book was a bit problematic, especially some scenes in the book (and i did not like any of the vulgar sex scenes. they were awkward and i guess i just hated reading it from a mans pov). It would be a 5 star favorite if it wasn't for that, but I can't really look past them since they were such a prominent part of the story. (view spoiler)[ I also felt like I was able to predict the end a bit?? A majority of the characters seemed to kill themselves at the end, so it kind of clicked in my head that Naoko would kill herself at the end, but I didn't know how else the story would have ended. (hide spoiler)]I have a million things to talk to you about. All I want in this world is you. I want to see you and talk. I want the two of us to begin everything from the beginning.^^this quote makes me meltOverall, I recommend this book.

As I'm writing this , I'm debating on the rating (might change it??). Because this is Sally Rooney, I feel inclined to give it 5 stars because I am so obsessed with her writing. However, I feel like this book is my least favorite out of the two I've read by her (though they are tough competition to beat bcs I absolutely ADORE them). The sole reason is probably the lack of plot in this one (in comparison to the other two). The other two barely had plot in them either but I feel like this one had even less. This book is definitely more mature than the other two and I enjoyed all the pretentiousness in Alice and Eileen's email exchanges. I thought it was very interesting to read about. The writing in this was beautiful as always. So many beautiful quotes that I have annotated. I think it's really fascinating that Rooney tried to embody herself through Alice's character. I really loved Elieen and I related to her so much. She is probably my favorite Sally Rooney character!! Like how is this woman my literal clone?? How are we thinking the same specific thoughts?? I loved her relationship with Simon so much and I'm happy with how it turned out. I thought Alice's and Felix's relationship was interesting but I liked it and I think it worked well for both of their characters. I love that this is the book I finished in 2022 because I feel like it really sets the tone for the year and my mindset about it: how beautiful life is no matter what is happening because of the people around you that you love and just the fact that you have the ability to just love and care about them no matter what. I think that it is so beautiful.

We all secretly hope that tragedy will only ever happen to other people... sooner or later, it happens to youThis book was quite a ride... and I loved every second of it. I had high expectations with this book, since Silent Patient was so good, and I was not disappointed. I could not put the book down. Michealides' plot twists are to die for. I love the psychological aspect of this book and because of it, I felt more connected to the characters. I was coming up with theories left and right but I still did not manage to figure out how it would end. (view spoiler)[ There were so many red herrings thrown into the book! I thought I knew who the killer was so many times and the revelation that it was Zoe/Sebastian shocked me! I found myself falling in love with Sebastian and Marianna's relationship and it's tragic ending struck a note with me.  (hide spoiler)]I loved this book and all the detail that went into it.

How badly they need it, and how little most of them will ever get.”This book was very eerie, and disgusting at times, but intriguing. I do not know much about the Manson murders, but I wanted to learn more, and this gave me a little insight into what really happened. I really liked the way that this was written. There were many beautiful lines that contemplated girlhood and coming of age that I loved. There were many interesting points in the plot and I liked reading about the contrast with how Evie's home life was evolving vs her life at the ranch. I thought that Evie's attachment to Suzanna was intriguing as well. Although the plot was fast-paced and exciting, I felt as if it quickened very abruptly and that it would have made more sense if the author delved deeper into the characters, more specifically Suzanna and the other girls. I feel like it would have given the story dimension. I wish we learned more about the motives and how the cult really started, instead of the muddled explanation that we were given. I also would have loved to learn more about Evie's family, more specifically her grandmother and her mother. I feel like this could have created some crucial turning points in Evie's character. Overall, I would definitely recommend this book. It is super interesting and fast-paced. The prose is also great. I will be reading more of the author's books....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Aug 16, 2023","Aug 19, 2023","Jun 29, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/26893819-the-girls

It’s a terrible feeling, the pain of not being loved.”Wow, this was such an amazing book!! I was hooked from the beginning and it was hard to put the book down. I really enjoyed most of it and I really like how the story was woven together, creating a really shocking ending. When it dawned on me, I was so shocked. The ending was so good!!! (view spoiler)[ I really liked how we got to read about Theo's relationship and learn about Alice at the same time. It made me more interested in the plot. (hide spoiler)] This book also had many interesting things about psychology that I enjoyed reading about and resonated with me. The characters were well developed, but they weren't really that memorable. The plot basically carried the whole book, and even though I'm more of a character-based book person, I still really enjoyed reading it.

I honestly don't even remember half of what happened in the book since there was so little plot. The tv show just adds so much more dimension to the story.

I had a good time reading it, but it definitely isn't my favorite one out of the rest of the books in the series. I started reading this series around a year ago, and since then I think I have definitely outgrown this series a lot, but I still enjoyed this book. The beginning was extremely slow and I did not think I would have been able to get through the whole book. However, the plot began to speed up eventually and I started to have a really good time reading it. Nesta is definitely one of my all-time favorite characters and her growth throughout this book was definitely my favorite part. This past year I have gone through a lot (hence my huge reading slump) and reading a lot of how Nesta dealt with what she went through and how she grew from it really resonated with me, especially with the point that I am in my life right now. I am so happy for her and that she finally got the happy ending she deserved!!Nesta and Cassian definitely do not live up to Feyre and Rhysand for me, but they definitely had their moments. Speaking of Feyre and Rhysand, I definitely did not enjoy them as much as I did in the other books, but that also may just be me and my love for angst, which they definitely don't really have anymore. (view spoiler)[I found the whole baby storyline to be a bit ridiculous and random but it was cute at the end I guess. I just wish the end centered more around Nesta, Gwyn, and Emerie maybe. The climax of the book was also very underwhelming because I though Cassian died but somehow he very easily tricked Briyallin or whatever her name was. Also underwhelming: the mate reveal (hide spoiler)] (view spoiler)[The smut in this book was definitely very good, and I am not complaining, but I feel like I would have preferred less of those and more of actual plot, which is just a personal preference. I really enjoyed the parts where Nesta, Cassian, and Azriel went to Oorid and reading about the Blood Rite and I wish there were more scenes like that. Loved the smut, but definitely could've gone without so much of it because it started to feel very repetitive at one point.  (hide spoiler)]Nesta, Gwyn, and Emeri's friendship were also one of my favorite parts of the book!! They are all such well-written characters and I am so happy that they got to grow so much together. I can't wait to see more of them in the book (view spoiler)[and definitely Mor and Emerie!! And where are Gwyn and Azriel coming from?? I keep seeing edits of them but they interacted like once in the book I think?? (hide spoiler)] This  is a little all over the place, but overall, I enjoyed a lot of the book and I love love love all the characters. I am intrigued to see where the next book goes, especially with Eris, because that's definitely something to explore. I definitely am not sure where the plot towards the future book is headed, but I am excited to see. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Mar 06, 2021","May 20, 2021","Mar 06, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53138095-a-court-of-silver-flames

You were brave because of your fear, not in spite of it.”I so badly wanted to love this book, but I didn't. I was blown away by The Nightingale, but this book felt underdeveloped and repetitive. The beginning was promising. I was intrigued from the outset of the story, but as the book progressed, I began losing interest. When they were still living in Texas, I felt like I was just reading about the dust storms and boring chores they did all day. There wasn't much plot to the book, (view spoiler)[even when they left to go to California. (hide spoiler)] I was excited for this progression in the plot, but the book still continued to be repetitive. Every romance and character in this book felt underdeveloped. I couldn't really connect to anyone in the story (except for Elsa, I think she was written pretty decently). I wasn't really rooting for any (romantic) relationship. However, I did like reading about the relationship between Elsa and Loreda. I thought it was complex and it definitely evolved from the beginning of the book. (view spoiler)[ The end was actually pretty good and it pulled on some heartstrings, but still, very rushed and underdeveloped. (hide spoiler)](view spoiler)[ I was not a big fan of Jack, solely for the fact that he was just too ""perfect"". He came into the book out of nowhere and was an extremely flat character. I did not care for his relationship with Elsa at all. (hide spoiler)]I think the plot could have been much better. I can say that I definitely learned more about this time in history, but the story and characters fell flat. I had high expectations for this novel, but they were not met. Would not recommend the book if looking for something as good as Hannah's preceding novel. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Dec 12, 2021","Dec 24, 2021","Feb 01, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53138081-the-four-winds

I seriously cannot remember giving a book more than 3 stars in so long and I think it's that I just expect too much from books because of the hype they get. Starting with the positives, I really liked some of the writing in this book. It wasn't anything special but there were definitely very many memorable quotes. I loved reading about Lily in her diary and (view spoiler)[ learning about her relationship with Atlas. I wasn't too fond of her relationship with Ryle, even from the beginning. I felt like they lacked chemistry and I already really disliked Ryle. Obviously, he became really bad towards the end and I could not stand him. I am so happy that she divorced him and that it ended with the beginning of Atlas' and Lily's relationship. When Ryle hit her for the first time, it definitely came as a shock because I wasn't even expecting it, especially after hearing about her past.  (hide spoiler)] I don't think any of the characters were very developed or memorable, and at times the whole thing seemed a bit unrealistic, but there were many moments when I could not wait to turn the next page to see what would happen.

I loved the way the ending was written and I definitely recommend it. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jun 20, 2021","Jun 28, 2021","Dec 23, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/27362503-it-ends-with-us

And she had long known that assholes protect their own. They are faithful to no one but surprisingly protective of each other.”I was so excited about this because I have loved all of Reid's previous books that I have read, and this one did not disappoint! It definitely isn't my favorite out of the three that I have read, but I definitely enjoyed myself while reading it. My favorite part about this book was the flashbacks and reading about June and Mick's relationship. I found the present-day plot to be a little bit underwhelming, especially at the climax of the story. I also found all the different people that were introduced during the party to be a bit confusing because I couldn't really keep up with who was who. This story was a fun summer read, but it definitely doesn't compare to Reid's other books I have read. I think this story would've been more interesting if it didn't take place within a day because it definitely made the plot feel a bit anti-climatic and I feel like there were so many things to explore with the characters that could've made the book that much better. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jun 06, 2021","Jun 11, 2021","Sep 22, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55404546-malibu-rising

I literally devoured it in two days. I could not stop reading and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, nearly falling off towards the end. This is not what I expected from Colleen Hoover after reading It Ends With Us and I think I like her books like this way more. The writing was simple, but the plot was so captivating. It felt predictable, but for some reason, I was still shocked at the end. (view spoiler)[ I did not see that letter at the end coming tho!! (hide spoiler)]. Lowen was an interesting character and I enjoyed reading from her point of view. I feel all of the characters had a lot of depth, and I lowkey wish I had learned more about Jeremy because I feel like the whole novel revolved more around Verity and Lowen even though Jeremy was a crucial part. I really love how she formatted the book with chapters from Verity's book. I was so excited to keep on reading her chapters because I was dying to know what really happened. (view spoiler)[ My only complaint is that although the ending shocked me, it still felt a little underwhelming (More so the part where Jeremy killed Verity). I would've loved to see the interaction between Verity, Lowen, and Jeremy but she was already dead before that could happen. And what about April? Was she in on it too? So many questions.

Kya laid her hand upon the breathing, wet earth, and the marsh became her mother.”This was one of the most stunning books I have ever read. The writing was so beautiful and unlike anything I have ever read. I really felt like I was in the marsh with Kya the whole time and I could imagine the world she created for herself in my head. I loved reading all the details in the book, and contrary to popular belief, I never felt bored while reading the book. Kya is one of my favorite characters that I have ever read about. There was so much to her and every time she felt something, I felt it too. She was so multi-dimensional and felt so real. (view spoiler)[ I thought that the ending was perfect. Although it seemed obvious to me, I thought that there wouldn't have been any other way to end it (and the poems!!!) I can't wait to reread it from a different point of view.

Lei was a boring main character and I wish that her relationship with her mother was explored more. I loved the idea of Wren and Lei's relationship, but I felt like it was rushed (maybe that's just me and my love for slowburn), but I could definitely see how this book could be really enjoyable for someone else.

I knew it would happen at one point or another but all of it happened so fast and caught me off guard. Don't even get me started on Aelin coming back as Celeana to sneak into the kingdom. I was smiling so hard at that part. She is SO CLEVER. I am also so glad Dorian is back to normal. I missed him so much in this book, he deserves so much better!!

I loved meeting all the new characters and watching the old ones develop into different people than they were before. I feel like the plot was a bit slower in this book than in Crown of Midnight, which I think I enjoyed a bit more than this book. There wasn't as much romance, but more of plot and character development. This book was more about healing for the characters than anything. I feel as if all of the characters went through at least one big change throughout the whole book. I liked hearing about Celeana's history and learning more about who she was. She processed a lot of grief, and it wasn't easy for her. It was rough and difficult. She has changed a lot since the first book, and you can really see that in this book. I liked a lot of the new characters that were introduced, especially Manon. She was so fearless and brave, and I really enjoyed the chapters about her. The plot in this book was a little slow. Basically everyone in this book was training for something, and Chaol and Dorian just had their usual rebel drama back in Adarlan. The plot began to really speed up towards the end, which was a big contrast from the slow first 3/4s of the book. (view spoiler)[ I definitely hate the King of Adarlan even more throughout each book. Can't wait for Celeana to kill him! I was at the edge of my seat at the end of the book, when Scorscha was killed and Dorian started using his powers on the king.

So beautifully written, and the more I think about it, it is definitely one of my favorites. This book felt like it was about nothing, but everything at the same time. It is definitely unlike anything I have ever read. The writing was absolutely beautiful and reading about Marianne and Connell's relationship was interesting and I thought at times, VERY romantic (I think they might be one of my favorite couples I have ever read about but I think I am also crazy). The way that they understood each other in a way no one else could, and the way that they felt/acted together really resonated with me for some reason. A lot of the story felt really relatable (especially their pretentiousness. oops.) and I just adored the way Sally Rooney worded the way that Connell and especially Marianna felt. I wasn't a fan of the ending, but I can see how it makes sense to the story. This is a very real book, and I can see why someone wouldn't like it, but I enjoyed reading most of it and I think that many parts of the book were beautiful.

This was truly incredible, a literal masterpiece. The writing is absolutely beautiful and the way that the plot conveys the message of the story is absolutely immaculate.Addie LaRue makes a Faustian bargain with a devil to become immortal, but at the cost of being forgotten by everyone she meets. She is erased from the lives of her family and friends, but free of the constraints that they bound her to. She is able to travel the world and live the way she had always wished to. “Don't you remember, she told him then, when you were nothing but shadow and smoke?Darling, he'd said in his soft, rich way, I was the night itself.”The writing of this book was certainly amazing. Every chapter had a purpose and at least one memorable quote. This book showed how grief, joy, happiness, anger, jealousy, sorrow, love, and so many more emotions are all apart of living a fulfilled life. It showed that life is perfect because it is not perfect. That the moments of sorrow just make the moments of joy even better. All she knows is that she is tired, and he is the place she wants to rest. And that, somehow, she was happy. But it is not love.The different romantical aspects of this book were done so well. With Addie being able to experience a kind of love she never got to have, but also coming back to the comfort of the love that she had always had. The build-up between Addie's relationship with (view spoiler)[Luc (hide spoiler)] was so well done. I thought that their relationship was so well written and intricate. Her relationship with (view spoiler)[Henry (hide spoiler)] was bittersweet, but I loved it as well. Not as angsty, but refreshing, and the kind of love she deserved after all those years.As I mentioned before, I feel like the magical aspect of this book helped convey the message of the story even better. The fact that Addie made a deal with a devil to live forever, shows that even though she saw many great places and did live a fulfilling life, the one thing she wanted to be was remembered. (view spoiler)[Through Henry's deal, I was able to see how love's imperfections make it real. I will definitely remember when he was sitting with Bea, and she told him that you can't make someone love you. To be real, it has to be a choice that you make. (hide spoiler)]I definitely recommend this book!! This book may not be for everyone, but it is just the kind of book that I find to be perfect.

Although the books aren't the best, they are comfortable to read because they are so predictable and simple.I know this is an unpopular opinion, but I feel as if I enjoyed these last two books a bit more than the first three. I liked Eadlyn far more than America, because I feel like she actually grew throughout the book and was worried about many more things than just finding love, which made her much more complex. The way a book is written usually isn't a problem for me, but I feel like the author was a bit in over her head on this one. She used so many strange similes that sometimes I just cringed. The writing is simple and fairly easy to understand, but some things just had me thinking, 'Why?'.I was also happy to see more stuff going around in the world instead of the book just being centered around the romance. It made the plot a bit better and it was more interesting to read about all the different dynamics in their country, especially showing how even though they got rid of the castes, that wasn't the sole solution to fixing all the problems in their country.Although I feel the romance was a bit underdeveloped and the person she ended up with isn't exactly the person that I wanted her to end up with, it was still less predictable than who America ended up with, which I appreciated. However, in terms of romance, I liked America and Maxon's relationship more than who Eadlyn ended up with because I feel like the person Eadlyn ended up with was a bit random. Maxon and America were so cute in this book though!!Overall, this series isn't anything mind-blowing and amazing, its pretty mediocre. However, its a comfortable read and if you're looking to destress, I would certainly recommend this book because it is simple, safe, and predictable....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jul 17, 2020","Jul 21, 2020","Jun 14, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/26074181-the-crown

There were so many twists at the end that really had me hooked and I enjoyed the book a bit more than the first two.In this book, America became more concrete on who she wanted to choose- Aspen or Maxon. I found the going back and forth to be annoying so I am glad that she finally chose. She also started playing more of an active role in their society and trying to better it. The Convicting was also a big reason why I began to like America a bit, I think what she did was super generous and showed how much she actually cared about making their country better.

I was really upset that Celeste died because I feel like she had so much potential to be an amazing character. I was also really upset about the queen's death and I wish that only the king died. I feel like the attack at the end was a bit rushed and that many people just died but it was still interesting to read about. (hide spoiler)]A big reason why this book has the highest rating is that it finally lived up to its genre, utopia/dystopia. There was more talk and action about the world and I thought it was really exciting. Although it was still definitely a bit rushed and I feel like more action should've happened throughout the whole series, I still enjoyed reading about that aspect in this book. I feel like the end was very rushed. I also began to read the next book of the series, and I feel like there was a huge time jump between the 3rd book and the 4th book that was really important.

I understand that there are books 'in between' the main books of the series but I am not sure I am interested in reading them.  (hide spoiler)]The romance aspect of this book was definitely also better. I think that the way America and Maxon came to be together was stupid, but when they actually were together, I thought that they were well together. Neither of them have much personality so its not that big of a deal, but I was really happy to see how the book ended.I am planning on finishing the series, and although these books had very high ratings, I didn't enjoy them that much. The next books have even lower ratings, so who knows if I will enjoy them at all but I will still read and  them. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jun 19, 2020","Jun 22, 2020","Jun 14, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18635016-the-one

I feel like there was more going on and it was a little less boring than its preceding book. However, the quality of the book did not improve much, and neither did any of the characters. I wish I liked America, I really do. Hating the main character and narrator sucks while you're reading a book. I feel like her character has so much potential, but really her only trait throughout the book was that she couldn't choose between Aspen and Maxon. So many things were happening, yet at the end, it all just kept leading back to the same question - Aspen or Maxon? And that grew to annoy me very much. (view spoiler)[Especially when her 'best friend', Marlee was literally getting beat on stage, the only conclusion she could come to was that she couldn't possibly choose Maxon over Aspen. Yes, she tried to stop it, but when a couple guards came for her, she just immediately gave up and started thinking about her love life instead. Also, when America found out what her country was truly built on, instead of finding a way to fix it and make it be known, she used it as a way to get back at Maxon , while also breaking his trust, for being with other girls - even though essentially what she was in was a BACHELORETTE where the BACHELOR has to choose between different women. If she couldn't choose him, then why did he have to wait around for her?  (hide spoiler)] This book is classified as being a dystopia/utopia, yet the only thing that the main character can think about is romance. However, I do feel like Maxon definitely had more to his character this, but The only reason I am 'Team Maxon' over 'Team Aspen' is because I think he is a more interesting character than Aspen, who is just a super flat character. Some positives to this book was that the world building was a bit better this time. I feel like I understand more of the history behind the world than I did in the previous book and I think that was definitely an interesting part. I think this book ended in a better way than the previous book as well, but it was still kind of a stupid ending. The romance between Maxon and America also began to develop more, so I enjoyed that aspect more in this book as well.The next book has the highest rating out of all the ones in the series, so I am hoping that it focuses less on the selection, and more on the world around them. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jun 16, 2020","Jun 19, 2020","Jun 14, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16248068-the-elite

I’ll catch you.”Whenever I finish a book, I need to learn to sit for a while and think about the book. After finishing a good book, I now realize, I feel so many things, and jumping into writing a  right away will do me no good because I will instantly rate it 5 stars. But, after reading this stunning book, I sat and thought about so many things for a while. This is so dramatic, but I feel like this book has changed me and that I've learned so many lessons from it, that I feel like I will remember for the rest of my life. I learned lessons about love, truth, passion, and power. One of the things I loved about the book was its double narrative. After reading a good story, you usually learn a lesson from it and apply it to your life. Something that the double narrative of the book gave the reader was that reaction after reading a good book. I was able to see how Monique took the lessons she learned from Evelyn's life and applied it to her own, which exemplified the importance of Evelyn's story by showing how it changed Monique's life. It also added some more to the plot and made it more interesting, which is also a bonus. And it also kept you guessing - Why did Evelyn specifically choose Monique to write this story? Where did Monique fall in Evelyn's insane life? (view spoiler)[I was not expecting the end at all. Usually, I feel like I predict some aspect of the end of a book, but this was not something I was excepting and I had not even thought about connecting the dots. (hide spoiler)]I'm not going to sit here and talk about all the lessons I learned from this book because I doubt anyone cares that much, but two of the main things I learned from this book was that just because something doesn't seem entirely perfect, does not mean that it is not good, vice versa. Or in simpler words, not everything is how it seems. To the public, Evelyn may have been seen as someone who couldn't form a connection with someone, I mean with seven husbands? What else could they think? However, it was quite the opposite. Another lesson that I learned was that there are two types of loves - the platonic kind and the romantic kind, and both are equally as amazing and both can make a person just as happy. I learned that maybe some people are only meant to have a romantic, passionate love and some people are only meant to have a platonic, comfortable love, some people both, but at the end of the day, both result in the same things. Happiness. There are so many other lessons in this book, but these definitely stood out to me the most. I think the one things that I may have been slightly disappointed in was the romantic aspect of the book. I feel like Evelyn's relationship with (view spoiler)[ Celia  (hide spoiler)] was a bit underdeveloped and I feel like it was a bit predictable at times, (view spoiler)[ how they would keep leaving each other and then coming back, making their huge arguments seem stupid and meaningless  (hide spoiler)]. However, I still feel like their relationship was so beautiful and the ending made me so happy and sad at the same time. This book also discussed so many important topics about LGBTQ+ people and how especially back in the 1900s, were shunned and how dangerous is was for people to know that you may have been homosexual. And I remember Celia saying something along the lines of, 'how could loving someone be so wrong?' and that just really stuck with me. I could go on and on and talk about all the different aspects of the book, but in conclusion this book was just phenomenal. The writing style of the book was clear cut and easy to read and I hope to read more books like it. I could not put it down and there was not a second that I was bored with it. It is definitely one of my favorites and I highly recommend it....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jul 05, 2020","Jul 07, 2020","May 12, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/32620332-the-seven-husbands-of-evelyn-hugo

i was so shocked when i found out that helion might've been his father, and even though it's probably true, it wasn't really confirmed by anyone...• feyre and rhys' reunion was too die for. i was literally waiting and waiting for feyre to come back to velaris to be reunited with her family and i was so so happy when they were!• after feyre came back to her family in velaris, i was a bit bored with all the talking and planning that was happening. it wasn't really that interesting and it was also a lot to take in at once.• like i mentioned in my general overview, the world building is literally immaculate. i loved learning about all the new courts and just reading about how beautiful they were and the history behind them.• i was really intrigued by all the creatures like the bone carver, the weaver, the bryaxis, and the suriel. especially the bone carver, i just wanted to learn more about their histories and how they came about. i was so sad when the suriel died though :(• the meeting with the high lords was interesting at first, especially with both tamlin and feyre there, but i feel like it was a bit dragged on at a certain point. • this is probably a really unpopular opinion, but i wished that amren had just stayed single throughout the book. she really didn't need a man and i didn't feel any chemistry between her and varian, and their romance just kinda bored me, especially since i knew little of varian.• mor coming out was something that i had not expected but i love her so much and i really hope in future books, she will find a love interest and hopefully be accepted by her family in velaris. she is definitely one of my favorite characters and i just love her in this book so much. • i was literally crying when feyre, elain, and nesta’s father came back and he literally died too soon. he really did try so hard to be forgiven by his family for not being able to do much for them, all those years before.• cassian and nesta were so cute! i was a bit confused with their romance because it was a bit out of the blue, but i am excited to read about in the next book. • i love azriel he is so cute. he literally deserves the world and i truly hope he finds happiness and moved on from mor :(• i forgot to mention - rhys and feyre were so cute. i love them so much and i am so glad they got their happy ending, they deserve it :) (hide spoiler)]...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Jun 29, 2020","Jul 05, 2020","May 12, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/23766634-a-court-of-wings-and-ruin

Many people claim that this is an addictive book that is hard to put down, but I am going to have to disagree on this one. I will admit that I have DNFed this book many times, so going into it for the third time, determined to read it to the end, my expectations were not very high. First of all, I disliked all the characters. They were all really snobby and the way they reacted to things made me cringe. There were many quotes in the book that just made me cringe and I would have marked them to include in this , but I just didn't even want to waste stickies on them. America was made out to be that one girl that was 'different' from the rest, but I think that whole concept was poorly executed because it just made what happened in the book so much more predictable. Maxon was really whiny and didn't have much character. All the other girls in the book also were really flat characters and I did not care for them much. I also hated the way Cass built the world. Most of it just didn't make any sense. I remember when they were taking a history class and they said something about China invading American for money when America was in debt? If you're going to classify a novel as dystopian, then you might as well create an interesting world that makes sense, and not just base it off the fact that there is a king who holds a 'bachelorette' in his 'palace' every couple of years. And the attacks just bothered me so much, they were so unnecessary and they literally just sat around crying for a whole chapter while it was going on. Like c'mon?! Give me some action here... The book should have gone more into depth with the tensions that they may have with other forces, it would have made the book a little more interesting and the world a little better.Then, we had the crappy romance. (view spoiler)[I thought that the very predictable romance between America and Maxon sucked. (hide spoiler)] While I was reading the book, and not enjoying the story very much, I was hoping that the romance might've compensated for it. I am a sucker for romance, even the smallest amount, but this just sucked. And the whole thing with Aspen was just like, why? Although I found the writing style to be extremely boring, I do think that it was easy to read which was basically the only plus. I didn't have to spend too much time analyzing anything and I could just take it all in and read everything at once. I was never really confused with anything that I was reading and I had no trouble following the story, everything was very clear cut. The only reason I will be continuing to read the series is because someone bought me all the books in the series, so I would feel bad if I didn't, but I also do believe that the story has a bit potential and hopefully the next book will be better. I have read series where the first book sucks, but then eventually the story gets a bit better. The concept of this story was a very good idea, but at the end of the day it was just poorly executed and turned into a predictable and boring read. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"May 29, 2020","Jun 13, 2020","Apr 14, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10507293-the-selection

I think the best part of this book was Feyre's relationship with Tamlin and her family. That's it. Her character development was pretty good and I really loved Lucien too. The beginning was slow, but when Feyre got kidnapped it started to get better and I was started to think that the book was really good. The last like 10-15 chapters were soooo dragged out. At that point I was just waiting for the ending, which was just ok. There were many parts about the book I liked, the romance, the writing, the setting... beautiful. There weren't necessarily any parts that I hated or anything, I just could've done without them.

It even has me reconsidering wether this is my favorite movie anymore which is sad since I really loved the movie. However, the book gave me a different perspective into the book that I honestly was not a fan of. I think what makes the movie so good is the soundtrack and the visuals. Without them, the movie would not be half as good. I did not enjoy reading from Elio’s pov and I found it to be boring and a bit sad (in a bad way). The relationship between Elio and Oliver lost its charm and the book, and I came to see how creepy it really is. I did not feel like this was an enjoyable or satisfying romance to read about.

I would hurt you back.”I don't think I have ever had more mixed feelings about a book than this one. I didn't really like it that much and I found it to be a bit underwhelming. There were some parts of the book that I liked a bit but I was pretty indifferent throughout most of the book. What I expected (based off the hype) was an intricate world full with complex fae politics, a badass heroine, a painful slow-burn romance, and an exciting plot. However, I didn't quite get all of these things.Let me start off by saying that I really loved Jude. She was a morally grey character and reading from her point of view was really interesting. She was insanely badass throughout the book and I honestly just loved her for it and she was definitely my favorite part about the book. I didn't really care much for any of the other characters. I hated Taryn, didn't really care about most of the other characters. One of the biggest things that bothered me about the book was the world building. First off, I found the map to be very disproportionate. It didn't really make sense to me and the world seemed so small. I was usually confused when there were setting changes, (view spoiler)[especially towards the end when Jude was walking around the camps and talking to other kings/queens... I was so confused as to what was happening and who everyone was because so many things were just thrown at me about the rest of the Fae world outside of Elfhame. (hide spoiler)] I didn't really feel immersed in the world and the transitions between the human world and the fae world just didn't do it for me.The plot was pretty mediocre. It was extremely slow at the beginning and I almost DNFed it, but things began to speed up a bit so I decided to give it another chance. Some things that happened or were revealed did kinda shock me, but like I said before, most of it was really underwhelming. I wish the book went more into depth about the politics because random information was just kinda put out there sometimes and I was also really confused as to where all the other kingdoms were situated.The romance was mediocre as well. The slow-burn was there, but I just wasn't really convinced with how their 'romantic' interactions came to be if that makes sense. Not much to say there.Overall, this book didn't really live up to the hype for me. I can see why people would love it so much but this wasn't really anything I loved too much and I am not to keen on continuing the series, but I probably will at some point. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jul 24, 2020","Jul 31, 2020","Dec 02, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/26032825-the-cruel-prince

However, in this book, I always knew what was going on and was able to connect pieces of the plot to each other.

This book examined rape culture really well and opened my eyes a little bit wider to things I knew about, but hadn't really thought about in-depth. I really loved Alex and Claire's friendship. It developed really well throughout the whole book. Alex's relationship with Jack felt a bit insta-lovey, and I wasn't really a huge fan of Jack either, and I'm not sure what purpose his character served. Alex was an extremely interesting character to read about and I really enjoyed reading from her perspective. She could really be the epitome of morally grey characters. In a way, Branley was also an interesting character to read about. I like Claire too and she brought up really good points at the end (view spoiler)[about what could have happened instead if she reported what had happened to her. I really wish Alex's friendship with Claire turned into something more tho :(( (hide spoiler)]I love the way this was written! Alex was the main character, but through the different characters, you were able to see how different people perceived her, which I thought was interesting. All of the POVs were different and all the characters were really thought out, so reading through each character's perspective was interesting and different each time. Overall, I definitely think this is an important read, and I enjoyed the book. It brought up really good points.

Your heart.” This book was definitely a rollercoaster, but it didn't really evoke strong emotions in me and it probably won't leave a lasting mark on me. I appreciated the fast-paced plot and all the plot twists, but at the end of the book I wasn't really affected by anything.This book takes place in a very harsh and brutal world. The Masks rule over the Scholars and most Masks are extremely murderous and ruthless people. When I first began to read this, I was shocked at the way the Masks treated the Scholars and I was very intrigued as to why they treated them so horribly. What did the Scholars do to the Masks that made them hate the Scholars so much? We got a short explanation of it towards the end of the book, but I still wanted to learn more. The world-building wasn't too bad, but I've seen better.I'm not sure if I love or hate the way that the dual perspectives worked in this book. Every chapter is switched between Elias' and Laia's point of view. I appreciated the change in plot direction with both and it definitely added to the fast plot, but it made it hard to get invested in both stories. The characters in this book were certainly interesting, but I feel like I didn't really connect to them or know them that well. The Commandment was absolutely horrible and ruthless. She angered me so much, but I am intrigued with her background story and how in the world she came to be the way she is. I feel like I didn't really learn much about Laia or Elias and that their personalities were just based around their 'missions'. I wish I could've seen more of their personalities. I liked Helene and I thought she was interesting. I wish we learned more about her and that she showed up more in the book.The romance in the book was definitely a disappointment. A lot of it felt like instalove and I feel like none of the characters really had any chemistry. (view spoiler)[ I think that Elias and Helene's history made their relationship more complicated and interesting, but I am not entirely sure if I ship them. I prefer Laia with Elias over her with Keenan because I don't really like him.  (hide spoiler)] I wish there was more development and build up in the romance, but there wasn't even really much of it in the book anyways. Overall, I would recommend this book. It wasn't bad at all, but it doesn't necessarily live up to the hype (in my opinion). It is a pretty basic fantasy book , but it definitely is a fun read....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Sep 13, 2020","Sep 23, 2020","Nov 13, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/36040400-an-ember-in-the-ashes

My friend gave me this book years ago and she let me keep it because she didn't like the story. I was intrigued by the book and I knew very little going into it. I read some s for it and there was a mix of people who enjoyed it, and people who didn't, and I think I fall in the middle. Something that stuck out to me in this book was the writing. I mostly enjoyed the way this book was written, but sometimes I think all the metaphors were a bit overdone. However, I definitely think it added more to the story and added to that 'summer' atmosphere, which I really loved. I also forgot to mention those little variations on the 'three people' fables and the way they alluded to the story. Before the big revelation, I read the fable and I was like ""Wait, wow, I see how this connects to all the Liars,"" and that really did make me think. The setting of the book had to be one of my favorite aspects about it. I loved the way that the island and all the houses on the island were described. Summer is my favorite season and I feel like summer in particular just gives off certain vibes that I love, where friends are hanging out, staying up late, and doing things they aren't supposed to (view spoiler)[(Not like setting their grandfather's house on fire though haha), (hide spoiler)] and this book does a really good job of giving off that vibe and creating an incredible and beautiful setting.I think the mystery aspect of the book was a bit lacking, which was a big reason this book didn't receive the full five stars. I went into the book hoping that there would be some kind of big revelation at the end of the book, and a big mystery solved, and that did happen, but just not in the way I would've liked. I feel like leading up the revelation, it was super anti-climatic and a bit predictable. I wish I could've gotten more out of it. In no means was it a bad revelation, I just felt like it could've been better, and I was waiting for better.I like most of the Liars and other characters. I won't list them all, but the characters I don't like are for many obvious reasons and if you read the book, you will understand. I had a hard time keeping up with who all the characters were and how Gat came into the picture, but towards the end of the book I understood who everyone was a bit more. I wish the book went into more depth about the individual characters and made them a bit more unique. I think the family dynamic and relationships really added to the story and I enjoyed reading about all those different relationships. I think it was really interesting to read about how privileged this whole family was and how they tried to make it seem like everyone was perfect, even though they were definitely far from it.The romance in the book was very... forgettable. I feel like it just kind of happened and it was super basic. Like I have said in many previous s, I am a sucker for romance and I usually love it in most books, but in this book, nothing really stuck out to me about it, and that's basically all I have to say. Overall, this was not a bad book, it just wasn't an excellent one, hence the three stars rating. I will admit that sometimes I wish that certain parts were a bit more fast-paced, probably because I wanted to know what happened at the end, but I do think the pacing in the book was pretty good. I do recommend this book because I think it is easy to read and a nice mystery. I need to create a psychological thriller shelf for this to put it in, but I would definitely love to read more books of this genre in the future!...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jun 13, 2020","Jun 16, 2020","Nov 13, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18339662-we-were-liars

It terrified him.”'Six of Crows' is about a gang that is asked to pull off a nearly impossible heist for more money than they could ever imagine having. The gang consists of Kaz, Inej, Nina, Matthias, Jesper, and Wylan. They have to break into the Ice Court, which is nearly impossible to break into, and capture a scientist who created a drug called juda parem. This drug enhances the power of Grisha, a kind of person who has certain abilities and powers. If they ingest it, they become extremely powerful, but fatally addicted to the drug. When I first started the book, I was incredibly confused. Names and places were being thrown at me, and I was just so confused as to what everything was and what it meant. I felt like I was reading a sequel to a book I have never read, and it frustrated me. However, after a couple chapters, I began to understand what everything was and I could easily make distinctions between all the characters.The characters are definitely my favorite part of this book. They are all morally-grey and have interesting back stories. I really enjoyed the dynamic they all had with each other and I really loved the whole gang. Also, there was so much diversity in this book which made me super happy! (view spoiler)[I loved Nina and Matthias, Inej and Kaz, and Wylan and Jesper. The tension between Nina and Matthias was unreal and I really enjoyed reading about their ship wreck story. The angst between Inej and Kaz was also definitely there, and I better be getting an epic kiss scene in the second book! Wylan and Jesper were also so cute and I can't wait to see more of them in the second book (hide spoiler)]The world building and plot were probably the most mediocre parts of the book for me. I didn't enjoy the plot as much as I wanted to, and I felt like the world they were in was big and that I barely knew anything about all the different countries and places on the map. Overall, this book didn't really live up to its hype in terms of plot, but the characters definitely did. I would definitely recommend going into this without high expectations, and I would recommend that you read the Shadow and Bone series before this one. ...more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,"Aug 16, 2020","Sep 13, 2020","Oct 30, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23437156-six-of-crows

There were no parades for us when it was over, no medals or mentions in history books. We did what we had to during the war, and when it was over, we picked up the pieces and started our lives over.”This book was much different than other WW2 books I have read in the past. It focuses on a different aspect of this war that not many people know about - women's role in the war, specifically in France. Going into the book, I was a bit skeptical. The beginning was slow, illustrating a peaceful life in a small town in France. What could have possibly gone wrong? Suddenly things change and war settles among this town and this book highlights how it impacts the Rossignol sisters, and what their role in the war was. Usually when I read World War 2 books, they are all very similar, but this book stood out. It showed how women played a role in the war, and how it impacted their family, beliefs, and lives. The quote I put above is really important to the story because it shows how women were not recognized properly for all the work they put into the war. This book was raw and it told the truth of what life was like during the war. People died, families were torn apart, extremely unfair things happened, but this book showed how the Rossignol sisters continued to persevere regardless of what happened to protect the things that were most important to them, for Vianne that being her children and for Isabelle that being her beliefs and pride. There were so many times in the novel where I just gasped because I could not believe what was happening and how brave Isabelle and Vianne were being. I found myself connecting a lot to both the characters and I thought all the characters were so well written. The only complaint that I would have with this book is at times I thought it was a bit slow, and I found myself thinking at one point that this would only be a 3.5 star reading but it definitely picked back up again in the last couple hundred pages.The ending was so sad, but incredible and it really hit me. I learned so much from this book and I cannot wait for the movie of this book to be created, I imagine that it will be an incredible and touching movie and that it will get the attention it deserves.

This was not as good as Evelyn Hugo, but it was definitely an angsty, fast-paced, and wild read. I liked the uniqueness of all the characters. None of them were perfect and they were all very real. I loved Daisy, Karen, and Camila. Reid never fails to write an amazing, bad-ass woman. Daisy Jones was so iconic and she was definitely my favorite character. I have mixed feelings about the format of this book. I think that the interview format of the book made it a quick and easy read, but I felt a bit disconnected from the story. I also found myself getting confused between who all the different characters were. (view spoiler)[ I can see a trend in Reid's books where there is usually some kind of reporter involved, and the person that they are reporting about has some kind of relation to them, which then gets revealed at the end of the book. I wasn't necessarily shocked when I found out that Julia was the one who was interviewing all the members, but it definitely put things into a different perspective.  (hide spoiler)](view spoiler)[ I was a bit conflicted with who I wanted Billy to end up with in the end. Daisy was his passionate and fiery love, while Camila was his 'safe' love - his water. This reminded me of another aspect in Evelyn Hugo which I talked about in the  for that book where it explores the idea that there are two types of love - the fiery and passionate kind, and the safe and comforting kind (like water). The angst between Billy and Daisy was so uncomfortable (in a good way?) and you could really feel the tension between them. It was intense. The quote I featured really resonated with me, and at the end of the day, I am glad Billy chose his family and that Daisy was still able to live a fulfilled life without a man  (hide spoiler)]The end of the book felt really anti-climatic which was one thing I did not really like, and sometimes I found myself a bit bored just reading about how they were writing songs.

I enjoyed it and sped through the second half of the book very quickly. I thought the romance was super cute, and the Italian setting was so beautiful. I loved reading Hadley's journal and uncovering her mysterious past. This is a cute and quick read, and I definitely recommend it to someone who is looking for a simple book to read....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,Aug 2020,"Aug 07, 2020","May 13, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25756328-love-gelato

I started this book yesterday (well technically two days ago since it's past 12) and I just devoured this book. Let me say - the character development in this book. AMAZING. The character development of Eliza was just the best. The way the book started and the way it ended tied the whole book together perfectly. The way she starts introduces herself at the beginning of the book by saying her name and then introducing herself at the end of the book as someone who created amazing works of art was just so well done, I noticed it right away. Also, Wallace had great character development too! The reason I am giving this 4 stars is that even though I enjoyed this book and finished it all in less than 3 days, it wasn't really anything that blew me away. I didn't really feel connected to the characters, although I definitely enjoyed reading about them. I kind of related to Eliza, but only to a certain point that didn't really allow me to connect with her. I also couldn't really follow along with the Monstrous Sea story. Sometimes parts of it was added to the book, but I honestly had a hard time following it. Maybe that's just me - but it definitely didn't make the book less enjoyable. It just personally, didn't make it more enjoyable for me. Overall, this is a pretty good book and I would definitely recommend it. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Apr 21, 2020","Apr 23, 2020","May 08, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/31931941-eliza-and-her-monsters

It's a complicated mess of wants and needs, boys and girls: soft, rough, and everything in between, an ever-shifting precipice from which to fall. i adored all the characters(mina, trev, rachel, kyle and aunt macy), especially sophie.

Memory is a mean thing, slicing at you from the harshest angles, dipping your  consciousness into the wrong colors again and again. A moment of humiliation, or  devastation, or absolute rage, to be rewound and replayed, spinning a thread that  wraps around the brain, knotting itself into something of a noose. It won't exactly  kill you, but it makes you feel the squeeze of every horrible moment. How do you  stop it? How do you work the mind free?this is my first time adding a quote to a , so excuse me if the formatting isn't very good! before i get into the positives, i want to write a little about the negatives and why i didn't give it a full 5 stars, but 4 stars instead. this book was super super slow. i found myself getting a little bored sometimes and it wasn't as fast-paced as i would've liked. another thing is the color analogies. i feel like those were super repetitive and sometimes i found myself felling a bit confused and having to read a part over and over again to try and understand it.on to the positives. the first thing i wanted to talk about was mental health. personally, i have never struggled with any mental illness but it has always been important for me to try and understand mental illnesses. what i loved about this book is that it didn't romanticize depression and the book just described it as it was. (view spoiler)[there wasn't some big revelation to why leigh's mother killed herself. it was simply because she suffered from depression. (hide spoiler)] the book helped me understand that a little more.after reading this book, i couldn't help but go and research the taiwanese culture. taiwan is such a beautiful country and reading about it was one of my favorite things about the book. i loved to hear about all the different foods and traditions, but i especially liked reading about her family history. i found it to be really interesting. another aspect of the book was revealing secrets about dory's family and why they cut off all communications. (view spoiler)[i kind of predicted that feng was dory's sister, jingling, but it still caught me off guard because i didn't actually think that my prediction would be correct. (hide spoiler)] i was eager to find out the reason why dory decided to cut off communication with her parents and it was pretty eye-opening, but it wasn't really a highlight of the book for me. regardless, the culture aspect of the book was one of my favorite parts and i will definitely be researching about taiwan for the next couple of weeks!throughout the book, leigh struggled with her identity. being half-taiwanese and half-american really made it hard for her to figure herself out, especially when in the states she was considered to be 'exotic' and in taiwan she was considered to be 'foreign' and kinda out of place in both countries. i found myself to be relating to it a bit because i am russian, born in america, so sometimes i struggle between figuring out whether i am ukranian or american, thinking that i have to be one or the other. i really appreciated this aspect of the book because of this and i thought it was executed really well. i hope one day i have the opportunity to go back to ukraine and learn more bout my culture and family so that i feel more connected to it.in the book, leigh struggles with her newfound feelings for her bestfriend, axel. many people disliked the romance part of the book, but personally i really enjoyed it. i thought that leigh thinking about axel and her romantic feelings toward him were written really well and i'm glad how it turned out in the end. i think it really interweaved with the whole theme of the book, (view spoiler)[that life goes on and memories are always going to continue to be made. (hide spoiler)] i think axel and leigh were really cute and i love me some good bestfriends to lovers trope!in all, i think that this book was so beautiful and that there were so many layers to the story. this simply isn't a story about suicide and grief, but its about depression, recovering from loss, family, culture, love, and so much more. i highly recommend this book and i definitely will be re-reading it again in the future! ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"May 02, 2020","May 09, 2020","Apr 23, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/40696982-the-astonishing-color-of-after
