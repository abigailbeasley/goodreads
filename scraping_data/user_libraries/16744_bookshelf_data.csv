But can we please have better delivery? This story was suffocated by a million metaphors, flowery language, long sentences, and relentless repetition. It needed to be cut in half with short, bullet-like sentences cutting through the long ones. It needed three-dimensional characters instead of types. It needed to make use of the language barrier instead of just mentioning it from time to time (see for instance, Butterfly Yellow, a YA novel also with war, human trafficking, and refugee themes) to see how language and culture can be brought to play real roles in character and plot development). Instead, the author has chosen to give readers sugary sentences that they can quote in their social media with a melodramatic effect. The best part of the book is its beautiful cover. The audiobook performance is decent too although I listened to it on 1.5-1.75 speed so as to be done with it asap.

Never fulfilling her potential, but still, very promising. This time, it was a lot of fireworks, but at least for me, it didn't deliver. The first chapters were brilliant. I was expecting a lot. But soon a monotony was established. A familiar cycle of all tell, almost no show. Various narrators, but the same result. By the end of the book, you gather a lot of information about Cyprus’s natural and political history. You are also told a couple of love stories and a few family stories. It left zero impression on me. I could just leave the book unfinished and knew full well all main characters would reconcile by the end of the book and a visit to Cyprus would be planned with some sort of a cliche sentence of unity and solidarity.

I’m just jotting this note down so as to remember that I tried and failed to read this book. So as to never attempt it again in case I forget the horrible experience. Gosh, this was a boring telenovela in the form of a book, a long book that made little sense, was full of melodrama, had caricatures and types for characters, was terribly sexist (no, the fact that it happened in early and mid-twenty century is no excuse), and the mystery was no mystery. I could tell from the very beginning who the “mysterious” burned-face man is. The only surprise was the incest, and that was totally, totally unnecessary. It was just there to make it more melodramatic and dark. Ugh. And don’t get me started on the artificial device of the parallels between Daniel and Julian (sorry if spellings are not right; I listened to the audiobook). The two characters are so mingled, so dependent, and so weakly developed on their own, that everyone, even those friends who had read the book several times mixed them and their life events together. So why two stars and not just one? Because the city atmosphere of the era was really well developed.

I think This was why I didn't warm up to the book until the third story. Up until Dominique's story, the book felt more like a manifesto than a novel. Other than these issues, I loved it all.

There’s also a weakness in characterization that show itself most promineToo many mistakes in how post-revolutionary Iran and Iranians are presented. There’s also a weakness in characterization that show itself most prominently in Hamid. Compare his interrogation scenes with Cromwell’s in Wolf Hall. Both are designed to show the reader that the interrogators are not wholeheartedly invested in their cruel pursuit. They’re aware that they’re doing harm. But where Mantel’s creation succeeds to charm you and win your sympathy and even admiration, Sofer’s leaves you with pity at best and more likely, as was the case with my friends and me, with repulsion. You don’t even need to compare this novel with a Booker winner. Take a look at how successfully Sabaa Tahir has presented the complex character of Elias in her YA series (book1: An Ember in the Ashes) and you’ll see what I’m talking about. And then we come to my pet peeve: this book was far too much ‘tell’ and too little ‘show’. The audiobook was performed by someone who was clearly as alien with Iran as the author. He butchered Khayyam’s quatrain, mispronounced book titles, and even managed to say the names of a few cities with the wrong pronunciation. It was at times more torture listening to him say Persian words than listen to actual mentions of torture in the book as the latter was so glossed over that a foreign reader could well come to believe that an activist in Iran would only be facing a prison sentence or in sever cases death penalty.

I had the same feeling when I read Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. Everyone told me that in Foundation the ideas are great, it's just the characterisation, etc. that are weak. I know that the reason that most of the concepts in the book, in spite of their depth, don't seem that original to me is probably that Asimov's ideas have been picked up and expressed by other authors; that's why I say I should have read this book ages ago, before reading the other, arguably better novels inspired by Foundation. I like Asimov's short stories, I LOVE his non-fiction, but judging from this work, he is not a good novelist. I've been advised to read the second volume in this trilogy to see a big improvement in his storytelling skill. No way. I was bored out of my mind while listening to volume 1. No female character until almost the end of the book, and then only two derogatory minor ones. All characters are types, not 3-dimensional individuals. You can substitute one with the other. Plotlines are so similar that you can easily predict that a) there will be an argument between individuals in the next scene, b) one party will have the upper hand in power and the other in intelligence, c) the one in power seems to hold all the cards at first, d) the underdog always wins because he (yes, always a he) is so cunning and knows how people tick, e) years pass and another crisis looms near, f) go back to (a).

Interestingly, although the author is a woman, for me the best parts belonged to Zhang Bo and Yongzong. These two didn’t need to be constantly explained and even much described; they could talk and act and you’d totally get them. They were warm and alive. Even the college boy that Liya became friends with had similar characteristics. In short, while I was equally fascinated by all characters, I felt that the male ones were more animated and real. That being said, the center of the story for me remains to be the mother and daughter and how the daughter gains more self-knowledge by trying to finally know her enigma of a mother. Also, what great timing. To read this book while I’m reading or have recently finished reading on my own or with my friends: a) Metaphors We Live By in which we discussed thinking of time as forward/behind, a movement through space, etc., b) Recursion, also dealing with the concept of time and how humanity perceives it, c) Games People Play, dealing with performance and faces we show different people among other things, and finally d)The Other Einstein, a book about Einstein’s first wife, a brilliant physicist, and her unacknowledged contribution to the theory of relativity. A final point on the audio version: The audiobook performance is also very good. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jun 22, 2020",Jul 2020,"Jan 14, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/44890075-little-gods

It could have been brilliant as a series of connected short stories. Same content, different rhythm, more opportunities to shift focus, and highlight issues without losing tempo or credibility. Another problem was that Ah Hock talked like a university-educated man. In fact he used a more stylistic type of English than the interviewing lady who is a PhD student, and yet Tash Aw demonstrates that he is quite capable of correctly recording and echoing people’s speech in the dialogues we hear from and among other characters.

The translation is excellent, and the audiobook performance is great too, although too slow for me (I put the speed on 1.5 and then it was ok). I laughed just as hard, but there were elements in the novel that naturally had gone over my head when I first read it stealthily at the age of ten or eleven, and I am very glad that I read it again as an adult. Reading My Uncle Napoleon at this stage of my life has another advantage as well: I have read many more books with which I can compare this one, and I must say Pezeshkzad’s masterpiece reminds me very strongly of Catch-22.In short, apart from the undeniable fact that the likable characters are all male, I find everything about this book admirable....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Oct 26, 2019",Nov 2019,"Oct 26, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/25866.My_Uncle_Napoleon

Firstly, it’s one of the rare books that portray a highly educated woman in a field besides humanity or arts as being strong in character and mind as well as possessing rich empathy. Usually authors, either knowingly or inadvertently, show such women as either shallow and silly or hard and emotionless. Another thing that I love about this book is that the science is real and an organic part of the story rather than some fluff used as a prop. In this aspect, Lost and Wanted reminds me of Neel Mukherji’s The Lives of Others. Finally, I like the fact that Nell Freudenberger has accomplished the difficult task of interweaving several themes and story lines without any of them seeming out of place or inferior. The only reason that I didn’t give five stars to the book was that at times it lost its appeal and felt too long, tough It never stayed that way for more than some pages and the story would pick up again. Finally, a word about the audiobook: sometimes I listen to an audiobook with such a masterful performance that I go in search of the other books performed by the same reader, not wishing to sever the emotional tie I have established with their voice and tone after that book comes to its inevitable end. Ann Marie Lee has become one of these joys. I’m grateful to her for bringing this valuable novel to life for me. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Sep 28, 2019","Oct 06, 2019","Sep 27, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40177418-lost-and-wanted

It was ironic to discover at the end of the book and through the author’s note, that her main intention was to bring Caroline and her unique contributions to numerous philanthropic causes into light because her story struck me as redundant and irrelevant before I discovered that she was one of the real characters in the book. I think part of it was because the writer chose to invent Paul and add Caroline-Paul romance into a book that dealt with atrocities and sufferings that shouldn’t have been pushed aside for interacts of star-crossed lovers dancing in and out of the story. I believe this was done to give Caroline a background before she became more essential to the story, but I don’t feel it has been successful. I increased the speed of the audiobook in all Caroline chapters.What is great about this book however, is focusing on a part of Nazi war crimes that is less dealt with in WWII fiction, and this is done masterfully. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jul 14, 2019","Jul 21, 2019","Jun 04, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25893693-lilac-girls

The best part of it in my opinion was the fact that the form of the book was very much parallel with the subject. There was not a strong story with a clear direction, which aptly reflected the pointlessness of life that the Lost Generation seemed to feel. During our discussion, many said they were reminded of Great Gatsby when reading this book, but what I was much more reminded of was Jack Kerouac’s On the Road. The elements that The Sun Also Rises had in common with Gatsby actually highlighted the differences between Hemingway and Fitzgerald in my opinion.

I don’t know whether this book is a translation or is originally written in English, but the prose was very artificial, especially the dialogues. It was like reading a political essay instead of a novel. The characters were either good or bad, and it didn’t take you beyond a few sentences to figure out which. All the same, the story itself was an engaging one, which is why I finished the book. It deals with vital issues of our present world. I only wish the author refrained from turning certain characters into his mouthpiece and let the events and normal dialogue have their own effect. At times it felt like reading Sophie’s World, with every conversation being carefully devised to teach the reader a lesson. I couldn’t help comparing this novel with Home Fire. They both deal with Islamophobia, jihadis, and the ensuing havoc amid the families who are torn apart by opposing ideologies and ways of life, but how different they are from one another. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"May 06, 2019","May 10, 2019","May 06, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/40910592-north-of-dawn

Ezra being the bad guy was also more or less apparent from the fact that kind, sympathetic Mitsy (not sure of the spelling as I listened to the audiobook) hated him. I knew Mrs Warren wasn’t the killer because she was portrayed as evil, and it was quite obvious that she is the red herring. However, my main problem with the book is not that I wasn’t much surprised by the revelations. Rather, it was the overt sentimentality of the book. Ugh. The narrator lingered in Hal’s mind for too long, describing over and over and over again how she felt, how strong her grief was, how miserable she felt, how frightened and desperate she was, how guilty she felt, etc. Enough already, Ms Ware. Show us, don’t tell us, or at least tell us less. Apparently the writer is described as the modern age Agatha Christie, but if you ask me, she’s anything but. I increased the speed of the audiobook to 1.75. I couldn’t put up with the whiny atmosphere otherwise. I’m not saying the novel is hopeless. Not at all. This book could have been a really good one if it had a ruthless editor who wouldn’t be afraid of trimming it to a third of its present length. When we come out of Hal’s mind and there is some dialogue between other characters, uninterrupted by the commentary on how Hal was perceiving the conversation, things improve a lot. The plot is intriguing as well and perhaps not as transparent for one who doesn’t read a crime novel every week or so :-))...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Mar 27, 2019","Mar 29, 2019","Mar 26, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36373481-the-death-of-mrs-westaway

I started this novel with such high hopes as I had heard so many good things about the author, and YA is one of my favorite genres, too. However, I was soon disappointed. The book tries to be dystopian, but in reality it's an ordinary romance with cliche characters and affected language, peppered with a handful of environmental and political statements to give it a semblance of profundity. I'm definitely not going to listen to the next volumes. With this one, I increased the speed of the audiobook playback to get it over with as quickly as possible.

Maybe enjoyed is the wrong word though. This was, after all, a book of small and large tragedies, in the domestic space as well as in public. At first, I was bored with the chapters narrated by Supratik and wondered why a writer who could so masterfully make you interested in the most trivial deeds and wishes of all the rest of the family would fail at motivating you to invest emotionally in his supposed protagonist.

An essayist because the only nice it’s of his fiction is the historical-political message he wants to convey and a script writer because you can easily transform his novels into movies without a single loss (and probably with some improvements). Those reservations aside, as a spy novel, Hydra Head has another shortcoming as well. It’s not engaging enough, or at least it wasn’t so for me.

The plot, the characterization, and the buildup of suspense were skillfully handled. It is difficult to write a more or less predictable story so well that it becomes unputdownable.

This one is a laudable effort to not only familiarize the reader with anxiety, but also fight the general skepticism about psychiatric treatments.

She's so adept in creating the atmosphere that I could even feel the cold, the immense silence, and the smell of smoke as vividly as if I were right there in the thick of things. The layered mysteries were presented perfectly, with different pieces of the puzzles being with different people.The only thing I'm not buying is that the series is referred to as the Nora Gavin series, whereas I didn't feel her centrality at all. She was a big part of the story, sure, but hers was not the pivotal role that, for instance, Frieda Klein has in Nicci French's books. Maybe this changes in the later volumes although I must say I don't wish for it to happen.

What a long, long, long, long, tedious journey this book turned out to be for me. I am happy for all of you who have enjoyed it and given it four and five stars, but I can’t bring myself to give it more than 2. The main problem I had (it’s so great to finally be able to talk about this book in past tense) with 4 3 2 1 wasn’t its length; I’ve read and enjoyed longer books. No, the major issue was not finding any of the four Fergusons engaging enough. In the last chapter, the Ferguson who was supposedly writing the novel said that the only way he could do justice to the novel was to love each of the three other Fergusons. I’d say the reader must feel a similar love in order to enjoy this book instead of finding it a drudgery. Sadly, I lacked the emotion. The idea behind the plot is brilliant, but a similar idea is, in my opinion, executed far more successfully in Life after Life and not only with regards to creating more lovable characters, but also in marrying history to the narrative plot. History and a study of the society appear as organic parts of the book in Life after Life, whereas in 4 3 2 1 it seems for the most part that a documentary is running in the background, separate from the events of the story. All the same, the book was not devoid of merits for me. There were parts that were beautiful and certainly quotable. However, for me, they were not as frequent as to justify going through 900+ pages. Happily, I didn’t need to. I listened to the audiobook, and the great performance plus the serene voice of the reader encouraged me to keep listening to this seemingly unending novel. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Nov 27, 2017","Dec 10, 2017","Nov 26, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36530496-4-3-2-1

It would certainly help if you have a passion for languages and linguistics. It certainly wouldn’t hurt if you have the same quirky sense of humor as Selin has.

This might be due to the fact that the plot was spoiled in a QA radio program on BBC4, on which Mr. Barry himself read parts of the book, including the birth scene, so passionately that I felt the wonderful performance of the audiobook still had something lacking. Another thing that I wish was included in the audiobook is different readers for the two narrators, one man and one woman. The story was as delicate and majestic as Japanese tea ceremony and the beauty of seeing many of the same characters from a different perspective and as backdrop to another person’s life story never became dull. I look forward to reading the first novel in this series about Eneas. I know I am going backwards! There was yet another book even before that, but it’s in the form of plays.

It is like the grapes on the book cover: all grapes are connected in the bunch. More than anything else I have read, this book also brings home how the horrors (and sporadic joys) experienced in China after the revolution continues to have an effect on the Chinese families who have migrated to the USA. The empowering and also the suffocating force of one’s family is explored from multiple aspects, the different experiences that migrated children and parents have are beautifully delved into, and the hope and despair that they alternately go through are emphatically described.

I liked this much better than her Nightingale novel. Home Front is definitely a page turner, but it is also a tearjerker, which is always a warning sign for me. Also, there were repetitions and explanations that I could do without. I couldn't help comparing this long novel with a chapter in a book that I am reading at the moment: Let the Great World Spin. That chapter is about how the Vietnam war affects an American family, and one of the main lines in Home Front is how Iraq war affects an American family. Whereas Colum McCann's style is crisp, concise, and yet breathtaking in the way it conveys the characters' sense of loss without being in the least melodramatic, Kristin Hannah's continuous return to what has already been emphasized enough decreases the effect she could have had with a terser form.

If it hadn't been the August book of my book club, I wouldn't have bothered going past the first chapter. The audiobook performance was difficult to stomach as well, with three readers trying to speak English with a French accent, resulting not in originality and a native feel, but in distasteful affectation. I couldn't empathize with any of the characters, and their problems seemed extremely superficial, for which I blame the author because I firmly believe that all sorrows are worth our understanding and sympathy; they should only be presented correctly, and Nina George certainly failed in this task in my opinion.

She is -- or rather was at the age of 24 because she is now an old woman and apparently an altogether different person -- rather unlikeable but still very understandable. It is easy to feel compassion for Eileen, to wish her a better life, but it is difficult to enjoy her company, to listen to her detailed descriptions of her various physical obsessions. Yet the author has masterfully created and maintained a Poe-like atmosphere, a fascinatingly believable character in spite of her oddities, and a delicate balance, in my opinion, between the aversion created in the reader and the desire to learn what Eileen will become. For me the most redemptive part of the story was the contrast between Eileen's reaction to Mrs. Polk's confession and Rebecca's attitude in finding that she has missed out on it.

I certainly found it fascinating and touching. I cried at certain parts. However, there were also parts I didn't agree with, or that I felt were exaggerated and simplistic. To those who say the book is one-sided my answer is sure, why not? Memoirs have every right to be one-sided. They aren't academic researches; they are telling things the way the author felt and lived them. I would like to read Satrapi's other books as well. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jun 20, 2016","Jun 25, 2016","Jun 19, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/991197.The_Complete_Persepolis

It's a page-turner, at least for the first three quarters of the book, and the two plots are nicely balanced and developed, but it suffers from repetition and unnecessary fillers. It could have benefited from some ruthless editing. Also, apart from the brief pause on the role Julia had played in the distance created between her and Bertrand, the fault is constantly laid on the husband. I find it hard to believe that a person like Julia wouldn't feel more responsible, more guilty, about her part, where she is so eager, so desperate to apologize for her in-law's behavior sixty years ago to Sarah's son. I should also mention that I particularly liked that the contemporary plot was added so deftly from the beginning, rather than the awkward, artificial way it was done in Nightingale. All in all, one of the better novels about the occupied France and the Holocaust. I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in the genre, anyone who doesn't want to forget the horrific things that mankind is capable of doing. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jul 29, 2016","Jul 31, 2016","Jun 19, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/556602.Sarah_s_Key

I would re-read my favorite passages over and over again. Then for many years I didn't have access to my copy and then it was selected for our book club reading. This time I listened to the English audiobook, experiencing the novel not only in a different language and medium, but also from the altered perspective of a middle-aged adult. I still love the plot. My favorite scenes remain more or less the same. I still find Tolstoy's philosophizing about the role of providence rather uninteresting, though I feel less forgiving about it. Surprisingly, however, one of the main characters has lost all his charm for me: Pierre. I think if I had revised War and Peace 30 years ago, I'd have given it five stars.
