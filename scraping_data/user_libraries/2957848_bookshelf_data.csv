They must wonder: what will I say? How did I feel about this prequel to my beloved book series? I lean into the microphone, my thumb hovering in front of me. With a jerk I plunge my thumb down to the floor with a loud PPPTTTTTTHHHHHHHHWe didn't need this. Let me count the ways.Of all the characters to get a bookIn the original trilogy, Suzanne Collins introduced a menagerie of interesting characters. Characters for whom we had sympathy, characters whose histories we wondered after. President Snow was never one of those characters. Sometimes the bad guy is just the bad guy. To give him a backstory? Why? I mean, the book doesn't do a lot to garner sympathy for the monster he becomes, so I guess there's that, but even still, I entered this book thinking what is the why of this story and it wrapped with that question unanswered. A Haymitch or Mags or Joanna or Coin or Finnick book would have been lightyears more interesting. Hell, the book could have even delved into the 25th games or gone somewhere entirely new. To give us the 10th Hunger Games through the eyes of a villain that is neither entertaining nor likeable? What a waste. We didn't even get a richer view of the world or the war, so the book doesn't even serve as world building lore. It's just... ugh. I hate what this does to the timeline & charactersWhen we met President Snow in The Hunger Games, it's the 74th games and he's been President for quite some time. We don't know his age, though we do know that Caesar Flickerman has been an announcer for a long time, and never seems to look older. Sure, there's ways to keep folks looking young and keep their clocks ticking, but sending us to the 10th hunger games for this prequel? It means that, for the 74th games, President Snow is 82yrs old. Blech. Worse, it makes Tigris a whooping 85, still alive, still running a shop. What?? This book ruined what Tigris could have been. Make it the 16th hunger games, JFC. Also, the mechanisms that have/haven't been built around the games in 10yrs is nonsensical. Also also, Snow being the one to introduce betting on and assistance in the arena? I get the message that the adults are even using the Capitol children, to do their jobs for them, but it honestly felt lazy. Like the introduction of the katniss roots to the story. Like dropping the phrase ""catching fire."" Collins was raising her eyebrows so hard at her readers, I think she might have pulled a muscle. It's boringThis book is from the perspective of Coriolanus Snow. Like the trilogy that came before it, Ballad... is trapped within the confines of the main character's head. The narrative is influenced by his interpretations of the world moving around him. Unlike the original trilogy, this method fails with Snow as a vehicle. We hardly see the games; we're mostly sitting in a chair listening to Snow think about the games philosophically, and judging his fellow students around him. Even though we were trapped in Katniss' head, we still understood who Peeta and Haymitch and Plutarch were. We don't get any richness to the characters flitting around Snow, we just get his put-out brush-offs. I didn't care about the games, I didn't care about the Snow family, I didn't care about the other students, the Peacekeepers, Lucy Gray Baird... I cared a little bit about Sejanus Plinth. A lot of good that did me. It lacks the character building of its predecessorsKatniss Everdeen was a firey character who was curious and angry about the world. Coriolanus Snow doesn't really care what's going on around him, as long as he lands on top. It could have been interesting if Collins had leaned into her character's sociopathy, but she didn't. She seemed torn between humanizing him and allowing him to be a pure, black-hat villain. That indecision sent us spiraling even deeper into a poorly constructed main character, a poorly constructed story, and flat secondary/tertiary cast members.The songs. My god, the songsThere were so many, and the audiobook version has the narrator speaking them plainly. FUCKING SING, BRO! This was pretty awful. That last one is a petty complaint, but it leads me to my final thought on the book and hey this is the only spoiler don't look if you don't want to be spoiled I said don't look okay you've been warned: I despise that Lucy wrote The Hanging Tree.

They promise tell-alls, they insist they have unique and interesting stories to tell. Then, check deposited, they sit down and write a bunch of fluffy nonsense that wastes my time and makes me angry (see Conan O'Brien's assistant's unreadable garbage and Amy Poehler writing a whole chapter about how she doesn't want to write the book so she's going to have friends write essays about nothing within her book).Britney Spears didn't do that.Britney Spears said ""you paid me money because you wanted to hear the full story. Well here it is. All of it.""It's brave, it's unflinching, it's heartbreaking. Yet it's simultaneously somehow patient and hopeful and kind. Britney Spears' parents turned her into a cash cow in the most awful sense of the idiom, then used and abused her and ultimately took over her life and institutionalized her so that they could take her money. As Spears recalls her father saying: ""I'm Britney Spears now.""And how awful were we? That is, society and the public? Judging her, following her escapades on the front of tabloids and Perez Hilton. I was only 18yrs old in 2007, but it still sucks that I was caught up in the nonsense; how Britney Spears was recast as a villain simply because she couldn't be perfect, something not one of us is capable of being.Honestly this book really only got 4 stars instead of 5 because of the god stuff at the end.

Wavewalker is what it appears to be: absolutely fascinating.At 7yrs old, Suzanne Heywood's parents made an announcement: the 3 of them and Suzanne's 6yr old brother would hop into a giant sailboat and follow Captain James Cook's 3rd voyage, which would take ~3.5yrs. 10yrs after they set sail from England, Suzanne escaped her abusive and neglectful family to find a life on solid ground. I really don't want to say much more. Heywood's life was lonely and cruel. She survived a life threatening injury and abandonment. She survived a childhood and adolescence of solitude and sadness. And all of this was navigating aboard a sailboat, full of her narcissistic, alcoholic parents, her ambivalent brother, and a constantly rotating menagerie of amateur adventurers, sailors, and youths looking for cheap transportation.

How did I find this book? Did I enjoy it? Was it scary? Is the hype justified?I... I don't know.Here's what I rarely find myself at a loss for words. How did I find this book? Did I enjoy it? Was it scary? Is the hype justified?I... I don't know.Here's what I do know.House of Leaves is a wild concept. A found fiction work of massive proportions, which came out on the heels of ""The Blair Witch Project"" and years before the likes of ""Paranormal Activity."" The premise, roughly, goes as follows:Johnny is a grubby guy in his early 20s working at a tattoo parlor and bumbling around in the 90s world of LA clubs and drugs. He walks into the apartment of a dead guy, and is drawn to a chest full of papers. Turns out the dead guy (who was found dead in a puddle of blood with claw marks on the wood floor) had been laboring to create a comprehensive & academic analysis of a movie. This movie may or may not actually exist in Johnny's world. It has a cult following, but some folks disclaim its existence. ""The Navidson Record"" is a documentary (is it?) created by Will Navidson chronicling his family (him, a wife, a son, a daughter, a dog, a cat) as they embark on next chapter of their lives into a home in Virginia. Thing is, the house is bigger on the inside. And that extra space might be malevolent. House of Leaves is wildly fractured. It's partly the dead guy's academic musings, partly a collection of prior academic texts on the film and its subjects, partly a retelling of what one actually views when watching the film, partly Johnny's scribblings as he works through all this writing, and partly inserts by the person who receives the final product from Johnny. Confused yet?I like fractured narratives, but this was something else. Author Mark Danielewski has given us hundreds of footnotes. Some of them refer to fake articles that were purportedly written about this fake movie. Others are very real philosophical texts / news articles / etc. Some of the interviews and academic texts that refer to the movie in this book treat it like a documentary. Others treat it like a work of fiction. Johnny is unsure whether this movie ever existed at all. Also, Johnny is slowly losing his mind. The retelling of the film is fascinating. Will, his family, and his friends' attempt to explore the yawning hallway that has appeared in his house is fun and fraught. Johnny, on the other hand, is awful. He's a sexist piece of shit, and, quite frankly, I feel like Danielewski is also quite sexist. The way the few women in this 550+ book are portrayed is repugnant. This book has hardly any women, and those that appear are characterized as sex objects, nags, or insane. Not a good look, and a big factor in my 3-star rating. It's very, very telling that the glowing s of House of Leaves come from men, and the skeptical, eye-rolling s come from women. I especially love Emily Barton, coming to us from The Village Voice in 2000: ""Danielewski’s bloated and bollixed first novel certainly attempts to pass itself off as an ambitious work; the question for each reader is if the payoff makes the effort of slogging through its endless posturing worthwhile.""Ha!In an attempt to create real academic discourse in House of Leaves, Danielewski goes down wild philosophical rabbit holes. I enjoyed his discussion of The Minotaur, of the nature of echoes, of labyrinths. I also liked that, in pulling fake quotes from real people such as Stanley Kubrick and Stephen King, he believably captured their unique voices. That said, parts of this book are very bloated and feel embarrassingly earnest. Danielewski wants so badly for us to think he's clever, and it's laid bare in some very awkward passages (the biblical sections, woof). The book delves into the spatial tools usually used by poets. When characters are walking down The Hallway, the text becomes squished into the middle. When the ceiling presses down, the text only appears on the bottom of the page. Some of it was clever, but a lot of it was exhausting (why do I have to flip the book upside down and all around and read backwards? This is just stupid). There was a part of the book where Johnny is like ""some of these pages were set on fire. I kept in what was left and didn't try to fill in the holes on the page made by the fire."" And then, like, a single letter is missing. That's not how fire on paper works?! I know that's petty but it was exhausting to read this section with all the ""[ ]"" indicating burned away letters and words. For it to not even make sense made me throw up my hands. I'm going back to Emily Barton for the TL;DR: ""It is frustrating that House of Leaves is such a mess, because when Navidson’s story glints through the murky waters of Danielewski’s prose, it grabs hold and won’t let go... The horrors that ensue keep the pages turning even when one’s patience for the writing wears thin.""I couldn't agree more. I really enjoyed the parts of the book that were focused on Navidson’s story. I also enjoyed the dead dude's philosophies. That said, Johnny detracted from enjoyment of the book, and much of the physical elements of the book fell flat. Would I recommend this book to you? I mean, maybe. If you like open-ended, unanswered academic horror, sure, try it on. But this book always has been and always will be quite polarizing. ...more",Notes are private!,1,4,1,"Feb 23, 2024","Mar 03, 2024","Feb 23, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/871186.House_of_Leaves

Nevertheless, the messages in these pages were so poignant I couldn't ding him anymore. Go and read Radicalized.Oh, you need more convincing? Well, fine, then.Here's what you'll get when you listen to me:Story #1 follows a woman who has fled to the United States as a refugee. After getting kicked around for a while she finally finds herself in a subsidized apartment where the landlord has made deals with companies. That is, they've installed specific toasters and fridges and ovens in exchange for a cut of the profits. What profits? Well, these appliances only work with ""authorized"" products. The toaster has its own line of bread, etc. When the toaster company goes out of business and can no longer tell the difference between authorized and unauthorized bread, our protagonist tries to break free of the change of late stage capitalism.Story #2 opens on a superhero who sees white cops beating the hell out of an innocent black man. The superhero decides to intervene. What this means for how he's viewed and treated by society, and what it means for the black man involved, is something he could never anticipate. Story #3 is a critical look at our healthcare system. Why are certain treatments for deadly illnesses not covered? And what happens if we move to even the score, eye-for-an-eye style?Story #4 is the crumbling of society, told from the point of view of an incredibly wealthy financial advisor who has been doomsday prepping for just such an occasion. Each story is brutal in its own way. Comments on climate crisis, on moral obligation, on the importance of free choice, on the commodification of people, on our distance from the natural world. And this was written in 2019, before all the madness of 2020 and beyond. It rocked me. And, if it weren't for clunky dialogue, this would get 5 stars simply because of how timely and earnest it is. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Feb 19, 2024","Feb 23, 2024","Feb 19, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/41447687-radicalized

This should have been a NYTimes Opinion piece or something; it shouldn't have been marketed to us as narrative fiction.

I'm not sure anyone picking up this book needs an education on the history of psychedelics or pyramid schemes or how the rich hide their money. Also, the idea that a rich, white man in California would be thrown in prison for having some cocaine on him is ridiculous. C'mon, Doctorow, that would never happen.

Awkward, independent Holly who worked through the timidity impressed upon her by her mother to become one hell of a private investigator.This book did her a disservice.The biggest issue with this book is there's no intrigue or mystery. King immediately tells us what's going on, who did it, and what became of what they did. The reader is forced to watch Holly trudge along and figure out what we've known the whole time. There's dramatic irony, and then there's boring storytelling. This falls into the latter. King needed to hold something back - either let the WHO dangle till the end, or save the WHAT BECAME OF IT for the climax of the plot. Without that, this book should have just been a short story. It's also a rather repetitive book. King goes on and on about COVID: getting it, wearing masks, elbow bumps. Like, I appreciate his encouraging the elderly readers to get vaccinated, but the 85th time he awkwardly dragged masking up into the narrative I groaned out loud.Lastly, the racism in this book served 0 purpose.

We'll measure the journey in inches because Roland has a story to tell, and it's going to take a while.Wizard and Glass takes a break from Old Roland and his rag-tag group of New Yorkers, and flings us into Roland's youth. He's 14 and has been sent out with his two best friends to look into something going on in the outer reaches of his world. There's corrupt cowboys and a perverted witch and a sexy orphan and The Thinny. The best part of this book is Sheemie. Prove me wrong. King falls into the same old pitfalls: his characterizations of women/POC leaves much to be desired. That said, this was another fun installment of his epic. Pivoting to Roland's past through a story of boys going to a town where things aren't quite right was clever. It had echoes of Harvest Home and many a spaghetti western. We also finally met Susan so, that's one mystery solved. I appreciated the ""previously on..."" at the start of the book.

Too many characters too fast. In Parker-Chan's first book, She Who Became the Sun, the reader spends much of their time following Zhu Chongba. We watch their growing up and struggling to survive. We're invested in the character. Chongba's counterpart, Ouyang, isn't fleshed out until later. Parker-Chan makes the correct move here: introduce the world, get us deep in one character, then flesh out another. There were a few tertiary characters as well, most notably Wang Baoxiang, the sad son. Well, in He Who Drowned the World we're jumping from character to character with whiplash speed. We have no time to get resettled in Parker-Chan's world, or to become reacquainted with characters. Nope. Straight into the fire. It's near impossible to care about the various players in this book when we're just quickly scratching the surface of one, then jetting off across the lands to another. Parker-Chan may have been living in this world for the past year, but the rest of us haven't been. You need to sllloowww dooowwwnnn. 2. This is a battle book, which gets a big yawn from me. She Who Became the Sun had so much character building and interesting, dynamic scenes between characters. Everything I read in He Who Drowned the World was just ""let's talk about strategy. FIGHT! Here's a plan to infiltrate- FIGHT."" Blech, ugh, blarg. Not my taste, and a huge departure from the first installment. Yes, we all knew the second book would involve war, but there's a way to do it without a plodding ""we walked, we talked, we fought"" plot. This might not be fair; war books aren't my jam. But it's my  so here we are. 3. The 3 main characters feel so much flatter to me in this second book. Ouyang and Wang Baoxiang are just trembling little balls of rage. Every other paragraph reminds us how they're shaking with fury or biting back screams of anger or whatever. We get it. Can we have, oh, I don't know, DEPTH?! Speaking of, the artist formerly known as Zhu Chongba (their name is changed at the end of the first book) is on some Dune fate shit. Walking toward their terrible purpose, knowing nothing will get in their way. Flattened. Disappointing. I simply could not with these characters. So I discarded it. Life too short and all that. PS. The next book in my pile is the 4th installment of Stephen King's Dark Tower series. He spent several pages up front both recapping his epic, as well as giving us the last few pages of the prior book. Other serialists take note: that is how you do it.

This memoir tells the story of Chris Broad, who, fresh out of college, joined the JET program to teach English in Japan in 2012. Despite having little knowledge of the country or its language, Broad is accepted into the program. He's lived in Japan ever since.I loved 2/3 of this book. Broad's first 3 years in Japan were vivid and entertaining. Broad retells his attempts to navigate conventions, culture, food, and public transportation. This is why I came to this book. I wanted to hear what it's like to navigate a country so different from the one in which I live. I wanted to hear about the cities I plan to visit: Osaka, Tokyo, Kyoto. I wanted detailed recountings of random bars and restaurants he'd slipped into, how he found the weather, everything. And the first two thirds of the book really did deliver that. After year 3 in the JET program, Broad decided to move on from teaching and become a full-time YouTuber. Great! That means we'll see even more of the country through his eyes! Wrong! Now we get lengthy chapters about cats and about some random pop star I've never heard of and about the time Broad went viral after an air raid alarm went off at 6am. And, look, maybe it's unfair to swipe a star off of my  because the book went full memoir at a certain point. But the book became so myopically focused on Broad's career... it got real dull. At one point he mentions this incredible cycling journey he completed, but all we hear about it are the negative comments on the YouTube videos. Seriously? He tried to pull it back talking about earthquakes, but then he complained about Kyoto having tourists and I was sort of put off by the dude by the close of the book.TL;DR - entertaining and well-written for two thirds of the book; falls off once he starts talking about cats. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Nov 29, 2023","Nov 12, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/64645770-abroad-in-japan

Sounds good to me. This book had been recommended to me byBadass, dragon-riding warriors where the main character is female + some hot&heavy romance? Sounds good to me. This book had been recommended to me by several people before it was finally my turn to pick it up from the library. I put the book I was already reading on pause to dig in... and came out feel very meh about the whole thing.Fourth Wing focuses on its main character, Violet Sorrengail, 20yrs old. She was training to be a scribe for the military until her sensitive father died and her warlord mother commanded her to put down the books and pick up some daggers.Why would a mother do this? Especially when her older daughter is already embroiled in the (nebulous, murky) war she's leading? Her eldest, a son, is 5yrs dead fighting in the same war. What's more, Violet is made of tissue paper. She has a joint disease that makes her super susceptible to injury. Dragon School (that's what I'm calling it) kills a hefty percentage of soldier-hopefuls. What sort of mother would shove their delicate daughter into this? Especially when that daughter doesn't want to go and is also already studying to be a scribe. Unclear. Author Rebecca Yarros didn't flesh that out. I wonder if it's because Yarros hails from a military family herself (father is career; husband is career), so going into the military maybe seems... natural to her? I don't know, but her refusal to flesh out Violet's mother leaves a gaping hole for me. Even Violet's sister and best friend try to convince Violet to ignore her mother and ditch Dragon School. Violet demurs, with vague statements like ""she'll just haul me back here."" What?? Run away! To attend Dragon School, the very first thing you have to do is walk across this slippery, narrow parapet. Violet anticipates ~16% of those who attempt it will FALL AND DIE. AND NO ONE WILL STOP THEM. Don't they have a war to win?! Why in the ever loving fuck are they killing off dragon riding soldier potentials?!The senseless violence only gets more unhinged. Students murder each other just for funsies. Then, on Dragon Prom, when the dragons come check out the humans and pick their dates, the upper years can't interfere even if students go out and murder fellow students and/or murder dragons. Again: there's a war afoot. What is even going on?!?! These rules are nonsensical. I mentioned Violet's best friend. Let's talk about him again. Violet wants to bone him, and he likely feels the same. He breaks the rules right at the beginning of the book in an effort to get her to run away from Dragon School. When she resists, he resigns himself to try and protect her. Then, Yarros decides that it's better for her protagonist to be attracted to the tortured, dark, angry character, rather than the level-headed one, so she writes in something about how the level-headed one would never, ever break the rules, even if it meant Violet died. So, she scrubs away his personality and all we have left is someone so obsessed with The Law that he'd straight up watch the woman he loves dies. This is contradictory and insanity. I have more.I don't know how she manages it, but Yarros manages regularly pen both fragmented and run-on sentences. She lops off the first word or two of a sentence, assuming we'll get it from context clues. In the very next sentence? She'll go on for a paragraph. I ask you: WHERE THE EDITORS AT?!Yarros probably wrote Violet as ""lifting her chin"" approximately 5000 times. People can do other things with their bodies. Again: Editors? Anyone?There's so much explanation of the way the different platoons are split up and the military hierarchy of this world. That would be fine, if Yarros took equal care to flesh out her characters. She didn't. So we have these two dimensional characters surrounded by intricately defined badges and chains-of-command. EDITORS?! BUELLER?!Lastly, and this feels petty, but there's too much cursing in this book. It's not that I'm so stuffy and uptight that I can't handle some *ahem* adult language. No, there's so much cursing in this book that it just felt lazy. Why bother with inventive language and description when you can just pepper in some ""shits"" and ""fucks."" Oh, you edgy. The hype around this is so confusing. What, exactly, did people like? Does everyone just love dragons so much they don't care about the story around them? Yarros does some good things with her narrative: we have offhanded LGBTQ+ representation (offhanded as in they're mentioned casually, which I appreciate), and we have a female protagonist who rides dragons. But... so what? Inclusion and a female main character doesn't inherently make a book good. That same female protagonist is constantly guarded and saved by those (men) around her. Even as Violet is going on about how she can take care of herself, and even as her broody love interest tells her how strong she is, her arms are falling out of their sockets and men and dragons are picking her up and whisking her away from danger. She does not read as strong to me. She reads like a weak, whiny liability. Her transformation into an agile fighter adept with daggers comes out of nowhere and makes no sense. Then again, nothing really makes sense in this book so... **shrugs**. PS sex scenes that read: ""he slammed me against furniture and shoved himself inside of me with super duper force so angry"" aren't sexy. Yuck.

It brought tears to my eyes.The Price of Salt takes place in the late 40s/early 1950s. Our protagonist, Therese, is a 21yr old woman working at a department store in NYC right before Christmas. She wants to be a set designer for plays, but hasn't yet been able to break into that world. She has a boyfriend toward whom she feels indifferent. He doesn't excite her. He's a mediocre artist who will eventually fall into his father's business. Therese doesn't know what she wants, but it's not this.Then Carol walks into the store.What happens next is masterful juxtaposition. Carol is in her early 30s, has a young daughter, is going through a divorce. She and Therese meet at her lowest point. She is terrified of what comes next. She tries to scare Therese off, but Therese is absolutely smitten. Almost begrudgingly, Carol enters into a love affair in which she has all the control, while the rest of her life spins out. And how beautiful is that? Patricia Highsmith takes two women: a young optimist who had been searching for someone or something to spark excitement and love meets a tired, angry, scared older woman on the cusp of the unknown as a divorced woman at a time when women do not get divorced and rarely work... never mind entangle themselves romantically with another woman.Therese is frustrating in her naivety and obsession. Carol is frustrating in her guarded nature and coldness. The pair are exceedingly selfish, attempting to fight through the fog toward what their futures may look like, and trying to discern if those futures involve the other. The book is framed around a jarring dichotomy: desperate overtures and the mundane. It's masterful. It's wrenching. It's literature at its finest.(Why 4 stars, then? Because, in the end, I honestly hate them both, and I don't think that was the book's intent.

They become obsessed with one another.The Commandant and The Garden are at war, I guess. Why and for what? We don't know. What exactly are The Commandant and The Garden? No idea.

Whether Shannon Chakraborty always intended for Amina's adventures to span multiple novels, or whether the publishers waggled a check in front of her face, it makes no difference. The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi stands alone. The primary objectives of the book are resolved, and we're left with a nice little bow at the end, with the door cracked open for continuations. Is that a spoiler? If it is, well, you're welcome. I feel like you should know before going into this book that you can read it and then move on, if you so choose. You won't have to kick rocks waiting for #2 to come out. You can enjoy Amina on the sea, and then continue living your life.How wonderful, because The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi is a success. It's a playful pirate tale about Amina al-Sirafi, a retired pirate captain. She's in her 40s, living a quiet, remote life with her mother and daughter... until she's called back to the waters. It's a unique lens. Amina is older, she has ailments and she isn't as quick as she used to be. She's torn between the love and duty she feels toward her daughter, and the call of the ocean. She's also utterly normal. While people whisper tales about the fearsome pirate Amina, Amina describes herself more as a reformed thief and scavenger. She scoffs at the fictions weaved about her, though doesn't correct them. Better to have folks think twice before challenging her. Amina's crew includes longtime friends, each of whom have unique voices, worries, and desires. Dalia is an elderly potions wizard; Majed a genius navigator; and Tinbu a loyal and loving first mate. Their setting contains some real world details, as well as a heaping helping of magic. Their language is frothy, light, and contemporary. Honestly, I could see the language getting dull over multiple books. As a single novel? It was delightful. Fantasy can be anything. Why not a middle aged lady pirate who struggles with the warring calls to ambition and to familial responsibility? I'm relieved to see more representation in fiction, and to see authors having so much fun with the task....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jan 20, 2024","Feb 04, 2024","Sep 08, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61294937-the-adventures-of-amina-al-sirafi

The anecdotes/""case studies"" didn't add anything for me, personally. I skipped those. That said, I could see them being helpful for others to feel less alone. The big problem I had with this book was when Nedra Glover Tawwab tackled the concept of a person who grew up in a dysfunctional household not wanting to have children. She says things like (and I am paraphrasing) ""instead of thinking about what you went through, think about the world you could build for a child."" She doesn't say ""but it's totally cool and understandable if you don't want to have kids. For those of us who had to parent our parents and/or our siblings, it is enough to want to spend your adulthood parenting yourself."" This was a damaging oversight, in my opinion. I wish she had had the lens to recognize that some of us have to defend not wanting to have children. If our upbringing influenced that, we don't have to push past that.

Journalist Michael Finkel read about it from his Montana home and decided he needed to meet Knight and write a piece on him. The book weaves Knight's story with the philosophy and study of loneliness vs. aloneness, stoicism, humanity's social urges, the healing powers of nature, and mental illness. The book is slight, owing in large part, I think, to the lack of information Finkel actually has on Knight. Knight's family declined to speak to Finkel (despite his aggressive attempts to persuade them), and Knight himself seemed torn between telling his story and turning Finkel away. He landed in an odd middle ground, sharing pieces of himself, but only enough for us to get a bare sketch of who he is and what brought him into the woods.And that's the big issue here, and why I waffled on a 3 star vs a 4 star rating. We don't actually know why Knight first went into the woods, why he stayed, and why he arguably terrorized the community he repeatedly burglarized for 27 years. Finkel doesn't explicitly say it, but hints that Knight may have been so disenfranchised with the world, and was on the brink of killing himself when he plunged into the forest. But that's an educated guess on Finkel's part; Knight never says why he did it. He simply says he got in his car, drove down to Florida, then back up to Maine, then parked his (brand new, co-signed by his brother) car, left the keys, and pushed into the woods. He found a decent spot to hunker down, and so he did. Note that he did this with no plan and with basically no gear. So next up on the list was to go and steal everything he needed from those around him. Who was around him? Mostly seasonal cabins. Oh, and a camp for adults with special needs which is run exclusively on donations. Knight stole from the camp and from the cabins consistently for 27 years. He also stole cash, though he never ventured to a store. He just broke into places and took their food and clothes and propane tanks and books alcohol and bedding over and over again. Victims told stories of children being terrified, of adults staying up all night with their gun in their lap, people being scared of going outside at night. And this is where the narrative really suffers. Finkel clearly likes Knight. Finkel is also a man. Can you imagine being a woman and knowing there's someone out in the woods who has been breaking into homes for decades. He never hurt anyone and he comes across as harmless, if a little odd, but how in the actual fuck could anyone have known that? People were leaving stuff out for him with notes begging Knight not to break into their homes. He did it anyway. He terrorized a community for almost 30 years for no reason.So, spoiler alert: I think Knight is a bad person. If you want to escape into the woods for all time, fine. But to make that decision with no gear and no planning and just steal from people? And then posture like you've cracked the code of life by doing this? You're a parasite, dude. Get a grip. Is he severely mentally ill? Finkel suggests not. He states that the legal system tried to label him with various diagnoses: Aspergers, Autism, Schizoid Disorder, but that none of them fit. Finkel is skeptical that Knight suffers from any mental illness at all, and that he might just prefer the company of the self and of nature. If that's the case, then let me diagnose him as a selfish prick. His family thought he was DEAD. His mother AGONIZED over him disappearing for the better part of THIRTY YEARS. And Finkel's story demonstrates zero remorse on Knight's part, other than he's a bit ashamed of all the stealing now that he's been caught. Bish please.Then we've got Finkel himself. Dude lives in Montana with a wife and kids, but keeps going to Maine to talk to this guy who doesn't want to talk to him. He's basically stalking a family that has begged him to leave them alone. His persistence could be chocked up to his profession, but I think that Finkel's just a dick. That might be why his book is so sympathetic toward Knight: he sees himself in the guy. I feel sorry for Finkel's wife. Also at one point he goes on a tangent about prison isolation and Knight's isolation in the woods. Apples to oranges, bro. Prison isolation usually means no light and no stimulation at all. You should have read another book before you grasped at that straw. That pissed me off. So why, then, did this book get 4 stars? Because despite how trash Knight and Finkel are, this book is absolutely fascinating. That a person could tuck into the woods for 27 years before he was found. That he was able to survive solely on things he stole and his scrappiness (because he went into the woods when he was 20. Most 20yr olds would die immediately during their first Maine winter exposure). I also appreciated the long list of further reading in the back of the book, and the descriptions of the Maine woods, a place I have been exploring since I could toddle around on two legs. The moral of this : read it, but brace yourself. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Aug 21, 2023","Aug 25, 2023","Aug 21, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30689330-the-stranger-in-the-woods

I enjoyed the many literary and mythology references peppered throughout, and appreciated the modern take on women (eg. having the male protagonist, Tom, tell Cassandra her body is hers alone to do with what she will. Hell to the yes. Also the body positivity. Yes! Women have curves!).The best part of this book, though, isn't even our characters-in-love. It's Bazzle, the lil street urchin Tom takes in for reasons not made clear until the end. He's so cute and his introduction adds depth and common ground for both Cassandra and Tom.

I've seen some criticism that she ""perpetuated"" female athlete abuse witKara Goucher is an incredibly brave woman and an incredibly talented athlete. I've seen some criticism that she ""perpetuated"" female athlete abuse with her early silence. I have to say that I find this criticism bullshit. Imagine you're young, you've landed a dream job, you're eager to please your boss and reach your goals. Are you really going to question your superiors or speak up for others or stand up for yourself? So few people are capable of that. Ever. It only took Goucher until her 30s, and what silence she broke was way scarier for her than it would be for someone to speak up, say, in an office environment. To roll your eyes and say a 23yr old woman should have known better is asinine. The people who lob this criticism have likely never spoken up in their pathetic, navel-gaze-y lives.Ahem.If you couldn't tell from that defense, The Longest Race is not just a book about Kara Goucher's relationship with running. It's about Nike, their Oregon Project, and the monster Alberto Salazar who was protected by Nike even after he was found guilty of doping violations and of sexually assaulting women under his tutelage. In short: it's a lot.Goucher and her ghost writer Mary Pilon take all of this head on. They speak frankly about Salazar's abusive behavior. They're honest about the toxic body expectations that are placed on female athletes. They point out how women's bodies are constantly sexualized and commented on, from sports attire ads to Runners World articles to sideline banter. Being a runner and a woman can be complicated labels to wear. Many women come to running as a way to make their bodies smaller, rather than as a way to love themselves. Goucher explores all of these relationships, and how her orientation to the sport changed and evolved through each chapter of her life. I'm not sure I've ever read a better memoir/piece of running nonfiction. Like Goucher, I love running still, but you better believe I'm relieved I never owned much Nike gear. I'll never buy it again.One final note: having Mary Pilon's name on the cover and having her write the first pages of the book was a classy act. That honestly tells you everything you need to know about Goucher. I believe her.

This begs the question:What the fuck does Ray Nayler know that we don't?The Mountain in the Sea is so many stories wrapped into one. It's a battle cry for conservation. It's an acknowledgment that humans aren't the only intelligent, or even the most intelligent being on the planet. It's a question about what makes a soul, what makes consciousness. It's a morality debate when it comes to AI. It's a warning about how we destroy the planet to harvest as many resources as we can as quickly as we can.In short: it attempts way too much, and fails on nearly ever front. For starters, there are way too many points of view in this book. We've got Ha, the scientist who is obsessed with the intelligence of octopuses living on an island trying to make contact. We've got Rustem, a hacker who gives us a lens into tech and AI companionship in this near-future. There's Eiko, a gentleman who was forced into slavery on an AI-controlled fishing boat. And then we get a few other vignettes into the peripheries of this world. Because Nayler is spanning the globe with his scope, we never really get to know any of the characters in the book. We're staring at them from 30,000 feet, trying to piece out their motivations, fears... the humanizing qualities of them. Which is ironic, because one of the main themes of this book is that humanity does not just exist within homo sapiens. Why, then, are we denied getting close to a single character?I feel like Nayler had a really fantastic idea here. He was mulling over some big, philosophical questions about who makes humans, whether homo sapiens embody those qualities, and the responsibility we have to protect the world we've raped and pillaged since we began walking upright. But these are GIANT ideas, and can't really be tackled in a single, fictional book. Plus, Nayler isn't a writer and it shows. The first 30 pages are gruellingly bad. Poor metaphor, clunky scene setting. Just a horror. Once he pivots toward dialogue and plot it's not bad anymore, persay, but the writing isn't what I would consider ""good.""Also, not enough octopuses.TL;DR - excellent ideas poorly executed by someone who isn't a writer and who also probably knows something we don't namely that octopuses are going to take over the world....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Aug 15, 2023","Aug 21, 2023","Jul 06, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59808603-the-mountain-in-the-sea

Not the sexual assault, not the crueltyDark, deep, and honest, Elliot Page bravely wrote his memoir Pageboy with the conviction to leave nothing out. Not the sexual assault, not the cruelty of his father, not the fear and abuse that came with being different. The narrative is not quite linear. We start in his youth, go through becoming famous, struggling with sexuality and identity, and last to acceptance of the self. But at times we dive backward or speed forward, the better to illustrate a scene or to provide context to Page's life. I read somewhere that Elliot Page wrote this book himself, and was also the one to incorporate the notes/changes suggested by editors and agents. In a world where celebrities are churning out memoirs at an alarming pace, and with most of them being ghostwritten, it was refreshing to hear Page wanted the book to be his. It helps, too, that Page actually has an important story to tell. That said, the book is a little clunky. Page seems to loathe contractions. Page sometimes seems hellbent on being poetic, and some earnest attempts to weave a beautiful sentence ring hollow, either because a word was used incorrectly or because the obvious effort takes the reader out of the narrative. Page mentions Maggie Nelson's Bluets collection multiple times, so I have to wonder if he just desperately wanted his book to have similar elegance, leaning more toward poetry than prose. Other times, Page is (deliberately?) crass. The way he describes sex is so clinical, stark, and littered with slang. That was jarring. Writing about a cabin gets the care of a Shakespearean sonnet, but all sex scenes (and consensual, fulfilling sex scenes, mind. Not just the bad/coerced sex scenes) are devoid of the flowery language found in the rest of the book. For me, this was wildly awkward.And awkward language is really the only reason this book gets 4 stars. Outside of that, this book is a triumph. Elliot Page lends his voice (literally. I listened to the audiobook read by Page himself) to the collection of writings on being trans, which is a very small collection indeed. This comes with its own unique set of expectations, sensitivities, and care, and I think Page navigated all of that masterfully while also tackling both the injustice and the privilege he has experienced. What a difficult thing to do, and yet, somehow, Page knocked it out of the park....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,Jul 2023,Oct 2023,"Jun 15, 2023",,Audible Audio,view (with text),/book/show/175326585-pageboy

I dislike books that are so satirical that they gaze up their own orifices to oblivion. If I had read interviews with Kuang before I had picked this book up I might have been warned.

I read as much when I went down a context rabbit hole to try and situate myself with my interpretations of the text vs R.F. Kuangs intentions. Yellowface starts with our main character, June Hayward, feeling sorry for herself. She and her frenemy Athena Liu are both writers who met while in college at Yale. Difference is, Athena skyrocketed into the upper echelons of the publishing world shortly after graduation. June has been languishing in the shadows. June starts as a sympathetic character who harbors what seems to be legitimate anger with the publishing world (though she does displace that anger on Athena). As the book goes on, June becomes cartoonishly racist and vile, and I honestly can't tell if that's just us getting more introduced to the character, of it that was Kuang's/her editor's decision to make her less and less sympathetic. It just became a toxic wasteland of resentment and jealously and racism and finger pointing and fictional Twitter threads and it wasn't for me.

No formal education? No problem! She's naturally brilliant and naturally beautiful. This seems to be a thing with chick lit books these days: women who are gorgeous but unaware of it, and are the smartest person in the world despite being raised by seagulls (see Where The Crawdads Sing). I hate this new trend. Who cares how beautiful/uggo our protagonist is? And no, I'm sorry, if you were raised by carnies, you aren't the smartest person in the world. That's just wildly improbable.These gripes aside, this book really is a fun read. Mostly because our main character just can't wrap her mind around the misogynistic bullshit around her. It's wonderful to see very real sexism and then have a female main character slice through it with simple a simple ""why"" or ""that isn't rational"" or a No. 2 pencil (see book for more on that). The book makes a neat little circle of its plot, with entwined characters and the growth of everyone around Elizabeth Zott. Zott could've used some growth too, but she doesn't seem to get there. That's okay, though. I was here for the bubbles, not a Bildingsroman. Zott's dog and daughter are outrageously fictional, but they were lovely complements to her larger-than-reality personality. Lessons in Chemistry is a perfect plane/beach read. You can leave in the middle of a sentence and drop right back in. I don't know how it'd stand up if read in the dead of winter by the fire; I do think I read it under ideal circumstances.

The big issue is that a lot of the nutrition advice is suspect. When someone tells me I should be regularly fueling with things like brown rice syrup, quinoa flour, and sprouted whole grain toast, my eyebrows go wwaaayy up.

""Participate in an ultra run for an article? I'm a marathon runner, bish. That sounds dumb.""But then he couldn't stop thinking about it. He called the magazine back, strapped on some shoes, and fell in love with the ultra running world. So he hatched a book plan: immerse himself in ultra running, all while striving to gain entry into the coveted UTMB race. A race so prized, you have to compete in several other sanctioned races to accrue enough points to even qualify to enter. If this sounds weirdly gate-keepy and money-grabby, I mean, it is. And Finn talks about it. Finn spends 2 years training and racing and meeting all sorts of people in the ultra running world. He doesn't shy away from speaking on the dangers of the sport: injury, heart scarring (?!?!), exposure, etc., while also describing the special nature of running in the woods and over mountains and along cliffs, pushing your body and mind to its limits. I do feel this book is billed incorrectly. More than anything, this book is a memoir. It's Finn's personal journey into the world of ultra running, with some special guests. Also there was one thing I really, really didn't like about this book. Finn has a section where he's talking about the starting line of ultra runs: everyone is white. Meanwhile you look at road marathons and there are way more POC/African competitors. Why is that, he asks? Having already written a book about Kenyan runners, Finn went to Africa to try and recruit some folks to run a 50mi race. Thing is, a big driver for competing in road marathons is the prize money. Ultra running doesn't really have that. The sponsorship gigs aren't as robust, and the prize money is basically nonexistant. Finn convinces a runner to come out and run a 50mi race in England. If he wins, Finn says, he'll get entry into a race in CA. That race will have a $10K prize for the winner.Sheesh.So the runner agrees and shows up in England. The race is a 10mi loop done 5 times. The first loop, the runner is in the middle of the pack. The second loop, he's in third place. As he comes around at mile 30, he's in 1st. He stops at the tent, sits down, and says he's going to stop. Finn pushes. The runner replies: ""my toe hurts. I'm stopping."" Finn keeps pushing, but, and good for the runner, he stands firm. A few pages later Finn is like ""Ultra running is pain so I didn't get it. But I guess he didn't want to risk injury because his body is his livelihood.""NO SHIT, FINN! This whole bit just felt gross. Finn wanted this story in his book: grab a marathon runner from Africa and plop him in an ultra race and see what he does. The marathon runner dropping out didn't fit into his narrative, and so he got bossy and obnoxious. But, like, dude. Fucking seriously? This guy and his entire family rely on his body and its ability to perform in road races. There is literally 0 reason for him to push himself to injury for this worthless trail run. Check your privilege. Get fucked. Also the irony considering Finn's own, initial reaction to participating in the sport. Like, what?!?! JFC!Whew. Ok. Got riled up there.So that vignette left a really bad taste in my mouth and left a stain on the entire book for me. Was it a fun, personal insight into ultra running? Yes.

She began running as a teen, and her ability, grit, and dedication led her to Stanford, and then under Nike's payroll. However, because she's a woman she was often undervalued, ignored, and expected to professionally present like a man (that is: not get pregnant, not have curves/soft bits to her body, not bring up menstruation despite the fact that a woman's period affects performance). This book is her examination of all that time, what it meant to be a female athlete then, and what it could mean in the future.I ate this book up. Anyone who enjoys running, or struggles with body image, or struggles with disordered eating, or struggles with expectation, will see themselves in Fleshman's narrative.We don't talk about the unique pressures that are put on female athletes. Our bodies hold more fat because of our biological ability to carry children. To demand we shed all fat is asinine. There is an expectation that women need to accept that they must be thin and that they will be sexualized and objectified regardless if they're walking along the beach or if they're a professional athlete. I never put too much thought into the fact that female running kits are glorified bathing suits themselves. Why? And why did Fleshman have to fight so hard to run in what felt best to her: loose shorts. Because leering men. Folks should be focused on female performance, not female bodies. We still have a long way to go.My one gripe is the section toward the end of the book that just felt like a list of accomplishments / low key advertisements for her endeavors outside of racing: the nut bars she made and marketed, the blog she created that took off, her partnership with Oiselle. I think it was her way of being like ""ah, I want to end this book but I have all this other stuff to say. Shit. Ah, well, here's a quick rundown!"" But it felt rushed and had a different tone than the rest of the book. A tone that, if taken out of context, sounded a bit like ""look at me I'm amazing I'm so smart and successful wheeee."" I'd hate to say it was off-putting, but, like, it wasn't not, you know? I honestly don't think she meant it, but I wish her editor had tweaked that section. My petty grumblings aside, I really loved this memoir. Fleshman bares her soul to us: how disordered eating alters how you view yourself and food, how we can get so focused on an outcome or goal that we lose our ""why."" These are incredibly difficult things to discuss with a therapist, nevermind in a book that's going out into the world for everyone to read. But she did. She should be so proud. Her father would be, too. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Apr 23, 2023",May 2023,"Apr 06, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60880793-good-for-a-girl

Abraham It's weird that I'd describe a ~715 page book as ""tight,"" but that's what I had to say when I turned the final page of The Covenant of Water. Abraham Verghese's book is long, yes, but it covers 77 years and richly fleshes out a dozen characters as its reader follows a family through generational trauma and perseverance. I feel rather lacking trying to describe this book, but I'll try. We begin with a child bride, agonizing about leaving her mother and being essentially sold off to a much older man. She must learn to be wife to him and mother to his small child, while being a child herself. From there, we track her family as the tree branches out across time and territory, the central focus of the book shifting as each generation comes of age. There's a lot of history in this book, and a lot of medicine. Some of the medicine bits were kinda sorta super gross, but Verghese is a doctor by training, so I guess he isn't shy when it comes to chatting about flaying tendons or whatever the fuck. That said, The Covenant of Water still achieves beauty. It is about survival, about finding oneself in the darkness, about faith in oneself when all other faith has run out. It's about the complicated web of family and tradition and expectation, and, above all, it's about love. Despite the sheer number of characters we meet, Verghese keeps a steady hand as he walks us between settings and points of view. I never felt lost, even when we left Parambil for so many pages to meet a man who, at least at first, felt apart from the central narrative. And that's where the beauty of this book really sings: the cohesion. Every piece of this book is thoughtfully planned, so that in the end we step back to see the mosaic that was forming before us all along. If the book weren't as long as it is, and if I weren't itching to dive into a new world, I might have been tempted to flip to the beginning and start the book anew, with all its secrets revealed. Is this  meandering and unhelpful? I'm not sorry. To explain too much about the book is to give it away. Suffice to say The Covenant of Water tells 3 separate coming-of-age stories about a tiny family in Parambil, complete with their intricacies, secrets, and ""the Condition"" which plagues them. If you like dramatic fiction, just go out and read it. There is pain in this book, yes, but the pain, like the rest of the book, is thoughtful. No tragedy porn here, for which I am deeply relieved. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Sep 26, 2023","Oct 14, 2023","Mar 16, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/62687857-the-covenant-of-water

But I am so devastatingly disappointed that I'm putting it down for a while. I can't read it at night, it gets under my skin too much. When I have the mental fortitude, I might try to finish it... we'll see. I went out and bought this book from my local bookstore after hearing author Ruby Warrington on Jameela Jamil's fantastic podcast ""I Weigh."" Warrington and Jamil's conversation was electric for a woman like me: mid-30s and in a marriage where we decided not to have children. In the podcast, they discussed the family you choose vs. the family you are born into, the state of the climate and the world, how individualistic priorities can be. I am so sick of people asking me ""why"" when I say I don't have kids. It doesn't make any sense to me why folks think they have the right to ask me to defend my life choices. I hear it almost as much as I hear ""but do you get enough protein"" when folks find out I'm a pesca-mostly-vege-tarian. So I ran to the bookstore to read a book where I would see myself reflected. Despite how deeply seen I felt listening to the aforementioned podcast, I felt abandoned reading this book. Warrington makes grand, sweeping claims that are backed up by nothing. Most women who don't have children bonded more with their fathers?! What?! No, bish. Women who don't have children are introverts? Ha! As if. Women who don't have children are...Stop trying to define us! There is no ""look"" to women without children. I thought that was the point???It felt like she was trying to answer that ""why"" that women without children are often met with. Which is so besides the point in my opinion. We don't owe anyone the ""why."" Let's talk about the ""how"" and celebrate different families. That's another thing, she treats the word ""family"" as one that pertains to units with children. No. I have a family. It's me and my husband. Full stop.A large part of this book is basically a memoir. False advertising. I'm really tired and really frustrated. I just wanted a book that celebrated all the things a woman without kids is, rather than focus on what she isn't. Warrington says she interviewed many people, but I haven't heard from hardly any of them more than halfway through the book. I guess we have to start somewhere with this conversation, but I don't want anyone in my life to read this book. It honestly feels like it would give those people a free pass to pathologize me, which is exactly what I'm trying to avoid. This book could have been a triumph. It was a let down. ...more",Notes are private!,3,86,1,"Apr 08, 2023","Apr 10, 2023","Mar 12, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60827550-women-without-kids

Hmm...Babel tells the story of Robin Swift (that's not his true name. It's a name he was forced to give himself to fit into the British world). Robin is a young boy spirited away from his motherland of Canton, China to be trained up to attend Babel. What is Babel? A language & translation school housed within Oxford. His education and lifestyle is paid for; he's guaranteed a life of comfort so long as he sticks to Babel's script. Turns out that's not so easy.The world Kuang builds in Babel is uncanny valley territory. It's fashioned after the real world as it was in the 1830s, but massive changes have been made. The most glaring is the Babel school itself. Sitting in the middle of Oxford, Babel is a giant tower, bigger on the inside than it appears on the outside, that houses all of the translation students and the wealth of silver they horde like dragons. You see, Kuang's world is magical. The world runs on silver bars that, when inscribed with ""match pairs"" of words in different languages, can do anything from power the lights of London to make you invisible like you're Harry Potter darting around Hogwarts. It's a clever device, not just because it allows us to feel closer with the main characters (they are, after all, living in a parallel of our world), but because magic is a smart teaspoon of sugar to make the medicine go down. The medicine, in this case, is the following message: fuck the rich. Fuck imperialism. Fuck racism. Fuck your capitalistic society. Burn it all down. So much rage in such a beautiful package. It's genius. Speaking of genius, Kuang has that in spades in the etymology department. I loved every single time she stepped back and explained the history and meaning behind certain words. You'd think it would get exhausting. It never does. I thought about knocking a star off because there are two ""planning"" sections of this book that drag. In order to move the timeline along and get us from one plot point to the next, Kuang spends several pages giving us internal monologues and breakdowns of daily tasks/chores. It wasn't necessary and was a bit repetitive. Those sections could have been cut in my opinion. That said, I finished the book and immediately wanted to read it again, so, I'm wrong.

That I'd get a couple of short stories I would not have otherwise read, and then get a fabulous deep dive into those stories and the authors and environments behind them.What I got were fantastic stories written by Russian behemoths that were book-ended by the inane ramblings of a person ill-equipped to discuss these stories. Saunders' interpretation of ""analysis"" seems to equate to ""I'm going to re-hash the story we just read, talk about myself for a while, and then maybe give you the tiniest morsel of information about the author and the world surrounding the story when it was written."" Saunders' sections were a letdown, but Chekov, Turgenev, and Tolstoy delivered (I wasn't keen on Gogol's The Nose, and, judging by Saunders' lack of real discussion of the story, other than saying ""why?"" a lot, he isn't either). If you haven't yet read The Singers or Master and Man you're missing out. Also ending on Alyosha the Pot was a great idea; the story brought tears to my eyes. I'm crediting Saunders' editor with that choice.Am I coming down too hard on Saunders? I honestly don't think so. I'm not sure Saunders deserves much at the end of the day. These passages made me groan out loud: Any story that suffers from what seems like a moral failing (that seems sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, pedantic, appropriative, derivative or another writer's work, and so on) will be seen, with sufficient analytical snooping, to be suffering from a technical failing, and if that failing is address, it will (always) become a better story. AndIf you're a pro-immigration person, are there anti-immigration feelings down there inside you? Of course: that's why you get so emotional when arguing for immigrants' rights. You're arguing against that latent part of yourself.

So... 3 stars because I wasn't misled.But that doesn't mean I particularly enjoyed this book.My main issue is that Scott Jurek seems to be an incredibly selfish partner. The first indication of this is that the cover of the book say ""by Scott Jurek"" with a tiny ""with Jenny Jurek"" beneath it. Well, Jenny opens the book up and closes every single chapter. Why the fuck aren't they sharing equal billing? Because, when it came to this journey, Jenny certainly shouldered more than she should have. Fresh off another miscarriage, her husband drags her into the woods to oftentimes just be alone, cold, and dirty, in a shitty black van that's serving as his dumping/sleeping grounds during an ill-planned attempt to re-discover the glory of his youth. They were both hurting, they were both listless, and so Scott ran into the woods with the excuse of wanting to break a record on a trail he hardly knew at all. In doing so, he abandoned his wife. He expected Jenny to just be there for him. Forget her pain. Forget her needs. She literally misses medical follow ups for her D&C surgery for Scott. Like, what? What the actual fuck? Who is this guy? He also casually mentions so many promises he made her that he ultimate broke. Examples include making her miss a dear friend's wedding and making her spend her birthday taking care of him and his stupid ""goals.""I actually had to Google pretty early on to see if they're still together (they are) because I was just so angry with how Jenny is treated. And that's how she and Scott were willing to have their relationship portrayed in a book. How much worse is it when it's not presented to the public??I agree with Scott's detractors during his record attempt: people should take their time with the AT. Racing it takes the heart out of it. You can see it in the book: it sounds like he hardly even registered some of the most spectacular parts of the trail (such as the Whites in NH) because he was so physically and mentally fucked up from moving at such a grueling pace. They talk about how he smelled like vinegar because his body was breaking down amino acids/muscle and was actively cannibalizing itself. Like, bro, what? Why? Why are you doing this? What is this goal really about? Or are you just running away from your life?The more I write, the more I want to knock a star off, but I'm not going to. I could see this book resonating for some people, and, again, this book was what it claimed to be. I just felt that Scott Jurek came off like, as his name suggests, a real jerk. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jul 21, 2023","Jul 28, 2023","Jan 18, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34219858-north

Alex Stern has found herself matriculating at Yale University. She doesn't belong, and she knows it. But a free, Ivy League education is hard to pass up, even if you were only given the spot because you can see dead people. What?? Well, Alex was recruited by Lethe, a secret society that serves as a sort of watchdog for the other secret societies on campus. The purpose of a watchdog house, however, isn't to police wild keg parties. Naw, Lethe attends all of the dark magic rituals that secret societies dabble in.This is brilliant. If magic was real, of course the ultrawealthy would have harnessed and horded it to protect and multiply their wealth, power, and chokehold on society.

Or is it a premonition? Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah has built a believable dystopian future. In it, incarcerated individuals are given a choice: rot in prison, where new torture devices are liberally used, or sign up for CAPE, a new reality television series where prisoners are forced to fight to the death, gladiator style. ""Choice"" is a generous word here, for reasons best left to the book to unpack.While Chain-Gang All-Stars primarily follows two incarcerated women participating in the games, Thurwar and Hurricane Staxxx, Adjei-Brenyah gives us several other perspectives. The book is a veritable viewpoint kaleidoscope, the better to paint his world. We see through the eyes of several other incarcerated people as they decide to join CAPE and perish in its stadiums, board meetings by investors/owners of the Games, protestors, and spectators. Adjei-Brenyah also uses footnotes to give both context to his characters and provide several real-life examples of the law's violent abuse of people. In doing this, he breaks that fiction wall, reminding us that this book isn't mere entertainment, it's telling a story that we may very well be building toward in our real world. Chain-Gang All-Stars overflows with humanity and heart. It grapples with fear, feelings of self-worth, suicidal ideation, regret, and love. Somehow, though, this book is primarily a piece of cultural criticism. Readers are encouraged to think critically about how we as a society value human life; how racism, classism, and sexism are oppression; how our cultural obsession with reality TV and disregard for incarcerated people could allow for this exact reality in the not-too-distant future.

He is a true expert in all thinJames Shapiro is an English professor at Columbia and is NYC's Shakespeare Scholar in Residence at the Public Theater. He is a true expert in all things William Shakespeare.I was drawn to this book for a couple of reasons: 1. Shakespeare, obviously. I received my Masters in English, sure, but we didn't talk much about Shakespeare the person in class. Who was he? How did he come up with these plays? What was going on around him?2. The year 1606. I've spent a lot of time researching and reading about the 1400s - 1600s, but the early 1600s in particular are fascinating. I'm perversely drawn to King James for all his women hating narcissistic bullshit. To have him framed around Shakespeare's plays, the plague, and other goings on in the year 1606 was too good to pass up.And that's just what this book tackles. Of course, Shapiro has to expand his lens to provide a holistic picture of time, place, and person, but we really are following the year 1606: how The Gunpowder Plot affected politics, what the religious climate looked like, what plague was doing to the people, what theater looked like, how the monarchy was changing under this new Scottish king, and how the plays Shakespeare wrote during that time captured the moment. Shapiro argues that Shakespeare likely penned 3 plays during 1606: King Lear, Macbeth, and Antony and Cleopatra (I say ""argues"" because there is some difference in expert opinion regarding when the latter two were conceived). What I loved most about Shapiro's discussion of these plays is the acknowledgment that Shakespeare was rebooting shit. I. Fucking. Knew it. YOU HERE THAT, PEOPLE WHO ATTENDED GRAD SCHOOL WITH ME?! I FUCKING TOLD YOU. Ahem. Bragging rights aside, this is invaluable insight into Shakespeare's process. Did you know there was a play called King Leir from which Shakespeare pulled heavily? Or that a book about the relationship of Antony and Cleopatra had recently come out and that full lines were lifted from that book and incorporated into Shakespeare's play on the same topic?? Next time I get all bent out of shape that they're making yet another Halloween movie, I'll have to remember that.I thoroughly recommend this book, with the caveat that the subject matter might not be fascinating for everyone.

The people and events within its pages existed/occurred in the 500s (yes. The 500s), so much of what we know is cobbled from poetry, lore, and letters, not just contemporaneously, but also from relics hundreds of years later, as chroniclers and fanboys furnished their own re-tellings. Shelley Puhak researched as much as she could to flesh out the lives of Brunhild and Fredegund, two Queens who fought to retain their rule while the men around them were cut down with frightening speed and regularity. However, Puhak was reluctant to take much license in her writing, leaving us, her readers, with a text that is rather dry and plodding. A ""this happened, then this happened, then this guy died, then this bishop was sneaky,"" sort of birds-eye view. Personally, I'd have preferred more liberal extrapolations for better narrative flow and a more compelling story, but I respect Puhak's dedication to accuracy. It just didn't make this a page turner.Gripes about sterile recounting aside, credit where credit is due. Puhak saw a gaping hole in the historical record and strove to fill it with an accessible book. And Puhak can write. The prologue and epilogue are fantastic commentaries on the sexism of academics, on the lack of insight into what it must be to be a woman in power, protecting your babies and trying to hold onto your rule, and on the lack of care we as a culture have paid to women in history. It's clear Puhak could have really given oomph to the flesh and blood of Brunhild and Fredegund if she had wanted, but she resolved to stay true to the facts.

If you read too fast, you might miss some fantastic nuggets, such as the fact that this guy Duke Philip signed all his letters ""farewell, turds.""The task Dan Jones set for himself was hefty: write a succinct overview of the entirety of the Middle Ages. He chose to tackle the assignment by breaking the book up into parts centered around themes.Part I introduces populations at the beginning of the Middle Ages, which he defines as ""Romans,"" ""Barbarians,"" ""Byzantines,"" and ""Arabs."" It's a very high level view of who was alive at that time, and what their societies looked like. Jones is setting the stage.Part II introduced classes of people: Franks (which discusses king, emperors, popes, and vikings), Monks (focusing on religious professionals), Knights (aka those who fought for hire, and those who evolved into noblemen), and Crusaders (the fighters and the holy men who waged a global war in the purported name of their God). Part III gives us another cohort of people: Mongols, Merchants, Scholars, and Builders... they're pretty self-explanatory, I think.We wrap with Part IV, which is organized by major events: Survivors (plague, revolution, the Little Ice Age), Renewers (significant men in The Arts), Navigators (all those explorers of the time: Marco Polo, Christopher Columbus, Magellan), and Protestants (that little Christian revolution).The war bits / throne successions got a little dull for me (this guy ruled then got sick and died so then it was this guy but he was swiftly dispatched so his baby became king...). Dull though I may have found those bits, they were pivotal to moving the story long. As society shifted and evolved, the people in power were the primary hands shaping that world. This book is one of many on the Middle Ages, but it excels at giving its audience an engaging, broad strokes narrative of the year 400 AD - 1527. Jones' writing is at its strongest when he focuses on a singular person and takes poetic license to get into their head and their environment. He can really bring history to life, which is a feat for any history book. His bibliography serves as a ""see more"" section. If there were stories/events/people you wanted to delve into more deeply, Jones has you covered.At the top of the book, Jones wrote: ""I am going to ask - and I hope to answer - some big questions: What happened in the Middle Ages? Who ruled? What did power look like? What were the big forces that shaped people's lives? And how (if at all) did the Middle Ages shape the world we know today? There will be times when that may feel a bit overwhelming.But I promise you, it is going to be fun.""He kept his promise....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jun 02, 2023","Jun 29, 2023","Nov 30, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57347786-powers-and-thrones

Much of their history has eroded with the sands of time. But Neil Price could have done more here.

He'll edge into something interesting, say, this wild burial site of a female warrior, but then he'll just shrug and be like ""well, that's a thing. MOVING ON."" What??? Despite his inability to make assumptions for the sake of a compelling narrative, he still manages to jump to insane possible conclusions that bewilder and offend his readers. Price is all ""we know so little of the Vikings, you never know, women could have been very powerful and equals in their society."" Then goes on to say ""we do know that women were enslaved and raped and forced to stay at home."" Ok, bro, which is it? Why are you trying to make Vikings a woke culture? No one expects that! I knuckled down and really read the first 300 pages, but I got so bored I had to skim the latter 200.

But I wasn't prepared for how dark.Things that really get the sadness roaring in my ears is neglected children and neglected old people. Demon Copperhead has neglected children galore. Poor Tommy made me cry. Little Damon searching for love and getting kicked in the teeth again and again? Heart wrenching. Because that's what this story is about: the impoverished and forgotten children of America. How we treat and mistreat them, what they need and what they get. It's all too real. The fact that Kingsolver takes the story of a sad little boy and weaves into it classism, racism, corporate-sponsored poverty, and the opioid epidemic? Astonishing.

Susan Wise Bauer tackles Europe, Asia, North Africa, and even a bit of the Americas as she spans the years 312 - 1129. Yep, you read that right. Wise Butler tackled almost a millennia in her 666 paged book (and yes, I did chuckle at that number, especially since Christianity has a starring role within these pages).Unfortunately, because she is spanning such an insane time frame, and because record keeping wasn't exactly a priority when folks were getting pillaged and burned down all the time, there isn't much depth to these pages. I kind of felt like an alien, circling Earth, watching as the decades melt by, with kingdoms rising and falling in a blink of an eye. Not many of the names in this text stick, because they're only on the scene for a few pages, if that.

I loved the vignette about Leif Erikson, but that's all we could really call it, because it only lasted ~4 pages. Yes, I'll admit, I skimmed at times, especially sections that were particularly ""King Man ruled but then got murdered, his murderer took the throne but then his wife's lover pushed him off it. Loverboy ruled but was poisoned..."" and on and on. It did get a bit tedious to read.

Why do I continue to read him when it seems I find his books just okay?This is where the starring system sort of breaks down. The reason Stephen King gets 3 stars is not because his books are just okay. King is great at writing dialogue. He excels at writing stressful, fast-paced scenes. He masterfully weaves tension into complicated and interesting conflicts. The reason Stephen King gets 3 stars is because these excellent storylines with interesting characters always have a giant flaw that I can't get around. A flaw that threatens to unravel the entire story if you look at it too closely. Fairy Tale is no different. This story is different than many of Kings other books. It's a dark fantasy more than anything else. An adventure story dappled with all old fairy tales that many of us will find familiar. Our main character, Charlie, is a 17yr old who is in over his head. His youthful naivety and optimism is just what this book needs. Who else could be a hero? The beginning is great. A boy who grew up in a difficult household, a household that made him special, finds himself helping the crotchety old man down the road. This old man reveals a secret that forever changes Charlie's trajectory.And then Charlie makes a choice.A choice that makes no sense.And the rest of the narrative I was stuck thinking ""I'm enjoying this... but what brought Charlie here makes no sense. Who would make this choice?"" And King seems to know that his readers will struggle with this choice. The book is written in the first person, with Charlie writing all of this down for us. Thanks to this, Charlie breaks the fourth wall with the reader a few times. ""I know what you're thinking,"" he says, addressing the camera like he's Zack Morris, ""but remember I'm just a 17yr old kid, and this made sense to me."" DID IT, THOUGH ?! DID IT REALLY ?!Sigh.I'm not going to spoil anything. Suffice to say Fairy Tale is yet another book that is a really interesting story but makes no sense.

Again, that's totally fine! But the witch thing felt like a click-baity way to get folks who wouldn't have otherwise picked up the book to check it out. Like many theory books, it got a bit repetitive. And some of it actually felt a bit dated. Mona Chollet lives in France, so perhaps the expectations for women are different between our cultures, but certains passages felt like Chollet was hearkening back to the 80s and 90s, rather than focusing in on present-day issues. PS. Any publishers wanting a book that actually tackles the 1400 - 1700 witch, like, hit me up.

Is there conflict? I mean, some, but this book is mostly about being comfortable with yourself and finding your people and your home. This is what a wholesome, hug-of-a-book looks like. Everyone yammering about Under the Whispering Door is an idiot.The Very Secret Society... tells of the story of Mika Moon. She is a witch and she is an orphan. In fact, all witches are orphans due to a protection spell run amok generations ago. In a further effort to protect themselves, witches do not spend much time together. To be alone is to be safe. When Mika, lonely-but-managing, receives a curious message inviting her to teach 3 young witches, she can't help but be enticed. 3 witches? Together? And how did the sender of this message know she's a witch?? A heartwarming romp ensues. I won't say much more. This book is part coming-of-age (okay, so Mike is 31yrs old in the book. But she was never given the opportunity to explore herself before now, so let's roll with it), part romance, and part hot-cup-of-tea-by-the-fire-with-a-blanket. You'll read most of it with a small smile on your lips... and isn't that refreshing?Not everything is tied up at the end of the book, but that's OK. That's life.

How to sum up how this book simultaneously annoyed me but also gently reminded me to slow down and enjoy the time I have?Here goes nothing.Under the Whispering Door tells the story of Wallace Price. Wallace Price is a high-powered lawyer who is cruel, selfish, and completely oblivious to the concept of humanity. He's despicable. Then he dies. But his journey has only just begun.I liked the things TJ Klune had to say about death and grief and what it all means. Reading this book affords you moments of introspection: what really matters to you in your life? Are you tending to those things? Do you approach the world with kindness? Do you stop and feel, with each of your senses, the world and the wonder around you? That alone would have made this book a 4-star-er for me, if Klune hadn't made the choice to explore this idea 26 different times in under 400 pages with similar conversations that petered out in the exact same way. Reading the acknowledgments made me understand: Klune wrote this book as a sort of catharsis to grief he was processing at the time. So these conversations are like him talking to himself about life and death. It was repetitive within him, so it became repetitive in the book. It didn't serve the book.The characters of Norman and Mei were fun and interesting and lovable, but Norman is an old man and Mei is a young woman who grew up with completely different experiences. Yet Norman, Mei, the aforementioned Wallace, and the not-yet-mentioned Hugo all speak exactly the same. The same colloquialisms. The same quips and one liners. These people would never ever have the same voice in real life. I think they're all speaking like Klune, which was distracting and an odd choice. Now we're going to circle to the thing that I really had a problem with, which is Wallace Price himself. Like I said, he's despicable in the beginning. After death, however, we are expected to consider him a likeable protagonist. Bitch, please. After, like, 3 days of death, he's cracking jokes and cuddling dogs and forging bonds with the people around him. His ex-wife basically spit on his grave at his funeral. He ruined the life of a coworker over a tiny mistake. This vile person would not all of a sudden be fun and helpful and loving in mere DAYS after a DECADE+ of being a piece of shit. It just doesn't track. I was supposed to root for him, but I couldn't. All I could do was stare at the book in confusion. If Klune wanted this journey for Wallace, he should have made Wallace cold and distant because of past hurts. You know, shelling himself off so he isn't hurt more by the world. Making him a sociopath and then undoing it in UNDER A WEEK was lunacy and I'm angry about it.Okay. We can move on.So, where does this leave us? Under the Whispering Door was a lovely idea: give the world a story about death that is hopeful and reverent of life. That said, it fell very short in its characterizations, most glaringly how horrible the lead was, and, if you ask me, still is at the close of the novel....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Dec 27, 2022","Jan 03, 2023","Oct 17, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53205888-under-the-whispering-door

Harvest Home is one of those bHow to describe a very well-written, very good book that was ruined by one graphic, unnecessary scene?I'm going to try. Harvest Home is one of those books that should have already been adapted into a film (ok, I know, there was a made-for-TV movie in 1978, but I mean, like, a real film). The elements are classic: outsiders come to an insular community; weirdness ensues.The book is first-person narration. Our story teller is Ned, a city man who got sick of the grind and so he and his family (his wife Beth, and his teenage daughter Kate) decide to move to the country to get away from it all. Minor plot hole about how they had enough money for Ned to straight up quit his job and then just... paint all day? We'll forgive it.The village of Cornwall Coombe is stuck in the past (the ""present,"" in this case, is 1973). The townspeople follow ancient traditions and their lives, it seems, revolve around corn growing and harvesting. Everyone here grows corn, and the survival of the town hinges upon the crop. Ned and Beth are super into it. ""Look how simple and wonderful this is!"" they say. When they find out the town also listens to little Missy, a 14yr old ""touched"" girl who does things like plunge her hands into the entrails of a chicken to read the future, Ned sees it as a red flag. Beth is like ""oh, that's just country folk!"" ...c'mon Beth.Sufficiently freaked out by Missy, Ned decides to dig into the history of Cornwall Coombe, and uncovers more mysteries than he solves. It's here that the book really starts to pick up. I say that because Harvest Home is a slow-burn book. This can be tiresome in other books, but author Thomas Tryon is such an adept writer you don't mind the smolder here. The town is described in full technicolor, complete with all the main players and their histories and eccentricities. I have never read a horror/thriller book where the author actually bothers to build in rich scenery. I was harassing anyone who would listen about this book. It's creepy AND it's beautifully written? Slam dunk!Because Ned is our first-person narrator, we're never quite sure what's real and what's not. Are there supernatural elements to this town? Or perhaps there are logical explanations to what Ned is experiencing? Or perhaps he's going crazy? You don't know, and you waffle between the choices, eager to see how it's going to turn out.But then.Usually I'd put a spoiler tag on at this juncture, but the next part is so egregious I feel compelled to spell it all out as a warning. If you want to decide for yourself, skip this next paragraph.But then Ned decides to do something that makes absolutely no sense and absolutely ruined the book for me. He suspects a woman of doing something, and so he attacks her. It seems like he's going to murder her, which falls in line with the ""madness"" choice. To be clear: I accepted that the narrator might commit murder. But then he stops. He decides he doesn't want to just murder her. So he... has sex with her. And, because it's written in the first person, we know that Ned isn't just having sex with her, he is trying to fuck her to death. I'm not kidding. That's what he thinks. It's graphic and horrible and upsetting and... just... why? It didn't move the plot along. If Tryon wanted to make sure Ned was no longer a sympathetic character, there were better mechanisms than this. You see I said ""sex"" and not ""rape."" This is because the scene suggests the woman is consenting, despite how violent and disgusting the scene is (remember how descriptive I said this book is? Yeah, well, so is this scene). Later, though, the woman does accuse Ned of rape and the town... doesn't arrest him/do anything/react that much? I know it's the 1970s but what the actual hell. I... I just don't understand the purpose of this scene other than Tryon wanting to write a traumatic sex scene. It was all so needlessly graphic. I'm still giving the book 3 stars because the book was wonderful, that's right, WONDERFUL, except for this one scene. But no mental gymnastics can get me to the place where I see the point. A solid 4 star book loses an entire star for this single, repugnant vignette. Okay, I'm done.The resolution to Ned's digging is tight, the ending is good, and the revelations of the town are satisfying. Harvest Home is a horror/thriller book with flourish. It's a tale about a town with secrets, and it could have been great if the author wasn't sick in the head. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Oct 10, 2022","Oct 19, 2022","Oct 10, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/41392423-harvest-home

And, yeah, there were times where Jennette McCurdy's writing was so blunt and honest that I had to take a break. But her approach (leaning into the voice of the moment (childish when she was a child, etc.), simplistic sentence structure and language) resulted in a powerful narrative about a very difficult life. Jennette McCurdy grew up kind of poor in a hoarder household. When I say ""kind of"" I mean she always had a roof over her head, but she also learned to worry about money very early because it was a constant topic of discussion underneath said roof. At age 6 her mother pushed her into acting. By age 11 her mother was teaching her how to be an anorexic. Her mother was that special brand of manipulative and loving that is so confusing and heart wrenching to live through. The fact that McCurdy is able to write about it so clearly and truthfully is a testament to how therapy and reflection, when done right, can help with childhood trauma. Look, I'm not gonna talk much more about this.

Their primary job is acting, not writing. They're doing the former really well; should we expect them to excel at the latter? If they were offered money to write up some anecdotes about themselves, why shouldn't they? That's why I wasn't too annoyed back when I read Amy Poehler's seemingly random, slap-dash attempt. She had better things to do, and it was just a paycheck. That's fine. I won't say that Scrappy Little Nobody is a very good memoir ,but it's real, it has some good nuggets, and it is what it is: a reflection written by someone whose job is decidedly NOT writing books. When I started listening to Anna Kendrick's Scrappy Little Nobody I was reading Jennette McCurdy's I'm Glad My Mom Died. I'm not sure I could have found celebrity memoirs that are more polar opposite. McCurdy was forced into show biz by her abusive mother, striving for the love and acceptance she never actually got. Kendrick came up with acting as a career all on her own, and her family regularly ferried her from Maine to NYC to make that dream come true. Her father even moved to New York for a spell while Kendrick was on Broadway, just to support his kid. Kendrick's narrative waffles between her trying-to-make-it era and her I'm-very-famous era. She tells some interesting anecdotes and is endearingly self-deprecating throughout. She missteps, because she's human and, again, writing isn't her job. The one that made me wince was when she was talking about wanting hair like Amanda Bynes: ""in What A Girl Wants, not mugshot."" Woof, Kendrick. Way to punch down on a woman struggling with abusive parents and a mental health crisis. But, again, I honestly don't think Kendrick meant anything by it. In her attempts to come across cool and likeable, she fell into the high-school-reminiscent trap of being mean about other girls because you're, like, so totally not one of them. None of us are perfect. We've all said things we regret. Unfortunately, Kendrick had a few published in a memoir.There were two thoughts she left us with that I really, really loved, and I think Kendrick deserves credit for penning them. The first was Kendrick saying she doesn't care if people consider her a ""nice"" person (the following was scraped off the internet because I'm not rewinding that audiobook to get you a perfect quote. What I'm saying is: I can't say these are 100%, or even in order, but I tried my best):As Sondheim said, Nice is different than good. Do you need to do whatever you’re told to be a nice person? Maybe. Do you need to do whatever you’re told to be a good person? Of course not! Man, woman, personal, professional—some people have a skill for persuading you the best thing you can be is obedient.AndI gave up on being Nice. I started putting more value on other qualities instead: passion, bravery, intelligence, practicality, humor, patience, fairness, sensitivity. Those last three might seem like they are covered by “nice,” but make no mistake, they are not. A person who smiles a lot and remembers everyone’s birthday can turn out to be undercover crazy, a compulsive thief, and boring to boot. I don’t put a lot of stock in nice. I’d prefer to be around people who have any of the above qualities over “niceness,” and I’d prefer it if that applied to me, too. I’m also okay if the most accurate description of me is nervous, and a little salty. But at least I know what I want to strive for.The second thought, which I can't seem to find on the internet (the internet failed me?!?!), was Kendrick reflecting on people talk about wanting to go back to their youth/20s, and how she has no interest in that. She has no interest in being the anxious, insecure, sheep-y person many of us become for a few, feverish years when we're younger. But what really struck me was when she said (paraphrasing, thanks a lot, internet!): ""I'm not confused about what that word [friendship] means anymore."" It hit me like a lightning bolt. So many of us put up with so much shit from people because we think they are our friends. It takes a long time to realize that someone who tears you down; who makes you feel bad for being yourself when yourself is totally normal and not a horrible, sadistic monster; who takes pleasure in your missteps and failures; is no friend at all. Some of us never come to that realization. I think we could all be better served if we took a step back and looked at how we treat our friends, and how our friends treat us. So, thanks Anna Kendrick....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Nov 22, 2022","Sep 21, 2022",,Audible Audio,view (with text),/book/show/31411951-scrappy-little-nobody

Without that categorization, lines blur. We step over the friendship/partner line, trying to decide how much of ourselves to share, whether the relationship has conditions, and partitioning off the parts of ourselves which we dislike/feel shameful about/etc. Gabrielle Zevin's Sadie and Sam can be exasperatingly obtuse in their inability to appropriately communicate... but that's human, isn't it? To jump to conclusions, to fill in gaps, to turtle in on ourselves rather than leave ourselves out there open and vulnerable.Zevin creates a rich world with deep characters. We follow Sadie and Sam for 30 years, from their meeting as children through their late 30s. The pair meet in California, and both attend schools on the east coast (MIT and Harvard, respectively). Though they haven't seen one another in years, they are drawn to one another, to the ease of their partnership, and to how one pushes the other. Thus blooms both a professional and personal entanglement that is complicated and wonderful at the same time. This book is a bit about video games, but it's really just a story about how we grow and change, and whether we take people along with us. And, while the book is primarily focused on Sadie and Sam, Marx is the best character in this book... perhaps one of the better characters I've come across.

Unfortunately, that talent doesn't translate to her first foray into fiction.Small Game tells the story of Mara, who is roped into auditioning for a new survival reality television show. When she is picked, she decides what the hell. There's prize money, and that money could maybe get her out of the life she hates.Why does she hate her life ? We don't know. Braverman doesn't give us much insight into her characters. The book is written in 3rd person limited, focused on Mara, but just barely. We don't get much of her inner thoughts at all. I'm not sure why this choice was made. It really should have been 1st person. Holding every single character at arms length in a narrative that was supposed to be harrowing and intimate was a mistake.Mara arrives at the show with 4 other contestants: Jake, the normie; Kyle, the boyscout; Bullfrog, the old man survivalist; and Ashley, the fame seeker. Want more insight into these characters ? Too bad, you won't get it.My biggest complaints are as follows :- the dialogue is clunky and often doesn't read like people talk.- all of the characters of unlikeable despite being the barest sketch of themselves.- Mara herself.What we know of Mara is an insufferable contradiction. She is meek and pliable externally ; internally she's all ""I'm smarter than everyone here and they may think they have my number but I have THEIR number.""You don't, though, Mara. The book opens with her trapped with a boyfriend she tells us she doesn't like, but we don't see that he's a bad guy. She says she can't leave him because of finances, but she has a job and lives off the land. She doesn't have enough money for a bus ticket? Then, in the survivor show, she allows herself to become the pet of one person, and accepts another person to be a pet of her own. She seems to hate humans in general, but then she becomes obsessed with one of them. None of these interpersonal relationships are unpacked, so it just reads as garbled nonsense. Who is Mara? I don't know.The book was a good idea: survivalist TV show gone amok. But Braverman wasn't able to create a sense of place and person that was believable or interesting or developed. To be clear: I really, really love Braverman's nonfiction, but this book was, unfortunately, a flop....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Nov 23, 2022","Nov 26, 2022","Sep 03, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60277011-small-game

It's the author's writer friends talking about their successes. I tried to read this book chronologically, but the first essay was a person shitting on her friends for having different ambitions than climbing to the top of their profession. What? Why are we shaming people for making their lives full in different ways? Disgusting. The second essay was a long, drawn out complaint about the television industry. Also apparently every single person in the world wants to run their own TV show? Guess I'm not a person of the world.

Her contribution was great. She spoke about dog sledding and how it's a male dominated sport but is also one of the more even playing grounds . It was balanced and interesting and well-written.So I flipped to the back of the book, where the contributor bios lived, to see if there were any other non-writers in this collection.

Her best friend (since they were in high school in the 1940s) saw it and remembered that I had always wanted to be a writer in my youth. So she bought it for me. Is that going to color how I feel about this book? Absolutely.---------------------------------------------------With about 80 pages left, and all of it in the ""Personal"" section of the book, I gotta start talking about this anthology of Nora Ephron.First of all: I wish the person who put this collection together had inserted themselves a few times. I think broader context for some of the more dated and outdated entries would have been helpful. But alas, he stayed silent. So here are my thoughts:Section 1: The JournalistVery interesting - because Ephron was a journalist in the 70s dealing with sexism and the social upheaval of the time, this section provided really great and unapologetic context for that world.Section 2: The AdvocateI cried. It was great. Also, I didn't know that Betty Freidan became such a fractious and narrow-minded figure in her later years.PS. The person who put this collection together put a piece on Ephron's 10th college reunion (1972) right next to her address to the Wellesley Class of 1996. Brilliant and hilarious choice. Section 3: The ProfilerThis was rough to read at times. Look, I get that writing unkindly about women was a ""thing"" for a while, but it's just cringey to read now, especially from someone who, in the previous section, was such a staunch feminist. She writes well here, but I was sort of gobsmacked that she took so many cheap shots at women: how they looked, how their personal lives shaped up. Oh, and her piece on Jan Morris was flat out offensive. This is where I really wish the person who compiled this collection had stepped in. And this is one of the primary reasons I gave this collection 3 stars. The ""profile"" on Lisbeth Salander, however, was hilarious. A good bit of satire. Section 4: The NovelistI'd never read Heartburn before and I really loved it. It's nothing groundbreaking, just a lightly fictionalized retelling of Ephron's own divorce, but the way she wrote it was just so vivid. It underscores how talented of a writer Ephron was. Section 5: The PlaywrightI'd never even heard of the play Lucky Guy but it was a well-written piece about the importance of journalism... and also the egos that exist within that field.Section 6: The ScreenwriterWhen Harry Met Sally is one of my favorite movies, so obviously reading the screenplay was a delight. After the screenplay concludes we get a brief reflective from Ephron, penned in 1990. She breaks down the politics of writing a movie (how many edits you go through, how much the characters of your voices change), and also lifts the curtain a bit on the goings ons with When Harry Met Sally. I did not know that it was Meg Ryan's idea to fake an orgasm in Katz's ; nor did I realize Billy Crystal came up with the famous ""I'll have what she's having line."" Good on Ephron for being honest that these bits don't belong to her. Section 7: The FoodieA lot of dated feelings about food. It was interesting, but definitely weaker than all that preceded it. Section 8: The BloggerMeh. Most of this was written around 2005 - 2007, and it's mostly just rantings about Bush and Watergate. My least favorite section by far; I skimmed it because of that, and also because it was repetitive. Another cornerstone for the 3-star rating. Section 9: PersonalI've still got most of this section left, but I don't think it's going to change my feelings on this collection. These last 80 pages appear to be reflections, almost all of them written towards the end of her life. They're a summation of sorts, of where's she's been and how she defines herself. I pulled a page out of Harry's book, and read the last 2 pages first. They're a list of what she won't miss when she's gone, and what she will. I cried then, too.So, it was good, but there were some problematic things in it that deserved addressing, yet no one did, and that really brought the whole thing down in my opinion. Oh, I almost forgot. At one point she said that men are inherently more funny than women. Interesting how she blasted Friedan for losing touch later in life AND YET, DEAR READER. AND. YET. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Aug 29, 2022","Sep 13, 2022","Aug 29, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17316511-the-most-of-nora-ephron

As this friend put it to me later: ""romance books are comfort reads,"" and she couldn't be more correct in that. In a way it was very refreshing to open up a book and know that there would be a happy ending and the good guys would win and love would prevail.What I really enjoyed:This book has many characters. We're talking at least 10 distinct people running around a fancy Victorian house having a fancy Victorian time. Yet every single character has a unique voice. And I'm not talking Stephen King unique where he forces intense accents where they don't belong; I'm talking true unique voices where each character is their own person and has their own way of addressing others. It proves that Lisa Kleypas is a good writer. If you've ever thought romance as a genre is inherently poorly written, you're wrong. The narrative can be flowery, sure, but not cloyingly so. What I'm trying to say is: this book is well-crafted, and Kleypas has a handle on narration more than authors out there winning accolades and getting high-powered s. Also, when there are miscommunications the characters ACTUALLY TALK TO ONE ANOTHER INSTEAD OF RUNNING AWAY. Do you hear me, every chick flick ever made??? Have a DIALOGUE when there is a misunderstanding. Criminy !The plot is as follows: Daisy needs to find a husband, or her dad is going to marry her off to his (suitably young) business partner. Her dad calls her a parasite which, like, I have to agree. She just wants to hang out in beautiful houses reading books. That's an expensive lifestyle. So Daisy, her sister, and her brother-in-law try and find her a match. However, the business partner who was once an uggo is now a hunka-hunka muscle man. Maybe Daisy isn't so opposed to the arrangement after all...Scandal in Spring is a fun and lighthearted romp of a read. My major qualm with the book is that it tries to introduce high, mortal stakes, which was pointless. We all know this is going to be a happy ending, Kleypas. You don't have to do that. Also, the hunka-hunka muscle man's love for Daisy got borderline weird/creepy/obsessive. But borderline, so we can forgive it. If this  doesn't make sense - it's because I have COVID.

Before I give everything away, I want to say the following:Recent mystery novels give you one, maybe two suspects. Ruth Ware gave us a good 5 believable suspects in The It Girl, and that didn't go unnoticed. This is a murder mystery; an exploding genre in recent years. Most of these books follow the tragic, wonderful young woman getting murdered. Not so here. The ""It"" Girl in question isn't sympathetic in the least, which was refreshing. Shitty people get murdered too. It still not okay, but I think we're all bored of the flawless victim.Hannah, our main character/narrator, is also shitty. Like, really shitty. I might actually... hate her? But to get into that, I'd need to spoil the book. So here we go.(view spoiler)[The It Girl is a flash-forward-flash-back book. For the first half of the novel, we volley between Hannah and her 5 BFFs as they begin their freshman year of college (the BFFs in question being Will, Ryan, Hugh, Emily, and April), and Hannah 10yrs in the future. Why 10yrs? Because April was murdered at the end of their freshman year, and Hannah was a key witness who put the primary suspect in prison. Now, while Hannah is married to Will and they're expecting their first child, the man convicted of April's murder has died in prison. He protested his innocence to the end. The death makes Hannah start to wonder ""hhmmm... what if I was wrong,"" and also some podcaster comes along and basically TELLS her she was wrong. She starts to internalize it, and so begins pulling on threads that unravel almost as fast as her sanity.Because Hannah is unstable. I'm not sure if she's poorly written or if Ware did this intentionally, but Hannah is just a dreadful person and I don't care a lick about her. Here's why:1. She ran away from school. Trauma is horrible. I can't imagine what it's like to lose your freshman roommate to a murder AND to walk in on that murder. But, even in fiction, I can't abide someone abandoning their life and their future when horrible things happen. You can't let this rotten, awful world get between you and what you want. Hannah did.2. Every time suspicion shifts to a different person Hannah ""can see it crystal clear."" Anyone and everyone is a suspect to Hannah, because her head is so up in the clouds and she's so gullible and lacking critical thought that it's inevitable that she can run away with the mere whisper of motive or possible access to murdering April. Take a second! Slow down! Why are you so stupid?? 3. Ryan is one of her dearest friends. He has a horrible, debilitating stroke in his 20s. And Hannah does... nothing. She doesn't keep in touch. She doesn't see what he or his wife or their two tiny babies need. She just doesn't attend to her friend. But when she starts looking back at April's murder she decides it's totally appropriate to show up at his house unannounced and drill him with questions and call him early in the morning TO ACCUSE HER OWN HUSBAND OF A 10YR OLD MURDER. Leave Ryan alone!! With friends like these...4. At the close of the novel there's this great fight-to-the-death. Hugh, the murderer, is trying to shoot Hannah, but then lo! Hannah's husband, who she just that morning accused of being a murderer, appears and begins to wrestle him. What does Hannah do? Continues to stand at the edge of a literal cliff, paralyzed by inaction. Eventually the gun is pushed kind of close to her, so she makes a half-effort to retrieve it, but is unsuccessful. This book should have been called Hannah the Plodding Waste of Space.5. You can't take a bath when you're pregnant unless it's less than 100 degrees. You're not supposed to drink that much coffee. Is pregnancy-shaming this fictional character as low as a person can go? Well, what about victim blaming her? Because that's what Ruth Ware did to her own creation.The man who wasted away in prison for April's murder was a porter from their school: John Neville. Why is he a suspect? Mostly because he was seen leaving April's room minutes before she was found dead. But also because HE STALKED AND ASSAULTED HANNAH AND IT SEEMED LIKE HE WAS GOING TO RAPE HER AT SOME POINT?!?! Once John Neville no longer seemed to be a suspect Ware just sort of shrugged him off in her narrative. She even made him... sympathetic? Toward the close of the novel Hannah says:""I condemned [Neville] for being old, and weird and awkward - and that's on me, don't you understand? That will forever be on me.""WHAT?!?! WHAT?!?!?! WHAT?!?!?!At one point, earlier in the novel, Hannah mentions that multiple women had complained about Neville's stalking and inappropriate behavior. This man was dangerous and should NOT have been working at a school. Should he have died in prison? I suppose not. But him going to prison seems like a WHEN not an IF BECAUSE AGAIN, HE ASSAULTED AND TRIED TO RAPE HANNAH.And, again, the man didn't deserve to rot in prison for a murder her didn't commit, but this isn't black-and-white, like Ware seems to try to force it to be at the close of her book. This man was problematic and awful in so many ways.Hannah accused her husband, Will, of murdering April. His response was to say ""What do you think,"" LAUGH IN HER FACE, AND RUN AT HER. There's a red herring, and then there's absolute lunacy. Then, when Will is actually innocent, they're just cool and in love again? HOW?!?!?! SHE JUST ACCUSED YOU OF MURDER AND THEN YOU ACTED LIKE A MURDERER. Get a divorce. Jesus Christ. Honestly I wish Hugh had gotten away with it all.Moral of the story: don't prank people. Or, if you're gonna prank them, like, put an acorn in their shoe or something.

Chanel Miller did something that feels like it should be impossible: she wrote an entire book about her sexual assault with poise, passion, anger, and hope. She walked us through almost 3 years of her life: from the day she spontaneously decided to go to a Stanford party, through Brock Turner's release from jail and the appeals and the bullshit that followed. It's an incredibly brave and beautiful and horrifying piece of writing that everyone should be reading, even though it'll fuck with your head (seriously, I've been irritable and teary for days and I couldn't figure out why until I realized every time I would sit down to read more of this book I would burst into tears). Also, this book should have ended on page 275. Page 275 tells the parable of the spider and the centipede. It's a wonderful wrap on where Miller has been and where she's going. When I turned the page and realized I had 2 more chapters left, I was a little perplexed. Two more chapters of... what?Of Donald Trump, Bill Cosby, and Brett Kavanaugh.And maybe it's petty for me to knock a star off for this, but giving us a timeline of high-profile sexual aggressors was just so exhausting after everything we had just been through with Miller. And, unlike the rest of the book, it was impersonal and really just a rehashing of a history with which most folks who pick up this book are familiar. Plus, by dragging us into politics, she risks alienating conservative women who could have otherwise found comfort in this book. I'm not saying Miller doesn't have the right to speak her mind about what a misogynistic dumbass Donald Trump is; I'm just saying that aim never seemed to be the central thesis of the book, and we (read: I) didn't need it.

Conversations with Friends is a book about a bunch of selfish and miserable people living out their selfish and miserable lives in Dublin. We have four characters: Melissa, Nick, Bobbi, and Frances. Frances is our main character, so let's save her for last.Melissa is a two-dimensional megabitch who appears in the novel only to be a foil for Frances. Poor Melissa.Nick is a 32yr old baby who is emotionally manipulative while simultaneously being passive AF. How? Beats me.Bobbi is a borderline abusive friend/ex of Frances'. Bobbi is really troublesome, because she is so horrible to everyone in her life... but it's supposed to be funny? #cancelBobbiAnd then there's Frances. Frances is a self-mutilating manic depressive who watches with numb ambivalence as things happen to and around her. It's honestly not worth a deep dive. My main issues with her were: if you're so poor GET A JOB. If you're so worried about your dad DO SOMETHING. If you're in pain SEE A DOCTOR. If these people hurt you YOU CAN LEAVE THEM. She's 20, so she's young and naive, but this was on a whole different level. She lives in a flat in Dublin for free and has her tuition taken care of but doesn't get an allowance to eat for a month and doesn't know what to do. Getting a job doesn't even cross her mind? And, girl, there's always free food at the university. Be creative. Also, just in general GROW THE FUCK UP. If I'm being honest, my main hang up with this book is how it clashes with what I think is good or right behavior. If someone who experienced what happens in this book read it, it would probably resonate, and might be a powerful, literary experience. That's certainly what happened to me with Normal People. All I could think about while reading this book was how badly I wanted to shake Frances out of her passive stupor.

Huge. I've watched the series through several times, and have watched my favorites episodes 10+ times. I What even is this book?I am a BIG Buffy fan. Huge. I've watched the series through several times, and have watched my favorites episodes 10+ times. I know a decent amount about the show, and so was very excited when I heard this book was coming out. I put a hold at the library a full MONTH before the book even came out.All I gotta say is: I am so happy I didn't spend a cent on this pile of garbage. Get ready for a rant. Here are some of my biggest complaints:1) A full third of this book is just Evan Ross Katz summarizing each season of the show. He EXTENSIVELY quotes full scenes from episodes. He's not even breaking them down. He's just like: this happened, then this happened. Check out this scene!  I very much doubt folks are picking up this book unless they've watched the show. Did he have a page count to meet or something? This was asinine. 2) Despite summarizing the entire fucking series... he doesn't know it? One tiny example: he says the character Andrew is Tucker Wells' cousins. They're brothers!!! Evan Ross Katz clearly needs to watch the show again.3) Every opinion Evan Ross Katz has about the show is correct, and any deviating opinions are stupid. Are you a Spike/Buffy fan rather than an Angel/Buffy fan? Well, then, you're the dumbest dumb to ever dumb, according to Evan Ross Katz. Like, what? Art is subjective? Sit the fuck down.4) He is incredibly cruel regarding some the cast members who made themselves available to be interviewed. The most insidious example of this was when Evan Ross Katz was talking to James Marsters about playing Spike. I'm gonna pull a page out of Katz's book, and quote extensively here:But my real disdain for Spike is informed by something James Marsters said in a 2001 E! special titled Buffy's Back... ""The first time Spike saw Buffy, he was hunting her, which has a very sexual undertone,"" he says. ""And I played that very heavily. It's kind of the same thing [as] some man hunting a woman at a bar, looking at her dancing, walking across the bar, and just noticing her. It's both sexual and violent. And I played that."" I get that a vampire has no soul, and for them violence isn't just palatable, it's tasty. But the comparison in real life, and the use of the words ""hunting"" and ""violent"" spoke volumes about Marsters's [sic] worldview at the time, which, if we're keeping it 100, feels grossly misaligned with the show's themes of female empowerment. I'm going to do something that Katz never does in his book: I'm going to break this down.Firstly, Katz contradicts this last sentence later in the book. He questions whether the show is actually about female empowerment, so... is it grossly misaligned? Make up your mind. Katz also later discusses, in depth, the fact that James Marsters approached the character of Spike using method acting. He needed to get into the mind of something evil, and so he chose the closest real-world example he could find: predatory men at bars. This is a very real thing. Does Evan Ross Katz think it's not? Or, does he think vampires are real and Marsters should have pulled from them??? Evan Ross Katz appears to be trying to suggest that James Marsters is a bad person because he was trying to do his job and portray a character who is a bad man... and this is the only example he could come up with. Go ahead and watch the interview being referenced. We don't hear the question James Marsters was even asked. How leading was it? And how does it have a single thing to do with James Marsters as a person? This says way more to me about Evan Ross Katz than it does about James Marsters.5) Evan Ross Katz is a terrible interviewer, and doesn't know the first thing about pulling quotes. He'll transcribe paragraphs and paragraphs of quotes, completely unpolished, every ""uh"" and ""ah"" intact. What a dick.6) In addition to interviewing cast and crew, he interviewed a few random people who have no business being quoted so extensively in the book. What the fuck do I care what Claire Saffitz has to say about Buffy the Vampire Slayer? I barely even trust what she has to say about cookies, and baking is her literal job. He also interviews Kristin Russo who doesn't even like the show. Has Evan Ross Katz even listened to her podcast? She is objectively not an authority on the show at all. Why were there 10+ pages of sound bytes from her? 7) There's an entire chapter about Buffy's wardrobe, and an entire chapter about how much Evan Ross Katz loves Sarah Michelle Gellar... where of course he had to quote every single compliment she has ever paid him. Gag me.8) The final chapter hints at some interpersonal issues on set. As some folks may know: Nicholas Brendan has had some personal issues, there are rumors that Alyson Hannigan and Sarah Michelle Gellar never got along, David Boreanez wants nothing to do with the show anymore... but Katz just briefly mentions this and moves on. $10 Sarah Michelle Gellar asked him to dance around these actual interesting behind-the-scene bits. Or the fact that he just briefly mentions that there was an on-set rule that Michelle Trachtenberg wasn't allowed to be left in a room with Joss Whedon alone? He just mentions that and changes the subject? What the what???9) Eliza Dushku, David Boreanez, Alyson Hannigan, and Michelle Trachtenberg all declined to talk to him. He blames it on the Joss Whedon issues that have bubbled up over the past year or so. I think they just knew he's a terrible writer and a terrible person and thus made the absolutely correct decision to not talk to this guy.All this to say: Into Every Generation... was an easy paycheck for Evan Ross Katz to chat with Sarah Michelle Gellar and summarize a show he likes. Really, truly, don't waste your time. Watch some older interviews with cast members, and certainly watch the show, but this book will make you dumber if you try to read it....more",Notes are private!,2,32,1,"May 15, 2022","May 28, 2022","May 15, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58313981-into-every-generation-a-slayer-is-born

How'd they manage that??), and THEN saw how rabidly divided folks are on Goodreads. I had no choice. I had to read it for myself.--Well, I guess I'm an outlier. I neither loved it nor hated it. This was a perfectly ""meh"" book. Sarah Perry attempted to do SO MUCH with her narrative and so universally fell short. I don't mean that to sound cruel, but, well, here we are.It's tough to put my finger on what exactly The Essex Serpent is about, because I'm not sure it knows its primary story line. When the book opens, we meet a London surgeon who is traveling to the funeral of one of his patients. So... is he the main character? He is excited to see the widow, because he's in love with her. Why? We don't know. The motivations of every character is unclear, so we better get used to it.When the surgeon gets to the funeral, the narrative starts to focus on the widow (who I'm going to call Claire Danes going forward, because she's partially to blame for my reading this book). So... is Claire Danes the main character?Claire Danes, her sociopathic son, and her platonic companion (except when it's totally not platonic) flee London for the seaside. At this point, we are accosted by characters. A rich couple who find Claire Danes an oddity worth studying, a quirky hovel man who talks to his goats more than people, a gaggle of children, a rich man who is in love with Danes' companion, a stabbing survivor who is ALSO in love with Danes' companion, the surgeon's BFF... like... do we need all these characters?!?! No. We could have halved these characters and still achieved the same narration. But instead we have to juggle all these barely fleshed out folks and their various motivations and flaws. Lastly, we meet Tom Hiddleston (this is also his fault). Tom Hiddleston is a parishioner who lives in a sleepy little village with his frail wife and their 3 children. Hiddleston's village is beginning to quake, because a few unfortunate incidents have inspired the town to blame The Essex Serpent, a mythical creature of local legend. So legendary is this Serpent, that it has been carved into one of the pews of Hiddleston's very church.What follows is a muddled mess of plot. Is the Serpent real, or are the locals just itching for a witch hunt? Will Danes' companion choose a man? It's a weird situation to place the companion in, because her chief motivation seems to be the workers' rights movement of late 19th century London, but that chief motivation drains away as LOVE is introduced into the equation. Which, like, gross. Speaking of gross, Hiddleston and Danes begin to grow attracted to one another, but Hiddleston is married. I can get behind this kind of conflict; love and attraction and marriage are complicated. But Hiddleston's wife is ILL. Like, SUPER ILL, and he's plumb ignoring it. So, he becomes a wholly repugnant character, for seemingly no reason (because motivation, etc. is unclear). And... IS HE THE MAIN CHARACTER??!?! WHO KNOWS!Here's what I'll say: some of the writing is beautiful; Perry knows her prose. But without a clear plot, even that falls flat. Why are the characters doing any of these things? Who are they? What brought them here? The book is 400+ pages and I don't have the answers to these questions. Also, this book needs WAY more Serpent.

I am annoyed with Gornichec because I think this book could have been so much more : it could have been an approachable introduction into underrepresented creation myths, and/or a story about a strong woman, and/or a story about purposeful destruction in the desperate hope for a better future.

It's not particularly cohesive, but the meandering nature sort of matches the meandering of Steinem's life. The beginning was strong. Steinem spoke to her upbringing, the wanderlust of her father, and how she unwittingly followed in his footsteps. As the book progressed, it began to get more repetitive and long-winded. The middle sections about political candidates with whom Steinem has worked with/campaigned for got sort of exhausting. Yes, Steinem, I know I'm supposed to vote and get involved. Her messaging, though important, felt misplaced in this book. The people who would benefit from her instruction would never pick this book up in the first place.It honestly felt like she started out thinking this was going to be a memoir, but, as she was writing, she realized she wanted to tell a larger story about fighting for rights and getting involved in community and politics. When she wrote about the former the book felt put-together; it had life. As she attempted to tackle the latter she sort of lost the thread, and the book became dull.Steinem is an impressively accomplished and inspiring woman, but we might be better served listening to past interviews and speeches rather than reading this book.

The rabbit hole turned into a series of tunnels that culminated in Let's Get Physical the story of how white, 20th century, American women found and embraced exercise. I've seen some squabbling on the internet about how Friedman's book is only that: white, 20th century American women. Personally, I do not have much of an issue with her chosen scope. Exercise was, and in many ways still is, a hobby steeped in privilege. Because of this, a book on the subject will inherently skew white. And Friedman is upfront about this as she writes. She circles back again and again to how exclusive exercise can be: from bespoke studios to expensive workout wear to the female image these trends advertise... it's all a reflection of a very narrow version of Woman. Her final chapter of the book speaks to how exercise culture as a whole is contemporarily attempting to change its image to be more inclusive of race, ethnicity, size, and socioeconomic status. But it's very new, and that's why the women we see in prior chapters look so similar. Let's Get Physical primarily focuses on Pilates, Barre, running, Jazzercise, the exercise video craze of the 80s and 90s (Buns of Steel, Jane Fonda workouts), and yoga. I would have loved more on the running chapter, because it's the exercise I enjoy most in the bunch, and because it's such a fascinating and upsetting history (a woman was ATTACKED by one of the DIRECTORS of the Boston Marathon when he saw she was running the race. And then Friedman inserts a footnote that they ultimately became friends?! What?! Google ""Katherine Switzer"" ""Boston Marathon"" and tell me you don't need 50 pages on how in the heck Friedman could say these two became anything one could label ""friend""). I also would have loved more of a breakdown of casual competitions such as triathlon. But that would have opened many other cans of worms and I understand that would have required so much more research. Guess we'll need a volume 2 ;)For folks who find enjoyment in moving their bodies: read this book.

After a fewAn incredibly depressing reflection on love and its different forms.When I started this book I was put off by its rambling, passive voice. After a few pages, I understood Winman's choice. This book is an internal meditation; the narration should look like someone's inner dialogue, with alternating legato and staccato thoughts and scenes. Tin Man tells the story of two men: Ellis and Michael. The first half of the book follows Ellis, older and alone, though we're not quite sure why he's so solitary... at first. Later, he finds the notebook of his once something-more-than-a friend Michael. The second half is us reading Michael's diary along with Ellis.Winman manages to capture several types of love in this book. First, we see the love between Ellis and his mother, and between his mother and Michael. That innocent, supportive, love-with-abandon that a good mother can provide to any child who is lucky enough to find themselves under her wing. This shifts to the different types of love Ellis and Michael have for one another. Ellis' love for Michael is complicated, straddling friendship and something more. Michael's love for Ellis is all-encompassing. He will take whatever Ellis will give him. As adults, Ellis meets Annie. Again, Winman deftly captures how each feels about the other, because Michael is as much a part of their marriage, even if he doesn't have a ring as physical proof. Winman also captures love-as-loss, love-as-fear. It's incredible that she packed so much in such a slim novel.If you don't want to cry, don't read this book. But if you've got the stomach for something heartbreaking, you really can't do better than Winman's Tin Man....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,Oct 2022,"Oct 10, 2022","Mar 14, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36676536-tin-man

I just remembered my Oma reading it when it first came out and talking about the crazy nightmares she had while reading it. Crazy nightmares? Count me in.Duma Key is the story of Edgar Freemantle (feels like a fake name). Edgar is a pretty wealthy construction guy who gets super smashed at a job site. After being apparently straight up ABUSIVE to his wife after the accident, the marriage falls apart. So, since he's got the cash, he takes the advice of his doctor and runs away from the pieces of his cold Minnesota life for the warm bath that is the Florida Keys. The fictional Duma Key where he makes his temporary home is relatively abandoned. Why? Because people don't want to go to this sleepy island when they could party somewhere else? Because it's hAuNtEd?!?!??! Anywho, he picks up drawing, because he was a doodler in his past life, right? So why not start drawing as a way to pass the time. But his drawing sessions are black-out-possessions and what he creates in his Art Fugues are brilliant... but in a horrifying way. And... wait... are the paintings some sort of clairvoyance? Are they alive? hAuNtEd?!?!??!You'd think most of the narrative would follow Edgar as he tried to unpack his spooky gift and its implications. Well. You'd be wrong. Most of the narrative is about Edgar eating and how he loves his younger daughter WAY MORE than his older daughter for no apparent reason and how his ex-wife is a bitch and how much his body hurts after getting smashy smashed.

And, to be fair, Aminatou Sow and Ann Friedman do try to deliver on this front at least a little. They spoke to sociologists/psychologists/historians and pepper anecdotes throughout the book. That's all they are, though: anecdotes. And those anecdotes are smushed between large retrospectives as the two authors pen mini-memoirs, and then slapdash connect one another to their memories. It's a clumsy read, especially because the narrative kept switching from ""we/us"" to ""Aminatou/Ann.""

By definition it's going to fall into the category of Navel Gazing. But I couldn't help but be put off by Sow and Friedman by the end. The frequency with which they'd be like ""oh, then we and our 26 closest friends went on a retreat together,"" or ""so we gathered 10 friends and we..."" or ""everyone has 50 people they can call when shit hits the fan"" just felt so out of touch.

Dickens comes back to this again and again in the staggering Society and the laws that guide it are rotten mess of entitlement, greed, and stupidity. Dickens comes back to this again and again in the staggering 991 page Bleak House. Sometimes I felt he went a little long on domestic vignettes that lent nothing to characterization and plot, and sometimes the characters felt more like anthropomorphized concepts than actual people who could actually exist. Nevertheless, Bleak House is a scathing opus on classism, the legal system, and modern civilization itself. And now, for a dramatic synopsis of Bleak House:Esther is a timid, bound-by-duty young girl who is raised by her aunt. Her aunt hates her. Why? Hold that thought. Some random dude pays for Esther to get away from her aunt so bye bye bitch and HELLO two rich cousins (cousins to each other, not to Esther) who seem like maybe they want to bone?

But, wait, we're changing perspectives. Let's pan to the mean London streets to meet little homeless Jo who no one cares about because he's got too much dirt on him. Get going, Jo. You're not wanted here. Sure you're small and pathetic and hungry and cold but the Inspector told you to get gone so SCOOT. Anyway, look at these rich people. Aren't they beautiful? But wait... what are these secrets and betrayal and murder lurking underneath? HOLD FOR A SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION. Esther's narrative is back and getting knotted up with both rich and poor perspectives. She tries to help one while not getting pulled down by the other. Which is which?

Is one of them barfing blood because he's so obsessed with an inheritance he can't quite reach? And, wait, Esther, did you just get SMALLPOX?? Smallbox will make you an uggo, you know. But, whoa, are you going to use your uggo-ness to manipulate a bunch of bastards to do what you want? GET IT, GIRL.

Let's break it down.Grady Hendrix's book is based on the question: ""what if the female survivors from several of the most popular horror/slasher flicks live in the same reality together, and have collectively started a support group to manage the trauma of living beyond the horrors in their movies? Also, what if all of their horrors were turned into movies in this reality too?"" Our narrator is Lynnette, a middle aged (all of the women are middle aged because the book takes place in 2010 and the horrors of each character took place approximately when their inspo movies were released in the 70s/80s/90s) woman who survived a Christmas-themed murder spree (aka the movie Silent Night, Deadly Night). The book slowly introduces each of the other women in the support group: Adrienne (Friday the 13th), Dani (Halloween), Julia (Scream), Marilyn (Texas Chainsaw Massacre), and Heather (Nightmare on Elm Street). They also briefly mention someone named Chrissy who ""betrayed"" the group and whose trauma, in this reality, was adapted into movies called Gnomecoming. Unlike all the other women, I'm not sure which real-life movie Gnomecoming is based on. Leprechaun? I googled it and the masses aren't in agreement. There are a lot of ideas: a combination of Prom and Trolls 2, perhaps? Who knows. Moving on. The women are all very different from one another, especially with how they've managed their trauma: a paranoid, an addict, an advocate, an armor-yourself-with-millions-of-dollars type, a contemplative introvert, and an insists-on-being-normal type. When we meet them they started this group 15+ years ago, and some of them are itching to move on from the events that seek to define them. But then, like any good horror movie, the bad guys seem to rise from the dead...It's an easy/campy read that was great for a plane ride. Grady Hendrix makes a few weak attempts to comment on slasher movies, our obsession with them, and what that obsession says about how we value life; particularly the lives of women. But those attempts fall quite short, especially when they're coming out of the mouths of deranged characters. If anything, these attempts felt more like the rantings at the end of particularly meta slash movies, just not as good. That is, this book points to our obsession with violence and fame and then blazes on through anyway, completely ignoring any contradictions in its wake. If you're a horror/slasher buff, this book is definitely fun, but you aren't going to bend any brain cells getting through it.Also, I just need to say I am very confused by his inclusion of Nightmare on Elm Street. There are so many slasher movies out there but Nightmare on Elm Street, at least to me, is pure horror. And to introduce something so blatantly supernatural and hardly do anything with that was weird and disappointing. If there's gonna be magic in this world, give us magic. Don't talk about ""The Night King"" and barely even give us a taste! You could have chosen Saw or The Strangers, Hostel... I could go on. Hell, he could have even tapped into the grand universe of Stephen King. Carrie, Cujo, or Christine would all have been far more believable supernatural occurrences than Freddy Krueger. What if he had used The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon??? That would have been amazing. But I guess that's a book not a movie. Sigh. I wonder if he chose Krueger because he was picturing a television series based on this book (that's happening, you know)? Both of Hendrix's books have read to me like he was thinking about seeing his work on the screen as he was writing. But we're on a tangent now, and we have things to do. Read this book, or don't. Live you life. Ok bye. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,Aug 2022,"Aug 05, 2022","Mar 09, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55829194-the-final-girl-support-group

Too bad, because McDougall's book jumps from topic-to-topic with frustrating frequency. Wait! Don't go! That might sound annoying (and sometimes it was), but McDougall holds it together. It's like a friend telling a long story over a beer. Sometimes they get side-tracked by context/backstory, but the tale always comes around. The main through line in this narrative is a man known as Caballo Blanco. You see, the impetus of Born to Run came when McDougall was nursing a string of running injuries. He refused to quit the sport, despite doctor recommendations, so he went looking for something revolutionary. That's when he heard about the Tarahumara and their culture of running. Caballo Blanco promised to be the key to getting an introduction to any Tarahumara and the secrets they may have.Along this journey we learn about McDougall's relationship with running, about popular theories on why people run, about evolution, about several ultra-races and the athletes who compete in them, and receive a overview of the Tarahumara themselves. It's all interesting, but you'll be deep into a nail-biting race and then McDougall breaks in the middle with a random chapter on sneakers. DUDE. WHY. But that just goes to show what an engaging story McDougall weaves: I was so invested in that race story I didn't want to be torn away.Back to those sneakers... that's where we get to the dubious science of this book. Though it really only comprises 2 chapters, McDougall does veer into some weird-and-sometimes-contradictory territory on what runners should and should not be doing. He seems to be really into the barefoot running movement, and subscribes to the hypothesis that humans evolved to be able to rundown / exhaust their prey in order to obtain meat. He then also tells us we should all be vegetarians (which, as a vegetarian + some fish my husband catches person myself, didn't offend me at all. It just gave me a bit of whiplash to be told ""we run for meat because meat is life"" and then ""but if you want to be a runner don't eat it""). He also essentially suggests that running can cure every disease ever. It can't, but as someone who also loves running, I assume that wild assertion was written shortly after a run when his brain was shorting out on endorphins (wait, I just Googled it. Make that endocannabinoids).McDougall also got a BIT sexist about poor Ann Trason, because she was allegedly a little rude to the Tarahumara at Leadsville '94. Listen, Trason had been hearing misogynistic bullshit about the Tarahumara for weeks. Was it all fabricated by the odious, fame-seeking Rick Fisher? Yes. But she didn't know that! So she quipped at them ""how does it feel to compete with a woman?"" Big whoop. Let's leave the snide comments aside, eh? You have no idea what it's like to be a female athlete, McDougall. I beg you to sit down.Okay, last complaint and we'll move on. In my opinion, the biggest whoops McDougall makes is talking about how running injuries have skyrocketed in recent years. He tries to suggest that new, fancy running sneakers are to blame. What proof does he have? None, save for the barefoot running preference he has. He completely ignores what seems to me to be the biggest factor: this book was written from 2006 - 2009. Running was exploding in popularity at that time. Could it be that folks were getting injured more often because there were just so many more runners lacing up and heading out for the first time? I started college in 2006 and graduated in 2010. In 2006, very few people were out there running around campus with me. By 2010, I was whipping around runners hitting the pavement with insane strides that surely ended up injuring them. That's the problem, isn't it? People going for runs without paying attention to their stride, their feet, their backs, their breath. But McDougall doesn't even consider that. He's just like ""stupid sneakers go run in nothing lol."" face palmI lied. One last thing: he says regular yoga practice increases injury. No study cited. I'm calling total bullshit on this. Yoga has objectively helped me. Training/recovery needs are individualistic, and this is dangerous. These are missteps, sure, but they appear to me to stem mainly from ignorance, so I forgive him. And I need to forgive him, because, at the end of the day, I really enjoyed this book. Look past these 2 wildly inaccurate chapters and its core message is incredible. It's a message McDougall lost sight of when he started jibbering on about barefoot running and cancer cures, but I took it to heart: running is about fun. It's about finding joy in moving your body, and being curious in your limits and abilities. Feel the sun on your face, the breeze in your hair. Embrace challenge. Running, above all else, should just be about your connection with your body and your mind. That looks different for everyone, which is why folks not only fall in love with different types of running, but also prefer different types of gear/sneakers/weather/elevation/etc. on their runs. And I really, really love that. I also really love many of the people McDougall introduces us to: Scott Jurek, Arnulfo Quimare, Manuel Luna, Caballo Blanco... they all sound like good-hearted people who became connected by a passion that is often enjoyed alone. I do think McDougall takes it a smidge too far when he suggests that being a runner inherently makes you a good person (look at the front few rows of people at any race and tell me they wouldn't punch you in the face if it meant crossing the finish line before you), but I get what he's trying to say: that the people he met on the journey to write this book brim with love and kindness. They deserve to be celebrated. The end of the book brought tears to my eyes, because I wanted to give everyone a big, sweaty, post-run hug. I don't think you have to be a runner to really enjoy this book. This book is more about human experience than anything else. But I would urge folks to take the science-y portions with a grain of salt.

My complaints were chiefly 1) plot holes and 2) portrayal of women. The translation, however, was beautiful. I enjoyed the lyricism of the book, even if I did not particularly enjoy the subject matter. So when I saw that Murakami wrote a memoir, and one about running (as avid runner myself), it seemed like a slam dunk. He wouldn't really be describing women (sure enough, his wife appears ~twice in the whole thing), and it's his life, so plot holes were kind of a non-issue.I'm not sure if Murakami writes nonfiction in a drastically different fashion than fiction, or if translator Philip Gabriel isn't particularly good at his job, but this book was not well-written. It's very much ""this happened, then this happened,"" type writing, like a child writing their ""What I Did This Summer"" essay for their teacher.Despite that wicked burn, I want to be clear: I enjoyed this book, and I think fellow runners/triathletes would enjoy it too. I initially picked up running to acquire that void Murakami mentions, and that void continues to soothe me. Reading about someone's world melting away as the miles tick by was comforting, and reading someone's bewilderment their first time swimming in a triathlon was hilarious. I also loved this passage:Most of what I know about writing I've learned through running every day. These are practical, physical lessons. How much can I push myself. How much rest is appropriate - and how much is too much? How far can I take something and still keep it decent and consistent? When does it become narrow-minded and inflexible? How much should I be aware of the world outside, and how much should I focus on my inner world? To what extent should I be confident in my abilities, and when should I start doubting myself? Being 33 years old myself, I didn't love this passage:That's how I started running. Thirty-three - that's how old I was then. Still young enough, though no longer a *young man.* The age that Jesus Christ died. The age that Scott Fitzgerald started to go downhill. That age may be a kind of crossroads in life.No thank you, sir.

This book was not as advertised.Sprinkled throughout were very tiny ""chapters"" (like, ~2 pages a pop) discussing the lives of trees. Those were interesting, but they were too few and far between and they were also quite odd. Jahren is trying to make us, the layman reader, feel guilty for the fate of the planet. It's not us - it's the massive corporations, the heads of which are not picking up your book so lay off, will you? In addition, these tiny ""chapters"" talk about the propagation of trees like every single seed that a tree sends out into the world is trying so hard to become a tree, and so few succeed. I'm all for anthropomorphizing, but, like, does Jahren view every single sperm as a thinking organism trying so hard to become a baby?

Applegate not only researched Polly Adler, but also the Russian village where Adler was born, New York City the place in the 1920s and 30s, the politics of Adler's world, and the biographies of many key public figures of the time, including mobsters, policemen, and musicians. I can see Applegate sitting down to write, then thinking ""wait, who is the police commissioner, like, really?"" Then going down a 2-day rabbit hole reading everything she can about the man, circling back to write, and having to rinse and repeat dozens and dozens of times as Adler's world unfurled before her.Writing nonfiction is so difficult. You want to paint an accurate picture, but you also have to trim the fat and fill in blanks in order to create a compelling narrative, and that's where Applegate fell short for me. I think she got so bogged down in researching everything that was going on around Polly Adler, she was so preoccupied with the framework of Polly Adler, that she sort of lost sight of Polly Adler the person. Who, you know, was the whole point of the book, or so it was billed. Part of the issue seems to be all of the secrecy and rumor surrounding Polly Adler. Adler published a memoir, sure, but can you really believe said memoir? And, if so little is definitively out there about Ms. Adler, isn't it better to just write what we know is truth?I'm gonna say no.Sorry. I think about Robert Massie's book on Catherine the Great. He took leaps and made assumptions in that book to make it a truly fantastic biography. For whatever reason, Applegate was unwilling to make leaps, or draw conclusions, and her book suffers from that reluctance. You could easily say ""sources disagree, but"" and give us the goods. At the end of 500 pages, I don't feel as though I know who Polly Adler was. What I do have is a rich description of what New York City was like in the 1920s and 30s. Applegate also spent a lot of time fleshing out organized crime. To a certain extent, it makes sense. Ms. Adler was dealing in an illegal business, so organized crime was going to be a factor in her life. But Applegate spent too much time talking about how this mobster hated that mobster and those mobsters tried to gun down these mobsters and just, like, who cares? There were so many names flying around who had very little to do with Polly Adler. And, again, isn't this a book about Polly Adler?I'm going to do what Applegate didn't, and draw a conclusion here. I think Applegate did so much research to ensure accuracy of time and place that she lost sight of her subject matter. She had so much detail about all these people and events from her research, that she decided to include them all, despite their only tangential relation to the point of the book she was writing. I get it: you did all that work and want to ""show"" that work, as it were. But the book dragged in places because of this exhaustive inclusion that rarely circled back to Polly Adler the person.This became frustrating as the book marched on, because we were spending so much time with male mobsters, but Applegate never really unpacked what I was interested in: being a woman in the 1920s dealing in prostitution where women are abused and murdered regularly. There are several scenes in Madam where Polly Adler and/or the women she employs are abused by customers, but Applegate takes the anthropological approach with these scenes. She doesn't comment on or unpack these injustices. She records them and moves on. We spend so much time learning about the powerful men in the book, and so little time learning about the women beneath, or sometimes on top, of them. Would providing that context and commentary be an impossible ask for an author? These women were, in most cases, intentionally anonymous. But we could explore what it was like to be Woman back then, and we could, again, draw conclusions to try to breathe color and life into these women who deserve to, finally, have voices. It was disappointing to get so much detail about the peripheral men in Polly Adler's life, but so little about the women surrounding her. To be fair, the final page of the book is a thunderclap of genius, speaking to what few avenues of power women had during Polly Adler's time. But that is ONE page in a 500 book, and it just demonstrates that Applegate has the writing chops to really break down Polly Adler for us, and didn't. TL;DR : meticulously researched and generally well-written but it isn't about Polly Adler so much as as snapshot of New York City in the 1920s and 30s....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Feb 18, 2022","Mar 12, 2022","Jan 27, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57004604-madam

Because it's not ""we;"" it's the giant corporations raping the world for their profits. I'm sick and tired of people telling me that I personally need to do more. I compost. I grow my own food and get my produce from a local CSA half the year while shopping in season and eating frozen produce the other half. I have an all-electric + wood burning stove house. I don't drive often, and fly once, MAYBE twice a year. I recycle, and make most of my food from scratch ... what I'm trying to say is WELCOME TO THE OLIGARCHY EAT THE RICH. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jan 24, 2022","Feb 11, 2022","Jan 24, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17465709-braiding-sweetgrass

This book was so thoughtfully constructed, and it shows. Because it's perfect.Broad strokes: Our narrator is Patroclus: a neglected, sickly little prince boy, who was given to the father of Achilles for raising. Patroclus and Achilles grow close, and grow up and go to the Trojan War together.That's... that's all I'm going to say. It's weird to consider spoilers for a retelling of a Greek myth, but I had never heard the name Patroclus before opening these pages.

We see her humble beginnings to arrival to Hollywood to meteoric rise to decision to step away from the spotlight.The book does a few things very well. The sexism of the film industry? Author Taylor Jenkins Reid is ON it. Evelyn Hugo grapples with that teeter-totter of using the leverage her beauty affords, without losing herself in the myth that her beauty is all that she is. That internal power struggle, and the seedy people external to Hugo who perpetuate it, were very well done. It was more depth than I ever would have expected from a fluff novel.On that depth note: Hugo's relationships are heartbreaking and, for the most part, well-written. Each of the 7 have their own unique expectations and shortcomings, baldly described, though they did become more unbelievable as the book went on. Husband #7 would just never happen, so, that was kind of annoying. I wasn't a huge fan of the narration style. Evelyn Hugo is orally retelling the story of her life to a journalist, so the sections about her life are first person. This felt like a poor choice, because no way are you going to remember the back and forth of conversations the way they're told in the pages of this book. Also, the dialogue was... not very believable (just like those latter husbands, eh? Guess there's a lot of brain suspending in this one, folks). But, whatever. Hollywood, right?Speaking of that journalist, we don't get very much at all about her as a person. So the idea that I'm supposed to care about her toward the end was a shock. Guess what? I don't. Because you didn't either, dear author. You, like most of the characters in your book, were too busy staring at Evelyn Hugo. Those complaints aside, I found this book to be a lot of fun.

Ticked off at the government, ticked off at our educational systems, ticked off at our children, and ticked off at the uncurious-yet-superstitious minds of his contemporaries. So he sat down and published this series of essays (some of which he'd previously published in journals/magazines; some of which he had been workshopping with his Cornell students).I came to this book because of his chapter on witchcraft. I stayed for the sass.I transcribed some favorite passages at the bottom of this , but here's a round-up of my thoughts before we let Sagan speak for himself:1. This book should actually be called ""Aliens don't care about Earth, your butt, or your crops. Also, science and education are good."" Why? Because the first HALF of this book is pretty laser-focused on alien abduction and crop circles. I guess this was more popular in the mid-90s than it is in the 2020s (remember the pilot of South Park?), but, even if that's true, it was a little much to harp on alien interaction with humans so much. We get it, man, move on.2. I really, really enjoyed that passages that broke out religion vs. science, and why we should always trust science. He admonishes us for not searching for logical answers, for not using scientific method to address our questions about the universe. A bearded man in the sky, you say?! PROVE IT. I laughed out loud a few times.3. Sagan spends a bit of the book talking about the American education system. I agreed with some of what he had to say, specifically, that we should be compensating and supporting our educators in such a way that they are allotted the funds and creative license to ensure their topics are interesting to their student body. It was a fantastic look at what our government values (military) and what it doesn't (education). That said, Sagan then goes on a tirade about how American children are given too much free time and should be in school 250+ days out of the year and how they're lazy and that, my buds, rubbed me the wrong way. Free play is important too. Creative, ""open"" time for the mind to just do its thing is equally valuable. Geez louise. So, while there were some fantastic nuggets of in this section, it got bogged down in the weird ""ALWAYS BE IN THE CLASSROOM, YOU STUPID BABIES"" rhetoric.4. His unpacking of how America treats women and POC was ahead of its time. Bravo.All this to say: the parts that were great were so great I interrupted my husband from whatever he was doing to read them out loud. But there were some lengthy, clunky sections (re: Aliens and CHAIN CHILDREN TO THEIR SCHOOL DESKS) that really dragged down the central themes of the book. And what was that central theme? Be curious. Ask questions. Don't assume that what you've always known to be true is infallible. Learn. Communicate. Be a member of this society. And wow does that slap in the face of all we've been through since 2016. And now, for the book to speak for itself:I have a foreboding of an America in my children's or grandchildren's time - when the United States is a service and information economy... when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can ever grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgably question those in authority; when... our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what's true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The American system of jurisprudence recognizes a wide range of factors, predispositions, prejudices, and experiences that might cloud our judgment, or affect our objectivity - sometimes even without our knowing it. It goes to great, perhaps even extravagant, lengths to safeguard the process of judgment in a criminal trial from the human weaknesses of those who must decide on innocence or guilt. Even then, of course, the process sometimes fails. Why would we settle for anything less when interrogating the natural world, or when attempting to decide on vital matters of politics, economics, religion, and ethics?In our time, with total fabrication of realistic stills, motion pictures, and videotapes technologically within reach, with television in every home, and with critical thinking in decline, restructuring societal memories even without much attention from the secret police seems possible. What I'm imagining here is not that each of us has a budget of memories implanted in special therapeutic sessions by state-appointed psychiatrists, but rather that small numbers of people will have so much control over news stories, history books, and deeply affecting images as to work major changes in collective attitudes.Yes, Alden Capital, Facebook, and the Kochs, Carl Sagan saw you.

They're kicking rocks, all pissed off, and after 2 whole books of that, I wanted more characterization. I think N.K. Jemisin was done with this shit and wanted to move on, and so did her characters, apparently. We were given another narrative in this third and final installment. However, unlike the unique lenses that were introduced in The Obelisk Gate, this new perspective did not provide much insight into anything at all. It gave us an answer to a big ""how,"" but that answer could have been an email.I praised books 1 & 2 for their stark, no-nonsense narration. Jemisin isn't a flowery writer, so she's not going to fake it. I dug that. She isn't flowery in book #3, either, but she is trying to unpack the methodology behind all the magic-y, sci-fi-y stuff in her world and it. Is. Clunky. And boring! And, because she isn't a descriptive writer, it actually brings up more questions than it answers.Despite these complaints, The Stone Sky was still a solid conclusion to an otherwise pretty great trilogy. And, again, she did end the book strongly. We need books like this, that provide no-bullshit commentary on human selfishness and greed and, I mean, look around you. It's what we're living.

It was, indeed, a great running companion.I knew many Greek myths vaguely; Stephen Fry takes a couple dozen of these stories and tells them in a way that is fluid. We have recurring characters who fight and love and live together. Origin stories such as why the bee has a stinger or why we call spiders arachnids, how the Trojan war began with a golden apple, just how badass I always knew Artemis was... I feel as though this book gave me a wealth of cultural knowledge.It's important to note that Fry takes liberties in his book - he even addresses as much at the close. But, as he states, these are oral stories that have been passed down for a millennia; they've changed a bit with each retelling. I prefer that he pick his preferred interpretation than bog us down with ""some say this, others say that, others still say this other thing."" He does skirt into that from time to time, but mostly when we're talking about etymology, and I'm down for nerding out about words. It gets a little silly at times, but thus is Stephen Fry. He's keeping the whimsy even while torture one another.Any interest in learning more about Greek gods, but in a light, funny way?

It's the second installment of a trilogy, you know? Most books that fall into that category are sort of... well... filler. The author is trying to bridge the gap between the set up of the first book and the climax of the third book, and so #2 falls a little flat. N.K. Jemisin deftly stepped around this issue because:1. The fractured timeline in the first book left plenty to unpack in installment #2.2. She added two new voices to steer different chapters, fleshing out the world and introducing fresh characters, personalities, and conflicts.Unlike book #1, book #2 is far more laser-focused. Jemisin is getting to the meat of Seasons, what this world once was, and what it could be in the future. She also gets into the weeds on what orogeny is.

And maybe Nietzsche didn't deserve that. Nietzsche was a fascinating man who was brave enough to think critically about the people and the societal structures around him. For that reason, I think he should be read and understood. His nuggets on religion electrified me. The concept that what is ""moral,"" ""good,"" or ""right"" has been defined by the elite and is not reflective of the populous? Genius. His urging that man seek his pleasure and purpose is something we still haven't fully realized.But, on the other hand, maybe Nietzsche did deserve my reluctant limping. Because therein lies the problem: his urging that MAN seek HIS pleasure. Nietzsche can be as sexist little shit. And yeah, ok, a victim of his time or whatever, but I found myself rolling my eyes at him sometimes, and it made working through his works somewhat arduous. Take this from Beyond Good and Evil:Woman has much reason for shame; so much pedantry, superficiality, schoolmarmishness, petty presumption, petty licentiousness and immodesty lies concealed in woman-one only needs to study her behavior with children!-and so far all this was at bottom best repressed and kept under control by fear of man. Woe when ""the eternally boring in woman"" -she is rich in that!- is permitted to venture forth!JFC, Nietzsche. What were you, the OG incel? Despite this, there are some great quotes. A couple of favorites:Nothing has been exercised and cultivated better and longer among men so far than obedience.""I have done that,"" says my memory. ""I cannot have done that,"" says my pride, and remains inexorable. Eventually-memory yields.Christianity has been the most calamitous kind of arrogance yet.The Christian resolve to find the world ugly and bad has made the world ugly and bad.  PS.

Really?Barbarian Days is an entertaining memoir about William Finnegan, a white man who was born in 1952. The book starts out when he is in 8th grade, and he and his family has moved from California to Hawaii. He doesn't fit in, save for in the water. And that's that. We follow him from 1966 through 2014, as he chases those waves that feel like home. Barbarian Days is, above all else, a book about surfing... and that's kind of what bothered me? That sounds insane, I know. It's right there in the byline: ""A Surfing Life."" But it's how Finnegan presented the rest of his world around his surfing obsession that really grinds my gears.William Finnegan traveled the entire world on a shoestring budget looking for the perfect wave. This is a thing only a privileged Boomer White Man could do... and Finnegan doesn't acknowledge this or unpack this once in 447 pages. He tells ""funny"" anecdotes about how he shows up on doorsteps in far flung places, where the people give him and his surfing buddy Bryan food and shelter in exchange for... nothing? He mentions giving someone a glass plate once? I don't know, man, but they are full-on taking advantage of these people and their hospitality and Finnegan doesn't acknowledge that. He's just like ""and then we slept in our nice, Western manufactured mosquito nets after we ate all their food LOL."" Yikes.He regales us with this time they canoed out to a remote island but he and Bryan couldn't fish for shit, so the locals who canoed them out there fish for them. Like, bitch, why are you even out here?!?! Stop making these people take care of you!! What is this, a trip for babies?!?!?Ahem.One of the excerpts I hated the most went as follows:Gene was pushing sixty. His girlfriend was a knockout but not happy. I overheard her telling the wife of a Parker executive that she was a half-Fijian orphan, and therefore a social outcast in the homogenous Tong. She had turned to prostitution, she said. She was now desperate to get away from Gene. ""Help me! Help me!"" she pleaded.The executive's wife looked stricken. I couldn't hear what she said to the girl, but I was standing there when she approached Gene. She timidly tried to make conversation, mentioning that she had heard that his young friend was half-Fijian.Gene snarled, ""I don't care what she told you, honey, she's a n****r."" [my censure]Brad came by that night on his horse. I asked him if the police could be trusted to enforce the law against Parker Oil's employees. He gave me a long, thoughtful look, and then shook his head. ""They're with the king,"" he said. Gene's desperate girlfriend would be the one arrested it charges were laid. And then he changes the subject to Brad and that's the last we hear of this.It's almost as if he's acting as an anthropologist, all ""I can look but I can't get involved."" Like, bitch, what? HELP THIS GIRL. You have SO MUCH power, demonstrated by all the preceding pages where you blatantly took advantage of the kindness of others. God forbid you pay it forward and help a teenage prostitute being raped by a 60 year old white man?!?! Or, at the very least, now that you've had time to reflect, write an extra paragraph about how your lack of action was shameful??? But, no, you just drop the interaction here and wander away. And he does this several times over the course of the book. You know what this tells me? That he hasn't grown or changed from the 20-something selfish asshole he was then. He jokingly recalls how shit he was to women and to his family, and how all he cared about was the surf. He eventually heads back to the states and does just fine, because he's a White Man Boomer, but he also doesn't unpack THAT, even though he published the book in 2015. Because, say it with me now: selfish asshole. Here's what I have to say: William Finnegan can write, and he's got a fantastic memory (it also helps that he and the people around him journaled and kept all the letters they wrote to one another). But he's incapable of real reflection. Even at the end, where he's still surfing even though he's old and he's got a kid and he's near-death-ing it in the water over and over because he's all used up now on the surfboard. Why did you have a kid if you're still going out there smashing your body against rocks?!?! Grow the fuck up!Ugh, I'm so mad, but this book does still get 3 stars.

Unfortunately, a rose-scented turd is still, you know, a turd.To everyone who wants to write a mystery:1. You need to have several characters. Otherwise we all know whodunnit instantly. It's called deduction. Hasn't anyone read Agatha Christie?!?!2. If hints are going to be in the protagonist's own book that he wrote, WHY DOESN'T HE KNOW HIS OWN BOOK?!?!

And stealing has consequences.It's tired, I knew that, but Stephen King blurbed it and that creepy madness king suckered me into snagging a copy. King, you minx, why do you do these things to me? This book was just awful in how basic it was. It's a mystery for someone who has never, ever read a mystery before. AND THE STAKES ARE SO LOW. Actually, this might be why King liked it. Because The Plot also reminds me of Lisey's Story. Was this because there's a magical, alternate reality in The Plot? Ha. No. There's not even much a reality here. Because the protagonist's actions make zero sense. None. Zilch. He wastes a ton of money and time trying to unravel who is harassing him... and to what end? And why? Jean Hanff Korelitz says it herself: you can't own an idea. So... why doesn't the protagonist just come clean to his publisher and move on with his (pretty fabulous) life? We don't know.

There is only the faintest whiff of the supernatural, and, though there is some violence, I'd say it falls in the tame pile in the larger King canon.King's trying something different you see. He's going to tell us a story about a hitman. I liked this book for its plot. Billy Summers takes a job, and there are consequences. It's not aliens or vampires or an apocalypse or a stealer-of-faces that causes the conflict and the action. It's purely the decisions of Billy Summers. That's something quite different for King. Even in books like 11/22/63 the main character is reacting to external forces more often than not. Billy Summers has very much made his own bed.And yet.And yet the book was... just okay? I'm surprised to see those words appear on the screen, actually, because the ending was actually pretty tight, which is a shocker. Stephen King books usually unspool wwaaayyy before the final scenes. This one stayed on message. Probably because there wasn't anything for Owen King to smush an alien into.My problem is motive.There's not a lot of it.We learn a lot about Billy Summers... but we don't actually see under the curtain to his motives. What drives him. What his life is like. He just sort of... there. There's The Before. And then there's The Now. But what happened to get him from Before to Now? I have no idea.The co-star of the book (who I will not name here because minor spoiler and you're welcome) likewise not only has a thin motive... but they abandon their life because of trauma. And that part really bothered me. The trauma and the reactions of the characters to that trauma is upsetting, to put it mildly. I... I can't imagine people reacting the way Summers and this secondary character react. The entire existence of this co-star is troubling. There were better background stories to get them where King wanted them to go, and I have no idea why no one pointed any of those out to King. But, then again, who is giving King notes these days? His books sell.Ok, I'm getting salty. I guess where I fall on this whole thing is: I like King. I like his books. I like that this story didn't fall apart. But when it comes to hitman thrillers, they aren't his wheelhouse, so the story just didn't sweep me away. I prefer my King books monster-y, and prefer my hitman books King-less.(view spoiler)[ Older men and younger women? Just don't do it.

I'm not sure Sally Rooney asked herself this.I have a theory about this book: it's part memoir for Sally Rooney, part excerpts from her diary.This isn't a good thing.Beautiful World, Where Are You follows two friends and the unfolding of their separate lives in their late 20s. Alice wrote a smash hit book when she was younger (ahem), and had a bit of a breakdown underneath the constant scrutiny and expectations that come with wild fame at a young age. She runs from Dublin and what she's used to to a house by the sea to collect herself and return to her work. To reset. There she meets a working-class man named Felix, who is an absolute douche. He treats her like he could take her or leave her, whatever. And Alice, I guess in a reflection of her self-worth, just lets it happen. The Alice/Felix story made me feel icky. Like when you have a friend and their significant other starts to pick on them in front of you. Like, stop doing that! I'm THEIR friend. You're gross! So, that's half the book.The other half follows Eileen, still in Dublin after Alice left, still working a job that pays her nothing in an apartment she hates watching everyone else grow up and move on while she's feeling uncomfortably stagnant. She recently got out of a serious, live-in relationship, and doesn't know where to turn. So she turns to her childhood-friend-and-sometimes-fuck-buddy Simon. Rooney makes Simon religious... and it's not clear why? Simon is your average man in his mid-30s, save for the fact that he goes to church every Sunday and once planned to join the church as he life's cause. But this doesn't actually add texture to the character, so why? I assume it's because Simon is based on someone very specific in her life. I have to say, I liked the Eileen/Simon storyline. What I loved about Normal People was Rooney's ability to flesh out a relationship where both people are afraid to get hurt, so they hide portions of themselves from the other. This leads to unintentional misunderstandings and, whoops irony, hurt. It's so real, and she does it so well. This, and Eileen and Alice's relationship (which we don't get enough of) is why the book gets 3 stars. To transition the reader from Alice chapters to Eileen chapters, the perspectives are broken up with mini-chapters, which are supposed to be emails sent between the two women. These were straight up diary entries of Rooney's that she just slapped into the book. How could they not be? They are rants about climate change, religion, babies, politics, philosophy. They're the debates you hear in a college cafeteria. They were exhausting, and, I'm sorry, not how friends write to each other. They were speeches. They were life view proclamations. It was so cringey at times I had to skim them. Also, none of them were revolutionary. They were the views most people between the ages of 20-35 have on the world. So... why? (so asks the creative writing TA inside me). To fill up a page requirement? We may never know. TL;DR - if you like Rooney, sure, read it. But this book fell very short of the raw desperation of Normal PeopleA friend lent me this book, and had one page dog-eared. The below is from that page, which may be one of the best pages in the whole book (yes, I'm likely biased because I received a signal this was important to someone I love, but ah, well, aren't we all?):I just want everything to be like it was, and for us to be young again and live near each other and nothing to be different.and, later in this same scene:If you weren't my friend I wouldn't know who I was.We need more stories about friendship.(view spoiler)[one more thing: there was that rant about bringing children into this world at the beginning of the book. Then, at the end, Eileen is pregnant and excited about it. Okay, fine, people's minds change, especially in the face of an unplanned pregnancy. But Rooney didn't stop there, she was all: I could not stomach the idea of having an abortion just because I'm afraid of climate change. For me (and maybe only for me) it would be a sort of sick, insane thing to do, a way of mutilating my real life as a gesture of submission to an imagined future. I don't want to belong to a political movement that makes me view my own body with suspicion and terror. No matter what we think or fear about the future of civilisation, women all over the world will go on having babies, and I belong with them, and any child I might have belongs with their children... I feel it, and I know it to be true.""  Say it with me, say it loud, say it proud: fuck you, Sally Rooney!

Their world is being torn apart by some sort of ongoing climate crisis that hits every now again... there could have 1,000 years of peace... and then a fifth season hits that wipes out countless people. It's something that is constantly hanging over the heads of everyone alive. Will this be the year of a Fifth Season? Will they be spared, killed instantly, or forced to roam to try and start anew? Damaya, Syenite, and Essun are just trying to survive. They're trying to live. They're trying......but now we're getting ahead of ourselves, aren't we?This is everything I scream about when reading sci-fi/fantasy. The breaking of gender norms. Strength across the board. Drives that are utterly independent from interpersonal relationships.I.Loved.This.Book. [my one complaint is that Jemisin utilizes the present tense for the bulk of this book... but every now and again she forgets, because it's an unusual choice. It is VERY jarring when there's a rando tense shift. Another (minor) complaint is the simplicity of the narrative. It's not fair, but your girl loves a flowery passage. Jemisin is a utilitarian writer. Not a bad thing, but, again, a bit jarring.]...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Nov 19, 2021",Dec 2021,"Oct 05, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/19161852-the-fifth-season

Arden did not betray main character Vasya in order to fit her into specific tropes. Since Arden already had buy-in from her readers at this point, she also went harder into the broader historical framework of this story: battles and people and events that truly did happen in medieval Russia are peppered in The Winter of the Witch. Arden also really went for the jugular with Christianity which I. Was. HERE. For.Look, how am I supposed to express my feelings toward this trilogy without giving anything away?

We hear from royalty, from deities and goddesses, from slaves, and from the ever-patient wife of Odysseus, Penelope. Calliope is hilarious, Penelope is exasperated, Hecabe stoically breaks apart, Cassandra is silently, miserably, mad.

I finished this book the nightIt's true what they say, that your reception of a particular book is predicated on the environment in which it is read. I finished this book the night of Thursday, September 9. I had spent the past week at a friend's lakehouse. And this book? It's the perfect lakehouse read. You can put it down mid-sentence, which I often did, and jump right back in hours later. It's not well-written, the plot goes down easy... it's perfect fluff. So, after turning the final page (and reading the admittedly powerful afterword) I powered up my phone and gave it a whopping 3 stars.This book so doesn't deserve that. Hence the 2-star rating you see before you. I needed time away from a lake to realize:This book is not good.BUT. This book is a perfect half-listening read... if you're picking up what I'm putting down.Firefly Lane follows two women from 14yrs old through to their mid-4os. These women are about the age of Kristin Hannah herself, and, basking in the nostalgia of her youth, Hannah beats us over the head with cultural references. It really dragged down the book. It's one thing to mention, say, Pogs in passing (a cultural touchstone of my 90s youth). It's a totally different thing to spend paragraphs talking about the clothing and the soft drinks and the music on the radio. Wwaayyy too heavy-handed. Waayyy too clunky. It made me wonder if Hannah had a television show deal in mind all along, thinking to herself ""and now Goodbye Yellow Brick Road swells in the background"" or ""the camera pans on the bell bottoms/halter top/70s-tastic hair combo I've just described in mind-numbing detail"". The two women of the book, Kate and Tully, represent two starkly different paths a cis-gendered woman can take: family, or power. Hannah has loudly taken a side as to which path she thinks is better.Also, despite spending almost 500 pages with these characters... they somehow still boiled down to their lowest common denominators of loving men and loving nostalgia. Not a great look.I could keep shitting on the book, but I won't. Because, despite everything I said above, it is still readable and entertaining... in a certain setting. Kate and Tully don't shatter any ceilings, but they're a perfectly acceptable way to pass the time. Am I making any sense? I'm not sure. This certainly wasn't what I was expecting after having read The Nightingale but it didn't suck. Does that... help? I'm just talking in circles now, aren't I?I know, I know, I said I'd stop shitting on it. But I can't help myself. Here were the worst parts of the book:Then he left her there, standing alone, surrounded by word ghostsWHAT?!?! The turn-of-phrase ""surrounded by the ghosts of words left unsaid"" is something I've DEFINITELY read before... but Hannah goes with ""word ghosts."" Is that the worst thing I've ever read? I honestly don't know. Twenty-five-year-old college-educated women were expected to dream of more money and higher positions on the corporate ladder and running the very companies that had refused to hire their mothers. Husbands were to be avoided in the pre-thirty years. There was always time for marriage and children; was the common refrain. You don't give up YOU for THEM. But what if you wanted THEM more than you wanted a singular, powerful you? No one ever talked about that.I don't agree with this. Women contemporary to this character don't feel this way (I asked aunts and in-laws and the parents of close friends). So wtf is Hannah talking about? This smacks of anti-feminism, if I'm being honest. Are you starting to get a feel for which path Hannah likes better? It could have been a lonely time - after all, who wanted to see the sights of a magical city like New York alone?Plenty of people. New York is a great city to explore alone. Being alone is a perfectly acceptable way to live a fulfilling life. Stop projecting loneliness onto everyone who is alone.

It had fewer teeth than The Muensters or The Addams Family.To wrassle that sweet, sweet nostalgia, I started watching the 2018 Netflix reboot, The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina. Watching it I thought to myself ""huh, this is dark AF. I'm digging it... but this so is not what the creators had in mind... was it?""So I went back to the comics of the 1960s and, no, Chilling Adventures is something utterly its own in the hall of Sabrinas.

Okay, yeah, there are really only 2 women in the whole book, which is kind of a bummer (though #3, Madam Zhang, is a badass; I'm really hoping we get more of her in the subsequent books). That said, our main character is Zhu Chongba, a young woman who assumed her brother's identity after he died when they were children. Zhu is seeking her destiny: to be great, and to not be the nothing that being a young woman in the 1300s would have otherwise dictated. Zhu Chongba is great. She tries so hard to remove herself from humanity because she doesn't understand it and finds it hard and cruel and just a tool for her to get to her destiny. At the same time, those who love her are trying to pull her into the full technicolor that life can be. Zhu's counterpart is Ouyang, a eunuch Mongol general whose entire family was slaughtered by the father of the man who he now serves. Ouyang is also seeking his destiny: to avenge his ancestors, whose bloodline was unceremoniously cut-off. Ouyang feels even though he desperately doesn't want to; a poignant opposite to how Zhu feels the world around her. I love them both. They are both flawed and hell-bent on a murky purpose to the point that the rest of their vision is fogged in. This book is a just the first installment of what appears to be a sweeping epic. I look forward to the sequel, and will be thinking of Zhu and Ouyang often in the interim....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Oct 19, 2022","Nov 05, 2022","Jul 13, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/48727813-she-who-became-the-sun

Even my mother and mother-in-law, who are about the same age as her, could hardly remember who she is and what she accomplished. Society doesn't value female athletes, and it doesn't value females who don't fit their very narrow and damaging vision of what constitutes ""beautiful."" It's a sin. Lynn Cox deserves better.That makes this book all the more remarkable. Despite a lack of support, Cox smashed world records and successfully completed several swims no one had even attempted before. Despite a lack of recognition, her book resonates with a humble poise, and an awe for the natural world. This book was written in 2004. Most of the swims she chronicles happened before 1992. A lot of people could have grown bitter over those intervening years. Not Cox. She is grateful for what her body can do, what the world has shown her, and the love, joy, and acceptance she received from all the random ""little people"" she met during her adventures.What do I mean by ""little people?"" I mean the every man, the folks who heard what she was attempting and opened their homes, who waited on the shore with slippers, who cheered her on as she cut through water temperatures as low as 32(?!?!?!) degrees. Because Cox received basically no support from corporations or folks who actually had money to throw around. If she had been a man, I guaran-fucking-tee she would have been sponsored up the wazoo. As it was, she emptied her bank account multiple times because she had conviction. She felt what she was doing was important to demonstrating the capabilities of the human body and spirit. If I had been in her shoes, I know I would have given up. At certain times she had a mere handful of people believing in her, but she pushed through. She lived with her parents and worked odd jobs to fund her swims. Corporate America should be ashamed.I'm gonna throw more shade on Corporate America. The most exciting/interesting/incredible part of the book is when she chronicles her Bering Strait swim. After 11yrs of attempting to get permission from both the US and the Soviet Union, she finally resolved to complete it, with or without permission, in 1987. She had a very modest sponsorship from Alaskan Airlines, but other than that no one was willing to help her financially. She was going to attempt a swim in 38 degree water while the iron curtain was still down and the Berlin wall still stood and not a single American company was willing to throw her some funds. Meanwhile, the Soviet-fucking-Union spent more than $1M to facilitate her crossing. THAT'S RIGHT. In the Soviet Union vs. USA tensions, this point goes to the Soviet Union. Just wild. Greedy, stingy, sexist corporate America strikes again! Eat the rich/welcome to the oligarchy/etc./etc.Lynne Cox is an American hero. Her name should be more well known than someone like Tom Brady. What has Tom Brady even really done? Thrown a lil toy to some friends who ran with that toy? Lynne Cox swam in icy waters to bridge a literal and metaphorical gap between nations. Seriously. She swam the Bering Strait on August 7, 1987. Reagan and Gorbachev met in December 1987. It has been called ""The Swim That Lifted the Iron Curtain."" Again, I can't believe how humble and kind her book reads for all the slights she's suffered over the years. I am furious on her behalf. For me, Lynne Cox is the pinnacle of what people can be: strong, persistent, kind, open, awe inspiring.

What's different is that King adapted this one himself. A recent NY TimLisey's Story is the newest Stephen King book to get the adaptation treatment. What's different is that King adapted this one himself. A recent NY Times article quoted King: ""I held onto [Lisey's Story], never expecting I would do anything with it. But I love this book. Ordinarily, I send them off the way you send a kid to college. You hope they do well, but you’re hands off. If they do a great job, you can say, “That was based on my material.” If not, you can say they screwed up. If you’re going to be in it, you’re going to be in it all the way. That’s a big commitment once you get to be 70.""I mention this to underscore the following: Stephen King really, really likes this book. I wonder if it's due to the personal nature of the plot: A widow is attempting to come to terms with the death of her famous-writer husband. In that same NY Times article, King spoke to the inspiration of the book:""I had double pneumonia, and I was in the hospital for a long time. I was very ill, and my wife took the opportunity to redecorate my study, which was old and beat up... After I came out of the hospital, she said: “Maybe you don’t want to go in your office. You won’t like it.” Of course I went up there, and it’s in a transitional state. All the books had been packed in boxes to go back on the shelves. I was on different medications and looked around the office and thought maybe I was dead. That’s what would happen: You’d have to clean out everything after the person died.""Does King see himself as the late Scott Landon? Does he see his wife Tabitha as Lisey Landon, sorting through her husband's things? He claims not, but I do not understand how this book can be one of his favorites. It's probably one of my least.So, Lisey's husband Scott has been dead for two years. She hasn't gotten around to cleaning out his stuff because it's too painful. A visit from an academic seeking to acquire the contents of Scott's study for his university, however, prompts her to speed the heck up. Oh, and also there's a crazy person. And also there's an alternate dimension.I did very much enjoy the pieces of the novel that retell Scott's childhood. Those are tight, devastating, gripping. Also, King's world building of the alternate dimension ""Boo'ya Moon"" is very well done. I can perfectly picture this other world, despite how fantastical it is, and I very much enjoyed those sections of the book.And yet.Because one of the central themes of this book is dealing with grief, we waffle between flashbacks and the present day. We also deal with fragmented thoughts, as grief is wont to do. This can be done well in print. Unfortunately, King doesn't quite hit the mark. There's repetition, and then there's rep.et.tit.ion. King could have illustrated a circular/obsessed/grief addled mind without filling the book with 50+ pages of repetition. It was tedious, and I would start to skim after hitting a passage that had already been repeated 3+ times. Or, how about this passage:Amanda flipped this motorist - almost certainly a man, probably wearing a baseball cap and needing a shave - a double bird, raising her fists to shoulder height and pumping the middle fingers briskly without looking around.""Great technique,"" Lisey said. ""Someday it'll get you raped and murdered.""I fucking hate that passage. Then there's the main character herself. You see, nothing Lisey does makes any damn sense. I am open to suspending disbelief... but I'm not open to just shrugging off common sense. Lisey is arguably one of the stupidest characters I have ever read, and I am very, very angry with her. I'll go into it, but it'll spoil the whole dang book.(view spoiler)[For the sake of brevity, let's just talk about the biggest, stupidest thing about Lisey.Pretend you're a woman in her 60s living alone in Maine. A crazy man comes, threatens your life if you don't do X, and makes it clear that he's going to torture/kill you even if you DO do X.Which sounds like the better idea?1. Call the police, get your tight-knit community/nearby sisters to help you box up your husband's works so nothing bad befalls them, then going to live temporarily with one of your sisters until the cops arrest the madman. Make sure you're never alone, and trust in your local cops. You're a white woman, after all, and the madman already murdered and stuffed a cat in your mailbox. The police are gonna get him.Or2. Call the police, but then decide you don't need them. You don't need your sisters either... well... maybe the catatonic/crazy one. Anyway, you'll hide what's going on from everyone and Home Alone trap that madman, transport him to Boo'ya Moon, and watch one as he is devoured by your late husband's horrific monster called ""Long Boy."" But, and you know this, in following this plan the Long Boy will mark you, and you will live the rest of your days in fear, covering mirrors and avoiding reflections, knowing that one day the Long Boy may claim you the way it tried to claim your husband until he took his last, rattling, breath.WHICH PLAN IS BETTER??!?!?!?!??!

I cam here for the assassination attempt. And while the book ultimately gets there (the last third of the novel is relatively tight, and the prose of the ending bumped this up to 3-stars in my brain), we had to wade through a lot of silliness to get there.Binet asserts that historians should only write about what can be confirmed as fact. He's basically saying that no one should extrapolate in order to create narration. I heartedly disagree. I think that's stupid. I think this book, as a whole, is kinda stupid.

Carmen Maria Machado says right at the top her narrative: every story of abuse is unique. SheI am devastated... and I am cherishing that devastation. Carmen Maria Machado says right at the top her narrative: every story of abuse is unique. She does not expect her story to resonate with most people. She does expect some pushback in the form of ""that's not how I experienced it."" And she understands. She is pre-emptively apologetic if this book misses the mark for those searching for a narrative that mirrors their own abuse experience, but also if this book hits a little too close to home.In the Dream House is a fractured narrative detailing Carmen Maria Machado's real-life abusive relationship with an unnamed woman. The fracturing feels necessary. When you are in an abusive relationship and have turtled into yourself that far, sometimes all you can see of your own life is snippets. You surface for a cruel remark, for crying yourself to sleep, for the waves of shame, for those moments of peace when your significant other isn't around and you feel safe... but you cannot possibly take all of that in at once. Fracturing is required. Like re-breaking a bone to ensure it sets properly, you pre-emptively break yourself so that, when the relationship is finally, mercifully, over, you can heal back to something resembling yourself.Eerie parallels between my abuse story and Machado's abuse story:- The fallout after not picking up a phone call from your long distance girlfriend. This almost always results in many subsequent phone calls and voicemails, the latter of which become increasingly threatening as time goes on. If you went and saw a 2hr movie at the theater, and forgot to turn your phone back on IMMEDIATELY after the credits start to roll? You could be in for a world of pain... and maybe even the middle-of-the-night arrival of said girlfriend.- Having your long distance girlfriend apply to your school, and not get accepted. The avalanche of relief I felt when my ex didn't get accepted to my undergrad program was so much I cried from that, too. Machado's description of that experience: the relief, the shame of the relief, the fear that they'll somehow detect your relief... ugh. - Crying so much on the phone with your girlfriend that the tears get inside and break the phone. Yup. Both Machado and myself did that stupid shit. - This passage: She makes you tell her what is wrong with you. This is a favorite activity; even better than her telling you what is wrong with you. Years later, it's a habit that's hard to break.- This passage: You can feel her anger; you can't see her but the smell of her changes, like a cheap dish towel left on a live electric burner.- And this passage: She loves to walk away from you in places where you know no one, where you have no power, where you can't simply get up and go somewhere.I was able to get out from underneath my abusive relationship in January 2009, but I still feel reverberations from that 3 year span where I was essentially controlled by another person. Like Machado, I don't regret it. It made me into who I am, and who I am got me to the life I have now. I don't want a different life, so I cannot regret those 3 years.There was something so profoundly moving about reading a book written by another queer woman who found herself utterly lost in a person to the point where she temporary lost sight of herself. Machado is so vulnerable and honest about the secrets you horde and the shame that suffocates you in an abusive relationship. I cannot adequately articulate how grateful I am that she put her experience into words, so that I could feel less alone with mine.As her dedication reads: if you need this book, it is for you....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Apr 29, 2021","May 11, 2021","Apr 26, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43317482-in-the-dream-house

It has love and horror and it was fantastic. 5 stars.""The Evening and the Morning and the Night"" was a tough read in a post-COVID world, but was also fantastic.

A young woman is packing up her mother's home after her mother passed. Things are revealed. This is Octavia Butler's formula: she drops us in the middle of a scene, then let's it blossom around us. Honestly, they're best read, then immediately re-read, so you can appreciate those extra layers that are only apparent once you've actually identified the heart of the story. But, in ""Near of Kin,"" the reveal was blase, despite Butler's strong writing. 3 stars. ""Speech Sounds"" was another jarring story in the face of COVID, but I love the idea of a plague that can take speech and/or word comprehension. It was wrenching. 4 stars. ""Crossover"" was a yucky combo of depression and boring despite a supernatural spin. No thanks. 2 stars.""Positive Obsession"" is an essay of Butler's that functions as a sort mini, becoming-a-writer autobiography. It's just fantastic. Take this section: But still I'm asked, what good is any form of literature to Black people? What good is science fiction's thinking about the present, the future, and the past? What good is its tendency to warn or to consider alternative ways of thinking and doing? What good is its examination of the possible effects of science and technology, or social organization and political direction? At its best, science fiction stimulates imagination and creativity. It gets the reader and writer off the beaten track, off the narrow, narrow footpath of what ""everyone is saying, doing, thinking - whoever ""everyone"" happens to be this year. And what good is all this to Black people? 5 stars""Furor Scribendi"" is a 4 page essay that is just saying ""if you want to write then write. A lot."" 2.5 stars.""Amnesty"" is a too-long story about a human conducting a new recruit orientation for other humans to serve an alien race. Oh my god is was so dull and nothing happens and the one real character in the story was so one dimensional. Yeesh. 1.5 stars.""The Book of Martha"" is a dialogue between Martha and God. Butler provides afterwords at the close of each of her stories. For ""Book of Martha"" she said the inspiration came from the idea of utopias, and what if God demanded a human cook up a utopia that would work. I mean... I like that concept, but I really disliked this story. Partly because God isn't real, partly because the writing fell flat in this one. 1 star.

While there were 4 likely suspects, and while the press went craOn January 7, 1969, the body of Jane Britton was discovered in her Harvard apartment. While there were 4 likely suspects, and while the press went crazy over the seemingly ritualistic details of the murder, law enforcement failed to make an arrest. And, as weeks bled into months bled into years, Jane Britton's name was lost to time. Her story slowly morphed into a grotesque myth whispered in the halls of Harvard: a young woman was murdered in the 60s. That professor over there? He totally did it. Becky Cooper heard this story from a friend's boyfriend. It was creepy, but she kind of forgot about it. Then, randomly, the story surfaced in Cooper's life a second time. That second conversation sparked in Cooper a sort of obsession. She dedicated the next 10 years of her life looking into Jane Britton, trying to unravel the mysteries surrounding the late archeology graduate student.I oscillate between 3 of 4 stars for this book. Why the indecision? I can list them in a handy pro/con list:Pro:Parts of the narration really sing.Con:The way author Becky Cooper formatted her book is clunky and awkward. I had to keep reminding myself who different people were. She would spend dozens of pages fleshing out the life of one suspect. Then talk about herself for a while. Then spend dozens of pages talking about a different suspect. It was jarring. Cooper would jump from 1969, to sometime in the early 2010s, to 2018, and back again. Whiplash, much?Pro:The ending was tidy and tight. This is what made the book a 4-star-er for me.Con:The meandering prose the author spent on herself and her personal journey of self-discovery felt awkward and forced.Pro:Becky Cooper and I are the same exact age, so, in a way, I felt as though parts of her floundering echoed my own.Neutral:The murder victim, Jane Britton, still feels like a grainy sketch to me. I know much more about Becky Cooper than I know about Jane Britton. Should that have happened? Should the author have allowed her memoir bits to overshadow the silenced woman she attempted to give a voice? I don't have an answer to that question. Cooper had access to Britton's journals, to her brother, to her best friends. I would think Cooper could have been more verbose about Britton as a person... but maybe she couldn't be. Or maybe she chose to protect parts of Britton. I just... I don't know. Neutral:Cooper very clearly became emotionally involved with several people closest to the murder of Jane Britton. It seemed at times that Britton cultivated a vast network of step-grandparents as she cold called Britton's family, friends, and murder suspects. I give Cooper credit for her guts, and I also wonder if that bonding colored her writing in a way that veers steeply away from investigative journalism. One glaring oversight for me is Cooper not unpacking the system failures she uncovered:1. Harvard's refusal to install basic safety features in a building they owned, which is objectively partially responsible for the murder2. The insane level of law enforcement incompetency. (view spoiler)[The revelation at the tail-end of the book? That a cop planted evidence and attempted to pin the murder on some random man in Britton's periphery? That that same cop continues to be celebrated by the larger law enforcement body despite being CAUGHT doing something so despicable? I wanted more of that. I wanted Cooper to eviscerate those responsible. But she didn't. Considering how close she got to so many people in the 10yrs she worked on this book I get it, I guess. But it felt as though so much was left unsaid in that area, and that this silence does a bit of disservice to Britton's memory. (hide spoiler)] At the end of the day, I am happy this book exists, and I think Cooper did a pretty good job. I applaud her for breathing interest and life back into a senseless killing of a Promising Young Woman (tm). So many women become nameless victims, like Britton had become when Cooper was first introduced to her story. Let's bring these names to light. Let's remember. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"May 25, 2021","Jun 02, 2021","Feb 20, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52041387-we-keep-the-dead-close

""Feel like reading it and telling me what you think?""At 288 pages, Nora Krug's multimedia/graphic novel Belonging isn't exactly a time sink. I said yes, knowing absolutely nothing about this book. I'm not sure what I was expecting going into it, but it certainly wasn't the emotionally poignant sucker punch I received. Born in Germany in 1977 and moving to New York in her 20s, Krug straddles two worlds. She very much grew up feeling a very particular aftershock of World War II.""I understood that THE WAR was a loud and deadly event,"" she writes. ""We learned that the German word for RACE should only be used to distinguish animal species, and ETHNIC only in the context of genocides... we didn't learn that tens of thousands of Germans had been killed for resisting the Nazi regime (because it would have made our grandparents who didn't resist look guiltier in comparison?), or that 150,000 men of Jewish descent had fought in the WEHRMACHT (because their participation would have made us feel less guilty?) ...Because we never learned about contemporary Jewish culture, we associated the word JUDE strictly with the Holocaust and we understood that it could be uttered only in a whisper.""When she moves to New York, Krug is overwhelmed by the pride in German heritage she witnesses. A parade of people waving small German flags makes her uncomfortable. She is still trying to actively mask her German accent when talking with strangers. Listening to Americans who knew so much about their familial history made Krug realize she didn't actually know a whole lot about her own......so she decided to find out.That context alone can tell you that what Krug found out was a smidge... difficult. It... yeah.I call this book a multimedia book rather than a straight up graphic novel because Krug intersperses photocopies of letters and discharge papers. She pastes in old photographs. She presses flowers on the edges. It's a beautiful book to look at, and her small, loopy handwriting and delicate drawings are the perfect contrast to reading about the hate and fear of World War II. It's an especially scary right now, considering the current global political climate.We don't talk much about the non-Jewish German experience in World War II. For all of the books that have come out, for all of the films we've seen... JoJo Rabbit is the only one I can think of, I think? And that's pretty new to the canon. As Krug puts it: Germans aren't allowed to talk about their experiences, they are meant only to feel shame. In her search through the past, though, Krug gave us a glimpse into how gray that shame can be. And for that I thank her.PS. I gave this 4 stars rather than 5 because, while beautiful, this book is friggin' confusing. Krug looks into both sides of her family, and keeps jumping from one side to the other. It was wildly difficult to keep track of which grandfather/aunt/cousin she was talking about now, and how they related to the wider web of family. I wish she had split this book between maternal and paternal, so you got one full story, and then another full story. Her way made everything muddy and confusing... though maybe that was the point? ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Feb 03, 2021","Feb 08, 2021","Jan 14, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/38531325-belonging

The young children, particularly Chauncey and Sal, are perfect characters. They both made me cry. A book that makes me cry surely deserves more than 3 stars, no?I admit, I was conflicted.Here's where I ended up.TJ Klune isn't a good writer. I'm sorry, but it's true. His prose lack, he's very repetitive, and he struggles to develop the growth arc of his characters. Because of this last piece, we're left at the end of his tales going ""wait... how did we get here?"" His love story in ...Cerulean Sea made a little more sense than ...Whispering Door, but it was still woefully underdeveloped. I honestly wish TJ Klune would sell his ideas to good authors. Like a song writer sells their wares to voices that bring the heart and the depth: Klune has great ideas, but isn't able to fully bring them to life.That doesn't make this a bad book. It contains within it a really lovely message about loving yourself for who you are, about the family you choose, about seeking community regardless of what the outside world has told you about yourself. It beseeches its readers to stay curious and never give up on finding love and acceptance if that's what you want. It's out there, Klune tells us, you just have to go find it. And wow, what a powerful message. It's just, well, Klune's writing doesn't add anything shiny or sparkly to this message. It's there, yes, and Klune repeats it several times lest we find ourselves too dense to pick it up. But I walked away from this book sort of feeling like that message had been said to me in a monotone voice. I still heard it, but it lacked the punch it should have had.Also, if Sal ""bit his lip"" or Talia ""preened"" one more time I was going to start a petition to wipe the respective phrase and word from our collective consciousness. Use a thesaurus goddamnit. Wow, okay, that got angry. To be repetitive like our buddy Klune: ...Cerulean Sea is a nice story poorly told. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Mar 21, 2024","Mar 29, 2024","Jan 05, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/52483192-the-house-in-the-cerulean-sea

I think I'm qualified to weigh in at this point.Elaine Khosrova, for her part, is certainly qualified to write this book. A CIA (not the spy one) alumna and former staff writer at several food magazines, she has spent quite some time with the golden fat that gives brownies their shiny, crackly tops, and pie crusts the ideal tender flakiness (sorry vegans). The book is laid out well. We begin with a vignette in Bhutan, where a family collects the morning yak milk. From there, Khosrova walks us through how humans began making and consuming butter in the first place, the many uses of butter in and out of the culinary universe, the rise of butter's popularity, the rise of butter industrialization, the ""fat ban"" in the latter half of the 20th century, the artisanal reboot of butter in the 21st, and, finally, a closing vignette at the CIA (still not the spy one). Khosrova dedicates the final ~75 pages of her book to recipes where butter is the star ingredient: crumb cake, shortbread, puff pastry, butterscotch pudding, lemon curd. And even gives us appendixes on recommended butters and how to say butter in a myriad of languages. She's betraying what a Type A person she is and I love it.Okay, if I loved it, what's with the stingy star giving? Do I realize I only gave this book 3 stars?Ugh, I know. And I'm so upset about it. You see, I really really loved most of this book. The history of butter? Fascinating! And I could read anecdotes such as these forever:Some of the ways early Swedish farmwives helped ensure their dairy luck against spirits and stealers were by breathing into the milking pail before commencing to milk or passing the milk pail over the fire three times. More extreme measures also existed, particularly around the widespread belief that, by making a pact with the devil, a witch could virtually steal the milk of other farmers, without ever having to cross their property. According to Swedish lore, once that deal was struck, the person (invariably a woman) invoked the milk theft ritually, by standing naked on a tall pile of manure and calling out, ""The milk is mine as far as my cry is heard.""But my love of this book was dashed to pieces once we got to chapter 9: The Modern Buttersmith: Small Batches, Big Fans. In it she provides mini profiles on several artisanal buttersmiths, mainly in the USA and Western Europe. The TL;DR version of this chapter is as follows:We are moving away from industrialized, poor quality butter, and can start to get the good stuff. Here are some people making the good stuff. 99% of us will never, ever taste the good stuff, because restaurants serving billionaires buy up their entire supply and leave nothing for everyone else.And she just tells us that. Like it's a good thing.HOW IS THAT A GOOD THING.Like, I get it. It's great that individuals who excel in their craft are compensated well. And it's exciting that people can make a decent living farming again. That's good. Important, even, as we turn our collective eye toward minimizing climate change and sourcing our foods locally. But this shit isn't local. This is a billionaire getting his rich butter private jet-ed to his favorite restaurant hundreds if not thousands miles away. And that? I mean... fuck that. That is a perfect example of exactly what is wrong in our society. These buttersmiths are making a product and then shipping it out of the community to service the rich. Everyone else can go on eating the supermarket brand stuff that Khosrova herself says isn't very good at all. But fuck us, right? We didn't win at capitalism, so we don't deserve the stuff.To be fair, Khosrova didn't tell me to go fuck myself in her book. But it kind of felt like that, since she refused to touch the classism here with a 10 foot pole. I know this book is about butter, but you brought class into it by talking about French Laundry. I'll never eat at French Laundry... most of us won't. And there's a glaring reason as to WHY we won't be. To ignore it was negligent. Our society is broken; butter is just another canary is this toxic coal mine. Whew. So, yeah. A good book that made a colossal mistake by introducing how broken the current butter market is and refusing to comment on that fact.

I understand the environment, the perils, the stark and water-starved existence on this planet. He also has a great imagination: for weapons, for creatures, for supernatural abilities of man.So, yes, Dune is objectively a cornerstone of contemporary science fiction. I will not deny it its place in the canon.But something that is foundational does not necessary stand the test of time.My old, boring song-and-dance about the portrayal of women in the science fiction and fantasy genres is old hat. Suffice to say it did not surprise me at all that there is a total of ONE fleshed out female in 600+ pages of book. This one female, Jessica, starts out strong. She is a ""Bene Gesserit,"" a class of women, sometimes called ""witch,"" who are able to command people to obey by carefully controlling their voices. They are adept at reading people, at anticipating what someone is about to do. This has all the makings of a strong, kickass female character. And Jessica is... for the most part. But her relationship with other women is fraught with issue (this book does NOT pass The Bechdel test). This is seen most clearly at the close of the book. (view spoiler)[Jessica sidles up to Chani, her son's concubine (Herbert's word), as her son, Paul, moves to marry a princess in order to stop war and take control. Jessica says: ""Think on it, Chani: the princess will have the name, yet she'll live as less than a concubine-never to know the moment of tenderness from the man to whom she's bound. While we, Chai, we who carry the name of the concubine-history will call us wives."" AND THAT'S THE END OF THE BOOK. This is fucking horrible. The princess is a stranger to Jessica. She has not wronged Jessica, Paul, or any of the Fremen in any way. Her only crime thusfar is being the daughter of the Emperor. Who cares though, right? Let's pit the few women in this book against each other because all that matters is who gets the love of a man.At the risk of being dramatic: this utterly ruined Jessica for me. (hide spoiler)]Second, boring critique of sci-fi/fantasy: the (always male) protagonist is a lawful good character who is the smartest/strongest/bestest at everything. Paul might be the worst iteration of that I've ever seen.The meat of the story, Paul going into the desert and realizing his ""terrible purpose,"" starts when he is fifteen years old. Do you remember what you were like at fifteen? Because, let me tell you, I was not felling grown men who fight in the greatest army the galaxy has ever seen WITHOUT EVEN GETTING A SCRATCH. I was not able to spend five seconds in another culture and figure out exactly how to fit in. I was not able to see the future for reasons that are not adequately explored. Sure, Herbert tries to wave all this off with veiled references to Paul having a Bene Gesserit mother who ""chose"" to have a son when she was ordered to have a daughter. Also, Paul has this ineffable divinity, and Herbert thinks that should be good enough for us. I'm all for some mystery; you don't have to spoon feed me everything. But for a man who so richly built his world, it was baffling that he'd build characters and then be like ""and also they can see the future because I said so and also destiny.""Dune boils down to the following for me: a beautifully crafted fictional world that houses little cardboard people lacking depth.

At the ripe age of 7, in 1996, I started developing my own taste. Considering the mishmash of parental influence, it surprised no one that I was blasting Spice Girls and Backstreet Boys back-to-back with Nirvana and Red Hot Chili Peppers.What I'm trying to impress is: I've been a fan. When a high school boyfriend burned me a CD with Suck My Kiss on it, I knew it was love.My husband, knowing my fandom, has been trying to get me to read this book for a few years. He read it back in college, and thought I'd really enjoy it. I finally relented, in this, the year of our lord(TM) 2020.Some parts I really enjoyed... and some parts... I... well... fuck, okay, let's just get into it. Anthony Kiedis' autobiography, ghost written by Larry Sloman, spans from when Kiedis was a wee babe in the late 60s/early 70s, all the way up to the ""present,"" ie the early 2000s. He was born to very young parents whose tumultuous relationship did not last long. Complaint #1: Kiedis is very cavalier about the fact that his dad repeatedly abandoned his mother and himself. I mean, I understand forgiveness, but, like, take your dad to task, man. He's a real piece of shit.Speaking of his dad being a piece of shit: his dad would take him to clubs when he was very young (like, younger than 12), and allowed him to smoke weed back then too. When Kiedis was approaching his 12th birthday, he asked his dad if he could have sex with the 18yr old girl who was hanging around the house sometimes. His dad was like ""sure, son, 11yrs old is the time to lose your virginity."" The 18yr old girl was for it, apparently, so 11yr old Anthony Kiedis was raped by an adult woman.Kiedis' reflection on this goes: She guided me the whole way, and she was very loving and gentle, and it was all pretty natural... It was a fun thing to do, and I never felt traumatized then, but I think subconsciously it was probably something that always stuck with me in a weird way. I didn't wake up the next morning going ""Geez, what the hell was that?"" I woke up wanting to go brag about it to my friends...Kiedis doesn't unpack the rape more than this.In the ""second half of 10th grade,"" which, to my estimations, puts Kiedis at 15yrs old, he gets crazily injured, and is laid up at home. He says:I spent the next few weeks horizontal in my own bed. I got some lovely visitations from a friend of my father's named Lark, who was a beautiful, relatively successful twenty-something actress. She came by at all hours, during the day, late at night, whenever, just to fix me up sexually... I had to keep telling her to be real careful, but I was getting absolutely ridden by a wild nymphomaniac banshee.Kiedis has now been raped by two different adult women.By the time Kiedis reaches adulthood himself, and is touring with his band, he is laser-focused on sex and drugs. He tells one story about a ""Marilyn Monroe-esque vixen"" who he has sex with a few times. When she reveals that she is actually only 14yrs old, he recalls:So we had sex one more time, and she gave me an interesting compliment that I never forgot. She said, ""When you make love to me, it's like you're a professional.Now you're the rapist, Kiedis. He then meets Ione Leitch, a girl he dates for ~1yr, who he met ""a few days before her sixteenth birthday."" Statutory rape. Again. A 24yr old dating a 16yr old is... yeech. Hard subject change: at one point Kiedis just casually puts in the book ""I never wore a seatbelt. Still don't."" Which reeeaalllyy pissed me off. I assume all these young idiots read this book and stopped wearing seatbelts in order to be cool... like Anthony Kiedis. Why are you acting like not wearing a seatbelt is cool, asshole?Listen, this book is interesting. Kiedis is very honest about his drug addiction, and there are some fantastic looks into the relationships between famous bands of the early 90s. However, I walked away from this book with the following tastes in my mouth:1. Anthony Kiedis has experienced and doled out a lot of trauma. Considering the tenor of this book, he hadn't even begun to try to work through any of that as of 2004 (the publication of this autobiography). And, considering he had a son in 2017 with an 18yr old (he was 41), I don't think he ever really tried.2. Anthony Kiedis is a narcissist.3. Poor Flea. Kiedis says he realizes he was a real piece of shit to his bandmates and his family and everyone who cares/d about him. But those are just words. There is no evidence that Kiedis ever actually attempted to make amends with anyone, nor does it seem like he was ever really there for anyone the way they were there for him. Considering his narcissistic personality, I'm pretty sure Kiedis would be trumpeting any/all efforts he made. But he's uncharacteristically silent on that front. So, I'm left to conclude that Anthony Kiedis is a really bad, albeit traumatized, person.I honestly don't know if I'd recommend this to anyone. Despite not having yet read it, I'd probably say you're better off reading Flea's Acid for the Children. Scar Tissue is a drug and sex riddled story of depravity written by a man incapable of reflecting on what his actions have done to other people, and how the trauma of his youth paved the way for him being a real POS. If you're into that, go for it. But Flea deserves the royalties more, so get this book from the library.PS. Another ridiculous part of this book was Kiedis talking about grinding it in the beginnings of Red Hot Chili Peppers. Sonny Bono was your godfather. Cher was your babysitter. The clubs your dad took you to as a prepubescent were crawling with the likes of Led Zeppelin. You were always in the middle of it, man. Don't play.PPS. This quote: We got into trouble with Warner's again when we used Gavin for our ""Aeroplane"" video. He came up with a super treatment: an expansive ode to Busby Berkeley, feature a huge chorus line of half-naked, hot-costumed Mexican cholitas, tough gangster girls with heavy makeup and sweeping hair. We wanted lots of semi-nudity and sexy dancing and chewing of gum and blowing of bubbles... But a lady from Warner's was supervising the shoot, and it turned out that she was a PC feminist.WTF is a ""PC feminist?"" That offensive, throwaway comment really, truly underscores for me how much of a clueless asshole Anthony Kiedis is. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,Dec 2020,"Dec 18, 2020","Dec 01, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/96647.Scar_Tissue

Chapter 2 is part whale life (gestation, migration, etc.), which was GREAT. However, a lot of that chapter was also about the people on a whale watching boat with the author during an excursion (boring, stupid), and more about how humans have decimated both whale populations and their main food source (depressing, hopeless). Chapter 3 had some information on evolution (v. cool) and whales in culture (still cool). BUT the majority of the chapter was about the author's experience in a museum she used to visit as a child. And, at that point, I was so done with the fractured narration I had to put the book down.Honestly, if the book wasn't written by a drunken grad student, I may have limped on, but everything detailed above, + everything detailed below, was too much to take.Drunken grad student? Well, if you didn't read my update WHILE I was still trying to read this book, I shared that I had to stop reading this book at night. Why? Because I had to keep a post-it and pen next to me while I was reading for jotting down the words I didn't know. Since I have a strict no-screens-before-bed policy, I had to wait until the next day to look those words up. This made me feel stupid. So I'd lay in bed, thinking ""holy shit... am I stupid?"" The next morning I would look up these words and realize: nope, I'm not stupid. Rebecca Giggs just wrote this book with a thesaurus open in her lap... and some of her archaic vocabulary wasn't even used correctly. So, instant flashbacks to college when assholes with word-of-the-day calendars taking Philosophy 101 would spew nonsense over buckets of Keystone. Here are some words I didn't know. When I asked some of my (fellow English MA) friends, none of them knew any of these words either. That should tell you something, Giggs. If you Google synonyms, then see the word hasn't been used in 200yrs... maybe don't. It makes both you and your book off-putting.-Exigencies-Insuperable -Midden-Pellucid-Peregrinations (this was one of the words that was used incorrectly) I could go on, but you get the gist.

In anticipation of the film ""The United States vs. Billie Holiday,"" I wanted to read a biography on the jazz legend. Doing some preliminary research on biographies out there, I was... unimpressed. There wasn't much to choose from, and what was there had met lukewarm s. When a recent New Yorker article mentioned Julia Blackburn's With Billie, my decision was made for me. If my favorite news outlet was citing this book, it had to be the one to read... right?To say this book is unreadable feels histrionic. Other people have read this book... so clearly it can be read... but... like... why put yourself through it?Julia Blackburn decided to write a biography on Billie Holiday, and was given access to all the notes and interviews completed by prior Holiday bio hopeful Linda Kuehl. As Blackburn puts it, Kuehl never got through the first chapters. It seems, to Blackburn, that Kuehl lacked the skills to actually write the book, and was better at the information gathering portion of the process. When Kuehl committed suicide, her research sat for ~30 years until Blackburn came around to save it. What I'm trying to say is: Blackburn copied someone else's homework and also thought she did it better.The fact that Blackburn throws shade on the late Kuehl is hilarious, in the most literal sense (that is, it's so amusing it threatens to drive one insane). Blackburn's book is a hodge podge of contradictory quotes from those who knew Billie Holiday or followed parallel timelines to the woman. It reads nonsensically, because Blackburn was unable to put these notes together in a cohesive format. Blackburn often jumps in with her own observations, which usually amount to ""what you just read has been contradicted by people, so, who knows what is true,"" or ""this person was clearly high/drunk when they were remembering, so, take this with a grain of salt."" Great. Helpful.Speaking of high/drunk, Blackburn is such a holier-than-thou shamer in this book. A lot of the people who were interviewed by Kuehl were involved with drugs and/or prostitution, and Blackburn is overtly sticking her nose in the air about this. Like, bitch, what do you expect? When you've been ground into the dirt by systemic racism and oppression, but you still need money to live, you have no choice but to turn to self-employment. In the 1930s? That looks a lot like drugs and prostitution. Apologize. It's also clear from the text that Blackburn is judging Holiday for the fact that she often found herself in abusive relationships, going as far as to note that some people claimed Holiday enjoyed being abused. Blackburn, as far as I read, doesn't even try to unpack what this meant with regards to Holiday's feeling of self-worth or depression. Nor does she unpack the archaic outlooks on abuse that many of Kuehl's aged interviewees likely held. So, that's great and not problematic at all......I've read oral histories before. Live from New York is a book I consistently recommend to people. But this isn't an oral history. This isn't even a biography. It's a hurried mess of cut/paste first-person anecdotes that are immediately contradicted by the next person. It's not clear if Blackburn was too lazy or just too poor a writer to turn this into an actual book, but lord knows I'm not hanging around to try and find out....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Nov 22, 2020","Nov 24, 2020","Nov 22, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/976899.With_Billie

I knew it would be upsetting, not just because it chronicles the death of a young man who didn't have to die, but because I would see so much of myself and those I love in Chris McCandless. I surround myself with men who thrive in the outdoors, and I am never happier than when I am camping deep in the woods. So, reading this? Felt like it would be an emotional experience. Well, I finally read the book, and, unsurprisingly, I did cry at the end.I'm going to ""spoil"" below, because 1. it's a true story and 2. it's an older book at this point. If you don't want to know what happened to Chris McCandless, don't read on. In the early 90s, a young man named Chris McCandless graduated from Emory University, packed up his car, and headed west. He lived off of the land, off of the kindness of strangers, and off his cunning for a year. The whole time he had a final goal in mind: get up to Alaska and live wild. His family had no idea where he had disappeared to, and he had adopted the moniker Alexander Supertramp. Intelligent and gregarious, McCandless successfully hitch-hiked from South Dakota to the Stampede Trail outside of Denali National Park. There, he bunked down in an abandoned bus, with no map and few provisions, determined to live off what Alaska had to offer. After roughly 113 days, in August 1992, Chris McCandless perished in the wilderness of Alaska, due to a suspected combination of ingesting toxic seeds and starvation.The book is devastating for a number of reasons:1. McCandless, though he thought he was in the wilderness, was actually less than 6 miles from what we would call civilization. He was near Denali National Park, near a few privately owned seasonal cabins, and near a bucket-and-pulley system for fording the Teklanika River.2. His family seems to have genuinely loved him and been worried about him. They just tried to make him into someone he wasn't... as parents often do, and McCandless' response was to flee.3. He was very intelligent and was actually surviving successfully in the wilderness. It was a combination of bad luck and brashness that seems to have killed him.4. He actually tried to exit the Stampede Trail roughly one month prior to his death. The Teklanika River was in full flood mode at that time, though, and so he decided to return to his base camp and wait the river out. Little did he know, that the aforementioned bucket-and-pulley system was not too far down the river from where he attempted to ford it. He could have left. Instead he died. Krakauer was the exact person to write this story, as he saw so much of himself in the story of McCandless. It's tragic that McCandless became a cautionary tale instead of our next Thoreau or Muir. PS. In doing some research after finishing the book, I read that the bus where McCandless bunked and died was removed from the Stampede Trail as of June 2020, because unprepared trekkers kept going out there and requiring emergency evacuation services. PLEASE, if you want to do backcountry camping and hiking, read up, be prepared, and PRACTICE. Don't waste the time, money, and safety of others because you need them to save your dumb ass. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Nov 12, 2020","Nov 22, 2020","Nov 12, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1845.Into_the_Wild

Vasya is still fierce, independent, and intuitive. However, she must now hide her womanness, because this is medieval Russia, and women are meant to be locked away from prying eyes (perhaps... locked... in a tower?!?!). Arden is still tackling the cage that can be gender in The Girl in the Tower. She also begins to lean more heavily into the fantasy aspect of her world. Since the reader already has the groundwork from book #1, here we are introduced to the layered world of cheryti, or Russian Folklore. We meet more spirits of the ancient world, and Arden begins to tease how they may influence Man. We also get battle and village scenes, to flesh out the society Vasya must navigate through. As has been lamented by many before me, and by past versions of myself, describing the middle installment of a trilogy is incredibly difficult. You don't want to give too much away, and don't want to put your projections for book #3 out there, for fear of a two-for-one deal of spoilers. Suffice to say Arden has stayed true to a strong female fantasy series, and I thank her for it.(view spoiler)[If I liked the book so much, why only 4 stars? Well, it's because of that clunky romance between Vasya and Morozko. Do they actually have feelings for each other, or are their interludes a byproduct of her wearing his necklace? Is he actually becoming human, or is he just presenting himself as most human to more entice her? Do they actually want to kiss, or are they compelled by external, spiritual forces? It just feels kinda icky and coerced to me. Vasya did not have a choice to wear the necklace, and the necklace bound herself to him. Despite how strong she is, is she just, ultimately, his puppet? Arden attempts to clear this up when Vasya shatters the necklace and when Morozko is all ""I didn't expect... you,"" but that scene didn't mop up all the gross on the floor of my brain when it comes to that relationship. Also, was the Tamara twist of book 2 (a great twist, btw) a nod to what Vasya's fate will be? We've known since book 1 that book 3 will likely be the death of Vasya... what will that look like? And will it ruin her for me? I'm not sure I'm ready to find out.

Almost all of the public spaces have shuttered and/or fallen into disrepair, because the citizens of Grafton hate one thing above all: taxes. Screw the roads, screw having a fire department, screw having access to information (aka a library). Payment into these things should be voluntary. If people really wanted them, they would voluntarily pay for them.Well, no one pays. But they sure as hell complain.It is not clear just how many years author and journalist Matthew Hongoltz-Hetling spent trying to crack into the psychology of the citizens of Grafton, but he paints a picture that extends as far back as the 1700s, all the way up to late 2019 (the book was published in 2020). He documents how bustling the town was in the 19th century, thanks to farming and mining, and how it grew sleepy as the 20th century roared into view. By the 1970s Grafton was all but abandoned... until the libertarians came to town. When it comes to ideals, the libertarian view isn't half bad: personal autonomy, anti-capitalism, freedom of choice, skepticism of authority... but like most political philosophies, the libertarian view can quickly be perverted into something wildly broken and inefficient. This crystalized in the town of Grafton, NH. Libertarians flocked to the town thanks to its low taxes and lack of oversight. However, those who took up residence didn't want to deal with paying for things like a fire department or snow plowing. They just wanted to hunker down with their guns and live and let live.Also, there are very unafraid bears living in the town.Hongoltz-Hetling tries to be fair to the people he interviewed, despite how crazy they seem to an outsider (read: me). He also tries to be fair to the bears, and I gotta say I was conflicted about them myself. I understand needing to cull populations that get out of control; we made ourselves to be gods and have to get comfortable playing god. Our intervention on this planet has resulted in broken ecosystems, and we gotta step up. That said, unlike deer, bears hold a special place in my heart. So it's hard for me to think about killing them, even for the greater ecological good. Fair he may be, but Hongoltz-Hetling oversteps in his narrative, to a distracting degree. He spends an entire chapter talking about typhus and toxoplasmosis, ultimately suggesting that the bears and the people of Grafton alike owe their fearlessness and aggression, respectively, to being infected with toxoplasmosis. He has absolutely 0 proof that this is the case. Most people infected present with absolutely no signs or symptoms. I worked at a vet clinic for a decade, and let me tell you, most people have toxoplasmosis. It doesn't make you more inclined to own a gun or be aggressive, and Hongoltz-Hetling was wildly irresponsible putting this theory forth, even with his hedging language that it's just a hypothesis. A quick bit of googling shows me that a lot of black bears also have toxoplasmosis... it is not unique to the bears of Grafton, NH. Suggesting that their odd behavior stems from the infection is nonsensical. You're not a scientist, man, stay in your lane.My other, rather petty complaint was how Hongoltz-Hetling attempted to be hip with his audience. Chapter-ending quips like: ""but maybe bears (it was totally bears)"" made me feel like I was sitting through one of my dad's bad jokes. It was slightly uncomfortable, and definitely took me out of the book. I came here to learn about a sociological experiment and about some unique bears... not to have the writer insert himself with his fun&cool asides.At the end of the day, A Libertarian Walks into a Bear is a lighthearted book about what modern day community experiments look like, as well as a cautionary tale of how human interaction with the environment really fucks up the environment. But this book wasn't anything brain shattering. I'll be lending out my copy, sure, but I won't be banging down doors demanding folks buy their own. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jan 16, 2021","Jan 25, 2021","Oct 11, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50358538-a-libertarian-walks-into-a-bear

But after the 10th time he mentioned it (his not finishing it after 10+ months was not a ringing endorsement, by the way), I figured what the hell, if it got him to shh about it already. If nothing else, I could impress said friend with my superior reading skills.As the book began, it seemed like I wasn't going to enjoy it. It read more YA than anything else, and felt a smidge plodding. As I described it to my husband in those first 50 pages: ""I mean, it's fun. But it's just kinda... there. It's good brain candy, I guess?""But then Arden got into religion, and I fell in love.Firstly, the main character, Vasilisa/Vasya, is a friggin' heroine. She is young, but she is fiercely independent and intelligent and clever. I'm a broken record in saying so much fantasy relegates women to the sidelines. In The Bear and the Nightingale, Arden acknowledges this trope through the other women in Vasya's life. However, Arden simultaneously shatters through feminine cliches with each action Vasya takes. It is so damn refreshing to read a woman who is brave, who doesn't need a man, who knows that she is enough.The thing that really hooked me, as previously mentioned, is Arden's commentary on religion. One of the chief conflicts of this first installment of her trilogy is when the new priest arrives in town. Konstantin is young, handsome, charismatic, and bored AF having been transferred from Moscow to this sleepy, frigid land. So Konstantin decides he is going to Christian up the joint, hard. Arden effortlessly depicts what early Christianity looked like in rural communities of old. While people accepted the idea of Christianity, they also kept to their old religions: leaving offerings for the spirits, respecting the pagan customs. Konstantin is not about that, and uses fear (you know, something new and different for Christianity), to scare the townsfolk away from tradition.This is fantasy book, however, and so those spirits, the ones the townsfolk abandon, are very real. And, having neglected their customs, the townspeople begin to suffer.I just love how Arden plays with the tension between new religion and old religion. It is so well done, and using the lens of a young woman, still innocent yet becoming more curious, was masterful. I'd hate to say more lest I give too much away, but Vasya is the female hero I've been waiting for. While everyone else cowers behind their new God, she alone will try and save her people. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Oct 12, 2020","Oct 27, 2020","Sep 13, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25489134-the-bear-and-the-nightingale

King's stories rarely get me thinking, they (and this may be cruel, but) rarely have anything of actual importance to say. Imagine my surprise.The Running Man takes place in a version of 2025. Here, most people live in incredible poverty. Sick from pollution, unable to work decent jobs, even when they are otherwise qualified. Most people are written off as drug addicts, ""maggots,"" the scourge of ""good society."" This ""good society"" consists of a small number of (white, wealthy) people, who live above the muck and the smog.Ben Richards, one of these so-called ""maggots,"" cannot afford medicine for his baby daughter. To give her a shot at life, he heads over to the Games Network. Here, a ""maggot"" can have a real shot at good money. Sure, you might be maimed or killed in this new breed of reality television, but your corpse will be rich.The shocking thing about this book (written in 1982) is how much our current reality kind of feels like a precursor to a Running Man type of existence. Will we, now, correct course? Or will we turn Stephen King into a Cassandra?PS. There is still some weird race shit in this book. Because of course there is. It's Stephen King.

Because what's a dystopian year without a dystopian book to complement it?Stephen King wrote The Long Walk as a freshman in college. As he tells it, he submitted the story somewhere, and, upon receiving a rejection letter, stored the thing until many years had passed and his publisher asked him if he had more planned for his shiny new pseudonym ""Richard Bachman."" Out came the manuscript, spinoffs, and film adaption hopes from the likes of George Romero. It makes you wonder how many good manuscripts are just molding away in trunks, external hard drives, the cloud, etc. The Long Walk chronicles an American competition. 100 men are chosen, from applications willingly submitted, to compete in a Walk. Starting in Maine, the Walk continues south until there's only one man left standing. That final contestant is the Winner. His prize? Anything he wants. Seem too good to be true? Is there a catch, mayhaps? How very astute of you. There is a catch, for the losers. But I'm not about to tell you what it is.King is tackling a lot in this slim novel. He is commenting on class disparity, on exploitation, on one's inability to assess risk when wealth and fame is on the line. Told through the eyes of one contestant, Garraty, King details men at their bravado-est, and their most vulnerable and broken down. The Long Walk is Marx, pulp edition.I could only give it 3 stars due to the normal King shortcomings. The racial tension he inserts into his book is unsettling. Not in a ""you really made me think about that,"" but in a ""fuck, man, you shouldn't be writing that."" The gender tension is equally icky. I mean, I get it, we're in the head of a teenage boy. But it's not to my taste, and so it colored how I received the book. The Long Walk is also sketchy. That is, the history of the world he's created sits in the reader's mind as a faint sketch, rather than rich and deep. It's likely intentional, but I could have used a bit more meat to the concept of the Walk and the society that created it; it would have made Garraty's journey all the more harrowing and meaningful. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Sep 04, 2020","Sep 07, 2020","Sep 04, 2020",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9014.The_Long_Walk

This book is a biography, sure, but it reads like My First Biography. It's got a bunch of charts and graphs, and wide margins and blank pages, so, though it clocks in at about 200 pages, it's more like ~170. I'm not trying to shit on Alexis Coe for the slightness of her book; she set out to provide a broad/basic retelling of George Washington's life, and achieved that goal. Plus, where she does focus in are areas that have only been lightly touched by those who came before her. Namely, his relationship to women and slavery. I would have liked more meat to the book, hence the rating, but I do appreciate her unique view and voice in well-traversed territory. Alexis Cole joins a veritable choir of voices, mostly male, who have weighed in on George Washington's life and legacy. She begins her book by knocking out some myths that are untrue (no cherry trees were felled; his teeth were made, not of wood, but of animal ivory and slave teeth), and let's us know that most biographers (who she calls ""thigh men,"" which is hilarious and which I will not explain) focus on what a pillar of America he is, and gloss over the fact that he was, like, human, and thus had flaws... and some bad ones at that.Retelling a biography in  form is boring to even think about, so I won't do it. What I will do is say that I very much enjoyed Coe's bravery in standing up in a room of reverie and yelling ""MOTHER MARY WASN'T A FRIGID BITCH. MARTHA WASN'T COLD AND BARREN. WASHINGTON WASN'T BRAVE FOR PUTTING THAT THING ABOUT FREEING SLAVES IN HIS WILL.""1. Relying solely on first-person accounts and historical documents, there is no evidence that Mary was a shitty mom. All of that seems to have been made up by the thigh men in the intervening years. Did/do they hate women? I mean, probably.2. In the same vein, a lot of historians have blamed Martha for George Washington not having any biological children. It's important to note that Martha came into the marriage with two children from her previous marriage, and that there is nothing in the historical documents to suggest that she was no longer able to have kids. PLUS, Washington had suffered from many illnesses in his youth that could have rendered him impotent. But the thigh men can't handle that their boi Washington wasn't anything but virile, and so they heap bullshit on Martha. PS. maybe they just didn't want to have more kids? That's also possible, but whatever #pulloutworkswhendonecorrectly3. Many of Washington's contemporaries were freeing their slaves and were on the ""right"" side of history during his lifetime. His inability to move abolition forward while he was in office is inexcusable. Additionally, his whole ""once Martha's dead my slaves can be free"" was fucked up for a couple of reasons. a) just free them, dude. b) Martha lived in fear of his slaves until her death, because she was their only obstacle to freedom, and she treated them with fear aka shittily. c) After so many years of marriage, Martha's slaves and Washington's slaves had married and had kids with one another. When Martha died, she gave her slaves away, seemingly at random, to several family members, while Washington's slaves went free. Families were ripped apart; many never saw one another again. So, yea, a wealthy (he often cried poverty, but was full of shit) white man in the 18th century wasn't a great dude.

Most of what I know, actually, stems from that smash 1997 animated feature Anastasia. It's not clear how much of that had, you know, anything to do with reality (talking bats? Rasputin as zombie? But, hey, I learned the word ""dasvidaniya"" so... points?), but Romanov, at least, is a name I recognize. I didn't come to Catherine the Great, however, due to her ties to the Ramonovs (her husband was a descendant). I sought this book out because, when discussing historical female badasses, Catherine's name consistently tops the list. It felt downright negligent to not know anything about the (German!) woman who claimed the Russian throne and changed how the rest of the world saw the empire.Born Princess Sophie Friederike Auguste von Anhalt-Zerbst-Dornburg (try saying that 10 times fast), Catherine's mother was quick to try and find a suitable match for her daughter. You see, Catherine's mother wanted to be rich and powerful and, having failed to marry into that herself, she decided to offer up her daughter to the highest (read: richest) bidder. Enter her second cousin, Peter. An emotionally abused child who channeled that negligence into cruelty and petulance, Peter treated Catherine as equal parts playmate, mother, and servant. With Empress Elizabeth still ruling, Peter and Catherine found themselves under the thumb of a increasingly embittered, power consolidating woman. This may be an unfair view of Elizabeth. In fact, a lot of the views of historical figures who weren't Catherine didn't necessarily feel fair in this book. Author Robert Massie seems to be not a little bit infatuated with his subject, and it shows with his heavy narrative of ""Catherine was treated poorly by a lot of people but she was a badass MF and showed them what's what."" While I'm not suggesting the book is historically inaccurate, I do find it curious that Massie takes Catherine at her word in her memoirs, etc. It seems to me she would publicly paint herself in the best light, and, considering how she ruled, I'm skeptical of her being as innocent as she portrays herself before becoming Empress.How did she become Empress? Oh, you know, just overthrowing her husband after a mere 7 months of his ruling.Once she nabs that throne, Catherine outlines sweeping, progressive reforms, most of which get scaled wwaayyy the fuck back (sound familiar? Looks like it's not just democracies that stagnate under the weight of bureaucracy). She did, however, bring Western art and culture to Russia, embracing the teaches of the Enlightenment, even if those teachings didn't extend to the used and abused peasants and serfs in her empire (points to Massie for not shying away from how dirty Catherine did those serfs). Catherine also significantly extended the Russian empire, sending men who adored her to distant lands.Speaking of adoring men, Catherine. Gets. Laid. We always have to read about grossies like King Henry VIII (I mean, they made a friggin' rhyme about him killing off his wives), but we don't read about Catherine banging her way through all these hot, young officers, discarding them after a few years for a newer model? In the 18th century? Get it, girl. Read this, just keep in the back of your mind that Catherine might have been significantly more devious than Massie makes her out to be.

The House of Government was name-dropped in an article I was reading. After skimming a book jacket that promised ""A vivid account of the personal and public lives of Bolshevik true believers... [the] conversion to Communism and... children's loss of faith and the fall of the Soviet Union,"" I was on board, and reserved it from our newly re-opened library. I don't know much about Russian history; now's a good as time as any to learn. My first shock was being handed a book so thick you could easily concuss someone with it. I hadn't looked at the page count, and so wasn't expecting such a magnum opus, despite a comparison to Tolstoy that that same book jacket had made.Then I opened it.The first part was all about geography and societal set-up. It reminded me of Victor Hugo; you want to get to the meat of the story, but he just wants to tell you about flying buttresses for 20 pages. However, I appreciated that Yuri Slezkine wanted to paint a rich picture of the living conditions pre-revolution, so my eyes marched forward.The second part was entirely about religion. I had absolutely 0 interest in this, and blatantly skipped that part.The third part started to get into what I would call ""the good stuff:"" the tsar is overthrown, etc. But Slezkine is writing the driest recounting of history here, and feels the need to provide names and backgrounds for the hundreds of players in the social and political spheres. He also assumes a certain level of background knowledge on the part of his readers, which is laughable when you remember he spent 50 pages on fucking Christianity. I couldn't do it. Life is too damn short. I returned the book to the library.I am positive that this book is a banger for some people. I know, for instance, that the 1K+ paged book The Brontes isn't devoured by others like it was by me. But, unfortunately, I'm just not enough of a Russian history nerd to have the pre-requisites to follow this story, nor do I have the patience to slog through the type of minutia in which Slezkine seems to excel.

Unlike World War Z and The Zombie Survival Guide, Brooks did not have to contend with a veritable library of canon when constructing his furry monsters. For this reason, I had relatively high hopes for this book.Oh well.Devolution is the story of a tiny eco-village, Greenloop, nestled in the wilderness outside of Mount Rainier. After an eruption cuts them off from supplies and escape back to civilization, this small group tries to figure out how to survive. Also, there seems to be something else living in the woods... (ppssst. It's Bigfoot.)My broad issues are as follows: narration, characterization, pace. NarrationThe book is split into 3 lenses, as recounted by a reporter. The first is the reporter's interviews with a park ranger. The second is interviews with Kate's brother. Who is Kate? Well, the last, and the bulk of the book, is the recovered diary of Greenloop resident Kate Holland. There. That's your Kate.Brooks tries very hard to create an environment of urgency, of stress. Which is why the diary format was the absolute wrong choice for this book. The residents of Greenloop are moving at a lightning pace to try and set up gardens and fortify themselves against attacks and Kate (view spoiler)[who becomes their fucking master and commander (hide spoiler)] wastes so much time writing in her goddamn journal. Her husband, Dan, is frantically rewiring their smart houses, and she's just sitting there, journaling away. And, as the tension mounts, and as the threats seemingly become more real, this vision of someone tucking away to journal becomes more ridiculous. (view spoiler)[The part that made me actually groan out loud is toward the climax. Kate's specification in the town has become weapons expert. She is sitting, creating all of these different weapons in the workshop (which is set far away from where everyone else is holed up) when she decides to start journaling. Instead of, you know, making as many weapons as possible. Then, she starts to hear the hooting/grunting of the approaching predators. She journals until they get so loud she realizes it's time to fight and she better get over to the Common House, where everyone else is ANXIOUSLY AWAITING GETTING WEAPONS SO THEY CAN DEFEND THEMSELVES FROM AN ENEMY THAT IS FUCKING AT THEIR GATES. Oh, and when she gets to the Common House THEY'RE ALL ASLEEP. So she was journaling, listening to the predators get closer, all the while her community and her HUSBAND were sleeping, trusting her to wake them in time to get ready?! What the actual fuck. THEN, when it's all over, when everyone is dead except her and Pal, she just... stops? Brooks tries to cover this up with the brother being like ""she stopped writing after the epic battle because it was the end of one chapter and she was beginning a new chapter."" Plot, meet cop-out. Journaling helps with trauma, that's the reason Kate is keeping a journal to begin with, because her therapist told her it would help with the sussing out of things. Then, when she experiences real, horrifying trauma, she gives up the pen? Maybe it's because the horrifying trauma is partially the journal's fault?! Nah, Kate is too dumb for that. It's because Brooks picked a stupid narration form and had to stop somewhere (hide spoiler)]. I'm going to make it about me for a second. I am a regular journaler. I've been journaling since I was in grade school. And guess what? When shit is going down? I do not journal. When I'm camping with my husband? I don't sit there and journal away while he constructs our shelter and makes us food. I'm there working with him. The idea that someone who is racing against the clocks of winter and predators would sit down and journal constantly is fucking stupid. She mentions so many times that she's not sleeping. (view spoiler)[ This lack of sleep even results in REINHARDT'S MURDER (hide spoiler)]. Yet, she spends hours (considering the length of her journal entries) writing. Like, no. CharacterizationKate, the main character, is utterly unlikable. Mostly because of the whole ""I'm gonna sit here and journal while everyone else is running around,"" but also for the waffling in her characterization. She is equal parts the leader, and the stupidest fucking person to ever exist. (view spoiler)[ She knows how deadly the predators are, and yet SHE GOES UP INTO THE WOODS ALONE. What?! She knows they're attracted to movement and light, yet she INSISTS ON WATCHING EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS THROUGH THE WINDOWS. She becomes the weapons expert, BUT ONLY AFTER MOSTAR SAVES HER LIFE FROM HER OWN STUPIDITY AND INSISTS THAT SHE LEARN. Also, that learning happened, what, a day before the final battle? Bitch, please.  (hide spoiler)]. Also, why does she have to know the calories in everything/be workout and body obsessed? I am a healthy woman, who works out daily. I do not know the calories of everything. I could just be petty at this point, but this felt goddamn sexist to me. Mostar, the real hero of the story, is strong, capable, calculating. Yet, for some reason, she insists on helping the stupidest fucking person to ever exist, Kate. (view spoiler)[ I think Brooks was trying to suggest that Mostar saw her lost daughter in Kate. But we'll never know, because he chose the fucking diary route of narration. Another thing that really, really bothered me is that Kate is objectively stupid, yet it was Kate who realized she could use the 3D printer to fabricate weapons. No. Mostar would have figured that out after Day 1. How dare you do Mostar like that, Brooks (hide spoiler)]. The diary narration does not allow us to learn much about Mostar, and Kate doesn't bother to try and learn anything about the person single-handedly saving her, because she doesn't care (she actually says that multiple times in her journal. That it seems like Mostar wants to tell her about her past, but Kate doesn't want to ask, so doesn't, and so Mostar doesn't say anything). Mostar is a great character. Too bad Brooks didn't bother to do anything with her.The community of Greenloop was created by a couple, known collectively as the Durants. And they make NO SENSE AT ALL. (view spoiler)[The first day after the eruption they do some brief recon and then... hide in their house? One of them slowly decomposing in his own filth and the other perpetually working out on the elliptical? Like... what? Also, the fact that everyone is pooling their resources and battening down the hatches, yet they don't bang down the Durants door to demand supplies/their assistance? That's fucking stupid. Only when shit is getting really bad do they go, and only then to try and protect the couple. No one is that altruistic. Brooks spends so much of the book laying out how we're all animals and how we're all capable of ""devolution"" if the situation warrants it. Yet they just let the Durants be while they're restricting calories and fortifying a barracks. Right. Whatever.  (hide spoiler)]PaceI think Brooks just didn't have enough material in his brain, which is why the pace is as follows: here we are in this new community OH NO ERUPTION OH NO THE WOODS OH NO OH NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. He doesn't spend much time at all fleshing out his characters. Not even Kate, whose diary we're reading. All I know about her is that she didn't really like her husband and she counts calories and she has anxiety. Wow. Way to go. There was very little fleshing out of the environment. And this is definitely not a ""slow burn"" horror. We get one nice dinner and then it's BOOM BANG BRAINS AGAINST THE PAVEMENT. I say I have a problem with the pace, but as I write this I realize there isn't really a pace to have a problem with.

Pip is quintessential young-man-growing-up: thinks he's entitled to everything, doesn't realize what an ass he's being, follows his fancies rather than acknowledging reality. And he gets kicked in the butt for it again and again. It's a great read. You love to hate Pip. You feel kind of bad for him because he's just a bumbling kid, but you still love it. Sure, the book is written as a retrospective, and you can feel the remorse of current-day-narrator-Pip as he recounts his youthful foibles. But, like, screw you Pip.Similarly, Ms. Havisham and Estella are mustache-twirling-ly cruel. I hated them too, and enjoyed every minute of that hating. Sometimes books have a swath of unlikable characters and it's exhausting to read. But Dickens has somehow managed to cram a bunch of assholes between his pages and you can't help but continue to turn the page. Post Script: I own an old/random edition of this book (it doesn't have a publishing date, and was clearly written on a typewriter. Thank you estate sales), which contains both endings Dickens wrote: his original ending, and then the initially publicized ending (a friend of his suggested he not go with the original, because it was too dark). Unsurprisingly, the original ending is much better than the originally publicized and far more optimistic ending.

Did I, actually, dislike it? You tell me.In the Woods is a first person narration; a story told by Adam Robert Ryan (he goes by Rob, now, thanks), a murder detective in Dublin. A young girl is murdered in the rural town of Knocknaree, and Rob and his partner Cassie are on the case. But, of all things, Rob grew up in Knocknaree. What's more: when he was 12 he and his two best friends disappeared into the woods one day, and Rob was the only child seen again. The reader watches as thwaw two plots twist and weave between one another. Is there something supernatural at play? Are the old disappearances and this new murder connected? Will the return of the prodigal son (Rob) uncover secrets left dormant for decades? French's writing style keeps you turning those pages. She's written a rich landscape with dozens of characters. Most whodunnits are very dialogue and plot-point heavy. But French's prose elevate the detective genre to something I didn't realize I wanted it to be.But, listen, I wanted to know what happened to the present-day (2007) young girl, sure, but far, far more intriguing was what happened twenty years ago: how did Rob's two friends just disappear? Why were his shoes, when he was found back then, filled with someone else's blood? Why were there three large rips in the back of his shirt? This was the really interesting thread of the book, in my opinion. 1984 captured my interest far more than 2007. That's not to knock the 2007 plot. I didn't see the reveal(s) coming, which is always welcome, and those aforementioned dozens of characters are well fleshed-out. These days, whodunnits have, like, three central characters, and you're like ""well, shit, okay, it's one of these three, clearly. Way to narrow it down."" But French has a veritable amphitheater full of potential murderers. To that I say: bravo.But now we get to the bit that sets my teeth on edge. The main character? Rob Ryan? Suuuccckkksss. He's the goddamn worst. He's sexist, for one. Every woman he meets he wants pull to himself and shelter them from the storms of life. Like, listen dude. We're not all delicate flowers who need a man to protect us. Including his own partner! The badass, totally independent Cassie. He's supposed to know her, they're best friends, but he can't see beyond her boobs. And, for him, boobs = needs a man as a buffer for this cruel, cruel world. French is a woman, so I assume she wrote Rob like this intentionally, but it made me so angry I sometimes had to put the book down in disgust. Also, Rob is objectively terrible at his job, which was also really difficult to read. The number of times he compromises the investigation or does something borderline illegal is enough to drive a reader insane. Again, this has to be intentional, but it was exhausting to be trapped with a frustrating narrator with no redeemable qualities and a shitty attitude for 400 pages. TL/DR: The prose are beautiful, it's a well-written and surprising whodunnit, but the main character is a shitbird of a person from whom you walk away with vehement hate.There is one other thing that monumentally annoyed me, but it spoils everything, so... you've been warned.(view spoiler)[As I previously mentioned, I was far more invested in the 1984 disappearances. Was it truly something supernatural? Did the religious import of the wood result in some sort of swallowing of Jamie and Peter back then? Was it a deranged teenager? Or maybe just your run-of-the-mill serial killer/pedophile? Well, we'll never know, because French writes it all away by having Rob Ryan state he'll never remember what happened that day, and that all the evidence is degraded/the detectives on that case let it go/no one cares. Well, I care! I had to hop onto Wikipedia to see if the disappearances ever crop up in her other books, but they don't, and I am sorely disappointed. I'm almost certain I know why French didn't tie up this thread. Like most monster reveals, the truth is so much less sensational than the fear and anticipation of the unknown. French decided that leaving Jamie and Peter as a question mark would spare her the risk of writing a shitty/boring/contrived ending. But I hate that, and it made me mad, and so here we are at three stars.

He meanders around this central topic, dropping asides, going down rabbit holes only to lose interest and go ""next!"" I could see how reading him might be frustrating, but it only piques my interest in certain topics more, resulting in further research and reading up on the microtopics he briefly introduces. Only in a Ronson book will you read about the porn industry and then immediately swivel to internet reputation businesses and then swivel to prison systems and then to a woman who made a bad joke on Twitter. Maybe this isn't his intent: to make us curious and do our own research, but I'd rather no one tell me if his writing style is purely due to ADD.In So You've Been Publicly Shamed Ronson begins with his own shame: a Twitter bot using his face and name, tweeting out random crap about food and porn. From there, he wonders about the concept of shame in the first place, launching the reader into several stories of reputations taken down by the masses of the internet. A corporation shamed on Twitter after doing something reprehensible can be a force for good; that same shaming culture causing someone to lose their livelihood over a bad joke? Maybe not so much. Ronson suggests that maybe we think before we heap judgment onto others; before we allow our legal systems to use shame as punishment. In an age of instant gratification, maybe just, like, stop a sec.For me, the most interesting portion of this book centered around profound shaming in childhood (read: shame as abuse), and how that plays out in crime once that individual has grown. The trope of the picked-on kid having a hit list in adulthood is worn out, sure, but it exists for a reason. The fact that shaming plays out in courts and in prisons? Is that really helping us?Who and how we shame has the potential to shape our society.

That is: easy-to-digest fluff that didn't make me feel much of anything, in a world where I'm feeling a bit too much a bit too often.General premise is a standard trope: cool, poor, single mom and her quiet daughter move into an upper crust neighborhood, presumably for good, after 15+ years on the road. The daughter falls in with a rich family (read: rich boy has crush), and drama between said families ensues. Little Fires Everywhere is a perfectly passable way to spend some time, but a good novel it is not. The characters are not well-developed. Who is Mrs. Richardson, really? We get the briefest of glimpses into her formative years, but it is very clear author Celeste Ng had a richer idea of the character in her head, and just chose not to share that version with us. Mia is a walking GD contradiction. Self-sabatoging but with a heart a gold, but that heart really only shines for people who are not her daughter? She could provide appropriately for her daughter, but chooses not to because, well, it's not really clear why. For ""her art,"" I guess. Whatever. Dude, I hated Mia. Mia's quiet daughter, Pearl, is a cardboard cut-out character. No depth whatsoever, and, honestly the same could be said for the 4 Richardson children. Even Izzy, the precocious black sheep, has no real substance, there is no real unpacking as to why she is the way that she is, and at the close of the book I was just kinda like ""uuh... well.. okay then I guess?""The conflicts are boring. I mean, Ng gets credit for bringing abortion to the stage. Even in 2020 people are still scared to talk about abortion (don't even get me started with the 2016 Gilmore Girls revival. Rory. You can terminate this pregnancy). But even that aspect of the book felt more like a device to get to what Ng thought was a ""better"" conflict (it wasn't), and the direct fallout from that decision was only vaguely touched upon. The other conflicts: a hidden past, a King Solomon dilemma, a forbidden love, were yawn-tastic.The book just isn't well-written. This borders on being mean for the sake of it, but Ng doesn't provide lush detail in her prose, yet fails to provide the snappy/blunt dialogue of a Hemingway. So, yea, blase at best.All-in-all, if you're looking for something to shut your brain off, this is definitely it. You can read this after downing a bottle of wine and not miss much in the way of important plot points or beautiful language. Cause, you know, there is none.Spoiler bone-to-pick below.(view spoiler)[Yea, so, the thing I disliked most about this book was the ""conflict"" between Linda and Mark Mccullough, and Bebe. Apparently this is a hot button thing, and, based on the length of time Ng spent on this secondary plot, something Ng probably watched play out in real life. But for me I was just sitting there like ""yo, she's not a fit mother, clearly, and she abandoned her baby. What selfish woman would do a take-backsy and choose a life of poverty and uncertainty and fear for their child over comfort and security?"" This might be my social deviance showing, but it just seemed so clear cut: The Mcculloughs should have the baby, and Bebe sucks. I had a neighbor who fostered kids - kids who had been malnourished and lived in fear before arriving at my neighbor's door. When their bio mom would come around it was awful on so many levels. Those children deserved safety. All children deserve safety. People should think twice about having kids if they cannot provide that safety. Do you know what it's like to have to go over expenses with your mother when you're 12yrs old and worry about food? It's not fair and- holy shit, okay, we're unpacking my stuff now. Best leave that for the therapist. So much for not feeling much of anything. But, yea, fuck Bebe.

I didn't like it enough, however, to ever plan to read another installment, despite the massive cliff hanger it ended on. Author Brandon Sanderson has created a fantasy world all its own in his Stormlight Archive series. From what we can see in this first installment, Sanderson's world is populated by several races of humans, fighting one another as well as fighting their natural environment. They are also ravaged by what they call High Storms - crazy wind/rain storms that can kill a man left out alone. A man, you say? Not women? We'll get to Sanderson's women in due time.Book #1 here primarily focuses on:Kaladin: a warrior-turned-slaveDalinar: brother of a king, who is all into war and shit... or is he?Shallan: a young woman, looking to become a scholar... maybeKaladin takes up the lion share of the narrative. He spends much of the book on ""The Shattered Plains,"" a cracked, desert-esque landscape, where two races of people are fighting over ""gemhearts,"" actual hearts they cut out of creatures. It's gross... and kind of stupid. We watch Kaladin as he struggles with his Lawful Good personality. The sheer amount of times he goes ""No!!!!!!!!!"" is distracting. We get it, man, you're living through war. But, this is why Lawful Good isn't a popular choice when creating a D&D character. It's boring. It's exhausting. Kaladin doesn't think logically, he thinks along the lines of some random, masculine honor code he cooked up, that really only makes sense to him. He is supposed to be our hero, and I hate him.One of the many reasons I hate Kaladin, is because much of Sanderson's race structure is filtered through him. To call the characters in this book racist is an understatement. These characters are goddamn bigots. I started taking screenshots of particular fucked up passages, just to keep it all straight. Take the following, where Kaladin meets a parshman, one of the more abused races in the book:He glanced over his shoulder at the parshman. He was a little taller than most, his face a little wider, but they all looked about the same to Kaladin.They also start to straight up torture that same parshman later, but I won't bore you with how horrifying that was. Oh, and did I mention that parshman have skin of black with red marbling? Right.There's also this whole lighteyes vs. darkeyes thing that... I mean... why? Can you guess which is inferior?While we're talking about Kaladin, let's mention the battles scenes. There are dozens. They are long winded. They are boring. It's interesting, because even though one warrior in this book becomes increasingly repulsed by war, Sanderson seems to revel in it. This book did not need to be as long as it was. I started skimming the battle passages early on. So let's skip over to Shallan: the main, and one of only three fleshed out female characters in, again a 1,200+ page novel. Shallan is a young girl who pursues a wardship under Jasnah, a scholar and relatively badass woman (the third and final woman is royal matriarch Navani, who is really only there to try and bang Dalinar). Shallan is vapid and mostly thinks about marriage and drawing, so we're not really going to talk about her. Instead, we're going to talk about Jasnah. Jasnah is not religious, she is brilliant, she is a magic wielder. But, because she is Woman, her pursuits and intelligence are mostly filtered through how she interacts with male scholars and with her uncle, Dalinar. What's more, at one point Jasnah purposely goes out and confronts these 4 murderer guys, and all Shallan can think about is how Jasnah, by going to confront them, was asking to be murdered. That's right, everyone. Shallan is all you can't just go and confront bad guys and not expect them to try and murder you. That's just asking for it. Fuck the fuck off, Sanderson. If you were trying to draw this rape parallel to achieve something meaningful, you failed. This utterly offended me.Speaking of offending me, for reasons we won't get into Shallan finds herself with a mortal wound on her arm at one point. She's ultimately fine, but everyone thinks she did it on purpose... to commit suicide over a guy. They actually joke about it in front of her. The guy in question visits her at her sick bed with treats and Jasnah makes fun of him by saying: ""I'm sorry I drove you to suicide. Here's some bread."" Again, Sanderson, if you were trying to say something meaningful about how women are perceived, etc., you didn't. Despite how exhaustive you are about battles, you drop shit like this without unpacking it at all. Sanderson leaves hints throughout the book that maybe the bigotry and sexism will ultimately be turned on its head in this series. Dalinar's growing disillusionment with war is probably going to result in some sort of crazy revelation 5 books down the line, and Sanderson has already dropped hints in book #1 here that maybe lighteyes are not inherently better than darkeyes... but who wants to read tens of thousands of pages of racist bullshit just to find out in the end that racism is bad, mmk?I am so sick and tired of fantasy using the medieval model for their story telling. It is FANTASY. It could be ANYTHING. To always go back to women in subservient roles (in this series, women have to hide a hand, called a ""safehand,"" at all times.

A disjointed timeline (my favorite) Daniel Kehlmann takes the reader on a journey through Tyll's life, beginning in the prime of his performing years, bouncing back to his childhood, then toward the end of his journey, and there and back again. I want everyone to read this book, if for nothing else than as a study in translation. Ross Benjamin manages to retain the lyricism of the text, despite having to take the original grammar and completely flip it and reverse it. The translations of German to English I had to do in college were clunky at best. Benjamin reminds us what a nuanced and difficult job translation can be, and the magic it brings when done correctly.Tyll is a man, brought up the son of a poor miller with a curious mind, who goes on an adventure rather than see his fate out in anonymity. Through a serious of seemingly random occurrences, in different shades of malevolent, Tyll grows and learns the tricks of the performer trade, and of living on one's own in the forests and streets. There is witchcraft, religion, science, royalty; there are made up and historical figures interacting and arguing; there are prose in praise of nature, and prose in warning of the cruelty of humans.What I really want to talk to you about, though, are the death scenes. There are many, and they are beautiful. There is the person who is executed, the person who slips away in old age, but the shining star of Tyll is the character who becomes ill and, feverishly, comes in and out of consciousness, trying to make sense of what is happening. I will leave you with a sample, in hopes it will convince you to go out and buy this book. You know, when we're allowed out of our homes. He heard the choir and thought of the fairy tale about the spindle that his mother had once told him.

To capture that feeling on paper? Is nothing short of remarkable. James Baldwin brought this manuscript to publisher Knopf, and Knopf told him to burn the book rather than actually allow it to come to life. They advised that the book would ruin him, and attempted, in the way only Big Publishing can, to silence him.Well, Baldwin published Giovanni's Room anyway, and we are all better for it, though, also, devastated.Because, truly, if I had to pick one work to describe Giovanni's Room, it would be ""devastating."" Baldwin perfectly captures the suicidal ideation; the self-deprecation and hatred that society forces on a person who is considered Other. Giovanni's Room follows David, a (white) American living in Paris, as he reflects on his life and his choices one significant night in his tiny, dirty European apartment. He internally recounts his childhood, his relationships, and Giovanni, the man who awakened in him everything he fought to keep asleep. The reader bounces from present-day David, thinking on the past and unraveling, ever so slightly, to past-David, traipsing through Paris and trying to balance who he should be and what makes him happy. One can feel the poignant internal struggle in Baldwin himself, to accept himself, even if the rest of the world had not yet realized that who one loves does not define their character. It's heartbreaking, and a reminder that, even all these years later, we still have so much more to learn about love and acceptance. Favorite quote:People who believe that they are strong-willed and the masters of their destiny can only continue to believe this by becoming specialists in self-deception.

What I'm trying to say is: the science Malcolm Gladwell covers isn't new ground for me. However, his thesis is wildly important for all of us to think on. Malcolm Gladwell is a behemoth in the nonfiction world. He's spent the past 20+ years writing about how and why humans think, act, and interact the way that they do. In Talking to Strangers, Galdwell attempts to unpack how we cooperate and deceive one another, and what this says about the framework of modern day trust in our society. The reader dips into vignettes about Adolf Hitler, Fidel Castro, Bernie Madoff, and Slyiva Plath, to name a few. He unpacks how inept our lawyers and law enforcement officers are at picking out liars and truth-tellers, and how physical presentations of anxiety, deception, etc. are just constructs, and do not actually tell us the underlying truth of any given person. He touches on suicide as opportunity (which was, in my opinion, the most fascinating part of the book); what constitutes consciousness and consent; and how we regularly, daily, misunderstand one another. There are some really tough parts of this book. Gladwell covers the Sandra Bland case, as well as the case of sexual assault against Brock Turner. These stories are not for the weak-stomached, but they represent important ground as one unpacks the human social experience. While not a groundbreaking book, I'd honestly love to see it taught in high schools. Talking to Strangers is a critical eye on how we relate to and interact with strangers and intimates alike, and where our society might be headed if we don't pull up and re-examine ourselves and how we treat and interpret others. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Feb 11, 2020","Feb 19, 2020","Feb 11, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43848929-talking-to-strangers

It's inevitable that it would be a bit of slogYou're not wrong. But just this summer I read Robert Massie's 625 page Catherine the Great and positively ripped through it. Juliet Barker's The Brontes is an intimidating 1003 pages, and I was almost sad when it ended. All this defending to say: I am no stranger to the verbose biography. But this was... just... look, I don't want to say that it was painful. But bits of this book weren't not painful.I picked up this book because Virginia Woolf has written, to me, the most tragic, most beautiful, and most layered prose. Period. Every single book of hers makes me cry, and I can't  any of her books without quoting extensively from them. That said, I knew very, very little about Virginia Woolf the person, save her suicide note and that she put rocks in her pockets and walked into a lake or something.**it was actually one rock and she threw herself into a river.A tiny gripe about this book is that it is NOT linear most of the time. The first chapter just explains the houses Virginia Woolf lived in. Chapters like ""Madness"" - where Lee bops around about all of Virginia's different breakdowns; and ""Abuses"" - where Lee talks about Virginia's half brothers and the sexual assault she likely suffered by their hands, squiggle all over Virginia's timeline. Not only is this jarring, but it also means that this book repeats itself at times. Not cute for a book as big as this one. My #1 gripe, however, is that this book is both wildly granular, and yet still held Virginia Woolf at arms length. Walking away from this book I know so much I didn't need to know, but feel as though I was never able to really peer behind the curtain of Virginia Woolf the person.Lee spent an entire chapter going over Leonard's (Virginia's husband) various investments and the financial yield they provided the household. Why? Why was this necessary? There was also an entire chapter on the printing press Virginia and Leonard owned. I'm talking make, model, how it worked. WHY, LEE, WHY?!Yet, despite that level of detail, and despite the public nature of Virginia Woolf's diaries, the letters between herself and her friends, and letters between her friends and other friends ABOUT her, Lee shied away from really unpacking Virginia. Her sexual relationships with women, and how she felt about herself and her place in the world are still totally foreign to me after reading this book. Virginia Woolf was an anxious, neurotic, slightly racist, slightly classist genius, who survived several breakdowns until one ultimately got the best of her. That's all I really took away from this experience. More about those takeaways though:Racism: the Dreadnought hoax. Classism: I honestly don't want to go into it, but basically she hated everyone who worked for her and called them horrible things for no reason. Even the woman who worked for her with whom was likely sleeping was not immune to her sharp tongue.Familial relationships: Virginia was creepily close with her sister Vanessa, and with Vanessa's children... especially the daughter Angelica. This comes across VERY clearly even in a narrative like Lee's, where it sometimes feels like she's watching Virginia through the wrong end of the telescope. So that was... kinda gross. At this point I feel about Virginia Woolf the way I feel about Tom Cruise: I love their work, but they're objectively shitty people.Don't meet your heroes and all that.Look, Hermione Lee deserves major kudos for her work. Writing a biography on Virginia Woolf was undoubtedly a massive, and sometimes frustrating, undertaking. Because of this, it seems as though Lee got in her own way a bit, and got too bogged down in insignificant details (say, the make and model of Virginia's printing press), which obscured what this book was really supposed to be about. I commend Lee, but I was relieved when I turned the final page. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Mar 16, 2021","Apr 19, 2021","Jan 17, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18846.Virginia_Woolf

I feel this deeply, because this was me. I did so much work for NYC publishing houses FOR FREE in my early 20s, because they made me feel like I had to, because they had this bizarre pay-your-dues mentality. They made me think if I worked my for-money job and then did free work for them at night, eventually they'd pay me $25K (with no benefits) to be able to not afford NYC. And I was excited about that! That is, until I realized I needed to, you know, eat and make rent. ENOUGH ABOUT ME. Wiener had that same realization: food and shelter are kinda great, and so she jumped ship and moved onto an e-book start-up. From there, she bopped around to a couple of different start-ups, moved to San Francisco, and struggled with whether she ""belonged"" in a sea of male computer science majors.I'm not going to undercut the importance of a book like this existing. While it's a poorly kept secret that Silicon Valley has a gender gap even Gandalf couldn't make his way out of, having a book by a woman who actually worked within that gap can help move it back into conversations. This could maybe, just maybe, help to ultimately mitigate all that inequality bullshit. However, Wiener's writing just... it isn't great, man. It reads like a freshman seminar essay. You know the kind: their High School English teacher encouraged them write, so they think they're the next Faulkner and just dump all their thoughts onto a page. The result is garbled rambling. You, the overworked, underpaid TA, have to liberally exercise your red pen and crush their dreams: they're not Faulkner; they're just a mediocre writer like the majority of us. I would get bored reading another Wiener description of a to-go lunch, of another string of emojis popping up in the company's group chat, and then I'd realize that I had turned 3 pages without remembering anything. Her writing just isn't compelling; her lens isn't unique.In those same freshman seminars, one of the first things that poor TA says is: ""ask yourself: does this need to be written? And am I the one to write it?"" In this case, this book does need to be written, but by someone else.

Wildly clever thing, that Derry Girls. Take the trope of a bunch of young women coming-of-age, going to high school, shenanigans with nuns, then fold it into the violence and fear and uncertainty of all of thing happening in the 1990s when The Troubles were still very much a thing. So, Patrick Radden Keefe's Say Nothing was published at the exact right moment, when people were already talking about this particular bit of history, and realizing how little the broader public knows.Keefe researched the ever-loving shit out of this book. Seriously. The notes at the back end take up roughly 100 pages. He begins with a brief history of Protestant vs. Catholic; loyalist vs. republican, then focuses on the hot beds of the 1970s - early 2000s. After that, he even takes the reader up to 2018; it feels like he likely researched this book up to the day he finished writing. It's that contemporary, it's that well researched.Then what the fuck, B, you might be saying. You gave this book 3 stars. What, ya running out or something?No. I have one giant complaint about this book, and it might not be fair, but it is the reason I took so long to finish the book.Because of the scope of this conflict, Keefe introduces dozens and dozens of people as the book goes on. Sometimes you meet someone, they disappear for 80 pages, and then come back. However, because of the saturation of names in Say Nothing, it was nearly impossible to keep everyone straight. I wish Keefe had begun each chapter with a sort of spider-ing graphic of who the players were going to be in that chapter, and how they related to the primary characters of Jean McConville (one of the Disappeared), Brendan Hughes (IRA), Gerry Adams (IRA), and Dolours Price (IRA). I kept getting confused, flipping through the book, checking up on Wikipedia, and, in some cases, just rolling my eyes and giving up, accepting that I just wasn't going to ever understand how this puzzle piece fit into the broader tapestry. I acknowledge that this might not be fair. Keefe is taking on a colossal undertaking with this book, and he did do a great job. But, like many nonfictions, Say Nothing sometimes gets mired in the details. The need for accuracy detracts from narrative. A good thing for a journalist, but a cumbersome thing for a reader. This book is definitely worth a read, for the information you'll get out of it alone. However, maybe keep a notebook next to you.

Where the Crawdads Sing could have been a drag to read if it had simply followed the deep ruts books before it had made. However, Delia Owens achieves enough originality and depth of character to sidestep tedium and come out with an entertaining, if relatively predictable, story.The reader needs to suspend a bit of disbelief within these pages. We meet main character Kya at ~6yrs old, as her mother abandons her family of 5 children with their alcoholic, abusive father. Following this abandonment, each sibling systematically leaves the home, leaving their helpless youngest sibling, Kya, to fend for herself (this was incredibly hard for me to read. I could have NEVER left my brothers when they were tiny bbs. But I do know these things happen. See Educated, amirite?). Anyway, the alcoholic father ultimately disappears, so Kya has to figure out how to keep the house up and eat regularly and just generally survive. She lives in a shack in North Carolina marshes, and the townsfolk judge such people as subhuman. However, the idea that not a single person would attempt to take in a clearly abandoned small child is sort of unbelievable. Owens briefly talks about racism and classicism in her book (the timeline of which spans, for the most part, from 1952-1970), but Kya is white, and is coming into town as a barefoot, starving, beautiful child. It's difficult for me to fully buy into the idea that no one, save for a dock worker called ""Jumpin'"" and his wife Mabel, provide any assistance, preferring for this little kid to perish in the elements and the wilds.Moving on. Kya grows up on her lonesome, uneducated, illiterate, the seagulls she wastes precious food on as her only ""family."" But then a fellow kid takes an interest in her, a friendship forms, and she becomes more socially acceptable. As she ages and gets mega-hot, she catches the eye of football star/total D-bag Chase, who wakes up dead one morning in 1969 and, whoopsie! the town thinks it's gotta be Kya, The Marsh Girl (now 24yrs old).There's not much more to say about the plot without giving things away. If you're reading this and thinking ""what do you mean she becomes more socially acceptable?"" I mean this bitch learns to read, learns the Latin words for everything around her, becomes smarter than most of the people she interacts with in town. Unlikely? You're telling me. But the reader spends so much time in Kya's head as she navigates profound loneliness, that you want her to be a genius, so you forgive Owens for the fantastical nature of her protagonist. I've been sassy up until this point, and it might seem like I didn't enjoy this book. But I really did: the way that I enjoy listening to the Top 100 radio station or sitting down with my sister-in-law to watch reality television. It's not my cup of tea all the time, but sometimes there's a gem in the fluff, one that's truly engaging. Kya, despite the unsubstantiated genius stuff, is beautifully written. Tragic, curious, longing, she effortlessly pulls at your heart strings. Her internal struggles with childhood friend Tate and with D-bag Chase are relateable for anyone who has been in love, and can leave the reader breathless with hope and sadness. Do I wish Owens stopped talking about how gorgeous Kya was? Yea. Stop objectifying your main character, and we don't need a blow-by-blow of what she wore every day. And if I had to read the phrase ""her first instinct was to run/hide"" one more time, I was going to go bananas. But Where the Crawdads Sing was still compulsively readable and satisfying.

I see similar flaws in both, and my hatred of the show I began reading this in tandem with the television show, which maybe wasn't the wisest choice. I see similar flaws in both, and my hatred of the show leaked out and made me more critical of the book than maybe I would have been, had BBC and HBO not bastardized something I love so completely. The Secret Commonwealth picks up with Lyra when she is 20 years old. It's been almost a decade since we saw her last, and the trauma of her childhood journey to the north and everything that followed is something she is still unpacking. She goes to university, but retains a space at Jordan College, where she continues on with professor Malcom Polstead, the housemaid Alice, and Hannah, the alethiometer teacher. At the beginning of the book we witness a murder, and that murder, coupled with nebulous prophecy stuff that is still tailing Lyra, leads her to run away (again) to search for answers (again); this time, with PTSD! It is written as the first of two parts, so many plot points are purposely left unanswered. So, in lieu of walking us down the line of the plot, plot, plot of this book, I'm going to instead tell you all of the things I didn't like. WARNING: this means minor spoilers, but nothing that you don't realize/aren't told early on in this 600+ page book. Malcolm didn't show up in the original trilogy, but we are told in The Secret Commonwealth that he had taught Lyra at Jordan College, after he had completed his studies. We know from The Book of Dust that he was the ~10yr old boy who ferried infant Lyra to safety. To reiterate: Malcolm took care of Lyra when she was a baby: diaper changing, the whole 9 yards. Then he stayed on at Jordan College and watched her grow up. Taught a 9yr old precocious child when he was ~19. So it is extra disgusting that he is now in love with her. Repugnant, skin crawlingly gross. Like... why, Pullman? Why???The explanation for Lyra's strained relationship with Pan is very, very thin. Pullman tells us it's due to Pan being left on the shores of The Land of the Dead, but they both knew that it was something she had to do, and they had still loved each other at the close of The Amber Spyglass. What changed between then and now? And, what's more, Pan is Lyra. So does she, like, hate herself? Why isn't that explored then in this book? Lyra curses at Pan they ignore each other... it's totally out of character and very disturbing if you remember that implications from the original trilogy. I'm not sure Pullman does remember. He's changed what the daemon/human relationship is, and not for the better. Word to the wise: don't fuck with canon.Speaking of things not explored - this book is just BOOM plot device BOOM plot device, hurtling pell mell into the next conflict, without any real reflection or narrative weave; something Pullman was so good at in the original trilogy. He also introduces WAY too many characters... it took until halfway through the book for me to adequately keep all the secondary characters straight in my head. Condense, man. You don't need that many characters, and you don't need to have so many dramatic things happening. Pick a few conflicts for fuckssake.In contrast, something that is explored far too thoroughly is how all the males in the book want to bang Lyra. Men leer at her, there's a goddamn rape attempt... pretty much every male character makes some internal comment about her looks. It's really, really unnecessary, and was uncomfortable to read. This discomfort was not a ""wow, the author made me really think about the objectification of women"" thing, but rather a ""wow, I think the old man author wants to bang his 20yr old fictional creation"" thing. Yeech. Also, you didn't need to mention her period, man. Just... don't.The refugee crisis stuff felt forced and weird and, again unnecessary. Maybe it's another lead up to the third book, but you can't have 600+ pages of nothing but filler. Why even bring this conflict in?Writing this  actually caused me to dock a star, down from 3 to 2. It's the nostalgia that makes me apologetic, but, looking back at The Secret Commonwealth, there really wasn't anything I liked about the book. Lyra utterly ignores the alethiometer, because she's ""forgotten"" how to read it. That's never unpacked, and it's really annoying. Is this meant to be an overarching allegory for how we lose our sense of wonder and imagination when we become adults? If so, it was done very clumsily. I've always adored Philip Pullman, and I have no idea what has happened, but it hurts me. To take a beloved character like Lyra and strip her down to depressed hot chick who is floundering around is a goddamn disgrace. STOP REVISITING THINGS THAT WERE GOOD AS THEY WERE.

Their album ""So Jealous"" came out in 2004, the year I turned 16, the year I openly dated a girl in high school, the year I began to settle into the idea of being queer and began to permanently shedding the strict Christian household I had grown up in. It was the year I began to accept that I didn't have to hate myself and that I could find happiness in just being me. I had a long road to walk, and I definitely backslid into self-loathing multiple times over the years, but ""So Jealous"" was, in a lot of ways, a sort of background track to the struggle it was to find and accept myself.High School documents Tegan and Sara's Grade 10 - Grade 12. A three year period where they discovered drugs, guitar playing, and began to discover themselves. Despite the decades that separate the writers from the content, the book reads with the same desperate anger and hope that defines high school for so many people. Reading about sleepovers with the girl who is your friend... but who you also kiss once the lights go out, and the roiling in your belly that comes with that, shot me back to my own experiences, my own fear, my own pushed limits. They write with an open honesty that is so rare in memoirs. They are aware they made mistakes, that they were sometimes unfair to the people they cared about, and they pour all of that into their writing, as though they were in fact still in high school and confessing to a diary rather than to their editor. High School doesn't shy away from the darker and uglier parts of growing up. Tegan and Sara go back and forth, each writing a chapter. They write clearly and objectively about how cruel teenagers can be to their family and to their friends. What's more: they're honest about finding footing with each other, the huge fights they had, and the scars they still carry from being so close to each other during their formative years. Having a sibling is hard enough, being a twin brings to the table a unique set of conflicts.Read this book.

Lear is sizing up his daughters, and makes the mistake of putting his eggs in selfish baskets. The message seems to be: children can be greedy little shits when they see their parents getting older. They smell blood in the water. To double up on this sentiment, we get the parallel story of Lear's buddy, Gloucester. Gloucester has two sons: one legitimate, one less-than-legitimate (though he loves the latter equally). The less-than-legitimate son (let's just call him a bastard, eh? It's fitting) is all concerned about his inheritance. So he decides to poison his father against his brother.Maybe it's because I'm watching my mother and her sister battle it out over THEIR mother's assets while that poor woman is still alive, but I really, really loved this play. The greed, the madness, the regret, the loss of control. It was masterful. It was beautiful. Brava.Reading this after The Year of Lear was particularly great, because of all the juicy background I had on the play. Plus, the library edition of King Lear provided both the 1608 Quarto and the 1623 Folio. It was fascinating to flip between the two, comparing the different the endings. Personally, I find the 1608 version superior. Having Lear speak the line: Break, heart, I prithee, break! was positively wrenching.PS.

Then he switched from Netflix to the news, saw our real government putting real kids in cages, and was like ""fuck it, I'm going live."" I thought this immediate revelation would cheapen the book for me, make it feel formulaic and contrived and too on the nose re: the current political climate. But it wasn't that (though King lets you know time and time again how much he hates Trump. Which, like, good. I hate him too). Even more impressive, however, is that King did not go off the rails in this book. It's a goddamn miracle: the plot was actually pretty tight. He speaks to the laziness that comes with complacency, how the notion of infallibility can be the downfall of even the biggest machines, and how we don't often see the trees for the forest (ie taking a bonafide genius to your broken down Institute because you're Too Big To Fail. Again. You'd think it'd be too on the nose. But it ain't). Plus, Owen wasn't involved so there wasn't a JK LOL IT'S JUST ALIENS thing at the end... or at least... not until a sequel is written. King writes children well. The precociousness; the innocence coupled with random bursts of wisdom far exceeding years. He nails the fact that children are always listening, even if you think they aren't/think they couldn't possibly understand. The Institute primarily follows Luke Ellis, a 12yr old who is an actual, bonafide genius. He is also a little telekinetic, which results in his involuntary residence at, you guessed it, the Institute. There Luke makes friends with fellow residents: spirited Kalisha, dissenting Nick, jokester George, and Avery, a very young, very gifted telepath. The adults within the Institute are cartoon-mustache-twirling-ly evil, which almost feels unbelievable at times. That being said, King seems to want to highlight the farthest extents of cruelty, and specifically cruelty toward children. And while it sometimes feels too bananas to be true, one must remember that part of the inspiration for this book was REAL LIVE EVENTS RIGHT HERE IN MODERN AMERICA. So I guess I should shut up about things I don't know. People are evil. I've just been lucky enough to not experience it first hand. One could argue that not all that much actually happens in this book. A lot of the text simply King describing the Institute, coupled with long, internal monologues carried on by the main characters. Surprisingly enough, I liked that. Again, some of the characterizations felt unbelievable, but King works hard to flesh out at least the primary players in his book. So, even though there are really only 7 scenes in this book (view spoiler)[Meet Tim, Meet Luke, Luke at Institute, Luke leaves Institute, Luke and Tim meet, final battle, epilogue (hide spoiler)], the story didn't feel plodding or overdrawn. Impressive again, because this is King we're talking about, and have you ever actually read It? On a nano level, I want to make a comment about language. King uses the phrase ""Great events turn on small hinges"" a few times in this book. Then, later, he refers to a group of ~6 people as ""hinges."" It's like a plea: a few people can make big changes, if only they act. Will you?So, long story short, this is the best of recent Stephen King in my opinion. No clowns or cursed burial grounds or vampires here. Just people being straight up shit, which is arguably the scariest of all. Oh, and stick around for the author's note at the end of the book. I teared up. It was a beautiful tribute and proves yet again how cool King is. But, hey, Stephen King? You may be cool but STOP TRYING TO WRITE IN WHAT YOU DEEM A ""BLACK"" VOICE. IT'S WEIRD AND CRINGY AND KINDA RACIST! Also, just don't use the N-word. Not even once. Not even to bring home a point about those living in the back half of Back half. It doesn't enhance the narrative, and I actually had a visceral reaction to that word on the paper. Just. Stop.

The only reason I can't give it a full 5 stars is because of the frequency with which author Matthew Walker describes scientists depriving rats and other animals of sleep. Reading about humans killing animals to better understand what lack of sleep does to the body is very upsetting, at least for me.

The Tiger's Wife is just my type.Tea Obreht brings us a book that opens on a young doctor, Natalia, who has just found out about her grandfather's death. From there, the book splinters out into three separate stories:1. Natalia, present day, grappling with the death of her grandfather and attempting to assist an orphanage and the people in the surrounding area.2. The story her grandfather purportedly told her about The Deathless Man - a person he met multiple times throughout his life.3. The story her grandfather partially told her about The Tiger's Wife, a woman who had lived in his village when he was a boy. I say partially, because the narrator indicates she had to travel around talking to multiple people from her grandfather's village to get the complete tale, and all the variations thereof. It's a beautifully written book that tackles society's varying relationship with death, losing the person who meant the most to us, superstition, fear as a driver for the things that we do (or don't do)... My one gripe about the book is the idea that the narrator received the stories of The Deathless Man and The Tiger's Wife verbally from her grandfather and others. The rich details and backgrounds make this pretty much impossible, so the reader is either left to think 1. the narrator is lying/filling in gaps with untruths or 2. that the author didn't think it through before putting pen to paper. Considering the earnestness of the narrator, I unfortunately have to land on the latter. The book would have read much better if these stories has been written as sort of asides to the reader, rather than as stories the narrator tells us; stories totally separate from Natalia's personal experiences.This gripe, however, does not take away from the lyricism of Obreht's composition, or from the beauty of the story as a whole. The opening of the book, for those who are on the fence about reading it:The forty days of the soul begin on the morning after death. That first night, before its forty days begin, the soul lies still against sweated-on pillows and watches the living fold the hands and close the eyes, choke the room with smoke and silence to keep the new soul from the doors and the windows and the cracks in the floor so that it does not run out of the house like a river....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Oct 02, 2019","Oct 12, 2019","Oct 02, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8366402-the-tiger-s-wife

It's an anger that says, ""yes, this is still happening, and yes, we do need to talk about it.""Lisa Taddeo followed, you guessed it, three women over a series of years as they navigated their lives, their respective sexualities, and their romantic entanglements. The reader meets Maggie, the woman who was in a sexual relationship with a teacher when she was in high school; Lina, a woman who had a traumatic sexual experience as a teenager, and now struggles with a loveless marriage and a lover who, while he sets her ablaze, seems only tepid about the affair himself; and Sloane, a woman who allowed her husband to decide the open-door-policy of their bedroom, and is trying to make sense of what that means for her happiness, for her sense of self-worth, for her actualization. While these three women had totally different upbringings and formative experiences, they struggle with a remarkably similar set of problems. Where does your partners happiness end and yours begins? When do things stop being amicable, going-along-with-it, and start being a draining, dangerous, repressive agent? How do you know if you're happy? If you were ever happy? How do you explore your own needs without suffocating under the fear of being selfish, of not being fun, or being a ""nag?"" Taddeo isn't merely giving these women a voice, she is unpacking universal questions that women struggle with as it pertains to their sexuality, with three very unique lenses. I've read some critiques on this book, specifically with regards to who Maggie, Lina, and Sloane are. That is: white, ci-gendered, straight(ish), and middle class. Listen, the topic of this book is an empty space, and we could use a lot of different voices on it. However, such a critique feels rather blinded. Taddeo followed these women for years. It is very likely that she had a more, for lack of a better term, diverse, set of candidates on the outset, but as time went on, they likely ultimately dropped out of the project. Why? Perhaps because Taddeo, being white, ci-gendered, straight(ish), and middle class herself, inherently didn't understand something and inadvertently disrespected/hurt the feelings of these other subjects. Perhaps divulging such intimate and difficult details to someone who is, generally speaking, ""other,"" was too uncomfortable an experience. What I'm trying to say is: it doesn't surprise me that Taddeo was only able to hold onto women not unlike herself. Such a project, that requires such safe-space feelings, is monumentally difficult, and Taddeo is lucky she even got three women, white, ci-gendered, straight(ish), and middle class though they may be. All this to say: yes, you'll likely get angry reading this book. But think of what that anger could ultimately become. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Dec 07, 2019","Dec 19, 2019","Aug 30, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/42201100-three-women

You wanted so desperately to be accepted by that other person, that you often weren't totally honest,Do you remember the first time you fell in love? You wanted so desperately to be accepted by that other person, that you often weren't totally honest, often held a part of yourself back. You were driven by the fear that you would somehow lose the affection of that other person if you were too open, too vulnerable. Sally Rooney has harnessed that breathless first love feeling in her book Normal People. Over the course several pivotal years, main characters Connell and Marianne attempt to find themselves as they mature, and, though they sometimes try to fight it, they keep coming back to one another. Despite how much they grow in other ways, they are unable to fully give who they are to the other. ""Don't let them see you cry"" takes on a whole different meaning as they try and protect themselves from their feelings.The book is told from the perspective of both characters, so the reader has a first hand view into how miscommunications happen; how the need to protect the heart ironically leads to more pain. Rooney doesn't use quotations around her speech, so internal and external voices blur. You're never quite sure what the characters are saying to one another, and what they're holding back, until it's too late. My only complaint about the book is that is sort of plods at the end, and it didn't give me what I wanted at the close... but maybe that's the point: when you hold yourself back, you never get what you want.Favorite lines:She wants to tell him things. But it's too late now, and anyway it has never done her any good to tell anyone.xFor weeks now she has had this feeling, the feeling of moving around inside a protective film, floating like mercury.

Retellings can be laborious to read or write, but Miller seems to have been born to tell the story of Circe, removed from the clutches of the male pen (ahem). Banish ye, Madonna vs. Whore, we've actually, for once, have dynamic women in Greek mythology.Miller begins at Circe's inception between her father Helios and her mother Perse (who her mother was is debated, but Miller makes stances, damnit. Plus, I think Hecate would have been harder to write, so...). From there the reader watches the lonely Circe, not beautiful enough for the men, not clever or cruel enough for the women. Miller is masterful at writing the desperation of a neglected child searching for love, and when Circe thinks she's found it, she breaks open the rest of her life.I don't want to walk you down the path of Circe's story, both ancient canon and refurbished by Miller. What would be the point of your reading the story, then? Suffice to say Miller paints a rich world, with familiar Greek characters playing out their parts around Circe, the mocked and underestimated daughter of the god of the sun. Ceaselessly hopeful, the first person narration of Circe draws you ever closer into her search for someone who will listen, someone who will care. As she hones her magics and grows stronger, she simultaneously shrinks back, afraid of scorn, of pain, of a fate even worse than what was already doled out to her. Miller has taken a famed Greek nymph/sorceress and freed her from her ancient cage of lover of Odysseus and transmutator of men. She becomes whole, with her own hopes, fears, and passions. Homer and his bros could have never written a character so utterly Woman. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jan 07, 2020","Jan 17, 2020","Jun 06, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35959740-circe

Or camping in the ice and snow? For Caroline Van Hemert and her husband Pat, it was thoughts of this trip that kept them sane as they toiled at their day jobs. Finally, in 2012, the couple packed off, in boats Pat made himself, and set sail for the Arctic.The passion Van Hemert has for the wilderness is contagious. Her narrative so crisply captures the awe she feels as humpback whales create a bubble net just off shore, as she hikes through territories that show no trace of humanity... save for the countdown climate change has put on these natural wonders.As an ornithologist, Van Hemert cannot help but describe the birds she sees, and provide brief histories of their temperaments and habits. It reads naturally, as Van Hemert effortlessly brings you into the landscape, the creatures, that world.There are heartbreaking passages that speak to climate change and how precarious this landscape is: hawk nests slide down cliffs, where the fledglings will surely die; bears are more hungry, their food sources slowly disappearing; some animals are new to the Arctic, migrating due to the weather pattern changes, and attempting to master the land. It's informative, it's wrenching, it's beautiful.Van Hemert isn't just here to talk about the beauty of nature and the importance of preserving it; she also talks about her father's illness, and about her and Pat's relationship; that simple-yet-complicated love that comes with being married and doing something difficult together. She is honest with her readers, and it shows in the best ways possible. Listen, I really suck at gushing, but this book was incredible. It's a memoir, yes, but it is so much more than that. It is bringing into focus a wondrous world that most people rarely interact with, and is imploring us to take notice before it disappears. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"May 03, 2019","May 12, 2019","May 03, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40696959-the-sun-is-a-compass

AND SO, THIS BOOK WAS BORN.Sex, drugs, and rock 'n roll are the things that have fascinated us since Elvis brought the blues to the white folk. And a fictionalized oral history of the late 60s early 70s sounds like an easy sell. Which is why Jenkins Reid was able to get this published: it certainly wasn't due to literary prowess.Motivations for actions aren't clear, loves and losses aren't fleshed out; it's just broad strokes, the most meager of outlines. As my friend said: ""it reads like she just wanted to get enough out on the page to get a movie deal."" She is so right. Billy is just boring.Daisy is defined entirely by her love of drugs... and then of something else which has no motivation.Eddie is just angry. Full stop.Pete and Warren are shadows. The only redeeming part of this book are the characters Graham and Karen. They are real, messy, and I wish the writing of this book had tracked with the potential of the two of these characters.(view spoiler)[And the reveal that the narrator is Billy and Camila's daughter, Julia, fell so radically flat. To have the narrator just bust in: 'oh, sorry, I'm the only one who can vouch for this part of the story so I just want you to know I'm here and I agree...' seriously?! Also, what was the motivation for writing in the first place? At first it seems like she just wants to capture everything about her parents, but then it seems like she was using it as a device to get closer to the mother she recently lost and that doesn't make any sense since Camila was involved for the majority of the writing AND that the book revolved around Daisy and Billy and NOT Camila and Billy...

The main character having 0 flaws, while stupid, surprisingly didn't detract from the narrative.One thing I didn't mention when ing the first book was women. Why? For one, there aren't many. You could chalk this up to the embracing of ""traditional"" fantasy, where the society is medieval-fashioned: women take care of the home and rarely have any power. But, let's be real, you're building a fantastical universe, the women can be whatever you want, and not having them simply means the author doesn't know how to write them. What's more, the few women who did make an appearance in The Name of the Wind were sort of cold and distant. I figured that was Rothfuss' answer to a strong woman: one who didn't pay much mind to the main character.Nope.As I began reading The Wise Man's Fear, I noticed that the women, now, were really just serving the main character, and didn't have motivations and strengths of their own. Also, lines like ""I'm nervous as a new whore,"" or ""don't look at me, she went crazy on her own,"" were pretty fucked up. But I forged ahead with the book, hoping it'd get better.In the interim, I went to the (male) friend who recommended this series and asked him if he noticed the difference in the female perspective between books. He said no, but he also told me (and this is gossip, so I don't know if this is true and don't care enough to do my own research) that Rothfuss had had no experience with women when he wrote the first book, but had experienced women by the time The Wise Man's Fear was ready to hit the shelves.As I continued reading, this made sense.The women are really just there to move Kvothe along, and to bang him.The one section that really got me riled was when Kvothe spends some time in the ancient land of Adem. This land is characterized by schools which focus on a certain kind of fighting, and the characters Kvothe meets there are overwhelmingly female. This was exciting: women soldiers teaching other women soldiers! Maybe I was wrong all along! However, rather than fleshing out any of these women or speaking to their strengths, Rothfuss chooses instead to have these strong, powerful women all try and bone the main character. (view spoiler)[Even his teacher is all ""oh, you have a boner? want me to take care of that for you?"" WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK. Rothfuss tries to play it off by saying that this culture doesn't think about physical intimacy the way others do but c'mon. This is utterly ridiculous and totally undercuts the female experience of this book. (hide spoiler)]Aside from his inability to write women (I could go on forEVER; I took a lot of notes), the book was still entertaining. Entertaining enough where I wasn't upset by the time I turned the last page. However, there are some weird leaps. Kvothe gets incredibly violent in a couple of scenes, without any real character build-up to him having a capacity for such savagery. Kvothe is able to win over strangers after committing questionable acts without much questioning, which undercuts the whole ""stranger danger"" that Rothfuss has established between cultures. Additionally, the 0 flaws thing from book #1 carries over to The Wise Man's Fear. But, unlike book #1, it now feels clunky and ridiculous. He is able to do all of these things that easily? All conflicts occur externally, rather than Kvothe making any mistakes? And he's just so clever that these are just merely nuisances he quickly flicks away, rather than there being anything substantially difficult? It went from lazy writing but still fun to utterly unbelievable and annoying. I honestly don't know if I could read another book by Rothfuss.(view spoiler)[PS. is it just me, or did Rothfuss totally show his hand toward the end. Kvothe goes to Elodin asking what it says about someone when they keep changing their name, referring to Denna. Elodin, thinking Kvothe is talking about himself, goes WHAT HAVE YOU DONE. You know what that means? The Kvothe who is telling his story at the inn changed his ""true"" name in order to hide most efficiently, or just because he just no longer wants to be Kvothe. That is why he is losing his ability to fight; why he seems to be changing/weakening so rapidly. Is something to help restore his original ""true"" name in that lockless box? Likely.

After tackling the well-worn tracks of the ""Golden Era"" and of Jack the RippePeter Vronsky has been writing about serial killers for quite some time. After tackling the well-worn tracks of the ""Golden Era"" and of Jack the Ripper, he decided to go further back into history, to talk about what our earliest known serial killers looked like and who, with the correct application of the definition, could be considered a serial killer despite their not showing up in any Wikipedia list.I'll say this: Sons of Cain is graphic. Very graphic. Nauseatingly graphic. Skip-some-lines-because-you-can't-handle-the-truth graphic. Not my cup of tea, but I think Vronsky did this on purpose. Contemporary culture has been ramping up its obsession with serial killing and psychopaths/sociopaths. I can come into work, listen to dozens of podcasts on the subject (My Favorite Murder, And That's Why We Drink, Criminal... I mean, I could go on for days), then go home, and watch shows like ""Mindhunter"" or ""You,"" then go to bed reading a book like The Silence of the Lamps or American Psycho. However, all of the examples I've cited above cut out the really gruesome details; they achieve some some light white-washing so as to not lose the fascination of the general public. This? Is a disservice. We've become so obsessed with something we don't actually understand. Penn Badgley got (understandably) pissed off when everyone was swooning over his character Joe in ""You."" Why? Because he's a goddamn murderer, butchering innocent people due to X (I'm not going to attempt to diagnose anyone, even a fictional character. B don't play). Vronsky is looking us in the eye and saying: ""you like this stuff? Alright. But how much do you really know about this stuff? Because it is fucked. These people are fucked. And I'm gonna show you just how fucked all of this is."" So, yea, I had to skim some of the book because of that, but I respect him for shoving back in my face the fact that all of this is incredibly real and incredibly disturbing.To the book itself: if you're looking for an unpacking of the likes of Ted Bundy or Edmond Kemper or any of those ""big American names,"" this isn't the book for you. Vronsky spends a lot of time in Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries, talking about the ideas of vampires and werewolves, and how those myths were actually earlier serial killers. He spends a whole chapter talking about how the witch craze in the 17th century was a church-and-state sanctioned serial killing of women, which was a fascinating and well-researched spin on the topic. He puts forth the argument that all people are inherently serial killers, and only through socializing/parenting do we ""unlearn"" this natural disposition. Reductive? Yes. Leaning hard on nature vs. nurture? Yes. But it's very interesting to mull over, so kudos to Vronsky. He attempts to unpack how a generation of WWII veteran fathers bred a exponential uptick in serial killers, which was fascinating (though he failed to speak to the 1950s over-bearing mother trope, which might have been oversight, or might have been intentional because that's a whole lot more to research, but I'd argue the coupling of PTSD with must-have-perfect-home-where's-my-valium is an important relationship to note).I wouldn't recommend this to many people, save my law enforcement father. It's upsetting, and as a woman it makes you even edgier than you already are (yes, I started carrying my knife in my purse rather than leaving it in my hiking pack after reading this). However, if the psychology and history of how we got to where we are with regards to serial killers and the current fervor over entertainment about serial killers is something you think about, you might want to read Sons of Cain. Just make sure you have a strong stomach, or a strong skimming eye. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Dec 30, 2019","Jan 07, 2020","Mar 04, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/36635914-sons-of-cain

He begins his narrative before the journey even commenced, explaining the backgrounds of the people he focuses in on, and providing vital historical context. This focus on context becomes the tool which made this book stand out for me. Brown might talk about, say, a gun accidentally going off as the company hikes along the plains. But he doesn't stop there. He then explains what guns were like back then, why they often accidentally discharged, and other details as he sees fit. This may sound tediously parenthetical, but I assure you it is not. It feels a seamless way to illustrate the significance of decisions and mistakes made as the Donner party trudged toward their fate. It puts a spotlight on Brown's passion for his project, and just how much research he did to make this book the success it is.Is this book upsetting? Yes, and the squeamish or the happy ending types may not want to read this particular work. However, if the infamy of the Donner party does not send you running away, I could not recommend this book more. It's a historical recounting, sure, but it is also a poignant look into our humanity, our will to survive, and the lasting scars that come with survival. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"May 12, 2019","May 23, 2019","Feb 17, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6033525-the-indifferent-stars-above

I just found the novel deeply sad.Whether or not Toole intended it, his main character Ignatius Reilly reads as someone who has a severe, undiagnosed mental disorder. Are we supposed to laugh at him? Maybe in the 60s, when Toole wrote the book, but I can't laugh at him today. At the start of the novel I was laughing, because Ignatius writes ridiculous letters and waxes poetic about ridiculous things. I thought he was being satirical, but as you read on you realize that the character Ignatius means the things he says, and that's just so goddamn depressing. The NY Times  of this book (in 1981) would disagree with me - stating that this book is successful in satire. I see satire in the Levys, and in the hot dog stand company owner... but that's kind of it. Should I set fire to my English MA?What's also depressing is Ignatius' relationship with his mother. He verbally abuses her, she physically abuses him back. He is 30yrs old, living at home, with no job aspirations, and she is spending what little money she has on buying him cakes and tickets to the movies and his every whim. This is... funny? To whom?We are also expected to laugh at a police man who is slowly dying due to his department's mistreatment of him.And a black man attempting to stay out of jail. His crime? The color of his skin. Was this a harsh look at racial relationships by Toole? It isn't obvious, which is incredibly problematic for me. The 60s is too late in history for me to forgive opaque racism like this. Minor characters such as the petty thief George and Mrs. Levy manage to illicit weak chuckles, but I couldn't find myself appreciating this when sandwiched between slut shaming and rampant homophobia. I'm honestly open to a deeper read of the text, if anyone can present it to me. However, every book  I've read has left me going ""wait, but you haven't shown me the satire,"" and, since Toole did not live to see the publication of his novel, we'll never know what it was he intended. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,Feb 2019,"Feb 16, 2019","Feb 01, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/422612.A_Confederacy_of_Dunces

Following the Biafran War/Nigerian Civil War (1967-1970), Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie tracks 5 people as they bend and break in a nation rocked by violence and starvation.The narrative oscillates between the early 60s (peace time) and the late 60s (war time). As a sucker for disjointed timelines, I relished the foreshadowing in the early 60s, and the hint of transgressions and resentments not yet seen in the late 60s. Adichie is a master of language; writing in a way that pulls your heart taut, that makes you ache, that makes you cry. I had to wake my husband up to read him the following line:""Death would be a complete knowingness, but what frightened him was this: not knowing beforehand what it was he would know.""Adichie picks her characters carefully, ensuring the best cross-section of experience. We have the twins Olanna and Kainene, who come from a rich family, their only exposure to ""the bush"" when they visit an Aunt. There's Olanna's paramour, Odenigbo, an Igbo intellectual who believes in ""The Cause,"" and separating from Nigeria. Meanwhile, Kainene is romantically involved with Richard, an Englishman who originally came to Africa for inspiration for his novel, but stays for love. Lastly, Ugwu is Odenibgo's houseboy, struggling to exist both within his humble upbringing and his Master's high society life. To explain more is to give away the richness of narrative, the complicated relationships that ebb and flow, the tragedy and heartbreak.

I totally get that - and could totally get behind that. But power gets to even the most altruistic-seeming minds, and poisons the well. While there is no question that Jones always had a darker ulterior motive to his church and his following, it is exceedingly sad to think of all those people who were simply searching for a better life, and ended up losing out on life entirely. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Nov 24, 2018","Dec 23, 2018","Nov 24, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/40726412-the-road-to-jonestown

So how in the hell did he become so damn sexist?!I went into this book looking for academic discourse on violence inflicted on people by people. I wanted to read about how to see and react warning signs, how to de-escalate potentially dangerous situations, and perhaps read up on some of the psychology behind violence.That is so not what this book is about.This book is about stating the obvious with no actual practical applications, while managing to tell women they're stupid in one overly long, overly graphic narrative. Let's break down some of the more egregious passages, shall we?""Cynthia is a substitute schoolteacher, a funny, beautiful woman totally unlike the dull and much-harassed substitutes most of us recall from our school years.""Hi. You are objectifying this woman for no reason. Nice.""I encourage women to ask other women for help when they need it, and it’s likewise safer to accept an offer from a woman than from a man. (Unfortunately, women rarely make such offers to other women, and I wish more would.)""What the actual fuck. How do you have any sort of reliable statistic stating that women rarely offer to help other women. You don't offer any evidence, so we'll have to assume you're a big, fat liar who thinks women are useless. It is insulting. It is disgusting. Shame on you, sir.When discussing how a man woke up in the middle of the night to a noise, went downstairs to investigate, didn't find anything, and ultimately woke up a second time to a man standing over him with a gun:""Had he responded to his fear with respect, he would have found the intruder before the intruder found his gun. If he had said, in effect, 'Since I feel fear, I know there is some reason, so what is it?'""So... wait... you're telling me every time I hear a noise in my house it's a murderer and I should stay up all night waiting for the attack? What in the hell is de Becker trying to get at with this passage (we don't know, because he never elaborates on the point of this or HOW one respects fear without being a slave to it). He spends a decent chunk of the book telling women that they are worried about the possibility of violence, which manifests fear for no reason, and we all need to chill the fuck out. But for some reason a random noise in the night (which happens to all of us at some point) is cause to ASSUME there is a murderer in the house?! How is that logic?! I'm thinking it was because it was a MAN who heard the noise, and that MEN should trust their fear while WOMEN are afraid of possibility rather than actuality. Because what else am I supposed to take away from this? SERIOUSLY. TELL ME.In general, de Becker tells us that the warning signs of violence are ""obvious,"" but that is patently untrue. Each person is unique, and each person reacts to levels of engagement/non-engagement differently. To claim there is one universal way to handle people is naive and, quite frankly, dangerous. He also goes on to claim that the police are relatively useless in many cases... so what does knowing these warning signs actually do for us? Who knows - certainly not de Becker.

Yeah, yeah, I know he won an award for his first book Ordinary Wolves, but I am going to argue it was for the original lens he brings, rather than acknowledgment of verbal prowess.Because here's the thing: Kantner doesn't need to be a writer to make this book interesting. His life is so original compared to what we in the lower 48 experience, that the book is interesting just by way of being written by this particular man. Kantner was born and raised in Northern Alaska. His father had moved up to Alaska, in love with the wildness of the landscape, and successfully started a family of ""whiteboys"" up there (Kantner's parents now live in Hawaii, and I do wonder what spurred that change).

Living in handmade sod igloos and regularly having mice scurry across your face in the night doesn't sound like a barrel of laughs to me, but Kantner embraces where he is from, and writes un-apologetically about animal skin tack boards in the kitchen and eating bowls of bear fat for a meal. I did enjoy that, as the memoir winds down, Kantner takes the time to discuss the changing landscape and how climate change has negatively effected his community. Kantner isn't just here to entertain us with stories of hunting moose and navigating tundra - he's here to remind us just how much is at stake to lose.

Having read The Lottery and We Have Always Lived in the Castle, I felt marginally introduced to Jackson, but didn't quite get the hype. Yea, The Lottery has one of the most famous twists in literary history, but We Have Always Lived in the Castle, at least to me, sort of plodded along, and didn't have any of the thrill/chill factor that had been touted out by s and the masses.Not so with The Haunting of Hill House. The story centers around Eleanor; a woman who hasn't had much happen to her in her life, who receives an invitation from a Dr. Montague to spend her summer at Hill House. She is desperate to have experiences of her own, to actually live, so she accepts, along with the gregarious Theodora and the roguish heir to Hill House, Luke. And a haunting they will go.Beautiful prose, clever slips into first person narrative, and a haunting described so damn well that I actually needed to stop reading it before bed, The Haunting of Hill House is clearly a pillar of the horror genre. It's not surprising that Jackson's masterpiece has been adapted several times over and, when not directly ripped from, is inspiration for many other haunted house iterations. I loved it, I'll read it again, and I implore you to do the same.I leave you with the first, magnificent, paragraph:No live organism can continue for long to exist sanely under conditions of absolute reality; even larks and katydids are supposed, by some, to dream. Hill House, not sane, stood by itself against its hills, holding darkness within; it had stood so for eighty years and might stand for eighty more. Within, walls continued upright, bricks met neatly, floors were firm, and doors were sensibly shut; silence lay steadily against the wood and stone of Hill House, and whatever walked there, walked alone....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Oct 08, 2018","Oct 15, 2018","Oct 01, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15808307-the-haunting-of-hill-house

The hot pink cover was... a choice.I went into this wanting a rage read. I figured this would be an easy book to dislike, hate even, and hate with glee. The vibes I had going into this book was that Beck Dorey-Stein used her being a stenographer at the White House to get a book deal, then used that book deal to whine about her relationships. While those vibes weren't totally off the mark, I was bowled over by one thing:Dorey-Stein can actually write.It's undercut by the fact that she keeps bringing up how she wants to be a writer (sidebar: can we just decide, right here and now, that memoir-ists are no longer allowed to bring this up? Like, clearly you wanted to be a writer BECAUSE DUH, I'M READING YOUR BOOK. YOU ARE ONE), but still, she can write, which is more than I can say for a lot of other memoirs I've read. The story begins in 2011, as Dorey-Stein is attempting to find a job in DC, floundering as most 20somethings do. When she responds to a Craigslist ad, she is shocked to realize she is about to interview at the White House, for a job as one of Obama's stenographers. The reader then follows her for 5yrs, as she rides out Obama's second term and tries to find herself within the clique-y, partying life of White House staffdom.I gotta know: is her experience the universal White House staffer experience? I've heard tale that the show Veep is the most accurate portrayal of what goes on ""up on the hill,"" but is everyone truly just going out and getting smashed and boning each other all the time? Cause, like, I think I chose the wrong early 20s career path, guys.Other than some poignant sentiments dropped by Obama, and Dorey-Stein's Saved By the Bell-esque addresses to the camera when something historically significant/sad happens (think of all the shootings that happened between 2011 - 2017), this book is really about Dorey-Stein's on-again-off-again affair with a senior staffer she pseudonyms Jason, but who the internet hive mind has decided was either Dan Pfeiffer or Marvin Nicholson. Dorey-Stein is very eyes-open about the toxicity of this 5yr affair, in part, I'd have to guess, because she has the journals to reflect on (when I look at my journals from college and the pining I did... **shudder**). It's a very unapologetic account of what emotional abuse can look like, and how we can accept the love we think we deserve. I applaud her bravery for laying bare how helpless she was in the face of someone she loved, who didn't love her back. We could all learn to be a little kinder to one another, and to treat the hearts that are handed to us with care. So, don't go into this book expecting a holistic look into working for Obama in his second term, and what White House life is like. Go into it because you like coming-of-age stories, because DC is a cool city, and because we all need to take a step back and be more gentle, more patient... just better. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Sep 22, 2019","Oct 02, 2019","Aug 27, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36758503-from-the-corner-of-the-oval

Like all good college students, they want to test their limits, expand their minds, have experiences no one else has had......LIKE MURDER WHHOOAOAOAOAOAAAA.This book sounded promising to me. Like Dead Poet's Society revved up a notch. That's not what this is.There are 6 characters to care about: the scary tall one, the fat loud one, the boy twin, the girl twin, the gay one (is that reductive of me? Apparently not, because even with a gay character the book manages to be homophobic and tone deaf), and the poor one aka our narrator. The narrator really wants to get into the classics clubs because they all seem so exotic to him: they wear tweed! And smoke! And eat out at fine dining clubs (I mean, where are we, an F. Scott Fitzgerald novel?! This is the fucking 1990s). So the narrator petitions the eccentric professor (twice) and joins their ranks, lying about who he is and where he is from to fit in (always great when you need to lie to make friends). The group cavorts, never really doing their work, just lazing about in their excesses (again, I see you, Fitzgerald), until the tall scary one decides they gotta do some weird shit to, like heighten their state of being or whatever.Cool.So they go frolicking into the woods and weird stuff happens which leads to death and lying and the tall scary one KILLS A FRIGGIN' DOG FOR NO REASON AND HIM BEING A SOCIOPATH IS NEVER UNPACKED. The narrator hardly thinks what is going on is odd or bad. We get a time jump at the end which should have served as, I don't know, something. But there is practically zero reflection on just how terribly their time together at college went. The characters also don't grow. They're just... trapped. Because Donna Tartt is trying to be Fitzgerald, but worse.The writing was decent and I liked excerpts because of her language, but all-in-all this is a story about rich kids being rich and getting away with literal murder just because they're rich. Oh and the richness is absurd. Buying last-minute international flights and racking up hundreds upon hundreds of dollars at restaurants and, like, jesus, your credit cards are going to catch on fire, aren't they?Oh, and incest is thrown in there for funsies with no unpacking of it BECAUSE THAT MAKES SENSE.Thanks a lot, Donna.The hero of this story is Judy Poovey - THANK YOU FOR BEING A NORMAL COLLEGE STUDENT WITH A NORMAL ARC.

I think she just really is that cool. Beautifully written, heartbreaking and captivating material, this might be the best memoir that has come out in 50+ years.

The alien being, Genly Ai, has been tasked with getting the people of Gethen to join a sort of intergalactic society, but in his voyage is swept up by the politics and nuances of a world utterly unknown to him. It is exceedingly difficult to explain this story without giving anything away. Genly Ai is a clever narrator, providing both the raw awe and curiosity that comes from learning about people so different from him, as well as a critical lens into how they run their world. Genly Ai's narration is joined by:1. The narration of Therem Harth rem ir Estraven, a political big wig in one of the sub-societies of this world. Estraven, as he (though the people of Gethen do not have a defined sex, they are almost always referred to with male pronouns) is often referenced in the book, struggles with trying to understand Genly Ai, while preserving his love of country. He is beautifully complicated and unfailingly optimistic.2. Folk tales native to Gethen, which provide the reader with some societal context, as well as a glimpse into the religion and moralities of this world. This book requires slow and careful reading. Le Guin hasn't created an entirely new language, but, like A Clockwork Orange, she has provided just enough new words to slow the reader down as new landscapes are described, as high courts are established, as the players involved are introduced. This brings me to my biggest gripe about the book: many characters in this book have a Tolstoy-esque list of nick/pet/secondary names, so much so that I found myself flipping back and forth during the first half of the book, trying to remember who belonged to which names. I will say, though, when I complained about this to a friend, she said:""Don't you think that the utilization of different names represents the level intimacy certain characters have with others, which only provides more richness to the narrative?""Well fuck, color me embarrassed. She's right, but I still hate having to flip back and forth!Le Guin deals with sex and gender, loyalty and betrayal, honor and duty, all in a slim 300 pages. The Left Hand of Darkness rings particularly true in American society today, to the point where I found myself furiously scribbling down passages to remember. I leave you with those now:…Tibe dismissed it with scorn. He was after something surer, the sure, quick, and lasting way to make people into a nation: war. His ideas concerning it could not have been too precise, but they were quite sound. The only other means of mobilizing people rapidly and entirely is with a new religion; none was handy; he would make do [sic] with war. In the beginning there was the sun and the ice, and there was no shadow. In the end when we are done, the sun will devour itself and shadow will eat light, and there will be nothing left but the ice and the darkness.I wondered, not for the first time, what patriotism is, what the love of country truly consists of, how the yearning loyalty that has shaken my friend’s voice arises, and how so real a love can become, too often, so foolish and vile a bigotry. Where does it go wrong?

It's a frank introspection on how we as people weave stories about others we meet ever-so-briefly, and how so completely wrong we can be in our first impressions. Also, I had read ""The Prairie Wife"" in a New Yorker last year, and loved the account of coming into your sexuality just as much the second time as I had the first. There are so few stories about queerness that do so with subtlety, and as a queer woman I thank Sittenfeld ten times over for this story.

Yet I had absolutely no idea about the extended tension between Japanese and Koreans, about how the WWII through Korean War period was a one marked by so much suffering. An American character at the close of Pachinko states she never learned about internment camps, never studied Hiroshima in her history classes. We don't talk about these traumatic histories; we have to learn about them through the softening lens of historical fiction. So, way to go, public education system. Pachinko spans over 100 years (~1893 - 1989), following one Korean family. We begin with Hoonie, born with a cleft palate to innkeeper parents. Despite the social repercussions that come with this deformity, Hoonie is matched with farmer's daughter Yangjin. As Japan annexes Korea, as Korean ghettos languish in Japan, as WWII bombs shake their adopted country, as the Korean War bursts onto the stage, this tendril-ing family continues their fight for survival, for acceptance, for stability. In these 500+ pages, Hoonie & Yangjin's daughter, grandsons, and great-grandson live out their lives as best they can, interacting with and pushing against the machine of time and progress. I don't know what to say that hasn't been unpacked by others before me. This book is wildly depressing. The cruelty of children and adults alike, the sexism, the racism, the bigotry... it's a lot to take in. But Pachinko is so beautifully written you'll persevere. Because it's important. Because reading it might make us just a little bit kinder, a smidge more patient. My only real complaint about this book is the characters Ayame and Hanna, though unpacking that bristling requires some minor spoilers, so... (view spoiler)[Hanna, I guess, serves a purpose in the narrative. She's an example what happens to a ""forgotten woman,"" as it were, in this society. But she didn't have to be one, so reading her was just kind of infuriating, especially at the end, with her calling Solomon and being ssuuppeerrr manipulative. Seriously? Ugh.As for Ayame, like, we already knew Haruki was gay. We didn't need to see it through his wife's eyes for one, brief chapter. If Min Jin Lee really needed us to see that park where everyone is banging, we could have seen Haruki's first experience there or something.I gotta say, though, even these complaints didn't really take away from the book experience. I just skimmed the Hanna bits at the end cause life is short to be angry at a fictional character. (hide spoiler)]PS., I didn't know what Pachinko was before reading this book. So... yea.

Michelle McNamara worked with generations of detectives who were assigned to the case of the EARS-ON/Original Nightstalker/Ransacker (all of the names he was given before McNamara coined ""Golden State Killer""), as well as with a robust online network of hobbyist sleuths. Over a number of years she put together this comprehensive, well-written, and gripping account of the 50 odd rapes and 10 murders the Golden State Killer committed in the 1970s and 80s. She weaves narrative of the lives of the victims and the crimes themselves, then she pivots to interviews with detectives who were there, and summarizes new technologies to try and detail how the responsible could be caught today (I think that phrasing, ""the responsible,"" which McNamara uses in the book after reading it in a police report, is the best way to describe The Golden State Killer).If you ever look at the news, you may know that a man has been arrested as the suspected ""responsible"" since the publishing of this book. A better ending than the book itself leaves us with, which is hopeful and angry all at the same time. McNamara was a true professional in her craft, and was taken from us too soon. This book will no doubt live on in the halls of incredible true crime fiction, along with Capote and Bugliosi. And to all you other hobbyist sleuths out there: keep looking.

Over the years the genre of chick flick has spiraled down a drain of ""what, how do you string a sentence together?"" and ""life only matters as much as when you get married and have children.""Yuck.A 20something Indian woman trying to find herself in London while also trying to stay connected with her family and heritage but without losing her sense of self and modernity could have missed the boat on female empowerment entirely.

While Nikki has affection for her Indian culture, she's not so sold on the whole subservience thing. She answers an ad to teach at what is essentially an Indian community center, and things get a little... ah... raunchy.Oh, and there's also a death shrouded in mystery and some really, really scary dudes stomping around trying to make sure the women don't have fun.Jaswal does an impressive job of balancing young-woman-finding-herself meets a commentary on Indian culture meets a commentary on domestic abuse and Womens Rights meets smutty stories as means of empowerment. It's a critical, important societal lens that's been packaged so that people who shy away from things that matter might actually accidentally learn something.

Whatever the intent, the result was a whiny memoir that lacked what it had billed: details of being a chef.The beginning was interesting: how she grew up, the details of her French mother making very French dishes for the family. But from there the book begins to spiral. We get a glimpse of Ms. Hamilton working in a kitchen or two in NYC, but then she goes on a ~2yr backpacking tour of the world, which she manages to gloss over, focusing instead on being cold and hungry in Amsterdam (um... playing the smallest violin for you? You got to travel the fucking world; check your privilege/you didn't have to go), and the fact that her mother's friend let her work at her cafe in France.

The interludes about Italian mothers cooking Italian foods were delightful, but too few and far between. This book should NOT be considered a chef memoir.

This, my friends, is the OG version of the how-to-guide, without any of MFK Fisher's later face palms at her younger self.The purpose of How to Cook a Wolf is to teach its readers how to make due with what they have on hand when nourishment is difficult to procure. Published in 1942, Fisher was talking, primarily, about war rationing and general hunger secondary to the poverty that still clung to folks post-Great Depression. These pages hold dozens of recipes for the 1942 household. My two favorites were:1. Something she calls ""sludge."" It's a thick oatmeal-type food that is made using grain and, if you can afford it (and/or even find it), meat. You leave it somewhere cool and dark and can eat of it exclusively if that's all your circumstances allow. 2. ""A vodka."" If you can't get your hands on legitimate spirits, says MFK Fisher, go to a druggist and just get a quart of ""alcohol"" and mix it together with some lemon rind and diluters. WHAT. WHAT. WHAT.It was especially interesting to read post-COVID panic-buying. We didn't have to contend with sugar rations or anything of that ilk, even in the worst of it. Reading a book that lays out how to make the little bit of ""before"" that a household was allotted really brought things into perspective. There's a bit of weird classism in this book (which is odd, since parts of this book dictate how one can survive when one has nothing) and also some racism, because, you know, 1942. But if you can look past those How to Cook a Wolf quite an interesting peer into the past. Also, shocker, there is a bit of sexism in this book. One of the wilder things I read was Fisher urging women to always have a mirror with a shelf attached in the kitchen so one could powder her nose quickly even if company arrives unexpected. Nah, bitch, I ain't powdering nothing in the kitchen. She also suggests one moisturizes their hands with butter and their meatloaf mixture... which... gag. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Sep 26, 2021","Sep 27, 2021","Jan 19, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/250693.How_to_Cook_a_Wolf

It's... cold. It feels one step removed. While the anger and the hurt and the love is spelled out for us through the prose, there is nothing that is felt inherently. With a novel circling around something as emotionally charged as female friendship, you'd expect passion and earnest. Instead, Elena is simply providing an account of her childhood, without reliving it.

Pullman got me through my adolescence - Lyra was a strong, young, female character I could look to when I was feeling small or not listened to or too young to make a difference. The His Dark Materials trilogy rocked me in the best possible way. They've stood the test of time: reading them when I was 13, then in college, and just recently in my late 20s, the characters have not dulled for me, the language does not feel dumbed down (they are, after all, YA books), and the messages of agency and science still punch home.What, then, do we say about La Belle Sauvage a book which follows young Malcolm as he stumbles into adventure? He is a pawn, where Lyra was fiercely independent. He is naive and wide-eyed, where Lyra was shrewd and cunning. Perhaps Pullman wants to give us this juxtaposition for later books, but I cannot help but feel that La Belle Sauvage is simply here to set us up for what's to come; not only do I feel that, I hope that, or else this new trilogy will be massively disappointing.The plot is fledgling.

Also, there are vignettes in the novel that I really loved, most specifically the stories from Mr. Honda's war-time friend. They are raw, harrowing, masterful.But the plot proper? We follow the main character. First, he loses his cat. Then, a sex caller calls him for I guess no reason. Then, odd occurrences keep happening to him which aren't well-explained and all involve women. There are several magical elements to the story as well, which also aren't explained. And the main character blunders for years through his isolated life, simply letting things happen to him.And the flaws.First, the women. I could probably spend an hour railing against how Murakami writes the women in his book, but I'll spare you. Here's the line up:A wife whose motivations and emotions and drives are never fleshed outA female sex caller who is never explainedA woman who has... telepathy? Something akin to that? Who doesn't explain what her powers are, why she's interested in the main character, or what she does outside of helping men.Another woman who only describes herself in terms of the sex she has with men.Another woman who becomes preoccupied with the main character for no reason other than she is compelled to buy clothes for him so he is better dressed.A 16yr old girl who strikes up a towing-the-line inappropriate relationship with the main character.Thanks, Murakami, for allowing your women to exist outside the frame of Man. OH WAIT. The main character is also never worried about his missing cat, which speaks to something deeply fucked up within him.I'd get into the plot holes, but it'd spoil too much.(view spoiler)[So... what happened to Malta? Why didn't the explain that? And who exactly was the sex caller? And did Creta really have a child who was ""half"" the main character's? That's not how genetics work. And did Mr. Honda's war-time buddy finally receive the peace of death? And what the hell happened with Nutmeg's husband?!?!

Her parents had a tempestuous relationship with both each other and with their children: her father had an alcohol addiction which led him to be cruel and abusive to the mother, while the mother played the part of resentful homemaker, more interested in creating art than providing for the children who languished hungry and under-cared for. I will never look at a chicken carcass the same way after reading Walls.Her descriptions are incredible, though I suppose that sort of childhood sticks with you. Walls explains that, no matter how sick, she would always go to school, because at school there was heat and food - two things that home often lacked. She worked hard to make a future for herself, though the guilt of ""getting out"" seeps through the narrative at times.I do wonder about her youngest sister, though, by the sounds of it, Walls wonders about her as well. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Nov 03, 2017","Nov 08, 2017","Nov 03, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7445.The_Glass_Castle

That being said, while I would implore everyone to read her, I would caution against reading this. We Tell Ourselves Stories in Order to Live contains 7 of her books. While each one is an interesting compilation of articles, reading them all together over the span of 1.5 months was a lot, especially considering the depressing realities Didion is touching on. Slouching Toward Bethlehem is an excellent collection of how the end of the 1960s rocked the nation. It touches on senseless crime, on drugs, on the listlessness that can set in. The White Album becomes more of an introspective. Didion writes some personal essays, but still stays true to her reporting background. Salvador is investigative journalism through-and-through, with some Didion flair inserted for good measure.Miami I didn't much like, I have to say.After Henry sort of drags a bit, since I do not care about the celebrities of yesteryear.

I don't understand so utterly that I'm actually angry at the close of this book.So, Magpie Murders opens up with the editor of fictional author, Alan Conway, telling us how she felt after finishing Mr. Conway's newest manuscript. She asks us to see for ourselves, and we spent ~250 uninterrupted pages reading that exact manuscript.The murder mystery fictional Conway wrote is... fine? I guess? It's pretty contrived, but I muscled through it hoping that getting back to the editor's story would yield something more original and, well, good.NOPE.We get back to the ""real"" story line and are met with an editor who is... writing to us (who is us? The police? WE DON'T KNOW), I guess, about how the manuscript is incomplete and how good the story we all just read together was (uh, no). And, hey, if she's an editor... WHY THE FUCK CAN'T SHE WRITE?! Holy christ... does Horowitz not allow anyone to edit his work? But more on that later.Unsurprisingly, fictional author Alan Conway has purportedly committed suicide right after editor Susan finishes reading the manuscript.So Susan goes to her boss and is all ""where are the rest of the pages."" And her boss is all ""Dunno, crazy about the deadness though, amirite?!""Susan decides she is going to go out to Alan Conway's house to try and find the missing pages ('cause that's appropriate and makes sense...) and somehow falls into a detective role herself as she inserts herself into the lives of everyone Alan Conway knew because HE MAY HAVE BEEN MURDERED OOOOOOOHOHHHHHHOHOHOHHH.Shoot me. Seriously. Shoot me cause I'd like to be murdered myself. This whodunnit is so wildly obvious with gaping plot holes you fall into and break your legs and the writing is so completely uninspired and how do books like this get published and maybe I shouldn't be reading anything that was published after the first Twilight book came out because I'm pretty sure that is what spurred this idea that writers don't need to be edited.This book should not exist. And I'm not even going to get into the ending, because fuck you you should have to be subjected to this madness too rather than have me spell it out for you. Here are some samplings. I took them solely from Susan-the-editors narrative because that one is SO MUCH WORSE than Alan Conway's fake manuscript. Detailing the arrival to Alan Conway's house:""I don't need to go into all the details of Alan's computer. I wasn't interested in emails, his Google history or the fact that he played electronic Scrabble. All I wanted was the manuscript. He used Word for Mac and we quickly found the last two novels.""I pull this because none of this needs to exist. This rambling bullshit adds exactly nothing to the story. If I were grading a student's creative writing piece I would take a red pen to all of this with the note ""what does this contribute to the story?"" That question is rhetorical though because the answer is NOTHING. Susan on her sister:""The two of us live in different worlds. She's much slimmer than I am and takes more care with her appearance. She dresses in sensible clothes, which she buys from catalogues, and has her hair done once a fortnight.""...Why? We know very little about Susan, so maybe this was Horowitz's half-assed attempt to flesh her out but these are the most stupid musings on a sibling that have ever been put on paper.This shit:""It was a perfect excuse to take out the MGB Roadster that I'd bought myself six years ago, on my fortieth birthday. It was a ridiculous car but I'd known I had to have it the moment I saw it for sale outside a garage in Highgate: a 1969 model, manual with overdrive, and an in-your-face, pillar-box red with black trim.""WHO CARES ABOUT THIS CAR?!?!?! WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING?!And this shit:""A waiter went past with a tray and I snatched a glass of white whine. It was warm and sluggish, a Pinot Grigio, I think.""How does ""warm and sluggish"" describe any wine, let alone allow Susan to discern it is a Pinot Grigio... she thinks.

The story follows three women: Clara, Blanca, and Alba; different generations of women in the same family who work through passion, loss, political upheaval, and the cruelty of men.

I will bring up a couple of the questions that surfaced for me in reading this book, and will not provide my answers, in the hopes it entices you to read it yourself (can you tell I chose this book for book club?):What does it say about Allende's characterization of men that Clara's daughter has a successful story arc with a happy ending, while her sons fade into confusion?How do we feel about a rapist becoming a sympathetic character by the close of the novel? (This question is honestly one of the only reasons I give this book 4 stars instead of 5. I am having a very difficult time reconciling this.)As an American reader, how does Allende's lens into Latin culture inform what we know about countries outside of our own? What does Ferula's character tell us about being a queer latina?Who was chopping onions while I was reading this book, because seriously, it's beautiful.

His friendly/stern personality endears most people to him, and it's through this bonding with others that he is able to entrench himself into those who knew the victims most, and thus solve the crime and save the day.This first introduction to Gamache, Still Life involves a sleepy little village called Three Pines and the death of an older woman named Jane, with whom no one had any qualms and who was perhaps killed in a hunting accident rather than in cold-blood... but what do you think?There were a lot of weird bits about this book:1. The novel focuses a lot on the couple Clara and Peter, as Clara was sort of surrogate daughter to the late Jane. But their relationship makes no sense. They don't communicate, they become angry with one another easily, the narrator acknowledges that they're a pair that doesn't make sense... yet Penny makes no attempt to explain why their relationship is so unhealthy, or if it will ever get better. This was incredibly frustrating and I'm still frustrated. I actually developed a bit of an eye twitch reading over this passive aggressive couple.2. There's a lot of fat shaming in this book. It just felt mean. 3. The way Penny addresses homosexuality is borderline offensive. She dances around it, and leaves it hanging out there as to whether or not it's okay to be anything other than a white, heterosexual man. I mean... really?4. What was the point of Yvette Nichol as a character? A foil for Gamache? A way to humanize him and illustrate that his judgment isn't always sound? Maybe she crops up in the other novels and becomes a more central character, but she feels like a waste of space in Still Life. Okay, but out-of-place characters and weird stances on certain types of people aside, this book is just... fine, I guess. The murderer reveal wasn't a surprise, and that always sucks, but the more befuddling aspect of this book is Penny's diction. Everything is just so dang flowery in this book, and it doesn't jive well with a murder mystery. I think Penny would have much preferred writing about the fall foliage in Canada over actually having to send the plot forward. And that, too. There isn't much happening between death and reveal of murderer. There's a lot of description of food and drink, and some description of art (why is it that almost every resident of Three Pines is an artist? Is that a joke? Do they have plumbers? Doctors? What the actual hell?), but the story lacks the suspense a mystery really should have. Maybe I'm just grumpy, or maybe I'm right.

Schumer attempts to pepper in life advice at the end of her chapters, but they just come off preachy.Example: Schumer tells the story of how she wrote an article for Men's Health and how they mocked it up with a bunch of pictures of hot, skinny models.She could have taken this experience and talked about how women are too often utilized as objects. Instead, she rants about how they didn't ask her to model for the article. I mean, really? You have an opportunity to highlight how all women are treated, but you make it about you?Example: Schumer notes the shooting that happened at a showing of Trainwreck, and two girls died.She could have used her time to talk about the families and the girls. She instead discusses how it affected her and how she overcame the tragedy....Uuhhhh...The navel-gazing ""I can drink really expensive wine now and I shower my friends with $$ and all of these famous people want to hang out with me and isn't being rich and famous awesome?"" was maddening. Why didn't her editor take her aside and say ""now Amy, very few people can relate to this, and you sound like an asshole."" ?Who knows, maybe the editor did.

Now imagine that person writes a novel which weaves together several fairy tale stories and Shakespeare plays together into a rollercoaster narrative of awesome.Didja your brain follow that? Well, then you're starting to understand what it's like to read Terry Pratchett.This is the 3.5th (or is it ""rd""?) Pratchett book I've read (Good Omens only counts as one half, I'd think) and it is hands down my favorite. The Color of Magic is a lot of fun and Mort, though original and delightfully quirky, got a little plodding at times. Wyrd Sisters, on the other hand, was nothing short of a masterpiece of fantasy. It may be my college education getting excitable at the work out it received from so many literary references packed into such a slight novel, but I really, really enjoyed this book. It was, I think the most fun I've ever had reading something.Wyrd Sisters tells the tale of a mad king and his devilish wife, angrily/crazily ruling over a kingdom wherein three witches live and argue about what exactly it is to be a witch. As royalty and magic begin to butt heads, we meet a troop of performers, a too-clever Fool, and a Guild of Burglers.If this sounds weird and confusing then good, it should. The story bounces all over, with side tangents and a sentient forest and demons getting all bent out of shape about being summoned. It's a book that maybe shouldn't be read in public, unless you're totally cool with laughing for no reason and having people look at you oddly. Which, I mean, you really should be okay with.

I knew that The Dust Bowl had been a thing. But I had no idea the extent of it, how the rest of the country reacted, and the longitudinal changes that came from it. It's unsurprising that we were devastating the land with abandon back then, though it sucks that we've learned essentially nothing from The Dust Bowl, and continue to flip off the Earth while mining it for all of its useful bits without thinking about the future. The TL;DR is as follows: a bunch of white people went out west to get away from the pollution of the cities and to make it as farmers. They killed all the bison and chased all the indigenous people off of the land. Wheat became a Big Deal, and so more white people hopped trains west to try and make some cash during the wheat boom. Long term residents of the area (NE, KS, OK, TX, and some of CO) warned that the rainy seasons of the 20s were abnormal, and that the area might not be able to support the massive amounts of wheat being planted. But hubris reined, and the interlopers ripped out all of the naturally occurring crop (mostly buffalo grass), to plant their wheat. First, the price of wheat began to plummet. Then the rains stopped, and the area sunk into another drought spell, not uncommon for the area. The plains no longer contained the buffalo grass which ""kept the ground in place,"" as folks were saying, and so prairie winds ripped through and lifted topsoil off of the ground and into the air at higher and higher rates as the years of drought ticked by. That swirling topsoil would slam back to earth, covering houses, killing children and the elderly with ""dust pneumonia,"" and generally wreaking havoc. The ""dust spells"" as they were called, even made their way out easy to NY and DC. Eventually, FDR and time created the change needed to try and heal the area, though, as of the book's publishing (2006), parts of the great plains are still totally barren; forever scarred by our selfishness. The really fucked up thing about this book is the stubbornness of the people. So many were wildly unwilling to stop ripping out the buffalo grass. They insisted that the wheat prices would bounce back, that the droughts were temporary, that they hadn't done anything wrong. Wheat was rotting at the train stations of the great plains while people in cities starved. It hit me hard, thinking about the footage of so much milk being dumped at the beginning stages of COVID, while people lost their jobs and went hungry. Our country still sucks at reacting to a crisis. And we, as a whole, still suck at taking care of the planet.

Sommeliers are an intriguing group of humans who dedicate their lives to unpacking the nuance of taste and experience for those who can afford to frequent a restaurant which would employ one. Bianca Bosker could have written a really excellent book about all of this, had she not insisted on inserting personal bullshit that makes her come off as a pretentious Basic Bitch who muscles her way into places she shouldn't be.I could end there, but I'll go further: there are chapters of Cork Dork which sing. Bosker flexes her journalism background as she educates her reader on how restaurants came to be, what the first sommeliers were like, and how our bodies interact with smell and taste. I really enjoyed the discussion of smell as a ""forgotten"" sense, and how other cultures, which rely more heavily on smell, can pick up faint odors that the standard American would completely overlook. It's not just a history lesson, it's an acknowledgment that we experience things too rushed, that we need to take a step back and savor. It's advice not just for the palate, but for the soul, and I tip my hat to that introspection on American culture.That being said, the Bosker we meet in the book is the type of person who takes up the whole sidewalk with her friends, who inserts herself into conversations she has no business being in, who loudly makes the party about her, who incorrectly corrects people when they're just trying to tell an anecdote. She's the girl at the party I always hate, but have to invite, because she's friends with BlahBlah and we'll never hear the end of it if she's slighted. Also, she'll probably show up even if she's not invited and make more if a scene than if an invitation had been extended. It's insane to me that Bosker is able to portray herself so objectively terrible... but she does. Everything about her own musings, experiences, and friendships made me want to hurl. Maybe I did, and just blocked it out. But the refrain of ""I was a big-wig journalist and gave it up to try this wine thing out because how hard can it be even when people dedicate their lives to it and I just want to drink"" is infuriating.

Lonely and dreamy, writing stories with younger sister Anne until dying at the too-young age of 30. Though I was introduced to her sisters in school (Charlotte in high school and Anne in graduate school), Emily was never prescribed reading. It's odd, because Wuthering Heights contains within it all the tropes, conflicts, and symbolism for which a classroom yearns. The story opens on our narrator as he decides to take up residence at what we'll call ""The Grange."" He subsequently walks to Wuthering Heights to meet his landlord, Heathcliff. Heathcliff a gruff, angry, asshole of a man, and the family dynamic at The Heights is confusing and piques the narrator's interest in a macabre sort of way. After an unplanned, nightmarish night spent at Wuthering Heights (which smacks of the attic in Jane Eyre and gets me wondering about how much the girls shared and, also, how much of their real lives they pulled into fantasy) the narrator begs the housekeeper at The Grange, Nelly, to tell the story of why Heathcliff is the worst.Luckily for us, Nelly agrees.We focus on Heathcliff as a child, the young Catherine currently living in Wuthering Heights, and our narrator's ruminations over it all. No character in this book, save Nelly, is truly likable. They are selfish and cunning and guarded. It makes them real. These people wander about, out for themselves, attempting to ruin others. Hareton, my favorite character, almost brought me to tears with how he is treated at certain points in the novel and, though most novels of the time had happy endings, Emily leaves a bit of a cloud over her characters once we leave them. It's a warning to watch out for yourself, and a reminder that people, despite how well you think you know them, can be so very cruel.

No, this Nix is a fantastical nordic horse which appears to children, beckons them onto its back, and then gallops them off of cliffs and to their deaths.That's only scratching the surface of how dark this book can get. Nathan Hill's narration style is completely immersive. His story shuffles through a few narrators: 1. SamThe main character, if we have to pick one. Sam gets two story lines: one where he is a pre-teen, before his mother leaves him, who meets twins Bishop and Bethany and becomes completely entwined in their lives. The other captures him at 30, floundering in the aftermath of his decisions, and having his mother thrust back into his life. 2. FayeA 17 year old in 1968, graduating high school, entering college, and attempting to balance what is expected of her and what she really wants in life. We get a brief glimpse into her mind ~18 years later, but this is where the meat of her story lives.3. LauraA vapid student of Sam's, who struggles with boys and school. 3.5. BishopWe only receive a smidge of his adult life in the military, but it is so poignant it deserves to be noted.4. PwnageA loner of a man who games with Sam in Elfscape (think WoW, without the copyright infringement), who is obsessed with the ""New Me"" who is sure to show up any day now.I run through these characters not because this is an opening of a play wherein you need these introductions, but because you need to understand just how different these characters are, and how masterfully Hill captures their unique voices. To go from a quiet, sensitive, regretful adult man to the self-absorbed neurotic rambling brain of a 21st century 18 year old girl to an obsessive, agoraphobic gamer to a 17 year old caught up in what, at the time, felt like revolution is astounding. This book is a case study in human nature, in what makes us feel, in what makes us whole. Books like this don't come around often, and I loved it all... except the very end.(view spoiler)[The ending, friends.Oh god the ending.The ending made me go ""wait, what the fuck, really??"" It reminded me of The Goldfinch in that, very negative, respect.Hill puts explosives up against the fourth wall in the last 30 pages. Sam goes up to Guy Periwinkle (his agent) and is all ""I'm going to write a new book, about all of this, about my mother, about Bethany and Bishop, all of it."" So he's basically going to write this very book.THEN he goes: ""and I'll be sure to give you a ridiculous name.""And Guy Periwinkle is a friggin' stupid name.So the end is this weird nod to the reader about how the book they're reading is the book Sam wrote and it gets meta in all the worst ways and pisses me off.So I look into Nathan Hill.Grew up in the Midwest.Wife is a professional musician.He's a writer (duh).His mother could have feasibly lived through 1968 and been of the age to experience all that Faye experiences and WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS BOOK NONFICTION?!And now that's all I can think about. And I'm fucking pissed about it. The book isn't ruined for me, but damn do I wish it had just ended on him and Bethany laughing, and everything else up in the air.Oh, oh, and PS. If Hill was going to put a neat little bow on all his characters at the end WHY DID HE TOTALLY FORGET ABOUT SAM'S POOR DAD?!

We jump from the world of the living as it spectates on Lincoln's grief, into a Purgatory Plane, where Willie struggles with what's become of him. The Purgatory Plane contains dozens of characters, most notable a Timon/Pumba sort of coupling in Mr. Vollman and Mr. Bevins, who are trying to help Willie, arguably to his detriment. And I didn't get it.I didn't get why the specters in the Purgatory Plane revealed themselves as weird caricatures of their deepest desires. I didn't get why we needed to meet SO MANY of the specters. I didn't get why Saunders even involved a historical figure in this story, seeing as how both Abraham and Willie Lincoln have very little to do with the story at all, and the main point seemed to be those who were already residing in the Purgatory Plane. I didn't find the story or the characters compelling, and I didn't like the ending. I guess I can see how this is a more avant-garde type of story telling, and I'll relent that it is original.

But while we're on the subject of Christie the person, we've got to visit the racism.And Then There Were None is the artist formally known as Ten Little Indians which was the artist formally known as Ten Little N**gers. I mean... she wrote the book in 1939 - she knew that word wasn't okay. America, to its credit, never published the book under the original title (though it did subscribe to the less-but-still-pretty offensive title Ten Little Indians). The reader should go through the book and take every reference to ""soldier"" and replace it with the aforementioned racial epithet - because that's how Christie wrote the book. The characters are on N- Island, people. I cannot morally reconcile this. While I enjoyed the story - finding it original and brimming with wit, Christie's preoccupation with ""otherness"" is jarring. The original title/name of the island isn't the only squeamish bit. She also makes snide comments about the Jewish community, the Asian community, and women. I am tired of making excuses for people because they were a product of their time. Christie was too contemporary to have that excuse applied, especially considering she lived in several countries and traveled around the world. That word wasn't okay in the SEVENTEENTH century - never mind the year my grandfather turned 15. Whew, I'm glad I got that off my chest. Disgust aside the book is, perhaps unfortunately in light of the above, fantastic. Creative, intriguing, psychological... it's a compulsive read. What's more: I couldn't parcel out the ending. Quite frankly, I don't know the last time a book stumped me. To have the ending dramatically revealed where I went: ""wait... what?!"" was truly lovely. So... I guess... read it?

Did he contemplate the human condition, find it wanting, and decide to write the most god-awfully-depressing series of words I have ever seen?...This isn't rhetorical.Safran Foer wrote my all-time favorite novel Everything is Illuminated. His second story about 9/11 was not as good, but still moving and well written. Eating Animals was a nonfiction attempt to understand the human relationship with animal products and, as a vegetarian, I really enjoyed his research. So why does Here I am suck so bad?The novel circles around a family: husband, wife, and their three sons. Recurring characters include the paternal grandparents, and the neglected family dog Argus. The family doesn't just have ""normal growing pains"" or ""difficult times"" - each character whose brain the reader peers into hates themselves and everyone around them. They are cruel, they are selfish, they are impossible to like. They aren't even fleshed out enough to truly understand them - the reader bases their impressions on the characters hate. And I just couldn't do it. I couldn't submit myself to ~500 pages of self-loathing and rage. After 200 pages, I skimmed through to see if they ever move past the ""I hate you and you and everything"" theme of the beginning of the novel. They don't.

The way Yanagihara wrote this book, I'm beginning to wonder if she was sitting around with her friends and they said ""bet you can't write the saddest book ever created."" And she took the challenge and fucking ran over the edge of the world with it.A Little Life follows four friends from early adulthood until middle age. First there is Willem, the sensitive pretty-type who wishes to be an actor. Estranged from his complicated family he seeks a family of his own making in his friends. Next, Malcolm. The privileged of the group who struggles with both his identity and sexuality while striving to meet his rich father's expectations without drowning under the weight of stuffing his square peg into the round hole of familial obligation. Third is JB, the dramatic, flamboyant, sometimes cruel and always passionate artist of the group. He's arguably the main foil in this novel. And, lastly, there is Jude. Jude is a thunderclap of sadness. He is the main character. He is the... protagonist? I guess? But after ~700 pages of Jude's self loathing I do not read him as a protagonist. In fact, the only character I consistently liked in the book is Malcolm. He's the only one who seems to grow up, while the rest of them flounder in Jude's past. To explain how and why every other character is utterly steeped in Jude (and I'm ignoring secondary characters like Harold and Andy and Richard and several others who are also swept away in the waves of Jude) would take dozens of pages worth of text. And maybe that was Yanagihara's main objective in crafting a novel as devastating as A Little Life. But I'm not buying it. I'm in the ""she made a bet she could write the saddest story"" camp. Because if you sat down and wrote out every single sad thing that could ever happen to a child, you still probably haven't thought up everything that happens to the character Jude. As we started to unfold Jude he became this delicate, beautiful, complicated character in literature. But as the book plodded on it Jude went from beautiful to infuriating and border-line ridiculous. The five dozen terrible things which happen to him start to become a caricature of trauma, and that is a truly terrible thing. By googling ""terrible things that can happen to someone"" and layering them on and on and on the character of Jude, Yanagihara has squandered an opportunity to detail how trauma can manifest itself in adulthood, and how it can radiate out to others. Instead, we're left with a mash of sadness which borders on ludicrous and that is a damn shame. (view spoiler)[PS. Willem and Jude getting into a relationship was friggin' infuriating. After all that time of being Jude's friend and watching him struggle, getting into a relationship with him was probably the stupidest and most unrealistic decision any of the characters make. And THEN she kills Willem off?? Seriously!? I just... no. At that point I had to place the book on the floor just to stomp up and down on it a few times before continuing.

I did not expect to become upset... or cry... listening to a man, who by all outward appearances has a better life than I, tell his story. Noah did not have the easiest time as a colored child being raised by a single black mother in the mid 1980s. Fear was a standard, and that fear merely evolved once apartheid ended. Domestic abuse, South African police and jails, growing up poor, growing up awkward... Noah isn't shying away from the dirtier aspects of life, and he does it in an earnest and open way. His story is important - it isn't Tina Fey joking about being friends with lesbians, or Anthony Bourdain chronicling his debauched youth.

Written by case prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi, the book begins the morning of the murders, working chronologically until the trial. Once there, the book becomes a tilt-a-whirl of past, present, and future, mixing Bugliosi's personal experiences with historical facts, creating a wholly immersive and subversive story.Growing up in the home of a corrections officer, I am no stranger to the cruel and unusual. The name Charles Manson was known to me at a (perhaps too early) age, and I read The Executioner's Song along with The Babysitter's Club. That being said, the blunt way in which Bugliosi writes shocks the narrative into a haunting tale of a sick-yet-articulate man, driven by madness and hate to twist young and broken minds to murder. It is unique and effective, allowing the actions and words of Manson himself to tell the story, rather than polluting the story with narrative flair or constructs. Sure, Bugliosi has ideas that are not based in stark fact, but the time he spent on this case, obsessing over such a mind as Manson's, gives him the right to some conclusion jumping.For anyone who is interested in law, order, madness, or murder, Helter Skelter is without doubt the book to read next. I tore through the book, audibly gasping more times than I care to recount.Bugliosi last updated this book over a decade ago, so those who want a complete story should do some Googling at the end. Good luck, and lock your windows, folks. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Dec 03, 2016","Dec 18, 2016","Nov 19, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/105992.Helter_Skelter

Driven by curiosity or a deep understanding of how a girl can be so completely controlled by a man, Cline writes The Girls: a clunky, boring narrative following the stumblings of a teenager as she dances on the fringes of the Manson clan.There is a difference between lyrical writing and smashing random adjectives and nouns together. Cline doesn't write poetry, she just writes weird.There is a difference between dynamic characters and characters who are one dimensional. You forgot a couple of dimensions, Cline.There is a difference between suspense and the 4th grade tellings of ""this happened, then this happened, then the orange tangerine couch of the sun split open with dew on my face."" Seriously, her metaphors are that bad/meandering and her story telling that plodding.I grew up with a law enforcement father who taught me about serial killers and self defense at a young age. I have read nonfiction and fiction about the most famous and grisly cases in America. If you are hoping The Girls will split open any murky underbelly you will be immensely disappointed.

When Gene Wilder passed away I felt a tug to know more about the man at the forefront of so many films which made me smile over the years.Mr. Wilder grew up, it seems, in a loving family. He had a rocky beginning at a military school, which may have severely marred his ability to make lasting, loving relationships. He struggled with his sexuality and worth. It's refreshing that he didn't hold back with his struggles: he is open about infidelity and longing, about illness, be it physical or mental. A lot of memoirs tidy up around the closets; Mr. Wilder flings them open, scars and all. I applaud him.While letting his freak flag fly, however, he also shows us how aristocratic he was. Mr. Wilder spends too much of the novel talking about the famous people who appreciated him, the expensive wine he drank, etc. It felt weird and uncomfortable for him to keep slipping in little nods to how rich and renowned he was.

Or, at the very least, explain to me what in the hell makes this book so special to all y'all.Like 9,000,000 other books floating around in the literary universe, Doerr tackles WWII. His spin is to have a 3 pronged story told in a nonlinear fashion. We follow Marie-Laure, a young, Parisian blind girl living with her single father; Werner, an orphaned German who is drafted into the Hitler Youth Academy; and the comically evil Major Von Rumpel, who searches for a famed jewel. The book is... fine? A blind girl is an interesting narrator, I suppose, but Doerr relies so heavily on the story 2,000 Leagues Under the Sea that her story begins to fray at the seams under the weight of laboriously long quotes from 2,000 Leagues. Werner is... okay? I mean, we've got way, way better stories out there detailing the horrors of Hitler Youth Academy (I can even tap my own family tree to get some of these stories). Bottling it up in an orphan background makes it more... original? I guess? But Werner doesn't really mature/change/do anything despite the reader following him from a small child up until he was 18-19. As for Von Rumpel, well, he's sort of ridiculous with how cloak-and-dagger evil Doerr writes him. And his ending is kind of pathetic.I guess I just don't get it. The writing is fine. The story is fine. But everyone seems to have worked themselves up into a lather about a book that seems to fall completely flat. (view spoiler)[My last complaint is Doerr ripping away all magic/supernatural aspects of the book with the death of Werner. He could have at least survived until he lost/passed on the stone. But for him to just get BLOWN UP while holding it is Doerr saying ""oh, yea, and by the way the stone means nothing KTHANXBYEEEE."" Oy. Vey.

If she is going to tell you about the ""Great Migration,"" she will leave no stone unturned and no story un-fact-checked. Contemporary journalists take note: this is how you write a story.Wilkerson's undertaking is mammoth: she is discussing an almost century-long mass movement of people escaping life in the South for a ""Promised Land"" in the North. She tackles sociology, psychology, economics... I mean, you're basically tapping into all the core classes you took in college. She quotes from newspapers and pamphlets and provides direct quotes wherever she can. The literal blood, sweat, and tears that created this book are obvious and written masterfully.Wilkerson tackles The Warmth of Other Suns by detailing the lives of three migrants: Ida Mae, the cotton picker who moves to Chicago; George Starling, the fruit picker who moves to NY; and Robert Foster, the doctor who moves to Los Angeles. She begins with their youths, and follows them until their deaths. The amount of time and care she puts into telling these life stories is obvious; toward the close she details going along on doctor visits and stopping by just for company's sake. Of course you bond with people you've interviewed for weeks/months/years, but Wilkerson is special: you can tell these people have become family. Gaps are filled with multi-year synopses, detailing the temperature of the country and peppering in stories from others she interviewed over the years.I was born in the 80s into the squeaky white suburbs of NY; I am woefully uneducated about integration and inner-city struggles.

Everything I know I've learned from Rent or Angels in America or just uncovered in passing when looking into something else. As a member of this society and this world, it seemed about time I learned about a disease which devastated tens of thousands of people during the 1980s.I expected it to be sad. I did not expect to walk away with so much anger in my heart. If we take Shilts word as gospel (which, spoiler alert, I do), there is a lot to be ashamed of. So many factions of the US government stuck their heads in the proverbial sand because no one wanted to come out as working on the ""gay disease."" American scientists stole and hid discoveries, the American media couldn't be bothered until AIDS struck the ""normal"" community (ie. heteros and celebrities), and the American people went about their daily lives as though there was no deadly disease ravaging their country. It may sound extreme, but Shilts is flexing his journalistic muscles on this one and backs everything up. I even asked my mother, who was in her 20s when this book takes place and basically lived on top of Manhattan (aka the epicenter for the disease), what she remembered of the AIDS epidemic.""Nothing,"" she said. ""It didn't affect me at all.""I can't read a single news article without seeing Zika on the side bar, and AIDS is far more deadly. It is both shocking and disgusting to me that it took until ~10 years after the first known death for the President of the United States to even acknowledge the disease existed. I cannot imagine the disillusionment and abandonment that must have vibrated through these communities. They were utterly let down by their country which should have protected them.This book can get a little dry in the more science-y portions, and it is incredibly dense (seriously, it took me a month and a half to finish because there was just so much information to take in, and all of it was depressing).

We all know the bare bones: There was a Revolution, a new country was born, then a bunch of men squabbled over how best to run it.What I didn't know was what delicate little flowers all of our founding fathers were. I mean, they flocked to newspapers to write scathing, semi-anonymous essays about one another, and stomped and pouted when they didn't get their way. Looking around, I guess that hasn't changed, but the important thing to note is that the faces of American politics haven't really degenerated either. Politics, it seems, attracts men with easily bruised egos. Alexander Hamilton begins at Hamilton's birth, and spans past his death, to see the end of both Aaron Burr's and Eliza Hamilton's lives. It tracks political tensions, international calamities, and the butt hurt barbs our founding fathers got all bent out of shape about. I kind of want a book consisting solely of the insults they threw at one another. I could spend all day quoting denouncements from this book, but I'll leave you with a personal favorite of Aaron Burr commenting on James Monroe:The man himself is one of the most improper and incompetent that could have been selected — naturally dull and stupid — extremely illiterate — indecisive to a degree that would be incredible to one who did not know him — pusillanimous and of course hypocritical — has no opinion on any subject and will be always under the government of the worst men — pretends, as I am told, to some knowledge of military matters, but never commanded a platoon nor was ever fit to command one — “He served in the revolutionary War” — that is, he acted a short time as aide de camp to Lord Stirling who was regularly drunk from morning to morning — Monroe’s whole duty was to fill his lordship’s tankard and hear with indications of admiration his lordship’s long stories about himself — Such is Monroe’s military experience . . .

In The Corrections you had the juxtaposition of Enid and Denise. One was a typical maternal housewife who kept herself a secret from her family so as not to upset them with the reality that she is actually a person. The other did the same, though less successfully and more promiscuously. At the time, I appreciated his honesty about the roles we attempt to force women into, and how they writhe, rebel, and destroy underneath those constructs.Now that I've read Freedom, I am less convinced. I think Franzen has some lady issues, and is working them out through fiction.Let's break down the characters, shall we?{IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT I HATE PRETTY MUCH EVERY CHARACTER IN THIS BOOK - READ WITH CAUTION}Patty is the worst. She reminds me of the Nirvana lyrics ""come, as you are, as you were, as I want you to be."" As in, every person in her life she claims to love as they are, then she claims that they have changed and were better before, then she accepts that she has idealized them, but still expects them to fit into the nice little molds she has created. She is manipulative and callous and I had absolutely 0 sympathy for her character.Connie defines herself by her relationship with Joey. She is depressive and utterly dependent on the man in her life. She says that multiple times, like the nanny in The Omen: ""IT'S ALL FOR YOU!!"". Ugh.Lalitha is purely a sexual object, and Carol and Jenna just aren't worth it to delve into. That leads me to Jessica, who actually seemed to have some layers to her. Unfortunately, despite devoting 461 pages to Patty, Walter, and Joey, Jessica does not get a single page for her own internal drama. I kept waiting for Franzen to give us a Jessica section. It never happened. Why introduce a family of four if one of them will be utterly left out of the script? It still makes no sense to me.What does it say when the only rounded out character gets absolutely no screen time? I can't tell you, but it makes me feel icky. Meanwhile, our leading men...Richard is a walking cliche: burned out artist with a string of women behind him who cannot create any real or lasting bonds in his life. The only relationship he can have is with Walter, and it's a tempestuous one at best.Walter is just sad. He's the beaten down guy you see in a relationship and you think to yourself ""I bet he could blossom if he just shook off the dead weight of his significant other and gave himself time to grow in his own skin."" I was equal parts frustrated, depressed, and flummoxed with his character. He is defined by Patty, even in the long passages where she is nowhere to be found. I'm hesitant to tackle Joey, because I just don't get him. What is he so angry about? What is he rebelling against? If we had his sister Jessica's side of things, it might make his childhood more sympathetic. However, we don't get any real glimpses into what it was like to grow up in the Berglund household, so we're just left to sigh and shrug. (view spoiler)[Also, the neat bow of his life in the end just felt rushed, and Franzen did not provide enough evidence to make his happy ending believable. (hide spoiler)]Franzen is highly observant when it comes to the Schadenfreude of the American upper-middle-class. It worked exceptionally well in The Corrections, but fell utterly flat for me in this novel. Who are these people? Why are they the way that they are? How do they reconcile or break under the realities of their malcontent by the close of the novel? These are questions I'm still asking, and it looks like I'll never get answers. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Feb 19, 2016","Mar 14, 2016","Feb 19, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7905092-freedom

We keep dipping back into that same well, convinced it will never run dry. This is because the events which happened all over the world at that time - the cruelty and struggle for survival and loss and pain - were unique for every person who lived through (or perished from) it. It is easy to be skeptical of WWII Lit. at this point (yes, WWII Lit. is a real thing and a college course you can take at universities with impressive Arts departments), and I'll admit I often am. At this point, new literature coming out on the subject is often so far removed from that subject that it loses heart. Night and The Diary of Anne Frank are all we truly need, for they are real, honest accounts. But we cannot rely on Frank and Wiesel for the whole picture; the war they suffered was theirs alone.Enter a veritable flood of historical fiction.Some of it is excellent and some of it is just terrible. Luckily for us, Kristin Hannah's The Nightingale is original and earnest enough to make it a truly gripping story.Hannah follows the story of fictional sisters Vianne and Isabelle and their struggle to survive the years in German occupied France (It should be noted that Isabelle is inspired by Belgium woman Andrée de Jongh, who risked her life to save felled airmen in France. She's pretty amazing. You should check her out). Isabelle plays the part of active resistance, while Vianne tries to keep her head down and survive. Both women are inspirational and infuriating, as only complete people can be. They struggle with their morality and what is responsible vs. what is right.Hannah does not shy away from the brute realities of what it was to live through WWII, and I thank her for that. Too much historical fiction glosses over the horrors to focus instead on love in spite of it all. Don't get me wrong, Hannah flexes her pen at this as well, but it plays second fiddle to the BIG PLOT POINTS: survival and loss.Is this book groundbreaking? Not in the least. But her characters are so heartbreakingly real and flawed and scared that it really doesn't matter. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Mar 02, 2016","Mar 11, 2016","Feb 08, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/21853621-the-nightingale

The focus on the news stations as they reported on the different crimes and goings-ons in Gotham. It felt very real. If superheroes were running around beating up folks in reality, we would absolutely have talk shows going back and forth between pro- and anti-Batman representatives. They would be talking less about the issues, and more about their personal/gut reactions to Batman the person. Miller knows how toxic the media is, and doesn't shy away from shoving it back in their faces.But that's really all I liked. The characters, the villains, the driving plot... it all fell flat for me. It felt tired. Perhaps Miller actually aimed for it to feel tired; again Batman is older in this story, so perhaps the fatigue we feel reading it is the fatigue Batman feels fighting his battles? But that is a gigantic stretch, so let's hazard a guess that this was not Miller's intent.

I'm not the biggest fan of Mr. Ben Stiller, but if he acted in dramas more I might just change my mind because I'll be damned if I don't watch that movie once a month......but I digress.I figured it was due time I read the short story which inspired the movie which inspires me. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty story edition bears very little resemblance to the movie, but that's okay - great, even, because it provides a different take on a person trapped in the mundane, and how they use their imagination to free themselves.The Walter Mitty of Thurber's creation is a spacey, married man. We watch him run errands on a typical dreary day, wishing he was anywhere but here. The story itself is incredibly brief, but I think that's important to the power of the story: this is Mitty's day-to-day; you only need a snapshot. At once bittersweet and moving, the juxtaposition of Mitty's imagination and reality echoes within any person with wanderlust. The important take-away, at least for me, is to make sure to balance your reality with fantasy. The story-version Mitty is deliciously vague, while the film version unapologetically breaks the cycle to seek adventure. There is merit, and beauty, in both. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jan 13, 2016","Jan 13, 2016","Jan 14, 2016",,Library Binding,view (with text),/book/show/3120995-the-secret-life-of-walter-mitty

I've wanted to slap Oprah Winfrey for her role in the creation of Dr. Oz for years - but reading how she elevated Jenny McCarthy has upgraded that slap to a sucker punch).Though this is a science book first, Mnookin writes with journalistic flair.

Jacked this up to 5 stars from 4. Locke & Key is the best graphic novel series, hands down. We can fight, it's okay.********************************************************************I just...**sigh**I really enjoyed the majority of Locke & Key. It was a totally original story telling a scary, intricate, sometimes horrifying, completely compulsive read. And the characters! Rufus was my main man (seriously, what a great character!), Kinsey was beautifully complicated, Bode was quintessential curious youth, and Dodge? Dodge was one of the most evil characters I've ever read... and I've read some messed up stuff.This last installment focuses around a few choice days, as Dodge makes his last-ditch effort to open the Black Door.My main issue with Locke & Key: Alpha and Omega is how dang preachy it got at the end. Everyone is making these sweeping speeches about mortality and spirituality. It was clunky and out of place with the rest of the narrative. I would have much preferred an abrupt ending, without all the hindsight-y monologues. (view spoiler)[Also, why did they have to kill 40+ students? It just felt heavy-handed and unnecessary. And insane. That's a freakin' massacre, and Hill hardly focuses on it because he's focusing on the ""death"" of Bode.And, hey, did they really have to burn down the dang house?? Were they worried about spin-offs or something?? It's always better when the creepiness prevails. To lose all those doors and magic was really tragic. I was more sad about the death of the house than any of the human deaths. I guess the whole thing with the animal door at the end was maybe a wink to the reader that the magic is still there... but I'm not holding my breath - that shit looks like it's gonna crumble. It was hugely disappointing to watch the house we've grown to love smolder.

I mean, she starts out when patriarch Patrick is a child for cripessakes - clearly this will not be a short-winded affair. I picked this book up due to my interest in the youngest Bronte, Anne. I find her to be so damn intriguing with her feminism and critical eye on religion and marriage - what sort of woman would stand up in the face of society and spit on it so resolutely?? According to Barker, an exceedingly lonely one.Barker is not romanticizing the Brontes in her book. She berates Elizabeth Gaskell for her slanted ""biography"" of Charlotte, and provides the most honest, no matter how brutal, account of each Bronte. Charlotte is angry and bull-headed and selfish and arguably a bully to her younger siblings. Branwell is a love-sick puppy who destroys himself. Emily is the day dreaming, isolating genius. Anne is the tight-lipped loner with a critical eye. They're not sounding too great, are they?The Brontes lived a rural life, with each other as their only company. Charlotte and Branwell made friends outside the family; Emily and Anne depended on one another. It's a tragic tale of four incredibly intelligent people dying before their time and fighting the peril of low-middle-class in the 1800s. Barker does an expert job of allowing the Brontes to speak in their own words, using hundreds of pages of their letters and diary entries. She finishes by fleshing out the world around them, allowing for fully-immersive story telling. If you're interested in mid-nineteenth century England and/or the Brontes, you really shouldn't go anywhere else but to Barker. Though this book made me think Charlotte was kind of a terrible person, I found myself thoroughly engrossed in her story, even after her other siblings had all died. It wasn't until Charlotte's own death that I began to skim the book a little (the last 100 pages or so). The Brontes isn't for everyone, or really for most people. It is a hefty book, and the attention to detail is so obsessive, you have to wonder if Barker has a spot of OCD. That being said, for someone like me, who got her Masters in English, and has always found the Brontes fascinating? I wouldn't have minded if it had been even longer. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Dec 23, 2015","Jan 17, 2016","Dec 23, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13581346-the-bront-s

And not necessarily in a good way.It's been mentioned before, but a lot of times the dialogue feels like it's pulling from the show. The 8th season is sort of an homage to the previous 7. Due to this, the overarching plot was uneven and got bogged down by the writers constantly trying to tie in the past. It's like they were jumping up and down yelling ""Hey! Hey guys! This is the BTVS you know and love! We promise! Look - they say 'five-by-five' and talk in all sorts of other Buffy-isms! Hey! Look over here!""Seriously. The reader gets beaten over the head with this crap, and it makes the actual story they're trying to tell clunky. As a whole, the season was entertaining, but I'll be brutally honest: even if it had been horrendous, I couldn't bring myself to hate it. BTVS saw me through some stuff when I was younger, and I haven't watched the whole series through 3+ times for no reason. But even I can only take so much abuse!Most of the terrible stuff would spoil the plot of the season (see hidden section for more), but one thing that won't is the relationship between Willow and Buffy. The two of them are best friends. I'll-love-you-even-when-you're-evil sort of friends. We're-more-like-sisters sort of friends. So the fact that the writers keep throwing in these weird homoerotic vibes between Buffy and Willow is offensive and biggoted. What, so now that Willow has been a lesbian for a couple of years Buffy is going to think about doing her? Just because Buffy is basically a super hero and Willow is around her all the time she wouldn't say no to rolling around in bed with Buffy? THEY'RE BEST FRIENDS. The writers clearly do not understand women, or just want to treat the comics like one giant Fan Fiction fantasy of ""what if everyone did each other all the time."" Yes, that's how season 8 came off to me, and it made me mad.(view spoiler)[Also, how the hell does this whole Twilight thing make sense? Whistler convinced Angel to become Twilight by simply saying ""uhhh, save the former cheerleader or save the world. heheh. I made a pop culture reference,"" and suddenly Angel is putting on a mask and threatening to kill people? And then he and Buffy sex a new universe into existence? How does that make sense? And the seed gives power/sucks out power to certain people for what reason I cannot comprehend (we won't even go into that heavy-handed metaphor because yuck). And then the sexed new universe appears to Angel as a lion and convinces him to fight Buffy? What???? IT MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE GAAHH.And then, the biggest kick in the balls is Giles. Not only do they KILL Giles - but Angel snaps his neck JUST LIKE HE DID TO JENNY?!?!?!?! I'm sorry, that's f#*&ing bull$#!%. How could Giles get his neck snapped by Angel after everything he's endured with that very Big Bad? I get it, it's the homage thing that the season kept shoving down our throats, but it's a cheap thrill which is inconsistent with the overarching story line. (hide spoiler)]I reserved judgement of the whole season until this installment, hoping that the finale would iron out all the awkwardness of the previous issues; but Last Gleaming was a big, stinking disappointment. Maybe season 9 will be better, but I've already read some homoerotic Buffy/Willow s&%! in that one, and I'm on page, like, 10. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Dec 07, 2015","Dec 07, 2015","Dec 07, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9792887-buffy-the-vampire-slayer

Interested to hear how dating has evolved over the past ~75 years? Do you just want to listen to the slightly nasal voice of Aziz Ansari during your morning commutes? Meet Modern Romance; the audiobook edition. I've watched his Netflix show and listened to pretty much all of his stand-up. There are quite a lot of parallels, and some blatant re-tellings between these three mediums. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but if you're already binging Ansari, give yourself a few weeks to refresh before diving into Modern Romance.Ansari breaks up the book into different categories: dating then, dating now, dating in other parts of the world, pros/cons of the dating evolution, his own dating experience, and a tidy conclusion which brings all of the points together, reminiscent of a high school essay (in an endearing way, I swear!). It's interesting and simple - popcorn for the brain where you actually learn something at the end!I really enjoyed when he spoke to how dating in places like Tokyo and Qatar differs so vastly from American standards/traditions. The sociological aspects of the book are well researched and will be great to use as party anecdotes. The rest of the book is just fun and funny... and, though not nearly as thought provoking, is an interesting glimpse into the internet dating world which I never experienced during my single life....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Nov 29, 2015","Dec 23, 2015","Nov 29, 2015",,Audio CD,view (with text),/book/show/23453101-modern-romance

Finders Keepers has a lot of echoes from Mr. Mercedes, and it can get a little tedious. The Plot: An author murdered, items stolen from his house, buried and forgotten. Years later, a young kid named Peter bumps into the items, and decides to use them in a way that at first saves, then tries to destroy him.Peter and his family aren't very believable characters. Peter is wildly mature and calculating, though there does not seem to be a good reason for this. In contrast, his parents are absolute morons. How did they get such a smart kid? Is he adopted? Is he the milkman's son? I seriously thought these things as I read.The character of Jerome makes a return, and King's attempt at ebonics, annoying in the first book, is positively infuriating in this installation. Jerome goes to a &$(#% Ivy League University, for Christsakes. Why would he think it'd be funny to have this incredibly racist alter ego?? Also, Jerome's relationship with Hodges is still weird, and his relationship with Holly borders on inappropriate to me. King may have given up on developing characters, favoring fast-action-plot instead. Because, yes, characters aside, Finders Keepers is a very easy and very tense read. It's very strange, though, to call this part of a trilogy. Yes, Hodges and his team are in this book, but really only toward the end. The book is more geared toward Peter and his story (as it should be); but Peter's story has only the thinnest of connections to Mr. Mercedes. The story was interesting, but followed the same exact formula as its predecessor, which was disappointing. Also, if King is still looking to hearken back to noir, he stumbled on this one. Finders Keepers is pure thriller. Basically, I wasn't planning on reading the third and final Hodges book......until the last page. I'm not going to spoil it, but if you want a continuation of the first book, just go into the bookstore, read the last page of Finders Keepers, put it back on the shelf, and walk away. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Nov 23, 2015","Dec 04, 2015","Nov 23, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23492589-finders-keepers

Probably doesn't sound terribly promising to the average ears. But, hey, I took more than one noir class in college, and have been reading Stephen King for almost two decades, so maybe if they run at each other hard enough they'll make something halfway okay?As you may be able to deduce, I didn't have terribly high hopes for this book. Noir, for me, belongs to Chandler and Hammett, and King has built a comfy little horror box he should stay inside.Well, color me embarrassed, because King can write noir wonderfully. He isn't breaking down the walls of the genre, which I suppose may ruffle some feathers. ""it's so contrived"" they may moan, or ""it's been done before"". Yeah... so? Any noir lover knows that the beautiful woman isn't what she seems, that the bad guy is really bad, and the good guy, regardless of his drinking and dark thoughts, is always going to be brilliant. I think King's decision to stick to the formula was perfect.So, as you may have already deduced, this story involves a detective and a bad guy. Hodges, recently retired detective, is whiling away watching Judge Judy and stretching the waistbands of his pants. On a day like any other, he goes to the mailbox, and has received a letter from one of the more notorious killers who got away on his watch.Cue 400 pages of action. I'm going to be straight with you: there are holes in this book. Jerome, the 17yr old across the street? Has no business being buddies with Hodges. Also, King has no business using the word ""shorty."" Seriously, King, knock it off. The killer, true to trope, is a walking cliche in a million ways I'm not going to get into because yawn and also because you can probably guess 250,000 of them. But man, I don't really care, because the pace of the book is great and Hodges is a perfect rendition of the hard-boiled detective and the character of Holly is just so damn intriguing.

I was waiting for the moment when the mom reveals she breast feeds to lower her fertility so she's less inclined to become pregnant again. But that reveal never comes. So yeah, gross city.And also that kid is going to become a serial killer. Room an interesting look into how a mind can be molded and subsequently shattered, and Donoghue does a great job at capturing how a five year old most likely thinks. However, these things don't make up for the fact that Room is a gigantic creep fest that doesn't really have a point other than to shock and disgust you.(view spoiler)[Also, the ending pissed really pissed me off. I mean, really? she's out of the room for, what, 3 weeks? A month? And they allow her to go into a halfway house to live on her own? She JUST tried to kill herself, people! She was JUST asked if her kid reminds her of her abductor! Any real-life psychiatrist/psychologist would NOT allow a woman who has been in a constant state of trauma for almost a decade to just skip out of the psych ward to live alone. Nope. Nuh uh. Not happening. She's going to kill herself and/or the kid. The ending is just this infuriating false happy ending, which begs the question: did Donoghue mean for it to be falsely happy? Is that her way of saying ""they'll never have a good life and always be struggling until they destroy themselves?"" Because if that's her message, she did a pretty terrible job. The way the book reads is as follows: you can go through these jaw-droppingly disgusting things, and in a mere month you'll be just fine and ready to start life again. Hooray!""

I pretty much wanted to burn Wild after reading it, because I walked away from that book possibly knowing less about the PCT than I knew before. Bryson, however, delicately and masterfully splices in juicy historical tidbits about the AT: it's history, it's hikers, and it's nature, while keeping us abreast of where he is at on the trail and how he is feeling. Katz can get wearisome (he is bewilderingly unprepared and his ability to act without thinking gets exhausting), but their time in the woods is beautifully written and made me want to try at least portions of the AT.So, yes, this book is great... except that I feel utterly betrayed by Bryson and his editors.I went into this book expecting him to hike hike all 2,000+ miles, and fairly early on he lets us know that, no, he will disappoint us, he is not going to hike the whole thing, but only pieces of it, because he's a yellow-bellied pansy who can't commit to what he started.That may be harsh, especially coming from someone who hasn't hiked more than 4 days straight, but it's like someone promised me a WHOLE CAKE, and then I just get a sliver of a piece.

Men interpret women in their art, while women are scorned for attempting to provide their own perspectives on themselves. This, Woolf cries, is unforgivable. All voices should be embraced, and the voice of Woman has been quieted for too long. The solution? Let women have some time to themselves and have some agency! These days Woolf's ideas are not revolutionary, but in 1929 it was borderline madness. For those of you unfamiliar with her work, Virginia Woolf writes some of the most beautiful, flowing prose published to date. You may think: ""how could an essay about women and writing work when Woolf's sentences meander about before landing on anything remotely resembling a concrete point?""Well, friend, see for yourself:""...And I thought of all the women’s novels that lie scattered, like small pock-marked apples in an orchard, about the second-hand book shops of London. It was the flaw in the centre that had rotted them. She had altered her values in deference to the opinion of others.""""...Masterpieces are not single and solitary births; they are the outcome of many years of thinking in common, of thinking by the body of the people, so that the experience of the mass is behind the single voice.""""...we must accept the fact that all those good novels, Villette, Emma, Wuthering Heights, Middlemarch, were written by women without more experience of life than could enter the house of a respectable clergyman; written too in the common sitting-room of that respectable house and by women so poor that they could not afford to, buy more than a few quires of paper at a time upon which to write Wuthering Heights or Jane Eyre.""""And again I am reminded by dipping into newspapers and novels and biographies that when a woman speaks to women she should have something very unpleasant up her sleeve. Women are hard on women. Women dislike women.""And this hysterical analogy on how men silence women:""...as if some giant cucumber had spread itself over all the roses and carnations in the garden and choked them to death.""Lastly, Woolf's wish for all women:""I hope that you will possess yourselves of money enough to travel and to idle, to contemplate the future or the past of the world, to dream over books and loiter at street corners and let the line of thought dip deep into the stream.""It's okay, you can swoon now. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,2,"Nov 12, 2022Jul 27, 2015","Nov 12, 2022Aug 06, 2015","Jul 27, 2015",,School & Library Binding,view (with text),/book/show/1359189.A_Room_of_One_s_Own

Like books about zombies and vampires, apocalypse books can be based around the dullest, most idiotic concept; but they still get pushed through on a wave of crap into our hands. Yes, sorry Ms. St. John Mandel, ""Station Eleven"" is an unequivocal wave of crap.Take the premise: the book opens up with a man whacking his hand (his HAND people. Not his head. Not his back. His stupid, insignificant hand, and he dies from it).Immediately after this confusing scene where you think ""wait, is that a misprint? did they mean head?,"" the surviving characters (aka the world) suffers an outbreak of the ""Georgia Flu,"" and everyone pretty much dies. Instantly. The book jumps around from 20 years before the apocalypse to 20 years afterward. It focuses on characters who died before the apocalypse even hit, to characters who have no recollection of what life was like beforehand. The author tenuously links all of her characters together. However, these links are wisps of nothing which disintegrate upon touching. That is: the characters aren't really linked at all, save for maybe passing each other on the street or talking to each other a little. It's totally stupid.St. John Mandel either cannot write characters, or is too lazy to put in the effort. None of the folks we meet along the way are fleshed out in any way. Their relationships are cliches, and they walk glaze-eyed through life without doing/seeing/being anything.Kirsten, the character we spend the most time following, keeps telling the reader that she remembers nothing from the first year of the apocalypse.

Nothing happens.In fact, pretty much nothing at all happens in all 300+ pages. You'd think in a post-apocalyptic world where the reader has been warned that people shoot first, ask questions second, that there would be some conflict. But not so, I'm afraid. This book is about a ton of people who survived the apocalypse, and some people who didn't, but you never really delve into their character, and you never witness real conflict/emotion.

Unfortunately, Morton is so damn hung up on secrets that she needs to package her ""mystery"" 3 times over before she's satisfied with it.It may be because I had already read The Secret Keeper, but everything was obvious from the get-go.

She watches in confusion and horror as this rich and privileged family spoils under the weight of servants and gold and opportunity.She does not last long.She is not dismissed by her second job, but is scandalized by the 18yr old daughter living in the house. Miss Murray is a manipulative little b*^$% who takes some pretty sadistic pleasure in hurting Agnes and bringing all the boys to the yard with her milkshake. Agnes suffers through, because that is what she's ""supposed to do,"" until tragedy strikes and she leaves her job of her own volition. What Anne is trying to accomplish in this story is staggering. She takes on religion, the role of women in society, how the upper class treats the lower classes... and does it all with a literary sarcastic eye roll. Seriously. That's how the book reads. Want some examples? Well, my friend, you're in luck.1. Miss Murray's journey takes a harsh look on how beautiful rich women stomp on those plainer, poorer, and/or of the opposite sex - but Anne isn't done there. She takes it one step further and unpacks the struggles of losing yourself in your husband and in having a child. The grief of losing your youth and the act of passing of the fun baton to the next generation - people get antsy when you bring that heavy crap up NOW - but Anne was ready for that conversation in the 1800s. 2. Anne's depiction of Hatsfield is a pretty brutal commentary on the corruption of the church. His cruelty to animals, his lecherous behavior, his disregard for the poor - all she needed to do was write in a scene where he's running around with a pitchfork poking his church goers to really bring the imagery home.Now, I've looked into some scholarship on Anne to try and beef up my final point, but have come up a little short. Few would agree, it seems, that Agnes herself is satire of the pious and proud. Popular opinion seems to lean on the notion that Agnes is a characterization of Anne herself - but I have to disagree. Yes, Anne was religious (but really who wasn't back then) and yes, she was a governess herself, and yeah, okay, I get it, she is popularly depicted as the sister who stuck to her place and yaddayadda - but I just don't buy it having read  Tenant of Wildfell Hall prior to Agnes Grey.Agnes in the first half of the novel reads almost like a caricature. Whenever anything happens, she prays rather than taking action. She is silent against her abusers, and everything just generally sucks for her. Even in the end, which is arguably happy, Agnes betrays no emotion to the reader, and ends with the line (I'm paraphrasing) ""and now I think I've said sufficient.""I actually laughed out loud at that last sentence. It's like Agnes is saying to us ""well, I've bored you enough with my story and I'm sorry for it."" Agnes actually cuts in multiple times to apologize to the reader for being emotional or rambling on about something that she actually cares about. I do not think Anne is doing this lightly. I believe it is her telling the reader that the overly pious, proud, and reserved, are doing themselves a disservice. What I take away from Agnes Grey is the notion of balancing your life. You shouldn't be a Miss Murray, but you shouldn't be an Agnes Grey either. A woman should possess the ability to reflect inward, rather than constantly worrying about the public view of the self. Miss Murray works too hard to flaunt and flounce, while Agnes attempts to fade into the background and be forgotten. Both think they are doing what is expected of them, and both are wrong. It reads to me as though Anne is challenging the women of her time to think before acting, and to grow a damned backbone.And now I think I've said sufficient. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Dec 13, 2015","Dec 22, 2015","Apr 22, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1155398.Agnes_Grey

Queenie is sickly, and in the failing light of life has been thinking on the time they spent together.The letter rudely awakens Harold from the dream-state of old age. Unable to sit still and process this information, he pops outside for a quick walk......which lasts for months. The tale is two-fold:1. Harold Fry and his wife Maureen separately reflecting on their lives; the mistakes, joys, sorrows, deceptions, miscommunications, jokes, and regrets. 2.

Joyce states that they talk... but does Harold know of Maureen's betrayal? Does Maureen know that Harold still needs her? It's never stated outright, which leads the reader to worry that both may slump back into the drudgery of life prior to Queenie's letter.Secondly, it would have been nice to hear more from Queenie. Oh, and for Queenie to know what Maureen did. For the book to close without Queenie knowing the truth actually made me mad. Thirdly, where the eff did the dog go?? Seriously, he just got on a bus??All complaining aside, this is a nice little book with quirky narration about a man and his feet.

How could I dislike (hate? I might even hate) this book so mThis may have been the worst book I have ever read.Ever.Like... including ""Twilight.""How? How could I dislike (hate? I might even hate) this book so much? It's about a woman disappearing, and another woman getting to the bottom of it. That sounds like a pretty sweet deal, and something totally up my alley.Allow me to elaborate. 1. This is neither a thriller nor a mystery. When you only have a cast of ~6 characters, it is stupidly easy to figure out who the bad guy is. The second the disappearance of Megan became a plot element, I knew who the murderer was. I had hope as I skimmed (yes, skimmed, I could not handle her terrible writing style to fully devote my time to it) toward the end that perhaps I was wrong; perhaps there would be a twist. But no. Like the train Hawkins leans on for imagery again and again, this book is a straight-shoot to the obvious. It never wavers and never changes course.2. Does Hawkins hate women? This is a serious question. The novel is written in first-person-narrative, varying from the points of view of three woman: a) A non-functioning alcoholic named Rachel. Her husband left her, she lost her job, and the author pens her as a pathetic slob who can't even be bothered to clean up her own vomit (literally). She ONLY fell apart because she couldn't have a baby and then her husband cheated on her. So, let me get this straight, dear author: Rachel's only value is being a wife and a mother? Take those away and there is nothing but a pathetic shell? Nice, real nice. Anyway, Rachel inserts herself into a missing person's case which, as far as she can see, has literally nothing to do with her. She lies, snoops around, and is generally a total creeper throughout the novel. She has zero redeeming qualities. She does not grow or change throughout the course of the book. b) A mother and wife named Anne. You want more to her character? Too bad. There is nothing else. Hawkins wrote her as mother and wife, full stop. Her sections revolve solely around her interactions with her husband and child. That's it. That's all. Like Rachel, she does not grow or change as the novel progresses. c) The missing person herself: Megan. She is in an emotionally abusive relationship and copes with this by cheating on her husband. She has baby issues and commitment issues. Like Anne and Rachel she has no job and no other personality elements other than her role as wife, lover, and potential mother. The only other women we have multiple interactions with are Rachel's roommate Cathy and a female detective who we know by her last name: Riley. Cathy is periphery: she hangs out with her boyfriend (and will readily ditch Rachel if her boyfriend is free and wants to see her) and she disapproves of Rachel's drinking. That's all we ever see of Cathy. As for Riley: she is a weird stereotype of a detective. She is a stony-faced woman-of-few-words who is weirdly suspicious of everyone she comes into contact with. None of her suspicions amount to anything, and she fades from view as the missing persons case goes from the capable hands of the authorities to the incompetent, clumsy, and infuriating hands of a non-functioning alcoholic (I bring the alcoholic thing up again because that is pretty much what defines Rachel. Hawkins is too lazy or too terrible a writer to give Rachel any real personality traits, so she just keeps hearkening back to the booze. Every single page in Rachel's narration makes reference to her wanting a drink, or drinking. Don't believe me? Go to the bookstore and flip through this trash for a second). I would classify the novel as follows:A book about how women need babies/husbands in order to define themselves. If they do not have these things, they spiral the drain of alcoholism and are generally unable to take care of themselves. Women without babies/husbands will insert themselves into married lives, and systematically try to tear apart what they so desperately want. I find Hawkins a deplorable person - to write her female characters in such a cardboard and vapid way when she is a woman herself? Are you serious? Who allowed this to be published? Hawkins trying to dress up her book with a half-assed, completely obvious ""mystery"" adds more insult to injury, because people (like me) expect intrigue. If you have read at least one other mystery/thriller novel in your life, you know who the bad guy is immediately, and spend the rest of the book reading about how much Hawkins hates women.The moral:Hawkins should not be writing, especially about women. If she hates herself so much she should go to therapy, and not cry on a soapbox to a confused, bewildered, disappointed, and even (in my case) outraged audience. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Mar 22, 2015","Mar 24, 2015","Mar 22, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22557272-the-girl-on-the-train

Holmes.Whenever I thought to myself ""why did he smoosh these two, pretty much independent stories together?"" I remembered this sentiment.Because really, that's what the story of the World's Fair and the story of H.H. Holmes are. Though they happened in tandem, one really has nothing to do with the other. It'd be like me telling the life stories of butcherman Joe and big-time-lawyer-guy Matt. Joe and Matt live a few blocks away from one another in Chicago, but they never interact, except that one time Matt came into Joe's shop and ordered some lamb chops. Reading something so disjointed simply because of coincidence is odd and, at times, tiring. Larson tries very hard to overlap the stories when he can, so gold star for that. He is also excellent at research. The diary entries! The block quotes! The attention to detail from menus at parties to ailments some players suffered from! ...but that gets sort of tiring as well. All of the businessmen who had a hand in the Fair? I could not have cared less which parts of them ached, or when/why they fell ill, or how they ultimately died. It was far too much information. I cared about two things: the Fair itself, and how creepy H.H. Homes was. And, I mean, Larson did deliver, albeit in a tidal wave of other information. I now know everything about the World's Fair. I know how many people entered the park on certain days, the most popular sites and buildings, what sort of food there was, how people ended up dying(!) at the Fair... it was exhaustive, really. And while I was thoroughly entertained at times, I myself also become thoroughly exhausted reading about the Fair in such meticulous detail.As for H.H. Holmes (cue dramatic music, a lightening crash, and the neighing of a horse), holy crap was he a scary man. Really, if someone cut out all of the World's Fair portions and came out with just the H.H. Holmes sections, this book would get an A+(+++), because I really really enjoyed Larson's retelling. Holmes is basically the devil: he has no remorse, he is an expert manipulator, and he is positively fascinating (and the ending! Oh, I will not spoil it, but what happens AFTER Holmes' execution gave me literal chills). I wonder if Larson felt the same way I do, because his Holmes chapters are so much more lively than his chapters on the World's Fair. I'm spitballing here, but perhaps Larson initially presented his editor with a short, H.H. Homes novella. Maybe his editor read over and was all ""Larson, baby doll, you gotta add some meat. You mention the World's Fair. Why not talk about that for a while?"" But Larson can't half-ass anything, so he provides us with everything and anything we could have ever possibly wanted to know about the Fair (I mean, seriously. Everything). For history and/or architecture buffs, this book is definitely a slam dunk. Larson is razor-precise, and his hard work shines through. But, if you're like me and you're just looking for an entertaining, historical read? The book oscillates between wildly titillating, and blandly daunting. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Apr 15, 2015","May 22, 2015","Mar 19, 2015",,Audio Cassette,view (with text),/book/show/21996.The_Devil_in_the_White_City

Reichl paints us a (blissfully chronological) portrait of what it was like to grow up in the 60s and 70s, while simultaneously taking us on her personal journey to a long-term relationship with food. The novel starts with Reichl as a child suffering through her mother's deplorable cooking (the woman managed to poison 100+ people at one party - eegads!), and ends as she begins to solidify her career in food writing. Though it relies heavily on the culinary portions of Reichl's life, the book manages to barrel through topical issues such as the mistreatment of the mentally ill and racial tensions through the eyes of Michigan during one of the most volatile times in history. It's peppered with the recipes of family and favorites, and reminds the reader of the magic of food; how it can take you to strange, nostalgic, and wonderful places with each bite. The only qualm I have is the last chapter. I can concede that this book is a victim of its time, but someone needs to cut the final pages. Seaturtles and shark fins? Really not okay anymore, Reichl.

Meet Ruth Reichl, a woman who love/hates her job/self, as she eats her way through New York City in the 1990s. Reichl, for those who may not be familiar with the name, was the NY Times food critic from '93 - '99. She has written several books detailing her relationship with food (personally, I recommend Tender at the Bone first). This particular novel focuses completely on her years working at the NY Times. Specifically, what she ate, how she liked it, and how her life was changed by the position.Reichl has to assume disguises, both internally and externally, to make it through her job. She has to ""suffer"" through being doted on when she is herself, and ignored when she is wearing her most convincing of costumes. Hilarious, heart-warming, and infuriating, this book runs the gamut of emotions for those of us who cannot afford to eat at crazy expensive/fancy restaurants.Personally, I have quite the relationship with NYC. Growing up so close to the city, I enjoyed my youth traipsing through the Village, Hell's Kitchen... pretty much anywhere which was off-beat and wouldn't drain my babysitting/college job $$. The types of restaurants Reichl talks about I'll probably never set foot in; not just because I could never afford them, but because a lot of them are no longer around. NYC is ever-changing, and the lifespan of a restaurant, especially a swanky one, is notoriously low. The affluent masses frequent a restaurant when it's new and exciting, then leave it to decay when the next big thing comes out. All that being said: don't read Reichl's book if you're looking for recommendations. You'll get them, but they won't necessarily by relevant.Instead, read Reichl's book to get a glimpse of what NYC was like in the 90s. Watch as Times Square morphs from a seedy area best avoided to the epicenter of tourism. Read it to immerse yourself in a love affair with food. Reichl, despite her griping about her job, loves food and the passion good food reveals. The recipes she tucks at the end of her chapters, and the fervor with which she recounts some of the best meals of her life are intoxicating.Though the passion and writing are good, Reichl clearly dates and prices herself and her food choices in this novel. Truffles? Bitch please. Foie gras? As if. Though she does paint herself as ""one of the masses,"" it is clear that Reichl exists within the upper-echelon of people; eating the most pretentious food imaginable in excessive quantities. It's also tiresome to listen to Reichl bemoan the difficulties that come with your job requiring you to eat out at the most expensive restaurants in the world for free. We feel you, Reichl......Seriously, though, Reichl's book is a great snapshot in time of the food scene in NYC in the 1990s. If you love food as much as I do (which my well worn kitchen would tell you is A LOT), then you'll love this book, despite all the gold that glitters out of reach. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Oct 05, 2015","Oct 18, 2015","Mar 19, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/80642.Garlic_and_Sapphires

Her short story collections are the prime example of this, though her first full length novel, ""The Namesake,"" did not disappoint or lead the reader to believe that Lahiri was solely a short story writer.Unfortunately, ""The Lowland"" had me wishing it was 300 pages shorter.The story is so Lahiri-esque: two brothers, born close together but of quite opposite dispositions, grow up. We see them first as children in the 1960s and close the novel in the winter of life, in the unnamed future (presumably either present day or even further into the future after the book was published). We twist through major events in Indian history, and watch how each character reacts. There is love and loss and disappointment and compromise. As the book goes on and the narrative progresses, the story becomes less linear. It is reflective of a true aging mind. Things become less concrete, time flows more freely between past, present, and future. In short, it's fantastic.That being said, the story itself plodded along, never exciting me or touching me. The characters are just so dang sad and have made such terrible decisions in life. What's more, even though they are cognizant of these decisions, they do nothing to change their situations or make things right. It's infuriating, and if I didn't have such a love of Lahiri's other work, I probably would not have finished the book out of sheer frustration. The prose themselves, as I have already said, are beautiful. But that is not enough. I need characters I care about and am definitively rooting for or against. Instead, the reader is introduced to what I would call ""gray characters;"" characters which settle into their ruts, no matter how uncomfortable, and never move or change. In a way, this was like the Indian take on ""American Pastoral."" I did not much appreciate that story either. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Apr 13, 2015","May 05, 2015","Mar 18, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17262100-the-lowland

The only times I remember sitting down at 11:30pm and watching SNL were on the weekends my brothers and I stayed at my Dad's. It was this special bonding time between a Dad and the kids he doesn't see often. We'd stay up late, cracked out on buttery popcorn and chocolate goodies bought from Costco, and laugh even at the unfunniest of sketches, happy to be up past bedtime and happy to be with each other.In adulthood, I only pop onto Hulu to stream last Saturday's episode if:1. an actor or band I really like was involved2. the internet is exploding from how funny/whacky the episode wasWhy, then, would I even bother with this book? And how did I end up liking it so much?Miller and Shales aren't simply interested in the funniest sketches and the most destructive people which/who have danced across the stage. Rather, they treat this book as a march through eras of comedy and culture, beginning with the drug-infused 70s, and ending on the granola-and-kale early 2000s. They capture the most touching, the most hilarious, and the most cringe-worthy moments, and they allow every person who has walked into 30 Rock to tell their story.The structure is pretty fascinating (and I can't even begin to fathom the amount of editing that went on, whew!). Miller and Shales interviewed everyone they could get their hands on, and had these actors/writers/produces/passerbys tell, in detail, the life of SNL while they were there. Once each story has been collected, they are systematically hacked up and sprinkled throughout the book into bite-sized paragraphs, so that the readers get a chronological story; and get several views on the same event all at once.Really, really ingenious stuff going on here.The authors were able to nab pretty much all of the heavy hitters (save those who had already passed, and Eddie Murphy. Really, Eddie Murphy? You're too good for this shit? Nevermind the show, you know, made you who you are today but whatever, fine, be that way), [{[{HELLO! IT'S ME FROM THE FUTURE! 2020 to be exact. A good friend told me she was reading this, so I got nostalgic and decided to re-read my . All I have to say is... wow. Girl. Do some Googling. Eddie Murphy had to deal with SO MUCH RACISM during his tenure on SNL. It isn't surprising he passed on being a part of this book. Be better. Anyway, back to the 2015 }]}] and, surprisingly enough, were able to get some pretty honest takes on how SNL has evolved, who has been the best (and the worst) to work with, as well as some pretty great behind-the-scenes looks. I laughed out loud, I gasped a bit, and my feelings on some actors will never be the same (I never thought I'd dislike the guy who brought me ""Zoolander"" and a very good reboot of ""Walter Mitty"" ... but I sort of want to punch Ben Stiller in the throat after finishing this). The only negative I really have to say is: the final section on Lorne Michaels? Super unnecessary. Super boring. I found myself a little annoyed with the writers that they slapped it in here, and really only skimmed the end, looking for final anecdotes from the voices I liked the most.For anyone who appreciates SNL, or comedy at all for that matter, this book is quite simply a must-read. I was interested in this book solely to hear the voices of Akroyd, Curtain, Murray, Fey, Fallon, and Poehler (comedic icons, in my book), but I walked away having respect for so many more past cast members/writers, and respect for the sketch show that has survived so much, and just keeps truckin'....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Mar 11, 2015","Mar 13, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55095.Live_from_New_York

Bourdain, though respected as a good chef (unlike those he shares the screen with: Ray, the ""Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives"" guy... **shudder**), is bossy, overly opinionated, and just grates on me.I clued my Father into my thoughts on Bourdain. ""Have you read his book?"" he asked. ""Well, no..."" ""Get back to me when you have.""All I have to say now is: damn.Bourdain isn't a dick - he's just annoyed. And, in my amended opinion, rightfully so. Bourdain grew up a privileged jackass who, upon graduating from the CIA, felt he was too good for anything but a chef job. He subsequently bopped around from sinking ship to sinking ship, dealing with thieves, savants, and idiot savants......and lived to tell the tale.He has waded through the more sewer-y corners of the restaurant world. He has worked with incredible people, big-headed people, criminals, rubes (reds? blues?). He has been seduced by drugs, resisted the seduction of the more greasy-palmed aspects of the business, and has unabashedly laid all of this out for his readers.The man has balls.I relished this book. I ripped through the pages like Bourdain ripped through his food. His ""here was my experience, love it or hate it"" approach deserves a standing ovation. I generally loathe memoirs for their squeaky clean, the-badness-swept-under-the-carpet take on life. Especially when we're dealing with someone in the public eye (I'm looking at you, Gilbert. I would burn every copy of ""Eat, Pray, Love"" if I wouldn't feel badly about burning a book). Bourdain knows his honesty is equivalent to playing with fire, and mentions it over and over again in his book (mentioning the book may get him canned, mentioning that he won't provide real names lest he get his head smashed in). He is honest and unapologetic. What's more: I was astonished at how humble this book comes off. The chapter ""The Life of Bryan"" brought this book from great to I'm-going-to-be-recommending-this-to-everyone-always. To approach your book as ""this is what the industry is like. Here are all the disgusting, illegal, sexist, and racist things that go on,"" and then turn it on it's head to say ""Stephen Bryan is a better chef than me, has had a totally different experience that is arguably disgust/sexism/racism free and totally legal and I'm an idiot"" (he actually says that. He breaks the fourth wall and chastises himself with: ""Wrong again, idiot!"" I loved it). How can you not walk away from this book admiring Bourdain and his honest love for the food and the craft?I will read this book again - when I need a good laugh or a reality check. Bourdain is not a writer and he knows it. But his passion for what he does allowed for this book to essentially write itself, and masterfully so. Step away from the computer, trot on down to the nearest library, and hunker down with Bourdain for a few hundred pages.

They're taking Philosophy 101 and have convinced themselves that they are on a higher plane than the consumer-obsessed mongrels who plague the world. Wallace, it seems, never grew out of Freshman pretension. Partially from mental illness and partially from isolating himself, Wallace remained convinced of his superiority, and funneled all of his ""brilliant"" frustration into 1000+ pages of dross.I can say that Wallace's book is good for something, though I'll rally against those who insist his work is a ""defining"" one, or, worse still, that those who cannot grasp the beauty of ""Infinite Jest"" simply aren't enlightened/deep/clever enough (try high enough) to understand it. Honestly, the book would be brilliant if it had some cohesion to it. And hey, if Wallace truly wanted to pen a novel which just rambled and pithered about, he should have at least achieved beautiful prose. Yes, at times Wallace does hit on some poignant passages. But these passages ring more like that ""monkeys with typewriters"" scenario than of actual talent/genius.Wallace's book deserves to exist because it makes for a great case-study in mental illness. The broken, fragmented narratives of each of his characters speak not of the people he's made up, but of the person who resides within Wallace himself. ""Infinite Jest"" is a testament to Wallace's mental illness, and to how America treats mental disease. It illustrates how we naively attempt to combat it, as well as how our lack of education can affect both individuals and the globe. Is it a masterful work? Bitch please. But it'd be worth teaching excerpts in psychology classes. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"May 22, 2015",not set,"Jan 28, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6759.Infinite_Jest

Luckily, the dysfunction I grew up in allowed me to feel part of the family Lambert, rather than looking in and thinking ""damn, guys, your lives really suck.""Allow me to explain.This 500+ page book circles around The Lambert's, a family of 5 in the autumn of their lives. Enid and Alfred, the elderly, midwestern parents; Gary, the ill-tempered oldest with a propensity to be petty and jealous as he wades through his unhappy marriage; Chip, the floundering middle child who manages to ruin every venture he undertakes, and never seems to settle down; and Denise, the youngest who simultaneously attempts to keep the family together while also trying to salvage some semblance of herself.Whew.The book structure alone is something to be appreciated. The book focuses on one slim time period: October - December of a single year, and is then broken up into 6 sections: one section for each character (with Enid and Alfred sharing their section), a section where they all attempt to get together for Christmas, and the epilogue. I found this an excellent way to tell the story of the Lambert's: you are introduced to each character in depth, focusing on a mere couple of months, with a hefty amount of flashbacks to flesh out how the character got where they are now. All the while you know you are hurtling toward the Enid proclaimed ""One Last Christmas,"" where the family may or may not finally get together, where the fate of the sick Alfred will be hopefully be decided, and where the reader will discern whether each character was able to achieve the corrections they so desperately wanted in their lives.Franzen is unforgiving in how toxic a seemingly conventional family can be. The sibling anger, the pouty disapproval of a traditional midwestern mother, the cold and silent father who suddenly finds himself needing his family... these are characters that exist so readily in life, it would seem that this story would not need to be told. However, Franzen artfully crafts their internal monologues, fleshing out the fears and insecurities of even the most outwardly stable of people. I laughed out loud and teared up. I finished the book, shocked at how well it ended, while wishing that there was more. To close, and at the risk of fan girling: Franzen's ""The Corrections"" is a flawless case study of an American family at the dawn of the new Millennium, and really should be read by you....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,Feb 2015,"Feb 21, 2015","Jan 28, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3805.The_Corrections

Cheryl Strayed was the same age I am now when she tackled this aA book I probably never would have read had I not received it as a Christmas present. Cheryl Strayed was the same age I am now when she tackled this adventure. Though I am outdoorsy myself, I really felt nothing either way about delving into her story. Holding this book in my hands before beginning I thought to myself: ""Please, oh please don't be as bad as 'Eat, Pray Love.'""Well, it wasn't. But shit was it close.Cheryl Strayed has a shitty life. Her mom dies from cancer, and in response Strayed slams on the proverbial Self Destruct button of life. Cheating on and ultimately divorcing her husband, dropping out of college (though she does not describe it this way, there is no other way in which to quantify a person who simply did not complete the requirements of their university), doing heroin, working dead-end jobs... she has no forward no momentum and nothing going for her. So she makes the (arguably flippant) decision to hike the California portion of the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT).Though she states she prepared for the adventure for roughly six months before setting off, she is woefully unprepared. She doesn't understand how shoes work, she packs way too much stupid stuff (carrying more than one novel, a foldable saw, a roll of condoms), and doesn't pack things one might actually need for such a trek (suitable water containers, suitable clothes... oh and money). Reading this book I became alternately flummoxed and sympathetic. Yeah, it takes some serious balls to do this in the first place, but did she have to be so damn stupid about it? Sure, she was young, but she was the same age I am now and, having done multi-day hikes (though nothing close of this length) I know for a fact I would never have made some of the ridiculous decisions she does in the story. The way she wastes money on frivolities and relies on the kindness of strangers is maddening. I know perfectly well that a trek such as the PCT attracts a certain type of person (friendly, selfless, etc.), but even still, Strayed never would have made it through the hike without several of the characters in the book pushing her on.Oh, and hey, Strayed can't write well. She keeps mentioning in the book how she wants to be a writer and will be one day (we'll ignore that it took her the better part of 20 years to actually get this book done and out, but whatever). But for all her self-congratulatory bullshit, the reader is met with lines like (when discussing her mom begging her male nurse for morphine) ""sometimes he told her no in a voice as soft as his penis in his pants"" and ""It was Friday morning and I could feel the Friday morningness emanating from the houses I passed."" My personal favorite is: ""I got an abortion and learned how to make dehydrated tuna flakes and turkey jerky...""For someone who talks about the death of her mother for more than half the novel, it is shockingly uncharacteristic that the abortion she has right before the start of her trip boils down to four matter-of-fact words. It makes me feel like, despite telling us about all of the random sex she had and all about her naked body, she refuses to divulge about something really significant in her life. Really?Strayed chooses to repeat things. A lot. Phrases, ideas, sometimes almost whole paragraphs. This works in novels with astounding prose, or in books of incredible length. It does not work here. It feels lazy, like she approves of how she described something once so she repeats it again. And again. And again...The book is less about someone hiking the PCT, and more about someone running away from their life and reflecting back on it as they build themselves anew. The retrospective narrative Strayed uses is clunky at best, and I found myself annoyed with her as she mentioned her mother for the 70th time, her step-father for the 58th, her poor ex-husband for the 49th.There was one part of the novel that particularly pissed me off. Strayed is reflecting (for the zillionth time) on her mother; thinking about how her mother didn't push her to apply to colleges. Insinuating, basically, that had her mother pushed her harder, she would have gone to Harvard:""But it was too late now, I knew, and there was only my dead, insular, overlyoptimistic, non-college-preparing, occasionally-child-abandoning, pot-smoking, wooden-spoon-wielding, feel-free-to-call-me-by-my-name mom to blame.""Dude... seriously? It's you dead mom's fault you didn't go to an Ivy? Plenty of parents (my own included) do not help their children pick out universities. It's your future, take the reins yourself. It is not your dead mom's fault that you were a lazy teenager who did not do the research, did not discuss your options with a teacher/guidance counselor, and ultimately coasted through a meh college that you didn't even graduate from. Shit happens in life. Some people make the best of it. Some people dick around. So... way to dick around. I could have done with more descriptions of the places and trails and people; less of her ruminating on her bad decisions and bad life. All-in-all, Strayed is infuriating, and the book is best enjoyed skimming for the (seldom few) parts that have to do with hiking the PCT....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jan 28, 2015",Feb 2015,"Jan 28, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12262741-wild

Maybe her editor was oThere is this sneaking suspicion in my head that Amy Poehler's editor didn't come into work on the day the booked was finished. Maybe her editor was on a vacation for weeks and came back to a manuscript that was due to go to print a mere few days later. Poehler does tell us over and over again that she dreaded writing this book and dragged it out as much as she could, so it honestly wouldn't surprise me that she delivered the final product late, so that it was ed late, and thus the whole process was rushed.The reason I think this is quite simply because most competent editors would not have allowed this book to be printed. It rambles and repeats, and when I say repeats, I mean I read some long anecdotes 2-3 times over only a couple of chapters apart. It is glaringly obvious that Poehler wrote this in chunks whenever inspiration struck and did not read it through once she had enough to fill a book. There is no cohesion to the sections. Instead the chapters have been Frankenstein-ed together as they jump around space and time. The reader is hurtled from present day to childhood to Poehler's early 20s to Poehler's SNL hey-days and back. She writes like she would talk to you: beginning one story, then meandering off into a second, launching into a third, referencing the first again, beginning and completing a fourth story, completing the second story, and never quite letting you know what the point of the third was. It was a little maddening at times, and I found myself thinking over and over ""oh, hun, no one told you to re-read your work, did they?""All the technical criticisms aside, this book was an entertaining memoir about a woman finding herself and attempting to tackle happiness. Part self-help book and part ""this one time at band camp,"" Poehler's book is unapologetically honest about the mistakes and weird turns life takes, while simultaneously attempting to bolster any woman who may find herself in unsavory, unhappy, or just plain unhealthy positions. Poehler nestles nuggets of truth and inspiration in her otherwise erratic ramblings, and there were some parts that made me want to punch the air in solidarity - for Poehler knows the struggle of being a woman criticized for her personality, her looks, her priorities. Even the majority of us who are not and never will be famous can appreciate passages such as:""We didn’t take a lot of pills in my day, which was lucky. Those suckers are heart-stoppers. It’s scary today to see all those downers find their way into young people’s hands. Teenage bodies should be filled with Vonnegut and meatball subs, not opiates that create glassy-eyed party monsters.""And my personal favorite ""self-help"" excerpt from her book (as she discusses struggling with loving yourself for who you are and what you look like):""Hopefully as you get older, you start to learn how to live with your demon. It’s hard at first. Some people give their demon so much room that there is no space in their head or bed for love. They feed their demon and it gets really strong and then it makes them stay in abusive relationships or starve their beautiful bodies. But sometimes, you get a little older and get a little bored of the demon. Through good therapy and friends and self-love you can practice treating the demon like a hacky, annoying cousin. Maybe a day even comes when you are getting dressed for a fancy event and it whispers, “You aren’t pretty,” and you go, “I know, I know, now let me find my earrings.” Sometimes you say, “Demon, I promise you I will let you remind me of my ugliness, but right now I am having hot sex so I will check in later.”""This book is best read before you go to sleep. Consider each chapter their own short story, and read them far apart from one another. The repetition and randomness of the whole ""book"" will feel less jarring and more cute and quirky, just as Amy Poehler and her fictional counterpart Leslie Knope so naturally are. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Feb 19, 2015","Feb 25, 2015","Dec 22, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/20910157-yes-please

I thoroughly enjoyed Card’s dystopian society, ravaged by war and overpopulation; his dramatic irony, as the adults drove the children further into rabbit holes; and the nod to a future that, in many ways, mirrors current reality.Ender, though not the most believable of fictional children, was an excellent narrator; his fears, hesitations, and insecurities made for a compulsive read, and the ending gelled nicely with the ideologies which the author thrust on someone so young. Card gives us a bleakly real view into humanity’s savageness, that “eye on the prize” mentality that runs over the weak and sheeplike. Yet, impossibly, Card simultaneously reveals how completely beautiful some of humanity can be. He uses “us vs. them” to perfection, and I commend him for the larger issues of race and power that he tackles .My only complaint is that I could have used more chapters fleshing out Peter and Valentine. I was very invested in that subplot, and it felt like an abandoned half-baked cake. It’s as though Card realized their story could encompass an entirely separate novel and thus dropped it in favor of focusing on Ender. I get it, I really do, but I could have handled an extra 200 pages to better appreciate where they both end up at the close of the book. I would argue that this book should be taught in schools. I appreciate the tropes now, but would have devoured them at age 13.

That's what Suzanne Collins does with her final installment of The Hunger Games trilogy. Over the course of just ~13 months, Katniss Everdeen went from a poor, pithy survivor getting by in her mining district, to a national symbol and a key player in a revolution. She wants none of this, and understands very little. She just wants to keep on living, along with the few people she loves. This is, first and foremost, a book about war. We get description of weapons and battles and strategy. This usually isn't my cup of tea. I don't like war, and I don't like books that belabor it. Luckily, Collins consistently focuses on the human part of war: the injured, the innocent, the bewildered... she wants her readers to think concretely about the cost of war. To package this in a YA book was a bear of an ambition, but she does it with skill and grace.Now, look, Mockingjay isn't perfect. Collins does Finnick and Johanna dirty.

Side adventures abound as terrifying, heartbreaking, and white-knuckled events shatter his course again and again. I'm happy to report that the ending is quite satisfying.

But, don't worry, America's English curriculum isn't broken. We're fine. #Englishclasssowhite.This book isn't not good, it's just that magical realism isn't exactly my cup of tea. So when the ghost in house 124, which I assumed to be a metaphor for grief, turned out early on to be an actual ghost, I was like oh, shit, that's where this book is going.For the 3 other people who haven't read this book: Beloved follows Sethe, a woman who escaped slavery and has been living in Ohio ever since, in the house of her late mother-in-law, with her one remaining child. Early on, the reader knows that Sethe and her family have suffered significant tragedy, but the book reveals the extent of their pain in bits, peeling back the scar tissue thin layer by thin layer. Morrison is a master when it comes to the nuance of trauma, and those parts of the book had me gasping, tearing up, grateful that such a writer exists to pen so beautifully some of the horrors that were inflicted on people in the name of ""discipline.""That said, a cool 50% of the book isn't about that, but about the ghost in the house. And I just... really didn't like that. I didn't find it engaging; it felt like a distraction from the narrative of Sethe and Paul D in their earlier years. And, while lyrical stream-of-consciousness is usually my jam, the instances of this in Beloved fell flat for me. (view spoiler)[And, listen, I get that Beloved, both in baby ghost form and in adult humanoid form, is a physical representation of maternal love and fear and passion, and how that can metastisize and destroy. Also, I'm aware that Beloved is the catalyst for the unpacking of some Sethe's trauma. Please don't @ me that I ""didn't get it."" I did. But, again, the Beloved aspect of the book just wasn't my cup of tea.

What was the point of it all?Woolf tackles mental illness in the characters of Septimus and Lucrezia, lesbianism in the characters of Sally and Clarissa, imperialism and infidelity in the character of Peter... these are popular tropes now but in 1925? Not so much. Scandalous, even.Mrs. Dalloway is a classic which bears no introduction and needs no analysis - dissertations have been written on the subject, so who am I to bore you with my thoughts? Let me leave you instead with Woolf's own words:One cannot bring children into a world like this. One cannot perpetuate suffering, or increase the breed of these lustful animals, who have no lasting emotions, but only whims and vanities, eddying them now this way, now that.For she was a child, throwing bread to the ducks, between her parents, and at the same time a grown woman coming to her parents who stood by the lake, holding her life in her arms which, as she neared them, grew larger and larger in her arms, until it became a whole life, a complete life, which she put down by them and said, “This is what I have made of it! This!”Sally stopped; picked a flower; kissed her on the lips. The whole world might have turned upside down! The others disappeared; there she was alone with Sally. And she felt that she had been given a present, wrapped up, and told just to keep it, not to look at it — a diamond, something infinitely precious, wrapped up, which, as they walked (up and down, up and down), she uncovered, or the radiance burnt through, the revelation, the religious feeling! — when old Joseph and Peter faced them:“Star-gazing?” said Peter.It was like running one’s face against a granite wall in the darkness! It was shocking; it was horrible!But she feared time itself [...], as if it had been a dial cut in impassive stone, the dwindling of life; how year by year her share was sliced; how little the margin that remained was capable any longer of stretching, of absorbing, as in the youthful years, the colours, salts, tones of existence, so that she filled the room she entered, and felt often as she stood hesitating one moment on the threshold of her drawing-room, an exquisite suspense, such as might stay a diver before plunging while the sea darkens and brightens beneath him, and the waves which threaten to break, but only gently split their surface, roll and conceal and encrust as they just turn over the weeds with pearl.And the most poignant of all, considering the end of Woolf's life:Death was defiance. Death was an attempt to communicate; people feeling the impossibility of reaching the centre which, mystically, evaded them; closeness drew apart; rapture faded, one was alone. There was an embrace in death....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Mar 14, 2016","Apr 11, 2016","Oct 29, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/14942.Mrs_Dalloway

I chose this particular book because ""the defining years"" sounded like an excellent place to start, I was interested in the beginning of her career, and Cook has received nothing but praise for her writings.Well color me disappointed.This book covered way too much of Eleanor's personal life. Hundreds of pages were dedicated to her alleged romance with journalist Ms. Hick. I had to read far too much about the woes of her children and her dinner parties and I felt robbed. Like I said - this isn't fair. This book gave a COMPLETE history of the times. What Eleanor ate, wrote, thought, loved, experienced, etc., and that was simply not what I wanted. So yes, I concede that just because I wanted a shorter book that focused primarily on the political times rather than the types of dresses Eleanor went shopping for doesn't mean this book was bad. And it wasn't bad. Cook was very thorough in her research and the bits that actually focused on policy and America were excellent. But that's all they were: bits. I skimmed whole chapters searching for the relevant bits and leaving out the ""no, you hang up first"" letter equivalents which Eleanor kept with Ms. Hick.So really all I have to say is this: I apparently do not care about Eleanor the person, I care about Eleanor the social legend....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Oct 26, 2014","Nov 24, 2014","Oct 24, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/78518.Eleanor_Roosevelt_Volume_2

MoriaIt seems weird to call this ""chick lit"" when it tackles issues like domestic violence, rape, murder, bullying, and infidelity; but there you go. Moriarty has penned the darkest beach read I have ever encountered. She barrels through the upper-class life of a group of Kindergarten moms and addresses everything from fashion faux pas to murderous rage. I think she provides an accurate and clear voice for all of her characters: children, teenagers, tired old moms, terrified young moms, bored moms, rich moms (red moms? blue moms?) but you get my drift. She was able to rile my emotions during the more harrowing scenes and she reminded me of when my own little brothers were bullied in school (and, yes, I did believe myself capable of murder back then).All of this being said, the whole thing felt a little, well, cliched. Each character's baggage was expected and worn; like the beat up duffel bag abandoned at the airport. I found myself audibly sighing at times, and becoming angry with the characters (and, subsequently, Moriarty) for not realizing how exasperatingly expected they were being.

From sexism to racism to relying too little on our ""gut instincts"" to depending on them to the point of fatal error - it's all in this book. Does Gladwell come to any real consensus about the human mind? Nope. And you know what? I find that one of the more endearing things about this book. You see: you can't thin-splice everything and everyone. Sometimes these snap judgments save, sometimes they cloud. That flip-flop, in my opinion, makes this book an excellent and honest discussion of the brain. Each brain adapts uniquely to their environment and therefore reacts to the same stimuli in vastly different ways. One of my favorite segments in this book revolved around monitoring an autistic subject as he watched a dramatic film. To compare his brain functioning compared to that of a more ordinary brain was a fascinating case study. It speaks a lot to how the brain can shape our world. How it can be our best friend and yet, in certain environments, cripple us in performing the most simple tasks.I'll say it again:Genius....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"May 14, 2014",Jun 2014,"May 14, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/40102.Blink

Gardner plays with the supernatural, love, adventure, and the historical significance of the times she chose.

You've got monks and priors and kings and witches and peasants and nobles all crashing into one another in a mad scramble for power and peace during an incredibly tumultuous time in history. Every time a character gets comfortable? BOOM. Follett throws something else at 'em. It's fresh and interesting and on a topic few people write about. Architecture meets gods meets bloodlust meets a game of thrones?! What?! Why isn't THIS an HBO regular instead of a never talked about 2010 miniseries on Starz??Oh... right... dragons. BUT STILL! These characters have such humanity. The ""heroes"" all have their foils and the ""evil"" characters are twisted and complicated in sometimes uncomfortable ways. Power is a wobbly tower which no one can balance on for too long. This means that Follett gets to play out seemingly endless ""what if..."" scenarios each time someone topples. I mean, c'mon, the guy has 50 years of material here! He can knock the literary board over, pick up the pieces, and re-scatter them pellmell over and over. It feels natural, and it is done masterfully. Also, can we talk for a minute about dramatic irony? Nothing is more annoying than when Character A is all ""oh I love so-and-so but they'll never notice me,"" and so-and-so is on the other end of the stage saying ""Character A is such a dream boat... but I'll never tell!""Dramatic irony can be useful but in the above situation? It is infuriating.Kollett must feel the same way, because when he writes a love scene it reads as follows:""I feel this way and you should know that because it's the truth.""""Well I feel this way, but I'm scared and I don't know and maybe we shouldn't touch.""""Shut up and kiss me because life is too short.""[INSERT MAKE OUT SESSION HERE]{Also insert Beth in the corner crying and yelling ""BRAVA!

""The Year of the Flood"" gave us the perspectives of those out on the street when the (as the characters put it) chaos started. But the third book?The third book picks up where both the others left off. From there, the characters begin to make steps toward building up their lives and navigating the new landscape of the world. Well, they suck at it. All of the decisions the characters make almost made me face palm as I read. Also Jimmy, who was such a strong narrator in the first novel, was already broken from the close of the first and never recovered. That was vastly disappointing. The end of the novel felt rushed and, although it was supposed to be sad, I just felt sort of annoyed.As for the splicing in of the past? Atwood uses Toby as her primary narrator in this story (I won't tell you who ends up sharing those duties later on because, again, annoying). Toby works as a narrator; I enjoyed her backstory in the second installment. However, a large portion of the book involved Zeb telling her his back story. This felt forced and did not read nearly as well as if we had had flashbacks as was provided with literally every other character in the novel. The story kept getting interrupted by Toby's thoughts (and why? why did we need this?). Additionally, while parts of Zeb's story were necessary for the trilogy as a whole, some of these pops-into-the-past parts kind of droned on and I felt myself itching to get back to the present with the Painballers and Pigoons. I guess the first 2 books were full of adrenaline. As you read, you know that the end of the world is imminent, and you enjoy finding out who these people were before, and how it helps them out after. In the third book? There is nothing they're hurtling toward (with the exception of past Zeb who, as I previously explained, was longwinded and didn't hold my attention). While Atwood attempts to provide some tension and some final battle drama (the MaddAddamites do, after all, have predators lurking in the wilderness), nothing comes of those threats. I put the book down feeling underwhelmed and wishing the end of the second book had been an end of the series.

Her love of adjectives, similes, and allegory do not feel clunky as one reads. Rather, she artfully dances through language as though she feels it with her whole body. Her stream-of-consciousness prose, her verbal paintings of NYC, the desert, and the heartbreak of childhood are all palatable. I ripped through the first 200 pages with a vigor and passion reserved only for the best.But then.Oh, but then.This novel gets caught up in how good it could have been. Tartt is aware of her talent; but her awareness begins to bleed through, causing a confusion in narrative and story.You know when you are looking at the Oscar line ups? You see an actor who underwent a severe physical transformation for their role, or a screenplay which deals with the hot controversial issues (homosexuality, race, incest), and you think to yourself ""these people went with these transformations/themes not because they really felt the work, but because they knew it would get them the nod?""That's how this book ends up feeling.Tartt takes a beautiful, interesting, shattered boy and makes him a sad cliche. The drugs, the listlessness, the confusion... it all felt calculated. It was following a recipe for success, rather than allowing the character to grow naturally out of what was otherwise gut-wrenching prose. It's ""Great Expectations"" meets ""White Oleander"" and it is just tired. What's more, I'm not sure her evolving narration gels with the last 30 pages of the novel. The narration style makes sense until the ending: it begins a meandering and beautiful narration (with Theo as a child), then begins to unravel into stream of consciousness with Theo's drug abuse and general confusion as he hurtles through adulthood. But those last 30 pages switch to a philosophical history lesson that sounds out-of-body for the Theo narrator the reader has been with these past 700 pages. What is one to take away from this change? To establish the novel as a whole as a retrospective which Theo has just now written shatters an otherwise natural progression. Despite the attempt to reason this away with ""oh yeah I've been keeping journals and that's how I know all of this,"" there is no way that his voice would change so dramatically from section to section. Are we expected to assume that Theo has grown up so much and has become so wise due to his experiences, that he is able to transcend his own voice to write this story for us? Doubtful, Donna Tartt. Had it not been for the ending, the stunning prose alone would have rendered this book a solid choice to recommend to others, and perhaps even re-read. But I cannot get over how jarred and cheated I felt at the end. Theo was a cracked and imperfect character from the outset. To write him as someone so wizened he deems it appropriate to teach us something; someone so removed from his experiences that he is not shackled by his own voice as he writes his memoir is, for lack of tact, bullshit. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Dec 28, 2014","Jan 27, 2015","Jan 07, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch

Atwood puts to paper so many things I've thought only in the darkest corners of my mind.

I adored almost all of it, and recommend that anyone and everyone read it. That being said, couldn't we have had some sort of definitive close to Snowman's story? I understand that this book is a trilogy, so perhaps Atwood wanted ""Oryx and Crake"" to achieve epic cliff hanger status.

That is, they're the bridge between book 1, which set up the world, and book 3, which contains the Ultimate Climax(tm) of the story. Catching Fire is my favorite book of the entire Hunger Games trilogy. We pick up a few months after the close of The Hunger Games. Katniss Everdeen has moved into the Victors Village with her mother and sister. Her relationships with SadFaceGale and Peeta Mellark are strained as she attempts to navigate what her life will be after competing in a fight-to-the-death reality television show. You know, after she forced The Capitol to crown not one but two victors for the first time in history. Our protagonist is a teenage girl, and Collins makes sure we don't forget that. She's confused and selfish and a little bit naive. As Katniss struggles to figure out who she is and what she wants, she has to contend with the expectations of an adoring public and the simmering possibility of a national uprising. You know, just normal girl things.Katniss is desperately trying to be the girl The Capitol wants her to be, and fails time and time again. Good for her, then, that she has Peeta. Calm, eloquent Peeta, who knows just what to say both in front of the cameras and to Katniss whether she's screaming herself awake from a nightmare or contemplating running off into the woods. This book is first-and-foremost about exploitation, oppression, violence, and how even the purported good guys manipulate pliable people for results. To package that with a love story is spoon-feed-y genius. It's that sprinkling of sugar on the medicine. I'm trying to avoid spoilers here, but here's what I can say: with such a strong first book, it was unclear how Collins could up the ante with her second installment. Well, she did. What's more - now that her world, Panem, is fully built in our minds, we can focus instead on making our main characters more deep and rich. Though Catching Fire has a lot of action, we are also graced with scenes focused on interpersonal relationships and Katniss' confusion as she becomes more open with the people around her.I also just want to gush about the character of Peeta. These books are all through the eyes of Katniss, and that's what makes the characterization of Peeta even more powerful. He's a boy completely in touch with his emotions and OK with it. He is comfortable being vulnerable and honest. He cares, he's free with his heart, he's hopeful, he's kind. These qualities don't make him weak. Peeta is clearly a strong and brave person.We don't get male characters like this. Suzanne Collins deserves a standing ovation for her dynamic male main character who subverts what popular books tell us men ""should"" be. Because, let's be real, all men should be more like Peeta Mellark.PS. If you are an audiobook person, I really can't overhype Tatiana Maslany reading these books.

Writing it off would be a huge mistake. The Hunger Games is incredibly clever. Our protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, is just 16yrs old as she walks us through her world her first-person narration. Katniss lives in some iteration of The United States, but after the ocean claimed swaths of land thanks to global warming... and after a failed revolution that resulted in a totalitarian government. The first person narration is brilliant; we're forced to puzzle things out alongside Katniss. She misinterprets things constantly. She's confused about the motivations of those around her, and about what she should do once she finds herself a competitor in The Hunger Games, a to-the-death reality television show. Katniss can be frustrating at times, but that's the point. She's a teenage girl thrust into an incredibly traumatizing situation that keeps gut-punching her. Her (re)actions to everything in The Games underscores the reality: she's a poor girl from a coal mining district, who has no idea how to be in a television show. She's clueless on how to present herself as anything but herself. And Katniss isn't exactly endearing. After the death of her father and her mother's subsequent catatonic depression, Katniss had to parent both herself and her little sister. This hardened her, made her suspicious of most people. She's not one to be open or vulnerable. It's protection, yes, but it also means everyone is arms length from her.That's what makes Katniss' counterpart, Peeta Mellark, such an effective character. Where Katniss flounders, Peeta breezes through. Where Katniss is offputting, Peeta is endearing. He's also shrew and calculating, acutely aware he's in a television show. He effectively plays the audience and the people around him to maximize survival. Survival for him? Or for Katniss? Katniss isn't sure, and since we only see Peeta through her eyes (remember, first person narration), we aren't immediately sure either. His silver-tongue, his charm... is it genuine? Or is it his biggest weapon against her? There can only be one victor of The Games, after all. As a stand-alone, The Hunger Games is a powerful commentary on poverty, exploitation, and how society can become numb to horror and violence. But The Hunger Games doesn't stand alone. It's a trilogy. And Suzanne Collins has only just begun. I've read the books and watched the movies a couple of times, but recently found out Tatiana Maslany narrated the audibooks. Since Tatiana Maslany is perfection, I decided I'd add another dimension to my Hunger Games experience. First text, then film, now audio. I'm not a big audiobook person. I generally find them boring, and the audiobooks I do listen to are usually memoirs because I find they're the most animated. Well, Maslany has made me a convert. She brings the characters to life..

Good v. Evil, biology v. the soul, weakness of the spirit v. the strength of a rebellion. All of the elements are there. The ""join the dark side"" Darth Vader theme that resonates throughout this third installment was riveting; as were the broken characters within it.Night Eternal opens 2 years after The Master has taken hold of the civilized world as we know it. Those few humans who remain, at the core, free, are cut off from each other, hopelessly wondering if they are the last out there... if the rest of the world has submitted to the Concentration Camp-esque reality that this particular apocalypse has taken. And that's what this really is: an apocalypse. How else would you explain the stripping away of existence as you know it and replacing it with something totally alien.At the heart we have the characters who had been fighting with us since the beginning: Eph, Nora, Fet, and Gus. Everyone is a little worse for the wear, and wondering when it will be time to throw in the towel. The hopeless desperation the reader feels as they dip into each of the main character's minds is excellently written and thoroughly engaging.Then why, you ask did I give it 3 stars? That answer is spoilers abound, and I fear giving too much away. That being said, I will give you a hint. There is nothing I want to read less than religious propaganda when getting my thrills on. Reading up on angels and the magnificence of them just, well, spoils my appetite for Hogan and Del Toro alike. They would have done much better to make the end a defeat/victory (I will not tell you which) for Man rather than higher beings. Because, seriously, who had been working for justice throughout the trilogy? Where was the God Hogan and Del Toro seem to revere in the past 1000 pages?

Sure, the first few times you're titillated and surprised, but soon it devolves into the following catch-22:1. Because you've read so many mystery novels, you can't help but develop a theory early on. You decide almost immediately who the murder is/what the twist will be/who stole the painting/whatever. But it doesn't stop there. You become so attached to your theory that the actual, deviating ending is a disappointment. Even if it's a decent ending it's met with tirades of ""they should have..."" and ""it would have been better if..."" Friends and family alike will cover their ears and run screaming from this. Nobody cares and oftentimes your constructed alternate ending isn't even very good.2. The theory you've created is correct. But now you're peeved that the Big Reveal was so obvious that you were able to discern it from the first few chapters. You then subject friends and family to your smug monologues about how it was clear from page 12 that so-and-so did it. Ugh. Shut up.I was terrified this novel was going to fall into the latter. I weaved my theory early on and clung tight (jabbering incessantly to friends who rolled their eyes and tried to tune me out). Miraculously, about two thirds of the way through the novel my theory was blown apart. Though my hastily revised idea turned out to be the REAL twist, I was neither disappointed nor smug. This book is wonderful, superb, delightful... and any other synonym you've got.I want to gush, but I also don't want to give anything away. So here's the teaser I can muster:It's 1961 at the start of the novel. Laurel is 16 and sees something which forever fractures her views on her family and, particularly, her mother Dorothy. Fifty years later, Dorothy is suffering from dementia and dying. Stirred by her final chance to unearth the truth about what she saw, coupled with the discovery of a curious old photograph, Laurel embarks on a one-woman mission to make sense of the past.Masterfully split between present day Laurel and Blitz-era Dorothy, Morton explores all of the beautiful, complicated, devastating, and compromising iterations of family and of love. She can be funny even in the face of 1941 death and starvation. She can be tender, even when her characters are being despicable. Morton dives headfirst into the squirmier aspects of love, and emerges with prose to twist even the blackest of hearts.I loved it, and I wish it weren't over so I could go on reading forever. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jun 12, 2015","Jun 19, 2015","Jul 09, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13508607-the-secret-keeper

This story is more about Orual with a touch of Psyche on the side. This is not to say that I didn't enjoy the novel. Lewis paints a painfully accurate and beautiful picture about those who use love to cause pain and control. However, he perhaps should have marketed his book differently. Orual makes for a volatile narrator. You are left to resolve her uncertainties as she brims with bias, anger, regret, and fear. Lewis harnesses the desperations and shortcomings of being a woman in power and I hung on every word.That being said, the reader could do with a lot more Psyche. And Cupid? If you weren't already familiar with the tale of Psyche you would not know that he enters the story at all. It's as though Lewis set out to write about the Greek myth, but became so distracted by the story potential in Orual that is original plan never took off. The bottoms line: If you Lewis' writing style and want something different than Narnia this is your bag.

The desperation and fervor of the prose; the determination to mean something... I truly enjoy discovering these as I read.Fitzgerald's novel has a bumpy past. The first draft was rejected so he returned to it, spliced it up, and added some more ""unifying"" portions. He also interjected part of a play he wrote during his Princeton days, and often breaks out into original poetry.Can you tell where I'm going with this?Fitzgerald is a new and inexperienced writer when this comes out.

For one, if you treat ""This Side of Paradise"" as a collection of snapshots rather than one cohesive novel, the resulting effect is quite nice.

Thompson captures a volatile time in history, both politically and socially. He covers McGovern v. Nixon well but, more importantly, he speaks to the layman's outlook on politics: the corruption, the greed, the confusion, the madness. In his drug and alcohol stupors, Thompson manages to be more honest about the American political process than anyone else. It begs the question: if it takes being that strung out to accurately describe our system, isn't it time we changed a thing or two?That being said, Thompson's descriptions often unravel into rants, and he jumps around a lot as new ideas strike him. It is obvious he was on drugs and reading it sober was daunting at times.For anyone into history, specifically political history, this book is a must-read.

At least, this is what writers Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman advertise in the cult classic Good Omens. Devilishly funny and quick-witted, Good Omens chronicles eleven year old Adam Young, Anti-Christ, as he grows up, gets a pet dog, and slouches toward the end of the world.The novel opens with the birth and accidental misplacement of Adam. Originally intended to be raised in a Satanic household, Adam ultimately ends up living an ordinary life with an ordinary family; much to the ignorance of the powers that be. An angel/demon friendship seen in the characters of Aziraphale and Crowley rounds out the plot as the two contemplate thwarting the apocalypse after several centuries of comfortable earth living. They pay close attention to a boy they mistakenly believe to be the son of hell, and join dozens of characters in the mad dash to save humanity during its final days. Pratchett and Gaiman’s take on good vs. evil is truly a tantalizing read and eleven year old Adam Young’s descent into wickedness is both clever and chuckle-inducing. Each character, however fleeting, provides a fresh and entertaining take on all events leading up to the apocalypse. At times it is tempting to grab a notebook in order to keep the characters straight; but the important ones are fleshed out again and again to resolve any confusion. Pratchett and Gaiman’s tag-team lends itself to an engaging, though sometimes chaotic, plotline. While the novel is abounding with wit, the two writers are often forced to play catch up with the staggering number of characters they introduce; leaving parts of the novel a bit slow. Despite changes in pace, Good Omens is a laugh out loud journey that barrels toward the end of the world… and what lies beyond.

The story follows Madeline as she hurtles toward the big ""now what"" question of post graduation in the 80s.

Perhaps I shouldn't exult him as something more than he is. So Eugenides: I'm sorry.This book did nothing for me. Eugenides is attempting to make a commentary on Victorian literature, while making a commentary on religion, while making a commentary on depression/social diseases, while making commentary on women and the institution of marriage, all in the span of 400 pages with only 3 characters to work with. What I'm trying to say is: he tried too hard with too much and thus the entire book fell short.If he had taken one or two of his good ideas and really fleshed them out he would have had a winner on his hands. This is not the case.

She knows how to squash words together into compelling sentences. If she were inept even at this I probably would not have finished reading the novel.You see, nothing ever happens in this book.The novel spans several years and follows 1. a demon/fairy, 2. Mr. Strange, 3. Mr. Norrell, and 4. a butler named Stephen with whom the demon/fairy is obsessed with. That is a lot of ground to cover in my opinion. As such, it should not have been difficult for Clarke to find interesting things to write about. A deal is made with a demon, fundamentals of magic are contradicted and argued over, and there is a supposed prophecy which is on the cusp of being fulfilled. You interested yet? So was I.Unfortunately, Clarke does not follow through with any of her plots. Not. One. Oh sure, she dances around them - she'll bring up these conflicts in order to keep her readers interested - but nothing comes of these otherwise fascinating outsets. Really, dude? Writing a book requires at least a conflict, a climax, and a resolution. Her conflict? Practically nonexistent. What she attempted to pawn off as a climax was a yawner, and the ""resolution"" actually kinda sorta contradicted the structures established from the beginning of the story.

The only reason that I settled on the kinder of the two is because I am enamored with the character Pauline.What do we do with such a woman? She hides behind ideologies of piety and martyrdom but Pauline is, in fact, the most wicked character in the entire novel. I can't wrap my head around Erdrich's creation. Though Pauline has conformed to the ideals of the white man, she is a moral stain in the book. Even still... she views herself as something holy and worthy of the praise of god. Fascinating.The story is engaging, to be sure. Fleur is a wild woman of a character and Nanapush, despite the many penis jokes, is endearing and the sort of character you cannot help but look up to. If nothing else Erdrich has certainly created a cast we care about.That being said I can't help but wonder about the point of the novel. From time to time Erdrich brings in the harsh realities of being a Native American in the early 1900s. There is famine and death and that pesky western money... yet at the close of the novel we have Nanapush talking to Lulu and lingering on the ideas of marriage. Perhaps there is something I am missing at this close? For such a touchy subject I would expect the end to have more of a bang and less of the fizzle I encountered here.

Morrison not only gives us a history lesson, she begs us to see the humanity back in 1690 - how people were treated and how some things really haven't changed. The slavery isn't all just white men ruling over the Other - there are those who choose to be slaves (does that not make sense? Read this book and get back to me).Read this, read this, read this.

When I re-read The Stand in 2020 it dropped in my regard by A LOT. Mostly because it suffers from King's lazy, accidental racism and sexism.And I think that's why The Gunslinger is still great: there are basically no women and/or POCs in the book. It's really just Roland, Mr. Gunslinger himself.Why do I love this book? Because it's a 200+ page description. King is not himself in these pages. He isn't relying heavily on plot and conversation. It's introspective. Roland is walking the desert, thinking back on the past, on regrets, on the fruitlessness of fighting destiny. We see flickers of his past, and how we arrived at the desert, and the long pursuit of The Man in Black. Essentially, The Gunslinger is the story of a man who follows a path that was set before him long ago. He walks it despite doubt, despite fear, despite anger. He follows it knowing he must. He follows it because, after you lose everything, what else is there to do?I don't know how I'll feel at the end of our journey to The Dark Tower, but The Gunslinger remains a fantastic book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,2,"Aug 25, 2023Jun 21, 2011","Aug 29, 2023Jul 04, 2011","Jun 21, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/43615.The_Gunslinger

That said, re-reading this book now, so many years later, I could feel the echoes. I saw phrases I use regularly in conversation now. What I'm saying is: I think I read this book many many times as a teenager. 10? More? I don't know. But, like some of my favorite Buffy episodes, I can repeat whole passages from memory.Remy and I were very similar people as teenagers: Closed off, skeptical of love, wearing our callouses on our sleeves. It's no wonder I basically memorized the book: I was craving a Dexter in my own life; someone who would prove to me that being vulnerable is worth it, that a life lived inwardly isn't fully lived. I am so grateful I grew out of that mentality, and hope Remy did the same. That said, this book smacks of early aughts in good ways... and also in VERY bad ways. Dexter, the love interest, comes on SO STRONG. She said no, dude. Leave her alone. When Remy talks to one of Dexter's friends about his pursuit of her:“Doesn’t matter,” he said, shrugging. “You’re officially a challenge. He’ll never give up now.” Ew. He smiled at this, stopping the window with his hand. “I’ll behave,” he said. “I promise.” And then, he started around the front of the car, as if I had said yes, grabbing the picture off my windshield and tucking it into his back pocket. The next thing I knew he was sliding in beside me, settling into the seat, the door swinging shut behind him.She. said. no. Get out of her car, like, what the fuck. The worst part about this book is the way Sarah Dessen has her protagonist describe losing her virginity. It sounds an awful lot like rape, and Dessen doesn't touch that with a 10ft pole, which felt wildly inappropriate. If you are going to introduce something like that, you've got to unpack it, otherwise you're just being irresponsible. But, like, that's so 2002, right? Did Dessen even think this scene constituted rape back then? Who the hell knows. Anyway, here's the whole scene, for those of you who are curious:(view spoiler)[That was the first night I ever got really drunk. It was a bad start with the cherry brandy, and an hour later I found myself making my way across Albert’s living room, clutching an easy chair for support. Everything was spinning, and I could see Lissa and Chloe and Jess sitting on a couch in the living room, where some girl was teaching them how to play quarters. The music was really loud, and someone had broken a vase in the foyer. It was blue, and the pieces were still scattered everywhere, strewn across the lime carpet. I remember thinking, in my blurry state, that it looked like sea glass.It was one of Albert’s friends, a really popular senior guy, who I bumped into on the stairs. He’d been flirting with me all night, pulling me into his lap while we played Asshole, and I’d liked it, felt vindicated, like it proved I wasn’t just some stupid sophomore. When he said we should hang out and talk, alone, I knew where we were going and why. Even then, I wasn’t new to this.We went into Albert’s bedroom and started kissing, there in the dark, as he fumbled for a light switch. Once he found it I could make out a Pink Floyd poster, stacks of CDs, Elle McPher son on the wall with December beneath her. He was easing me back, toward the bed, and then we were lying down, all so quick.I’d always prided myself on having the upper hand. I had my patented moves, the push offs and casual squirm, easily utilized to slow things down. But this time, they weren’t working. Every time I moved one of his hands another seemed to be on me, and it seemed like all my strength had seeped down to my toes. It didn’t help that I was so drunk that my balance was off, my equilibrium shot. And it had felt so good, for a while.God. The rest comes in bursts when I do reach that far back, always these crazy sharp details: how fast it was all happening, the way I kept coming in and out of it, one second vivid, the next lost. He was on me and everything was spinning and all I could feel was this weight, heavy, pushing me backward until I feel like Alice, being sucked into the rabbit hole. It was not how I wanted my first time to be.When it was over, I told him I felt sick and ran for the bathroom, locking the door with my hands shaking, unable at first to perform even that easiest of operations. Then I gripped the sink, gasping hard into it, my own breath coming back at me, amplified, rattling my ears. When I lifted my head up and looked in the mirror, it was her face I saw then. Drunk. Pale. Easy. And scared, unsteady, still gasping as she looked back at me, wondering what she had done. (hide spoiler)]Are we blaming the victim here? Like, Christ. This is so bad. So, so bad. Especially for a young woman to read, which is who this book is marketed toward. THE VERY NEXT SCENE after this flashback Remy gets drunk at a bar and this guy is chatting her up and asks her to leave with him (very much condensed for readability): “I’ll make sure you get home. Come on.” And then he put his hand on my arm, curling his fingers around my elbow.“Let go”“Don’t be like that”“I’m serious,” I told him, jerking my elbow. He held on. “Let go.”Then he started to tug me off my stool, which normally I would have made more difficult, but again, my balance wasn’t exactly right on just then. Before I knew it I was on my feet, then getting yanked through the crowd.“I said let go, you fucking asshole!” I pulled my arm loose, hard, and it flew up, smacking him in the face and sending him stumbling... One nasty remark from Chris and I’m bar trash, fighting in public with some guy named Sherman? I could feel the shame rising up in me, flushing my face. Everyone was looking at me.“Okay, okay, what’s going on here?” That was Adrian, the bouncer“Crazy bitch. She hit me.”I was standing there, rubbing my arm, hating myself. I knew if I turned around I’d see that girl again, so weak and screwed up. She’d go to the parking lot, no problem. After that night at the party, she’d gotten a reputation for it. I hated her for that. So much I could feel a lump rising in my throat, which I pressed down because I was better than that, much better. I wasn’t Lissa: I didn’t trot my pain out to show around. I kept it better hidden than anyone. I did.“God, this is swelling,” Sherman whined“You want me to call the police?” Adrian asked.“Either I call the cops or I don’t,” Adrian said. “But I got to get back to the door.”“Forget it,” Sherman told him. “I’m out of here.”“You.” Adrian pointed at me. “Go home. Now.”Again, to introduce this scene and not unpack it at all is so insanely irresponsible, and it's scary that I read all this at such an impressionable age. All of the characters, and arguably Dessen herself, seem to be blaming Remy in this scene. It feels so very she asked for it and, like I say, Dessen doesn't unpack these scenes, so how else are we supposed to feel?I had some experiences in college. A man following me out of the bar and trying to pull me in his direction. A man entering a closed off bedroom where he knew I was passed out, because he wanted to be in there with me passed out. Dessen: I did nothing wrong. I was allowed to talk to that man in the bar without sleeping with him. I was allowed to get drunk and choose to sleep in my friends room without fear. I didn't ""deserve"" these experiences, and neither did Remey, even in 2002, when women were, apparently, always at fault. Why the 3 stars, then? This feels like a stinker. Well, despite it all, I still see so much of me in Remy that I can't help but love her and, thus, like this book. Here are some quotes I actually like from this book, very much informed by my own adolescent experience:She takes on husbands the way other people change their hair color: out of boredom, listlessness, or just feeling that this next one will fix everything, once and for all.I’d powered through the last two years with my eyes on one thing, which was getting out. Getting gone... Just me and the future, finally together. Now there was a happy ending I could believe in.The conquest-getting me alone-was all that mattered, and once he saw me up close I wasn’t so special after all. But I, of course, knew that already.I didn’t show weakness: I didn’t depend on anyone. And if he’d been like the others, and just let me go, I would have been fine. It would have been easy to go on conveniently forgetting as I kept my heart clenched tight, away from where anyone could get to it.The past was so sticky, full of land mines: I made it a point, usually, not to be so detailed in the map of myself I handed over to a guy. And the song, that song, was one of the biggest keys to me. Like a soft spot, a bruise that never quite healed right. The first place I was sure they would strike back, when the time came for them to do so.

Yes, he was very political in his life so why wouldn’t we expect his novels to reflect that? The difficulty with him is the following:a)	He is trying to explain an entire movement in the Victorian period: the struggle for the rights of the working class. To encapsulate this in around 400 pages is extremely difficult to do. Thus, Disraeli introduces A LOT of characters that randomly show up one in every 20 chapters. Confusing? Fuck yes.b)	He has to deal with the structure of traditional story telling v. his hopes for the characters he has created. He thus has to compromise either his beliefs or the believability of his inventions.c)	He was kind of a dick in real life.That being said I did enjoy this book.

Although to just simply sit down and read it can be daunting, to act it out is something completely different. Beaumont was a very intelligent man in that he played with the concepts of satire and parody that his audience wasn't ready for (explaining why this play wasn't well received in the beginning). The citizen and his wife, though frustrating at times, add certain elements to the play that are wonderfully original. The character Rafe is, by far, the best character in the play for all that he represents. And Humphrey! My God, Humphrey. The man only speaks in rhyme, which illutrates to the ridiculousness of the romantic genre and how it is ""played out."" All in all Beaumont was a critic of the very thing he worked in.

Luckily, Ali made it quite easy with her informative, horrific, and yes, even (sometimes) funny story. A must for anyone looking into the life of Muslim women, and a harrowing look into the climate of her time, Ali is not shy with the life she has led. I truly enjoyed every bit of this book but be warned: this book is not for those in love with superfluous adjectives or pretty language. Ali is frugal with her words, which adds to the gritty nature of her subject, but this style is not for everyone (though someone did stop me at the airport to let me know he loved the book).Recommendation: give it a try.

I sat down, read, got frustrated, paced the room, sat down again, slammed the book down, pulled at my hair, bit my nails, tried AGAIN, and finally gave up.Stephen King was right: Stephanie Meyer cannot write worth a darn.Her characters are flat, as is her scenery. Her writing style is elementary and littered with grammatical errors (someone should slap her editor, seriously), PLUS the plot itself was horrible. How is Bella likable to anyone at all? She is whiny and pathetic to the point that I could not put my brain through any more trauma and had to give up Twilight forever.Shame on all of you.

As the book went on, however, it drastically lost its flair and I found myself wading through the last hundred pages, wishing it would just be over already.

You don't have to read the whole thing, but Wright is writing the facts as they were in 2003. He does not add literary flare, his does not shove his own political opnions down your throat, and he stays true to simple war facts.There are some difficulties with the novel: Wright wants to be so accurate he introduces us to a new character every 5 pages, which makes it rather confusing as to who is who. He also doesn't want to leave out any one instance, and doesn't want to condense for authenticities sake, thus you are stuck reading very similar situations over, and over, and over.Despite this I did enjoy the novel. It was a slow read, but every time I picked it up I enjoyed Wright's voice, and his ability to distance himself from the content.

And though this book is no exception, it came pretty damn close.Del Toro and Hogan embrace the pace of Hollywood and somehow seamlessly weave it into novel form with ""The Strain"". Though a sucker for horror, I consider myself critical of the genre (having read so much of it, you see), and these two men deserve a standing ovation for what they put out. They provide explanations for the phenomenon driving ""The Strain"" (trust me it's a lot to ask when most writers are saying ""dude, whatever, it's horror/sc-fi! Nothing needs to be defined.'), a compelling (and gleefully well-written) narrative, and talent with the pen that had me sleeping with the light on last night. With all the crap out there, it's nice to see some people still know what a captivating story is.I will admit they ripped off the third ""Blade"" movie ever-so-slightly but other than that the novel is surprisingly original. The 'main' character works for the CDC which was brilliant, if you're asking me, so the reader gets a deep look into the transformation from man to monster (but who is to say we weren't that far off to begin with?). PLUS the authors stalk around the 5 Boroughs, peeking through all sorts of windows, so you're getting a bird's eye view of the metamorphosis, with a broad spectrum of human reactions. ('But Beth!' you whine, 'all those POVs are confusing! I hate when authors do that!' Well suck it up. Seriously. It's not as confusing as it may seem, just take note of names and places, write it on a goddamn notepad if you have to... this book is worth flipping back through pages going: 'now who the hell is this again...?')I plan on sharing this novel with everyone around me, and that includes you, dear browsers of cyber-space: go read ""The Strain.""

When critiquing structure rather than prose, I am quick to jump on the bandwagon and pronounce this novel a crucial part of the literature canon. London is a master at internal dialogue, descriptions, conflict - his technique is flawless. I understand and support this novel remaining a required reading for students, for it teaches how to lay out a novel, how to not ramble, how to stay on point with the development of your characters and conflicts.....But that's it. That's all the milk I could squeeze out of this stone of a book.Because personally?

I'm that asshole who gasps when the pet is inevitably murdered in the horror movie. I hate it - it's not for me. So London and I will never be best friends. Reading London was like watching an ice skater perform a beautiful routine, only to have him open his mouth and be incredibly racist and chauvinistic and pigheaded and disgusting.

Well, then, have I got a book for you!The Age of Innocence is one of my all-time favorite novels. But, surprisingly enoIs 2020 not depressing enough? Well, then, have I got a book for you!The Age of Innocence is one of my all-time favorite novels. But, surprisingly enough, I haven't read anything else by Edith Wharton. Looking to remedy that, I packed up The House of Mirth for my lakeside vacation (vacation?! In 2020?!). Yes, and I even have the negative COVID test to prove it.ANYWAY.In case you were wondering, The House of Mirth is decidedly NOT an appropriate vacation read.Lily Bart, the story's protagonist, is 29, and beginning to feel her age. Though she is as lovely as ever, she sees the door for a ""good"" marriage beginning to creak shut. Her father was financially ruined just after Lily ""came out"" in society, and Lily has lived under a domineering, stodgy-yet-wealthy aunt ever since, toggling between looking for a rich husband (what she ""should"" want) and trying to actually be happy in this life (what she, despite better reason, wants). Wharton cuts like a goddamn razor when it comes to the upper echelons of New York high society. The people floating around up there are fake, vapid, cruel, manipulative. While Lily doesn't fit in when it comes to the contents of her coffers, she is beautiful, and she comes from ""good stock,"" so those claiming to be her friends take her along to parties and on grand vacations, simultaneously judging and talking about her, still unmarried, and conspicuously having friendships with married men (something that, were she to be married too, would not be an issue). Lily knows she should marry one of the several wealthy men circling her. However, all of them repulse her as much as their money allures her. To complicate matters further, it seems as though Lily might actually be falling in love... with the objectively NOT wealthy Lawrence Selden. Selden sees who she really is, and he still cares for her. Though he sees her beauty, it's not just her beauty that entices him. This excites her, and also terrifies her. To marry Selden is to give up on the finer things in life that she, despite herself, feels she needs.And that's where we get to the really depressing part of the book. You feel for Lily, you really do. She is trapped in a lesser position in society, simply because she was born Woman. Any attempts to try and secure wealth independently is met with either scorn or suspicion. The idea of marrying for love is laughable; Lily, like most women, is looking for the most financially secure suitor. That said, Wharton does a frustratingly fantastic job at painting the contradictions within Lily. She wishes she could move around in the financial world like the husbands of her friends. But, in the next breath, she verbally abuses the working women around her: cleaning women, laundresses, etc. While she is aware of her misfortunes, she is blissfully blind to the women around her who have it so much worse. Lily's forays into being a secretary, hat trimmer, etc., don't even endear her to the working women around her. Despite railing against the condition of being Woman at this time, any women ""below"" her are simply Other, and Lily is incapable of acknowledging the larger societal issues at play when it comes to the role of Woman. This crystallizes toward the end of the novel, when Lily is taken in by Nettie Struther, a poor woman that Lily once helped when she was volunteering with the only good character in the book, Evie. Lily is at her absolute lowest: living alone in a boarding house, sitting in the rain, realizing the futility of her situation. She is incapable of playing the cruel game her ""friends"" play, and so she has officially lost that game. Nettie takes Lily to her home, where she is warm and cozy and dry with her baby and her husband. Nettie has taken her ""less-than"" life, and has made something comfortable, albeit it plain. Lily is even repulsed by this. She cannot see Nettie's happiness; she only sees how small her home is, how much she lacks. Thus, reading this book, I absolutely hated Lily. I felt sorry for her still, yes, but I couldn't stand how, because of her social standing, Lily was incapable of broadening her frame. And that is Wharton's genius. She is able to use Lily as a magnifying glass into all that rot within high society. Yet, even though Lily is Other from that group, her desire to be among them makes her suck, too. It's a ladder of suck, and Lily is perched on a pretty high rung.In the struggle between who we actually are and what society wants us to be, it is possible to slip between the cracks of the two, and destroy yourself more completely than if you had just chosen. I need a drink just thinking about it, but commend Wharton for how she unfolded that for us in Lily.Brava. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Aug 18, 2020","Aug 21, 2020","Dec 15, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17728.The_House_of_Mirth

These are hot button topics now, nevermind in 1945, looking back at the 1920s. The story follows Charles Ryder as he begins university. A sheltered and impressionable boy, he cannot help but notice the magnetic if not somewhat eccentric Sebastian. Sebastian takes a shining to Charles, and the two become close friends and lovers for a spell, after which Charles remains somewhat tethered to Sebastian's family, and all the tragedy they represent.It's difficult to pick apart the book without spilling the beans on the entirety of the story. Suffice it to say that Waugh takes a beautiful look at how humans sacrifice happiness for what they are supposed to do, and how we grip onto the past even as it turns to dust in our fingers.My gripe with the story is that, while undoubtedly a breaker of ground in its time, it reads a little stale in the present day. I wasn't compelled to read, I did not have much sympathy or attachment to the characters, and I certainly wasn't sad when it was over. While there are one or two beautiful passages in this book, they are far eclipsed by boring recounts of what was eaten and drunk, and how the rich idled away their time. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Mar 03, 2018","Mar 11, 2018","Dec 15, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/30933.Brideshead_Revisited

""A Passage to India"" is a novel which does not shy away from questions which are still tosseForster was incredibly brave for penning the book he did. ""A Passage to India"" is a novel which does not shy away from questions which are still tossed around almost one hundred years later: does god exist? What is racism? How is the justice system flawed and how can we fix it? Again, I commend him.There is a ""circle of screaming"" sort of mentality when it comes to racism in this novel. The British fear the Indian aristocrats, who fear the lower class, who fear the untouchables, who are so far removed as to be perceived as beautiful by the British and so on around-and-around. It's a ""I am jealous of/fear this other person so let me lash out at whatever is directly below me."" This general observation of society is startlingly acute even today.On the flip side of this story we have the troubling Woman and her fragile sexuality. The White Woman cries assault, and she is immediately taken at her word, despite her obvious uncertainty in herself. Forster paints Adela as an unreliable narrator from the start. In fact, everyone is unreliable in their own way within this novel. This may be frustrating for some, but I feel it is an accurate portrayal of human nature and as such it makes for a truly compelling story. If you could not tell from by my liberal use of adjectives: I adored this book. Even the heavy-handed extended metaphor which dragged on for the last ~40 pages of the novel. Screw it.

I see that! I get that! Why do we have to read 10 paragraphs about the drapes?! God! Lucy, our protagonist, was not someone for whom I was rooting. Forster's narrative appears to be suggesting that women are ""more"" than men, but this book doesn't pass the Bechdel test, so that didn't exactly hit. George was fun to read, and Freddy was just stupid enough to be entertaining, and George's father was a cool lil dude. Everyone else in this book can go scratch. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Mar 30, 2023","Apr 02, 2023","Dec 15, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3087.A_Room_with_a_View

I understand why sales of 1984 are soaring; our current reality is crawling toward dystopia. Aldous Huxley was an incredibly interesting, intelligent, and compassionate man. After reading his Wikipedia page, I have a slight crush on this British man who ate vegetarian, spoke out against war, questioned religion, taught George Orwell, and used his success to transport people who would have most likely otherwise died out of Hitler's Germany. Dystopian literature is important now more than ever. It reminds society to check itself, before it wrecks itself. And who better a man to provide that check than the idealistic and achingly brilliant Huxley. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jan 11, 2017","Jan 25, 2017","Dec 15, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5129.Brave_New_World

It's a book wherA weaving, meandering narrative about the Ramsay family and friends, as seen on two separate days, many years apart from one another. It's a book where nothing really happens and, shockingly, I'm okay with this.Don't read Woolf for the plot, climax, conclusion formula of literature. Read her for the beautiful way she manipulates word; for the mastering of the English language. ""To the Lighthouse"" is split into three parts:Part IThe Ramsay's and co. are young. Some characters fret about marriage and the future, while others romp by the shore and others more worry about the choices they have made, and how it will reflect upon them when they are dead and gone. A jumping, stream-of-consciousness narration, where actual dialogue is few and far between. Instead, Woolf focuses on the innermost thoughts, desires, and fears of her characters. One could be peering into the mind of Mrs. Ramsay, only to have Minta walk by and, almost jarringly, we peer into Minta's head until she bumps into Mr. Banks and immediately hear his thoughts. It's as though you are a mosquito on the grounds, buzzing from one person to the other, getting close to their ear, and listening to the echoes of their minds.In short, it's incredible. Part IITakes place during the night. As everyone snuffs out their lights and prepares themselves for sleep, the reader is tucked into a time machine and prepares to jolt into the future. Though Mrs. Ramsay is checking on her youngest children before bed, the reader is clued into her fate. Children who will grow up and die in the war are painted as young boy and KIA solider in the same breath. The maid tidies up from the day, ruminating on the day's activities, and the events which will occur far off into the future. It's a psychedelic literary experience (don't think that's a thing? think again) to exist both in the present and the distant future of the characters, but Woolf is a natural and pulls it off with ease.Part IIIWe are officially in the future, following the surviving characters as some make their way to the lighthouse, and others stay on the grounds, thinking over their lives and losses.If the plot isn't enough to suck you in, I'd like you to hear from Woolf herself. Her insights into the human condition are poignant and heartbreaking and can you tell I'm in love?""...how life, from being made up of little separate incidents which one lived one by one, became curled and whole like a wave which bore one up and threw one down with it, there, with a dash on the beach.""""The words seemed to be dropped into a well, where, if the waters were clear, they were also so extraordinarily distorting that, even as they descended, one saw them twisting about to make Heaven knows what pattern on the floor of the child’s mind.""""For now she need not think about anybody. She could be herself, by herself. And that was what now she often felt the need of — to think; well, not even to think. To be silent; to be alone. All the being and the doing, expansive, glittering, vocal, evaporated; and one shrunk, with a sense of solemnity, to being oneself, a wedge-shaped core of darkness, something invisible to others.""""If she had said half what he said, she would have blown her brains out by now.""""What does one live for? Why, one asked oneself, does one take all these pains for the human race to go on? Is it so very desirable? Are we attractive as a species? Not so very, he thought...""""...thinking again of Mrs. Ramsay on the beach; the cask bobbing up and down; and the pages flying. Why, after all these years had that survived, ringed round, lit up, visible to the last detail, with all before it blank and all after it blank, for miles and miles?""Excuse me, I have to go swoon now...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Mar 18, 2015","Apr 15, 2015","Dec 15, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/59716.To_the_Lighthouse

I want to slap them), despite a weird and faceless narrator who did not feel necessary and who still, even at the end, did not seem qualified to know all he claims to know, I loved this book.It's weird.When I began reading The Brief Wondrous Life..., I had pretty low expectations. Diaz has a gruff way of writing; a forced street tongue which felt clunky coupled with a distracting amount of LOTR references. Okay, I thought. This isn't going to go very well.And I would have been right, if I didn't become so completely emotionally invested in Oscar.Now, full disclosure, my feelings about Oscar are swayed by my life experiences. Without blowing up anyone's spot, I know an Oscar (or, rather, I channeled someone I care about into Oscar), so everything he went through, all of the slights and disappointments and depression, hit me right in the ribs.Oscar isn't a character we as readers come across very often. He's not just socially awkward - he is nonsocial (note: NOT anti-social. Oscar would love to have friends and people who love him, he just can't find someone to share his life with, save his sister Lola). He tries and fails infinitely to make connections with the outside world and, with every failure, retreats further into a world of scribbled notebooks, sci-fi film, and fantasy novels.Even we as readers do not get a full picture of Oscar, as he is presented to us through the eyes of Yunior, a ""friend"" of Oscar's. (view spoiler)[But, dude, how the hell does he have the right to tell us about Oscar? A dick of a room mate who kept trying to make it with Oscar's sister? Then, when he finally did get Lola, he continued to cheat on her until she left him? Talk about an unreliable (and far removed!!) narrator. Ugh. (hide spoiler)] Yunior is an odd choice (and I'm being diplomatic there). However, yielding control of the story to him shrouds Oscar further in mystery, so we see him as an outsider would. He is the person you see in the hallway, but don't really acknowledge. He's the guy sitting a few seats down on the subway you don't make eye contact with. You are both intrigued and put-off by his lack of self-care, of the earnest in his eyes. I want to take Oscar out of the book and give him a hug.Outside of the character Oscar, The Brief Wondrous Life... provides its audience with a history and culture lesson which we as Americans never get in school. I know nothing about the DR - who was going to teach me? World Lit. focused on ancient Rome & Egypt... maybe there were some Huns sprinkled in there. Oh and don't forget all the Martin Luther babble because our country is still steeped in religion an-*ahem* - I'm sorry, I'm getting off topic.What I'm trying to say is, even if you don't feel for Oscar like I feel for Oscar, Diaz's ability to weave a compelling narrative around a stodgy history lesson is impressive. As an adult, I am only going to learn these things if they are hidden and wrapped prettily, like sneaking vegetables into a child's dessert. So thank you, Diaz, for feeding me my vegetables. And I encourage you, dear reader, to eat yours too. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Mar 22, 2016","Apr 06, 2016","Dec 11, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/297673.The_Brief_Wondrous_Life_of_Oscar_Wao

Lyra, in my mind, is the heroine every little girl should encounter as soon as she is able to handle chapter books. Pullman challenges his youthful readers to question authority and convention as he rallies against religion and upholds science. And he packages all of this, beautifully, in a few fantasy novesl. Lyra's adventure comes to a head in this third and final installment of the ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy. All of the moving pieces (the clans of witches, the angels, Lord Asriel, Ms. Coulter, Mary Malone, The Church, The Dead... god I could go on) slam into each other in a final battle against destiny and the movement of the world. I had a distinct memory of finishing this book as a child and crying from the emotional weight of it all, but all the same I was surprised to find myself tearing up again, 15 years after my initial reading. Lyra's choices and losses were written so passionately it makes me suspicious that Pullman may have written a memoir here, and actually had fallen into a world of daemons and war and objects with incredible, magical properties (so, seriously Mr. Pullman, come clean. Are you Will? Cause, ya know, your secret is safe with me).Pullman urges his audience to remain curious and wild and ardent, to always question and never settle, to accept that grownups do not necessarily know more than their younger counterparts, and to never, ever, forget what it's like to believe in magic. A standing ovation, from both my 12 and 26 year old selves.

A very dark second installment, ""The Subtle Knife"" tackles mortality, deception, and growing up masterfully. Though at times it feels a little too grown up (seriously, Pullman? With the Daemon stroking already??), the author challenges his audience to think about science, religion, and the tenuous strands of reality and life itself. Am I gushing? I don't mean to - truly I don't! I am first to admit that this novel isn't nearly as compulsive as the first (all of the thinking and dull conversations in the air balloon, while necessary for plot clarity, most definitely drag).

Little old lady Iris writing a memoir about her life and living in the present day (1999)2. The memoir itself, primarily focusing on the 1930s3. Newspaper ""articles"" filling in certain gaps4. The book The Blind Assassin, by Laura Chase (Iris' sister)Disjointed novels like this are totally up my alley. Using perspectives like newspaper articles and Laura's book were excellent devices to look at Iris' story at wholly different angles... especially when there are so many ""mysteries"" in the novel (we'll get to those quotation marks, and my lackluster three star rating, later). So here's what we know in the beginning: pretty much everyone Iris had any connection to is either dead, or torn away from her. It's sad. She's a lonely old woman in the winter of her life, reflecting on her past mistakes.Ouch.Driven by duty and what is expected of her, Iris systematically stomped on every chance at happiness when she was younger. Atwood, surprisingly, does not do a great job of fleshing out Iris' hopes and dreams. Instead, the core of Iris' character circles around being and doing what she assumes she is supposed to do, and cowering in a corner.My venom spitting aside, Atwood once again wows us with her lyrical prose, and I couldn't help but grab a pencil to underline particularly beautiful passages. However, at the end of the day The Blind Assassin is just so dang sad and tired that I closed the book and thought to myself ""well, shit, I just feel bad now.""If you want to know why, you'll have to be spoiled below!(view spoiler)[ First off, the twists in the novel can be seen from approximately 10,000 miles away. OF COURSE Laura didn't actually write The Blind Assassin. She was such an innocent idiot, she could never write something fueled with passion (though, to be fair Iris doesn't have enough flesh on her bones to seem capable either, but I digress). Secondly, OF COURSE Laura was actually pregnant, and OF COURSE it was Richard's baby. I never understood Atwood making Iris think ""oh, it must have been Alex."" I guess it's just to keep the reader guessing as to who the woman is in The Blind Assassin? But, c'mon, it's obvious Alex is in love with Iris, why the hell would he sleep with her sister??Lastly, The Blind Assassin has such a thinly veiled double meaning, I was just like ""well, everyone should have just killed Iris and they all would have been happy."" Because OF COURSE The Blind Assassin is actually Iris herself. Without Iris in the mix pretty much no one would have died. Her father would not have been driven into madness by Richard (because there would not have been a Richard), Laura would not have had such a strong emotional meltdown, and Alex would have run away long ago and would not have been caught in the war. SHE inadvertently killed everyone she loved. SHE is the blind assassin, and it's annoying.

The narrative can drag a little and sometimes he gets caught up in his own Christian propaganda at the end.Even so the book is brutal, in a good way, and I don't love Clapton any less for it....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Jun 2008,"Nov 18, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1207904.Clapton

I so missed the train on this one.Had I read Omnivore's Dilemma when it first appeared on my book shelf (2008? 2009?), it would probably still be relevant. As it stands, however, Pollan is speaking to a 2006 audience, which is vastly different from 2015. These days CSAs abound, we are moving away from corn syrup, and Farmers Markets are booming. Was this in direct relation to Pollan's book? Probably not. But he did bring up a lot of important issues that definitely provide a frame of how far we've come in the past 10 years.Pollan's book is important because it is a snapshot of our culture and of our relationship with food. As a vegetarian myself, some portions of the book were a little rough to read (I know all about those chicken farms, which is why I haven't eaten chicken in 10+ years); but I powered through to get to the message underneath that gore. Pollan gets a little preachy at times - and definitely views himself as on a higher moral plane than his readers. But maybe he deserves to feel a little superior. In 2006, the majority of consumers weren't thinking about where their food was coming from, or how the life the food came from was treated. And, it does stand to question, why we would put so little thought into something so vital to our lives.

I didn't remember much about this one - my Oma purchased it for me when in came out in paperback form so I was all of... 13? years old when it came out? It sounds like King's publishers wanted him to provide an introspective ""how-to"" for his audience. Even 20 years ago he was already quite the prolific author... sounds like an easy cash grab, eh?King acknowledges fully that there is no guide map to being a writer. What works for him didn't work for Hemingway or Woolf or DeMille or any other popular novelists. But, you're reading this book, so here's what works for him. The funniest thing about this book is his statement that he very rarely knows where his books are going plot wise. Instead, a character or a scene or a question pops into his head, and he sits down and tries to see where that snippet will take him. If you, like me, have read a lot of Stephen King, this makes SO MUCH SENSE. So many King books start off strong and then go off the rails by the end. Even beloved books like IT go haywire, while books like Under the Dome and The Outsider unravel about 2/3 of the way through. If I remember correctly, I think his youngest Owen King actually suggested the ending for Under the Dome. Which makes sense, because it suuuccckkksss.While this book is primarily about how he writes/how to write, the first section of this book is all memoir, and King had quite the childhood. A bit of neglect, a bit of abuse, and a whole lot of imagination. It's not surprising that King became a writer, but it's impressive that he kept with it even while he and partner Tabitha were struggling in the late 60s/early 70s. If you have any interest in King the man, then this book is 100% for you.The real kicker of this book is that King was halfway through writing it when he was hit by that car in 1999. King recounts the whole ordeal in this book and holy hell is he lucky he didn't die. I am very familiar with that area of Maine: my Oma lives there. When she had a heart attack a water helicopter had to land on the lake and rush her to the hospital. When my Opa died there it took over an hour for someone to come and take his body away. It's a beautiful area... but it's remote as hell. Three cheers for the medical staff who attended to King and saved his life.The extra extra kicker is this little bitty footnote at the end of one page. King is talking about how Bryan Smith, the man who struck Stephen King with his car, was given a relatively light sentence for almost killing a man. After detailing how Smith could be on the road as early as 2001, he asterixes down to a footnote that says Bryan Smith was found dead at his trailer home shortly before this book went to print, 1 year after the accident... on Stephen King's birthday.There was no sign of trauma or indication that he had died in pain. The empty bottles of painkillers found nearby were the only indication of probable cause.  The Guardian, Oct 1, 2000This article and others like it go on to say that a toxology report would take months to come back. Some basic Googling fails to show any follow-up on the matter, except a quick line in 2010 NPR interview with King himself: ""A toxicology test indicated he died of an accidental overdose, a combination of medication and alcohol.""...So we're left with a question: who killed Bryan Smith? Himself? Or...?Post Script:Excerpt from a Cracked.com ""article"" (remember that place on the internet?)Smith -- a drug user with 11 prior driving offenses -- was rushing to get some ""Marzes bars"" from the store... Smith thought he'd hit a deer at first, but then he noticed a pair of bloodied glasses on his passenger seat... King's first act of revenge was to buy the minivan that almost killed him for 1,500 dollars so he could beat the shit out of it with a sledgehammer, because that's the sort of therapy you can have when you're rich. Then things got creepier... Smashing his tormentor's van with a sledgehammer and seeing Smith's physical and mental departure from this plane of existence wasn't enough for King, who had to make sure Smith lived on in infamy. His Dark Tower series is like 11 Bibles long and difficult to explain, but in it you'll find a character who has a Rottweiler named Bullet, drives a blue minivan, and is generally an all-around mouth-breather. He's an irresponsible, mentally deficient drug addict, and his name is -- cue gasp of surprise -- Bryan Smith. Smith is looking to score some drugs when he hops in his van, and almost strikes a fictionalized King, who's saved by the sacrifice of hero Jake Chambers... King's passive-aggressive jab was written years after Smith's death and served as the ultimate cherry on top of his rage sundae. Thanks to King's ceaseless anger, Bryan Smith is immortalized as a drug-addled asshat who damn near kills a beloved character, because in horror, even death can't spare you from revenge. By the by, Stephen King didn't buy and/or smash the car - it was cubed (I learned this from that same 2010 NPR interview. And, honestly, I don't blame him for his anger.

Huge.I remember thinking The Stand was one of the best books I'd ever read.Best?! Really?! If this is what I thought best was in ~2005 I shudder to think about what books I was reading back then. In The Stand, a super flu wipes out most of the human race. Survivors in the United States begin to band together behind two forces: a kindly, holy, old woman, and arguably the devil himself. It's a good v. evil epic, and was especially interesting to read as we passed over the 1yr mark of our own super flu pandemic. I've got a couple hundred pages left of this 1141 page 1990 reboot, but, let me tell you: the racist and sexist language in here is crazy bananas. Do I think King is a racist and/or sexist? No, I do not. But reading this book was flat out painful at times for its lack of self-awareness. One could argue it is a victim of its time, having originally been published in 1978. But, no. I've read books a hundred years older than this one that didn't hit me upside the head will all this fucked-up-ppery. Was King intentionally make me uncomfortable with the racism and sexism? Taking it head-on instead of dancing around it or utterly ignoring the race/sex problem like those very aged books I just vaguely mentioned? I mean, maybe? But he did a clumsy ass job of it. Also, it's not just the characters that dabble in racist/sexist language... the narrative itself is guilty of those crimes. And what good is that, I wonder? Here are only 2 of passages I marked:There were plenty of Occidental executives, but enough of them were Japanese to make him feel, at six-feet-two, like a very tall horse's ass. The small men and women with the upslanted eyes look at his caked forehead and bloody jacket sleeve with unsettling Oriental blandness....Whoa Her fever had given her a rose, girlish glow that went jarringly with her bereavement. Perhaps the minister had been afraid she was going to make a pass at him.Bitch is actively dying. Are you kidding me with this?This doesn't even scratch the surface. I'm not going to bog us down by including all of the horrible language surrounding the mentally handicapped or African Americans.

Lyra, a girl of only 11, is thrown into a complex destiny plot, unwittingly charged with an adventure which will decide the course of every world's future, and of destiny itself.
