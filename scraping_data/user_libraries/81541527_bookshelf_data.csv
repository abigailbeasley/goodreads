Like so many of the books I love, Demirtaş’s stories are windows on to a world that many of us have never seen or know little about. What makes them unforgettable is their insistence on hope, reminding us again of the power of human stories.

Golden Child is a perfect example of the kind of book I have always loved best: it’s a story that brings otherwise faraway places into focus and allows us to see the world in a new way, illuminating with resounding empathy and humanity all the losses, loves, and profound truths of others’ lives. In Claire’s spare and elegant prose, the remote country of Trinidad is brought to life with a simmering lyricism and quiet and secretive agony, and the characters she’s crafted feel real, immediate, and thrillingly truthful.
