Initially, I really liked having the two perspectives and learning about the two wars side-by-side, but toward the end I found I really liked Eve's storyline and was somewhat meh about Charlie's. I loved learning about the Alice Network and found myself interested enough to do some reading about the history after I finished the book. Kate Quinn incorporated a few real historical figures which is always fun. I found Charlie to be kinda annoying (especially when she randomly added in mathematical statements, which didn't seem to be a big part of her personality for anything other than saying something quirky from time to time). I also thought that there were too many random weird coincidences (like someone always being there to explain/move the plot along when they show up) to be believable--though maybe that's what the aftermath of a war is like? Also found the relationships to be somewhat fake--I wasn't convinced that Charlie and Rose were really that tight and the development of the relationships between Eve, Charlie, and Finn seemed somewhat forced. Overall, I enjoyed and I'm looking forward to discussing in bookclub tonight!

There was one little itty bitty twist at the end that made me think oh nice but otherwise, I was honestly annoyed by the narrator and the concept of the whole book being written as a play. It does read the way someone would talk/tell a story (which I think is the intention) but I didn't love that style.

It's not your typical, straightforward mystery novel-- it explores themes like ableism, immigration, race, etc., and the only witness to the disappearance is the younger brother, who is nonverbal (with Autism & Angelman Syndrome). I thought it was really interesting to read more about what the experience of being nonverbal may have been like for Eugene, feeling disregarded entirely despite having real thoughts that he just couldn't express. I was a bit dissatisfied with the overall story of the disappearance and how we never *really* figure out what happens, but I guess in a way that makes the reader more closely take the perspective of Mia who is also somewhat dissatisfied. I didn't love the style of writing that Mia kept referring to things she'd learn in the future (like blah blah blah we didn't think anything of it at the time, but later I looked back on the moment and blah blah blah). I feel like it took me out of the story a bit and was like HEY PAY ATTENTION THIS IS IMPORTANT lol. Anyway, overall a good, fun read with substance, too!Hmm I'm coming back with some more thoughts. Upon further reflection, I discovered that I had assumed that Angie had a child or some direct connection to the nonverbal Autistic/AS community...knowing that she actually doesn't, I am not sure that this is her place to tell this story and educate on what it's like to have a nonverbal child.

There were all the components of a great story in this. Loved the scavenger hunt style adventure, the themes that hit a little too close to home, the expression of love directly and indirectly. Loved the concept that his mom accidentally became the face of a movement and the idea of guilt when you realize you were ignoring the problem because it didn’t affect you specifically — again a super relevant and important idea to sit with.

The way Dr. Tweedy chose to write his book - through sharing patient anecdotes - made it easy to read and feel more relatable. Overall, I thought most of the anecdotes illuminated themes I've thought about quite a bit (how people in rural areas have worse access to healthcare, how social determinants of health affect people, how bias affects care), but I thought that sharing the themes through stories was an impactful way to shed light on them. An interesting tidbit that I'll remember from this book is how Dr. Tweedy mentioned that the biases go both ways - the physician has biases against their patient and the patient has biases against their physician. It was also interesting to read about how black patients sometimes trusted Dr. Tweedy less, too.

I have never read a memoir so ingenious - Machado plays with different styles of telling her story and ropes the reader in so tightly that I couldn't put it down until I finished it. Her writing is incredible, so beautiful, emotional, and heart-wrenching. Machado does have a way of making her readers feel something deeply, to understand a situation they have never been in before... of describing an event without taking the reader through each moment, but rather talking around the event. I loved that the book had one central theme and Machado didn't waste time adding extraneous details (not saying that I don't feel like I want to know more about Machado and her life, but her book had a goal and she honestly knocked it out of the park). She did a great job at interspersing history and literature surrounding abuse in queer relationships, while still staying focused on her truths. I felt uncomfortable acknowledging ways I had believed the popular narratives she wrote about (women can't, and don't, abuse other women, for example - I know that's not true, but felt like I had been persuaded by popular culture that this could be true), and found myself happy to be reading something that challenged me. Truly, this was so beautiful. (I also loved reading this after having read her collection of short stories because I got to see some of the parts of her stories that came from her own life. It made her stories more rich and beautiful.)...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jan 02, 2021","Jan 03, 2021","Jan 01, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43317482-in-the-dream-house

I'll start by saying that every time I read a medical memoir, I'm always amazed by how vulnerable patients are with their doctors. I feel so lucky to be let into that world and that Dr. Harper shared these stories with me. I'm so looking forward to building relationships with my future patients- it's incredible how much patients will share with their physicians and how so many barriers are broken down inside of a hospital room. I admired Dr. Harper's ability to pause and ask difficult questions. I loved that she portrayed the humanity of her thought processes - she *could* leave the room, end her shift, and go home, but rather she stays and has those difficult conversations. I think this memoir has further solidified that I am not interested in emergency medicine, but I was impressed by how Dr. Harper was able to connect with her patients despite the pace of the ED. I also was interested to learn more about how things work in the VA because you don't often hear much from the VA. That being said, I do wish that the patient stories were a bit more connected to Dr. Harper's life. I found myself getting lost in Dr. Harper's story - although the stories were told somewhat chronologically when Dr. Harper would return to details of her life outside the hospital I was confused about where we left off and how the patient connected to her own story of healing. The epilogue tied this together a bit better, but overall the stories she chose to tell felt disconnected from her life. I also felt like the dialog was a bit contrived, but I guess unless you're writing a memoir in real time you won't have the exact words recorded. I liked reading this memoir while thinking about the kind of doctor I want to be. I hope to identify problems within the system and then advocate for change... though not every physician's career involves advocacy, I felt dismayed by the gaps in the story where I felt like something should have been done. I got fired up by a moment where someone remarked 'that's just how our system works' and that was the end of the discussion - why does it have to just be like that? Anyway, overall a really interesting read, and I'm happy to have read it. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Dec 27, 2020","Dec 29, 2020","Aug 31, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50043108-the-beauty-in-breaking

While it is clearly written for a younger audience, it did a good job of exploring themes such as mental health, identity, and familial struggles.

When I heard the good news, I couldn't wait to get my hands on a copy of The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. I loved a lot of things about this book, but in the end I think it fell a bit flat for me. I think it is a solid 3.5 star book, but I rounded up because the OG Hunger Games trilogy is amazing. Despite its length, I found myself reading it pretty quickly. However, I was often thinking ""wow this book is getting pretty long,"" which makes me think that maybe some of it could have been condensed or that the pages could have been used to flesh out other sections or plotlines more fully. It was a good, fast, and interesting read if you find yourself craving more HG content, but otherwise I am not sure I would recommend it. *some itty-bitty spoilers below* One of my favorite parts about this book was having a behind-the-scenes view into the development of the games. It was really cool to see what Panem and the Capitol were like 10 years after the war and try to connect the dots between the HG then and the HG now. Seeing how the HG might have evolved over time made it easier for me to believe that the ""present-day"" Panem could exist. It was interesting to watch the HG as a spectator rather than a tribute in the arena, but there were definitely parts that seemed to lull a bit (though the 10th anniversary HG were much different than the 74/75th HG and the reader's experience is probably similar to what someone in the Capitol's experience of watching the games would be like). I liked that a lot of the last names were familiar and we were seeing the way that family lines hold power over multiple generations in Panem. I will say that the references to future books started to grate on me by the end- especially in part 3 (ESPECIALLY with the katniss reference). I also found almost none of the characters to be particularly interesting or likable (except maybe Sejanus, and maybe Tigris but she plays such a tiny role). I also got really bored of Lucy Gray's songs by the end. Overall, I had the most trouble with Coriolanus' character development. I thought he was really wishy-washy at the beginning and that his main personality trait was that he was concerned about his public image. He had some interesting internal conflicts about doing the right thing vs. doing the Capitol thing (which sheds light on how your upbringing really shapes who you are and how easy it is to be brainwashed by the Capitol- even in its weak post-war state) but then diving into part 3 he was suddenly this totally unlikable character who seems to do the Capitol thing 100% of the time. His last moments with Lucy Gray were nothing short of confusing and it felt like Collins realized she was nearing some sort of page limit and decided to just throw everything into 20 pages at the end. (An aside: his relationship with Lucy Gray was also really forced from the beginning IMO). I did like the resolution of the book because I could see how Coriolanus could become President Snow over time, but I thought it happened way too quickly. I'm still trying to connect some of the dots, but perhaps Collins will write another prequel to help clear up some of the remaining questions....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"May 26, 2020","Jun 09, 2020","Jun 01, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50794839-the-ballad-of-songbirds-and-snakes

However, I found the book I started this book expecting to fly through it and love it because it won a Pulitzer Prize (which in hindsight was silly). However, I found the book pretty hard to read. This was mainly because of the content (I could not get myself to read through some of the horrible acts of abuse unless I was fully committed to feeling sad at that moment), but it was also a bit because of the writing style. I found myself rereading sentences over and over again to make sure I didn't miss the point; it was a bit too convoluted for my liking. It was the first time that I had read something about these reform schools and it was shocking to me that places like this one actually existed. A lot of really relevant and important themes were explored over the course of the book and I learned a lot even though it was a fiction novel. The plot itself was absolutely carried by the twist at the very end (it was genius, good work Colson Whitehead!!). I originally gave it a 5 star  because I was so excited by the twist, but in coming back to  the book more thoroughly 80% of the book felt like a 4 star read for me so I am dropping a star. ...Coming back later to write a more comprehensive  but I like this quote “the boys could have been many things had they not been ruined by that place.

I liked that this book explored relationships that aren't ones I've been exposed to - specifically polyamory.

I feel like it let me down a bit. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Mar 21, 2020","Mar 23, 2020","Mar 02, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/40914165-the-book-woman-of-troublesome-creek

I was weary of it at first because I think the concept of time travel has been done so many times before, but this was a fresh (enough) take on it to keep me interested. Writing both a linear and a nonlinear narrative is tough to pull off, but the author was very smart about it (keeping the present Oona aware of only what she should be aware of, introducing characters in smart ways, putting pieces of the puzzle together in the right years). It’s cool how the reader knows only what present day Oona knows. The drive to figure out what happened in the past really keeps you reading (also a smart move to have her first leap be so far into the future- setting so much up that needs to be uncovered). There was a good balance of some years being long and some being short, though the book seemed to accelerate at the end. I will say that the book didn’t have very much substance and the life lessons it tried to convey were pretty cheesy. Oona also seemed to really live in a bubble, not being affected by anything that happens in history/the real world (i guess maybe some people are able to live that way anyway, but given the importance of time in this book it seemed a bit one dimensional). But for a fun read, it’s hard to find too many faults. Although I did find the twist kinda meh.

I loved that each character was connected, but it wasn’t done in a cheesy way. I found myself wanting this book to go on forever. I wanted to know more about each character, see their problems resolve, their goals realized, but the ending really was perfect. It left the reader feeling similarly as one would in that situation (wanting more, lamenting life lost, etc.). I loved that each story worked within the framework of Native American history/current day struggles, and while I was reading fiction, I felt like I was learning and understanding a lot. I also loved the storyline of Dene making the documentary and how we were reminded of that every once and a while, but in the end the whole book could be read as the final product of the documentary.

It’s quite long, but the flow of the book makes it easy to read and each chapter being about a different character keeps you engaged. I liked that the connections between the characters weren’t overdone, they were often subtle or just that the characters existed in the same world. I also liked that not all the characters were super liberal. Each character had their own thing and it was cool to see how the author was able to pull that off. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Dec 28, 2021",Jan 2022,"Nov 08, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/41081373-girl-woman-other

Over the course of the trial so many little plot points are revealed and each piece of information complicated the story. I think I suspected each character of setting the fire at one point. That being said, I feel like I was able to guess what actually happened like 75% of the way through the book, so I was a bit disappointed by the “twist.” I thought the epilogue ending was unnecessary (didn’t need to have a “happy” ending).

Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha is an incredible woman/doctor/scientist/mother and it was really cool to see how her passion for the health and wellbeing of the children of Flint fueled the movement to solve the water crisis.

Thinking about my future as a doctor, Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha is inspiring- truly an instance of someone standing up and creating a team of people to generate change. While the book focuses mainly on the advocacy and activism, it always stayed connected to the human side. It was especially meaningful to me that Dr. Mona is a mother- seeing the way she balanced (or at least attempted to) her work and being a mother was really important.

I will say that it was somewhat predictable and while it dealt with a lot of very serious themes, it seemed to do so in a superficial way. So many big tragic events happened that I felt like weren’t fully explored and weren’t given the attention and detail they deserved. I thought the few passages from Matthew and Cora’s perspectives were a weird touch because they came so infrequently- it would’ve been better to keep it in Leni’s perspective rather than describing difficult feelings through someone else’s perspective (felt like a bit of a cop out). I wasn’t expecting this to be so much of a love story and that made the plot a bit more young adult-y than I thought it would be, but otherwise it was a good read!!...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Sep 26, 2019","Oct 02, 2019","Jun 21, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34927828-the-great-alone

I loved both a lot and I really liked having Paul Mescal (<3) and Daisy Edgar-Jones playing Connell and Marianne in my head while I read. The book and the tv show, while not 100% the same, are a really good pair and follow the same storyline pretty exactly (using a lot of the same dialog, too). The book filled in a lot of their behind the scenes relationship and really captured more of what was going on inside their heads. I think part of what moved me about this story was how real it felt. Rooney does a great job at portraying intimate moments (and how awkward they can be at times), and at building up Marianne's complex feelings. I thought the portrayal of anxiety- especially with Connell's contradictory thoughts (contradictory to his words/what he told himself) that he would try to repress- and depression was really real and there were times when this book made me wish I could reach out to them! I liked that the story is never fully predictable even though the reader so desperately wants Connell and Marianne to be happy (together). I also loved getting perspectives from Marianne and Connell and I thought the nonlinear timeline of the novel worked well. Definitely not as sexy as the tv show, but I still had the tv show fresh in my mind so that helped me fill in the blanks ;). I'm rewatching the tv show now and, who knows, maybe I'll reread the book. Love books/tv shows that can make you feel something and this definitely did that! ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"May 09, 2020","May 13, 2020","Jan 13, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/37539457-normal-people

I was expecting to really love it because I have heard nothing but good s. However, I was somewhat underwhelmed. The story is, of course, amazing and inspirational and so sad, but the writing was dry and unimaginative. I understand that it must be difficult to recreate someone’s life story and it was clear from the author’s note that this was no easy task, but the story lacked the passion that it deserved. It is incredible knowing that this is a true story and I was so moved by the pictures that were included at the end. Knowing that these horrific things took place so recently is tragic.

I was immediately drawn to the characters and found this so easy to read. This book explores a lot of really interesting themes like identity, family, poverty, race, religion... all within the context of 20th century Japan (/Korea). I had not been exposed to this part of history before. I learned so much about Japan during and after WW2 and the tensions that existed between Japanese and Koreans. I also thought it was really interesting to learn about how Korea split into South and North Korea, but mainly through conversations between the characters in the novel (no one ever explicitly explains what happened). I really love reading books that are historical fiction, but make history seem approachable and easy to digest. *minor spoiler below*Seeing the main characters struggle with what it means to be Korean or what aspects of their identity they chose to identify with was really fascinating. I loved seeing how cyclical history is and despite some of the characters' attempts to reject their family ties, they ended up right back in the same profession/situation as before (perhaps I'm reading into it, but it seemed like a small comment on how racial injustices put different populations at a disadvantage from the start). I loved how clearly the complexity of familial relationships was portrayed and I really felt like I could sympathize with many of the characters in this book. Min Jin Lee does not make these themes difficult to see- they are written in plain language and took no extra analysis from the reader. That aspect was a bit overdone, but I appreciate that the reader had to do less work to get the point. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"May 17, 2020","Jun 03, 2020","Aug 24, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/35099568-pachinko

That being said, Angela Davis wrote a really informative, super interesting, easily readable book about a topic that I think everyone should be educated on. The criminal justice system permeates everyone's lives, yet few people understand the injustices and the complexities involved. Davis's book outlines a lot of very important topics in a very manageable 115 pages. Although the book does not solve the problems, Davis does present some very tangible steps towards prison abolition, which left me feeling somewhat optimistic about the future of the criminal justice system.

The first half, describing his journey to medicine, seemed relatable -- the seemingly never-ending academic battle, constantly striving for perfection. While reading this, I was inspired by Paul Kalanithi's words and believed that I would be able to work hard and conquer whatever it takes to become a doctor. Then, at times, I was fully convinced I would never be strong enough to do it. What Paul Kalanithi describes about med school and residency seems like the 100% real deal. He describes the 90 hour work weeks, the nights where he would almost pass out while driving home, and how many of his friends ended up dropping out for better lifestyles. Honestly, the descriptions of anatomy lab kind of freaked me out -- Kalanithi describing how he was waiting for a breaking point - a time where cutting into someone's body would hit him. I was worried that when I get to med school I won't be able to handle what is coming. What shines through in his writing, however, is his devotion to medicine and helping others and that is something that I think I share. Although the descriptions were real and I know it's going to be hard, I think this book played a role in reminding myself why I want to do it. This book made me think about a lot of things I haven't put much time into thinking about: life, death, transitioning between life and death, what you would do if you had a tangible timestamp on your life... what it really means to be a doctor. I loved this book and highly highly recommend it to anyone, but specifically anyone who is interested in becoming a doctor.

I have been WAITING for this book to end just so I could write my . Disclaimer: this  in NO WAY changes my opinion of To Kill A Mockingbird. That will forever remain a 5 star book. Go Set a Watchman barely had a glimmer of a plot. At points I thought it was going to turn into something, but it just continued to be Jean Louise ranting on about nothing. It should not not not be a sequel to TKAM. The inconsistencies were very hard for me to read and I was very very upset with how Harper Lee developed her characters. The whole appeal of Jean Louise (formerly Scout) was her innocence and how she naively does whatever she wants. Her as a grownup does not have the same appeal and makes me not interested in her as a person. Also not sure if I'm missing something but the couple paragraphs in the book where she switched between 3rd and 1st person really made it seem as though there was no editor that read through the book. There were many unnecessary plot additions, too much fluff and not enough substance. Switching between the past and present doesn't help the fact that there was no plot and the Jean Louise I loved in TKAM is so different. The stories told from the past have nothing to do with the present and the topics switch way too dramatically. Never before have I had to blatantly skip to the end of a chapter because it was so god damn boring. Harper Lee is a great writer as always and the writing was beautiful, there was just nothing keeping me reading.SPOILERS BELOW:HATED the relationship between Jean Louise and Henry. Needed more information about what happened to Dill (maybe that's just the romantic in me that wants Scout to end up with her childhood love?). Also, wtf happened to Jem? Hated that Atticus was such a good guy in TKAM but is a part of the KKK now. The entire fight that Atticus and Jean Louise makes me hate Atticus. All of the characters try to validate the fact that you can be good and be a part of the KKK but like no... Although it may not have been about Atticus being pro racial equality in TKAM, he definitely did not participate in the hate like others did. Again, disliked the character development... Makes me hate Atticus! Didn't like the ending, didn't like the possibility that Jean Louise would move back to Maycomb. I liked the parts about Jean Louise's past (where she thought she was pregnant, the story of her going to the dance with Henry). Although they didn't make sense with the ""plot"", they made me remember why I liked Jean Louise so much -- the ever innocent Scout. Yes, in the end I realized that the world isn't what it seems and people suck, but it took me 278 pages of reallyyyyy tough reading to get there.

I truly found most of this book unsettling and uncomfortable. I thought that it wasn't super well-written and all of the relationships/dialog felt fake and forced. But then, halfway through I decided maybe these stilted and awkward (unconvincing?) relationships are what the future that depends on technology as the centerpiece to humanity holds? I think maybe I'm reading into it. I found Mae's obsessive tendencies annoying and hard to read, but maybe that's what made her the perfect character for her role in The Circle. Francis was UNBEARABLE, Mercer and Mae's parents' relationship was... bizarre? Annie and Mae hardly seemed to be friends at all? Anyway...It was interesting to see the points that The Circle proposed that I started to buy into- some proof that this dystopian reality is maybe less far-fetched than we might hope! (I will say there were only a few of them and most of the ideas were very wacky). The ""twist"" was not that surprising, though it did add some intrigue. I would give it 3.5 stars probably but rounded up because it was a supremely easy read and I flew through it. This has been on my bookshelf for a while now, so I'm happy I finally got around to reading it. Dave Eggers is really a smart author to come up with all of these believable yet freaky ideas. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"May 05, 2020","May 08, 2020","Jun 11, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18302455-the-circle

At first, I found it hard to get into with the chapters being so short and flipping between the two different worlds, but as I got deeper into it I really loved both Werner & Marie-Laure and found their characters so intriguing. I especially love how Werner is technically the bad guy, but the reader grows to love him. The last 100 pages were incredible and I couldn't do anything until I finished the book. I liked that we got some perspectives from the future at the end, but there weren't any unrealistically happy endings. I also liked the plotline about the jewel and the myth about it - I thought it added a level of fantasy to the story. I'm looking forward to watching the show (perfect timing - I had no idea it was coming out!). I think overall I give 4.5 stars, but will round up because it is a unique story about WWII and I really enjoyed reading it. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Oct 24, 2023","Nov 17, 2023","Jun 07, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18143977-all-the-light-we-cannot-see
