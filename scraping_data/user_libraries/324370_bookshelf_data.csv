In this title, London-based art historian and curator Hessel combines the upbeat appeal of her podcast The Great Women Artists with solid scholarship to spotlight a diverse cast of women artists from the 16th century to the present who threw off constraints, broke new ground, and made exciting work. Although she follows a conventional timeline from the Renaissance through the contemporary art scene, Hessel casts a wide net, with forays into themes from Spiritualist art to textiles to Afrofuturism, and consistent attention paid to political and cultural contexts. Hessel provides a lively brief of each woman’s life, work, and background, along with an intriguing image or two that will whet readers’ interest to discover more. Artists range from well-known to obscure; even the most seasoned art enthusiast, educator, or scholar will find surprises.

The book is near-future dystopia, a very dark take on the carceral industry, where death row has been monetized as a hyper-mediafied, merchandised, blood sports economy. It's harrowing because it's plausible—the games these folks are coerced into competing in are essentially public lynchings updated for the streaming era.

Also very thought-provoking in a confrontational way, and I found myself needing to stop reading periodically and just check myself as to what I was thinking about what I had just read.

It’s super cerebral and full of puzzles and threads to tease out—the kind of book you can think about for a while after finishing. The plot is minimal: a 50-60ish painter who lives alone is contacted by an old grad school acquaintance, Martina, about an experience she had while in a stressful situation, hearing voices that said “Curfew or Curlew. You choose.” Martina remembers the narrator, aptly named Sandy Gray, as being a clever interpreter—in grad school, of an e.e. cummings poem—and thinks she can help. The narrative then spirals out of linear form—there’s an intersecting story line of a 16th-century Black Death–era young woman metalworker; Sandy’s father, whose hospital stay for a heart attack is complicated by Covid restrictions; and Martina’s two very weird 20-something daughters, who muscle their way into Sandy’s house and life.It’s surreal and yet makes sense if you read carefully. As the middle of the three chapters makes clear, everything in the book is some kind of binary (there is a nonbinary character, one of twins—a bit of wordplay in itself): there are the plague/Covid eras, the aforementioned twins, and the contrast of artistry/craftsmanship vs. the superficiality of Gen-Z mores and speech. If this is Smith’s Covid-era “kids-these-days” indulgence it’s a fun one, though I found the craziness of the two daughters a bit more heavy-handed than the rest of her storyline. To balance that out is a surprisingly sweet and very apropos through line of kindness, how being decent to people and forging connection is problematic, yes, but also necessary, and that being kind to animals is an unambiguous good and will always serve you well in life....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Aug 21, 2022","Aug 24, 2022","Aug 21, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/60026567-companion-piece

The protagonist, a career mercenary who lives well outside the boundaries of society, never quite has an official name; he calls himself the Barely Blur, a nod to his shifting identities, but averages out along the way to Will—the principle of self-determination being something he grapples with throughout the novel. He’s deeply damaged, and does some terrible things, but he’s the kind of character Chaon writes so well: amiable, a bit befuddled, thoughtful right up to the point where his introspection can take him no further. Will is jogged out of his track as a cog in a dark network when a woman claiming to be his daughter—the result of a series of sperm donations he made for the money as a young man—manages to track him down (wonderful image of a bucket of burner phones suddenly, and horrifyingly to Will, all vibrating). There ensues a bit of a road movie, bit of a shaggy dog tale, bit of a musing on the limits and uses of paranoia in a vaguely dystopic near future (which is not all that far removed from the present day, honestly—lots of surveillance and shadow societies in the mix). But Will is also one of those characters that Chaon writes so well, introspective and slightly bemused, damaged but with a solid core of decency.

Rather, it was a reread—I think I first read it when I was in my early 20s, but so much of what makes it a really meaty novel just went right over my head. Which makes me marvel at how truly oblivious I must have been at that age, despite having been raised in a reasonably aware liberal household and living in NYC. I just wasn't a political animal, I guess, because the big themes she shifts around with her eight or so main characters—class and sexism, mainly, with a little anti-Semitism and racism thrown in—did not weigh in my mind at the time, as I remember.This time around I found it all fascinating and horrifying, as well as an entertaining read, a slow burn of amusing, annoying, satirical, and then appalling—kind of a rear-view-mirror dystopia, published the year I was born and all the more unsettling for that intersection into my own time line. Especially given the recent Supreme Court rollback of Roe... it's not as far back in the rear-view mirror as I'd like it to be, these days.Anyway, too much going on in the book (Vassar grads in the 1930s moving through young adulthood, trials both of the time and timeless, and some really awful men) to describe, but it's worth a read for sure.

Altogether a very interesting, smooth read, and definitely recommended to anyone who likes this sort of thing. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jan 24, 2022","Jan 31, 2022","Jan 26, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/58764487-in-the-field

The novel is ostensibly a fictionalization of the life of Friedrich von Hardenberg, the romantic poet who wrote under the pseudonym Novalis. But it's more a tragicomedy of manners, painting a fascinating little portrait of the 18th-century German aristocratic intelligentsia—Goethe makes a cameo—with a really delightfully arch tone.

Jackson and Hyman also wrote for The New Leader, where I worked for a few years in its last days in the early 2000s.

I'm generally a sucker for dogs in titles so of course I was going to read that one.

It starts out feeling like it might be one of those NYC comedies of manners, which I like anyway, but then it gets really interesting and a little dark-while-still-being-fun about a lot of big subjects, among them aging and sexuality, agency and consent, and who gets to say what, exactly, gets to happen in the name of art.

It isn't about the suspense, really, since you know Highsmith wrote four more Ripley novels, so he obviously survives to do more dark deeds in the world. Rather, the fun is all in watching Ripley—a big baby of a psychopath gallivanting around the mid-'50s Mediterranean—twist in distress and then brighten up again, over and over, as he thinks his gig is up and then turns out to have fooled everyone yet again… which essentially gives the reader a little taste of the joys of psychopathy, for what it's worth.

Joan Silber takes on the question with her usual deft touch here, though without ever addressing it head on. Beginning with Ethan, a young Manhattan lawyer who discovers that his father has a second family, Silber unspools a web of lovers, siblings, parents, and children, from Greenwich Village to Bangkok, whose searches for fulfillment ripple outward in unexpected ways. From the entanglements of Ethan’s half brothers in Queens to his new boyfriend’s dying ex, whose sister watches them care for him warily even as she rekindles an old flame, to a young filmmaker living with her mother’s regrets and her sister’s capriciousness, each set of choices—infidelity, caretaking, the rejection of parents’ values and money, the work to build an extended family based on love and loyalty—affects the others in ways both subtle and large. Silber moves easily in and out of her characters’ heads; the novel is deceptively airy yet, given a reflective reading, has an ethical center without the shortcut of easy morality. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jan 05, 2021","Jan 17, 2021","Jan 05, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54338144-secrets-of-happiness

The concept was interesting—how the South Bronx in the 1970s and '80s became this overarching symbol for urban devastation and ruin, and how that was interpreted/misinterpreted by artists and in popular culture. It hit a lot of notes for me personally: urban studies and the Bronx in particular (I live in the North Bronx, an area that never fell into disrepair), high/low art, inclusivity—but fell short in a few ways. Most notably, although the book discusses how the reality of life in the S. Bronx of the time was othered or omitted from the examples L'Official featured, from really problematic pop culture like Fort Apache, the Bronx or Bonfire of the Vanities to more open-ended art world treatments like Gordon Matta-Clark's deconstructions taken from demolished Bronx buildings or the half-ironic gallery Fashion Moda, which had a storefront in the S. Bronx for a while, he gives hardly any space to actual S. Bronx voices, other than novelist Abraham Rodriguez. I get that he feels hip-hop and graffiti and all their associated offshoots, have already gotten a lot of exposure as the voices of the Bronx, and I realize that that story wasn't the book he set out to write. But it still feels slightly inconclusive framed that way—I get a strong sense of a series of individual articles strung together. The book is also on the academic side, a bit too rooted in cultural studies artspeak formalism to be a joy—I felt like I was back in art school in 1985—and it was a slow read for me. What I did really enjoy was the overlay of 2020 tech, plugging the addresses L'Official offered as typical rubble-strewn lots of the time and seeing how they've been rebuilt now—a lot of polite, well-kept townhouses and typically anonymous low-slung brick retail stores that look pretty much the way they did then, but cleaned up. And it did give me some things to think about, not just in regards to the Bronx but the narrative of urban spaces and New York in particular, and my own (very white, very young, very hungry for sensation) experience of NYC downtown in those same years. I'm glad I was there and lived through that, but it's good to consider centered in the wider world—which I most decidedly did not do, then. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Dec 12, 2020","Dec 26, 2020","Dec 12, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/54830349-urban-legends

In her memoir Golem Girl, published in October by One World, Riva Lehrer offers it as a disability archetype, and more—from dust and mud, a shapeless mass breathed into life as something magical.Lehrer was born with spina bifida in the 1950s, a time when chronic disabilities often consigned children to institutions. Instead, her mother—a former medical researcher—made sure she had a formidable education, a rich life, and the medical care she needed. An artist from an early age, in college Lehrer was hooked into disability and queer politics and advocacy, and how these could converge in her own work: “One of the only epiphanies I’ve ever really experienced,” she explained. “It was like falling in love with an entire country.”Lehrer has gone on to a rich career as a portrait artist and a teacher, exhibiting widely and holding instructor and lecturer positions across the country; she’s currently on faculty at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and instructor in the Medical Humanities Departments of Northwestern University. Golem Girl, her first book, is a deeply kind and exhilarating look at where experience, belief, vision, and compassion meet—and why. Bloom’s Lisa Peet had the pleasure of talking to Lehrer in November about how, exactly, that works.*Lisa Peet: First off, how are you doing during this strange time of COVID?Riva Lehrer: I am, as far as I know, still alive. When this first hit, I was terrified that I was going to start losing friends, because so many of my friends are disabled. But what ended up happening, so far, is that we all took it really seriously, and we weren’t the people out there wandering around doing risky things. Most of us deal with medicine on a regular basis, and if we didn’t believe in the reality of science, how many of us would still be here?The hardest thing, and I just wrote an essay for the Times on this—I’m a portrait artist. For 30-something years I’ve had people in my studio, or I go to them, and they pose for me. They’re very long, intimate sessions, which mean the world to me. And I can’t do any of it. I’m trying to figure out what my life can look like. The essay is about having face hunger, about not just losing the faces of other people but losing my own. I’m 4’9,” I walk with a limp, my spine is curved, I’m unusual-looking, I’m now 62, and I’ve always used my face as a way of mitigating or managing how people react to my body. Now when I’m out in public, I don’t have a face anymore [because of having to wear a mask]—I’m just this body, and people react to me differently.LP: How have you been dealing with the lack of in-person contact in your work? So much of it is collaborative.RL: I’m about to start a portrait of Rosemarie Garland-Thomson, who’s one of the top people in disability studies and bioethics, and to do that I’m hiring a photographer in San Francisco who is going to do reference photos. I hate working that way—it’s both technically and emotionally unsatisfying. But I don’t know how long [the pandemic] is going to last, and it feels important to do this because I’m going to be documenting what we’re all going through, which is yearning to see people—being blocked from seeing them, trying to understand what a relationship is from a distance through technology, having our memories of the faces of our loved ones now be flat and framed in glowing squares. It feels appropriate at the moment not to give up, because this is the moment where we’re all trying to see faces.LP: You talk in the book about your creative process—the politics and advocacy behind it, your thoughts on the bond between artist and subject, and your struggles to get it right. Does writing about making art come naturally?RL: I’ve been teaching at the university level for more than 20 years. And when you are teaching visual art, especially once you start working with upper-level students, the thing you have to learn to do is to take information that’s completely nonverbal and verbalize it. It’s a long process of learning how to use language to talk about something that isn’t language—so that was good training.Most of my work is narrative, especially the stories of other people. When I do artist statements and I’m putting down information about self-portraits, I almost always just say “self-portrait,” but when I’m talking about the portrait of someone else, I try and condense something about who they are. It’s a mixed experience, because part of me sometimes wants people to have no information and just encounter the image. But because I feel an obligation to my collaborators, the point is communicating their presence in the world. I’m always involved in something visual that I have to turn into a story of some kind.LP: When did you decide to write a memoir, and why now?RL: It started out kind of as a document. I had arranged with my family to be my executors, and I thought if anyone wants to find out about my work, there should be a coherent document that my family can use. I started writing that, putting together lecture parts and stuff that I had done. [With] the lectures, at times I would use very personal stories to make a point, and people liked them. So as I was gathering the stories of these other people, my story kept getting dragged into it.And something came up and I thought, I should ask somebody in my family about that—I’m not sure what actually happened. I can’t remember what it was. But whatever answer it was that I got, it was something I had no idea about. So that led me to try to talk to the older members of my family before they weren’t around anymore, and that’s when I started finding out a lot of stuff about my mother. That’s what really got things going.I talk about being constructed by medical people and by my mother, but if I had never gone [to my first meeting of the Chicago Disabled Artists Collective], if I had resisted going and told Susan [Nussbaum] No, forget it, my life would be completely different. As I started writing, it got really clear to me that what I was trying to do was write a book about how we treat each other as embodied beings, and how we pressure and manipulate each other into conforming so that our own anxieties are set aside. That’s more important to me than the story of Riva Lehrer. I’m not that interesting. But I think that some of the experiences I’ve had can help people think about their own embodied lives, and those of people around them, and maybe have a little bit more freedom, or at the least self-knowledge.LP: I would really like to see this book, with its wonderful vein of radical body acceptance, in the hands of teenage girls (and probably boys) everywhere. But who were the readers you were thinking of when you were writing?RL: That was tough. If I had written this just for people with disabilities it would be a completely different book. I knew I was writing both for a general audience and for people in my community— including people in the queer community, not just the crip community. I would write it for the general reader, but then I would nod as much as I could to the people in my own community so that it wasn’t just what we call Disability 101. There’s a fair amount of 101 in there—there was no way around it, like the chapter about [disability] language. I couldn’t not put that in, partly because it was such a transformative thing for me, making the point that you get a different set of words and holy shit, your perceptions just turn inside out.LP: You’ve been making art ever since you were young, but have you always written?RL: No, not like this, though I’ve been writing lectures for 30 yrs. That was actually one of the hardest things about writing this, because there’s an explainy voice in my head when I sit down to write, and I didn’t want that. I wanted story voice. Finding story voice took me quite a long time.I had a good initial editor, Goldie Goldbloom. Goldie’s fantastic, and I did a few private sessions with her and then I took a couple of group workshops, and I read a lot of memoir and memoirish stuff to think about when I cared about a story and when I didn’t. It took me 6-1/2 years, and if you saw the early versions it would make your head hurt. So I was not writing like this out of the gate.It was interesting—I started to hear a noise when it was bad. I would hear this noise in my head when I would reread something, almost literally like a warning bell, except more like a bunch of broken bells all going off at once. Not literally—I wasn’t having audio hallucinations—but it was close to that. And I started to trust that, that when I started to reread something and I felt like that noise was coming up, it was a problem.LP: How hard was it to pitch the book?RL: I’d been invited to apply for a MacDowell [Colony fellowship]. I thought, I’ve never had time to write more than maybe a couple of hours a week—I wonder what it would be like to have several weeks where you’re just writing? At the same time, I was invited into a really prestigious studio program here in Chicago, and I had to make a decision. If I did the studio program it was a two-year commitment, and I knew I’d never do the book then. So I asked them if we could delay for a couple of months to let me go to MacDowell.Toward the end [at MacDowell] I did a reading of an early version of the Winter Walk chapter, about mom’s surgery. I told people about being invited into the studio program, and I said, I need you to be really, really brutal and tell me if I’m basically a hobbyist—that’s OK, I’ll go do the studio program, this has been amazing, I loved meeting you all. I had no perspective. So I did it, and everybody was like, No no no no, you have to write this, which I had not expected. In the middle of all that Rosemarie, whose portrait I’m about to start, called me because Peter Catapano at the New York Times had been doing this series of people writing on disability for the op ed pages, and said, I want you to write an essay.So the essay goes out. And unbeknownst to me, my best friend, Audrey Niffenegger, sent it to her agent without telling me. Her agent, out of the blue, calls me and says he really loves this, and it says at the end I’m working on a book—is that true? And I’m like, Kind of? It took us about six weeks to put together a book proposal. I didn’t even know about book proposals. It didn’t even occur to me to look for an agent. He sent it out to his people and it started to go to auction, and then there was a pre-empt by One World. It was all a shock. When he called me, I was teaching a class at the School of the Art Institute—we were over at the museum. I pick up the phone and he tells me what they paid for the book, and I passed out in the gallery of European painting at the Art Institute of Chicago. I woke up with my largest male student holding me, going, Are you OK?LP: Are you working on something new?RL: I am. Fiction this time. I’ve never done fiction before, so this is even stupider. I don’t know if I’ll pull it off or not, but I’m going to try.LP: What are you reading now?Some of my favorite writers are David Mitchell, who has become a friend. Richard Powers. My favorite semi-recent memoir is H Is for Hawk, by Helen Macdonald. I used to read a lot of mysteries—now most of them really bore me, except I still love Tana French. I read Heavy, by Kiese Laymon, We Cast a Shadow, by Maurice Carlos Ruffin—that was great. I just picked up the new Susanna Clarke, but I haven’t read it yet.I like books that take a genre and do something fresh with it. And I like books that take me someplace I haven’t been. Chris Adrian, I love him. Hilary Mantel, Lawrence Wechsler. Philip Pullman’s actually really influential for me, mainly because of my obsession with symbol and metaphor. One of the things I think about how that stuff works—I feel like you have to earn your symbolic structure and your metaphoric language. Pullman is somebody who understands how to earn your metaphors.LP: In the book, you’ve done a great job communicating about where your art intersects with your disability and queer activism and your love of storytelling. I like hearing how that fluidity has entered into your writing—can you talk a bit about how your sense of narrative informs your art practice?RL: One of the last installations I did, the painting of Carrie Sandahl in BDSM gear, I did at a museum where on one wall it was just [the portrait of] Carrie with two speakers. Her partner, who’s now her husband, came and taped every single one of our portrait sessions. Sometimes he was there and sometimes he just left the equipment. So we had hour after hour of our conversations, and the speakers were playing snippets. And there was a whole wall of documents that she and I had done separately, talking about the experience of spending an entire summer with each other, and about our experiences of embodiment, or pain, or sex.And then in the far corner I took the chair and the heating pad and the footstool and the little rolling table, the physical setup that Carrie had sat on during our sessions. Our disabilities are not the same but they’re similar, so I was taking care of her physical needs very much in the way that I take care of my own. I wanted the presence of that comfort corner, the proof of the care I was taking of her, and the sense of intimacy—just this little chair with a bunch of pillows on it. It felt very homey. And for opening night, I had plates of the cookies that she liked to eat, and mugs of the tea that she liked. I wanted to pull our relationship into an equal place, along with the actual result in painting, so that anybody in there would be thinking about what it was like—not just to sit for me but to have that be such a long period of deep exchange. The person isn’t just sitting there like a houseplant. They’re talking.What I value are the connections I make with the people. That’s the point of what I’m doing. What drives me crazy is that when you see a portrait in a museum, you just see this picture of a person and the artist seems to be gone, and the relationship certainly doesn’t seem to be there. For me, it’s the relationship that’s changed my life. It’s the exchanges I’ve had with people.

There's a large cast of characters, including a Hilda and Rupert, a bourgeois, slightly smug middle-aged couple; their spoiled Oxford dropout son Peter; the husband's sweet and insecure younger brother Simon and his slightly aloof partner Axel; Morgan, Hilda's extremely neurotic sister just back from the States and her completely hapless ex-husband Tallis; Tallis's bitter, nasty elderly father; Leonard and Julius, a manipulative, vaguely evil-but-charismatic academic who toys with everyone.

I wouldn't exactly call it a feel-good novel, since bad things happen to decent people and the worst characters emerge to go on with their lives, but there's a tiny (two or three sentences, blink and you've missed it) reveal toward the end that completely changes the reader's understanding of one of the central characters. It's also notable for her portrayal of the central gay couple as the most sympathetic and stable (and, in a way, decent) of the lot, coming only three years after the decriminalization of homosexual relations in Britain. Maybe not notable for Murdoch, but I imagine it was a breath of good air for a lot of folks reading it in 1970.

My slow reading was about library holds that showed up and book club books up for discussion, and no detriment to this very interesting panoramic picture of the pandemic that encompassed the history of immunology, virology, and medical education, as well as wartime politics and some great portraits of the scientists and doctors involved. Barry's style was a bit much—he never met a rhetorical repetition he didn't like—but it was worth putting up with for the story and info. And honestly it's not the worst thing to hear a historian's voice underneath the facts, as long as he's accurate—and I get the feeling Barry's research was very thorough. His afterword, which he wrote in I think 2018, is downright chilling—he essentially says that the biggest challenge to the next great pandemic will be governmental cooperation and the honest dissemination of accurate information. Granted, Trump was president when he wrote that so he may have had a better idea of possible scenarios than he would have in, say, 2015.

And I use the word enjoyed, rather than liked, on purpose—it was a thoroughly fun read and I did like it, but I'm also fascinated by Murdoch's talents for: plotting (especially set pieces), description, evoking characters (I won't say character development because most of them don't develop anywhere, but she certainly can set them up), and one of the best dog/human relationships I've read in a while. You could say that's actually the central love story, since Murdoch's human affairs aren't particularly touching—think Shakespeare's characters all running around in the woods hooking up with the wrong people (thanks, Iris Murdoch Fan Girls Book Club, for that image). And the nominal sex is awful. But everything else is pretty wonderful, and it's interesting to see how Murdoch pieces all together. The ending is more uplifting than I remembered, too, and sweeter in general. Though speaking of pacing, one thing that I get a kick out of is the way she interjects these little philosophical treatises into the narrative. It reminds me, if Ms. Murdoch will beg my pardon, of the way middling erotica is set up: you have the story line, and then the doorbell rings and it's the plumber, which sets the scene so everyone can have sex, and then they're done and the rest of the story goes ahead until there's another bit set up for the express purpose of more sex—or in Murdoch's case, more philosophical discussion—etc. It's quite charming....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"May 26, 2020","Jun 09, 2020","May 26, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11324.Under_the_Net

The storyline was a good one—corporatized music as a symptom of post-pandemic ills, and those of an alienated, segmented society in general. But what captivated me most was how Pinsker, who wrote this well in advance of the onslaught of Covid-19 (it was expanded from a story in her 2019 collection Sooner or Later Everything Falls Into the Sea, and was published in September 2019), got so many of the social isolation details scarily right. She spins that out into an exploration of what happens when public gatherings are banned, music is channeled into mega-retail AI channels, and live music is forced underground. It's a great premise, superimposing the rise of giant corporate entities with American fear, and how a desire to stay safe can become stifling legislation—very punk rock. But what may have felt more like an allegory when Pinsker wrote it is a sharp what-if right now.

I love how she accomplishes that POV that swoops and darts, alighting on first one person and place and time and then another, and making it all work narratively.

I can’t remember the last time I spent this long on a single book, which I’ll chalk up to losing my two-hour-a-day commute, and also to the fact that about halfway through, I discovered the excellent online Wolf Hall book club over at the Washington Post. I’ve been spending almost as much time with that discussion as I did with the book, and since it runs through May 11, I’ll be going back to it. I have to say, this was a great read/reread for me right now, though—I needed something that would absorb all my attention and take my head away from the world of 2020. And I just adore Thomas Cromwell as Mantel has written him. Maybe not something I should admit so readily, but I relate to him in a way—his ambition, his regard for social capital, the way he works to balance his pride in what he's made of himself and his strengths and his intelligence with the gentle parts of his nature. Obviously I'm not responsible for burning people at the stake, and hope my personal balance sheet comes out better than his did, but there's something about him that clicks with me. And the writing is absolutely brilliant from start to finish.It’s been a bit weird, in a nice way, to see that what I think of as my own very personal choices are actually part of a larger social distancing zeitgeist. All those people reading Wolf Hall makes sense, I guess—like me, a lot of folks probably got their hands on the long-awaited third book of the trilogy and decided they wanted to start from the beginning. Finding out that my friends and I weren’t the only people reading Virginia Woolf was also kind of a neat surprise (“Why Anxious Readers Under Quarantine Turn to Mrs. Dalloway,” in the New Yorker)—and as post-pandemic Modernist literature that celebrates running errands, that adds up too.

I was pretty much the only person out of all of us who didn't care much for it, which makes me think I'm probably the wrong audience. I don't care for self help literature much (OK, at all) and I was hoping for something a bit more political. Some of her statements, especially around greed, rang really false, though of course I can't speak to her interpretation of her own experience and I realize she was looking at this through a relationship lens rather than a socioeconomic one. But the places where she separated out greed from poverty really tossed me out of the mix. I did like the chapter on loss and grieving, where she talked about how mourning long and hard is an appropriate reflection of the love you felt for someone:Love knows no shame. To be loving is to be open to grief, to be touched by sorrow, even sorrow that is unending. The way we grieve is informed by whether we know love. Since loving lets us let go of so much fear, it also guides our grief. When we lose someone we love, we can grieve without shame.That's something I think about a lot of the time these days—I'm still very much immersed in sadness for all my loved ones I lost in the past year, and I don't really feel like I should be ""getting over it."" It actually feels appropriate and right that I'm this sad (and to be clear, I'm not depressed—feeling this way isn't keeping me from being productive and involved in life, or at least as involved as I can be in a lockdown). So I feel clear on that, but it's always reassuring to hear the sentiment from someone else. She had some interesting stuff to say about love and power, also, but again—wrong book for me just now.

It's at least somewhat autofiction—the narrator, also named María, is an art critic in Buenos Aires, as is the author, and she's said in interviews that there are some overlaps with her life, but only some. Whatever the case, the book is a really well done set of very loosely linked chapters that take off from the idea of how looking at art, and thinking about it, intertwines with a person's life (and often changes it). She's a very good art critic to begin with, so her thoughts on the artists who are part of her stories—from Rothko and El Greco through more obscure and local painters—are really interesting, but also very accessible. There's also a very sub-subtext that caught my eye as a writer and researcher, which is where and how do you get to depart from the record and start building your own story? She's obviously researched these artists very closely, but there are also wonderful textural details about their lives that she could have totally woven in herself. Or not—I was toggling back and forth in Wikipedia and WikiArt to look at the pictures and artists Gainza was talking about, but at a certain point I (and probably most readers) will just sit back and take the narrative on faith, so those authorial nuances are always fascinating to me. Anyway, if you like looking at art and thinking about it past the moment when you're standing in front of the canvas, this is a lot of fun. Very fresh, I thought. And the translation, by Thomas Bunstead, is excellent. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Mar 02, 2020","Mar 07, 2020","Mar 02, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/42077222-optic-nerve

But it's still horrifying, because Atwood has set up a scenario between now and then that is believable, if not probable, and is perhaps even more so now.But gee, even it runs out of steam a bit at the end, which I didn't remember. I'm not sure if it's that denouement, with its clever little jabs at academic symposia—though one thing that hadn't registered when I was in my 20s was that it was also a vehicle for showing how that kind of casual, jokey misogyny made its way so quickly back into normal discourse (or: had never disappeared from it outside the borders of Gilead).

The narrator, Mona, is somewhat of an aimless hot mess in her early 20s, cleaning houses, taking photographs, collecting odds and ends (both human and inanimate), staying home alone a lot, and musing at length on everything that crosses her path, But she's not really a mope so much as dry and prickly, even as regards her neglected, abusive childhood. Beagin's decision to stick to the third person is a good one, I think, taking the sharpest edge of indulgence away from Mona's voice. But what kept me along for the ride was the fact that you never had any idea where it was going at any given moment—a refreshing place to be as a reader. Also, I'm always interested in personal takes on housecleaning, fictional or non-, and Mona's engagement with what she did was all about the act of cleaning itself, rather than any class or societal implications—so, obviously fictional, but kind of intriguing nonetheless. This read more like something I would have been into in my 20s, a disaffected Denis-Johnsonish type narrative, but young and female, and in parts I found myself annoyed by its haplessness. But overall the novel was just so weird that it stayed in my good graces. Even the format—four extremely loosely linked long chapters—made sense as a way to narrate a clearly very episodic life.

And it was absolutely worth those 912 pages for the comprehensive overview not only of Douglass's fascinating life but of the period and the very fraught courses of abolition and reconstruction (both of which are commonly defined to sound like contained processes, and both of which were anything but). Blight paints a thorough picture of the politics of the day—not simple, to say the least, but really worth taking the complex, deep dive. I'd venture to say that there's really no way to drive home the nationwide (and beyond) horror of slavery and the multiple ways it was embedded in the culture, economy, and political and personal life of the day without going into that kind of depth, and even if Blight waxed a little purple here and there, it was overall a very nuanced, empirical examination of a hugely knotty movement.

Schilthuizen presents an interesting overview of urban evolution—how plants, insects, birds, and animals have adapted to manmade/urban environments—in an extremely digestible way that doesn't skirt the fact that this is serious business. The tone tends to default a little onto the side of breeziness, focusing on urban fauna and flora's successful adaptations to issues like noise, light, and chemical pollution and the compartmentalization of cities' green areas without digging into the more disastrous and deleterious effects. Then again, this is not that book, of which there are already many. This is, rather, an optimistic—but no less rigorous for that—look at the ways nature (both what we think of as ""nature"" and the kind touched by humans) prevails. Schilthuizen's style is conversational and often very funny, keeping the array of information moving along: why mice in urban pocket parks have developed different DNA; moths whose wing colors changed to provide camouflage on the soot-covered tree trunks of industrial-age England; plants that filter heavy metals; the difference between rural and urban blackbirds, who do in fact sing in the dead of night (to avoid daytime city noises—and that's not the only sly Paul McCartney reference Schilthuizen works in); and the ultimate irony—how the post-Darwin transformation of the Galápagos capital of Santa Cruz into a tourist destination has resulted in enough urban homogenization to slowly reverse the differentiated effects on the bills of ""Darwin's"" finches, which are what led to its fame to begin with. Lots to learn here, and it both goes down easily and sticks in the brain—the author presents his information well and usably.

And yeah, easier said than done—particularly, done well. But Friday Black is very much that sort of work for these times, and a terrific, unconventional read. Adjei-Brenyah's stories are smart, sharp, often harrowing; about anger, race and racism, consumerism, guilt, culpability, violence and its seductions, and the fierce pull of human decency against all of the dark matter. His voice and style are highly original—nothing here is in any way predictable. And while no catharsis is handed to the reader, there's still a sense of release to reading them, which maybe lies in his intelligent handling of all that complexity.

The book takes readers through the life cycle of the featured projects, from initial challenges through brainstorming and design to the assessment of the finished building. Each chapter includes three essays: input from an administrator or board member involved in planning, including basic tips for successful teamwork; the architect’s evaluation of the project’s needs; and a staff member’s appraisal of the completed job’s strengths and weaknesses. While projects don’t include a range of economic variables or community types—all are financially stable East Coast institutions—the challenges are interesting, running the gamut from severe space limitations to irregular site constraints to requirements for stylistic consistency while meeting 21st-century usage needs.

At its surface level the book is a twinned narrative involving a discovered manuscript and a contemporary academic who annotates it heavily (and personally) as he transcribes it. But there's a whole lot more going on, particularly in the manuscript, which is ostensibly a biography of the early 18th-century English folk hero Jack Sheppard—who was the model for Macheath in John Gay's The Beggar's Opera and later Brecht and Weill's Threepenny Opera—and his prostitute/moll Edgworth Bess. But aside from being a rollicking retelling, it's also a queering of the legend: in Jordy Rosenberg's retelling Sheppard is a trans man (as is his modern-day professor Voth), Bess is Southeast Asian, and one of the main characters is a gay black man. But beyond even that set of identity politics, which would be innovative and entertainingly loaded on its own (Rosenberg is a trans man as well), there is a lot of really interesting subtext—on colonialism, big pharma, academia, archival authority, racial and gender identity and rights, industrialism, commodification, medical ethics, slavery, and I'm sure I'm missing something else. You get the idea, though. For the most part Rosenberg pulls off this hyper-intersectionality, and mainly he keeps the energy rolling along. Voth's personal footnoted drama can wears a little thin at parts, although I'm sure it was written to, and there is some overly neat—and slightly wtf-inducing—consummation of Voth's intellectual odyssey toward the very end. But this is a fun, thoughtful, prickly read. Rosenberg absolutely goes big here, and it's worth your time if you're up for it. (This is not, obviously, a beach read, unless this sounds like your idea of a beach read—it is mine, or would be if I ever got within ten miles of a beach—in which case, have at it.)...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jul 09, 2018","Jul 14, 2018","Jul 09, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/37779607-confessions-of-the-fox

Which sounds incredibly simplistic, but to Saslow's credit the book is never melodramatic, didactic, or dumbed down—nor is it sensationalistic, even when laying out the foundations of the White Nationalists and how they spin their particular brand of nastiness. The story takes place at a very human level, and what actually drives Black's transformation is the compassion, and persistence, of his peers. Which sounds almost too good to be true but a) Saslow is a good reporter who obviously had full cooperation from his sources, and I believe him and b) Black was such a star of the White Nationalist movement because of the family he was born into, but also because he was very smart, very inquisitive, something of a polymath. Whatever other enormous ideological flaws his parents had, they apparently raised him to seek out the answers to his own questions, and he did. It's actually pretty encouraging for these dark times—that such great personal change can come out of simple actions: kindness, patience, the exchange of ideas. I know, crazy talk, right?

It hit a bunch of my sweet spots: history as viewed through a specific lens, particularly events that happened in my adult lifetime, and early punk rock. In this case, as the title would indicate, the book focuses on the fall of the Berlin wall and what part was played by the early punk movement in the DDR and eastern Europe, from 1981 through 1989. Mohr has good sources in addition to opened Stasi records, which he admits are pretty dry, and his narrative is very engaging—he's obviously making sure his voice matches up to the subject, without falling into total inarticulacy, so lots of short sharp sentences, sometimes repeated like song choruses, and plenty of profanity. As someone who was involved in the downtown NYC punk scene starting in roughly 1981, I was fascinated by the contrast. Note that I ID what I was part of as a scene, rather than a movement—it may have stemmed from adolescent (and post-adolescent) rebellion and a dislike of conformity on my end, but it didn't carry the same kind of life-and-death charter—no one I knew was going to jail for their beliefs (other than for public intoxication, maybe), or having to dodge police to make the music they wanted to make or attend concerts or marches. So even though I know my history and have read a fair amount about the end of the DDR and the Communist regime at the time, this was an interesting filter to drive home the import of what a lot of young people were dealing with there and then.

This starts out full of righteous female anger, very much of its time—not #metoo so much as #allofus. But the second half gets heavy. Albertine has the opportunity to read both her parents' diaries after their deaths, chronicling their angry and abusive relationship before their divorce—a chance most of us should feel fortunate we don't get. Albertine progresses through and processes several layers of realization as she reads, especially when it comes to her mother—the central figure in her life besides her daughter—who was always a source of strength but, as Albertine comes to understand, a wellspring of great dysfunction, and for good reason. This kind of Rashomon-on-the-couch could be oppressive, but Albertine's voice is so great—profane, funny, literate, and self-deprecating—it elevates the book into an interesting study of what happens when we uncover family secrets, and how to consider them in light of being a fully-formed (or as much as anyone can ever be, which is actually a parallel theme) adult.

Handsome, slightly oversize, with high production values and lavish photographs and illustrations, it could be taken for a coffee-table book. But this would do it a disservice, as Library of Congress historian Cole has compiled a thorough overview of the library’s history, with an exhaustive time line ranging from President John Adams’s 1800 act to appropriate $5,000 “for the purchase of such books as may be necessary for the use of Congress” to the 2016 swearing in of current Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden, accompanied by well-written essays. The chronology offers detailed accounting of the institution’s construction, collection building, division development, staff, outreach, cataloging and computing innovations, and ever-expanding mission. The essays zero in on subjects and events such as the library’s role after John F.

While I liked Meg Wolitzer's intro on reading short fiction in the age of Trump, she didn't get to what struck me as most notable in the collection, which is that so many of the stories had sexual power plays at their center. Particularly interesting given the huge buzz around ""Cat People,"" Kristen Roupenian's recent piece in the New Yorker, which was all about that—sex, but not so much the sex itself as the power dynamics, how those sands continuously shift between two people. I wonder if it isn’t tapping into a certain zeitgeist right now—granted, the stories in BASS were all written in 2016, before Trump took office and this year's outcry against sexual abusers, but if you want to see culture as a barometer for the times (sometimes I do and sometimes I don't), these issues have been simmering.

And here I am 53 years later still in love with it, so I guess I can blame him for all this thinking about writing in the first place.ETA: *43* years later!

This would be that, not quite a takedown but a very dispassionate look at Darwin as a self-promoter and builder on others' ideas, when it comes to ""his"" theory of evolution, without giving due credit. I'm going to reserve judgment on his argument until I get to the end, though I don't think it really holds water. But it was interesting in theory, anyway. Enormously well-researched, to the point where it kind of shows overmuch sometimes—Wilson gives context for his contexts—but I did enjoy the very extensive road map of the science of the day, which is an interest of mine (and why I'm ing it in the first place).

Hard to say without having finished, but it feels like all the disparate parts are building to form some kind of modern fairy tale, but doing that takes a little more... let's say concision.

I always think ""tour de force"" is such lazy er-speak, but Habash has done a really fine job. The whole novel is voice, and he sustains it all up to the end, sometimes a touch over-written but mostly spot on—I can't remember being so bowled over by a book about drive and determination since, I don't know, I read The Old Man and the Sea when I was 13? Stephen Florida is a great character, determined to win a college wrestling championship and that's IT in his life… but he's about much more than that. Fear, for one thing, and how someone without a lot of emotional ballast operates alongside it. And how difficult it is to build and rebuild a successful sense of self, which is not so much about self-aggrandizement as the small adjustments and moves you make—OK, I'll bite, much like wrestling—to give yourself a different stance when the one you're using turns out not to work so well. Florida is bombastic and vulnerable and smart and dumb and near-autistic in his total solipsism—but aware of that fact, too, and the whole package is pretty wonderful.I couldn't help relating a bit, too—should I even admit that?—to his drive, and the sensation that everyone else is just flapping their hands while you've got your head down, working. Maybe especially at this point in time… the novel seems like a great backlash against a phenomenon like Facebook (which I'm really loathing these days), where everyone seems to be falling all over themselves to document how mediocre, banal, trite, dysfunctional, and/or privileged they are. Does no one aspire to greatness anymore? Well, Stephen Florida does, and I love Habash for giving him to us. Someone else read this and talk to me about it!

I did like the world-building off the bat (which sent me to reread the first chapter of Kevin Brockmeier's weird and wonderful The Brief History of the Dead), but found the hand of authorial research on the heavy side (I think I hold all historical fiction up to how E.L. Doctorow's Ragtime expanded my 14-year-old head). What injected the needed degree of soul for me, though, was the Buddhist subtext (and sometimes text—cf. chapter XCIV) on suffering and sorrow, and the reminder that much of living involves entering into the suffering and sorrow of others—in the novel's case, literally, which might have struck me as overly crafty at another time but, just now, I'm totally OK with. The historical ""climax"" was pretty heavy-handed. But I still felt more uplifted than not.

The creepy villain here isn't something supernatural popping up out of the sewers—although there is a potential serial killer at large, and a few elements that might be supernatural or might not—but rather the totally destabilizing effects of loss and how that in turn opens up cracks in our psyches for all sorts of evil to get in.

Reading My Name is Asher Lev at age 12 flipped that switch for me, and I always really enjoy when a writer takes on what goes into the act of creation (reading about writers doesn't do the same thing for me... maybe because I identified as a visual artist early in life, long before I ever thought of myself as a writer?).

At the story's base there's a murder—a matricide—but it isn't there to be solved, although one of the protagonists invests much energy in getting at its emotional core. Rather, there are a lot of twinnings that are pulled apart and the wound examined—sisters growing apart, parents and lost (both figuratively and literally) children, marriages, unconventional friendships, even an amputated leg wracked with phantom and emotional pain. Ruskovich stays on the side of the implicit, rather than spelling out her connections, and this makes for a tension that carries the book through what might otherwise be a distracting series of time and POV jumps.

Both the writing and translation are lovely, which serves to hammer home the way violence—maybe especially when it's political in origin—has implications for years and generations afterward. The book is a series of narratives of ordinary people caught up in the student uprising and military massacre in Guangju, South Korea, in May 1980, beginning with one 15-year-old boy and spiraling outward, including an arresting author epilogue. It's not an easy or comfortable read—a lot of it is very violent, encompassing human acts ranging from torture to the tender washing and dressing of anonymous dead bodies—but it's a strong and I think necessary one.

In one of the later chapters, ""The Factory Girl,"" as events in Guangju ramp up—the rise of a militaristic leader to fill the power void left by an assassinated president, the institutionalization of media censorship and misinformation, and the violent arrests of protestors, the young narrator says:Through the newspapers, you witnessed the seemingly inexorable rise of Chun Doo-hwan, the young general who had been the former president's favorite.

Because while yes, reading is good for a body and mind and goes a long way toward canceling out the mind-numbingness of TV, I don't think people who are capital-R Readers are necessarily any better than anyone else.

Let's see... kind of like Grimms Fairy Tales meets Wisconsin Death Trip meets Samuel Beckett meets a DDR Spoon River Anthology... oh, I don't even have enough references to triangulate with.The book takes place over the course of one night in a little East German village, and there's no plot to speak of. The subject is basically how all of history is made of people, places, and stories, using the hyper-local to comment on the bigger picture. But where a more sprawling novel with that kind of focus would be called a tapestry, the scale of this one makes me think of a hand-drawn map, with all its oddities and beauty. It's contemporary and at the same time mythical—both within the modern narrative and the interwoven centuries-old legends—full of wonderfully black political humor, quirky without being cute, dreamlike and mundane. Definitely one to reread, and I don't reread often—I really wanted to start over right away, but I'll let it sit and percolate a bit (plus I want to suggest it for a books-in-translation book group I might join and if so, I'll reread it then).The lack of plot means this isn't for everyone, but if it sounds like your kind of thing it probably is....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Sep 20, 2016","Oct 14, 2016","Sep 20, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/26889828-before-the-feast

Weaving together decades of scientific studies of fish consciousness, cognition, and social structure, ethologist Balcombe (author of the lovely The Exultant Ark) offers a picture of fish(es) as complex and sentient beings. Not only do they have acute senses of sight, hearing, and smell, they have the capacity to feel pleasure as well as pain, and some form hierarchical grooming cooperatives, hunt in interspecies packs, help raise nonbiological offspring while waiting their turn to fertilize eggs, or recognize each other after months apart. At times the recitation of “believe it or not” knowledge bites can feel like overreaching to make a point; at others Balcombe edges toward a decidedly unscientific whimsy—he never met a fish pun he didn’t like.

And this was definitely that. Marra's portrait of a corner of post–Cold War Russia is well-written, informative without being didactic and touching without being sentimental. He sets the scene in the first story, of a photo retoucher during the Great Purge, and moves on to a multiple portrait of large and small lives, getting by (or not getting by) post-1990. The Chechen War figures prominently, and the rise and fall of the oligarchy, all the rippling out from 1937.Even the places where I thought Marra might lose me—the title story, in the middle of the book, flirts a bit much with clever tossed-away aphorisms in the way Gary Shteyngart can put me off sometimes—but the humanity in the stories shone through enough to reel me back in.

So imagineI can’t very well talk about my best books of the year until the year’s over, and I had one last book to finish up on the last day of 2015. So imagine my delight when I opened up Colum McCann’s Thirteen Ways of Looking this afternoon to find the collection’s second story beginning:He had agreed in spring to write a short story for the New Year’s Eve edition of a newspaper magazine. An easy enough task, he thought at first. In late May he settled down to sketch out a few images that might work, but soon found himself struggling, adrift. For a couple of weeks in early summer he cast about, chased ideas and paragraphs, left a few hanging, found himself postponing the assignment, putting it to the back of his mind. Occasionally he pulled his notes out again, then abandoned them once more. He wondered how he would ever push into the territory of a New Year’s Eve story—create a series of fireworks, perhaps, drop a mirrored ball in a city, or allow snow to slowly scatter across the face of a windowpane?Descriptions of writers trying to write what we’re reading can be tiresome—hey, if we’re reading it, he wrote it, now, didn’t he? But McCann keeps his touch light, and besides, who can resist a metanarrative like that? The writer assembles his characters and the faint outlines of a plot, a Marine in Afghanistan calling home to South Carolina:[S]he will simply pick up the phone, she will dial through, she will call her lover and her lover’s son, and she will simply say, “Happy New Year,” in the most ordinary way, and they will return the greeting, and life will go on, since this is what our New Year’s Eves are about, our connections, our bonds, no matter how inconsequential, and the story will be quiet and slip its way into its own new year.And it does. Thirteen Ways of Looking is a tight and nicely realized collection—one novella and three short stories—and its small size means that McCann can play with a few themes at one time without the whole muddying to some shade of literary brown. There is, of course, the Wallace Stevens poem that gives the book and its opening novella their title, “Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird,” each stanza of which opens one of the novella’s 13 sections. There are also, literally, ways of looking: at someone, for someone, at a surveillance tape, through the scrim of memory, through the haze of old age. (“Oh, the mind itself is a deep, deep well. Lower me down and let me touch water,” intones the elderly gentleman around whom the title story centers.) And McCann offers a way of looking at loss as something that’s not a consummation but a refraction—how it can be given us, then taken away, then granted again.There’s not a lot of joy in this collection—in an Author’s Note in the text and on his website, McCann discusses how the book was shaped by an assault in 2014, when he was attacked and injured on the street by a stranger. Yet it’s hopeful, in its way, by virtue of the fact that not one of these tales wraps up neatly. McCann’s resistance to any kind of tidy conclusion speaks to what is, often, better about life than fiction: anything can happen, and usually does. The story doesn’t end just because the page count is finite, and there’s always room for the unexpected.It’s a good thought for the new year, and Thirteen Ways of Looking was a good book to ring out the old one. “How do we look out into the dark?” McCann asks the apocryphal New Year’s Eve piece’s readers. That’s a good question for pretty much any night of the year, and a good reason to keep reading....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Nov 30, 2015","Dec 31, 2015","Nov 30, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25229229-thirteen-ways-of-looking

The beasts and the children here—every story features at least one of each—are not in good places. The children are at the mercy of self-absorbed and narcissistic adults—misled at their best, and often cruelly negligent—and the beasts are at the mercy of children and adults alike. Anyone who knows me knows that I have little stomach for children in peril, and even less for endangered animals (I know it should be the other way around, but that’s how I’m wired). And there were a number of points early on in the book where I just thought I’d have to put it down. But the writing is wonderful—strong and innovative—and the stories feed into each other in a way that ramped up my attention, not so much linked as braided, a few strands that come together as the book progresses. The publisher’s blurb invokes Lorrie Moore, Claire Vaye Watkins, and Rebecca Lee—which, along with the fabulous cover, is certainly why I picked up the galley in the first place—and some of Parker’s bemused, slightly sad children’s voices remind me a bit of early Ellen Gilchrist.

And very global representation, much less of Granta's Brit-centricity.I like a lot of the choices he made in terms of tempo, up to and including ending it with a longish, dryish piece by Lydia Davis on teaching herself Norwegian by reading a 400-plus page experimental Norwegian novel from start to finish. That piece is really kind of marvelous, very meta, because the more she goes on about getting pulled into the minutiae of the language the more the reader gets pulled into the minutiae of her process... it's one of those essays that shouldn't work but does. At least it did for me—it'll probably put off people looking for a more breezy, popular kind of essay. Maybe that's why he put it at the end, so you can just put the journal down if it's not for you and not miss the rest. But I thought it was a slow starter but neat.

It's marketed as YA, and as such has its moments of elision when it comes to Shastakovich's life, not to mention the Siege of Leningrad—this is not a big fat history volume. But it's informative, and if I had read this as a high schooler for a WWII history class I think I'd have gotten a sharp, interesting picture of the time and politics. Anderson also gets points for weaving commentary about his source material into the narrative and stressing the awareness that any history is pieced together from facts of various degrees of reliability. Some of the writing's a little hyperbolic, but some of it is just terrific, too, and often very affecting. Recommended, though if you're a Shostakovich/wartime Russia historian it might feel slim.

Strange book, and though I was interested enough to read to the end (after the first third, which was a bit of a slog), I'm still a bit divided about it. I thought the setup, which is kind of The Handmaid's Tale meets Watership Down meets 1984-slash-Animal Farm, was interesting. And I like what she took on with world-building—in this case a beehive. But the storyline got repetitive in places, which ended up making the social commentary feel heavy-handed, and that kind of thing is always better in less-is-more mode, as far as I'm concerned. Also it was somewhat hard to latch on to the main character, especially once the drones—the males—came into the picture and were given all personality in the story. Which I realize was the point: the hive is full of female bees that are basically interchangeable within their given roles, and this is what happens when one bee breaks out of hers. I get it. But there was something slightly off-putting about the males being the only really interesting personalities, at least until the main character's hubris kicks in. But in spite of those complaints, it kept me reading. The world-building was a lot of fun, and the fact that the world was a beehive was fascinating in itself. I think, in the end, what flattened it for me was how little humor or any sense of irony there was. Even a serious book has room for a bit of edge, and I wish there had been more. Still, it was such a different book—which ultimately kept me reading straight through, so kudos to Paull for pulling it off....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Aug 07, 2015","Aug 14, 2015","Aug 07, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18652002-the-bees

Talk, which was originally publishedElsewhere I described this as my literary summer soundtrack, and I’m not sure I can come up with anything better. Talk, which was originally published in 1968, is the transcript of three friends talking to each other out in the Hamptons during the summer of 1965—originally a number of friends taped by Rosenkrantz, distilled down to two women and their gay male best friend. They’re in their late 20s/early 30s, involved in the 1960s New York art scene—Andy Warhol and Henry Geldzahler are name-dropped—and all, as was the fashion, in analysis. The conversations veer from banal to deep, self-important to involved, trite to interesting, and cover a lot of bases where sex, art, food, and relationships are concerned. It’s just delightful, even when the speakers themselves get tiresome—it’s the rhythms of the conversation of friendship that make it work. There’s a kind of music to it, even when the reader thinks—often—that they’re all slightly narcissistic and immature. But aren’t we all sometimes—and even more to the point, don’t we all have those thoughts about our nearest and dearest, even as we still love them? Talk is like that, and it swings along cheerfully even as it takes some dark turns.

More precisely in Sjöberg’s case, the study of hoverflies, family Syrphidae. While flies may not seem the most lyrical of topics, as the author admits, they are an access point for a book-length riff on facets of the human condition that interest him: the urge to collect and classify, the freedom inherent in a highly limited field of study, ambivalence about travel, loneliness, persistence, joy. Loosely organized around the story of Swedish naturalist René Malaise (1892–1978), inventor of the titular fly trap, the book is not a biography—nor is it a monograph, scientific treatise, or narrative. Sjöberg free-associates, yet manages to string his musings together in a way that keeps the book bobbing gently along and doesn’t edge into self-indulgence. What The Fly Trap is really about, in Sjöberg’s words, is “the creative imagination that characterizes artists and good scientists.”...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"May 31, 2015","Jun 20, 2015","May 31, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23164961-the-fly-trap

As a modern good-evil parable, it missed—the evil was just too evil, and the good too good (morally, physically, financially, and in the possession of fabulous first names). The psychological exploration of how life damages a soul was well-done, but for all the type expended on the dynamics of long friendships, they didn't always jell for me—maybe because two of the four friends fell out of focus about halfway through and that synergy never quite came back (as it will in life, granted, but this was maybe too important a part of the plot to give over to realism). I'm not sure I bought the whole setup, for all its emotional pounding. But it was very well-written—Yanagihara's voices and rhythms work well together, and for all its heft and length the book flowed nicely. Still—I think I was as glad to get to the end as some of its characters were. Maybe that was the point. Glad I read it, though it was a bit of a painful reading experience.

It's a good exploration of family dynamics, particularly in the Philip Larkin mode—to a lesser extent how brothers and sisters bounce off each other, though that aspect never went into that much depth for all the wordage expended on it.

The book has several very different facets: it’s a memoir of Macdonald’s journey through her grief after the death of her father; a tale of falconry, with lots of thrilling technical descriptions thrown in; and an exploration of the life of T.H. White, who wrote The Once and Future King, The Sword in the Stone, and a small, bleak, but beautiful little book called The Goshawk. Which, in fact, I read several years ago and hadn’t thought much about since. But Macdonald has been thinking about it from the time she was a child, and when she gets a goshawk of her own—the wonderfully-named Mabel—as an attempt to combat the numbness of mourning, she revisits the book and its complex, often very sad, author. If this sounds to you like too many moving parts to make a coherent whole, you would be wrong. It is a wonderful, very three-dimensional, very aware portrait of a time in one person’s life. And Macdonald’s writing is just gorgeous, whether she’s describing her interior self, the natural world outside, or her goshawk—who manages to bridge both states believably (but not un-self-consciously; some of my favorite musings are on our dependence of capital-N Nature as a metaphor).This is an excellent, very grown-up book—the kind that lets you walk around looking at your own flawed world through that particular prism of wonder, which is really the biggest kindness a book can do a reader.

Trampoline is one of those—not just well written, which it is; and not just visually appealing, which the wonderfully deadpan black-and-white drawings make sure of; but there is something deeply lovable about it, an undertow of affection you couldn’t fight if you wanted to. Or I couldn’t, anyway. Coming-of-age stories are supposed to do that, aren’t they?—make you love their young heroes or heroines, no matter how difficult they might be. And most, I find, don’t. But Gipe has done it with 15-year-old Dawn Jewell, growing up at the end of the '90s in a poor Kentucky mining town with a sprawling (in more ways than one) dysfunctional family, as well as loyal and not-so-loyal friends, drugs and moonshine, strip mining activism, car wrecks, Black Flag on the radio, and a sympathetic DJ. And Gipe deftly avoids every single cliché that could trip such a story up, which includes having a pitch-perfect ear for dialect and making it into something marvelous. There are arrests, fights, bad reputations—""When they showed up, it was like it started raining washing machines. Things got broke.""—and fierce scraps of beauty pulled from anywhere Dawn can find them. Trampoline is a wonder.

But I found it to be a very smart and measured contemplation of the ways in which we view our bodies, health and illness, our immune systems—the term is recent, a 1970s construct—and particularly the subject of vaccinations. Within that, she brings in a lot of interesting cultural touchpoints: Bram Stoker’s Dracula, Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring, the history of inoculation, and the etymology of the metaphors we use for disease and the body—it’s a little surprising to note how many of the terms come from warfare.

The story was interesting, and the manner of telling it, from varied points of view, should have really sparked it. I mean, a chronically lovelorn and disappointed cross-dressing French patriot turned Nazi collaborator? With supporting characters that included a Brassai-like photographer of Paris' seamier side, a sexy but celibate countess, and a Henry Miller type literary rake who managed to cash in on his disappointment with the bright lights of late 1930s Paris, a neurotic and possibly unhinged biographer? But there was something a bit arms'-length to the whole thing. Even with a great cast of characters, and knowing that each was supposed to be unreliable in his or her own way, the storytelling was lacking a certain traction; it never quite carried me along in the way I would have liked.

We love trees with universal and unfeigned love, and all things that do grow under them or around them – the whole leaf and root tribe.” ― Henry Ward BeecherWhen it comes to wide-ranging framing devices, it’s always practical to look to the building blocks of the natural world: elements, weather, the birds of the air and the beasts of the field; all things spring wherefrom and such. And along those lines you can’t go too wrong with trees—“trees of life” having been relational allegories of choice throughout most cultures’ mythology, the Bible, and Charles Darwin, to name just a few sources. Trees as metaphors, trees as real objects, trees as ideal states of being—they’re pretty unobjectionable. So the question becomes, how do you use the fact of them in a dynamic way?Angela Pelster has put together a series of essays, loosely grouped around the subject of trees, in her recent collection, Limber. It’s a fine idea, essays that relate to each other from a central concept much in the same way that trees branch up and out from a root system, and in the way that we are connected to nature—and nature is connected to us—in forms both massive and tenuous. Pelster’s essays range from tales of actual trees—“The Loneliest Tree in the World,” austere in the Sahara; the tremendous Moreton Bay figs of Australia; or the limber pines of the book’s title, which grip rock faces by slotting their roots into cracks—to highly personal essays in which people take center stage, and the trees are incidental, such as “Portrait of a Mango,” a meditation that encompasses Vermeer, the color yellow, and her connection to her mother.Nature, predictably, has a starring role in many pieces, and these are some of the book’s strongest. Pelster knows how to showcase the natural world in all its hot and heavy glory: It was the kind of place with redwoods large enough to drive a van through, and where families of six would try to hold hands around a trunk but couldn’t. Everything smelled of rotting plants, of bursting spores and red dirt and moss. Mushrooms, big enough to sit on, bloomed from the sides of trees and the air was so wet you could suck the rain from it with your lips.In fact, Limber is strongest when it’s engaging straight on with the forces of the world, spores and wind and heartwood—the strangely alchemical substance at the core of a tree. Decay, as it should, has a certain pride of place in the collection, and as she points out, “Sometimes rot is gracious.” As soon as an animal’s heart stops beating, the chemicals in its body change and so its pH levels change and so its cells lose their structural integrity. They sway and crash like an old house in the wind. Cellular enzymes spill free from the wreckage and begin to eat away at the other cells and tissues, releasing more enzymes, more crashing, more destruction. Scientists call this autolysis: self-digestion.There are engaging meditations on mining, evolution, Bartholomäus Traubeck’s tree ring music, and a wonderfully unexpected turn on nuclear fallout in Russia; also some pieces that make you wonder why, exactly, they were included. An essay about a boy in a group home, presumably where Pelster once worked, is moving but doesn’t seem to quite fit, and another, “Inosculation,” feels like a stand-along short story. She covers a lot of ground here—a lot of forest. And while there are some compelling overriding themes, such as her interrogation of the religion she was raised with, which she clearly both values and questions, and her shifting thoughts on fate, the center doesn’t always hold. If we’re going to keep on with the metaphor, the book is all branches and no trunk; it’s often a struggle to keep in mind that this is a themed set of essays.At the same time, the strongest pieces resonate. And if a reader is obliging enough to look at the collection as an ongoing inquiry into the constantly shifting places that nature, man, and God occupy, the book takes on a certain curious breadth. Pelster explains: I collect the signs like a doctor tapping on a patient’s body, looking into ears, pressing on a spine, drawing blood from the unseen places. It is difficult to know when one of these will come to something, when some bit of evidence will be made luminous in the beautiful light, when the world will bend and let slide a little secret from its corner.Not all the signs reveal what she’s aiming for. But many of the essays are quite beautiful, and spark some interesting trains of thought. Pelster is a fine writer, and a tighter collection might have thrown her thoughts into sharper relief.Some books, like wines, want pairing, and I’d love to see Limber—with its lovely rorschach-y tree drawings that separate each chapter—matched up with Thomas Pakenham’s Meetings with Remarkable Trees, a marvelous photo-illustration-essay collection that celebrates the things themselves, and their ineffable personalities. Even on its own, though, Limber is an often quirky, sometimes profound ramble through some interesting and diverse woods. Not to drag out the metaphor too far, that is. As Pelster notes, […] but who needs another tree metaphor about change and weathering the storms and remaining beautiful through it all? A tree is not a metaphor. A tree is a tree, and we are both only one strong wind away from falling....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Apr 15, 2014","Apr 23, 2014","Apr 15, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18406174-limber

But Wyld had control over all of them, and let the reader's darkest thoughts do a bunch of the heavy lifting as well—she did a good job invoking both the supernatural and the very, very concrete aspects of fear. The story opens with Jake Whyte, a young woman living alone on a British island tending to her sheep farm and doing her best to stay unnoticed and unallied, discovering that something has been killing off her sheep in a particularly ugly fashion. Wyld proceeds to set up a thick net of tension in both directions, narrating Jake's past in chapters that alternate with a very ominous present. The structure is interesting: present-day chapters move forward in regular narrative time, but the chapters dealing with her history move backward in jumps and stutters. There's something vaguely menacing about this setup, leaving the reader keenly aware at the end of each backstory chapter how much we are at the mercy of Wyld as a storyteller, and how dependent we are on action moving in one direction; there's a very final sense, at the end of each one, that we'll not learn any more about that particular part of Jake's life, though perhaps what went before might explain something. And to throw the reader just a bit more, the past sections are narrated in present tense, the present ones in past tense. It's all a clever setup, and Wyld has a steady hand with it. The story is well told, and Jake's voice is refreshingly straightforward. The whole thing was quite satisfying, scary and emotionally bittersweet without any sentimentality.

Kestin's protagonist, Dahlia Barr, is an Israeli Jewish human rights attorney who has made it her business for years to represent Palestinians. When she is persuaded to work for the Israeli Police Force arbitrating the use of ""extraordinary means,"" she finds herself caught between extreme political factions and family tensions.

This is a novel-in-letters between (mainly) two writers, ostensibly exploring the could-haves and might-haves of the relationship between Flannery O'Connor and Robert Lowell. The two did meet at Yaddo in the '50s, and struck up a mutual admiration society; and there are aspects of Bauer's two writers, Frances and Bernard, that parallel certain attributes—their shared Catholicism, a certain literary high-mindedness, and Lowell's drinking, womanizing, and mania. But I don't think it needs to be read with this correspondence in mind, and in fact I found it freeing to have allowed Bauer have been inspired by the real life writers and let it go at that. Frances and Bernard are fine characters on their own, and the unspooling of their mutual discovery would be wonderful no matter who the author had in mind.This was definitely one of my favorite books of the past 365 days—as it's only January 9, I can't claim calendar year without some serious faint-praise damnation. Bauer is a lovely writer, controlled and careful, and she has a great understanding of how to make the genre work for her story. Letter writing is a step up from journal writing in the informal performance department, and she gets the tone of her two characters—their respective sensibilities and social positions, the era, the place—just right. Plus there's a lot of very interesting banter about religion, and Catholicism in particular, which can be deadly with a tin ear but in this case was enchanting and enticing to this nonbeliever.Frances and Bernard made me want to be a better writer, and a better person, especially where the two intersect: write more actual letters, answer my email more thoughtfully, write in my journal more consistently, and debate important things with people I love without ever edging over into annoyance.

It's the tale of 11-year-old Fin, who goes to live with his beautiful and mercurial older half-sister Lady after his mother dies, relocating from the family farm in Connecticut to the Village with his collie Gus. Over the course of the book grows up into a teenager, negotiating both his own inner life and managing, as best a boy can, his larger-than-life free spirit of a sister. And that's about all you need to know. It's a sweet story—confectionary, as my friend Kat called it, though it's not cloying. Even the elements that would be inclined to annoy me in other hands—that it is, in fact, about a bunch of rich white people, and Fin is more mature and charming than any 11-year-old in history, and that there is a borderline Magical Negro character, the wise and kind maid, Mabel. But Schine has a nice light touch, and doesn't take herself too seriously, and it's hard to get too bent out of shape about a fairy tale.

A novel entitled My Education promises something along those lines too. We’re going to see someone learn something! Someone else, who’s not us. It suggests a spectacle, and for most of Susan Choi’s tale of impulsive love, it is—although not, ultimately, in the way you might imagine.The educatee in question is Regina Gottlieb, a graduate student in an unnamed literary discipline at an unnamed upstate university (you can call it Cornell if you want). The education she has in mind, though, is something a bit less academic. Choi doesn’t mess around; in the book’s opening sentence she throws us right up against the object of Regina’s intentions, the notoriously caddish professor Nicholas Brodeur. The fact that he’s got a terrible reputation and stands accused of numerous instances of moral turpitude, coupled with a case of extreme attractiveness, render Regina basically powerless not to pursue him. (Motives don’t figure heavily in this story, nor do they need to.) And pursue him she does until, at a marvelously uncomfortable dinner party at his home, she meets, makes out with, and promptly initiates an affair with Brodeur’s wife, Martha.It’s a hot affair, to be sure. It sizzles off the page. Choi knows how to write a sex scene, but it’s her bracketing—the lead-up, the dénouement—that reverberates. Consider Regina, after her first marathon roll with Martha:I felt the peculiar gratification of having been made a taxidermy of myself, disassembled and rebuilt with some sort of narcotic-soaked gauze densely stuffed in my cavities—I was that deeply satisfied, down to my marrow; all the bones in my pelvis seemed loosened and bobbling around.Just in case you didn’t catch it the first time around, this is good sex. But Regina is 21 and ripe for experience, whereas Martha is in her mid-30s, married with a new baby, and has no intention—no potential—to give herself over completely. Regina is passionate and obsessive, Martha is passionate and withholding, and not even the best sex in the world is going to remedy the imbalance of power between them. And herein lies the titular lesson: that youth and beauty, though excellent currency, are still no match for… well, anything, really. Regina exists in that classic American late adolescence where being a grownup is still a rumor, and all its trappings—the baby, the good car, the dinner party—dwell in some fabled shadowland. And while there are plenty of people out there who trudge dutifully in that general direction, from their teens through their 20s, until they reach it, there are plenty of us who needed to get there—if indeed we have gotten there—the hard way. I was half hoping in some selfish corner of my brain that My Education would bring back that visceral thrill of infatuation and lust, the joys of throwing caution to the wind, but the real elusive turn-on here turns out to be adulthood. As Regina puts it,I’d like to say I defied gravity just as often as feeling its snare, but my efforts were more likely spent clinging on with white knuckles to not be dislodged. Still, that was my heroism—my tenacious fidelity to her, though it was based on a grave misperception. I thought desire was duty. No trial could not be endured nor impediment smashed in desire’s holy service, or so I believed, with naïve righteousness. I didn’t grasp that desire and duty could rival each other, least of all that they most often do.And so we get to watch her crash and burn in the name of love, and because Choi is a fine writer it’s a pleasure—she does extreme drunkenness as well as she does sex, for one thing. Also because, if the reader pays any attention to names, she will know from the start that a protagonist named Regina (“Queen”) Gottlieb (“God’s love”) will surely survive. Ironically, this is where youth comes in handy: it may lead you to hit bottom, but chances are you’ll bounce. She bounces almost too conveniently well, in fact—eventually, after getting fired from a literary agency job, writing a purposefully lowbrow “young-girl-in-the-city rehash” that goes on to become an unexpected bestseller; marrying wisely, if not passionately; and being unexpectedly blindsided by the grownup version of hot passion, motherlove. But that’s OK. We’re rooting for her by the novel’s end, even if she is a bit of a pain in the ass.This is not Flaubert’s Sentimental Education, and Choi sidesteps any pointed sociological context. The fact that the grand love affair here involves two women is less a political point, or an effort to ground the story in a particular time, it seems, than a leveling of the playing field. The asymmetry between Regina and Martha has everything to do with their ages, stations in life, and motivations; gender is not part of this equation. My Education does end up being sentimental, though, almost unsettlingly so, and by the time Regina has made her version of amends for the various relationships she’s torn through, it’s tempting to miss the rest of the book’s damp messiness.But she has wanted adulthood so badly. She has lusted after Martha’s competence almost as much as her touch, yearned for capability and ripeness, which is what has made the book more than a fable of neediness thwarted. When Martha helps her furnish her first solo apartment, Regina gets a glimpse of what it is she really wants:Along with all these things of hers into my rooms had come a smell, encyclopedic and subtle, like a threadbare tapestry on some epic subject: her former lovers and gardens and meals and travels and sails and wounds and orgasms and perhaps even failures, a dusty and vegetal, floral and heat-baked and cool-moist and unnameable smell. The smell of her past, her past self, here where my self was seeking its future.In the end, it feels almost uncharitable to begrudge her the book’s smooth closure. It’s to Choi’s credit that Regina is more sweet than sour, and that My Education invokes more compassion than schadenfreude. It’s a complicated book, but a good one, and it’s not a terrible thing to be reminded of those days when the prospect of becoming a real live adult was still exhilarating....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jul 10, 2013","Jul 19, 2013","Jul 10, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16158566-my-education

People tend to flinch away from it even when an opportunity presents itself in real life—it’s an earnest kind of reaction, with no room for irony, and often the more difficult path. It’s no accident that religions invoke compassion as a stepping-stone to further enlightenment; it’s not always the easiest choice. As subjects for contemporary fiction go, it’s not particularly edgy—and certainly nothing anyone wants explained to them.But every so often an author manages to make a good case for decency in thought and action and to entertain at the same time. Simon Van Booy’s latest novel, The Illusion of Separateness, is this kind of book. Its premise is simple: that we are, all of us, connected in ways we cannot imagine. But Van Booy also spins out a good yarn to accompany it, and the message goes down easily. I am not generally a fan of books that want to tell me something that’s good for me, but there’s also something very refreshing—in these days of the ever-prevalent dark and weird—about a novel whose subtext is: be kind; be better than you think you need to be.Van Booy doesn’t pull out any authorial bells and whistles here. The story is built from a series of linked narratives that cross back and forth in time, told in gentle, pointed declarative sentences that are part Hemingway and part Brothers Grimm. Over the course of nearly 70 years, the lives of a seemingly random set of players cross, then weave, and eventually draw together: a solitary man who works in a California nursing home, a boy growing up in rural France in the late ’60s, a blind girl from Long Island, a young married World War II pilot, a Scottish film director living in Los Angeles, a German war refugee. Their stories are not particularly remarkable. Which is, of course, Van Booy’s point—that the fabric of the universe is comprised of small lives, and everyone is from somewhere:The sign in the distance once read Hollywoodland. Mules hauled thick poles up the steep ravine for mounting the letters. In 1932, an actress jumped to her death from the letter H. There were old-style cars parked along the boulevards. Men wore hats and beige suits. Everybody smoked and rode horses. The writer F. Scott Fitzgerald ate at lunch counters, and sat in a park near the tar pits, writing letters to his daughter, telling her not to spend so much money and to look after her mother.Not much happens in The Illusion of Separateness, but of course everything happens. A man puts a gun in another man’s mouth and doesn’t shoot; a baby is rescued and then given away; a little boy gives pastries to the homeless men in the park behind his parents’ bakery. People are lonely everywhere, and come together for solace, and find it: no surprise there either. The pleasures in this book are twofold, I think. The first lies in Van Booy’s storytelling, for it is exactly that: a series of fables for grownups, told in a spare and gentle language. He pulls out all manner of clichés and renders them not new but ordinary, as if to say yes, well—isn’t this is why they’re clichés in the first place? His interlocking tales are brazen in their refusal of novelty, retaining a certain innocence that has nothing more to prove:He would not have described himself as lonely, but would have admitted that something was missing. He often sat at his kitchen counter wondering what it could be, watching his dogs sleep, watching them breathe, their small hearts turning and opening like locks.Hearts come into play a lot here—not necessarily in a sentimental capacity, though Van Booy is an unabashed romantic, but doing their jobs pushing blood around bodies, and then, often, not. This is a mild novel, but also messy in the way life is, and affectionate about it all.And that’s the book’s second joy: that there is still, in this anxious and impatient 21st century, gratification in being reminded that kindness has its place. The book’s title and epigraph are taken from a quote by Buddhist teacher Thich Nhat Hanh: “We are here to awaken from the illusion of our separateness.” There’s a similar simplicity to the novel, if you’re of a mind or disposition to let it in. It’s not such a bad thing, the suggestion that we should try to remember to be nicer to each other. And not a little brave to take on in the current culture of fiction. This is a small book, and a kind one, and if it didn’t make me a better person, it certainly didn’t make me a worse one....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,Jun 2013,"Jun 05, 2013","Jun 01, 2013",,Unknown Binding,view (with text),/book/show/16065481-the-illusion-of-separateness

But I think Odalie did it, and that if Rose ended up psychotic in the end it was because she had been so thoroughly gaslighted. The bit about Odalie having lunch with each of the women she worked with before she settled on Rose was something of a giveaway -- she was looking for someone she could ""groom"" to do whatever she might need (I don't think she'd exactly anticipated running into Teddy but she must have known it could happen, and in general a minion is a handy thing to have). I think the insistence of everyone, especially the convenient shrink, that she WAS Ginevra is what drove her over the edge. She was wrapped pretty tight to begin with -- Odalie chose well. The Lt. Detective wanted to save her in the end but was just a bit too late. And speaking of which, all the little incidences that were supposed to hint that he had feelings for Rose were a bit heavy-handed… yeah, I got it the first time he perched on her desk.

Things weren't going well between us, to the extent that I felt more comfortable getting into a 30-year commitment with Chase Mortgage than with him. Still, we stayed together, in no small part because at one point he told me accusingly, ""I know exactly what's going to happen—we're going to move and then you're going to dump me.""So of course I couldn't, even though the relationship had clearly run its course and neither of us was happy. We made it almost a year after moving, at which point he had the good sense to leave, but up to that point he had effectively inoculated the dynamic between us; he had thrown down, and for me to confirm his prediction would have been dishonorable in the extreme.Christopher Hacker's debut novel, The Morels, feels a bit like that kind of a throw down. It's a book that dares you not to like it—it is, in essence, a powerfully alienating story about the power of a story to alienate, a tale about the ways art can redeem and destroy, the pernicious probing of authorial intent, the fragility of families, and damage done that can't be undone—or can it? It wants to ask the big questions, but it wants to make you uncomfortable in the process. Whether the purpose is to force a more honest reaction from an off-balance reader, or simply to pre-empt easy judgment, is hard to say.Consider, for instance, the narrator. A featureless 30ish guy who lives with his mother and works in a movie theater, he is passive to the point of remaining nameless all the way through. While he's working on a film with his old college roommate, he doesn't seem to be any kind of budding auteur, biding his time in the service business in Tarantinoesque dues-paying—he's just a slacker to whom things happen, there to move the action along and, for purposes of the story, eventually run into a childhood friend, Arthur Morel.Morel was a mysterious teenager, prone to pronouncements of the worthlessness of art as a radical statement, and who had gotten himself kicked out of their prestigious music seminary (think: act of art as a radical statement). When their paths cross 14 years later, Arthur is a writer and adjunct professor, on the verge of publishing his second novel. He's also a husband and a father, and he draws our narrator into the circle of his family—lovely wife Penelope, precocious 11-year-old son Will—in the weeks just before his family, and his life, implode. The catalyst, in this case, is the novel. It tells a story about a family called the Morels: Arthur, Penelope, and Will; a mild domestic drama that mirrors their own lives, and then culminates in a disturbingly transgressive sexual act.It's a work of fiction, Arthur explains, even as his father-in-law sues him, his wife takes his son and leaves, he loses his job, and is arrested and put on trial. It's a made up story, he insists as the situation snowballs. Our hapless narrator and his film crew eagerly trade in their second-rate Hamlet adaptation for a documentary about Arthur, shining a literal spotlight on his parents and intensely dysfunctional childhood. But the more they find out, the less we know; the truth only serves to obscure the facts here. Is Morel a true artist willing to lose everything to make a statement? Is he a shameless self-promoter? Is he a hopelessly damaged adult child of abuse and neglect? Is he inventing, or remembering or something else?As The Morels sets up some weighty questions, the reader will find some gnawing metafictional issues to wrestle with as well: Do the characters' lack of depth actually give them rhetorical strength? Is our inability to like any of them our fault, as readers, for requiring relatability rather than real-world homeliness? Does the narrator's lack of any defining personality turn out to serve a different purpose in the story altogether? Are we supposed to like this book? Hacker makes sure, by the end of the novel, that the reader doesn't even have the comfort of falling back on the shallow conventions of taste.Any story about art and morals with a protagonist called Art Morel isn't going to make an initial claim to subtlety (there's also a character who cries a lot named Delores, and young Will, who sets events spinning by sheer... you get the picture). But there are layers that surprise, some vivid writing, and Hacker offers up odd moments that are, for all the book's intellectual exercise, like little jabs to the gut:An officer who could have been one of Arthur's students took down his name on a pad and asked him some question, each one a spoonful of grief.At the same time, it's disconcerting on a purely literary level, changing tenses in a way that might have been designed to mimic a camera pulling out for a wide shot and then back in, but that felt more like grit on the lens. Penelope's infatuation with Arthur the Artist is hard to take as well; he offers her a chance to read the manuscript before its publication and veto the whole enterprise, and she declines out of some servility to creative mystery that doesn't quite come off:Wasn't it refreshing, after years of seeing everything Arthur wasn't, of having pointed out to her everything Arthur could never be—and the kind of family she could never have—to be shown what her husband actually was? ""So no, I don't want to go back to an Art who doesn't make art. I'd rather he offend my parents, offend me.""But something about the whole package kept turning my reactions back on myself: I'm sorry, can you not handle unpleasant characters? Is the story too ugly for you? Is it making you think too hard? I'm sure there are some Anne Tyler novels on the shelf over there—those are nice. There's something passive-aggressive about the book's stance, and at the same time accomplished; you have to admire the ways it toys with you, even if you have reservations about how you're being treated. The Morels knows you want to break up with it, but has no intention of letting you off the hook that easily....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Apr 02, 2013","Apr 27, 2013","Apr 02, 2013",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/13642401-the-morels

So as far as that goes, I don't have much comment on the plot -- it was what it was, and I think it works a lot better framed as a fable than, say a cautionary tale or fantasy -- but I did like the writing quite a bit.

This touches on some great periods in NY history: the creation of the first police force, the first great waves of Irish emigration during the potato famine and the political/religious repercussions, and the role of marginal children in 1845 society. While the tale hinges on the murders of child prostitutes, Faye has a respectfully light touch when it comes to not sensationalizing that particular aspect in any lurid or off-putting way, and manages to get the tale told without lingering on gratuitous details -- which is to her credit, since this is not that story.

Although the book is already more than four years old, an eternity in the world of Internet commentary, most of what he has to say is still valid—and because his tone is measured and he avoids gee-whizzing, it's not hard to imagine where he would have gone with his ideas in 2012.Shirky takes off from the concept of Coasian economics, market theory originated by Ronald Coase in 1937 that looked at the contractual costs and benefits of hierarchical organizations and their advantages over the free market. The premise here is that because online communications have lowered the cost of gathering groups of people together—whether in money, effort, time, materials, or manpower—this radically alters all sorts of equations throughout society. He cycles through a series of anecdotal scenarios to make his points, explaining them clearly and relevantly, without jargon; the examples are well-picked and illustrate his ideas without being heavy-handed. And his commentary is open-ended enough that you can sit back afterward and extrapolate on how it bears on the wired world of 2012, what works and fails online, and why.

I enjoyed the window into Kurt Vonnegut's life -- he's always been kind of furniture-like in my reading life, a major gateway to more sophisticated reading when I was in my early teens but not anyone I had a sense of past his books, so that was interesting and enlightening.But I had a very strong sense that I wasn't reading the book that showed up on the shelves in the middle of November. Mine was a galley and really thick with copy editing errors, notably more than just about any pre-pub version of a book I can remember reading. I'm sure there was a push to get it out on time for Vonnegut's birthday, and hence to push the galleys along, but it was like no one had even read page proofs. And while that kind of thing is eminently forgivable, I have to wonder how much line editing was done on the book as well before final publication. It was enormously full of detail -- Shields' research was exhaustive -- to the point where some paring down would have streamlined and helped. And hey, if I can see that, I imagine the good editors at Henry Holt would have picked up on it as well, and I'm not going to feel comfortable quibbling with anything stylistic about the book until I can check out a finish copy. My criticisms aren't huge, really, but they definitely exist as far as the version I read. But as a biography, and as far as the subject matter goes, it's good stuff. What a sad fellow Vonnegut was.

It dovetails really weirdly with what I'm doing for a living right now -- researching the history of an intellectual anti-Communist left Little Magazine -- and I'm so immersed in this time period right now that it was like listening to someone talk smack about your family when they didn't think you were listening, if that makes sense.Slesinger nails the whole Zeitgeist, the pompousness and uber-seriousness of people who identify as intelligentsia and revolutionaries, building them up and taking them down neatly. The style is a bit dated in that Modernist way, but there's not much you can argue with there.

This was entertaining and invigorating, although it took me the first hundred pages or so to get into her narrative groove. But very much worth it, and dammit now there are seven more to the series and, I find out, two companion books so you can look up the historical references. I'm hoping they have costume pictures, because that's what I was most curious about, and Google only satisfies halfway....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Oct 20, 2010","Nov 12, 2010","Oct 20, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/112078.Niccol_Rising

There was something really lovable about this book, and while I'm not sure it ultimately lived up to the fabulous beginning I enjoyed it all the way through. The whole setting -- New York gangsters in 1963 -- was great, and I loved how Kestin set the noir genre on its ass in a really freewheeling, gum-cracking way. The fact that it was very literary appealed highly. Here you have a self-educated Brooklyn gangster who's extensively well-read, even if he does pronounce Camus ""cay-mus,"" and the young protagonist, a 20-year-old bookworm Brooklyn College student. Great setup, wonderful characters, lots of good dialogue and action.I do think he tried to cram in too much -- while I really like the political slant, and the interweaving of the events of the time, and the thread of weird morality that ran through the mob narrative, it had some truly didactic moments that just broke the spell. And some slightly didactic gratuitous sex that did the same for me -- I'm all for good sex that moves a story along, and most of it did here, but there was some brief Penthouse Forum-worthy action that kind of broke the spell.I think shorter and snappier would have worked better altogether, but it was a fun ride nonetheless.

For me at least, Under the Small Lights was immediately personal, and as well-written as the novel was it didn't have to stretch far to give me a vivid flash of what it was like to be 20, how it wasn't about whether you could get laid--anyone could get laid then whether you knew it or not, because everyone was beautiful--but rather all about being in love: with your lovers and your friends and your emerging self, with all this great literature that you were reading but maybe a bit too young to really get, with all the wonderful forms of medication in the world, and with the sheer possibilities that you weren't always attentive enough to turn into reality.That was my experience of being 20, anyway, and John Cotter nails it with his cast of slightly aimless, self-involved, but basically decent kids. He takes them from winter through summer with a series of small transformations packed densely as a dwarf star; nothing happens and then everything happens. The action is hazy with drugs, gin and peach fuzz, the dialogue stutteringly realistic, and you come away with the sense of having been witness to a sharp sliver of life that they'll always hold at arm's length.That was a year I remember as being uncomfortably fraught with longing and excitement in equal parts, and the characters, while not always lovable, are in love with all sorts of things--including but not limited to each other. The book left me feeling a little stoned and wistful, in a good way. Like the moneyed New England beach town where much of the action takes place, 20 is a fine place to visit and a good place not to have to live for too long. Cotter writes with compassion and generosity, and their story rings true....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jun 24, 2010","Jun 30, 2010","Jun 24, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8189457-under-the-small-lights

Made me think of Chekhov a bit, those slightly fraught, flawed characters and the way your sympathy for them sneaks up on you. Cassandra is a lovely character. Well, they all are, even if Judith is a bit bland -- but she's supposed to be, so it's OK. And you end up sympathizing with her for just having had to grow up in the shadow of her sister's wacky brilliance.The Aristophanes connection is accurate, but it's also kind of simplistic -- the book is about a lot more than just the rending of the one from the one true love. There's a whole lot about family -- how it gets pulled apart, the traps parents set for their children (that whole ""we don't need other people"" ethos they grew up with), young people trying to pull away and find their own identities in the face of such an overbearing family unit.

Maybe because it was a particularly sleep-deprived weird week, and there are certainly the aforementioned dreaded dream sequences (which I liked) bordering on magic realism (which I thought worked), but I keep remembering bits and pieces of the narrative the way you'd remember something you dreamed a few nights ago.

The story of one William Stoner, son of a hardscrabble central Missouri farming couple, follows a gentle and cerebral arc: He enrolls at the University of Missouri to study agriculture but loses his heart to literature, pursues his studies and becomes a teacher there, marries and has a daughter, finds love, loses love, is buffeted by academic politics, grows older, grows ill, and dies. This is not the stuff of suspense.And yet there’s a powerful question that drives the novel, keeping us wondering and never quite resolving until the end: Is the life of the mind enough?

Most of the literary references and all the shrink jokes went over my head. But the sex/feminist stuff hit home as much as it can when you're 13. Not that I related, so much, but it was like having a salty-mouthed drama queen older sister laying all this stuff out for me. And a lot of the sociology was really instructive. So much was outside my sheltered scope—about being raised a certain kind of assimilated Jew (which I was) and, weirdly, a lot about attitudes coming out of WWII. It was written only 30 years after, and there was so much emotion right there on the surface.

I said earlier how I was enjoying it purely as a reader and noStayed up half the night finishing it and… I really can’t be objective about this book. I said earlier how I was enjoying it purely as a reader and not a critic, but it goes deeper than that. It’s like Wroblewski had some kind of infrared Jungian checklist and somehow managed to find out all my childhood fantasies: benevolent and wise dog companion/nursemaid? Check. Super-intelligent semi-wild pack of devoted dogs that sleep with you at night? Check. I guess the only thing worse than being raised by wolves is wishing you were – as a kid I always had a fantasy of a wolf pack appearing on my street to take me away. I wanted a dog who would look out for me like Lassie. So this was like – pardon the crudeness of the simile – finding the porn that gets you off just right.Even though there were problems – a series of transitions in the last quarter of the book that didn’t work well, and the last part in the barn wasn’t the climax or catharsis that I think the book wanted, and yeah, it was fat as a tick on a dog’s ear. But that didn’t matter much to me, honestly – I was so emotionally involved with the characters it was like being in love, in the way logic just flies out the window for a while. And it’s been such a long time since a book did that to me. I gave in, I did, I swooned.Plus there’s a lot that was just right. His language is nicely suited to the tale, elegant and tuned into the natural world. Obviously I’m a dog person so I’m slanted that way in the first place, but I thought he wrote the dogs well. It’s always a treat to read someone who’s so carefully observed something that you have too. And much of the book flowed beautifully. But mostly it was the characters that moved me, people and dogs alike. Not necessarily their inner lives or motivations, which fluctuated all over the board in terms of plausibility – just the fact of them. They’ll stay with me a while. Lord, I cried so hard over Almondine I had to go sit outside for a few minutes with my arm around my own flesh-and-blood dog.And the very last scene just called up my inner 8-year-old and made her happy. I couldn’t evaluate that dispassionately if I tried.In the end I don’t really know what to say about this book that anyone else might relate to. All I know is it transported me, and it was a good ride. ...more",Notes are private!,0,85,1,not set,not set,"Aug 28, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2731276-the-story-of-edgar-sawtelle

I have to go back and look at parts of it, just to open up the watch-case, as it were -- he does so much in terms of evoking images, sensations, and people, without being all describe-y, and I want to see if I can figure how he does some of it. It's very, very careful writing, which I really appreciate. I'm definitely checking out anything else of his that comes my way....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jul 11, 2008","Jul 09, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2176735.Breath

But she really did capture the tone of the time – not quite the entire zeitgeist, but a kind of two-dimensional melange of conversations and cultural artifacts and these stage setlike places that end up coming together in this very oddly evocative portrait of what I think of as my parents’ and siblings’ generation. It reminded me a bit of Mary McCarthy’s The Group, if the women had all moved to the West Coast and become totally disillusioned – I don’t think Wolff has the degree of control McCarthy does, but she does understatement well. Maybe a little too well in places, but she makes her point. And the end is really dark in a rewarding way, which keeps the book from falling completely into trite social novel territory. It definitely dabbles there... but it was fun in a kind of confectionery way. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Jun 19, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/497015.Sudden_Rain

The hardest part for me to get around was his trying to cram too much stuff in there, pushing his fascination with his characters before the reader has a chance to develop their own. When he pulls back, holds onto information and goes for a little less-is-more, it's usually really effective. So I guess my beef would be with the lack of variety where his pacing is concerned -- I think that could push it over into being a great book. On the other hand, he sustains his pitch through the whole novel, and that's something. It's ambitious, and it's very earnest, and I like that he didn't succumb to the temptation to write edgy just because his subject matter is.I really hate the designation of ""freshman novel"" -- it's so condescending -- but in this case I don't think it's such a bad thing.
