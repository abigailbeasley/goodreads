One of the writer's nieces loses her legs and a hand, her sister, her only carer, cannot cope and ends up in an Egyptian mental hospital.

His family are used to exile, having been forcibly removed from Jaffa in 1948 (before he was born) and have suffered earlier invasions (eg 2014), but this one is the longest, the worst so far (at the time of publication 15,000 dead, now double that).
