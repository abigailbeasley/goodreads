I only give it a 3.5/5 stars, although I can see how others could think it was exceptional. It was very descriptive and the character development was very strong - although, at some times McCann's descriptions were a little too drawn out for my taste. McCann does succeed at getting you deep into the minds of the various characters. Which is a feat, given how varied they all are - several prostitutes, recovering drug addict, tight rope walker, priest, etc... However, all the characters are so deeply troubled that it makes for a somber read. It does give you a sense of what New York was like in the 70s. And it is impressive how McCann weaves together the lives of all these characters.I will say that after I finished, when reflecting on the story, it was fascinating to be able to view the same plot from within the heads of all these different, interrelated people. I guess in the end, it was an impressive feat of writing. I just didn't love the characters, so it was hard to love the book. But the point wasn't to make them lovable, it was to make them real. And he succeeded in conveying them as real and their lives as very hard.

Isaacson chronicles Einstein's lifeA great book and a close look at the life and perspective of one of the most brilliant thinkers in recent history. Isaacson chronicles Einstein's life, from his youth, to his early days in the patent office, to his shortcomings as a husband and father, to his great scientific theories, to his world views as a staunch pacifist, then how his views changed in light of WWII, as a zionist, and, and finally, how he spent the better part of his later years chasing a ""unified field theory"" that never came to fruition.It starts early with a note Einstein writes to a colleague:“I promise you four papers,"" the young patent examiner wrote his friend. The letter would turn out to bear some of the most significant tidings in the history of science, but its momentous nature was masked by an impish tone that was typical of its author.It's amazing to think that any one person can come up with theories based largely on personal thought experiments that are so counter to the current collective worldview. And to have those theories empirically proven out in a way that fundamentally shifts people's view of the universe, and how space and time interact- is incredible. [Einstein's] conviction that the universe loves simplification and beauty, and his willingness to be guided by this conviction, even if it meant destroying the foundations of Newtonian physics, led him, with a clarity of thought that others could not match, to his new description of space and time.A highlight was when Einstein's theories were proven valid when he correctly predicted the degree to which the moon's gravity would alter the curvature of light coming from the sun during a solar eclipse. He wrote out his hypothesis on paper, and then it was validated someone else measuring the curvature of light during an eclipse through a telescope !Isaacson is also impressive in the way in which he conveys the science and theories themselves. Reading this was as much a look into Einstein's life, as it was was another chance to try to walk away with a deeper understanding of his physics. Lots of of interesting stuff about people in elevators accelerating upwards, looking at clocks in gravitational fields and on trains traveling at the speed of light, the nature of the atom, and of course e = mc^2.Another interesting quote, related to e=mc^2..A young man tracked [Einstein] ... and insisted on showing him a manuscript. On the basis of his E=mc^2 equation, the man insisted, it would be possible “to use the energy contained within the atom for the production of frightening explosives.” Einstein brushed away the discussion, calling the concept foolish.Of course, later, it talks about the degree to which Einstein and colleagues contributed to the making of the bomb during WWII. (He wasn't as directly involved as he would have liked, because the US government refused to give him security clearance because some concerns about possible connections.) And his guilt later in life:""Perhaps I can be forgiven,” Einstein said a few months before his death ... “because we all felt that there was a high probability that the Germans were working on this problem and they might succeed and use the atomic bomb...And while Einstein will always be known for his scientific theories, and the impact he made on our view of space, time, and the universe- equally fascinating was his later contribution to society, his prescient calls for a an international governing body to resolve conflicts, and his general anti-authoritarian commitment to intellectual freedom.""If we want to resist the powers that threaten to suppress intellectual and individual freedom, we must be clear what is at stake,” he said. “Without such freedom there would have been no Shakespeare, no Goethe, no Newton, no Faraday, no Pasteur, no Lister.” Freedom was a foundation for creativity.These were some of the highlights.

Picked it up because (a) felt like it's a classic I should read at some point, (b) never hurts to reflect on an occasional book on self-improvement, and (c) I got it for under $3 on a Goodreads Deal :).Downside is some of the writing felt dated (to be expected- first published in 1989.) Also felt like would have been nice if it had been somewhat data driven. Have to love books that make points supported only by personal anecdotes about situations with anonymous people. With that said, there's some solid practical advice in here. Things like importance of building an internal set of principles to live by, the power of being a good listener, the need to focus on the non-urgent important things, and how you can get better outcomes and broaden possibilities by approaching situations with a win/win mentality. Also good reminders in how making long-term investments now- in things like relationships, personal health, etc- pay significant dividends.So while there were aspects of the writing which I could have skimmed, and did (which means I cheated a bit, because to really live the 7 habits, according to Covey, you need to study them all carefully), there was a lot of good advice here.

But of course that's the way it should be. Or at least what I should have expected.I'll admit, I started it with all but a vague interest. Popped up in my newsfeed, I had a very superficial interest- along the lines of, ""it's been a while since I read a good war book."" When I started the first chapter, my immediate reaction was, wow - this is way too real. Not sure I want to read this now. Then I realized, of course it's intense, it's a war book. And if marines lived it, the least I can do is read it.So I read it, and every story in this book makes you think. The characters feel very real. The brutality and senselessness of war is palpable. And it takes you deep into the psychology of young soldiers - what is it like to live every day, completely removed from your previous reality, wondering if you'll make it to the next? And then, what's it like, afterwards, to try to revert back to your life before- even though it will never be the same?No matter where one falls on the political spectrum, this is one book that's hard to read without leaving the reader with a deep appreciation for the cruelty of war and the mental and physical sacrifices our troops make to protect us.

At its core is the well worn, root for the underdog storyline. But this time the protagonists are 4 underprivileged, Hispanic high-schoolers who beyond all odds, form a robotics team, enter a national marine-robotics competition, scrape together a small budget, put together their ROV (remote operated vehicle) with a bunch of spare parts, and ultimately go head-to-head with some of the best collegiate engineering teams in the country, including M.I.T.But aside from the heartfelt triumph, what made this story great was:* While the competition is the main theme of the book, the ups and downs of the contest ultimately seem trivial compared to the constant battle the high-schoolers face with poverty, home instability, and in some cases, fear of deportation* The author spends a lot of time helping really understand where the characters come from, their family history, and what they deal with even to show up to school, much less learn and compete in robotics* The competition isn't the end point. The real power of this book isn't just showing the power of a few to overcome, it's the focus on what becomes of the high schoolers after the competitionIt's an easy read and it delivers the expected underdog victory punch. But more importantly, it makes you think deeply about policy in the US, failures in our current system, and how we fail to develop what could be a great source of talent for our country....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Feb 05, 2015","Feb 11, 2015","Jan 10, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/20518979-spare-parts

The product in this case is animated film: Pixar has an amazing track record of delighting their audiences. But many of the lessons can be applied to product creation generally. Concepts that really stood out-- take the time to deeply understand your customers. For Pixar, this could be sending animation teams on location internationally, so the films they created would capture the essence of their subject- trusting the process. your first inspiration is rarely correct, and coming up with something great is an unknown, winding path. at times you will feel lost or want to abandon altogether, but you need to trust the invention process, the feedback from your customers, and the candid input from your peers. With an open mind and a willingness to revisit your assumptions you will arrive at solution that meets your customers needs- don't feed the beast - there is always pressure to deliver. in this case it was film production. in the world of software development, it can be sprint planning or backlogs. It is important is to get to market quickly, and in software, you can do this in a way that tests assumptions. However, a true product or design leader also needs to slow things down when need be. Don't rush to rush. Make sure what you deliver is high quality and delights customers- be willing to fail - if you don't make mistakes, you aren't pushing yourself hard enough to truly invent on behalf of your customers- be candid, but criticize ideas, not people - you need to be honest with your feedback. if something isn't working for customers, you need to be open with your observations. that said, it's important to foster a culture where people separate ideas from the people with the ideas, and realize that getting feedback on ideas ultimately creates a better experienceIn addition to the great product advice, the story about Pixar's creation, Steve Jobs involvement, their track record of award-winning films, and becoming part of Disney was fascinating. But the overall summary of their creation process was the real takeaway.This  is overdue- when I originally read this in 2015, I gave it 4 stars. Since then I've referenced this so many times, I recently upgraded it to 5 stars. Worth a read for anyone trying to lead through ambiguity and create products that delight....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Nov 21, 2014","Feb 05, 2015","Nov 21, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18077903-creativity-inc

Man stranded on Mars and how he attempts to survive, and uses his knowledge of science to conquer the hurdles the red planet and I enjoyed this book. Man stranded on Mars and how he attempts to survive, and uses his knowledge of science to conquer the hurdles the red planet and his limited equipment throw at him every day (or in Mars parlance, every sol). Fast read & immersive. Castaway + Apollo 13 + Macgyver. I found it an entertaining story about the human instinct for survival and ingenuity. Would definitely recommend to a friend.With that said, my big gripe is that while this was a fun book, it could have been a great book if Weir invested more in character development. Supporting characters were totally flat. Watney himself showed shockingly little emotion for a man stranded by himself on Mars. While it was interesting to watch him logically think through every problem thrown at him (although sometimes this got a little repetitious), sometimes you just would have expected him to break down weeping, fight some sort of depression, or include some sort of internal battle between desperation and hope in his daily log entries. If you were stranded on Mars and writing a journal (okay, a lot of suspension of disbelief already), there might be some passages about feeling small, what is human existence, what is life? Possibly some fear? What if he wasn't really alone?? No internal questioning of his crew mates decision to abandon him? Maybe an occasional description of an awe-inspiring panorama of Mars? Best we got was a bunch of ""oh shit"" moments, logical dissection of the next problem, and moving on. He'd often diffuse a stressful situation with humor - although the extent of that humor was often no deeper than the equivalent of a yo-mama/fart joke to his counterparts at NASA. Feels like there just could have been more, and that would have been a great book.Again, all in all, I enjoyed it. Gets 4 stars for the fun read it was. Not 5 stars for the book it could've been. But have to hand it to Weir, very cool premise, awesome grasp of science, and kept me turning pages. And a movie deal. Looking forward to the movie- with some awesome special effects and a little more emotion, it'll be a hit. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jan 14, 2015","Jan 26, 2015","Sep 10, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18007564-the-martian

Would be lying if I said I didn't skim some of it. After a few ""case studies"" around what's wrong with traditional waterfall methodologies, you get the point. I'm guessing these parts were more interesting when the book initially came out and the whole concept of Scrum was a bit more revolutionary. It's been 12 years since the publish date- which is a long time in technology. (For example, they strongly recommend 30 day release cycles- which seems very slow in today's consumer internet world.) A lot of these practices have become much more commonplace since this came out- which I guess is a credit to the authors. But it might be nice if they came out with an updated version.With all that said- a lot of good concepts and refreshers in here.

Creepy.Darker than the type of book I typically pick up - I read on account of the GR book club. The writing style is incredibly detailed and real - but the character development is what sets the book apart. The book is Truman Capote's journalistic account of a real 1959 quadruple murder of a Kansas farmer and his family. It retells the accounts of the victims, their neighbors, the investigators, and the murderers. He spends an extraordinary amount of time digging into they psyches of all the people involved.What's creepy about the book is the extent to which you become familiar with the backgrounds, histories, relationships, and motivations of the perpetrators. His descriptions are so real that you start to feel as if you know them. Any book that brings you that close to the minds and thought processes of cold blooded killers is bound to make you think.Have to give it 5-stars.

At some points it felt like I was reading a movie, so easy to see why they made it into one. ProbaEntertaining book - goes fast and hard to put down. At some points it felt like I was reading a movie, so easy to see why they made it into one. Probably could have developed the Panem backstory a little bit more (maybe that comes in the next books?) But I enjoyed the depth the author put into the character relationships and some of the plot twists- although some of the major shifts weren’t entirely unpredictable. (view spoiler)[Things I particularly enjoyed: the character development and the ways tributes struggled with relationships in games while they knew there could only be a single victor. I also enjoyed some of the clever ways the main characters survived using cunning and skills to outsmart and outmaneuver competitors. Things that annoyed me: The sponsor and gamemaker interference in the games bothered me. It was much more interesting for the characters use their own smarts and abilities to outmaneuver their competitors. Things like fireballs out of nowhere seemed arbitrary. The sponsor gifts from the sky with magical healing medicines seemed like copouts for smarter storylines. I also think it would have been much more interesting for Katniss and Peeta form a more emotionally complex alliance in the games while thinking there could only be one victor. Instead, I thought the unrealistic ""rule change"" made it a lot simpler for the author to let them ally and evolve their relationship. Instead I would have liked for the alliance to form based on a sense of mutual defiance and deeper sense of love/respect for each other.Also, I thought the tribute mutant dogs at the end was just kind of goofy. (hide spoiler)]I want to try book 2. Although, at the end of book 1, I wasn't left entirely wanting more.

Loved the references to Berkeley, the hacker chase, but most interestingly, it takes you back to an earlier time in computI really enjoyed this book. Loved the references to Berkeley, the hacker chase, but most interestingly, it takes you back to an earlier time in computing (in 1989)- which I thought was a fascinating reminder of what things were like. For example, I love the explanation of 'electronic mail.' At this point, I think most people have forgotten what the 'e' in email stands for. Also, a favorite passage, as he explains what the ""Internet"" is: ""At first, DARPA's network [the Internet] was simply a testbed to prove computers could be linked together. Since it was seen as an unreliable experiment, universities and laboratories used it, and main stream military people ignored it. After eight years, only a few hundred computers were connected into the Arpanet, but gradually, others were attracted by the network's reliability and simplicity. By 1985 the network directory listed tens of thousands of computers; today, there must be over one hundred thousand.""100,000 computers! Just for comparison, I did a quick search. Analysts predict there to be more mobile devices connected to the Internet then humans alive in 2016 - that's more than 7.6 billion mobile devices - that doesn't include desktop and laptop computers. (source: Cisco VNI Index). Wonder what it will be like in another 20 years?The story is also fascinating. Shows how one guy in a computer lab in Berkeley was able to track down a ring of international hackers and awaken some of the US top security agencies to the dawn of a new form of espionage. It was amazing how lax computer security was before this - and how it took an incident like this to awaken these agencies to the threat of cyber espionage.Only reason it gets 4 instead of 5 starts is that while the beginning and end are very interesting, about mid-book it starts to get pretty repetitive. E.g. (view spoiler)[Beginning is fascinating as to how he identifies and starts to track the hacker. But there are a hundred or so pages where he just (a) gets alerted that the hacker is active, (b) jumps out of bed, (c) starts a phone trace, (d) the phone trace fails for some reason, (e) he calls a bunch of federal agents and gets ignored. Sequence is interesting a couple times -but got a little repetitive. Could have shortened this part, and spent more time on the actual ring of hackers once they got discovered. This only occupied a small part of the end of the book. (hide spoiler)]Overall, really liked it. I think you need to be a bit of a computer geek to enjoy this one. But would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to reminisce a bit who enjoys a good spy chase laden with UNIX commands....more",Notes are private!,0,43,1,"Aug 23, 2012",not set,"May 20, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18154.The_Cuckoo_s_Egg

Steve Jobs will be remembered as one of the great innovators of our time - this book is a surprisingly honest look into his life, motivations, strengths, and flaws. As a product person, it's an encouraging reminder of the importance of zeroing in on the truly important things that will delight your customers and relentlessly pursuing greatness in those areas. Steve's ability to focus and his obsessive perfectionism was hard to deal with for many - but it's difficult to argue with his streak of market changing successes - Macintosh, Pixar, iPod, iPhone, iPad, iTunes…Another enjoyable aspect of this book was reliving the last 25 years of digital history with an ""insiders"" view of some of the motivations and interactions that drove the industry. From the early days with Xerox PARC, later his interactions with Bill Gates and Microsoft, and more recently Apple's complicated relationship with Google, the cell phone carriers, and the publishers- in his interviews, Steve is very honest about his thoughts on different industry players. All very interesting to read.I really enjoyed it, so I'm giving it 5 stars.
