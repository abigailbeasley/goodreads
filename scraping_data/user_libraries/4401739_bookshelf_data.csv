I downloaded this audio when it became available from my library as I was immediately drawn to the title. I wanted to like it. If you enjoy listening to books with whiney middle school kids - think of the 80's Full house on steriods with friendly aliens - then you will like this book. If you read it, it might be better as you probably won't read as much whine into the kids voices. That said, it took me way longer to listen to this book than it should have as after one too many whiney ""BBBUUUTTT DAAADDD exclaimations from one of the kids, I would shut off the audio and listen to a knitting podcast. For some reason, I was compelled to pick the book back up after a few days just to figure out what was going to happen and then after the 30th BBBUUUTTT DAAADDD, I had to stop again. I am also a little peeved that the story line was very compelling in the beginning yet fell so flat in the end. I connected with several of the characters and wanted to see where they were going and how the story would come together, but the connections just fizzled out in the end and left me dissatisfied that I waisted time reading it to the the end. So, 3 stars for the story but 1 for the whiney kids.

Run, don't walk, to get your copy of this book. It is the best friendship/WWII historical fiction novel I have read. It is definitely a ""clutchable"" book - my 5 star books that at the end you just want to hug to your chest. I will be re-reading this one again in the future. I may also purchase a hard copy so I can hug it to my chest instead of just my cell phone as I listened to this on Audible.I normally only read one or two ""war"" fiction stories a year as they can grow tedious if I read too many too close together. This fabulous story is set during WWII but it is more than WWII fiction. It is a story of friendship and a love story written by a son for his mother. I am not sure what I loved the most about this book.Urrea, in his forward does mention he is writing the book based on the stories his mother told while he was growing up. The fact that a male writing from a female perspective was not lost here. There are many moments, mostly funny guy humor, in the book that as a female, I can imagine happening but that a female would not want to admit. The historical fiction side of the book is almost unbelievable. I will not spoil this portion of the book as it unfolds at the end and in the authors note at the conclusion. Make sure you read the authors note as it is just as important to the story as the entire novel. Urrea conveys the terror of war and there are several parts of the book written with well paced suspense where you can't tear yourself from the story even though you arrived at your destination and need to leave the car. (Again, I listened to this one.)The ""love"" story is multifaceted. The friendship between Irene and Dot, the love between Irene and Handyman, and the love of a son for his mother are all evident. The characters were drawn so well. Even several of the supporting cast will be etched in my memory.Again, stop what you are doing and go read this book! ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jul 18, 2023","Jul 24, 2023","Jul 06, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/63023640-good-night-irene
