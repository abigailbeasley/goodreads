It isn't supposed to be a mystery or a thriller. While there are certainly shocking details that Shriver withholds until the very end, I would say this novel isn't really plot-driven at all; rather, it's a harrowing, heart-wrenching story of what happens when a familial love that should come naturally fails. It explores a nearly unbelievable resilience in our protagonist, Eva, and every nook and cranny in her life that has turned her into an incredibly flawed and equally remarkable narrator. This novel studies the clash between illusion and paranoia; between aggravating optimism and frightening actuality. Through Eva's stunning epistolary prose, we become paranoid, disillusioned, frustrated, infuriated, terrified, cheated, heartbroken, and even, at times, hopeful. This is a depressing and fantastically written novel.

The story follows a recently deceased 11-year-old Willie Lincoln (This novel will go down as one of my favorites, not only by Saunders but by anyone. The story follows a recently deceased 11-year-old Willie Lincoln (Abraham Lincoln’s son) in the Bardo (the equivalent of purgatory in Tibetan Buddhism) as he struggles to move on from his earthly life and accept his own death. Saunders seamlessly weaves together fragments of countless characters’ points of view to tell the story, including historically accurate primary accounts of Abraham mourning his son. A unique and exquisite combination of historical fiction and fantasy, Saunders explores the raw elements that make us human—love, grief, and the inability to let go. While some may be turned off by the unusual style (think more a combination of a play and a research paper), I think this is all the more reason this book is phenomenal—there is simply nothing quite like it in bookstores. Plus, as Saunders says himself, nothing ever worth doing has gone without criticism. I will say that the reader may have to grapple with some confusion at the beginning of the novel. Its idiosyncratic form initially requires an adjustment (hence, the temporary confusion) but I assure you it quickly becomes easy to follow. Any Abraham Lincoln aficionados, anyone who is currently or has ever grieved, and/or anyone curious about Buddhist afterlife beliefs should read Lincoln in the Bardo. Beyond this, this novel is for anyone willing to trust the atypical; trust that the confusion will suddenly become clear, that bizarre aspects will become vital to the story, and that it will culminate in a moving and important message (which it does!). Lincoln in the Bardo dares to be abnormal in both form and content, making it a riveting and memorable read. I cannot endorse enough. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Feb 22, 2017","Mar 05, 2017","Feb 22, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29906980-lincoln-in-the-bardo

I did have to read this 450-page book in less than a week for a seminar on the history of doctoring in the United States, which may have contributed to my lack of enthusiasm for it. This is a dense book that outlines Martin Arrowsmith's work as a medical practitioner in the early 20th century in excruciating detail (although I wasn't sure what I was expecting; I did have to read this for a medical history class). The plot is fairly slow and revolves almost exclusively around Arrowsmith's switching from job to job, its climax late in the novel and, dare I say, fairly anti-climactic. If pre-modern medicine fascinates you, then perhaps you will enjoy this novel. If you're more into fictional stories and less interested in blander historical accounts (like me), perhaps less so. I did think Lewis characterized the few women in the novel very well, which was progressive for the early 1900s. The subtleties and complexities in Leora and Madeline helped characterize them as interesting and real people, breaking them free from the gender stereotypes of the agreeable, personality-less housewife. There was also a bit of humor in this novel, most clearly seen in Arrowsmith's utter lack of interpersonal skills and his inability to interact with humans at all. I can see how this book would be an interesting read for the right audience (the medical history buff, ideally), which, I can now say, I am not....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Feb 20, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11389.Arrowsmith
