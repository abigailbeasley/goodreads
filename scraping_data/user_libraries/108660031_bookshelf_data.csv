I'd put the reading experience in the same bracket as Nicholson Baker's The Mezzanine, in that at times it was completely beautiful, but if I was even slightly tired I kinda wanted to die. I have so much respect for how much time this must have taken to write, how much thought went into each word selection, paragraph structure, the exact syllabic count of each sentence. The manipulation of the language is perfect at times. When this book Hits you can really just sink into the prose and feel so cosy and at home like you're swimmin around in a cup of tea. You also gotta admire Baume's commitment to FINDING all this domestic detail and bundling it into a novel where, literally, Absolutely Nothing Happens.That kinda saggy middle of the book was definitely where I struggled, for that reason. I started to get a bit frustrated that really nothing, NOthing was going to happen. The descriptions start to feel a tad repetitive. There's not really any tension in the relationship, despite the sense of violence and looming threat in a lot of the imagery. Maybe Baume could have made the same points about The Simple Life in less time. bUt i guess all this I've said is kinda the point. Sometimes 8 years just pass. Sometimes the same things do just happen. Sometimes two people do just love each other. Yeah yeah nah yeah tbf there may not be tension but the slow transition of the couple from being naive young #vanlife people to becoming basically the same person is executed in such a subtle, haunting and tender way.Hmmmm okay okay the more I get into this  the more I think 3.52 is actually too low??

It's a novel with loads of highly ambitious elements that shouldn't work but kinda do, and other more conventional elements that should work pretty easily but feel kinda off. Basically we got a very old lady in like the equivalent of Southend refusing to leave her home, her young n unexpectedly pregnant carer, and THEN her mother way back in colonial India getting pregnant and having a bad time. Also then the old lady in her childhood later on. All in first person. It's a lot. The main hook for me was seeing how Conran was gonna pull it off. And tbf she did a pretty good job of it.I think there are some problems with the writing itself, mostly the dialogue. I felt like the robot devil in futurama going 'you cant just have your characters announce how they feel! That makes me feel angry!' There definitely could have been something quite phenomenal here had the author reigned herself in a little bit and let the stories speak for themselves more.

Li seems to be grappling here with the impossibility of remembering How Things Happened, how something was said, how you felt during the big moments of your life.It's her power of observation and her kinda ghostly, just slightly strange way of presenting people that really draws us into all these lives.

It's four parts, four different lockdown stories written in four different styles, essentially being like 'how about this', 'no actually how about this', 'or this', 'actually forget it'. It's really interesting to see Philip fucking with the ideas in real time. Like, he does a really good job of making everything as boring and banal as possible, then seems to just go 'actually fuck this someone's gotta get stabbed'. Defo a bit wanky in places when he starts writing about the craft of the story during the story - felt like he could have left all that to speak for itself - but I respect the ambition to fuck with the form, and ultimately each story is really rewarding in the way they slowly unfurl and pull threads together. On the whole our Phil uses covid really effectively as a means of exploring how little we know about people's private lives.

This is a tour de force of the nothing-happens genre. They even find a severed head in a suitcase and it drives the plot nowhere. The language! The dialogue! Just completely off the rails! I've read and loved Annie before but she is just so completely On from the get go here. You won't find a single cliche in the whole book, and if there is a familiar scenario to us (folks in the diner arguing about the way things used to be) she comes at it with such flair and such imagination that it cant feel like anything other than real life.

Burning Bright has the emotive characters, it has the stunning one liners, it has flashes of the breathtaking, simple descriptions of setting that we've come to expect from the goat. I guess the attempt to clang together the forms of the play and the novella make the scenes feel a little static. It's not quite one thing or the other. The dialogue isn't quite compelling enough to sustain the whole thing, and the settings aren't quite rich enough to get fully absorbed in.A lot of that comes down to the changes in the setting. So what's happening here is the same plot is carrying on chronologically, but for some reason all the characters keep changing jobs in between. It's like one story told in three parallel universes, one at the circus, one at a farm, one on a boat. And I just dont know... why. Lmao. Is it something to do with the play's concluding message that every kind of person has a responsibility to raise every child? Or was Steinbeck just fuckin about? I respect it. I just dont know what it's adding. Fair play though it was fun. Some pretty wild gymnastics to get to its weirdly moral dismount.

I've never seen so many extremely straightforward and overly-convenient plot resolutions in one book before. But that's just one of my issues with A Man Called Ove. The others are:The plot structure feels so much like watching every mid hollywood film ever, in that the trajectory of the story is so obvious from the start that reading it just feels like going through the motions. As soon as the cat rocks up I'm like '...yep'. Like, yeah it's light, it's cosy, but I'm actively SIGHING every time a by-the-numbers plotbeat is hit. Sometimes a layer of predictability in a story is a good thing but... mate. We are in Skim City.Why do we keep driving to the hospital?Any social issue that's raised feels like cultural boxticking. The style! FUCK! Backman is obsessed with utterly useless similes. I've read the words 'as if' so many times this week I think I now have diahorrea. Hold on let me turn to literally a random page.... 'Ove stares back at it [the cat] with a suspicion normally reserved for a cat that has rung his doorbell with a bible in its paws, like a jehovah's witness'... like.... okay??? I'm not joking there's at least two of these every page and none of them made me laugh. And THAT'S THE THING with this book lads;::;;:: at its core there's actually a really important and meaningful story here about masculinity and loneliness, and a really valuable emotional reshaping of the miserable bastard down the road. Objectively, there are heartwarming moments here. Some stunning chapters that exhibit a real wonderful tenderness. But these moments are just getting smothered by so much BULLSHIT.

Romeo & Juliet type love story set around the troubles in Cyprus in 1974 and the aftermath of it. Stunning and very emotional engagement with the setting, brilliantly researched and brought to life. The significance of food was a winner for me. Definitely always looked forward to opening up the book.The dialogue... is bad. And the chapters told from the fig tree's perspective do feel quite preachy most of the time. And also I feel like it was doing a lot of cultural box-ticking like,,, 'yup we mentioned mental health okay good' BUT the exploration of inherited trauma and the way the fragments of the story come together make for a really compelling and rewarding read on the whole.

Never come across a book so well sustained by its style and narrative voice.Getting a character to annotate another character's memoir for two thirds of a novel is... so fascinating. I was sceptical that it could work for that long. But here we are. It's Li's level of observation and just like the chop of her sentences that make it absolutely bang. It's also refreshing to see a book develop characters with so few visuals. It's all voice voice voice here. The trade off is that some of the cast of this big, complicated family are cloudier than others, but the ones who shine we get to know in such a gradual and organic way. It just simmers along so nicely. Hits good emotional moments without knocking itself unbalanced.
