Its screenplay is loosely based on this story, with some significant changes.The narrator Hideo is a Japanese screenwriter in his 40s, recently divorced. He's not on the best of terms with his former wife and their son wants nothing to do with him. In fact he's utterly alone - his parents died in an accident when he was twelve. Even his apartment building seems empty, apart from a lady who knocks on his door one night in search of company. But he's too distracted to give her any attention and sends her away. On a whim the next day, he decides to take a visit to the neighborhood he grew up in. He's shocked to meet a fellow who looks just like his father. The man brings him home for a drink, where Hideo is further astonished to meet his mother. He doesn't know how this can be happening but he basks in the comfort of his long-lost family. There appears to be a price to pay, however - every time Hideo spends time with these people he gets sicker.This is a ghost story with a difference. It's about grief and loneliness - the spirits of Hideo's parents provide him with the love he has been so desperately missing out on all of these years. But this situation can never be truly genuine, and that's what sucks the life out of him. He needs to stop living in the past and make meaningful connections for real. I must admit I preferred the film that is adapted from this work - it's helped by an amazing Andrew Scott performance which gives it the emotional heft that is sometimes missing in this book. And I did find the translation a little awkward at times, not something I usually notice.

Instead of telling his story from childhood to fame in the conventional way, Jarvis Cocker (lead singer of Pulp) describes it through the objects he has stored over the years in his attic. It helps that he is a major hoarder, and averse to change - among the treasure he finds the packaging of a favourite soap, a dirty jokebook he once discovered on a schoolbus, even carrier bags that have caught his eye over the years.These items help Cocker jog his memory of growing up in Sheffield before his music career took off. He still has the loud polyester shirts purloined from jumble sales which informed his sense of fashion as a teenager. Old notebooks are included, where he imagined the manifesto for the band he was about to create. He posts the s of their first gigs and photos of fresh-faced, yet moody-looking group members.If you're looking for the real story of how Pulp became one of Britain's most popular bands, this is not the book for you.

Early on we discover that he's a serial killer - he follows young women late at night before strangling them. He doesn't seem to have any friends but on a whim he looks up an old army buddy named Brub Nicolai. Brub invites him to dinner with his wife Sylvia and they get talking about old times. Then Dix registers his mistake - Brub is now a detective and has been assigned to solve the murders he has committed. However, Dix also realises he can use this situation to his advantage. Posing as a crime writer, he asks his friend about the investigation, claiming it as research. This allows him to stay one step ahead of the police, but he cannot control his urges, and it won't be long before the net tightens on him.This book was published in 1947 and was well ahead of its time in the way it addresses misogynism and toxic masculinity. It was adapted into a successful film starring Humphrey Bogart with substantial differences to the novel - the main one being that in the movie Dix is innocent. I must admit that I found it an unsavoury read. Dix is an extremely distasteful individual. I know he's meant to be - he's a serial killer after all. But the time I spent in his angry, twisted brain left me very uncomfortable. I also found the other characters frustrating - Brub is infuriatingly slow at putting the pieces together.

I never thought I'd be reading a book on the subject for fun, but I received this one as a Christmas present, so here we are.From what I gather Carlo Rovelli excels at explaining physics to unscientific minds like my own. In this volume he discusses the idea of white holes, the existence of which is not universally acknowledged. Basically they are the opposite of a black hole and can be found across the event horizon. In the same way matter cannot exit a black hole, it can't enter a white hole from the outside. However, although black holes in space have since been identified and photographed, white holes have not.Rovelli uses quantum mechanics to explain this theory and it gets pretty heavy at times, though he does give the reader permission to skip ahead.

The boys are curious and a little bit mischievous, but most of all they are wondering why their depressed mother doesn't want to be with them any more. Victoria Roubideaux is a pregnant teenager, shunned by her family. She turns to Maggie Jones, a kindly neighbour, for help. Maggie has troubles of her own, caring for a father who has dementia, so she can't host Victoria for long. However, Maggie hits upon an usual solution - she asks the McPherons, a couple of elderly bachelors who live on a farm outside of town, to take Victoria in. They are initially rocked by the request, but come around to the idea and give the girl a place to stay. Broken families are a major theme in this touching tale.

I was a particular fan of Young Skins and his latest book follows that winning formula. It examines the fortunes of those existing on the margins in rural Ireland - small-time criminals who do what they can to make a living and survive. The characters are adrift, searching for meaning, unhappy with their lot. The story captures the hopelessness that can often exist in such communities: a sense of feeling trapped, which makes for a bleak but authentic reading experience.

But on a stay with his grandfather in a remote part of Scotland, things get even stranger - a group of peculiar creatures he never knew existed start racing down a hill towards him. These mythical animals come from a place called the Archipelago, and it turns out his grandfather is the guardian between our world and theirs. A baby griffin is one of those creatures and as Christopher gives it comfort, its frantic owner arrives. She's a girl called Mal with secrets and special abilities of her own. And she's being pursued by a relentless killer. Mal asks Christopher for help and being the brave, responsible lad he is, he naturally agrees. This decision will take him on an incredible journey, full of danger and excitement.The s for Impossible Creatures have been effusive to say the least - The Telegraph hailed it a modern classic, while Rundell is being described as the heir to C.S. Lewis and Philip Pullman. And maybe that's why I was left feeling a little disappointed. I enjoyed the novel but it didn't blow me away in the manner I was led to expect. It is imaginative - I liked how the book begins with a detailed glossary of all the mythical creatures that exist in the Archipelago. And in Christopher and Mal, she has created two characters that are easy to root for - the friendship that develops between them is a beautiful thing. But I must say that I found it a bit too derivative of children's fantasy, and Pullman's work in particular. More than once I thought of the His Dark Materials series while reading this one, and that trilogy felt like it had a lot more depth and nuance to it.

Married with three grown children, he begins a relationship with a handsome young fellow named Frank, an arrangement his spouse grudgingly puts up with. Henry Ellis also has a wife, Edith, though their union is unconsummated. She lives separately with a girlfriend, while he wrestles with a perversion that he is too embarrassed to discuss. The men begin to correspond via letter, and decide to write a book that argues for the freedom to live a homosexual life. Friends and family warn against publishing such a controversial text, though they remain undeterred. That is until Oscar Wilde's imprisonment for gross indecency, which threatens to scupper their brave plans.The New Life is an impressive piece of writing. Crewe captures a fraught and fearful time for gay men, when homosexuality in the UK was not only taboo but illegal. The paranoia and shame that these characters feel is eloquently expressed. While I had sympathy for Addington's situation, I also felt sorry for his poor wife, whose situation was considered secondary to his own urges and desires.

The Romantic examines the fortunes of a very different kind of character, an adventurer by the name of Cashel Greville Ross.Ross is initially raised in Ireland by an aunt, but after some doubts about his parentage the pair move to Oxford. A family dispute prompts him to join the British Army and at age 15 he takes part in the Battle of Waterloo. A serious injury causes him to re-evaluate his purpose in life and he decides to travel the globe in the hopes of making his fortune. A stint in the East Indian Army doesn't work out so well, but he fares better in Italy, becoming friends with Mary Shelley and Lord Byron.

St Joseph's Doora-Barefield, based in County Clare, won the national championship back in 1999. But in 2009 things are looking much bleaker - the club are one of the weaker sides in their own county, and the stars of the '99 triumph are fading fast. The players are also dealing with tragedies that transcend sport, hoping that the distraction and brotherhood of the dressing room will bring them together in pursuit of victory.The story is told by Christy O'Connor, goalkeeper of the team and a fine journalist in his own right. He gives us a fly-on-the-wall view of what goes on behind the scenes in such a club - the endless planning, the arguments, the politics. He's going through personal turmoil himself, trying to cope with the death of his baby daughter. Sport is a release for him, a diversion from grief. One of the things I liked most about this story is that it examines the fortunes of a struggling team. We hear so many tales of success, and it makes a refreshing difference to read about a club that is desperately trying to stay competitive. The sporting side of it is fascinating - the tension between management and the squad, the conversations that take place in the inner sanctum during a game, the motivational texts that players send each other before matches, the simmering resentments that can tip over into a full-blown row. Why do these guys put themselves under so much pressure, you might ask yourself? And it's because the club means everything to them. It's an escape from their day-to-day lives. For many, it gives them a purpose. And the chance to win, to achieve the ultimate prize with a group of people who become as close as family is something worth fighting for. It's a wonderful book - you don't need to be a dedicated fan of hurling or even sport to appreciate the life lessons spilling from its pages....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Dec 19, 2023",Jan 2024,"Dec 19, 2023",,,view (with text),/book/show/9672635-the-club

They vary from a couple escaping a Puritan community, to a widower who becomes obsessed with growing apples, to his twin daughters - one of whom has many suitors, much to the chagrin of the other. And so on up until the present day. Most of these stories end in tragedy, and their spirits haunt the old house, unable to rest.This is one of those books that is a technical marvel. Mason invents so many vibrant characters that are all completely unique, and the style of each tale reflects the time period it is written in. The plot is complimented by historical documents, psychiatric case notes, song lyrics and love letters, all of which make the story feel more authentic. However I have to say that the novel overall left me cold. I couldn't really connect with the people it described - maybe it was down to the fact that the narrative jumped from one to another so often, and the differences between them often felt jarring.

Most children play either Gaelic football, hurling or caWhen you grow up in Ireland, you have an opinion on Gaelic games, whether you like it or not. Most children play either Gaelic football, hurling or camogie at school, and the All-Ireland Finals, contested every year by the best teams in the country, are impossible to ignore. For the record, Ciarán Murphy adores the GAA (Gaelic Athletic Association) unconditionally and unreservedly, and this book is his love letter to the sport.Murphy is a well-known journalist on the Emerald Isle: a regular contributor to the Irish Times and a host of the popular Second Captains podcast. Hailing from the village Milltown in North-East Galway (close to my own neck of the woods - hon Clonberne!), he has been steeped in the GAA from an early age. With his father coaching several Milltown teams over the years and uncle Jim Carney a renowned GAA reporter in his own right, avoiding Gaelic games was never an option. Just as well he loves it so much.It is quite a niche book, this one. There is a lot of precise detail about Galway football - county team, club championship etc, so some prior knowledge of the sport certainly helps. Remembering his schooldays, Murphy talks about his time in St Jarlath's of Tuam, a institution famous for producing the finest Galway footballers. A talented player himself by the sounds of it, he was never quite good enough to make the Galway senior squad, but a valuable member of his local team in Milltown. He lined out there for several years before transferring to Templeogue Synge Street in Dublin.So what makes the GAA so special? Murphy clearly admires the amateur ethos of the sport - your footballing hero on a Sunday could be delivering your post on Monday morning, as in the case of Galway legend Ja Fallon. But it's also the sense of community that grassroots GAA brings: you are born into a parish, you play alongside your friends and neighbours and support that club for the rest of your days. It fosters a bond that can never be broken - the joy of victory and heartache of loss is shared with the people you love most.The book finishes on a strong note. Murphy gives us a diary of his season as a member of a Templeogue Synge Street team and it really gets inside the mindset of a typical GAA player - the ambition, the addiction and the commitment it all takes, no matter what level you are operating at. And then there is a wonderful coda about the life of Sean Brennan, a Milltown player who lost everything but found himself again through Gaelic football. It's a beautiful, life-affirming piece and truly sums up what the GAA is all about. This memoir made me reassess and reappreciate my relationship with Gaelic games.

She has been unlucky in love, marrying young and divorcing soon after. And after developing an unrequited crush on a colleague, she's more than skeptical about her chances of romance. To be honest, she barely has the time, pouring herself into all-nighters at work on a regular basis. One of her sketches is about how nerdy, ordinary-looking guys are often able to date beautiful women, and that the same would never happen if roles were reversed. But then Noah Brewster, a handsome singer and the host of that week's show, asks her to help him with a scene. The chemistry between them is undeniable. However, they lose contact for a couple of years before reconnecting. Surely it's too good to be true, Sally thinks to herself. She's excited and terrified, but has to find out if this will lead anywhere.The book is split into three acts - the first takes place during Sally and Noah's week working on TNO, the second consists of a string of emails to each other and the third occurs when they meet up in person again. I've heard some people complain that the email section went on for too long but I loved this part. It really captures that initial stage in a relationship when you have huge crush on somebody, wondering if they are feeling the same way, afraid of oversharing but thrilled every time you receive a response (reminding me of the Taylor Swift song Delicate). And I admired the way the story portrayed a budding romance in general, not just the good stuff: the second-guessing, the insecurity, and how a simple miscommunication can stop it in its tracks. I was rooting for Sally and Noah the whole way through. Romantic Comedy is a witty and intelligent take on modern relationships - a will-they-won't-they tale that keeps you turning the pages.Favourite Quotes:""When I saw him from behind as I walked toward the stage—he again wore a light T-shirt and black jeans—I felt a stomach-churning, pulse-quickening swooniness that I was so unaccustomed to I almost didn’t recognize it.""""“You know when you’re really vibing with another person?” he said. “Like for once the loneliness lifts, and you fully get each other—do you think that’s all bullshit?” I took a deep breath and said, “I don’t think it’s bullshit.

Now 42, her teenage daughter Jules is the reason she gets up every day, even though their relationship is often fractious. Jules doesn't come home one night and Mary Pat is immediately worried. It's 1974 and the city of Boston is on edge right now, with school desegregation inciting protests and rallies. There's a big drug problem in the neighborhood and Jules has been dating one of the main dealers. So Mary Pat definitely has cause for concern.

She could never imagine that her daughter's disappearance could be linked to his death, but two detectives investigating the case believe so.

She's neurodivergent and prefers to live life to her own particular rhythm. Social situations are difficult for her - in fact she uses an etiquette guide from the 1950s to help navigate such events. Most days Sunday works in a greenhouse, enjoying the solitude and calming atmosphere. Her parents have passed on and her sister Dolores died tragically, so Dolly is her only family, but even she is beginning to tire of her mother's peculiarities. Their world is upended with a new arrival next door. Vita is everything Sunday is not - loud, vivacious and incredibly posh. In spite of their differences, the two women enjoy one another's company. When Vita and her husband Rollo invite Sunday and Dolly over for Friday night dinner, a friendship blossoms. But Dolly begins to spend more and more time with her new friends, and Sunday feels like she has no say in where things are headed.This is a solid debut with a memorable protagonist. I've since learned that the author is also autistic and she gives us a fascinating glimpse of what life is like as a neurodivergent person. It's not hard to feel sympathy for a character who finds everyday interactions so much more difficult to manage than most. Sunday has had to put up with a lot and the layers of her sad history are gradually peeled back - I found the conversations with her ailing mother particularly heartbreaking. I did feel like the pacing of the story was a bit off: the first three-quarters of the book are a slow burn, and then a lot happens towards the end. But maybe that also chimes with Sunday's gentle life being upended so dramatically. It's a fine beginning from Viktoria Lloyd-Barlow - I'm already intrigued to see what she does next.Favourite Quotes:""Sometimes I imagine how it would feel to access the effortless communication that Dolly and Vita enjoy.

They're both grieving the loss of loved ones and a fiery rage burns inside them for the men who tore their lives apart. Then Wendy mentions her favourite movie, Strangers on a Train, and a plan begins to hatch between them: what if they could solve each others' problems and get away scot-free?There are twists galore in this pulsating tale - I'm normally good at figuring them out but they caught me by surprise more than once. And I was about to say this book would make a great movie; however there is one significant plot detail that works much better on page than on screen. I did think the finale was a bit rushed but I had great fun getting there.

It was a more innocent time, before the dawn of the internet - radio, Top of the Pops and magazines like Smash Hits were the main ways teenagers learned about their favourite bands. CD singles sold in vast amounts and reaching the number one position in the weekly charts was still a meaningful and much-coveted achievement.The book begins with the Spice Girls, who changed everything. Their cheeky attitude and catchy tunes made pop music exciting again. They influenced so many new bands around that time - All Saints were seen as edgier version, whereas Five were imagined as a male equivalent. But we also hear from other groups that didn't make quite the same impression - the likes of A1 and Girl Thing. It's fascinating to hear them discuss their reasons for not quite succeeding.It's told in an oral history format, which makes it a pacy and gossipy read. We hear directly from many of the stars and they're not afraid to hold back. The members of Five talk openly about how much they disliked one another. S Club 7 and the Sugababes tell us about their grueling schedule, which didn't stop them partying and turning up to Saturday morning TV shows still drunk from the night before. The Spice Girls talk fondly about the house they all shared before they made it, assigning Victoria bathroom cleaning duty and taking care of Emma who was living away from home for the first time.However, I'm also wondering if the oral history structure holds it back a bit, because the analysis Cragg provides at the start of each chapter is so astute and hilarious.

Writers & Lovers was an enjoyable read - it had characters that came alive and provided a fascinating glimpse into the unglamourous life of a struggling author. So I was interested to see her tackle the short story format.Certain themes echo throughout the collection. Addiction is one, literary ambition (a subject also addressed in her previous novel) is another. Some of the stories resonated with me more than others. The opener, Creature, is narrated by a teenage girl working as an au pair for a wealthy family, who becomes smitten with the dashing uncle of the children she looks after. When In The Dordogne takes place during a transformative summer in the life of a teenage boy, who falls under the charge of two exuberant college sophomores while his parents take a mystery trip to France. My favourite of all was title tale, about a lonely single father who has a secret crush on one the employees at his bookstore.I must say that a few of the stories didn't do anything for me and I did feel like the quality dipped towards the end of the book. I've read praise for the final story in particular, about the frustrations of the writing process, but it was all a bit too meta and I struggled to connect with it. For me, Lily King is at her strongest when she focuses on authentic, real-life situations, and emotions like loneliness and grief, that we've all been accustomed to.

And when I heaAs I've mentioned before on this site, any novel that earns favorable comparisons to The Secret History immediately grabs my attention. And when I heard it was the debut of a writer who hails from my neck of the woods, I knew I needed to check it out.Like Donna Tartt's masterpiece, the story focusses on a tight group of friends and a tragic death. The action takes place in the fictional Irish town of Kinlough (a thinly disguised version of Galway). It opens in 2003, when six teenagers are enjoying a glorious summer. Kala is the most charismatic member of the gang, mysterious, fearless and effortlessly cool. But in November of that year, she disappears without trace, shattering the lives of her close friends. Fifteen years later, three of them meet up again. Mush has never left Kinlough, staying to work in his mother's cafe. He's a shy and sensitive soul, his facial scars giving him further reason to hide away from the world. Joe Brennan on the other hand is now a world famous rock star. On the surface he has everything, yet he's secretly struggling with an alcohol problem and has never truly processed the death of Kala, who was his girlfriend at the time she went missing. Helen lives in Canada, working as an investigative journalist, but she's back in Kinlough for her father's wedding. She has kept her family and friends at a distance in recent years. The trio meet up and reminisce about the good old days. However, their world is rocked when Kala's remains are found on a local construction site and Mush's twin cousins go missing. After all this time, it looks like the truth will finally come out.On the whole, I found this novel engrossing but I'll get a few small criticisms out of the way first. The pacing of the book felt off to me. Too little happened in the first two thirds of the story, and too much happened at the end. At times it felt crammed with red herrings and unnecessary detail. I also guessed the killer early on, but maybe that's because I read too many of these kinds of books. However, there is much to commend about Kala. The characterisation is superb and that's where the comparisons to Tartt are worthy in my opinion. I really felt like I got to know the thoughtful Mush and a stubborn Helen intimately. To me, Joe is the most intriguing of all: a flawed and weak individual hiding underneath a shallow veneer of success. The dialogue is excellent - an emotional argument between Helen and her sister Theresa was the standout scene in the whole book for me. And I thought Walsh nailed the local slang without overdoing it. So despite a few reservations, I can still heartily recommend Kala. It's a compelling story of friendship and grief, with a haunting mystery at its core.

His latest effort follows a similar formula, but focuses on a very different bunch - the macho, testosterone-fuelled action heroes that ruled the box office during the same time period.We get a fascinating glimpse into each of their personalities and a behind the scenes look at the movies that made their name. Schwarzenegger comes across better than most - a driven, hard-working fellow who seemed to have the golden touch when it came to choosing scripts. His great rival Stallone fares worse - undeniably talented, but insecure and in possession of a colossal ego. A good-natured Chuck Norris flew the flag for Team America in all of his films, even if their artistic quality was questionable. Jackie Chan is bestowed with saintly status, a humble individual who broke new ground with his outrageous stunts. Steven Seagal is the biggest joke of all, a narcissist who invented complex backstories for himself in the hopes of appearing mysterious and as it later emerged, treated his co-stars very badly.The book is full of entertaining anecdotes that I had not heard before. For example, Dolph Lundgren (Ivan Drago himself) has an IQ of 160 and had received an MIT scholarship before embarking on his film career. I was intrigued to hear how Die Hard was only Bruce Willis's third movie, and Fox bet the farm on him after a host of other stars had turned down the role of John McClane. And I found out that Stallone was so poor before writing Rocky, he sold his beloved dog Butkus to make some money (and bought him back when he sold the script).I grew up watching these movies, and while not all of them stand up as well today, I will always have a particular fondness for them. De Semlyen's research is meticulous and each chapter is an enjoyable, nostalgic dive back into a simpler time.

Her father is the most powerful man in the village - he runs his own factory, publishes a newspaper and funds the local Catholic Church. She and her older brother Jaja live in luxury compared to many of their fellow Nigerians. But all is not well at home. Papa is what you would call a religious fanatic, beating his family for the smallest transgressions. Jaja has a deformed finger to show for it and their mother has suffered miscarriages due to her husband's abuse. Papa lays out a strict schedule of study and prayer for his children - woe betide them if they don't follow it. However, one day he surprisingly allows them to stay with Aunty Ifeoma, a college professor - their first time away from their parents. Ifeoma's home, humble as it may be, is a revelation - Kambili and Jaja are amazed at the laughter and freedom of discussion that their cousins are encouraged to take part in. Their eyes are opened and finally they begin to question the authority that has made their lives a misery.This is Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's debut and it was shortlisted for the Women's Prize for Fiction back in 2004. It introduces some of the traits that her books have become famous for: Nigerian politics, strong female characters, religion and rebellion. It's easy to feel sympathy for Kambili and her family, living in perpetual fear of her monstrous father. But I did think the story was a bit heavy-handed in this aspect - repetitive in how it emphasized Papa's brutality, without ever really getting under the surface of what made him tick. And similarly, the contrast of Ifeoma's happily unfettered household was exaggerated. Adichie would go on to show more subtlety in later novels like Americanah and Half of a Yellow Sun.

The masterful Small Things Like These was one of the best ed books of 2021. The Quiet Girl, an adaptation of her novel Foster and one of the best films of the last decade in my eyes, has shone an even greater spotlight on the work of this gifted Irish writer.Antarctica is her debut, a collection of stories first published in 1999. It is a little rough around the edges, true, but there are several moments of sheer brilliance - you are left in no doubt that this author has talent to burn.The characters in these unsettling tales are all damaged in some way. Broken marriages, grief, loneliness - these are some of the subjects that have emerged to upend their lives. Most of the stories are set in Ireland, and to be honest the few that take place elsewhere are a bit jarring. Keegan's writing feels much more natural and assured in her native land.A few of the stories stood out in my mind. Men and Women describes the relationship between a domineering farmer and his long-suffering wife through the eyes of their child, leading up to a flashpoint where one of them finally snaps. The Ginger Rogers Sermon is a devastating account of a young girl's crush on a farm hand and the shocking consequences. And Sisters, the book's longest effort, is a wonderfully spun tale of a middle-aged woman who gradually gets the upper hand on her more successful and popular sibling.Like Keegan, I also grew up on a farm in rural Ireland and I can tell you she absolutely nails its problems: the isolation, the silent heartache, the limited routes of escape. But it also made me nostalgic for my childhood in a strange way, a simpler time when life moved at a slower pace. Not all of the stories work - some of them are bit heavy-handed in their symbolism (Ride If You Dare is a prime example).

Did the memory of his victims' faces, and the thought of the suffering of their families, torment his days and haunt his dreams?""First, some context. Back in July 1982, Ireland was rocked by two gruesome murders. Bridie Gargan, a nurse who was sunbathing in Dublin's Phoenix Park, was brutally attacked with a hammer and left bleeding in the backseat of a car as her assailant escaped. She subsequently died of her injuries. A few days later in Edenderry, a farmer named Donal Dunne was selling a gun to a stranger when the prospective buyer turned and shot him in the face with it. The police quickly realised that the killings were linked, and soon got their man - an eccentric member of the upper class named Malcolm Macarthur. And to top it all off, he was found in the apartment of the Attorney General, the chief legal advisor to the Irish Government.The case has been a sensation in this country from day one. But this book is not a simple retelling of the crime and the investigation that followed. Instead, Mark O'Connell inserts himself into the story, describing his own links to the scandal and his relationship with Macarthur, which developed in some unexpected ways throughout the course of the project.O'Connell explains that he was aware of the case from an early age, his grandparents having lived in the apartment building adjacent to the one where Macarthur was found. He later completed a PhD on the work of John Banville, whose novel The Book of Evidence was clearly inspired by Macarthur's misdeeds. O'Connell also describes seeing Macarthur frequently around Dublin's city centre, wanting to speak to him, in the hopes that he might understand his motives and discover if he felt any remorse.So that's what he did. O'Connell walked up to him one day, explained who he was and that he would like to interview him. Macarthur was taken aback, but agreed to an initial chat. And once he started, he couldn't stop. The words poured out of Macarthur - O'Connell would visit his apartment regularly and the two men phoned each other quite often. Their conversations form the bulk of this book.So what kind of a man is Macarthur? Elusive, is the first word that springs to my mind. He is well-read, highly intelligent and in possession of an impressive memory, but a selective one. He talks to O'Connell in detail about his childhood, growing up on a vast estate in the Meath countryside. He speaks openly about his adult life, never having had a job, yet enjoying a luxurious lifestyle thanks to his inheritance. However, when it comes to discussing the murders, his memory becomes extremely vague and he describes it all in a detached style, as if he was merely a bystander in those events. He clearly has a massive ego and I think it would be fair to say he enjoys his notoriety to a certain extent.O'Connell, for his part, grows apprehensive with how close the two men get. At one point Macarthur mentions that they seem to have become friends, and he finds that notion very uncomfortable. He talks about spending time at home with his daughter, and seeing Macarthur's number flash up on his phone in her presence makes him feel incredibly uneasy about the whole venture.The book is a fascinating glimpse into the mind of a killer, and the fact that Macarthur does not fit the profile of your typical murderer makes it all the more intriguing. O'Connell is a terrific writer - I admired the way he included his misgivings about dedicating his time to writing about such a gruesome deed. But I do think it's worth trying to understand the motivations of such an individual. Ultimately, I found their conversations a little frustrating, but this is not down to O'Connell's efforts. I get the feeling Macarthur will never tell us the full story, and his explanation that the murders were solely driven by money will never entirely convince me. This is true crime with a difference - a perceptive and thoughtful study of an unknowable, twisted mind....more",Notes are private!,2,34,1,"Jun 27, 2023","Jul 02, 2023","Jun 27, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/63366030-a-thread-of-violence

The car dealership that Dickie runs is imploding and the rest of the family are beginning to feel the heat. His wife Imelda, a rare beauty, is dismayed to find her lavish lifestyle upended. But she's carrying deeper wounds, and can't shake the notion that Dickie's late brother Frank was her true soulmate. Eldest child Cass is hoping to go university if the family's financial state allows it, though she's more troubled by confused feelings for her undependable pal Elaine. Younger brother PJ is a worrier who is bullied at school - his online friendship with a boy called Ethan is the one hope he clings to. None of them know the anguish that Dickie is going through, as a dark episode from his days at Trinity College still hangs over him. The pressure builds for each family member until it all comes together in a shattering climax.This is Paul Murray's fourth novel, and he's probably best known for Skippy Dies, a wonderful tragicomic tale of a Dublin boarding school. There isn't as much humour in his latest effort, as the Barnes household lurches from one crisis to the next. The story is narrated in turn by each family member and their voices are distinct. Cass contends with a crush and her sexuality, while my heart bled for PJ, a true innocent who tries his best to do the right thing. I struggled a bit with Imelda's account, not because of the content, but due to the stream of consciousness style it is written in. Dickie's plight though was what moved me most of all: a repressed, tragic figure who is haunted by shame and regret. The book is definitely too long, but it's worth hanging around for the end, as we wonder if the breathless gossip recounted on the first page will echo for the Barnes's. This is an ambitious family saga, rich in pathos, that will reward the patience of its readers.Favourite Quotes:""It was the best time, that season of the self; for the most part he was happy, happier than he had ever been. Perhaps that was what made it hard to accept. He had always assumed happiness was for other people, for the plodders, the norms, the sleepwalkers, as the reward for their blinkered conformism. He felt like he ’d been initiated into a secret cult – a group of people who outwardly looked like everybody else, but who concealed a miraculous secret: they were in love.""""The world was made with this kind of life in mind, he came to realise. The world was a machine designed to sustain and perpetuate this kind of life – adult life, normal life. It wasn’t like college, when every moment bristled with pathways, alternatives, strangers and confusion. Everything was linear, everything made sense, the future appeared before him like a railway track, moment by moment, day by day, carrying him onwards without his needing to do a thing.""""She spent money furiously, compulsively. It was as if she didn’t quite believe in it and had to spend it to prove to herself it was real – which in turn made her worry that it was all gone, so she had to spend more to prove that it wasn’t. They were rich now, but she never seemed able to accept it, that this was her life. Instead, wealth was a disguise that had to be continually renewed.""""Only then, when it was lost, did he realise how much he had staked on the moment. For years, for decades, he had been hoping for it, dreaming of it, the time when they would be reunited – feeding himself minuscule doses of a world that could never be. If he hadn’t come here tonight, he could have carried on with it for the rest of his life. Now it was gone.""""This must be what it feels like to be dying, he thinks; the world remains around you, like a lover who does not want to hurt you by leaving, but in spirit it’s already gone, taking with it the meaning of everything you shared. In truth it is already transforming into a future you will never be part of; and you realise only then that it has been transforming all of this time, throughout your whole life, and you with it; and that, in fact, is life, though you never knew, and now it is over.""...more",Notes are private!,0,47,1,"Jun 20, 2023","Jun 25, 2023","Jun 20, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/62039166-the-bee-sting

Living alone and having retired as a librarian, he struggles to fill the time. One day at the convenience store, he comes across an elderly woman who is both confused and lost. He returns her to the senior centre in which she resides. And enjoying this visit to the centre, Bob decides to volunteer there on a regular basis. He makes friends with some of the other residents, and reads to them from some of his favourite books, even though they are mostly disinterested. And then he makes a discovery that turns his life upside-down. We flash back to when Bob was in his 20s, and married to a young woman named Connie. He also had a friend back then, a colourful, lively fellow called Ethan. And gradually we find out why the three of them are no longer in contact.Bob is the hero of this story, if you can call him that. It feels like he's not even the main character in his own life, being as introverted as he is. But interesting things do happen around him sometimes. He's an easy guy to warm to, gentle and kind. And not bitter, even though he has every reason to be. I kept thinking of that Thoreau line (""The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation"") as I was reading this, and my heart went out to Bob. And I was thoroughly enjoying the book for the most part, until we flashed back earlier to when Bob was a boy, and ran away from home. He ended up befriending two elderly woman and trained to perform in their stage show. And this section of the novel felt completely out of place to me: it didn't fit with the rest of the story, and I found those ladies kind of annoying. So I'm afraid I'm deducting a star for that unwelcome detour. This book works best when it focuses on Bob's later years: facing up to old age and loneliness, weighing up his life and wondering where it all went. He's the kind of guy who deserves a shot at true happiness and you end the story hoping that it's finally coming his way.Favourite Quotes:""Bob had long given up on the notion of knowing anyone, or of being known. He communicated with the world partly by walking through it, but mainly by reading about it.""""Sometimes he could forget what had happened for an hour, and sometimes a month. But whenever the memory was returned to him, he never reacted with bitterness, but took it up as a temporary discomfort. Days flattened fact, was the merciful truth of the matter. A bell was struck and it sang by the blow performed against it but the noise of the violence moved away and away and the bell soon was cold and mute, intact.""""There is such a thing as charisma, which is the ability to inveigle the devotion of others to benefit your personal cause; the inverse of charisma is horribleness, which is the phenomenon of fouling the mood of a room by simply being. Bob was neither one of these, and neither was he set at a midpoint between the extremes. He was to the side, out of the race completely.""""Melancholy is the wistful identification of time as thief, and it is rooted in memories of past love and success. Sorrow is a more hopeless proposition. Sorrow is the understanding you shall not get that which you crave and, perhaps, deserve, and it is rooted in, or encouraged by, excuse me, the death impulse.""""Maria understood that part of aging, at least for many of us, was to see how misshapen and imperfect our stories had to be.

I'll never experience motherhood, but after reading this novel I'm quite relieved about that fact. Claire Kilroy imagines it all as psychological horror in this raw and visceral tale.It's told by a woman, Soldier, speaking to her infant son, Sailor. Parenthood has completely taken over her life, and she is struggling, to put it mildly. Day-to-day stuff is grinding her down - the lack of sleep, the endless meal preparation, the nappy changes. That's all tough enough as it is, but then there are the bigger incidents involving her boy - like when he goes missing in IKEA, the time he bangs his head on the floor ending up with a bruise the size of a golf ball, his terrifying fever in the middle of the night, with her desperately trying to get hold of a doctor. It's no wonder she's at her wits' end. But it doesn't help that her husband is absolutely useless at parenting, and she resents him massively for it. They argue constantly. Her one ray of sunshine is a friend from school, who attends the same playground with his own band of rugrats. They reminisce about old times, when life was simpler.Because the story is from a single point of view, it's totally one-sided, and a few doubts begin to creep in about Sailor's account of certain things. However, the agony she is going through is unquestionable. We get an inside view into motherhood, and it's mostly negative to be honest. There are moments when the light creeps in, and love for her son threatens to make her heart burst. The final section of the novel in particular is incredibly moving as she talks about time - savouring precious years together in the future before age withers them both. But is it worth all the torture and mental anguish that she's currently experiencing? The bottom line is that she needs help, and she's not getting any. This one of those books that taught me about a part of life I now realise I know little about. I found it powerful and shocking - Soldier Sailor is not for the faint-hearted, and it leaves an indelible impression.Favourite Quotes:""The impulse to shove my husband hard in the chest was so strong that I turned and staggered away to thwart it, grappling with the doors and bannisters that came rearing up at me as if I was on a conveyor belt because I wasn't in my right mind any more.""""Our love was a song, I thought.

A fantasy novel featuring a non-white protagonist, written by a woman - well that kind of thing was rarer than hen's teeth back then. And though the story probably seems quite familiar these days, it has proved massively influential for generations of fantasy writers.It's all about a boy named Ged, who displays great prowess in the field of magic from a young age.

He's responsible for launching several popular magazines over the last 40 years, including Q and Mojo. But he's arguably most famous for being one of the presenters at Live Aid, encouraging Bob Geldof to turn the air blue in his efforts to raise money for Africa.This is a collection of essays written over the course of Hepworth's career, examining our relationship with pop music. It's quite varied in scope - he takes a look at the decline of record stores, the role of the radio DJ in modern culture, and the best songs to play at weddings. He believes the 60s was rock's greatest decade, so a number of pieces explore that era, with the Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan coming in for particular praise.However, it's quite easy to discern Hepworth's favourite band, and the best writing in this book relates to the Beatles. His most controversial theory is that the Fab Four were actually underrated, and I have to admit that after reading his thoughts I'm convinced he's right. He sings the praises of Ringo and takes a look at A Hard Day's Night fifty years after first watching that magical film in wide-eyed jubilation. Hepworth's passion and enthusiasm for the band shines through, and I'm a bit of a Beatles nut myself so I really enjoyed those pieces.I will say though that some of the essays, particularly those from the early 2000s, feel pretty dated right now. And the last section, a series of lists including his favourite gigs, felt like filler to me.

They're led by the irrepressible Mira, a fiery ball of grand ideas to save the planet, but lacking the basic organizational skills to get her mad schemes off the ground. That gap is filled by her friend Shelley, the sensible one, who is becoming tired of her pal's scattergun ways and has plans to leave the group. Complicating things is Tony, a headstrong old flame of Mira's who has returned after several years abroad, with notions of making his name as a hotshot journalist. One day Mira scouts what she believes to be an abandoned farm in Korowai National Park, an ideal location for her modus operandi of growing crops without permission. But she bumps into Robert Lemoine, an American billionaire who has paid a deposit for the property. Lemoine offers to fund Birnam Wood's occupation of the land, with the idea that it will help his bid for New Zealand citizenship. What Mira doesn't know is that Lemoine is using them, as he has his own shady intentions for the farm. Birnam Wood is Eleanor Catton's long-awaited follow-up to 2013's Booker-winning The Luminaries. She takes her time with the beginning of this story, going deep to introduce the personalities and motivations of the main characters. And this initial lack of action might test the patience of some readers. However, perseverance is rewarded, as a tragic event ups the stakes significantly. The final pages left me holding my breath and the ending has been on my mind ever since.

So every now and then I read a book like this to challenge my thinking. It didn't change my mind, but I still found it pretty intriguing.Back in 1966, the Aberfan disaster occurred, a terrible tragedy that claimed the lives of 144 people, many of them children. John Barker, a psychiatrist with an interest in rare medical conditions, visited the site and was struck by stories of two kids who seemed to have predicted the fatal landslide. He wrote to Peter Fairley, the science editor of the Evening Standard, asking him to print an appeal for people who had experienced premonitions of the disaster to contact the newspaper, and they received 76 letters.This prompted Barker and Fairley to set up what they called the Premonitions Bureau, in which they encouraged the public to send in their dreams and predictions of the future. The vast majority of them were completely wrong, but two correspondents in particular were able to forecast events with unusual accuracy. Kathleen Middleton, a music teacher, and Alan Hencher, a post office worker, both predicted a fatal train wreck in London the day before it occurred. They foresaw all kinds of assassinations and catastrophes, describing exact details with alarming precision.After this is where the book lost me. Instead of investigating the two star predictors in further detail, it chooses to focus on the life of Barker. He enjoyed the limelight and his research brought him fame on both sides of the Atlantic. However, I wanted to know more about the subjects of Barker's study instead of the man himself.

Far From Home is a collection of his short stories, ranging from publication in the 1950s to the 1980s.Most of these tales fit the description of speculative fiction. They're set in the present day but science and reason is ever so slightly stretched.

Too many of them didn't go anywhere or else ended abruptly. And I would venture to say that a lot of them haven't aged very well, particularly the Oedipal undertones of A Visit From Mother.

Her comedic talents are in no doubt in this effort, but she demonstrates a rare insight into modern relationships too.The story is narrated by Maggie, a 29-year-old woman living in Toronto. She has just separated from Jon, the only man she's ever dated, and she's struggling, to put it mildly. She's torn between wanting to win him back and getting on with her life. Dating is mostly a disaster, even though she does meet one interesting chap called Simon, before getting rid of him for being too nice. She has a self-destructive streak as you can see. Luckily Maggie has a great group of friends to depend on, but this is a tumultuous period in her life, and it's going to take some big changes to turn it around.As I read, I kept thinking that this was like a Nora Ephron book for millennials.

There are One of my all-time favourite novels is The Secret History, so whenever I hear of a book being compared to it, my ears immediately prick up. There are some similarities in If We Were Villains for sure - it's a campus novel, in which a group of precocious, pretentious students are involved in gruesome murder. However, I'm afraid that's where the affinity ends, for it doesn't really hold a candle to Donna Tartt's amazing debut.Oliver Marks is our narrator and he has just served ten years in prison for the crime in which he was implicated. Pressed by the detective who put him there, he decides to tell his story and set the record straight. We flash back to a decade earlier when Oliver was one of a group of seven friends at an elite acting school. They are a mixture of personalities - some are bold and extroverted, others more sensitive and timid. Oliver himself is more of a follower than a leader, but he has a kind heart. Tensions are high as the roles for the final year play are announced, and when the teachers decide to mix the casting up a bit, it sets in motion a tragic series of events.The praise on the blurb of the book states that it has 'a shocking twist you won't forget' - well in that case my copy must be missing some pages, because I found it all quite predictable. Rio does a decent job of building tension and generating high stakes relationships among the group. But I must admit that I found most of the characters quite irritating, especially their constant habit of quoting Shakespeare in everyday conversations.

Scott Carey usually registers around 240 pounds, but his bathroom scales are now telling him that he's 28 lbs lighter than that. And it keeps dropping day after day. His doctor friend is baffled but Scott doesn't want to go for any tests. Instead he begins to notice the world around him in Castle Rock. One particular injustice catches his eye, a lesbian couple whose restaurant is struggling due to the opinions of some of the town's more conservative residents. He makes it his mission to improve their situation, despite their reluctance, and makes some new friends along the way.This is a lightweight (pardon the pun) tale from King - a short and sweet account of one man trying to make the world a better place.

The body of a man was found on a beach and despite an extensive police investigation, he was never identified. There were no signs of foul play or drowning, but a post-mortem revealed that he had an advanced stage of cancer. In this tale, Sheila Armstrong imagines all of the people that were linked to the discovery, from the elderly woman who found him, the bus driver that drove him to Sligo and the homeless man who ended up with his backpack. This is not the first time something unusual has washed up on shore. There is also the matter of a recent shipwreck, a local curiosity that no owner has ever claimed. The story delves into its history and the enigma of the dead man, peeling back the lives of everybody involved.This is Sheila Armstrong's first novel after the widely acclaimed short story collection, How To Gut A Fish. It's quite a melancholy tale - the sadness of a sick man dying completely alone is what moved me most of all. And the mystery of his passing certainly kept me in suspense. However, the main reason I enjoyed the novel is the expert way in which Armstrong imagines the lives of various villagers, revealing the things that make them happy and the troubles that keep them awake at night. The story is written in such a lyrical, perceptive way that had me highlighting multiple lines on my Kindle edition. It's a haunting, intricately spun novel that marks this author out as a serious talent.Favourite Quotes:""There is an aching sadness, in the car, but it is untethered: the dead man is a stranger to them.

This one is also set in her native Nigeria and focuses primarily on two characters from vastly different backgrounds. Eniola is a teenage boy who comes from a struggling family. His father has recently lost his job and can't afford to pay his son's school fees. Eniola is even forced to beg on the street outside church, and when an offer of free food plus easy money comes his way he jumps at it, but of course there's a catch. Meanwhile Wuraola, a 28-year-old doctor, comes from wealth. On the surface things are going well for her. She has an exciting career and is set to marry her partner, Kunle. However, there are problems in that relationship which she can't bring herself to admit. Even though they come from opposite sides of the track, Eniola and Wuraola's lives are about to collide in an unexpected way.Adebayo uses her story to examine several different themes, such as the crushing effects of poverty and the very different pressures of operating in more affluent circles. She addresses family and social issues in a thoughtful way, and I was impressed at how she explored the difficulty in escaping an abusive relationship. The best part of the book for me was the ending - a powerful and shocking finale that left me reeling. However, I thought it took much too long to get to that point.

It's very much Matthew Perry's own story, and it focuses almost entirely on his crippling battle with addiction. The TV show that made him famous doesn't really get that much attention, and his co-stars don't get many mentions either (save for the massive crush he had on Jennifer Aniston).The book begins with a bang, literally, as Perry's colon explodes due to drug abuse, and he is extremely lucky to survive. He takes us back to growing up in Canada, the son of a TV journalist and an actor. He was an excellent tennis player as a boy and had thoughts of pursuing it as a career, but decided to move to Hollywood with his Dad and follow him into the family business. He picked up a few small parts before eventually landing the role that turned him into a world famous celebrity.I think what surprised me most of all was that Perry struggled with addiction even before he became successful. He talks about drinking to excess as a teenager and you get the feeling that he would have had problems even if fame never got a hold on him. He has spent an estimated $7 million dollars on rehab and is clean as the book is published, but I'm afraid to say another setback never feels far away.There was no ghostwriter involved in this project and it shows. Perry can write, but his account becomes very repetitive, as he goes into detail on every relapse and all of the relationships he has destroyed. The final chapters of the book tail off into a rambling affirmation of the person he is today. I felt sorry for him by the end - addiction is a disease after all, and he strikes me as a very lonely person, despite all of his success.

He wasn't alone in his efforts, aided by seven other brave souls who refer to themselves as 'the choir'. Their planning is meticulous, and it needs to be, for discovery means death. The villain of the piece is Paul Hauptmann, Hitler's representative in Rome, and a man with a penchant for torture. He knows some kind of escape line is operating and suspects O'Flaherty is involved.

Though it's an unauthorized account, writer Alan Shipnuck set upThis explosive biography generated a ton of controversy before it was even published. Though it's an unauthorized account, writer Alan Shipnuck set up a phone call with subject Phil Mickelson to set the record straight on a few things. During that conversation, the topic of the contentious LIV tour came up, and Mickelson acknowledged the fact that the Saudis were ""scary motherf*kers"" who executed journalists and gay people, but that it was too good an opportunity to turn down. These comments rocked the world of golf. Mickelson maintained that their chat was off the record, Shipnuck says that he will go to his grave knowing that wasn't the case. I know who I believe.So the book had a lot of fanfare to live up to, and it gives me great pleasure to say that it is a hugely enjoyable read. The first chapter is worth the price of admission alone. In it, Shipnuck asks several people from the golfing fraternity to tell their favourite Phil story, jumping from one outrageous anecdote to the next. It really sets the pace for the rest of the book and leaves you salivating for more juicy gossip.Shipnuck then goes into detail on Mickelson's upbringing and early development as a prodigious golfer. He attended Arizona State University and had a whale of a time there, meeting his future wife Amy, who is an absolute saint by all accounts. He burst onto the wider golf scene by winning his first PGA Tour event while still an amateur. This heralded the start of a stunning professional career as Mickelson began to rack up the wins, but he had the misfortune of existing at the same time as Tiger Woods, the best ever to play the game. And there is no love lost between the two, Phil's brash personality clashing strongly with Tiger's introverted tendencies. Despite his success, Mickelson was in danger of becoming one of the best players never to win a Major, a title nobody wants. But his memorable victory at the 2003 Masters changed that statistic, and he has gone on to win six Majors in total, cementing his legacy as one of the game's all-time greats.So what kind of person is Mickelson behind it all? It's hard to say for sure, according to Shipnuck, he's a bit of an enigma. He's definitely an alpha male, one of the loudest voices in the dressing room. He's dedicated to his wife, and generous to a fault, doing all kinds of amazing work for charity. He's not afraid to speak his mind, and this has got him into trouble on more than one occasion. He also has a wicked sense of humour, the kind that some people enjoy, but others take offence to.The book is not a hagiography of Mickelson by any means. Shipnuck doesn't shy away from examining Mickelson's darker side, including the aforementioned LIV tour. He takes a look at Phil's notorious gambling habits and his association with Billy Walters, a man who was convicted for insider trading. Phil's name came up during Walters' case and you get the feeling that he was extremely lucky to escape that one scot-free. The distasteful separation between Mickelson and his loyal caddy Bones Mackay also gets a mention and Phil doesn't come out of that one smelling of roses.At the end of it all, the undeniable fact is that Phil Mickelson is a larger-than-life character, and that the game of golf would be much less colourful without him. Alan Shipnuck tells his riveting story in style - I can't think of a sports biography that has entertained me as much as this one....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Dec 27, 2022","Jan 08, 2023","Dec 27, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/60386703-phil

In thisJude Rogers is a well-known music journalist in the UK, with her work appearing in the likes of The Guardian and The Times on a regular basis. In this book she looks at the songs that have soundtracked the most important moments in her life, and explore the reason why music plays such an important role in times of happiness and heartbreak.Each chapter is based around one particular song and there are twelve in all. But there is an introduction before the record begins and I must admit that I found it unbearably moving. Little Jude is five years old, standing on the doorstep as her Dad waves goodbye before a hospital operation. They both share a love of pop music and before he leaves, he asks her to let him know what song goes to number one in that week's chart. He died two days later. Rogers thinks back to this moment a lot - why that information mattered to her father and why it has carried such weight in her mind ever since. She realises that music was their profound way of connecting with one another and that the songs they loved were a magical extension of their ordinary lives.The rest of the tracks signify other important occasions throughout Rogers' childhood, adolescence and career as a critic. Adam Ant's Prince Charming showed her just how exciting and colourful music could be. Neneh Cherry's performance of Buffalo Stance on Top of the Pops while pregnant proved an inspirational example of a woman making it in the music business. R.E.M.'s Drive soundtracked her teen obsession with Michael Stipe and her thrill at interviewing her hero several years later.My favourite chapter of all was the final one, in which she speaks to Prefab Sprout genius Paddy McAloon. Rogers talks about music not working for her in the same way during Covid, losing some of its enchantment, until she hears Prefab Sprout's epic I Trawl The Megahertz on her car radio and regains her sense of direction. She gets to interview McAloon and they discuss the strange power of music - for example, how you can often remember the mundane details around first hearing a spectacular song. In McAloon's case he can recall heading into his house for lunch as a teenager and bending down to tie his shoelace as the first bars of Chic's Good Times entered his eardrums. He can still see his shoelace and the crappy old radio it played on because it is such an indelible moment in his mind.Rogers also talks to several scientists in the book to understand what is going on in our brains whenever we hear a song we love. I'm afraid I began to skim some of those parts as I don't find the mechanics of it all that interesting. For me it's enough that the magic happens, I don't need the trick explained to me. But that's down to my own taste and I'm sure other readers would find it intriguing. What I loved most about this book was the personal insight, and in particular the emotion Jude Rogers injects into her writing. I can't help but admire how she has turned her passion into her career and the eloquent way in which she tells her story.

For the most part, I thought it was solid, but it didn't blow me away. Then it hit me with a gut-punch and I haven't been able to get it out of my head since.The story is set in Northern Ireland at the height of the Troubles. Cushla Lavery is a 24-year-old primary school teacher, living in a Catholic household on the outskirts of Belfast. Her mother Gina is an alcoholic and she spends evenings helping out at her brother Eamonn's bar. Cushla is popular among her students, taking a real shine to Davy, a seven-year-old who comes from a mixed Protestant-Catholic family, and bullied because of it. Into the bar one evening comes Michael Agnew, a charismatic barrister. Cushla gets talking to him and there is an undeniable attraction, even though he's much older, married and a Protestant. He asks her to teach the Irish language to him and some of his friends and a relationship blossoms between the pair. But they both know deep down that this affair can't go on forever, and it ends up in a tragic place that neither of them were prepared for.Kennedy does a great job of describing everyday life during the Troubles, with the characters numb to the senseless violence they hear every day on the news, treating bomb scares and soldiers on the streets like they were a mundane formality. She captures the relationship between Cushla and Michael so brilliantly - the intensity, the guilt, the irresistible nature of it amid the knowledge that it won't last forever. The blow, when it comes, is masterfully delivered and absolutely devastating. It's a strong debut from Louise Kennedy and I can certainly see why it has been praised so highly....more",Notes are private!,0,44,1,"Nov 29, 2022","Dec 06, 2022","Nov 29, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60417483-trespasses

I've read several of his novels since in the hope of recapturing some of that magic, but nothing has quite hit those heights. However, I'm pleased to say that Lessons, his latest effort, stands right up there with the very best of his work.It's one of those 'whole life' stories, or 'cradle to grave' if you prefer. The life in question is that of Roland Baines, a pianist and part-time journalist living in Clapham. At the beginning of this tale he finds himself in a very difficult situation. His German wife Alissa has gone missing, leaving him to take care of their baby son Lawrence. The police are notified and for a short while Roland is suspected in the case, but it soon transpires that Alissa is fine - she has just decided to abandon her family in pursuit of a career. Roland looks back on what has brought his life to this point, in particular his time at boarding school, and an illicit relationship with a piano teacher that had a transformative impact on his personality. He reminisces about his romance with Alissa and tries to find clues to her unhappiness. Gradually he comes to terms with his circumstances, finding contentment and struggling with heartbreak in whole new ways.As well as Roland's challenges in everyday life, McEwan describes him reacting to major world events, which lends a layer of authenticity to the story. He is a Labour member in his youth, buoyed by Tony Blair's arrival at 10 Downing St, appalled by Brexit in his later years. He despairs at the politics of the present day, with people swayed by populist, hate-filled propaganda: ""It often happened like this, Roland thought, the world was wobbling badly on its axis, ruled in too many places by shameless ignorant men, while freedom of expression was in retreat and digital public spaces resounded with the shouts of delirious masses. Truth had no consensus.""However, what really makes the story special are the reflections Roland has on his own existence. Even though he's quite unaccomplished professionally, he is a deep thinker, and comes to some profound observations. Alissa's departure causes him to reevaluate things and he contends that: ""In your mid-thirties you could begin to ask what kind of person you were. The first long run of turbulent young adulthood was over. So too was excusing yourself by reference to your background. Insufficient parents? A lack of love? Too much of it? Enough, no more excuses. You had friends of a dozen years or more. You could see your reflection in their eyes. You could or should have been in and out of love. You would have spent useful time alone. You had a measure of public life and your relation to it. Your responsibilities would be pressing in, helping to define you. Parenthood must cast some light.""He looks back on his life with Alissa (who is now an author of some renown) and realises that even his own memories can't do their relationship justice, to really capture what it was like in the moments it was alive: ""But there was that essence everyone forgets when a love recedes into the past—how it was, how it felt and tasted to be together through seconds, minutes and days, before everything that was taken for granted was discarded then overwritten by the tale of how it all ended, and then by the shaming inadequacies of memory.""The parts of the novel I found most affecting were its opinions on ageing, as I am entering my fifth decade myself and seeing its effect on my own parents. Roland first comes to terms with his folks' mortality and it is difficult to process: ""He had reached that point—late thirties was common—when one’s parents set off on their downhill journey. Up until that time they had owned whoever they were, whatever they did. Now, little bits of their lives were beginning to fall away or fly off suddenly like the shattered wing mirror from the Major’s car."" In his own old age, he can't believe how fast time is moving, and it is a cause of sadness for him and his peers: ""Two years sat lightly in memory, like two months. Time’s gathering compression was a commonplace among his old friends. They routinely shared their impressions of an unfair acceleration.""I realise I am quoting many lines here and that's because my Kindle is strewn with paragraphs I've highlighted. I found Roland's conclusions truly perceptive and, in many cases, felt like they chimed with my own. Some ers may argue that he is too passive a character to be memorable but I would argue that he's quite aware of this (""How easy it was to drift through an unchosen life, in a succession of reactions to events.""). And in any case, it doesn't make his hard-won insights any less significant. I feel like I got to know Roland Baines as well as some of my own friends and it was a real pleasure to be in his company.

The walls are so thin that the residents can't help but get involved in one another's lives. Blandine is the main character, a beautiful but damaged 18-year-old girl. Obsessed with mystics and out of body experiences, she reads book after book on the subject. She shares a flat with three teenage boys who have been through the foster care system. One of her neighbours is Joan, a lonely woman who suffers from misophonia and works as a moderator for an obituary website. A commentor on the site has had his post deleted by Joan and he plans to get his own back in a strange way. The story builds towards a catastrophic event, which will affect the lives of these people in ways they might never have expected.I've seen rave s everywhere for this novel and last week it won the National Book Award. As to how much I enjoyed reading it, I'm not so sure. Gunty is positively an exciting talent - the way she can inhabit and breathe life into the different voices of these characters shows a tremendous amount of skill. She is perceptive on the subject of loneliness and clearly understands the strain of poverty. I also liked how the story is told through different media - newspaper reports, website comments and even a chapter of illustrations. But I couldn't shake the feeling that there is too much going on here and it's happening mostly in isolation - the main characters are very much in their own heads and don't really interact with each another much until the end. And there were parts of Blandine's story that just didn't interest me - any time she started to talk about her beloved mystics my eyes began to glaze over. So while I do have some issues with this particular story, I am impressed with the author's ability and ambition, and would certainly be interested to read her next effort....more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"Nov 15, 2022","Nov 21, 2022","Nov 15, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59576076-the-rabbit-hutch

Our best work is never too far from our worst, and when we get too professional or too hip, our audience seems to shrink. It’s as if we need to be up against the odds.""Bono, being the driven, outspoken individual that he is, has always had a tendency to rub some people the wrong way. The thing is, he knows this very well. And that's one of the reasons why Surrender is such a pleasure to read. It's one of the most self-aware rockstar memoirs I have ever come across. He's as willing to talk about the band's failures (the iTunes fiasco for example) as their years of glorious success, and cringe at some of his own missteps, that mullet at Live Aid hilariously included.The book is divided into 40 chapters, each structured around a particular U2 song. It's a concept that works well. One finds the quartet at a creative crossroads during the recording of Achtung Baby, doubting their abilities, but its beautiful result unites them into something even stronger. Even Better Than The Real Thing provides the backdrop to Adam Clayton's lowest point in Sydney, a wake-up call for the band. With or Without You frames Bono's alliance with soulmate Ali, a romantic account of their early marriage, living in a windswept Martello tower on the Irish coast.You get a real sense of what matters most to Bono, and family means everything. He talks candidly about the death of his mother Iris at 14. It left him a lost boy in a house of taciturn men, who never spoke about the heartbreaking loss they all felt. There was an age gap to older brother Norman, and his father Bob was the strong, silent type. Their frosty relationship thawed as both men grew older and a mutual respect blossomed. Bono also talks lovingly about his four children and you get the feeling that the actress Eve is the apple of his eye.Of course, Bono has a second family, that of his legendary band. I loved his memories of their early days in the group, rehearsing in Larry's tiny kitchen, their parents driving them to gigs. It was a struggle, but he seems to remember that time fondly, badgering their manager Paul McGuinness to get them a van they could travel in and that all-important record deal. He speaks respectfully of his relationship with each band member, but doesn't go into too much detail. On this side of things, U2 fans probably won't learn anything new.The final third of the book takes a look at his other job - Bono the statesman. And I must admit it's the part I found least interesting. There is no doubt his achievements in cancelling African debt and the fight against AIDS are commendable, and a testament to his unbending will. But the reports of his efforts to sway the minds of politicians like George W. Bush and Condoleezza Rice go on for too long and probably need to be reined in.The book is lightly edited - however, Bono's eloquent writing and the structure make it work. He has a lyrical way of looking at the world, which some might regard as blather, but it won me over. Surrender will leave you in no doubt that Bono's intentions are admirable, and these self-deprecating, witty recollections of his colourful life are an undeniable treat....more",Notes are private!,3,186,1,"Nov 09, 2022","Nov 13, 2022","Nov 09, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61065813-surrender

She looks back wistfully to her adolescence in upstate New York, particularly the summer of 1972. Then she was 15, working as a ticket collector in an amusement park called Storyland. Her best friend was Sils, a beautiful girl who was popular with all the boys. Together they got up all manner of high-jinks, sneaking cigarettes behind the rides and staying out all night at bars using faking IDs. Things got complicated when Sils became pregnant, and Berie went above and beyond to help her troubled pal. It all led to events that tested their special bond to its limits.It's quite a melancholic story, this one. Berie is obviously unhappy with her life at present, but even her memories of that eventful summer are tinged with regret.

There was a loss of innocence as the two of them were forced to grow up fast, and I wonder if Berie would do things differently, were she to relive that era again.

I've been a gamer since the Atari 2600, and I used to work for a well-known video game company many moons ago. These days I'm more inclined towards casual Nintendo Switch play, but when I heard rave s of a story set in the gaming industry of the 90s and 00s, I knew had to check it out.The plot revolves around two lifelong friends. 12-year-old Sam Masur is recovering from an accident in hospital, when in walks Sadie Green, who is visiting her older sister. The pair bond over Super Mario Bros in the children's rec room and spend days playing together while Sam recuperates. The relationship fractures however when he discovers that Sadie has been recording their meetings as community service in preparation for her bat mitzvah. Years later, Sam spots Sadie in a Boston train station and their camaraderie is rekindled. He is wowed by Solution, an innovative game that Sadie has made for a college class, and they talk excitedly about designing one together. With the help of Marx, Sam's charismatic and wealthy room-mate, they set about creating Ichigo, a video game that will write their name in history. But as their reputation grows, challenges arise in both their personal and professional lives, and their friendship hits the rocks more than once.Anyone with a love of video games will find much to enjoy in this absorbing novel. Zevin clearly knows her stuff and references to 90s gaming staples will appeal to players' nostalgia for simpler times. However, you don't have to be a gamer to appreciate a tale with as much love for its characters as this one. You really feel like you get to know Sam and Sadie intimately, and experience their success and heartbreak first hand. I wouldn't describe the book as high literature, but it's a study of friendship and grief that feels as perceptive as any I've read in a while.

Empire of Pain was one of the best ed books of 2021, a searing exposé of the Sackler family and the opioid crisis they helped initiate. I can personally recommend Say Nothing, a fresh and hugely compelling exploration of the Troubles in Northern Ireland.Rogues is a collection of Radden Keefe's longform articles that originally appeared in the New Yorker. As the title suggests they focus on all manner of rascals, from lighter accounts of mischief makers and disruptors, to heavier fare that examines the lives of terrorists and murderers.And I have to be completely honest: I didn't love all of them. I'm not interested in the illegal drug trade, so The Hunt for El Chapo was a piece that I found myself skimming through. Similarly, The Prince of Marbella, about the efforts to catch an international arms dealer didn't grab me at all. And the opening article which takes a look at the rare fine wine industry, was a strange choice to start the book, in my opinion. But this is all down to personal taste, I'm sure they will have plenty of admirers besides my dissenting views.However, I'm happy to say that there were several pieces I thoroughly enjoyed. The Worst of the Worst is the intriguing tale of the attorney Judy Clarke and her efforts to defend Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, one of the notorious Boston bombers. Journeyman is a beautiful account of time spent with Anthony Bourdain, the food critic and author, which left me saddened at his tragic, untimely demise. But the standout article in my opinion is A Loaded Gun, so good that it prompts me to add an extra star to this . It investigates Amy Bishop, a professor at the University of Alabama who opened fire on six colleagues during a staff meeting in 2010. It's a masterpiece of true crime reporting, a riveting delve into a highly unusual mass shooting that might have been prevented if earlier events in Bishop's life had been given due care and attention. It's still available on the New Yorker website and I highly recommend taking some time out to read it.It's a pretty wide-ranging collection and there is something here for everybody. It's hard not to be enthralled by Radden Keefe's inquisitive mind - he possesses a dogged inclination to get to the truth of the matter at hand. But he's also a talented storyteller, dangling clues and dropping revelations that compel the reader to keep turning the pages. I'm sure that curious, whirring brain has many more fascinating tales to recount, and I can't wait to bury my nose in them....more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"Oct 18, 2022","Oct 23, 2022","Oct 18, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59148726-rogues

Calliope Stephanides introduces himself as a 41-year-old Greek-American hermaphrodite, now working with the US State Department in Germany. We know that Cal was raised as a girl but have to wait a while to find out how everything changed for him. Eugenides takes us all the way back to Cal's grandparents, Desdemona and Lefty, who grew up in the Greek port of Smyrna. When the city is besieged by Turks they flee to America, getting married on ship. The only problem is that they are brother and sister, and they carry they gene that will affect Cal in later life. They settle in Detroit and have children, one of whom is Milton, Cal's father. Milton becomes the successful owner of a hot-dog franchise and his young family grow up in middle-class suburbia. Cal is sent to a girl's school where she begins to have confusing feelings for a classmate, setting events in motion for a shocking discovery.Middlesex was Eugenides' long-awaited follow-up to The Virgin Suicides and went on to win the Pulitzer Prize. I can see why it's so acclaimed. It's such a panoramic, wide-ranging novel in the way that it goes into detail on the lives of Cal's forebears, taking in Greek tragedy and American enterprise. Even side characters are given plenty of focus, such as the bootlegger Jimmy Zizmo and Father Mike, Milton's love rival. If I have a small complaint, it's around the pacing of the novel. I was interested to find out about Cal's ancestors but maybe too much time is given to them - the chapters describing Detroit of the 1920s that they lived in slowed the story down. The real attraction here is Cal - you read on to discover how his change in circumstances came about, and root for him to find happiness at long last. Considering the discourse around gender identity at present, this novel was well ahead of its time. It's an epic family saga, an examination of the American Dream, and an empathetic tale of one's person's journey to self-discovery, all rolled into one....more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,"Oct 10, 2022","Oct 16, 2022","Oct 14, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2187.Middlesex

Majella O'Neill is a 27-year-old woman who lives with her irresponsible and self-absorbed mother Nuala. Her father disappeared years ago and she still misses him badly, watching Dallas on DVD to remember the happy times they once spent together. And her grandmother was found dead in her mobile home recently, the victim of a brutal beating. So Majella has had to deal with plenty of heartache, but she remains resolute. Her chief purpose in life is a job at the local chip shop, A Salt and Battered, where she serves an array of colourful characters every night. She also has a kind of relationship with Marty, her co-worker, which seems mostly physical. The story follows a week in her life, where Majella will have to deal with further trauma and some big surprises.It might sound like a depressing kind of story given Majella's circumstances, but it's got lots of humour in it too. Majella is a funny narrator - she has a very cynical way of looking at the world and a sarcastic tone, which makes for plenty of laughs. She is lonely though, that much is obvious, and there are signs that she is struggling to cope with the pressure. It's hard not to feel sorry for her. Gallen does a great job of capturing the comings and goings of a small town, with everybody knowing your business, like it or not. The customers at the chip shop are richly imagined, with Majella knowing the backstory of each of them, even predicting what they are about to order. There is also a sense of community, which she turns away from, most likely because of the hurt and shame she is feeling due to her family situation. The one criticism I would have of Gallen's writing style is that she's not that keen on paragraphs - too often I was faced with a wall of text on a page that made for a less than pleasant reading experience.

Douglas Stuart has proved that the magnificent Shuggie Bain was no fluke. If I read a better novel than Young Mungo this year, I'll be amazed.Again the story is set among the mean streets of Glasgow, but this time we're in the 1990s. Mungo Hamilton is 15, the youngest of three Protestant children. His mother Mo-Maw is an alcoholic and rarely seen at their small flat. Instead, he is raised by his sister Jodie, only a year older but with a steeliness and wisdom that belies her youth. Eldest brother Hamish is feared gang leader who spends most of his time organizing battles against the hated Catholics. Mungo is lost, but he does make a friend in James, a young neighbour who races pigeons. The time they spend together is an ocean of calm amid the stormy seas of Mungo's everyday life. Intertwined with the main plot is an account of a fishing trip that Mungo is sent on with two older men, and a sense of foreboding is hard to ignore.It's a long time since I've felt such sympathy for a fictional character. Mungo is so confused and anxious - he even has a tic that makes his face twitch when he gets stressed. He yearns for compassion from Mo-Maw, treats her like a queen and gets nothing in return. When his friendship with James looks like it might turn into something more, you're absolutely rooting for him. If anybody deserves a shot at happiness it's poor Mungo, a caring, thoughtful boy who has been dealt such a bad hand.I also loved how well the lives of secondary characters are fleshed out. Jodie dreams of escaping to university but an affair with an older man threatens to scupper her plans. Chickie Calhoun is a gay man who lives alone and has to deal with horrible slurs thrown his way every day, but he shows Mungo more kindness that some of his family ever have. And in a standout chapter, Mungo and Jodie come to the rescue of a neighbour who is being battered by her husband one night, and end up stunned by her reaction.There is such an ominous tone to the story and you can't help thinking that this won't end well for our young protagonist. But you read on hoping for a chink of light in the darkness of his miserable life. Douglas Stuart is masterful storyteller and he has created an unforgettable character in Mungo. It's a powerful, heartbreaking tale from one of the very best writers around.Favourite Quotes:""The man was trembling slightly. Years spent hiding from daylight in dark pubs had given him the nervous reactions of a whippet pushed out into the snow, and he had the small darting eyes and long twitching limbs of a mistreated dog.""""Beyond these sat the broken promises of Sighthill. The high-rise towers were only twenty years old and were already in a state of disrepair. They were the tallest buildings Mungo had ever seen. The tops of them disappeared into the dense clouds, like a stairway to somewhere above the endless rain, or like a strut trying to keep the ceiling of dark cumulus from collapsing and suffocating the entire city.""""Jodie felt the floor tilt underneath her. Like a gable end slated for demolition, the front facade of her fell away and the private contents of her life rolled out. She was being torn down, and every mismatched bed sheet in her mind was to be exposed for all to see.""""She had asked for violence out of a gentle soul and it made her feel like she had trampled a patch of fresh snow.""""Mungo’s capacity for love frustrated her. His loving wasn’t selflessness; he simply couldn’t help it. Mo-Maw needed so little and he produced too much, so that it all seemed a horrible waste. It was a harvest no one had seeded, and it blossomed from a vine no one had tended. It should have withered years ago, like hers had, like Hamish’s had. Yet Mungo had all this love to give and it lay about him like ripened fruit and nobody bothered to gather it up.""...more",Notes are private!,0,62,1,"Sep 27, 2022","Oct 02, 2022","Sep 27, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58891551-young-mungo

First there is Mr Lloyd, an English artist who has come to paint the cliffs. He is fussy and demanding, immediately setting noses out of joint. But he does strike up a kind of friendship with 15-year-old James Gillan, reluctantly taking him on as an apprentice. The other notable visitor is Jean-Pierre Masson, a Frenchman who has spent the last few summers on the island studying the Irish language, which is slowly dying out. The two men clash - Lloyd can't concentrate on his work with all the hubbub Masson is making, while Masson is annoyed by the artist speaking English, a malign influence on the locals. Also, they both have eyes on James's mother Mairéad, a beautiful widow. Interspersed with all of this activity are reports of murders in Northern Ireland, with the Troubles at its height.There is so much going on in this thoughtfully written novel. Magee deftly examines common themes like grief and jealousy, while carefully considering other subjects like the struggles of living on an isolated, rocky outpost, or a culture becoming extinct. Even the pressure a person can feel to follow in the family way of life is explored in the expectation that James will become a fisherman, like his father, who died at sea. I initially wondered what the bulletins from Northern Ireland had to do with it all but I believe they are employed to contrast with the island's more peaceful existence. We eventually learn that they are being heard on the radio in the Gillan house - the rising violence they describe becomes harder to ignore and it all lends itself to the notion that the island is being shaped by external influences, like it or not. The one aspect of the book that I didn't find all that interesting was Masson's childhood and his struggle with French/Algerian identity.

His execution is a matter of hours away, but he has a plan to escape. He has befriended Shawna, one of the guards, and she has agreed to help him. She has also promised to print the manifesto he has been writing in his cell, a treatise on the subject of good and evil. As one narrative counts down the minutes to his lethal injection, another alternating timeline looks at some of the women in Ansel's life. Lavender is the abused mother who abandoned him when he was four years old, along with his baby brother. Hazel is the twin sister of Jenny, his former wife, who always had a bad feeling about Ansel. And Saffron is a detective who had a frightening encounter with him when they were teenagers. The clock ticks towards Ansel's appointment with his executioner and we learn more about his murky past.I always feel uneasy when admitting to enjoying stories involving murder. This one is fiction of course, but it gets so inside the head of a killer that at times it felt real to me. Ansel is forever haunted by the screams of his baby brother and this trauma has clouded his whole life. From his prison cell, he feels like he deserves sympathy. He also exudes a sense of superiority, as evidenced by his manifesto, which will explain to the world the true nature of good and evil. But the other timeline, which focuses on his victims and the devastation his callous acts left behind, leave no room for pity of this cold-blooded murderer. It's an intriguing concept to present these narratives side by side, and let us decide whether Ansel is a casualty of circumstance, or a malicious individual who always had a violent streak in him.

I've previously read and enjoyed His Bloody Project and The Disappearance of Adèle Bedeau. So when his most recent novel earned its place on the Booker longlist, I needed no encouragement to get stuck in.The story is mostly concerned with the affairs of Collins Braithwaite, a leading proponent of the anti-psychiatry movement of the 1960s and at one point known as ""Britain's most dangerous man."" At the beginning, the author tells us that he has come into the possession of several notebooks written by a former patient of Braithwaite's, who believes that he was the leading cause of her sister's suicide. The book then splits into two separate narratives. One gives us a biography of Braithwaite - his troubled upbringing, his study of psychology, his hellraising ways. The second storyline looks at the nameless narrator's attempts to investigate her sister's death. She becomes a patient of Braithwaite's under a false name, Rebecca Smyth. She exaggerates Rebecca's fragile emotional state, in the hopes that he will continue to treat her, and she in turn can learn more about him. But she begins to enjoy this alter-ego a little too much, and it threatens to take over her whole life.Once again, Mcrae Burnet takes pleasure in blurring the lines between fact and fiction. I had to do a quick Google to verify that Braithwaite was not in fact a real person, so convincing was his description. But I must admit that I didn't enjoy this book as much as the author's previous efforts. Not all of the story's mysteries were satisfactorily concluded, in my opinion. The biographical sections about Braithwaite were a little dry and pedestrian, for my tastes. Rebecca's descent into madness became harder to fathom and my interest waned. As I turned the last page, I wondered about the point of it all.

I did not know that one of my friends and a family member would die of this virus. I did not know that my relationship with my daughters would change in ways I could never have anticipated. I did not know that my entire life would become something new.""Covid was always going to rear its head in the books we read, sooner rather than later. I didn't expect Elizabeth Strout to be one of the first to cover the subject but she manages to tie it into the Lucy Barton series with trademark insight and sensitivity.At the start of this story, Lucy is living in her New York apartment and about to go on another book tour. When the coronavirus shows up, she is inclined towards sticking her head in the sand and hoping it blows over, like most people. But her first husband William has other ideas. He realises that they need to get out of the city and invites her to stay in a house he has rented on the Maine coast. Reluctantly she agrees, and when the horrors of the pandemic are relayed on the daily news, she is relieved to have followed his advice. The slower pace of life takes some getting used to, but she makes friends, and finds somebody she can really open up to in her new neighbour, Bob Burgess. And her relationship with William, now platonic, show signs into developing into something more. Though worry is never far from her mind, and her difficult childhood still comes back to haunt her, Lucy finds herself adapting to this unpredictable new existence in her own way.I can understand if people wouldn't want to read a story with Covid at its core - we've all had enough of hearing about it. But Elizabeth Strout has a way of examining the pandemic that makes it worthwhile - she describes the human spirit that triumphs over adversity, the families and communities that come together when such a tragedy strikes. She's not afraid to delve into the fear and anxiety that many people had when the news broke. Lucy is just as confused and as helpless as the rest of us were, and I found it reassuring to read about a character that experienced the same doubts that I had. I also liked how this novel ties in with other stories in the Strout multiverse, with the likes of Olive Kitteridge and the Burgess boys making appearances that fans of her work will get a kick out of. All in all, it's another satisfying and absorbing episode of the Lucy Barton narrative - I hope we don't have to wait too long for the next one.Favourite Quotes:""Who knows why people are different?

And in the ice were small trees stuck there and twigs, this is the only way I can describe it, as though the world had become a different landscape and I had to make it through each day without knowing when it would stop, and it seemed it would not stop, and so I felt a great uneasiness.""""It hurt my heart with a heaviness as though a damp and dirty dishcloth lay across it.""""I got up quietly and went downstairs. And I kept thinking about this. I thought: For one hour that day outside of Chicago, I had felt my childhood humiliation so deeply again. And what if I had continued to feel that my entire life, what if all the jobs I had taken in my life were not enough to really make a living, what if I felt looked down upon all the time by the wealthier people in this country, who made fun of my religion and my guns. I did not have religion and I did not have guns, but I suddenly felt that I saw what these people were feeling; they were like my sister, Vicky, and I understood them.

They campaigned together for the release of Ruth Wyner and John Brock: homeless shelter proprietors who were incarcerated when drug-dealing had been unknowingly carried out on their premises. The two men became friends and agreed that Alexander should write Stuart's life story.The book has two timelines running through it. Some chapters occur in the present, where Stuart is doing his best to keep things on the straight and narrow. He has been given a small flat to live in and scrawls in a diary to keep track of the various activities he has planned. But it is clear he is suffering from poor mental health. He is scattered, forgetful and prone to bouts of rage. He also comments on the book Masters is writing and points out mistakes in it, lending the biography a very meta feel.The second timeline examines Stuart's history in reverse. We learn about his life on the streets - the alcohol and drug addiction, the many fights that he got into, the injuries he sustained. We find out about his time in prison and what he had to do to survive there. The story goes all the way back to his childhood and we discover that Stuart wasn't always like this. He battled with muscular dystrophy, which marked him out as different in school, but he was mostly a happy-go-lucky boy. However, it also delves into the horrendous abuse Stuart experienced at this age, and this goes a long way to explaining the problems he struggled with in later life.What a sad and tragic tale this is. It taught me more about the plight of homelessness that anything I've ever watched or read. I learned that it's not enough to give affected people a house to live in. They often have deep-seated psychological issues that need to be addressed if they are to have any hope of improving their lifestyle. Stuart was a complex character - an intelligent and often funny individual on the one hand, but somebody who could flip at the drop of a hat and carry out some despicable acts. He was an impulsive, restless kind of guy who had been beaten down by life, yet found a way to carry on. He deserved to have his story told, and to be remembered.

It begins with Bonds, a novel by Harold Vanner, which describes the life of Benjamin Rask, a reclusive man who makes his fortune on Wall Street in the 1920s. Rask marries an intelligent girl named Helen whose mental health eventually begins to unravel, ending up in a Swiss institute in her attempts to get better. The next section consists of an unfinished memoir by a financier named Andrew Bevel, whose life shares many parallels with the aforementioned Rask. The third part of Trust is what ties the whole novel together. It's told by Ida Partenza, a journalist who is hired by Bevel. Greatly irritated by Vanner's book, which he believes is a fictionalization and exaggeration of his own life, he charges Ida with writing the real story of his fortune, and marriage to Mildred, in order to set the record straight. The final section of Trust is Mildred's diary from her time in hospital, found by Ida many years later, which contains some shocking secrets.I was a big fan of Hernan Diaz's first novel so I was always going to read his next work. With Trust he demonstrates his versatility and the breadth of his imagination - it's a completely different kind of story to his debut, both in terms of subject matter and the way in which it is told. The latter is what really wowed me - each part of the novel has its own unique, authentic voice. Bevel's attempt at a memoir is so drab and unimaginative, echoing his cold, robotic personality. Mildred's journal is fragmented and jumbled, but there are flashes of her sharp intelligence. Vanner's tale of two idiosyncratic people who realise they are perfect for one another really drew me in. I must admit there were parts of Ida's recollection I didn't find that interesting, particularly regarding her father's politics and boyfriend trouble, but her working relationship with Bevel was quite fascinating.

It examines themes such as mortality and failure with such nuance and insight. However, I also enjoyed some of the lesser-known tales in this anthology. An Encounter tells of two young boys who decide to give school a miss for the day. Their adventure starts brightly but ends up turning sour. It's an effective, unsettling account of a loss of innocence. And A Painful Case describes a solitary, predictable man, who finds love against the odds and then loses it. When he receives tragic news some years later, he reacts in a most surprising manner.Living in Dublin myself, I took great pleasure in recognising the street names immortalized in these stories, and imagining the characters walking through them over a hundred years ago.

I truly expected to like it, seeing as I was such a fan of Steve Toltz's sparkling debut. But Quicksand was a slog to be honest, and I was relieved to finish it.The story revolves around a friendship between two young Australian men. Liam, the narrator of the first half, is a policeman who writes in his spare time. His pal Aldo, who he has known since school, is a force of nature. Aldo has tried every get-rich quick scheme and hare-brained business idea in the book, and they have all failed. Disaster always seems to follow him around. He's now penniless, confined to a wheelchair and missing Stella, his soulmate. Over the years he has been accused of sexual assault and murder, though his best friend has always stuck by him. And struggling for inspiration as a novelist, Liam decides to write Aldo's life story.Aldo is by far the dominant figure in the book. He's what you might call a lateral thinker, and tends to go off on crazy tangents, ranting about the problems he sees in the world. Enjoyment of the story will depend on your tolerance for his pontifications, and I'm afraid I quickly grew tired of them. I would also question Toltz's attempts to divine humour from some pretty dark subjects. The first half of the novel held my attention at least, but the second half, narrated by Aldo, really tested my patience.

It begins in 1917, where Grainier and some of his colleagues are attempting to throw a Chinese fellow off of the bridge they are constructing. The man, suspected of stealing, escapes and places a curse on his assailants. Grainier is troubled by this and believes that something bad will happen to him. Unsure of his true origins, Grainier was an orphan and raised by a family in Idaho. He's thirty-two when the book begins, married to Gladys, with a four-month-old daughter, Kate. He spends long periods away from them due to the nature of his work and misses them terribly. And one summer he comes home from working on the Robinson Gorge bridge to find out that the Chinese man's curse may have struck after all.This is my first time reading Denis Johnson and I'm sure it won't be my last. The story succeeds as a colourful portrait of America in the 20th century - Grainier sees sweeping changes in the way of life as the years roll by, though he tries his best to resist them. It's also a moving depiction of a lonely man, who finds it difficult to connect, and the way grief takes hold of a person. It's one of those rare occasions where I felt a book was too short - I needed more to get my teeth into here. But it serves as neat introduction to a writer I've heard of such high esteem.

For the uninitiated, it was a UK-based pop music magazine, published fortnightly, that I count myself lucky to remember Smash Hits of the late 1980s. For the uninitiated, it was a UK-based pop music magazine, published fortnightly, that contained news, song lyrics and interviews with all the latest chart-topping artists. But it was its tone that made it so special - it was clever, irreverent and had an anarchic sense of humour. Its writers were as likely to ask popstars whether they had ever grown parsnips out of a gumboot as about their new album, and this approach often coaxed them into revealing things they would never normally mention (or else hang up the phone).Sylvia Patterson was one of those writers, and this is her memoir, recalling her colourful career as a music journalist. After Smash Hits, she went on to write for several other notable publications, like the NME and Q. She has interviewed everybody over the intervening decades - Prince, Madonna, Britney Spears, Eminem - you name it. And she has plenty of dirt to dish, which makes it a very juicy read.She's also extremely funny, with a fine line in self-deprecating humour. I cringed at her story about Simply Red's Mick Hucknall, stalking his hotel to hand over a printed copy of her interview with him, in the hopes that he might fall in love with her. I think I'd be too embarrassed to reveal something like that but she makes it sound so amusing. Her memory of listening to Liam Gallagher of Oasis talking to a friend in her sitting room as she cleaned vomit out of her hair in the bathroom above made me laugh out loud.Patterson has also gone through a lot of turmoil in her personal life, which she talks about very candidly. A self-destructive tendency when it came to drugs and booze didn't help things, breaking her arm so badly on one bender that there was a worry it might have to be amputated. Her family situation was troubled, mostly stemming from her mother's alcoholism. And her own struggles to conceive, resulting in several miscarriages, are heartbreaking to read about.Patterson writes so brilliantly about everything, from having a bedtime story read to her by Jarvis Cocker, to Johnny Cash admiring her shoes, to spending the night at Spike Milligan's house. She has had an amazing career, and it's all down to her journalistic skills, but also her incredible ability to engage with interviewees, sparring with them in the hopes that they might open up. More often than not, they did. The later chapters rail against how anodyne music journalism has become in recent years due to the internet, with artists afraid to say anything that might be the least bit controversial, for fear that it might explode on social media. She has a fair point, and it makes me pine for the more innocent days of Smash Hits. I'm not sure I'd like to share a flat with her, but Sylvia Patterson is one hell of a writer, and this hilarious, surprisingly moving memoir was an absolute joy to read.Favourite Quotes:""Much like being in a fantastic new band, surely, having a favourite new band is one of life’s most intoxicating thrills, a prismatic explosion of hitherto dormant energy channelled from the atmosphere directly into your soul; an atomic collision promising unknowable new possibilities of sonic beguilement, lyrical connection, dancing upside down on a dance floor with your greatest friends and talking synapse- shredded cobblers ’til three days hence at dawn.""""working for the NME from ’94 onwards meant being paid the equivalent of a ten- year- old Dickensian urchin lodged down a tin mine in 1837.""""The Internet had changed everything, not only wrecking the mags’ already tenuous claim to ‘exclusivity’ but creating in the celebs a default position of paranoia as all public figures became aware, for the first time, any lone journo’s microphone was actually a radioactive global megaphone just one careless (interesting) quip away from a hollering tabloid headline.""...more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,"Jun 28, 2022","Jul 03, 2022","Jun 28, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/30074210-i-m-not-with-the-band

There is usually such a variety of voices - not all of them will appeal to every reader, but there should be at least something to cater for every taste. And Being Various is no exception to this rule, the sixth Faber volume of Irish writers.It's compiled by Lucy Caldwell, a practitioner of the short format herself, and one of considerable renown. She hails from Belfast, and decided to assemble this selection of tales written after the Good Friday Agreement, the most seismic event in modern Irish history.And to my mind, it starts off with one of the weakest stories (Yan Ge's endeavour), though it seems my opinion on that is in the minority. But the quality soon picks up with strong efforts from the likes of Sally Rooney and Kevin Barry. However, my favourites came from names that are perhaps less-heralded. Transactions, by Sheila Purdy, tells of a woman who is woken at night to the news of her brother in hospital, and the unsettling way in which she may have contributed to his condition. Jack's Return Home, by Adrian McKinty, is about a girl who travels back to Belfast for her father's funeral, and finds herself dragged into the family business of criminality, despite her previous efforts to escape. Strongest of all was Stuart Neville's Echoes, a haunting tale of a young boy and the ghost of a sibling that a grief-stricken household can never let go of. It all serves as an excellent introduction to the most notable voices in modern Irish fiction. Though there were some stories I was glad to see the back of, the quality of other tales really shone through.

The author Eugene McCabe was more famous for his plays, and this is the only novel he ever wrote. However, it has been highly praised by the likes of Hilary Mantel and John Banville, and has been taught on the Irish secondary school syllabus of late.The story is set in 1883 in the county of Fermanagh. Billy Winters is a wealthy Protestant landowner, living on a large farm with his daughter Beth. He learned that Beth was not his, shortly after he married her mother Catherine, who died tragically in an accident. Today is Beth's 25th birthday and tensions between herself and her father are threatening to spill over. What he doesn't know is that she has been seeing one his tenants: Liam Ward, a man of questionable repute. Rumour has it that Ward was somehow involved the killing of the British Viceroy in Dublin, an event that shocked the nation. Indeed, Billy has been visited by government agents in relation to Ward. But Beth has a secret plan to abscond with her beau, and get one over on her old man in the process.The story is set against the growing agitation between Catholics and Protestants, when Charles Stewart Parnell was beginning to stir his countrymen in efforts to rise against their oppressors. Billy remarks that his people have been in this country have been in this country for over 300 years, and wonders if they will ever be accepted. Along with the political intrigue, there is genuine suspense, as we wonder if Beth's daring scheme will bear fruit. It all builds to an exciting, unpredictable climax.

I'd like to learn more about this John Wilkes Booth fella."" But that's not what this book is about at all. It's more concerned with the wider Booth family and their circumstances in the lead-up to the murder of Abraham Lincoln.We learn far more about the siblings of the infamous assassin than we do about the man himself. Rosalia is the eldest daughter, affected by scoliosis, single all her life. Edwin intends to become an actor, just like his father Junius, and he has plenty of ability, though the family addiction to alcohol has been passed to him. Younger sister Asia is beautiful but prickly. All of the Booths become anxious about the schemings of John. He's also an actor, a person who constantly strives for attention. And his opinions on the topic of slavery alarm his brothers and sisters. He makes bold claims and his sympathies with the South go against the liberal leanings of his family. But none of them ever truly believe that he is willing to act upon them.This is a long, slow-moving tale, bogged down in lots of unnecessary information. John is a peripheral figure in the book, and we never really get underneath his wild exterior to see what makes him tick. Of course his unstable home life must have had a profound effect on him, not helped by the malign influence of his troubled father. But as for what his going through his mind in the lead up to the assassination, it is not explored by this story in a satisfactory way. I didn't find his siblings all that interesting, apart from Edwin, who led quite a colourful life. And the crime itself happens so late in the book - we only get a glimpse of the shock and dismay that it thrusts upon the Booths. I found this a frustrating read overall. It's understandable that the author does not want to glorify the ideals and motivations of a murderer. But we end up with far more information about his family than we need, and learn precious little about of the personality of this historical figure, who is notable for all the wrong reasons.

Italy is starting to regroup after the Second World War, and Elena's poverty-stricken neighborhood begins to show signs of recovery and growth.

Harriet is taken away to live with her father Gust and his new partner Susanna. Meanwhile Frida is confined to a reform school, where she will learn how to be a good mother, along with some other offenders. After a year of instruction and supervision, and practicing her skills on robot children, she will be inspected. If she passes, she'll get Harriet back. If she fails, however, her parental rights will be terminated.This is a speculative story in the style of Margaret Atwood, but not as good.

The incarceration occurs at a formative stage of Harriet's development and she barely recognises her mother at the end of it all.

I was very impressed with its atmospheric tale of murder on the Scottish Highlands. So I told myself that I must investigate his back catalogue at some point.This novel was his debut and it revolves around two very different characters. Manfred Baumann is a bank manager who eats lunch every day at Restaurant de la Cloche, in the small French town of Saint-Louis. He's a loner, a quiet individual with few friends. His parents passed away when he was younger and he was brought up by his grandparents. The staff at Restaurant de la Cloche know him well at this point, though they have little interaction with him. However he is quite taken with Adèle, a young waitress. He attempts to engage her in conversation one evening and she responds politely to him. And then she disappears, with Manfred being one of the last people to have seen her. Inspector Georges Gorski is assigned to the case. He's still haunted by the murder of a teenage girl in the town several years ago, a crime he was unable to solve. And he can't shake the notion that Adèle's disappearance might be connected. His investigation leads him to Manfred, who seems to know more than he is letting on.There is a fascinating mystery at the heart of this story, and it kept me enthralled. Just what really happened to Adèle, and how involved was Manfred? I changed my mind a few times, but he has some secrets in his past that influenced my decision. Macrae Burnet does an excellent job of imagining out the motivations of the protagonists. Manfred overthinks everything - he is incredibly anxious and self-conscious, every little interaction he experiences is analyzed endlessly. Meanwhile Gorski is a dogged investigator, a man who trusts his instinct as much as the detective process (maybe a little too much). The ending might not be to everybody's tastes, but I thought it worked well, and made me re-evaluate assumptions I had made of both characters.

He treats his wife Lucia (also an artist) like dirt, even carrying on an affair while she was suffering from cancer. He belittles her at every opportunity, even though whisper it, she has more talent him. Daughter Leah is his right-hand woman, an attack dog who lashes out at anybody that even thinks about criticizing her precious Papa. Her sister Jess is more skeptical, even though she stays quiet about it, and has exiled herself in Edinburgh to escape the family strife. And Ray's stepson Patrick is a bag of nerves, daring to dream about leaving for a job in a pub kitchen but too afraid to reveal his intentions. Family and friends all gather for Ray's big show and the pressure starts to take its toll on the long-suffering Hanrahans.The book is billed as a comedy but I'm afraid I didn't find it funny.

It's co-edited by Kim Gordon from Sonic Youth and Sinead Gleeson, the Irish critic and author of Constellations, a terrific anthology of her own non-fiction.The book gets off to a great start with Anne Enright's appreciation of the avant-garde composer Laurie Anderson. She talks about finally having the chance to meet her hero during an event the Irish Arts Centre in New York. All of the things Enright has wanted to say for years are racing through her head - she is bursting to explain how much Anderson's work has meant to her. And she ends up completely tongued-tied, unable to get anything remotely intelligible out. We've all been there, haven't we? It's a delightful take on the highs and lows of fandom. Many of the pieces look at music as a form of identity in some way. Maggie Nelson writes beautifully about the American artist Lhasa de Sela, ""my first and only truly bohemian friend."" They were pals at school when a rudderless de Sela found her calling as a singer, later going on to create extraordinary albums that won multiple awards. She died of breast cancer aged 37 and though they had drifted apart in later years, Nelson looks back on their friendship with fond memories.The standout essay for me comes from Leslie Jamison, and it's constructed around eight different mix-tapes that she has listened to at various times in her life. At one point she comes to realise that her taste in music has been shaped by her efforts to win the approval of men, ""that I'd spent much of my life trying to gain the affirmation of men by loving what they loved, and by creating myself as a person they would see as worthy of love."" But when lockdown arrives, she dances to her own playlists at home with her young daughter, and begins to write a new story for herself.There were several other pieces I enjoyed, such as Sub Pop CEO Megan Jasper's memories of answering the phones when she joined the label as a receptionist at the height of grunge, and Gleeson's own account of her admiration for electronic trailblazer Wendy Carlos. It's a wide-ranging, thought-provoking collection of writing that shines a light on some of the female stories that have been marginalized through the history of music.

I was eager to Adam Haslett's Imagine Me Gone is one of my favourite novels of recent years, a tender and beautifully told account of mental illness. I was eager to read more of his work and when I saw his first book in a charity shop the other day, I decided to give it a shot.The story opens in the Middle East, 1988. Doug Fanning, a young man not long out of high school, is aboard a US battleship when he becomes involved in a military operation that goes disastrously wrong. The narrative then jumps forwards several years. Doug is now a very successful executive in an investment bank based out of Boston. He decides to reward himself by building a mansion in Finden, the commuter town where his mother used to clean the houses of wealthy families. What he hasn't bargained for is the stubborn intentions of his new neighbour, Charlotte Graves. She believes her family has a claim to the land that his decadent palace now stands on, and she's willing to go to court to prove it. Meanwhile, Nate, a young history student that she tutors, acts upon his crush for the handsome Doug, and soon finds himself a pawn in their intricate game of legal manoeuvres.The book is garlanded with praise from the likes of Kate Atkinson and Jonathan Franzen. There was a bit too much financial talk in it for my liking - I don't need to know all the ins and outs of Wall Street trading, thank you very much. I'm more interested in the human aspect of the story. Doug remains pretty inscrutable - he doesn't seem to like many people, including himself. Charlotte's demise though, I found quite moving - a hyperintelligent, curious individual who lost the only person she truly cared about, and never really recovered from it. I think Haslett tries to do too many things here - it's a state of the nation novel, addressing capitalism, gender politics, race and environmental concerns among its multiple themes.

It was on a Friday night slot on Irish television called The Last Picture Show, in which the host Brian Reddin would provide an intro to a classic movie, and then let it play in all its glory. The Mel Brooks western was one of those and it bowled me over. Not only was it flat-out hilarious, it did things I didn't know a film a could do, like the famous fight scene where the Sheriff and the Waco Kid are pursued through the Warner Brothers backlot. So I always wanted to learn more about the comedy genius behind it all.In this lively autobiography, Brooks takes us on a journey through his life and career, starting off with his childhood in New York City. His father died when he was two, and the family lived in tenement housing, but he has happy memories of his upbringing. He was the youngest of four brothers, all of whom served in the military during World War II. When he was nine, his Uncle Joe brought him to see a Broadway musical, and from that moment on he knew his future lay in showbusiness. Brooks started off working as an entertainer at resorts in the Borscht Belt, but eventually began writing jokes for TV, earning himself a steady job on Your Show of Shows. In the 60s he created the hit series Get Smart, and that gave him the clout to start his film career.And this is a fascinating aspect of the book, as Brooks takes us behind the scenes of his most famous movies. He talks about his struggle to get The Producers made, and his joy at the rapturous s it received. He speaks glowingly of the actors he worked with, like Gene Wilder, who became a good friend and went on to star in Young Frankenstein and Blazing Saddles. And he also talks candidly about his efforts as a producer, making acclaimed films like The Elephant Man, and having to take his name off the credits in case the audience might think they were about to see a madcap comedy.But I think the thing I liked most about the book was the way he spoke about his wife Anne Bancroft. The moment Brooks saw her rehearsing on stage he knew she was the one, and when she had finished singing, he stood up and shouted out: ""Anne Bancroft! I love you!"" She laughed and he was amazed that she already knew who he was, having heard the comedy album he recorded with his best pal Carl Reiner. He found ways to show up to whatever party or restaurant she was going to. She got wise to this and jokingly accused him of stalking her, daring him to ask her on a date, which he did. And that was the beginning of a beautiful partnership. Bancroft once spoke about their marriage on the Today Show: ""When I hear his key in the lock at night my heart starts to beat faster. I'm just so happy he's coming home. We have so much fun."" Talk about relationship goals!So why only three stars? Well I think Brooks has a tendency to gloss over some the low points of his career and it's all a rather rose-tinted view. He talks up notorious flops like Life Stinks and Solarbabies, conveniently ignoring the critical mauling and box-office disasters that they were. He's not afraid to blow his own trumpet either, as he goes on about the success of The Producers on Broadway. And he often quotes favourite lines from his movies, which takes up large sections of the book. I'm looking for insight Mel, not half of a script I already know! Maybe I'm being picky, but I just get the sense he's not telling us the whole story. I'm happy to read all about the good times, but I want to know about the struggles too. But it's an enjoyable read overall - Brooks comes across as a likeable, funny guy, and fans will be entertained by his colourful anecdotes....more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"Apr 05, 2022","Apr 10, 2022","Apr 05, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58537351-all-about-me-my-remarkable-life-in-show-business

The best of them, Calm With Horses, stopped me in my tracks and was later turned into an acclaimed film. So I was more than keen to read another selection of tales from such a gifted author.The majority of the stories in Homesickness are also set in County Mayo, where Barrett grew up. With a keen eye for the uncommon beauty of the rural landscape, he describes ""cows sitting like shelves of rock in the middle of the fields, absorbing the last of the day's declining rays."" But he also has a neat way of conjuring scenes that are less aesthetically pleasing. In one story set in an unnamed city, he imagines ""the dangling lobe of a used condom snagged on the branch of a bush like a dismal festive decoration.""The subjects of these tales are often disaffected and rudderless. In The 10, a young man works in his father's car dealership after having his dreams of becoming a professional footballer crushed. The protagonist of Anhedonia, Here I Come is a struggling poet who creates pornographic cartoons of Disney characters as a way of supplementing his income. Much like Young Skins, there is plenty of doom and gloom in this book. The one exception is The Alps, a comic depiction of a typical night in a country pub.Hailing from rural Ireland myself, I recognised many of the characters in this collection. Barrett displays a deep understanding of what makes these ordinary lives tick - his sentences are lyrical and his dialogue sparkles. But if I'm being totally honest, I thought Homesickness lacked some of the magic of his debut. There was no standout story for me here, nothing blew me away this time.

Throughout her life it has been the one constant - she's had to put up with her parents' divorce, creepy stepsiblings and grief among other problems. She's married to Peter, an English gentleman, and they have three kids. But she has always had feelings for Jonas, a childhood friend who also spends his summers in the same location. When they finally consummate their repressed longing for one another at the start of the story, Elle realises she has a huge decision to make.

The unnamed narrator is a young black British woman who works in finance. She puts up with sexism every day at her job, and jealousy when she is handed a promotion. She's aware that her improved position is being used as proof of the company's positive approach to diversity. She dates a man from a wealthy family, and a colleague predicts that he will propose at a party on their opulent estate, but she knows that his mother is hoping that it's just a fling. And when her oncologist informs her that she has breast cancer, he is shocked when she is reluctant to undergo treatment.This is accomplished in just over a hundred pages. It's all very clever - the writing is bold and perceptive. The narrator seems quite detached from events - it feels like life is happening to her, rather than her taking an active part in it. Her account unfolds in short, piercing fragments - a collection of ruminations. There isn't a whole lot of plot, and I wasn't really moved by it. However, there is plenty of intelligent insight on subjects like class and race. Maybe the story could do with fleshing out a bit more, but Assembly marks Natasha Brown out as an exciting new talent.Favourite Quotes:""Back at the office, Lou’s not in yet.

The story is told by a man who has gone missing, through a series of audio files that were found on his iPhone. Steven Smith has just been released from prison. He's lonely, aimless, and his grown-up son wants nothing to do with him. He becomes obsessed with the memory of Miss Iles, his former teacher who disappeared on a school trip 40 years ago. The trip was prompted by a children's book Steven found, written by a once popular author, Edith Twyford. Miss Iles believed that Twyford inserted codes into her stories, which would lead to hidden treasure. In the present, Steven investigates what really happened to his teacher on that fateful day. And with the help of Lucy, a local librarian, he looks into the theory that there actually were secrets hidden in the pages of Twyford's books.I loved the innovative way in which this compelling story was told. The audio files have been transcribed using computer software, which occasionally gets words wrong (""mustard"" for ""must have"" etc) and this adds to the authenticity. Steven is a narrator who elicits sympathy, despite his criminal past. He's at a loose end and the whole Twyford code hypothesis (the out of fashion author obviously based on Enid Blyton) gives him a sense of purpose. And the story poses enough questions to keep the reader guessing. How does Steven end up missing? What really happened to Miss Iles? And could the crazy idea of secret codes inside a children's book actually be true? However, at a certain point, I'm afraid the narrative becomes over-complicated.

As part of his job, he speculates on what planets outside the Solar System might look like, and shares his ideas of these worlds with his 9-year-old son Robin, as a kind of bedtime story. Robin is going through a hard time - he's on the spectrum, though his condition has never been definitively diagnosed. He's also grieving the loss of his mother Alyssa, who died in an accident two years ago. Theo struggles to look after his son's special needs. He takes him camping which helps to ease his mind, but as soon as Robin gets back into the routine of school, old problems resurface. Salvation arrives in the form of a neurological experiment, which allows the boy to recalibrate his emotions based on a recording of his mother's brain activity. This proves a big success, but also becomes a media sensation, and Theo & Robin end up with a new set of problems to deal with.I was a fan of Powers' previous novel, The Overstory, so I had been looking forward to this one. I thought it started off brightly - I was engaged in the hardship facing father and son, and felt sympathy for their plight. But as the story progressed, I became less enamored, and most of my bugbears were to do with Robin. As the treatment takes hold, he turns into a kind of ecological savant. Some of the stuff he came out with made me cringe, his sentimentality about the natural world seemed over the top. And the overall message of the book felt so preachy, a heavy-handed attempt to press home the anxieties of the climate crisis. While The Overstory had its flaws, I thought it addressed environmental concerns with a much subtler approach - its characters were well-rounded and the story was compelling.

But it does give an intriguing glimpse of how it feels to report from the White House.

Back in 2015, A Little Life was the book of the moment, and it proved quite divisive - it seemed everybody had an opinion on it. Though the trauma it described was a turnoff for many readers, I was a fan, and eager to get my hands on the author's follow-up, To Paradise. But as I turned the opening pages, I thought to myself, in what way is Hanya Yanagihara going to torture these poor souls that lie within?To Paradise is split into three separate stories, taking place in alternate versions of America. The first is set in 1893, and David Bingham is the protagonist, a gay man from a wealthy family, who must decide whether to marry another affluent, older gentleman, or to follow his heart and take up with a struggling music teacher. The second section is set in 1993, and a different David Bingham, a paralegal from Hawaii, attends a party thrown by his lover, in order to say goodbye to a close friend dying of AIDS. And the final story occurs in 2093, where a series of pandemics have ravaged the country, and society has become a totalitarian one in which homosexuality has been outlawed. A woman named Charlie Bingham, who has survived one of the viruses, struggles to make sense of the world, in a loveless marriage to a man she barely even knows.There are links between the three tales, some of them more obvious than others. A house in Washington Square, New York features in all of them, and it's fascinating to watch its purpose change over the years. Gay men are characters in each story, at times free to live as they wish, in other periods oppressed. Arranged marriages crop up a few times, as does Hawaii and sickness. I think the most common theme of all is that the protagonists are each seeking love, in the face of adversity and often a sense of confusion on their own part.I loved the first story - the period detail and hints at an alternative history kept me intrigued, but the main character's romantic dilemma was what really compelled me. The middle tale I was most indifferent too, especially the long digressions in Hawaii. The last story piqued my interest again, its dystopian world and cryptic references to past atrocities demanding my attention.By the end, I was left wondering what it all meant. Why do characters with the same name appear in each tale? Why was one the stories left hanging in mid-air with no resolution? What exactly is the central message of the novel - something to do with history repeating itself, a society that doesn't learn from past mistakes? I don't know, and Yanagihara leaves us to figure it out for ourselves. But maybe that's part of the fun, putting all of the jigsaw pieces together. All I do know is that I thoroughly enjoyed reading this ambitious, complex, sprawling work of great imagination. Favorite Quotes:""He felt at times as if his life were something he was only waiting to use up, so that, at the end of each day, he would settle into bed with a sigh, knowing he had worked through a small bit more of his existence and had moved another centimeter toward its natural conclusion.""""The fact that he had not experienced the same kind of happiness was a source of both sorrow and concern; of late, he had been beginning to fear that it was not just that no one might love him but that he might be incapable of receiving such love, which seemed altogether worse.""""What he wouldn’t know until he was much older was that no one was ever free, that to know someone and to love them was to assume the task of remembering them, even if that person was still living. No one could escape that duty, and as you aged, you grew to crave that responsibility even as you sometimes resented it, that knowledge that your life was inextricable from another’s, that a person marked their existence in part by their association with you.""""When I was an undergraduate, a professor of mine had said there were two types of people: those who wept for the world, and those who wept for themselves. Weeping for your family, he said, was a form of weeping for yourself. “Those who congratulate themselves on their sacrifices for their families aren’t actually sacrificing at all,” he said, “because their family is an extension of their selves, and therefore a manifestation of the ego.” True selflessness, he said, meant giving of yourself to a stranger, someone whose life would never be entangled with your own.""""You forget, sometimes, how much you need to be touched. It’s not food or water or light or heat—you can go for years without it. The body doesn’t remember the sensation; it does you the kindness of allowing you to forget.""...more",Notes are private!,0,37,1,"Jan 26, 2022","Jan 30, 2022","Jan 26, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57739876-to-paradise

It captures a painful chapter of Irish history and features the kind of moral dilemma that many of us may face in our lifetime - when the moment arrives, do we have the courage to right a grave and unequivocal wrong?The story is set in the town of New Ross, shortly before the Christmas of 1985. Bill Furlong is a successful coal merchant, raising five daughters with his wife Eileen. Though he is happily married and his family bring him great joy, he remains unsettled by his childhood. His mother gave birth to him when she was only a teenager, and he never knew his father. Bill understands that it was only through the kindness of his mother's employer that he was lucky enough to receive a normal upbringing. Now, on a delivery to the local convent, feelings of discomfort surface again. Rumours abound regarding this place - that it takes in young women in trouble and treats them appallingly. When Bill sees evidence of this with his own eyes, he realises he must act, but that his decision will have great consequences.Claire Keegan tackles one of Ireland's great shames, the Magdalene Laundries, in this sensitive and moving tale. It's a simple story really, about a good man trying his best to do the right thing. But it's also about the bravery required to take a stand against injustice, when it's far easier to keep your head down and pretend that you didn't notice. I found it absolutely heartbreaking at times, especially the scene where (view spoiler)[Bill finds the girl in the coal shed) (hide spoiler)]. And I loved the ending: Bill knows full well what's in store for him, and so do we - there is no need to fill in the blanks. Small Things Like These is a little marvel, I cannot recommend it enough.Favourite Quotes:""Before long, he caught a hold of himself and concluded that nothing ever did happen again; to each was given days and chances which wouldn’t come back around. And wasn’t it sweet to be where you were and let it remind you of the past for once, despite the upset instead of always looking on into the mechanics of the days and the trouble ahead, which might never come.""""As they carried on along and met more people Furlong did and did not know, he found himself asking was there any point in being alive without helping one another? Was it possible to carry on along through all the years, the decades, through an entire life, without once being brave enough to go against what was there and yet call yourself a Christian, and face yourself in the mirror?""""The worst was yet to come, he knew.

The problem is, she's already going out with a pal of his. Things remain platonic and they become entangled in one another's lives, spending long nights bonding over a love of art and music. They also end up collaborating on a photography project to document the city's black population. Eventually, the connection turns romantic - they're no longer able to contain themselves, even though they're both worried that it might impact on their friendship. She returns to university in Dublin, and though distance complicates things, it also makes the heart grow fonder. But he is becoming increasingly troubled by the violence he sees in London's black neighborhoods, and his inability to express his sadness puts a strain on their relationship.This is a lyrical and beautifully observed debut from Caleb Azumah Nelson - I'm not at all surprised that it won the Costa First Novel Award. In elegant, poetic prose, he captures what it feels like to meet your soulmate and fall in dizzying love. His portrayal of life as a black man in modern London is startling - the systemic racism having a negative long-term effect on our narrator, one that he is sadly unable to articulate to his partner. The tension he experiences from just trying to make it through the day is exhausting, yet he believes that he needs to present a brave face at all times, as vulnerability is discouraged. I really felt his anguish and wished that he could share his burden. With a confident and exciting new voice, Open Water is a powerful, heartfelt debut.Favourite Quotes: ""You gazed at each other then with the same open-eyed wonder that keeps startling you at various intervals since you met. The two of you, like headphone wires tangling, caught up in this something. A happy accident. A messy miracle.""""You feel her turn beside you. You wonder how long this moment could stretch for, and how much it could contain: you, her, the soft rush of cars speeding in the darkness, the gaze, seeing each other here, her heartbeat near audible, before she says, ‘I love you, you know?’ She has swum out into open water, and it is not long before you join her. You take but a moment before saying, ‘I love you too.’""""You feel you have never been strangers. You do not want to leave each other, because to leave is to have the thing die in its current form and there is something, something in this that neither is willing to relinquish.""""You came here to tell the truth. That you are scared and heavy. That sometimes this weight is too heavy. The ache in your chest fills, bulbous and stretched, and though you wish it would, the ache will not burst.""""This is not an overstatement. You are dying. You young boys are dying.

And he certainly lives up to that title in this memoir - the Foo Fighters frontman makes great company, telling many colourful stories about his time in the music business, but never forgetting where he came from, or the people who helped him along the way.Grohl was raised in Springfield, Virginia, mostly by his mother, a teacher. He didn't really see eye to eye with his Dad, a Republican political consultant. When cousin Tracey introduced Grohl to punk rock at age 13, his eyes were opened, and he knew what he wanted to do with his life. He began to dedicate his free time to learning the drums, and somehow ended up wangling an audition for Scream, one of his favourite bands. He nailed it and even though he was only 17 at the time, was asked to join the group as a full-time member. He toured extensively with Scream, though they remained an underground band, never attaining mainstream popularity. Everything changed when he agreed to join Nirvana, who of course became the biggest music sensation on the planet. Kurt Cobain's death had a major effect on Grohl, but he eventually pulled himself together to establish the Foo Fighters. This venture has been a huge success, and he spends his days touring the world with the band and raising three daughters with his wife Jordyn.Grohl comes off as such a likeable guy in the book. He has managed to stay humble somehow, even though he can call Paul McCartney a friend and has performed for Presidents. He's got some great stories of life on the road, and I think I enjoyed his recollections of Scream the most, even though I knew little about the band. Something about the tireless effort they made, all the crap venues they played, the dirty floors they slept on - it seemed like a magical journey even though they never really made it. He speaks of that time very fondly and I'm sure he wouldn't change a thing.If I have a criticism of the book, it's what has been left out. It was a bit light on Nirvana for my taste. I know Grohl wasn't in the band all that long, but I would love to have read a few more Cobain anecdotes or to discover what it was really like to record Nevermind, arguably the most important album of the 90s. He also barely mentions his first marriage, which I found a little odd. Maybe it's a wound he would rather not pick at, but I would like to hear his whole story, not just the happy memories.All in all though, it's a pleasure to read. Grohl is a witty, spirited narrator and it's no mystery why he has managed to stay at the top for so long - his enthusiasm is infectious.

In fact, if it was the plot of Hollywood movie I would dismiss it as being too far-fetched.The subject of this startling true crime investigation is a Frenchman, Jean-Claude Romand. In 1993, he killed his wife and two young children, then drove to his parents' house and murdered them too. Afterwards he returned home, took a bunch of sleeping pills and set the house on fire. But he didn't die, firefighters dragged him out via a window and he recovered after a stint in hospital. Romand's neighbours were absolutely stunned. They all lived in a well-to-do area of France; this kind of thing didn't happen around here. And the Romand family seemed so happy - Jean-Claude had an important job with the WHO in Geneva, the kids were getting on well at school. However, during the subsequent trial, friends of this cold-blooded killer realised they had never truly known him at all.Emmanuel Carrère was already a notable writer at the time of the murders, and he became so fascinated with the case that he wrote to Romand, asking if he would like to tell his side of the story. The result is this book and the revelations it contains are often extraordinary. I won't say too much for fear of spoilers, but the level of deception and delusion that Romand was involved in is astonishing. Carrère does his best to get inside his head and uncover the darkness that Romand hid from the world for so long.

With war and famine on the minds of so many citizens, it's not surprising that a religious fervour came to the fore, with people more than willing to blame bad fortune on the devil and his female recruits. AK Blakemore conjures a worthy heroine in Rebecca, a tough and thoughtful girl who is easy to root for. I found the chapters that focused on Hopkins less successful - I never fully understood his motivations or where his overbearing sense of morality came from. Still, this is a fine debut, and it brings a fascinating period of English history to life in an evocative way....more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,"Dec 07, 2021","Dec 12, 2021","Dec 07, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56993994-the-manningtree-witches

I consider myself in the former camp but I can see why he rubs some people the wrong way. Franzen said in 2018 that his next novel might be his last. But now that Crossroads is finally here, he has revealed that it's the first in a trilogy, and I'm delighted that there is more to come in this sweeping family saga.The family in question, the Hildebrands, live in smalltown Illinois. Russ is an associate pastor, driven by a crush on a widowed parishioner and a hatred of Rick Ambrose, the hip leader of the local youth group. Marion, his wife, struggles with self-loathing and is secretly attending therapy sessions in a bid to overcome her mental anguish. Clem, the eldest child, is away at college and has fallen in love for the first time, but is conflicted by a sense of duty that won't let him rest. Becky is beautiful, popular and obsessed with Tanner Mayes, an up-and-coming musician. And Perry is the boy genius with a proliferating drug problem. The story begins in the run up to Christmas 1971, where tensions in the household are threatening to boil over.Crossroads is one of those family dramas that Franzen does so well, a 600 page epic that I didn't want to end. It's sprawling but also intimate. We get so inside the heads of these characters that we feel like we're really experiencing their innermost feelings: the hidden desires that thrill and frighten them, the guilt that threatens to overwhelm them. He's particularly good at capturing the thoughts of teenagers, on the cusp of independence and beginning to find their place in the world. Russ's tale is searingly honest, a man of God consumed by human flaws of lust and envy. But I found Marion's journey the most moving of all, a woman who has felt so lost and been through such torment, doing her best to keep it together. We have a front-row seat to each individual family crisis, and it makes for gripping reading. It's all so precisely observed and full of layered, unforgettable characters.

From her ramblings we can decipher that she lived alone until a man named Eddie crossed her path and proceeded to take up residence in her home. Eddie was an unpleasant individual by her account, and though he has since moved to Canada, he has left an indelible mark on Bina. She has also gotten into some trouble with the police after becoming involved bunch of hippies, which led to her being imprisoned for a brief period.Where the novel succeeds is in the voice of Bina. Her mind is clearly addled, she continually repeats herself in her chatter and goes off on tangents that make no sense. But I'm afraid there is very little in the way of real story here, and because of this I didn't find it a very compelling read. The amount of actual plot could be written on the back of one of the receipts that Bina is so fond of. So as an experiment in capturing the twists and turns of an elderly woman's thought process, I would say that it prevails.

It begins with a brutal murder, as a gay couple are gunned down outside a wine store. Their fathers, Ike Randolph and Buddy Lee Jenkins are absolutely devastated. And both are tormented with guilt, as neither of them approved of their sons' lifestyle and now it's too late to make amends. The one thing they can do is hunt down their killers and make them pay. Ike, a respectable businessman with a violent past, is initially reluctant to return to his old ways. But with some coaxing from Buddy Lee and the pain eating him up, he eventually gives in. Their investigation directs them towards an elusive girl named Tangerine, who had a link to their sons, and a vicious biker gang carrying out the orders of a mysterious paymaster.I was a fan of S.A. Cosby's previous novel, Blacktop Wasteland, so I was eager to get my hands his latest. And I am delighted to report that it is every bit as thrilling to read. The stroke of genius is the unlikely pairing of Ike and Buddy Lee, an intense black man and a redneck who would never be friends in normal circumstances. Buddy Lee is borderline racist as the story begins, but a gradual camaraderie emerges between the two as they survive one tight scrape after another. One of the novel's strengths is the duo's dialogue, the kind of wisecracks from buddy movies that Hollywood used to make. There is also an emotional depth to the story, as the men come to terms with heartbreak and regret over failed relationships with their sons. If I have one small complaint it's to do with the violence in the book - not that I am squeamish in any way, it's just that I found the descriptions of lengthy fight scenes a bit tiresome.

And 17-year-old Marie doesn't fit in - her unusual height, plain looks and rural French accent setting her apart from more sophisticated contemporaries. Eleanor sends her away to live in a rundown abbey, much to Marie's heartbreak, as she has always held a deep admiration for her Queen. The abbey is in a sorry state, its twenty nuns starving and rudderless under the charge of a blind, scattered abbess. Marie takes over as prioress and transforms the institution, bringing in new rents, setting up a scriptorium and putting the nuns to work more suiting their abilities. She also begins to receive visions of the Virgin Mary, and these apparitions guide her ambitions for the abbey.I'm afraid I didn't get on very well with this one. The setup is intriguing, and I rooted for our hero, hoping that she would show Eleanor the error of her decision and prove her wrong. However, it becomes apparent that the Queen has no interest in poor Marie, and unfortunately that subplot never caught fire. I thought that I would find life in a medieval abbey more interesting, but it all seemed to come a bit too easy to Marie - as other ers have noted, it felt like she overcame every obstacle without breaking a sweat.

Night Shift was Stephen King's first collection of short fiction, much of which had already appeared in the likes of Penthouse and Cosmopolitan magazine throughout the seventies.Some details of these stories were already familiar to me. Children of the Corn was made into a successful movie and the original tale still retains its capacity to disturb. There are two stories related to Salem's Lot - one a prequel that goes some way to explaining the strange events in that creepy town, and the other takes place after the novel, focusing on a family that gets stranded in a snow storm. The book also contains other stories that were adapted into films, with varying degrees of success, like The Mangler, The Lawnmower Man, and Trucks (which became Maximum Overdrive).But I was even more entertained by the stories I knew nothing about. The Ledge is a suspenseful tale of a man who is offered an unusual wager as a way of saving his girlfriend's life. I Am The Doorway is one of King's first science fiction efforts, an eerie account of an astronaut who unwittingly brings something back from outer space. And Quitters, Inc tells of a businessman who learns of a sure-fire way to overcome addiction, without understanding the true cost of its method.What amazes me about the book is King's incredible imagination - so wide-ranging, so willing to peer into dark corners that most of us would flinch away from. And he has a real knack for conjuring the most menacing endings, final sentences that send a shiver up your spine long after the tale has been told. Night Shift is a terrific showcase of King's gift for the macabre, and cements his reputation as one the all-time great storytellers....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Oct 27, 2021",Nov 2021,"Oct 27, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10628.Night_Shift

The Anthropocene Reviewed is a collection of essays about various aspects of modern existence that Green has an opinion on. They could be as random as Diet Dr Pepper, Air Conditioning or Monopoly. He s each of them and gives them a rating out of five stars. But he also manages to tie everything neatly to own events in his life. For example, the Super Mario Kart piece is more about male friendship than video games - he's nostalgic about the time he spent with his childhood pals, the game giving them a reason to get together. And the Indianapolis 500 essay is less about the race itself, and more about the sense of community that it brings to his neighbourhood.Green is a sensitive guy, and in his writing, he wears his heart on his sleeve. It's a trait that serves him well in the world of YA, but there were times in this book when I thought it veered too much into sentimentality. And I grew tired of the star rating gimmick by the end. But he's also a passionate, curious individual, and I get the feeling that when he is interested in a particular subject, he goes really deep, wanting to know everything, and I like that about him.

There were things I admired about Normal People, but I also found elements of it frustrating. In the end though I gave in, as I felt like I couldn't miss out on the most talked about book of the year. And when the author of said novel is Irish, I can't help but root for her and hope that it's a big success.This story is also set in Ireland and focuses on two friends approaching the age of thirty. Alice is an acclaimed author, but somebody who has struggled with her mental health, and now lives alone in a former rectory on the west coast. Elieen stays in an apartment in Dublin city, the meagre salary she earns as an editor at a literary magazine covering her rent, with little to spare. The pair met at university and keep in touch these days via email. Alice tells her pal about Felix, a local warehouse worker whom she met on a dating app. On a whim she decides to invite him on trip to Rome, and an attraction develops into something more. Meanwhile Eileen remains confused about her relationship with Simon, an older childhood friend who is undoubtedly has feelings for her, but continues to see other women.The main criticism I have with this book is around the email format. It didn't always work for me. I found it difficult to believe that two close friends would speak so formally to one another, even if they are as intelligent and well-read as Alice and Eileen. That they would seek one another's advice on life seemed perfectly normal, but lengthy digressions about religion and philosophy were harder to swallow.The second half of the novel I found much more compelling. There is a wonderful chapter that describes the wedding of Eileen's sister, where the narrative shifts seamlessly between several characters, imagining the thoughts swirling around in their heads on the day. I thought it was the best thing in the whole book. The story also shifts up several gears when Eileen comes to visit Alice, with Simon in tow. The outspoken Felix is a source of conflict, and simmering tensions among the quartet threaten to boil over. For these characters who have been somewhat restrained up to now (apart from Felix), it's fascinating to finally see them let fly.I've heard some people say that the story's email structure put them off and I can see why, but I'm glad I persisted with it. Rooney continues to be strong on relationships - she shows a deep understanding of what makes them tick, and the pressures that can strain them. She also has some very interesting things to say about fame and celebrity culture, which is surely spoken from personal experience. In the end, I found it a more satisfying read than Rooney's previous novel. It's an intelligent and observant tale about longing and the desire to connect. I'm already intrigued to see what she follows it with.Favourite Quotes""Every day I wonder why my life has turned out this way. I can’t believe I have to tolerate these things – having articles written about me, and seeing my photograph on the internet, and reading comments about myself. When I put it like that, I think: that’s it? And so what? But the fact is, although it’s nothing, it makes me miserable, and I don’t want to live this kind of life. When I submitted the first book, I just wanted to make enough money to finish the next one. I never advertised myself as a psychologically robust person, capable of withstanding extensive public inquiries into my personality and upbringing.""""People who intentionally become famous – I mean people who, after a little taste of fame, want more and more of it – are, and I honestly believe this, deeply psychologically ill. The fact that we are exposed to these people everywhere in our culture, as if they are not only normal but attractive and enviable, indicates the extent of our disfiguring social disease. There is something wrong with them, and when we look at them and learn from them, something goes wrong with us.""""I’m always talking about care ethics and the value of human community, but in my real life I don’t take on the work of caring for anyone except myself. Who in the world relies on me for anything? No one. I can blame myself, and I do, but I also think the failure is general. People our age used to get married and have children and conduct love affairs, and now everyone is still single at thirty and lives with housemates they never see. Traditional marriage was obviously not fit for purpose, and almost ubiquitously ended in one kind of failure or another, but at least it was an effort at something, and not just a sad sterile foreclosure on the possibility of life. Of course if we all stay alone and practise celibacy and carefully police our personal boundaries, many problems will be avoided, but it seems we will also have almost nothing left that makes life worthwhile.""""And in the morning I wake up feeling almost painfully happy.

Edited by Tom Gatti of the New Statesman, it's a collection of pieces from fifty different writers about their favourite album - where they were in their life when they first heard it, what they like most about it and why it continues to mean so much to them.And quite an esteemed list of authors it features too, with the likes of George Saunders, Eimear McBride and Marlon James all providing an account of their most treasured LPs. I found that the pieces I enjoyed most were about albums I shared a love for. Olivia Laing remembers those teenage years of playing R.E.M.'s Automatic for the People in her bedroom, and a letter from a pen-friend that had the lyrics of the gorgeous Find the River twisted around the envelope. Jason Cowley talks about his love for Talk Talk's magnificent The Colour of Spring and how he used to listen to it on a Walkman during a dreary two-hour bus commute to a job in London. The standout essay for me was David Mitchell discussing the first time he heard Joni Mitchell's Blue, a vivid recollection of buying the cassette the day after completing his A-Levels and pressing play, transforming his ""understanding of what songs could do and what singers could be.""All in all, it's a wonderful blend of memoir and music criticism. My only complaint was that some of the pieces were too short - I found myself settling in for a good story of how the writer came to love an album I also admired, when it ended all too soon.

Notes on a Scandal rightly earned lots of plaudits, but The Believers was the book that won me over, with its confident prose and richly developed characters. Everything You Know was the one I hadn't read, its somewhat cooler s putting me off until now.Our narrator is Willy Muller, a middle-aged writer. Back in the 70s, he had a drunken argument with his wife, who died after banging her head on the kitchen fridge. He served time in prison for murder, but then released a bestselling memoir, exonerating himself from the crime. The book didn't go down well with friends or family, so Willy escaped Britain for the US, leaving his daughters Sophie and Sadie behind. In the present day, he's living in LA and recuperating from a heart attack. Apart from his health issues he seems to be enjoying himself. He's a bit of a ladies' man, to say the least. But then he receives the terrible news that Sadie has committed suicide. Her diaries are sent to him after her death, and as he reads through them, he is finally forced to confront his past.It's a hard book to love, truth be told. Willy is quite an unlikeable person, and it's difficult to understand why so many women are attracted to him. This antihero might have sown the seeds of another dubious main character in Notes on a Scandal. Though Willy's horrible, he can be quite funny, and his scathing thoughts of the LA set in which he mixes made me laugh in the same way Larry David's protagonist in Curb Your Enthusiasm does. And Sadie's heartbreaking voice through her increasingly desperate journals is very well accomplished. It's a debut that showed promise and Heller obviously went on to do greater things.

But to cut him some slack, the Pulitzer Prize winning All the Light We Cannot See is a tough act to follow. And to be fair he has tried to do something completely different with Cloud Cuckoo Land, an audacious, sweeping effort that spans time and space.There are multiple storylines within this sprawling novel. In the present day, 86-year-old Zeno helps a group of children to stage a play in a smalltown library. What he doesn't know is that a teenager with eco-terrorist leanings is waiting to set off a bomb in the building. In 15th century Constantinople, Anna is a failure as a seamstress but ends up under the spell of books. Late at night she leaves the city to explore abandoned buildings, in attempts to acquire rare and valuable tomes. Meanwhile, Omeir, a farmer's son who is ostracised for his cleft lip, looks after his two oxen, not realising that his peaceful life is about to be upended. And in the future, a teenage girl named Konstance lives on board a spaceship travelling to a distant planet. What unites them all is an ancient Greek manuscript, containing a story by Diogenes about a shepherd's journey to a utopia in the sky.So what is the message in Cloud Cuckoo Land? Something about the power of storytelling, I gather, though it's all a bit vague. The problem is that there is too much going on here - the narrative, especially at the beginning, is very unfocussed and jumps around so frequently that it becomes frustrating. Patience is eventually rewarded, and there are some wonderfully affecting scenes, such as Zeno's sad acceptance of unrequited love. A twist in one storyline caught me surprise but also left me wondering what the point of it was (view spoiler)[ there is a late reveal that Konstance's spaceship is not a spaceship at all, but a building in Greenland (hide spoiler)]. There are some neat ideas in this lengthy novel, and I must commend Doerr's ambition, but it didn't quite come together for me....more",Notes are private!,0,53,1,"Sep 14, 2021","Sep 20, 2021","Sep 14, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56783258-cloud-cuckoo-land

I grew up on a farm in County Galway, though I live in Dublin city these days. My country roots are something I might have run from in my youth, but lately I have grown to appreciate them. I have often felt that our tribe is underrepresented in modern Irish literature but finally, here it is. Snowflake is the Great Culchie Novel. When I saw references in the story to Wavin pipes, standing in gaps to move cattle and traditions like Cemetery Sunday, I knew I was in the hands of a true bogger.But all joking aside, Snowflake is a terrific debut. Our narrator Debbie has recently finished school and is planning to study English at Trinity College. She lives on a dairy farm with her mother and Uncle Billy, who sleeps in a caravan at the back of the house. Her father has never been in the picture, though a gruff but kind Billy informally takes up some of these duties. James, a young man who helps to milk the cows, is in a relationship with Debbie's mum. She's an eccentric to say the least, known to dance naked in nettles and record her dreams in a compulsive manner. Dublin and Trinity are a huge shock to Debbie's system, having to ask a Garda for directions to the college on her first day. She befriends a beautiful girl named Xanthe, her wealthy South Dublin upbringing far removed from Debbie's experience. She's beginning to find her way in college, and understand how unusual her family are, when a tragedy strikes the farm, upending her life in ways she could never have expected.Debbie is a very likeable character. Her innocence is endearing - she makes so many mistakes as she comes out of her rural shell but you're rooting for her all the way. She's also quite funny - her witty repartee with Billy and self-deprecating observations made me laugh: ""Anyone else from the country is my competition. There’s only room for one gobshite from the back-arse of nowhere.""But she's also quite hard on herself, and one of the aspects of the book I most admired was the way it addresses mental health. Debbie suffers from anxiety and depression, and her mother has even deeper issues, but they both find help and come out the other side. Our country has not had a great track record in this area, and in rural Ireland the situation can be worse, as there is often a stigma attached to seeking assistance. As Debbie remarks: ""It is socially acceptable to be an alcoholic in our parish as long as you don’t get treatment for it. Being fond of the drink is a form of survival around here."" But I like to think we are getting better as a nation at discussing our feelings, and acknowledging our weaknesses, and books like Snowflake help to keep the conversation going.Snowflake will no doubt end up being compared to another recent Trinity-based bestseller, but it's a really impressive novel in its own right. It's a coming-of-age story that is immensely readable, full of emotional intelligence and sparkling dialogue. If I'm being slightly critical, there is a subplot involving Debbie and her mothers' dreams that I didn't completely buy into. However, this is a minor complaint. Louise Nealon is a writer of major talent and Snowflake is an exciting debut. For this fellow culchie, her next book can't come soon enough....more",Notes are private!,0,49,1,"Sep 07, 2021","Sep 12, 2021","Sep 07, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55577690-snowflake

Set in 1950s Cardiff, it examines the sad demise of Mahmood Hussein Mattan, a Somali seaman who was executed for a murder he didn't commit.And I'm afraid to say I didn't get along with it very well. The opening chapters are quite slow-paced, providing intricate backstories of Mahmood and the Volacki sisters, one of whom is killed. There is a real lack of momentum to this part of the book and I found myself struggling to continue with it. Once the crime had occurred and the police investigation began, I expected the story to perk up, but it still felt like wading through treacle. To my mind, there was a mountain of unnecessary detail, including histories of supporting characters and quite an amount of awkward expository dialogue.I must at least commend the author on her efforts to paint an authentic picture of post-war Cardiff, and her intentions to bring a little-known injustice to light.

The first is set in 1929 and examines the fate of 15-year-old Mehar. Along with two other girls, she has been married to three brothers in rural Punjab, but the identity of her husband is kept from her. Mistakenly believing it to be Suraj, the youngest sibling, she gives herself to him one afternoon, and a relationship blossoms despite the circumstances. In the present day, the narrator recalls the summer of 1999, when he travelled to the same part of India to stay with his uncle, in an attempt to battle his drug addiction. He turns out to be the great grandson of Mehar and is fascinated to hear stories of his ancestor that echo through the village. Assisted by a beguiling local doctor, he takes it upon himself to redevelop the crumbling house in which she lived, including the china room in which the three wives once slept.The book is based on Sahota's family history, specifically a rumour that his great-grandmother was married to one of four brothers, not knowing which. I don't know if the young man battling the heroin problem is him, but it's a convincing account of a self-destructive struggle. I've seen a few s complaining that the two storylines don't have enough connecting them, but I disagree. There is the family link, and the present-day narrator comes to recognise the trauma that both he and his forebear went through. There is also an element of forbidden love to both strands. For me, the juxtaposition of storylines worked, and the book held me under its spell, wondering how the main characters would overcome their difficulties. A deserving Booker nominee, China Room is a precisely crafted and engrossing tale.Favourite Quotes:""Later, she’ll wonder if that is the essence of being a man in the world, not simply desiring a thing, but being able to voice that desire out loud.""""‘You know what the best thing is about falling out of love?

It begins in the 1980s with the death of the mother, Rachel Swart. Her husband Manie and children are all grief-stricken. Eldest child Anton returns from the army, with no motivation to continue in that role, and vague ambitions of writing a novel. Amor, the youngest, is more concerned with the vow her mother made to Salome, the family's black servant. On her death bed she instructed her husband that the woman should be given full ownership of the house she lived in, which was located on the Swart's property. Over the years Rachel's promise seems to fade from the family mindset, but Amor never forgets. And a decade later, when the Swarts reunite due to another bereavement, she intends to raise the matter once again.I probably wouldn't have read this novel had it not been longlisted for the Booker Prize. I'd heard of it, but the synopsis never really grabbed me. And to be honest, I didn't find the story very captivating. None of the characters were particularly interesting, and there was nobody to root for, except maybe Amor, though I never fully understood her motivations. I must admit that the book is well written - I especially admired how the narration moved so fluidly between cast members.

ThiPete Paphides is a UK music journalist, and has worked as a critic for many notable publications such as The Guardian, Melody Maker and The Times. This memoir is a recollection of his childhood, a story of chip shops and pop songs as he eloquently puts it.Paphides was born in Birmingham in 1969 to a Greek mother and a Greek Cypriot father. His parents relocated from Greece to the UK as a young couple, which was originally intended to a be a temporary stay. They ran a succession of fish and chip shops, working long, hard hours. Takis, as Paphides was known back then, remembers playing pinball in a room at the back of the shop with some of the older customers.For almost four years when he was a boy, Paphides did not speak to anybody besides his parents and older brother Aki. He still can't explain why this selective mutism occurred - he was referred to psychologists who failed to solve the problem. He did have a lisp and was quite a sensitive child, which may have contributed to his condition. His more confident brother was key to eventually coaxing him out of his shell.Paphides' love of music was formed at an early age, and it is a joy to read about. As soon as he had any pocket money to spend, it was all shelled out on records. He fondly recalls his love for the likes of ABBA, Dexy's Midnight Runners and The Jam, and reveals an unhealthy obsession with others like comedy pop group The Barron Knights. His brother Aki often turned up his nose at some of those less fashionable bands, listening instead to the much cooler Echo and the Bunnymen, which little Takis grew to admire.There seems to have been quite an amount of tension in the family at certain times during his childhood. His father was a workaholic and expected his wife to share the same ethic, which soon began to affect her health. Christmas was always a fraught affair, as his Dad wrestled with the notion of travelling to Cyprus for a few days, and then having to deal with the agonizing homesickness on his return to Birmingham. He eventually gave up on the idea altogether and could be moody around the holidays. But on the whole his parents come across as caring and generous, and Paphides looks back on these times fondly.I imagine that UK children of the 1970s would identify with lots of the material in this book - recollections of Woolworths, Dial-a-Disc and The Wombles will undoubtedly bring the memories flooding back. But you don't have to be of a certain age or nationality to enjoy Broken Greek. It's a stirring tale of an immigrant family's struggle to make it in a new country. And it's also a joyful account of how a young boy grew to worship pop music, how it gave him an identity and shaped him into the person he is today. And Paphides' giddy, rapturous descriptions of the songs and bands he loved back then make it an absolute pleasure to read....more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,"Aug 10, 2021","Aug 15, 2021","Aug 10, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/51830614-broken-greek

She's a magazine columnist who has just turned 40, and her husband Patrick has left her. She moves back into the London home of her parents - her father is an unpublished poet and her mother a famous sculptor, who has struggled with alcohol addiction for years. But Martha has had her own issues since she was 17, suffering from depression and suicidal thoughts. Because of the medication she was prescribed, she was told that she should never get pregnant. She has forced herself to accept this, but it has been a source of contention with her romantic partners. She enjoys spending time with her sister Ingrid and her children, but can't help feeling envious. As she spends time in the house she grew up in, she looks back on her life and how she got to this point.Sorrow and Bliss has been compared to the TV series Fleabag and I can see why. Martha is an extremely witty, sharp-tongued narrator, similar to Phoebe Waller-Bridge's eponymous heroine. But there is also a darker side to her pysche, a sense that the humour is only serving to distract from unhappier thoughts. Above all, the book is an honest and unflinching portrait of mental illness, even though the condition Martha suffers from is never named. And it is often very moving, as she comes to terms with things in life that she can never have, and pushes away the people she loves. The story is by turns hilarious and heartbreaking, and the writing is always astute. An exciting debut from Meg Mason, I hope there is more to come from her.Favourite Quotes:""We extended the lease by six months, fourteen times, as though things could not work out at any moment.""""A friend of Ingrid’s, who came over once when I was there, told me that the Headspace app had changed her life.

You are terrified. You are going to vomit. Your lungs are closing. The room is moving. Something bad is about to happen. It’s already in the room. It is making your back cold.

It is very much a personal tale of Mick Fleetwood's existenIf you're looking for a definitive history of Fleetwood Mac, this is not the book for you. It is very much a personal tale of Mick Fleetwood's existence, with as many pages given to his love life than the actual band.Fleetwood begins this memoir with his childhood, which seemed quite a happy one. His father was in the RAF and the family moved around a lot, but he found it easy enough to make friends. He admits that he had no real academic ability, and that once he started to learn the drums, he knew he had found his purpose in life. He moved to London and drummed in various blues groups, before meeting up with Peter Green and John McVie to form the first incarnation of Fleetwood Mac.This era of the band I am not as familiar with and I found it quite fascinating to read about. Green began to suffer mentally, which has often been attributed to his LSD usage, something Fleetwood denies. The sad fates of two other members, Jeremy Spencer and Danny Kirwan are also discussed. Spencer left an LA hotel one day to buy a magazine and never returned. He was later discovered to have joined a religious cult. Kirwan struggled with alcohol addiction and the pressures of being in a band, which resulted in him having a breakdown. At this point Fleetwood Mac seemed doomed, but they were eventually resurrected in a new lineup, featuring the mercurial talents of Christine McVie, Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. And once the album Rumours came out, they were unstoppable.Fleetwood married Jenny Boyd (sister-in law of George Harrison) in 1970. They had two children together, but their relationship was quite a tumultuous one. He explains that they were never very good at communicating with one another, breaking up and reuniting several times. But his admission of an affair with Stevie Nicks seemed to be the final straw for Boyd, who finished with him for good. He then complicated things further by having a fling with Nicks' best friend Sara. It's hard to feel much sympathy for him - his womanizing got him into trouble more than once.Contrary to other ers, I found Fleetwood quite a self-deprecating and self-critical narrator. He often refers to his lack of musical ability and seems genuinely remorseful over his failed marriages, particularly to Boyd. His rock'n'roll life style often took priority over his family and you do get the feeling that he has some regrets over this. I suppose it's hard not to be affected by the that level of fame, when every whim is catered for. For example while on tour, the band used to insist on having hotel suites repainted pink before their arrival, specifically for Nicks and Christine McVie. And the mountains of cocaine they all consumed would surely make a dramatic impact on anyone's personality.I would have enjoyed a more forensic account on the music side of things, especially around the recording of some of my best-loved albums like Tango in the Night. However, that's not really what this book is. It's Mick Fleetwood telling you his story, about what it's like to be a member of one of the biggest rock bands and about all of the temptations and excess that such a lifestyle brings. An entertaining read, but it left me wanting a more substantial and comprehensive chronicle of one of my favourite groups....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Jul 27, 2021","Aug 02, 2021","Jul 27, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18081400-play-on

I also felt sympathy for the two of them, sheltered as they are, particularly Jeanie, who can't even read or write. They are cursed with bad luck, ever since the tragic death of their father. But the tension of the plot builds towards the revelation of a big secret and when it arrives, it is a bit of a letdown. It all felt completely obvious to me at any rate, and not the major surprise it was intended to be. Still, there is plenty to enjoy about this atmospheric story - its characters are memorable, and it is a thoughtful portrayal of folk who live on the margins of modern society. ...more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"Jul 13, 2021","Jul 25, 2021","Jul 13, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53341634-unsettled-ground

Hungry Paul lives with his parents, who are retired, and occasionally fills in as a postman. Leonard visits his pal's house to play board games and the whole family often join in. Their discussion these days mostly revolves around the upcoming wedding of Grace, Hungry Paul's sister. But Leonard has other stuff on his mind too. For one thing, he has made the acquaintance of Shelley, a girl at work, and this has set all kinds of thoughts in motion. It might even prove a solution to his growing loneliness. And Hungry Paul has entered a competition to come up with a new sign-off phrase for the local Chamber of Commerce. These might seem like small events for most people, but for the two friends, they are significant, and this sets in motion a momentous few weeks in their otherwise quiet lives.Leonard and Hungry Paul is a gentle, touching story and I reckon it can be classed as uplit, a literary genre which has become popular in recent times. I certainly thought of books like The Rosie Project and Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine while reading this one. The pair are quite awkward socially - Leonard is shy and low on confidence, while Hungry Paul displays some symptoms of autism, even though it is never explicitly mentioned. It is a joy to see them both leave their comfort zones and open themselves up to the world. The story is often quite funny - some of the stuff Hungry Paul came out with made me chuckle, even though his humour was often unintentional. I suppose the message the book is trying to put across is that we're all different, and that a person deserves to be loved for who they are, rather than who they're expected to be. And that's a worthy sentiment if you ask me.

An accomplished author, now in her This is the third book in Elizabeth Strout's Amgash series, after My Name Is Lucy Barton and Anything Is Possible. An accomplished author, now in her sixties, Lucy is the central character once again. These days she's living in New York city and mourning the loss of her second husband David, a cellist. But the novel is mostly concerned with William, her first husband, with whom she retains a complicated relationship.Lucy and William have two adult daughters and remain on amicable terms. In fact, they often call each other and meet up for advice, which William's new partner Estelle doesn't seem to have a problem with. Lucy still has some feelings for William but she also thinks back to the problems they had during their marriage, which caused her to leave him.Over the course of a few days, William receives some shocking news. For one thing, it turns out he has a half-sister that he never knew about. He decides to travel to Maine to see if he can make contact with her, and asks Lucy to join him. The journey stirs old memories - Lucy remembers why she fell in love with him, but she also recalls all the ways in which he infuriated her.The story is told in conversational style, which I'm not all that keen on in this instance. It consists mostly of Lucy telling anecdotes from her childhood and about her adult relationships, which makes it rather one-sided and doesn't have the same moments of insight or perception that a more balanced book like Olive Kitteridge has, for example. However, it does examine subjects like old age and marriage in a nuanced manner. And I admired the sensitive way it addresses childhood trauma - Lucy still bears the scars of her difficult, poverty-stricken upbringing, but she has learned to live with it. Overall, the book feels like catching up with an old friend, listening to her tell you about her joys and woes. And though she has some sad stories to tell, it is a pleasure to be back in Lucy Barton's company once again. Favourite Quotes:""Grief is such a— oh, it is such a solitary thing; this is the terror of it, I think. It is like sliding down the outside of a really long glass building while nobody sees you.""""People are lonely, is my point here. Many people can’t say to those they know well what it is they feel they might want to say.""""As we drove I suddenly had a visceral memory of what a hideous thing marriage was for me at times those years with William: a familiarity so dense it filled up the room, your throat almost clogged with knowledge of the other so that it seemed to practically press into your nostrils— the odor of the other’s thoughts, the self-consciousness of every spoken word, the slight flicker of an eyebrow slightly raised, the barely perceptible tilting of the chin; no one but the other would know what it meant; but you could not be free living like that, not ever. Intimacy became a ghastly thing.""...more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,"Jun 29, 2021","Jul 04, 2021","Jun 29, 2021",,Audio CD,view (with text),/book/show/56244165-oh-william

And luxury flats stood on crumbling slums like shining false teeth on rotten gums.""This tale of multiple interconnected characters is set in the infamous London district of Soho. Precious is a prostitute who works in a local brothel. Agatha, the building's billionaire owner, wants to evict her tenants and develop the property. She's the daughter of Donald Howard, a notorious gangland boss, who left his empire to his youngest child, much to the consternation of her older siblings. Bastian is the son of Agatha's lawyer, a public-school educated fellow who is in a steady relationship, but can't help thinking back to a girl he knew at university. Robert is a retired gangster and frequenter of the aforementioned brothel. And Cheryl Lavery is a member of the area's homeless population, who goes missing. These are just some of the people whose lives will intersect in unexpected ways before the story is through.Hot Stew is the eagerly anticipated follow-up to Elmet, Mozley's Booker shortlisted debut. And the setting couldn't be more different, swapping the fields of Yorkshire for the busy streets of Soho. She does a good job of addressing the problems of the district, like homelessness and the unstoppable gentrification. But I think she has been over-ambitious with the sheer number of the characters in this sprawling story. With so many plates spinning, it's difficult to keep the plot humming, and I found some members of the cast more interesting than others.

The story begins with This captivating novel focuses on the life of Andrew Haswell Green, the man who is considered ""the Father of Greater New York."" The story begins with his death, murdered outside his front door by a distressed individual named Cornelius Williams. The book then splits into two narratives. The first takes a look at highlights from Green's life. We learn about his humble beginnings, working on the meagre family farm. In his teens, he is sent to New York to become an apprentice in a general store, in the hopes of setting him on the path to earn a respectable living (""His family feared he might one day succumb to the catastrophe of being a poet""). There he falls under the spell of the two real loves of his life - books, and his great friend Samuel Tilden. The second plot strand takes a look at the investigation into Green's death, led by the capable Inspector McClusky, who tries his best to understand the motive behind the murder.The Great Mistake is billed as historical fiction, but it's all based on events in the life of a real person, so a 'reimagining' might be a more accurate description. I had never heard of Green before reading the book, and I was amazed to learn about the enormous impact he had on New York City, being responsible for the creation of Central Park and New York Public Library, among many other significant projects. The story also captures Green's profound loneliness and I found this quite moving. He was obviously gay, though never able to publicly acknowledge the fact, and his repressed sexuality only served to drive him further into himself. His close friendship with Tilden seemed to be a single source of comfort, and though it appears his deeper feelings were reciprocated, they both held back from pursuing a relationship. Lee also paints a vivid picture of a bustling and booming New York, a melting pot of multiple cultures, still scrabbling to forge its true identity. I didn't find the police investigation quite as riveting as other ers, but that's probably down to my own personal preference. The Great Mistake is an immersive, poignant tale, and a fitting tribute to the life of a man who deserves to remembered.Favourite Quotes:""He loved this city. He hated it. It was a cathedral of possibilities, it would never settle down, it might remember him or it might forget him, there was a sense of no control...""""He likes the way the slightest impressions are magnified at this early hour: the distant crack of a cratemaker’s hammer; the flat beauty of a flake of downtrodden tobacco; the vendor pulling a cart out of the shack on the other side of the street, ears all aquiver with the effort. This is an area of hatters and druggists, of print shops and bookstores, of hackney coachmen waiting on corners praying for rain.""""Eighty-three years old. A lifetime of being a bachelor. This extended life of aloneness might have an effect on a man’s character, might it not? Independence might have rusted into obstinacy.""""You wake up one day and realize you are a different person. That seems to be how life happens, how it establishes its patterns. The adult becomes a stranger to the boy he used to be. You become distant from everybody, especially yourself, even if, in the secrecy of your heart, you feel mostly unchanged.""""And was it so bad, really, to be plagued by regret? Might our private loneliness, our most crushing inner fears, push us outward, at times, into greater public good? The building of bridges, of open spaces, of consolidated places where others might feel less alone?

Kevin Power burst onto the Irish literary scene in 2008 with Bad Day in Blackrock, which was later turned into an acclaimed film by Lenny Abrahamson. We've had a while to wait for his second novel, and Power recently gave a fascinating account of his writing struggles in the Irish Times. But White City has finally arrived, and it is a pleasure to be back in his capable hands.Like Power's debut, it's also a tale of privilege and greed involving a wealthy family from Dublin's southside. Our narrator is 27-year-old Ben, son of a highly successful banker. Ben has drifted through the majority of this life of luxury, with faint ambitions of becoming a writer. His relationship with his parents is distant at best. And lately things have begun to fall apart. For one thing, he is telling his story from a rehab facility called St Augustine's, his drug habit having finally got the better of him. His father is being investigated by the authorities for embezzling an eye-watering sum of money. His relationship with girlfriend Clio is on the rocks. And he seems to have got himself into trouble with some kind of shady property deal. Ben's problems keep mounting and St Augustine's might be his last chance at figuring his life out.Ben is a difficult character to warm to. He's a total narcissist, which Clio regularly tells him. He's selfish and self-destructive - the number of drugs he takes just to get through the day signifies much deeper issues. Yet's he's also self-aware, looking back on past deeds, and this is the one reason why I would cut him some slack. He realises now that he has acted like a horrible person. He's quite hard on himself and there are hints of his intentions to change his ways.Power writes brilliantly about affluence and avarice in post Celtic-Tiger Ireland - the sense of entitlement embedded in this private-school educated set, their in-built arrogance and gigantic egos. The fact that he manages to generate any sympathy at all for Ben's plight is some feat. If I was to criticise the book in any way, I would say that the Serbian-based chapters didn't always ring true. Some of the characters in those pages felt a bit clichéd and two-dimensional. But maybe I'm nitpicking. I found so much to admire in this captivating, witty tale.

There has been a bit of a backlash against celebrity authors in recent times - claims that publishers are trading on big names to sell books, with a distinct lack of literary quality about them. But I have to say that this one is different. Osman can certainly write and I'm sure that this will be the first of a very successful series.It's set in a retirement community in rural England, where four elderly friends meet up every Thursday to examine cold cases. It's a bit more exciting than jigsaws and crossword puzzles I suppose. There's Joyce, a chatty and genial sort, who narrates part of the story. Ron is a loud, argumentative fellow whose son was a famous boxer. Ibrahim is a former psychiatrist, an attentive and inquisitive gentleman. And then there's Elizabeth, the most dogged investigator of them all, who has a shady past that might have involved some kind of espionage - nobody is really sure. One day a murder happens on their own doorstep, conveniently enough. Our four heroes decide to take it upon themselves to solve the crime, with the reluctant help of the local police.Osman used to co-present a popular quiz show called Pointless on the BBC, and was famous for his quick wit. He uses those skills to great effect here - the way the quartet run rings around the police and coerce them into revealing information left me quite amused. But I also admired the sensitive way in which the story tackled various problems of the elderly: the loneliness they can face, the difficulties with various ailments, caring for partners who can longer take care of themselves. As for the murder plot though, I'm not sure I can praise it in the same way. It all became quite convoluted and the denouement felt rushed and unconvincing. Maybe I'm being a bit harsh.

Instead it takes a look at some key figures throughout the Troubles, specifically on the Republican side. Like Dolours Price, a young woman who was convinced to join the cause after a peaceful protest she took part in was met with Loyalist violence. She ended up carrying out several dangerous missions for the IRA and at one point went on hunger strike. There's also Brendan Hughes, a significant member of the Provos, his military acumen proving invaluable, but a man with many regrets at the end of his life. Most heartbreaking of all, the book investigates the disappearance of Jean McConville, a widowed mother of ten who was kidnapped from a Belfast flat one December night, and never seen again. Patrick Radden Keefe is a journalist for the New Yorker. He has some Irish ancestry on his father's side, but he was never really interested in the Troubles, until he read Dolours Price's obituary, and heard about the Boston College tapes, a secret project where ex-paramilitaries discussed their roles in the conflict. He brings a refreshingly unbiased insight to the subject, and his painstaking research has paid off in spades. Say Nothing is a riveting read, whether it's examining the delicate political situation in Northern Ireland, the nefarious deeds of the IRA or the devastating impact on the families who lost loved ones. Parts of it even read like a thriller - the account of the 1973 London bombings had me on the edge of my seat. The book is most damning of all on Gerry Adams, the former Sinn Fein President who has always denied his membership of the IRA. It leaves no doubt as to his involvement as a leader of that organisation. Whether he will ever face repercussions for those actions remains to be seen. Say Nothing is a stunning achievement: Radden Keefe's exceptional storytelling and dogged reporting shines new light on a society haunted by the memories of past atrocities.P.S. For fans of Patrick Radden Keefe's work, I highly recommend his podcast Wind of Change, which investigates a rumour that a song by a popular German band was written by the CIA.

After his term had ended, he decided to write a book about one of the main health scourges he had encountered while travelling around the country. Not smoking, or the opioid crisis, but loneliness.Murthy was shocked by the number of lonely patients he met and their struggles really moved him. He tells the story of James, a baker who worked hard at his job and was good at it. He was single but lived among a community of people that he liked and felt appreciated for who he was. Then James won the lottery, and everything changed. He quit his baking role and moved to a luxury house by the ocean. But his life was no longer fulfilling - he didn't know anybody in this new location and he became withdrawn and angry. Spending most of his time alone at home, he put on lots of weight, contracted diabetes and ended up absolutely miserable.There is scientific evidence that loneliness is a danger to our health. Murthy points to a study carried out by Dr Julianne Holt-Lunstad of Brigham Young University. It found that people with strong social relationships are 50 per cent less likely to die prematurely than people with weak social relationships. It also discovered that the impact of loneliness on reducing life span is equal to smoking 15 cigarettes a day, and that it poses a greater risk than obesity or excessive alcohol consumption.However, Murthy also claims that loneliness ""serves a vital function by warning us when something essential for our survival - social connection - is lacking."" Connecting with other people is the key to beating this hardship, he concludes:""Our greatest moments of joy involve other people - the birth of a child, finding love, reunions with dear friends. And our moments of greatest sorrow often involve separation and loss of those connections - the death of a loved one, a romantic breakup, an irreconcilable dispute with a close friend.""So who is this book for? It's not really a self-help guide for lonely folk. It's more an examination of a heartbreaking condition, providing examples of the suffering it has caused and describing the ways in which it can be tackled. Loneliness is something that many people feel shame about admitting to, and maybe a book like this is a valuable way of opening the discussion, and helping us understand that it is far more common affliction than anybody realises.

It's the 1950s and she works as a journalist on the North Kent Echo, writing a weekly column that provides household tips. Now in her late thirties, she takes care of her elderly mother and spends her free time tending to the garden. One day, the newspaper receives a curious letter.

But she also becomes close to the Tilbury family, and feelings begin to stir that she long ago given up on. Jean has never been in a romantic relationship and she has made her peace with this. She even manages to convince herself that her average looks are a blessing in disguise: ""She had no illusions or anxieties about her own lack of physical beauty; her ordinariness, in fact, grew less irksome with every passing year. It had been dispiriting to be plain at twenty, but by forty it hardly mattered. Time had caught up with most of her prettier contemporaries and those with the most to lose seemed to feel its depredations the hardest.""But then love comes into Jean's life, most unexpectedly. I won't mention the subject of her affections for fear of spoilers. But with this person, even before anything has happened between the two of them, she feels: ""nothing but warmth and kindness and the certainty of some feeling not yet declared, but even so accepted and returned.""However, these feelings frighten her - she's terrified of the pain she will suffer if things don't work out: ""She wondered how many years – if ever – it would be before the monster of awakened longing was subdued and she could return to placid acceptance of a limited life. The journey into love was so effortless and graceful; the journey out such a long and laboured climb.""This book works on two levels. First there is the mystery of the virgin birth, which is compelling enough in its own right. But then there is Jean's story: the loneliness she tries not to think about, the happiness which has always seemed so far from reach, now tantalizingly close. She's a shy, good-natured person who has resigned herself to a life of solitude, until something miraculous happens. And as long-term singleton myself, I absolutely rooted for her.

When I got to the chapter narrated by a cat, my dedication began to falter. But the high praise from Stephen King on the cover made me reconsider. ""I haven't read anything this exciting since Gone Girl,"" he enthuses. Well that's a heck of an endorsement, I thought to myself, so I better read on.At the beginning we meet Ted Bannerman. And he's a bit of an oddball: he lives in a dirty old house on Needless Street that has boarded-up windows, with his cat Olivia. Ted doesn't have a job or seem to have any friends. He thinks a lot about the past, and he remembers that today is the eleven-year anniversary of Little Girl With Popsicle. This was a six-year old who went missing at a nearby lake. Ted's house was searched at the time and his photo was printed in a local newspaper, but he had a solid alibi and wasn't charged. Her body was never found. The girl's name was Lulu and her older sister Dee hasn't given up on finding her. She eventually tracks down the newspaper photo and identifies Ted from it. Moving into the house next door, she keeps a close eye on Ted's residence and notices some strange events. Also, it seems like there might be another person living with him. Dee is determined to get inside and see for herself, but if Ted really is who she thinks he is, this could be a very dangerous plan.I suppose I would classify this story as a mystery, with some elements of horror. The author does a good job of misdirection, and the explanation for all the peculiarity at the beginning makes total sense by the end. Though I couldn't help feeling a little bit cheated by some of the plot twists, such as (view spoiler)[ the revelation that Dee hasn't been telling the truth about her own role in Lulu's disappearance  (hide spoiler)]. The multiple narrators all have a unique voice, even if I felt some of them worked better than others. However, the main thing that kept me reading was the suspense: I really wanted to find out what happened to Lulu. So I don't agree with Mr King's claim, but I still think this book is a worthwhile read - it's a compelling and unusual mystery that will certainly keep you guessing....more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,"Apr 13, 2021","Apr 18, 2021","Apr 13, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54621094-the-last-house-on-needless-street

In the past year alone, the likes of Naoise Dolan and Megan Nolan have publishedThe conveyor belt of Irish writing talent shows no signs of stopping. In the past year alone, the likes of Naoise Dolan and Megan Nolan have published debut novels to much acclaim. And with this superb first collection, the name of John Patrick McHugh can be added to the burgeoning list of gifted authors.These eight stories are set on the fictional island of Keel, off the coast of Mayo. And they capture the atmosphere of rural Ireland so well: the air of menace that sometimes lingers beneath the countryside's beautiful facade, the community's reliance on alcohol as a social lubricant, a place where everybody knows your business whether you like it or not.Bonfire tells the story of a couple of young pyromaniacs, who ""hunted after the cocky spark and clunk of the lighter, the peacock-ruffle of a catching blaze, the flame and all its bold promises."" The title tale is about two teenagers who meet up one morning with a terrible hangover, ""glue-lipped, dangling on the border between the horrors and the thirst"". After deciding that the only course of action is for more beer to take the edge off, their drinking plans are interrupted by some unwelcome guests.To be honest, I enjoyed every story in the book, but two stood out in my mind. Howya, Horse is about an eventful house party, one that I feel like I have been to many times in my wilder days. It's funny and surprising, but it's also incredibly perceptive about young relationships, in the same kind of way Sally Rooney has been noted for. And I loved Twelve Pubs, about three men who embark on annual Christmas drinking ritual in the local village. Over the course of a few pages, McHugh imparts so much wisdom about friendship, masculinity and peer pressure, among other subjects.I also thought of Colin Barrett and Kevin Barry while reading this collection. It shares their darker vision of rural Ireland, shot through with devilish humour. But it's unfair to draw too many comparisons to other authors. John Patrick McHugh has a literary voice all of his own, and I'm already looking forward reading more from this exciting new talent....more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,"Apr 06, 2021","Apr 11, 2021","Apr 06, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/56504077-pure-gold

I was over at the Fringe in Edinburgh when I turned on the wifi on my phone one morning. It instantly lit up with notifications and messages. This was a human being who had touched many lives - his death was so abrupt and shocking that it felt like the world was mourning. Even though I was supposed to be enjoying my holidays, a sense of sadness overtook me.This book was published not long afterwards. It attempts to uncover the man behind that loud and wacky persona, to investigate what really made him tick. And I think that it succeeds on that level. I also learned a lot of things that I didn't know about Williams, such as:- He grew up a in a wealthy family and lived in a series of mansions as his father moved about in his job with Ford- He was a very bright student and was taking a course in political science before he dropped out to pursue acting- I didn't realise how popular his stand-up comedy was. On this side of the pond, he is mostly known for his movies, so his HBO specials and Grammy for Best Comedy Album were news to me- His first major TV series, Mork and Mindy, was an instant hit, and Williams became a huge star in the US pretty much overnight- His movie career however, consisted of a string of flops for a number of years, until the script for Good Morning Vietnam fell into his lapItzkoff goes into detail about the sheer joy Williams received from performing, the intense rush that it gave him. But he also explores how tough the lifestyle of a comedian really is, and how Robin leaned on drugs and alcohol to get him through it. Even though he often mined it for laughs it in his stand-up routines, he struggled with addiction throughout his life.The book also examines the last of years of Williams' life and it really is tragic to read about. He became extremely paranoid and his whole personality seemed to change. Friends found him unrecognizable. His suicide was a complete shock to his family, but we now know that he had been suffering from Lewy body dementia, a degenerative brain disease. His wife says that he knew he was losing his mind and he kept telling her that he needed to reboot it. For a man identified by his sharp wit, it must have been his worst nightmare.You get a good sense of the kind of man Williams was from reading this book. A comic genius of course, but driven by the need for adulation, and often consumed by insecurity about his abilities. Being the film buff that I am, I would have enjoyed a more in-depth discussion of his movies, particularly the likes of Dead Poets Society and Good Will Hunting. But overall, this biography is a fitting tribute to the blazing talent and sad demise of Robin Williams.

I read a  of it in The Sunday Times a few weeks ago and I was amazed at what an unpleasant person it described. Highsmith didn't seem to like people very much and channeled this hate into her characters. I've enjoyed some of the movie adaptations of her work such as Carol and The Talented Mr. Ripley, but I'd never read her novels, so I decided to give This Sweet Sickness a try.The story begins in upstate New York and is narrated by David Kelsey, a young chemist. He's a man with a problem: his true love Anabelle is married to somebody else. But David is certain that everything will work out in the end. During the week he lives in a boarding house with various nosy and interfering inhabitants. The weekends though, he spends at a house in a nearby town, purchased under a fake name. He believes this dream home will be enough to win Annabelle over and often fantasizes about her presence there. David doesn't have many friends - there is an office colleague named Wes that he sometimes shares a drink with. And a girl called Effie at the boarding house who seems to have a crush at him. They are merely distractions from his grand plan - David will win Annabelle's affections, no matter the cost.This Sweet Sickness is an incredibly creepy tale of infatuation and unrequited love. Highsmith does an amazing job of getting inside an obsessive mind. David is utterly deluded throughout - anyone can see that Annabelle has no interest in him, and she's too polite to tell him to get lost. Every kind of setback in his conquest is put aside - he is absolutely determined that they will end up together. And the character of Effie is a clever invention, a girl who is just as besotted with him as he is with Annabelle. Yet David sees her as pathetic, an annoyance. He's a calculating, devious individual but his lies eventually get him into trouble. It's an uncomfortable yet gripping read, a psychological thriller that demonstrates Highsmith's rare ability to imagine the motivations of tormented and depraved characters....more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,"Mar 23, 2021","Mar 28, 2021","Mar 23, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/768987.This_Sweet_Sickness

So I needed no encouragement to read her follow-up novel, the highly-anticipated Transcendent Kingdom. And it turns out that this is a much more reflective, intimate tale than its predecessor.Gifty is a 28-year-old scientist, born in Huntsville, Alabama to Ghanian parents. At the beginning of the story, she tells us that her mother has fallen into a deep depression and that this is the second time in her life that it has happened. The family pastor sends her to stay with Gifty at Stanford, but as soon as she arrives, she takes to bed. Gifty tells her about her work, in which she experiments on mice to study the neurological effects of addiction. However, her mother shows no interest, only asking Gifty if she still prays. She has always been a deeply religious woman, and Gifty was brought up in the same tradition, but her faith has wavered in recent years. Gifty also thinks back to her childhood and the family tragedy that initiated her mother's first depression.This a sad and quiet novel about a lonely young woman. Gifty has been so haunted by the effects of addiction on her family that she makes it her life's work to understand the condition. And this seems to be at the cost of her personal happiness, as the few friends she spends time with in Stanford are all through her job. She also wrestles with the question of science versus religion quite a bit. Even though her colleagues are quick to dismiss the Church, and she has drifted from it herself, there are Christian values that she still holds dear.To be honest, I missed the scope and ambition of Homegoing, but I suppose it shows that Yaa Gyasi can write personal, smaller-scale stories too. It's a moving tale of grief and addiction that asks some difficult questions. It's also an eye-opening portrait of the immigrant experience.

After undergoing extensive counselling, Lex and her siblings were placed under the care of different families.

She has slept with a lot of the men in the office, which has not done wonders for her popularity. Her apartment is mouse-ridden and she paints in her spare time - she's good, but not quite good enough. One day she hooks up with Eric, a rich white archivist twice her age. They don't have much in common but there is an indisputable attraction. After losing her job and running out of options, Edie turns up one day at Eric's house. His wife Rebecca finds her in their bedroom but instead of confronting Edie, she invites her to stay. It just so happens that the couple have an adopted black daughter named Akila, who has no friends. Perhaps Edie might bond with Akila and coax her out of her shell? So begins a strange dynamic between four very different people.Edie narrates the story and though I didn't particularly enjoy her company, she is undeniably witty. She's like the friend you know is a bad influence, but makes you laugh even when you shouldn't, whether she's describing her commute: ""I almost lose a seat to a woman who gets on at Union Square, but luckily her pregnancy slows her down"" or daydreaming about the partner of her latest conquest: ""Despite myself, I have been thinking about his wife all day. I find myself hoping she is a vocal participant in her neighborhood watch. It would also be reassuring if she lies completely still during sex."" Despite her sexual promiscuity, she's a very lonely person and she understands that her seclusion is a vicious circle: ""This was the contradiction that would define me for years, my attempt to secure undiluted solitude and my swift betrayal of this effort once in the spotlight of an interested man. I was pretending not to worry about the consequences of my isolation. But whenever I talked to anyone, I found myself overcompensating for the atrophy of my social muscles."" Eventually she realises that there is nothing wondrous about Eric and she is hard on herself for being duped: ""He is the most obvious thing that has ever happened to me, and all around the city it is happening to other silly, half-formed women excited by men who’ve simply met the prerequisite of living a little more life, a terribly unspecial thing that is just what happens when you keep on getting up and brushing your teeth and going to work and ignoring the whisper that comes to you at night and tells you it would be easier to be dead.""Luster is a tale of unusual connections and complex relationships.

Jivan does have an alibi - she was on the way to teach her neighbour Lovely when the explosion happened. Lovely is an aspiring actress and testifying on her friend's behalf is agreeable, given her appetite for the spotlight.

Younger sister Ellen brings up their dead father, causing their mother to snap and leave Ellen to walk the rest of the way in the dark by herself. Libby is terrified that something dreadful will happen and her worst fears come true when Ellen is picked up by a strange, long-haired creep they dub Barbie Man. She manages to escape his clutches but not without sustaining some injuries. The whole episode scares the life out of the girls and they fear that Barbie Man will reattempt to harm Ellen. It's not like Libby hasn't enough to deal with already - she's had some disagreements with her best friend Sage, she's trying to figure out boys, and she's still mourning the death of her Dad.

What interested me more was the Gallagher family dynamic: how the children coped with the loss of one parent and the failings of another. Her father's passing clearly weighs heavily on Libby, and the longing and regret she feels is quite moving. It's also a very evocative and lyrical account of a summer in an American teenager's life, before mobile phones and internet. A simpler time maybe, but not without its own complications.

A book so inventive and a joy to read, it has often popped into my head since. So to say that his follow-up has been eagerly awaited on my part is an understatement.Our narrator is Thomas Quinn, an author who is struggling to make ends meet. The death of his father, a famous writer, has been a major blow. But he is also living in the shadow of Andrew Black, his father's protégé, whose only novel Cupid's Engine was a massive bestseller. Plus he is missing his wife Imogen, who is carrying out a science experiment in a distant country. The bills are piling up and the pressure is starting to build on Thomas. But then he a receives a mysterious letter from Black, which includes a photo of a strange dark sphere. He sees a person who looks like the main character of Cupid's Engine on the street, and hears a message from his father on his answering machine. What could it all mean? I still don't know if I fully understand what happened in this story. After an intriguing start, the plot becomes quite chaotic. Thomas digresses into scientific theory, with entropy becoming an important theme. He begins to ponder philosophical questions and consider the power of words. The typography of the text changes into different shapes, like leaves for example. It's all very meta. For me, it was fun trying to connect the dots, but others might find it exasperating. My main criticism is that I didn't form any kind of attachment to Thomas or the other characters, so I wasn't really invested in their fate.

She's intelligent and hard-working, eager to make her immigrant parents proud. One day Cyrus, her high school crush, comes back into her life. He has always been an enigmatic figure, operating on a different wavelength to everybody else. Along with his wealthy friend Jules, he encourages Asha to create a new algorithm, one which takes the hobbies & interests of users and turns them into a ritual. Before long they have developed this idea into a social media platform, and a highly successful one at that. Asha sees her feelings for Cyrus reciprocated and they marry. Their app is more of a triumph than they could ever have imagined, but the whole thing quickly becomes overwhelming, and cracks start to appear in their relationship.I understand that the aim of the book is to satirize tech culture and to show up social media for all of its ridiculousness. However, the story is straining so hard to be topical that it forgets to make its characters compelling. I feel like I have come across Cyrus many times before, the guru with all the answers, who becomes corrupted by power. The plot follows a very predictable path - it held no surprises for me.

In the first few pages, he kills off the five main characters. The year is 1944 and the protagonists are children, shopping in a London Woolworths with their parents, when a German bomb obliterates the building and everyone in it. One minute they exist, the next they do not. Spufford then imagines what their lives would have been like had the explosion never happened, visiting the characters at 15-year intervals.Two of the five are twin sisters, Val and Jo. Val is obsessed with boys when we first meet her, and they are the cause of much strife throughout her existence. Jo displays a love of music at school and this becomes one of her main purposes in life. Vernon's greed manifests in his eventual role as a ruthless property developer, though he shows glimpses of humanity through his fondness for opera. Alec is the class clown, a mischievous fellow whose gifts of persuasion earn him a job as a typesetter. And troubled, delicate Ben tackles some mental difficulties before taking up a position as a bus conductor.I thought of Kate Atkinson's work while reading this book, specifically the wartime efforts of Life After Life and A God in Ruins. Spufford exhibits a similar level of enterprise in this novel, submitting the idea that it's a miracle we're here at all, and giving his story so much heart with its authentic, believable characters. We follow their triumphs and setbacks throughout the years, and marvel at the fact that lives could have been lived so fully, when they could so easily have been snuffed out before they had properly begun.I was a huge fan of Spufford's previous novel, Golden Hill, and while this latest work didn't thrill me in the same way, it left me with a lot more to ponder. Themes like the nature of time, what constitutes a happy life, the impact one individual can have on a multitude are all examined with a grace and clarity that showcase this author's unique talents. It's a brilliant, ambitious book and the unanimous praise being showered upon it is completely deserved.Favourite Quotes:""The bride and groom are sitting up at the top end, she in cream silk with eyelashes the size of escaped caterpillars, he hollow-eyed and the worse for wear from his stag night, but both grinning helplessly, the way you do; both shining with the astonishment of being, themselves, this moment, standing on the magic pivot, the trampoline of transformation, where your life is being changed and for once you know it. Right then, right there, as you feel the dizzy hilarious bliss of it, the change is underway.""""Chance, that she came back to London, chance that she met Claude, chance that she taught for twenty years at Bexford Hill. How can this be her life, how can that be her love, if it rests on such accidents? Surely her real life is still waiting to happen.""""Nobody chooses who they love. Possessing something, being somebody, loving anyone, it rules the rest out, and so it’s quieter than being young, and looking forward, and expecting it all, that’s all. The world calms down when your choice is made.""""It’s that she chafes, secretly, like this; that she is finding, just now, when things are hard, how sharply it seems she can still regret the lives not had, the music never recorded, the fame not gained. Old sorrows she thought were long worked through– no, more than that, which she thought were actually abolished by her having had different desires fulfilled– turn out to be still capable, still bitter, able like ghosts to billow up and start talking, if given a drop of blood to feed upon.""""People say the world gets smaller when you’re dying: but there it still is, as astonishingly much of it as ever. It’s you who shrinks. Or you who can grasp the world less, who can take hold of less and less of it, until you’re only peeping at one burning-bright corner of the whole immense fabric.

Sissy Radley's body was found by Vincent's best friend Walk. In the present day, Walk is the town's police chief and Sissy's beautiful older sister Star is mixed up in trouble. Struggling with substance abuse, she is neglectful of daughter Duchess and son Robin, but Walk does his best to check in on them. Duchess has a fiery streak and a short temper, but shows her softer side when it comes to Robin. Things get complicated when Vincent is released from prison. Walk did his best to stay in touch his pal all these years and never blamed him for the terrible mistake he made. But soon after Vincent gets out, a body shows up, and Cape Haven must deal with the heartbreak all over again.This one took a while to get going for me, but I'm so glad that I stuck with it. I thought the plot lacked a bit of momentum at first, with Walk pining for his childhood, wishing he could turn back the clock. But once the murder happens, things really kick into gear. The characters have real depth, and despite her destructive tendencies, I was really hoping things would turn out well for Duchess. I also rooted for Walk, lonely and well-meaning as he is, keeping my fingers crossed for his one last shot at love. My one criticism is that Duchess's dialogue and thought process is often too advanced for her age.

It begins with memories of a happy childhood and continues with his time in the Rhode Island School of Design, where he met future bandmates Tina Weymouth and David Byrne.Frantz's relationship with these two people forms the most interesting aspect of the story. He was smitten with Weymouth from the start. They married in 1977 and are still together today. Frantz declares his undying love for Weymouth multiple times throughout the book, and it is sweet, even though it gets a little repetitive.On the other hand, there is no love lost between Frantz and Byrne. He accuses Byrne of taking the credit for most of the bands' work and passing other member's ideas off as his own. When Frantz and Weymouth scored a major hit with their own side project Tom Tom Club, he describes the resentment Byrne felt towards them. He also highlights Byrne's awkwardness in several social situations. I felt Frantz was a bit harsh on Byrne overall. He gives him little credit for being such a brilliant frontman, and makes no allowances for Byrne's autism.Frantz's memoir provides an intriguing glimpse of the New York music scene in the late 70s, and he's not afraid to name drop. He talks about hanging out with Debbie Harry and Patti Smith at CBGBs, visits to Lou Reed's apartment, meetings with Andy Warhol. He describes life on tour with The Ramones (he's not a fan of Johnny) and XTC. He gives an insight into what it was like filming the legendary concert film Stop Making Sense. Most of all, I enjoyed his tales of recording albums in the Caribbean, the ill-fated production of the Happy Mondays' Yes Please! being a particular highlight. I knew the Manchester band were wild but I had no idea they were this level of crazy.However, while the book often fascinating, it's not very well-written.

A couple of years ago, I heard her speak at an eI was a huge fan of Patricia Lockwood's memoir Priestdaddy, a book I have recommended to many people. A couple of years ago, I heard her speak at an event in Dublin with Sally Rooney and thought she was hilarious. So I was eager to get stuck into her debut novel, especially when I heard that it addressed internet culture, a topic she clearly knows a lot about.The book is divided into two parts. In the first, the protagonist has achieved fame via a viral post that reads: ""Can a dog be twins?"". She travels the world on the back of this and other humorous tweets, speaking about the internet (or ""the portal"" as she refers to it) on panels and at conferences. In the second part, the woman is urged to return to her family home, where her sister is experiencing pregnancy complications.The first half may test the reader's patience. How much you get out of it probably depends on how internet savvy you are. There are a lot in-jokes and references to popular memes. As an avid Twitter user myself, I found it funny and clever, though perhaps there was a lack of heft to this part of the novel. It's more like a collection of witty observations about social media, such as the sheer absurdity of it all:""As she began to type, “Enormous fatberg made of grease, wet wipes, and condoms is terrorizing London’s sewers,” her hands began to waver in their outlines and she had to rock the crown of her head against the cool wall, back and forth, back and forth. What, in place of these sentences, marched in the brains of previous generations? Folk rhymes about planting turnips, she guessed.""Or how the Twitter mob decides on its next victim: ""Every day their attention must turn, like the shine on a school of fish, all at once, toward a new person to hate. Sometimes the subject was a war criminal, but other times it was someone who made a heinous substitution in guacamole. It was not so much the hatred she was interested in as the swift attenuation, as if their collective blood had made a decision.""Or how addictive the Internet can become:""When she was away from it, it was not just like being away from a body, but a warm body that wanted her. The way, when she was gone from it, she thought so longingly of My information. Oh, my answers. Oh, my everything I never knew I needed to know. Everything changes in the second part. The family heartache that befalls the protagonist gives the story an emotional core. It causes her to reexamine her life. However, while she begins to grasp the insignificance of the internet in the grand scheme of things, silly Twitter jokes are still sent between the narrator and her sister as a way of coping with their situation. It's OK for both worlds to co-exist, Lockwood seems to be saying. Without giving too much away, I found the second half of the story incredibly moving. Lockwood writes so beautifully about the main character's love for her little niece and the world she is so eager for her to experience: ""The things she wanted the baby to know seemed small, so small. How it felt to go to a grocery store on vacation; to wake at three a.m. and run your whole life through your fingertips; first library card; new lipstick; a toe going numb for two months because you wore borrowed shoes to a friend’s wedding; Thursday; October; “She’s Like the Wind” in a dentist’s office; driver’s license picture where you look like a killer; getting your bathing suit back on after you go to the bathroom; touching a cymbal for sound and then touching it again for silence; playing house in the refrigerator box; letting a match burn down to the fingerprints; one hand in the Scrabble bag and then I I I O U E A; eyes racing to the end of Villette (skip the parts about the crétin, sweetheart), hamburger wrappers on a road trip; the twist of a heavy red apple in an orchard; word on the tip of the tongue; the portal, but just for a minute.""If I do have some slight reservations about the book, it's with the first half. The nature of its fragmented commentary on social media may put some readers off and it's possible the cultural references contained within will date rapidly. But the devastating second half elevates the story into something profound, putting the protagonist's earlier carefree existence and trivial concerns into context. I experienced lots of emotions reading this book: it made me laugh, it brought a tear to my eye, and it made me grateful that we have writers as poetic and incisive as Patricia Lockwood, who can make sense of this modern world and all its madness....more",Notes are private!,0,64,1,"Jan 05, 2021","Jan 10, 2021","Jan 05, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53733106-no-one-is-talking-about-this

William Stoner has spent all nineteen years of his life on the family's meagre farm, when his father suggests that he study agriculture at the university in nearby Columbia. Daunted by his change of circumstance, Stoner initially struggles on campus, passing his exams but not making many friends. The situation alters in his second year, when he takes an English class and falls in love with literature. Encouraged by his mentor Archer Sloane, Stoner becomes a teacher. Not long after, he is smitten with a girl that he meets at a party, and they soon wed. But he quickly realises that they are incompatible and the marriage is under strain from the start. Stoner goes on to live a quiet, mostly uneventful life, not remembered by many of his colleagues but respected by the few that do.If you're looking for thrills and spills, Stoner is not the book for you. It's a thoughtful, meditative story of an uncomplicated existence. It's also quite a sad story - Stoner ends up with more than a few regrets: his loveless marriage, the distant connection with his daughter. His relationship with his parents moved me most of all - the scene where he graduates and tells them that he is not returning to the farm absolutely broke my heart. I can certainly see why this novel is so admired - it may not be action-packed, but it's a wise, poignant, beautifully constructed account of an ordinary life.Favourite quotes:""In his extreme youth Stoner had thought of love as an absolute state of being to which, if one were lucky, one might find access; in his maturity he had decided it was the heaven of a false religion, toward which one ought to gaze with an amused disbelief, a gently familiar contempt, and an embarrassed nostalgia. Now in his middle age he began to know that it was neither a state of grace nor an illusion; he saw it as a human act of becoming, a condition that was invented and modified moment by moment and day by day, by the will and the intelligence and the heart.""""For a few moments in the evening, then, they talked quietly and casually, as if they were old friends or exhausted enemies.""""He listened to his words fall as if from the mouth of another, and watched his father’s face, which received those words as a stone receives the repeated blows of a fist.""""He had come to that moment in his age when there occurred to him, with increasing intensity, a question of such overwhelming simplicity that he had no means to face it. He found himself wondering if his life were worth the living; if it had ever been. It was a question, he suspected, that came to all men at one time or another; he wondered if it came to them with such impersonal force as it came to him. The question brought with it a sadness, but it was a general sadness which (he thought) had little to do with himself or with his particular fate; he was not even sure that the question sprang from the most immediate and obvious causes, from what his own life had become.""...more",Notes are private!,0,60,1,"Dec 31, 2020","Jan 03, 2021","Dec 31, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/166997.Stoner

I probably prefer reading about them than listening to them, being as culturally significant as they are. And this book, which won the 2020 Baillie Gifford Prize for Non-Fiction, is the best thing I've read about them in some time.It's comprised of 150 short chapters, offering glimpses of the band at different points in their history. It is not meant to be an exhaustive study but it is put together in a way that keeps the reader enthralled - a mixture of interviews, fan letters, autobiography and much more. Above all, it gives an idea of what it must have been like to live through the most thrilling era of pop music, with an inside view of the most important band that ever existed.What I loved most about the book was the stories of figures peripheral to the group, many of whom have been lost to the annals of time. We've all heard of Pete Best, but how about Jimmie Nicol, who took over as drummer for ten days when Ringo was sick? The brief taste of fame ruined his life and he spent the rest of his existence trying to recapture that thrill. Or McCall and Brill, a comedy duo whose big break on the Ed Sullivan Show was completely overshadowed by the first US appearance of the Fab Four. Another story I found compelling was that of Alexis Mardas, a shyster who convinced John that he was a technological wizard. He ended up as head of Apple Electronics and squandered a fortune on hare-brained schemes.The personalities of the band shine through in all of the tales that are told. Paul (my favourite, and I suspect the author's) comes across quite well: a thoughtful, genial sort, though he could be bossy and controlling. John is the caustic wit, a troubled genius, though there are hints at a softer side in his love for his Aunt Mimi. George doesn't score quite as highly: he is the quiet, shy Beatle, moody in a lot of these vignettes. And Ringo just seems happy to be there, counting his lucky stars.It really is a joy to read - the chapters are so snappy that you're never waiting too long for the next fascinating anecdote. Craig Brown writes with a terrific sense of humour, but above all else he is a true fan and his lifelong admiration for the band is never in doubt. Critics might argue that with all that has been written about The Beatles, there is nothing new here.

But what really gets his motor running (pardon the pun) is working as a getaway driver, and he's damn good at it too. It runs in the family: his father was the best in the business before he ran out on him and his Mom, many years ago, and he stills remembers his old man as a legend. Beauregard has tried to put his criminal past behind him - these days he lives a quieter life with his girlfriend and two young sons. However, the bills are piling up and he's in danger of losing the shop. When the opportunity of a lucrative diamond heist comes his way, he decides that it's too good to turn down. Even though it means teaming up with the shady Ronnie Sessions, this one final scheme can solve all of his financial woes. Or so he tells himself.

But it succeeds: the dialogue is snappy, the twists keep coming, and Beauregard is the anti-hero you can't help rooting for. Even though he's a felon, he's got principles.

Anyway, Human Croquet is one that had passed me by until now. It doesn't seem to be talked about as much as her other novels, but I reckon it's up there with some of her best work.16-year-old Isobel Fairfax is our narrator. She lives with her family in the run-down Fairfax Manor, located in Lythe, a village in the North of England. And quite a dysfunctional family it is. Her brother Charles is obsessed with alien abductions, while bad-tempered Aunt Vinny shares her bedroom with a herd of cats. Eliza, Isobel's mother went missing went she was a child, and her and Charles have never truly recovered from this. They search the house for mementoes of her, anything that can unlock precious memories. Her father Gordon has taken a second wife, but Isobel is not very keen on her. She still clings to a hope that her dear mother might someday return. But strangest of all, Isobel seems to have developed the ability to time travel - visions of past Lythe appear to her while see is out walking. What could it all mean?I think the reason the story works so well is down to the voice of Isobel. She's an intelligent, witty girl, but self-critical and lonely. She has a huge crush on Malcolm, one of her school-friends, and you root for her to win him over. But I also enjoyed the mysteries of the plot - the riddle of Eliza is one thing, but the apparitions Isobel experiences left me scratching my head in wonder.When the answer to this arrives, it seems so obvious, and I was kicking myself that I hadn't figured it out.

Smarting from a doomed affair with a married man, and another mysterious event, she is advised by friends to take a vacation in order to recover. Arriving at the Swiss Hotel du Lac in a state of confusion, she is unsure of what to do next. She becomes involved in the pursuits of other guests, such as the wealthy Mrs Pusey and her daughter Jennifer, and Monica, a woman struggling with an eating disorder. Edith can't help writing letters to David, her lover, even though she knows that she's getting much more out of their illicit relationship than he is. But during her stay at this quiet hotel, she is offered a glimpse of another existence, and she must quickly decide whether or not to take it.From what I can gather, this novel was a surprise winner of the Booker Prize in 1984, beating efforts from the likes of J.G. Ballard and Julian Barnes. I have also heard that it is not Brookner's best work and I'm afraid I didn't get a whole lot out of it. My main problem is that I never really warmed to Edith as a character. She is so passive and during her hotel stay, she just seems to let things happen to her.

But there are things you know at eighteen that you will never know again.""This sad, nostalgic tale has an interesting structure. The first half is set in 1986, where a gang of rowdy Scottish teenagers head to Manchester for an unforgettable gig. The second half happens several years later, when one of the group receives some tragic news.Out of all of them, our narrator James and the charismatic Tully are the closest. James, a thoughtful, bookish sort, comes from a broken home, but Tully takes him in and the family treat him as one of their own. The boys are on the cusp of adulthood when we first encounter them, beginning to think about their future. Tully is the more cynical of the two but he encourages his intelligent pal to dream big. All that is set to one side for the matter of the big trip to Manchester. The pair travel south with their mates - drinking, quoting their favourite films and chasing girls. Though they might not realise it at the time, this is the best weekend of their lives.The mood changes dramatically in the second half. James and Tully are still close, but a devastating blow changes their whole dynamic. They reminisce about the old days, sad that they are long gone, but thankful for all the happy memories. With a heavy heart, James agrees to carry out one last favour for his old pal.Mayflies is a paean to carefree adolescence and at the same time, a cautionary tale of the way time creeps up on all of us. Most of all though, it's an ode to true friendship: the kind that endures, whatever bliss or heartache life brings.

In The CoaFor my money, Kevin Barry is the finest Irish writer of his generation, and the first story in his latest collection backs up my theory. In The Coast of Leitrim, a lonely man, who sees himself as far more cultured than his peers, develops a crush on a waitress at the local café. It contains the perfect blend of humour and romance, with hints of a darker obsession thrown in. The last line is a triumph.The rest of the stories don't quite scale the same peaks, but there are plenty of highlights. Old Stock tells of a writer who inherits a Donegal cottage from an uncle, finding that his new lifestyle makes him irresistible to the ladies. Ox Mountain Death Song plays like an Irish Western - a dogged sergeant and an unrepentant criminal end their epic battle in a final showdown. The old man in Who's-Dead McCarthy has unhealthy fascination with death, verging on the comical. The only effort that didn't really work for me was Roethke in the Bughouse, an ambitious attempt to capture the American poet's mental state during a breakdown in a Ballinasloe hospital.Throughout the collection, Barry proves a rare ability to capture the thrills and heartaches of rural Irish life, shot through with a black comedy that is pitched at just the right level. He is a true master of the short story and I can't wait for his next anthology.Favourite Quotes:""He had the misfortune in life to be fastidious and to own a delicacy of feeling.

In fact, already in his life he had borne plenty. He could handle just about anything, he felt, shy of a happy outcome. As the summer aged he became unseated by her trust of him and by her apparent want for him. What kind of a maniac could fall for the likes of me, he wondered. The question was unanswerable and terrifying.""""The pale-green days of these Atlantic reaches could be enlivened only by fucking and fighting - moments of violent glow - and the Canavan magic was to make sparks from little.""""The caves at Keash Hill were no more than a fifty-minute haul from the Ox Mountains and there lay the remnants of elk, wolves, bear. It was a place haunted by desperate mammals since the hills and mountains had cracked and opened—as the province of Connaught formed—a place with a diabolic feeling sometimes along its shale and bracken stretches; a darkness that seeped not from above but from beneath.""""At my age - I had long since cleared the vault of fifty - it was not unreasonable to assume that this might have been my last great love.

But it's really a framework for Sigrid Nunez to examine certain topics in her typically perceptive manner: mortality, old age and grief among many others.The dying woman has a daughter but they are not on the best of terms. Hence the reason our narrator is enlisted. She agrees as she feels as though she can't let her friend down, but as the time approaches, pressure begins to build. The practicalities of it alone are difficult to process. Should they be in the same room when it happens? What does she tell the police when she phones to report the death? The pair travel to a beautiful Airbnb in the countryside to carry out the plan, but things don't pan out the way they expect.It's written in a casual, almost conversational style but it asks tough questions. Is it wrong to help end a friend's suffering? Is a parent allowed to admit that they don't love their child? Is it selfish to bring a baby into a world where there is so much torment?

He has always struck me as a kind and compassionate writer, so it's no surprise to see evPatrick Freyne is a features journalist for the Irish Times. He has always struck me as a kind and compassionate writer, so it's no surprise to see evidence of these attributes in this memoir-style collection.There are two types of essay in the book. The first contain Sedaris-esque attempts at humour, such as memories from childhood and having a military man for a father. I'm afraid these pieces didn't work so well for me - I just didn't find them all that interesting or funny. Though the book's blurb does contain praise from the likes of Joseph O'Connor and Marian Keyes, hailing Freyne as a comic genius. I suppose it comes down to the reader's sense of humour. (This must make me sound like I don't have any!)I much preferred the more heartfelt pieces, where Freyne's empathy comes to the fore. Sing a New Song to Drive the Sorrows Away talks about the simple joy of singing. Freyne used to be a member of a rock band, but these days he organizes regular singing nights with his wife and friends and it fills him with happiness. I love music too and I find it hard to describe the way it makes me feel, but I think he does a pretty good job of it:  ""I don't know why singing makes me cry. But I think it's because when we construct a song from the air with our memories and lungs and mouths, I feel connected to other people in a way I struggle with otherwise. I like losing myself in the thickets of othe people's voices, in my friends' voices. We're people in middle age and life has happened to us: bereavement, separation, children, no children, ill health, redundancy, pain. Sometimes you can hear it in the way we sing.""The subject of parenthood comes up again in Something Else. Freyne describes the delight of being in the company of his nephews and nieces, but he also mentions that, for him and his wife, having children would be very complicated. His anxiety at missing out on a fundamental aspect of life is something that really chimes with me, as an ageing singleton: ""At my most vulnerable, I worry that being without children makes me an un-important non-person. I worry that I'm going to get weird, that not having a feedback loop of care with a smaller human is going to cause my heart and soul to shrivel up. I worry that we were put here on Earth to be people-makers and that if I don't get on with that task I'll lose my membership card for the human race. And I worry that having children grants people access to some big secret that's denied to the rest of us.""The standout essay in the book is Care, about Freyne's previous job as care-worker. It's a beautiful piece of writing, full of thoughtful paragraphs that left me nodding my head in agreement: ""Young men from backgrounds like mine are encouraged to be ambitious and clever, and, maybe, in a slightly detached way, to be kind. We're taught abstract notions like 'ethics.' But we're not conditioned to nurture or care. The most socially respectable approach to care for the middle classes is to earn enough money to pay other people to do it. So, with all that in mind, it's a beautiful thing when you realize that it's something you can do: to physically care for a stranger.""The job involved working with intellectually disabled adults and was not without its challenges, but there were also times when its rewards were priceless: ""For every day that I drove home from work with scratches and bruises, feeling like I'd earned my wages, there'd be another where I had experienced the simple force of someone else's love and it felt like I had stolen something.""The best thing about the book is that it's so wide-ranging, there is something for everyone. If a particular essay doesn't tickle your fancy, the next one surely will. Freyne's talent is in no doubt and he comes across as a very likeable human being indeed....more",Notes are private!,0,32,1,"Oct 13, 2020","Oct 19, 2020","Oct 13, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/52842919-ok-let-s-do-your-stupid-idea

James O'Connor is an Irishman in the local police force, transferred from Dublin in the hope of escaping grief and a serious drinking problem. O'Connor has an informer in the Brotherhood and learns that they have hired Stephen Doyle, a bloodthirsty US Civil War soldier, to exact revenge for the hangings. Matters are complicated further by the arrival of O'Connor's nephew, Michael Sullivan, who claims to have met Doyle on the boat from New York. When O'Connor is beaten one night and his notes on the investigation taken, the situation threatens to spiral out of all control.

He is haunted by her memory, yet he knows that there is also a fate worse than this: ""It is painful to remember her still so alive, the press of her hand on his shoulder and the pale part of her coal black hair, but the thought that one day that pain might fade or disappear completely is worse.

I encountered no real surprises for the majority of the story, but the third act took an unusual and welcome turn.

It was published to a slew of positive s and selected by Oprah's influential Book Club. But a higher profile brought a greater level of scrutiny, and the book was heavily criticised by Latinx readers, calling out its lazy stereotypes and multiple inaccuracies.In the novel's Author's Note, Cummins does her best to address the charges of cultural appropriation. She acknowledges that as a non-migrant and non-Mexican, she might not be the most qualified person to have written this story. But she felt strongly about the mistreatment of Latino migrants in the US and wanted to highlight their struggle.

Desiree is lively and extroverted, while Stella is more studious and reserved. When they were little, they watched as their father was dragged from their house and lynched. They see no future for themselves in this racially-charged backwater, and so after turning sixteen, they run away to New Orleans. Fourteen years later Desiree returns to Mallard with a young daughter, Jude. Stella has apparently disappeared from the face of the earth. Time passes and Desiree despairs - there is neither sight nor sound of her sister. As Jude grows older she shows promise as an athlete, winning a scholarship to UCLA. She takes on a catering job to earn some extra money and while working at a party one night, she sees a lady that looks exactly her mother. The thing is, this woman is white. It couldn't be, could it?This is a compelling story of race and family in a changing America. It taught me what it must feel like to have a twin, to have such a profound connection with a person that knows the same obstacles and struggles as you do. And what a wrench it must seem to have that bond taken away, almost like losing a part of yourself. The book tackles race in such a nuanced, thoughtful way - Stella understands that identifying as white will give her a chance at a better life, though she also realises the enormous sacrifices it will incur. But all of these characters, not just Stella, are trying to find their place in the world. That's what gives the story weight, and why it is so affecting. It's a genuinely moving and thought-provoking family saga.Favourite Quotes:  ""“The folks she come from,” he said. “Your mama still got some of that in her. She still think she better than us.” She didn’t understand exactly what he meant, but she liked being part of an us. People thought that being one of a kind made you special. No, it just made you lonely. What was special was belonging with someone else.""""“What could be better than being eighteen and in love? Oh, you don’t even know. If I could go back, I’d do everything different.”“Like what?” she said. “Oh, everything.” He turned back to the mirror. “This big ol’ world and we only get to go through it once. The saddest thing there is, you ask me.”""""She had become white because it was practical, so practical that, at the time, her decision seemed laughably obvious. Why wouldn’t you be white if you could be? Remaining what you were or becoming something new, it was all a choice, any way you looked at it. She had just made the rational decision.""""So she understood why her daughter was searching for a self, and she even blamed herself for it. Maybe something in the girl was unsettled, a small part of her realizing that her life wasn’t right. As if she’d gotten older and started touching the trees, only to find that they were all cardboard sets.""""Sometimes being a twin had felt like living with another version of yourself. That person existed for everyone, probably, an alternative self that lived only in the mind. But hers was real. Stella rolled over in bed each morning and looked into her eyes. Other times it felt like living with a foreigner. Why are you not more like me? she’d think, glancing over at Desiree. How did I become me and you become you? Maybe she was only quiet because Desiree was not. Maybe they’d spent their lives together modulating each other, making up for what the other lacked.""...more",Notes are private!,0,45,1,"Sep 07, 2020","Sep 13, 2020","Sep 07, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51791252-the-vanishing-half

(hide spoiler)]I'm willing to suspend belief when reading fiction. I know that sometimes, unlikely events need to happen in order to advance the plot. But this was a stretch too far for me. And the thing is, the characters don't even remark upon the highly improbable fluke of it all. Even if one of them had said something like ""What are the chances?"", I might be prepared to cut the book some slack. But they all carry on like it's the most natural thing in the world.Leaving that aside, the story itself is interesting enough. It takes a modern look at topics like class, race and white guilt. And it moves at a quick pace to hold the reader's attention. However, I'm a bit mystified as to the gushing praise it has received. I don't think it's anywhere near as 'intricate' or 'carefully observed' as some publications have claimed. It was lucky enough to come along at the right time and rode a wave of media hype. And lots of folk seem to have enjoyed it.

American cities have become overcrowded, consuming massive amounts resources, so that there only one area of untouched terrain left. Twenty volunteers choose to take part in an experiment, to see how they can survive in this ""Wilderness state"". They have minimal possessions and are allowed to hunt & forage, but they must leave no trace of themselves behind. They are expected to follow rules laid out in a manual, while Rangers watch their movements. Among this community are Bea and Agnes, a mother and daughter. Agnes was very sick as a child in the city, and Bea brought her on this study in the desperate hope that her health would improve. She has thrived and taken to this new life in a positive way, picking up many valuable skills. Bea on the other hand misses her old life and finds herself becoming a reluctant leader of the group. The story follows the community's struggle to survive, as they drift farther from the guidelines set out for them.I'm afraid this novel moved too slowly for me to enjoy it. Especially at the beginning, it takes such a long time to get going. It seems like there are endless descriptions of the landscape. Eventually the mother-daughter friction starts to get interesting, but I'm afraid it will have lost many readers by that point. It is a very timely tale, addressing an urgent topic like climate change in a thoughtful way. And its portrayal of maternal love is quite moving at times. I just wish the book's editor had cut about a hundred pages from it. With some tightening up, it could have been a much more effective parable....more",Notes are private!,0,43,1,"Aug 24, 2020","Aug 30, 2020","Aug 24, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/48836769-the-new-wilderness

Yes it's bleak, but it's a completely engrossing story of a boy's love for his mother. A remarkable debut from Douglas Stuart.We begin in 1992. 15-year-old Shuggie Bain is living in a grim bedsit, doing his best to avoid the advances of the creepy old man in the room next door. The story then flashes back a decade earlier. A tiny high-rise apartment houses the Bain family, in a downtrodden part of Glasgow. Shuggie's father Hugh (nicknamed Big Shug) drives a taxi at night, and has an eye for the ladies. His mother Agnes has a drinking problem, which tends to get worse when she suspects her husband's philandering. Catherine and Leek, Shuggie's older siblings, tend to avoid the flat when their mother is one of her benders. However, little Shuggie has no option but to stay at home. There is one ray of hope: Hugh has secured a house on the outskirts of Glasgow, where the family will have more space and a front door of their own. A chance at a fresh start, Agnes tells herself. But the move ends up posing a new set of problems to the Bains.The story paints a sorry picture of 80s Glasgow. It's a city on its knees, crippled by unemployment and an uncaring Tory government. Shug watches it through his taxi windscreen and doesn't like what he sees:""The city was changing; he could see it in people’s faces. Glasgow was losing its purpose, and he could see it all clearly from behind the glass. He could feel it in his takings. He had heard them say that Thatcher didn’t want honest workers any more; her future was technology and nuclear power and private health. Industrial days were over, and the bones of the Clyde Shipworks and the Springburn Railworks lay about the city like rotted dinosaurs. Whole housing estates of young men who were promised the working trades of their fathers had no future now. Men were losing their very masculinity.""Though the title bears Shuggie's name, the story is really about Agnes. Her alcoholism worsens with every disappointment that life brings. She's a good-looking woman and has always felt that she deserved more than her unhappy existence. Leek understands that this frustration drives his mother. When he comes home filthy from the quarry, she's not cross with him for hanging around in such a dangerous place, it's for showing her up: ""It was the dust that bothered Agnes. It was what the neighbours must think when they saw him come back covered in soot and dirt. How she could no longer pretend that she was nothing like them, that she was better born and stuck only temporarily in their forgotten corner of misery. It was pride, not danger, that made her so angry.""What's most moving of all is the unconditional love Shuggie has for Agnes, even after all the torture she has put him through. Cleaning the vomit from her face after another heavy night's drinking. Going hungry again because she has spent all of their money on beer and vodka. The absolute terror that she will eventually kill herself. These are all things a child should never have to experience, but Shuggie still believes that nobody can compare to his Mammy: ""She was no use at maths homework, and some days you could starve rather than get a hot meal from her, but Shuggie looked at her now and understood this was where she excelled. Everyday with the make-up on and her hair done, she climbed out of her grave and held her head high. When she had disgraced herself with drink, she got up the next day, put on her best coat, and faced the world. When her belly was empty and her weans were hungry, she did her hair and let the world think otherwise."" It's a heart-wrenching story, and it brought me close to tears on many occasions. You can't help rooting for these characters, even for Agnes in all her vanity and self-destruction, willing her to give AA just one more try. And the first line of the book's acknowledgements might be the most poignant sentence of all. A magnificent novel, told with unflinching honesty and profound emotion....more",Notes are private!,0,64,1,"Aug 17, 2020","Aug 23, 2020","Aug 17, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52741293-shuggie-bain

It tells an important story and I learned quite a bit from reading it, but its fragmented structure prevented me from properly engaging with it.The book revolves around Rami and Bassam, an Israeli and a Palestinian respectively, who have both lost a daughter as a result of the conflict between their nations. Though the men are on opposing sides, they become friends and advocates for peace in the region. We are given their backstories. Rami was a member of the Israeli military, later becoming a graphic designer. Bassam served time in prison for resisting Israeli occupation, and during his internment he became a believer in the power of action through non-violent means. They remember the moments of horror, when their innocent children were taken long before their time was due. The two men, united in heartbreak, set about improving the relationships between their countries through meaningful dialogue.The story is told in 1001 segments, some that go on for several pages, some that are as a short as a sentence. They veer off on various tangents, such as the migratory habits of birds, the manufacture of bullets, the high-wire artist Phillipe Petit and so on. They are all loosely connected to the main story and McCann always returns to this central tale of Rami and Bassam. But this fragmented account only served to pull me out of concentrating on the men's plight. Some of the segments were interesting, though to be honest they were more of a distraction than anything else. I'm all for experimenting with forms of narrative - however in this case, it didn't work for me.Where the book does succeed is in its examination of grief, and its sensitive, nuanced exploration of a complex political conflict. It's a daring effort, and while it might not entirely succeed in its ambition, it has a moving and hopeful story at its heart....more",Notes are private!,0,42,1,"Aug 10, 2020","Aug 16, 2020","Aug 10, 2020",,Audio CD,view (with text),/book/show/50732671-apeirogon

He lives each day to a strict routine, heading out for a run at 7.15, starting work at 10.00 and assigning cleaning chores to himself, which are never missed. Even his relationship with girlfriend Cass is quite regimented - she lives at her own place and certain boundaries are very clear. Micah's family, loud and disorganised, are the complete opposite of his personality and tease him about his carefully-ordered existence. Things change when the son of an old flame turns up on his doorstep, believing Micah to be his father. This sets in motion a change of events that cause Micah to question his lot and whether he really is happy with staying in his comfort zone.I've read Anne Tyler before, The Accidental Tourist being a particular favourite. I wasn't that keen on A Spool of Blue Thread, my last encounter with her. This sits somewhere in between the two, if you ask me. She is still a keen observer of human behaviour - you gradually understand why Micah has turned out this way, living a distanced, controlled life (especially after meeting his rambunctious family.)
