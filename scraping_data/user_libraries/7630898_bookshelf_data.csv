Though short in length, it is a beautiful book that I will not forget. It is hard to believe that this is Ms. O'Connor's debut novel as she writes like a master. The narrative is from the perspective of Manod, an 18 year old girl/woman, living on a remote island off the coast of Wales. The year is 1938, just prior to WWII. The approximately 50 people who reside on the island live very differently from those on the mainland. Their clothes are at least a decade behind current fashions, and some are even from the last century. Their knowledge of the outside world is quite limited, and most of them accept traditional male and female roles. The men fish while the women gather plants, help with the catch, keep house and raise children.Manod lives with her father and younger sister. They have a dog named Elis and I found it peculiar that Manod's father often called her by the dog's name. Manod is responsible for her sister as their mother is dead. From descriptions of Manod's sister, it is possible she is on the autism spectrum.One day a whale washes to shore and, over time, rots. The stench is overwhelming and the birds and other animals peck and dig at its flesh. The children write on the whale and it is viewed as quite a curiosity. Shortly after the whale beaches, two ethnographers come to the Island. They are very impressed with Manod as she speaks and writes both Welsh and English, They hire her to translate their interviews with the island's inhabitants and she also does some secretarial work. Their names are Joan and Edward. Joan, at first, is enamored of Manod's intelligence and curiosity. However, they soon become mired in misunderstandings. Manod feels an erotic attraction to Edward but is unsure how to act. He arranges to spend time alone with her and their relationship becomes subtly erotic. With the arrival of the ethnographers, Manod's understanding of the world widens and she longs to go with them when they leave. Her dream is to go to the mainland and get an education. She never thought it was possible for her until Joan told her that women, too, can get higher education.This book was stellar and the poetic style of the narrative drew me in from the beginning. I thank NetGalley and Pantheon for allowing me access to an early  copy. I highly recommend this book!...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Apr 03, 2024","Apr 05, 2024","Apr 06, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/195888522-whale-fall

In no way does 'Bear' come up to the brilliance of Ms. 'Bear', by Julia Phillips, is very, very different from her first novel, 'Disappearing Earth'. In no way does 'Bear' come up to the brilliance of Ms. Phillips' debut novel. The characterizations are weak and their inner lives are obscure and barely of interest. Some of the narrative is sensational and buried in myth but I wasn't able to feel a connection to either of the protagonists. The best part of this novel were the descriptions of the natural world on the island.'Bear' is told from Sam's point of view. She is Elena's 28 year old sister, the younger of the two. They are the third generation to live on several acres of beautiful land on San Juan Island, off the coast of Washington. Sam hopes with all her heart that one day she and Elena will escape this island and live a fuller life somewhere else. After all, Sam estimates that the land their old and falling down house is built upon is worth around $500,000. She also thinks that Elena shares her dream of escaping the island. The only thing holding them back is their mother, who is very ill. While they lovingly care for her, they also dream of how her death will set them free from this house and this puny life.Both sisters have jobs in the service industry. Sam works on the ferry, for a company that contracts with the Washington State Ferry system. Because she is employed by a contractor, she doesn't get any of the benefits that come with a state job. Elena is a waitress in a country club on their island.They are constantly in debt, trying to make payments for their mother's medical bills and their own costs of living. They can never catch up. What made it even worse, is they had to struggle through the pandemic when both the ferry system and the country club barely functioned.One day, off the side of the ferry, Sam sees a swimming bear that is headed towards her island. She is both enthralled and fearful. When they later see the bear in their yard, she is full of terror. Elena does not share Sam's fear. She becomes enamored of the bear and puts herself in dangerous circumstances just to be near the bear, her allegorical lover.I started getting bored by the novel somewhere near the middle. Usually when this happens, I don't finish the book. However, I crawled through this one, page after page, until the end. I had the end figured out but it still threw me for a loop.

Despite not having a graduate degree in library science, she was hired and has proven her worth. She is even thought of as the heart of the library. She has written several letters to famous author Harrison Riddle, inviting him to give a reading at the library, and she has even attained a grant to finance his visit. What a coup!One day, out of the blue, Maeve is called into her boss's office and told that a teenaged library patron named Libby has filed an abuse claim against her. Libby is a troubled teen and there are rumors that she set something on fire and had a relationship with one of her teachers. Libby is considered a Borderline Personality: impulsive, promiscuous, mercurial moods, elastic view of reality, etc. Maeve is astonished at the claim of abuse and vehemently proclaims her innocence. Shortly after this, Maeve is laid off, purportedly due to budget cuts, but Maeve can't help thinking she is being let go due to Libby's claim.Maeve flounders without her job. She is in a happy marriage but her husband travels a lot and is currently in Florida visiting his ill mother. Her daughter Paige, to Maeve's chagrin, won't be coming home this summer. The library continues on without her, and even when Harrison Riddles accepts the offer to give a reading at the library, it is easily forgotten that Maeve was the catalyst that got him there. How can Maeve find her center and once again feel fulfilled?Maeve is obsessed with Libby. At times she thinks she's a evil, and at other times she feels empathy for the very troubled girl. Maeve wonders (as do I) why the diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder is so freely given to females and not males. Maeve, in her obsession, often drives by the library looking for Libby. Why she does this is a mystery to her. Does she want to tell Libby she forgives her? Or does she want to connect with her in some way?This novel examines many discordant themes with depth and acuity. Maeve's character is well-woven and her thoughts, motives, conflicts and actions viewed with a close-up lens. All aspects of Maeve's character are explored, an aspect of this novel that I loved.

It is about what it means to discard and leave, both literally and emotionally. It is also about marriage, love, family and loyalty. Ultimately, it is the story of two lovers, one married and the other divorced. Warren and Sarah were college sweethearts. Sarah broke off their relationship prior to graduating because she thought Warren was too impulsive. When they randomly meet at an opera decades later, their affair is reignited.Warren is an architect in an unfulfilled marriage with a woman he proposed to for the wrong reasons. Sarah is a divorcee who is content with her profession as a museum exhibition coordinator. She has not had a serious relationship since her divorce. When Sarah and Warren meet again, their attraction is rekindled and they begin a serious and intimate affair almost immediately. Warren lives in Boston and Sarah lives a bit north of New York City so their time together is limited to weekends or when Warren can get away from home for a business meeting.Initially, I did not feel grounded in the novel but as it progressed I was seriously hooked. The love affair is related via each of their experiences and perspectives. As they fall more and more in love, Warren wants to end his marriage and be with Sarah. Is this possible for a man with a deep sense of loyalty and commitment?Both of them have adult children for whom they feel deep love. The meaning of family and vows play center stage in this narrative. Are we beholden to our vows and promises? Do we fulfill ourselves and our needs despite the fallout? What does it mean to be loyal, and to whom do we owe our loyalty?As Ms. Robinson tells us, marriage can be a fragile thread or a tightrope. All good marriages require work and commitment. Leaving is often done without deep consideration. ""The thing about absence is that it is always there."" It affects not only the one who leaves but the whole constellation of what is called family. And the leaving endures.As the narrative moves towards its denouement, the limits of love and loyalty become paramount. Will Sarah and Warren have a future together or will they be tested beyond the limits of their emotional endurance?...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Mar 13, 2024","Mar 16, 2024","Mar 13, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/150778780-leaving

'Absolution' is a novel that takes a close-up lens of the wives of soldiers just prior to, and during, the Vietnam War. The wives, for the most part, appear to be beholden to their spouses in a very patriarchal culture that was prevalent in the United States at that time. They rely on permission for most everything. Some of them secretly choose to escape their husband's approval and go out on there own. They all seek absolution by trying in some way to lesson the pain they view around them. They may visit hospitals, leper colonies, or give Barbie Dolls to the ill.The novel is epistolary, letters written by women to one another.

Despite being a follow-up, it can be readily enjoyed as a stand-alone. The novel takes place in the village of Ardnakelty in western Ireland. It is an unusually hot summer and there has been no rain for weeks. Everyone is restless.Cal Hooper, a retired Chicago detective, has chosen Ardnakelty for his retirement years. He is still very emotionally connected to Trey Reddy who is now a teenager, and he is continuing his affair with Lena, a local widow. Trey and Cal have a woodworking business and take commissions for furniture. The town is so small that everyone is aware of everyone else's business. Arriving unexpectedly in Ardnakelty is Johnny Reddy, Trey's long-absent n'eer-do-well father. His story is that he's been hobnobbing with the rich and famous in London but everyone knows that Johnny's stories can't be taken at face value. Interestingly, a London friend of Johnny's accompanies him to Ardnakelty. According to Johnny, his friend is a millionaire and has a gold mining proposition for the townsmen. He knows where there is gold because his grandmother hailed from this village and told him just where to dig. For just a small investment, each man can become rich. Gold fever and greed take over despite reservations about the accuracy of this stranger's plan.Meanwhile, Trey is seeking revenge for the 'disappearance' of her brother who she believes was murdered by some local men. She concocts a story that she believes will out her brother's murderers and distances herself from Cal and Lena. This is a literary novel that happens to include a murder. The characterizations and narrative are so engaging that I had trouble putting the book down. Ms. French's attunement to the ambience of Ardnakelty and her perspicacity in drawing the characters is stunning. The slow burning and langourous feeling of the book provides a sense of what it's like to be in Ardnakelty. I felt like I was living there myself. I highly recommend this novel to all readers who enjoy literary fiction spiced with a bit of intrigue....more",Notes are private!,2,6,1,"Mar 05, 2024","Mar 07, 2024","Mar 05, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/174156145-the-hunter

However, it can be read as a standalone book and I plan to revisit the series from the beginning.The novel opens in the early 1990's. CID Duffy is Catholic and has suffered through the Irish 'troubles' in Belfast for years. He's experienced all forms of terror- bombings, riots, assassinations, etc. He doesn't get into his vehicle without checking underneath it for bombs or other explosives. He and his partner Beth, along with their daughter Emma, have moved to Scotland to get away from the 'troubles'.Duffy is working on a case, one he hopes is his last full-time one. A 15. year-old traveller girl names Kat has disappeared and it looks suspiciously like murder. Some of his colleagues are not taking Kat's disappearance too seriously, Travellers are not important to them. Duffy, however, is determined to find Kat. He is hoping this will be his last full-time case so that he can move to part-time for three years and then retire with a pension,On top of Duffy's looking for Kat, he is managing an informant (double agent) who is very squirrelly.

This novel takes place in Athens, Georgia and the university located there. A young man student named Ethan is found dead in his room off campus, questionably by suicide, and there are rumors that he was sexually involved with his German Professor, Verena Sobek. This thriller/mystery is very intense. Marlitt Kaplan, once a police officer, but now disgraced and kicked off the force, is a research assistant for her father who is a professor. She decides to investigate Ethan's death. In order to get close to the source, she applies to be a roommate in Ethan's former dwelling with his two living roommates. She is accepted by them and moves into Ethan's former apartment.The novel is told from various points of view. There is the female goth roommate, the male narcissistic roommate, and Verena Sobek. Marlitt is sniffing around all of them, trying to find out what happened to Ethan. Was he hopelessly in love with Verena, then rejected by her so he took his life? Or was it something more onerous? Did someone want to kill Ethan and make it look like a suicide.I enjoyed the parts about the bored students, the uncaring professors, all the cheating that went on, and the spurious complaints about grades.Marlitt is an interesting protagonist. She is savvy about investigative work and misses her time on the force. However, she knows that she messed things up so much there that she can never be reinstated.

Though the book is short in length, it is deep and intense. The main theme running through all three stories is the unexpected emotional and physical violence delivered to women by men..The first story, and the book's title, is So Late in the Day. The protagonist is Cathal, an emotionally stingy and withholding man. He reflects on his prior relationship with Sabine and how it went wrong. Not only were there misunderstandings, but Cathal resented Sabine's expectation of mutual love and respect. Now that the relationship has ended, he villainizes her and revels in his perceived power. He has chosen denial in order to make himself look like the winner in this misguided relationship.The second story, A Long and Painful Death, is about a 39 year old woman who has been granted a residency for her writing at the Heinrich Boll house on Achill Island. She is interrupted by knocking at her door and reluctantly answers. It is an older man, a German professor, who is envious of her residency and whose presence makes her uncomfortable. Her personal space is violated and, after he leaves, she envisions giving him a long and painful death in her writing.The third story, Antarctica, is the most powerful and violent. A married woman with children tells her husband that she is going out of town to buy Christmas presents. Her intention, however, is to pick up an unknown man and have anonymous sex with him. What transpires had me transfixed and horrified.Claire Keegan is a brilliant writer. Her ability to display a situation without apparent drama, allows the reader to visualize and imagine what is communicated between the lines.

Lara, her husband, and her three young adult daughters are residing on the family orchard in Northern Michigan. The narrative is told from Lara's viewpoint and consists primarily of her daughters' wanting to know about her past life - especially her romantic involvement with the now famous actor, Peter Duke.Much of the story is about a summer stock stage production of 'Our Town' located in Michigan on Tom Lake. Lara is in her twenties and has been called upon to take the lead role after the original actress has decided to quit. On Lara's first day, she is greeted by a charismatic young man named Peter Duke. From their first meeting evolves a drawn-out romance and affair that leaves Lara much beholden to Peter's narcissistic view of himself. Lara is quite aware that her daughters want to know all the intimacies that she and Peter shared, but she is not ready to give out these details freely.It is understood that Lara once had a promising future in acting but she chose to give it up for what she considers her idyllic life as a mother and wife. Her daughters find this all hard to absorb and want to know every last bit about Laura's time with Peter and her involvement with the stage.The writing flows beautifully and the imagery is incandescent.

There isn't one false note.I have never read Our Town but that didn't stop me from loving this novel, nor did it prevent me from understanding what was transpiring. I learned a lot about stage production, acting, and actors.I especially loved how the author provided each of her daughters with a distinct and inimitable personality, all beloved to her and each other.

The narraThis novel is one of the best I've read about racism and the schisms in our society that separate people based on their color and ethnicity. The narrative starts out at a protest after a police shooting of a black unarmed teenager. The protest is attended by Grace Park, a Korean American, and Shawn Matthews, an African American. Both have fractured families and the protest triggers memories and feelings that are uncomfortable and tragic.Grace has grown up in a sheltered environment. She works in her father's pharmacy and is very close to her sister Miriam. Miriam hasn't spoken to their mother in over two years and the Park family harbors secrets that Grace is unaware of.Shawn Matthews lives with his aunt. His cousin Ray has been incarcerated in a federal penitentiary for many years and has just been released. Shawn has cared for Ray's children while he was in jail. What haunts Shawn is the shooting of his sister Ava ten years previously.The Matthews and Park families are integrally connected in ways that the reader becomes aware of as the narrative unwinds. Their connection is tragic and mirrors the destruction and horrors that racism brings to our country. Ms. Cha has written a novel that held me in its grips from the first page to the last. She writes with empathy, compassion and truth about a topic that is very difficult to approach with understanding. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jul 18, 2023","Jul 21, 2023","Jul 18, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43615778-your-house-will-pay

The narrative goes back and forth in time froGeraldine Brooks has written a resounding book about American horse racing in the deep south, 1850-1861. The narrative goes back and forth in time from the 1800's to the present and encompasses many themes - slavery, art, love, and horses.In the present time, Jess, an Australian osteologist, finds the bones of what she thinks is the greatest race horse of all time, Lexington. She is able to identify the horse because of its stature and an unusual bone growth on its head. Jess meets Theo, a Nigerian-American, who is studying the art of horses as his PhD dissertation. He finds a painting of a horse in his neighbor's trash which turns out to be an important piece of art. Slowly, Jess and Theo form a friendship that becomes a romantic attachment.In the 1800's, Jarret, a slave on a large southern plantation, becomes very close to a newborn foal who later turns out to be America's greatest race horse - Lexington. Jarrett is raised with his father but later sold to a very manipulative slave owner. However, throughout his life, and Lexington's, they remain bonded. Jarrett becomes a 'sort of' assistant to Thomas Scott, a painter, who does several portraits of Lexington and Jarrett. They form a friendship of sorts though it was unusual in those days for a white man to befriend a black slave.Meanwhile, in the present, Martha Jackson, an art gallery owner, comes into contact with a painting of a horse. Her gallery is known for showing contemporary painters like Jackson Pollack and horse portraits are not really her thing. She says she'll evaluate the painting as a favor to her house maid.All these people and themes are interwoven in 'Horse' and the narrative is fascinating and beautifully written. It was sad to read about the conditions of slavery and lack of any agency a slave had. I also was saddened about the way some horses were treated by their wealthy white owners who cared more about making money than caring for the health and well-being of their race horses.This is a book to savor. It blossoms as it moves into the second half. I rooted for Jarrett the whole time I was reading it and loved the characters of Theo and Jess. I highly recommend this novel to anyone who treasures literary and historical fiction....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jul 05, 2023","Jul 08, 2023","Jul 08, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59109077-horse

'Let Us Descend' is a historical novel with a lot of magicJesmyn Ward's newest novel is very different from her previous books, all of which I loved. 'Let Us Descend' is a historical novel with a lot of magical realism, myth, and spirituality at its core. It is a narrative of the horror of slavery told in the voice of a young female slave named Annis. Annis is the unacknowledged daughter of a white slave owner who raped her mother. Annis and her mother are bonded by love and, after Annis's mother is sold and transported north, Annis loses hope. The only things that sustain her are her memories of her mother and the stories her mother told of Annis's legacy from her warrior grandmother who was transported on a slave ship to the Americas.Annis calls upon spirits to help her after she is sold by her owner. She is marched in bondage, tied in ropes, from the Carolinas to New Orleans. Without food, water, or any nourishment, she is forced to go through swamps, forests, and cross rivers while shackled to the other slave women. At times, the spirits help Annis and at other times they appear to outrage her.I felt like the book's magical realism distanced me from the personal first person narrative. The writing is beautiful and poetic but the spiritual and mythological aspects of the novel didn't work that well for me..

He thinks it's a good idea to donate his money to any children that he may have fathered.As Miles searches for the nine 'children' that he fathered through his sperm donation, something very mysterious occurs. These children seem to have disappeared, to have run into bad luck, and it seems very suspicious. Where have the 9 children he fathered gone ?
