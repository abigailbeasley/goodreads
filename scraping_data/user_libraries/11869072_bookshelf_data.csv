In all the senses I can evaluate too. But the genre is more horror, psychological style than it is detecting in any genre form. It was taken totally unknown from the ""New"" shelf. Probably one of the only times my outcome is a 5 star read experience after such a simple ""like the cover"" gambit.But few readers will like this one as much as I did. EXCELLENT vocabulary. Anhedonic or ultramimetic? This author is a woman after my heart. Would Mylifeisart ever be a service website?This is REAL New York City. So I warn. And warn again. Because there ARE many there like Vivian who reside in Manhattan. Ones who also have all the answers yet not a morsel of their own core self-identity and/or self worth to surround. Sorrowfully true. Because they are always acting and 90% disconnected from ""other"". And purposely keep that so.I won't go long although I could. But this is very dark and centered on a mentally ill/ personality disordered woman. Who also happens to be an excellent live theater/ stage performances critic. It's written for Arts majors and those who have MFA's etc. Not practical applications people like I am. So I am shocked by my own appreciation. This novel is cruel and coarse. And very real. Think quite opposite of any type of cozy.Warning: foul and excelling language. Both. Dark and darkness uses of alcohol and other addictions. Pleasure gotten through pain. Escape from singular life and the personal by living as an actor or in make believe worlds. But all done in reverse. Or looking in instead of out? Or not? It IS in chronological order.I could NOT put it down. And the ending I only guessed about 10 pages before the end of the book.I sure wonder if this author will ever do other novels? IMHO, this perhaps is highly autobiographical. By a very, very brilliant woman. Hope she is not as sick as Vivian seems. But I'll not forget the name Soloski.

I enjoy most travelogues more, although I loved the places featured in this one.The author may be a great traveler but not a writer up to that equal. He rather tells more about the help he engenders along the way and the search questions to natives of these places than he does re the places themselves. It seems he wants to stress his own serendipity type of long term and slow (months given to this) type of travel. Other than the planned, appointed, scheduled type of travel most humans are able to complete presently.The areas of core interest re former Roman Empire roads was an excellent tale and observation onus for the book.

With a sister like Lydia supplying you such a life of top notch lodging and ultimate backing? I won't continue with the Are locale series even if they do translate further into English.

I've read one of the beginning novels for her other/ alternate Swedish isle locale series. This one is locateThis is her other series start (Are #1). I've read one of the beginning novels for her other/ alternate Swedish isle locale series. This one is located in Are which is a very outlier rural mountain village part of Sweden. (Glorious mansions have just been built. Think Aspen category residents in part.) The ski lifts park/ venues are gearing up within the treacherous beginning of a winter blizzard period. Weather is key here throughout- it is focus. Deep snow and more and more. I will remind that this is for a length of daylight (well sort of) of no more than 5-1/2 hours total length of sunlight (murky too) daily. So darkness to search? Nearly a constant factor as well.Missing Amanda (just 18 years old) cores. And also Hanna finding herself after a turn of events which in some ways just dismissed her inclusion in the Stockholm police force. So the beginning itself was done quite well. With Hanna in turmoil and out of her city, urban reality completely. And this is the core problem with all her books that I've read so far and with this one too. Good beginning and more than adequate going to excellent endings. All. But scattered progressions, at best- and way, way too much repetitive filler in between. Sten does that the most in her introduction books to a series. It makes them overlong and at points hard to come back to with enthusiasm. So most of the book read feels like a 3 star. Also, I am always flabbergasted by the Swedish law procedures and in/out (ok let's just go in here again now or switch jurisdictions etc.) ploys. Which would never, ever be allowed in so many other countries.Yes, we know Hanna has poor self-esteem and is a mess up. Over and over we need to read chapter after chapter of her self-defeating thoughts? More than 100 pages of that onus with breaks of minute inquiry in this book. But that is how Sten gets any character depth? Not a fan.Also her characters, almost all of them. And especially all the primes. Why are they so always with tempers or wanting instant revenge. They act more Sicilian than they do Swedish? Beats me. But for this book especially- that almost made it a 3 star. I only rounded it up for the spectacular locale feel and accurate death. Well done. I don't think I have approached the slow freeze done as well and it is rarely, rarely attempted. Not even in the Nordic noir or any genre on the whole. With that weather you would think it is as common as the strangling has become.Well- even her main men characters all have a screw loose and snap. And the women are 90% juvenile (tearing apart clothing or wrecking with vandalism every time a ""hurt"" or rejection comes home to register). At 30 or 40 something? Sounds like teenager moronic reaction to me. Adults I know are not so universally triggered so fast. Is she (Sten) doing that as a habit to make the ""morose"" Scandinavian in most other writers' of this genre dissolve? Regardless- not everyone is perfect (like Lydia in this tale) but people in such jobs (law/copper/lab etc.) are just not as apt to be so over the top emotional. I have known many and I can't think of a one who is. Maybe also a warning for the animal lovers because a dog suffers retribution in this one. Another emotional snapper character- UGH!Overlong in repetition, but a writer of place and season that is memorable. 3 stars for all else- but 4 for that alone. I didn't completely guess the correct perp as I did in her others. Everything is more complex in this one so the social onus stance (trafficking, migration etc.) becomes much wider. Overall this is extremely sad too. Even having a 3 month old baby is made to seem too much for any adult to overcome. I hated that. Also she gets in her usual Mother or Mother-in-Law despicable older woman in there as usual. Drinking is more than featured by all as well....more",Notes are private!,1,7,1,"Apr 03, 2024","Apr 06, 2024","Mar 27, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/60400625-hidden-in-snow

But I did round it up for the locale feel of Sandhamn Island and the isles around it. Also for Nora's story- as that one was highly pertinent to the modern era.But it was overlong and at least 1/2 of the middle portions needed less telling. Most especially within the 4 or 5 paragraph description of each place using nearly identical words to do so too. And also for Thomas's long winded surrounds or ferry or boating or walking portions to get to an inquiry or office space. But his workplace and associates were NOT overdone either, so the balance was off, IMHO. All else was (I cannot relate how many times the archipelago word in several forms or the same house flowers were again described and praised or at least noted) using page after page of little else but the very much alike description. And even after the third death a decent edit count and task could have scoured out at least 25 pages of the last third and it would have been a better book.Yet the ending made up for it. The last 40-50 pages were the full 4 stars. The stone tower and much else of the juxtapositions were done well.I will go on to book #2 and hope that the repetition habit becomes more cured as she publishes. And that she has better continuity- as this one had some points of huge jumpiness. And I did guess the correct murderer too just at about the half way point because of how that omitting ""jumping"" to others or Thomas's hierarchy was progressing.But I really do think she did Nora to a full 4 star level. Her thoughts, her activity, her sleep etc. with the 2 boys. That was very close to real life for this type of fiction genre. I'm a big fan of that aspect. Hope in book #2 that she does take the job in Malmo.It seems like nearly every one of these Scandinavian writers have characters that are orphans, family bereft, singles of dire happenstance etc. in majority. At least this one holds some people who have living parents, siblings who didn't all go to another continent or kids that are alive and/or at least talking to them. That was a plus for Still Waters.

There was hardly enough Sito biographical or personal information to be the core of the title. Most of the book was about himself and the Black teenagers in various other cities. Not only San Francisco. Not only now either; then or always. And the title is not ""answered"" at all within specifics but with more theory, IMHO.He uses this terrible outcome for page after page of his own former publications as advertisement and also in repeated copy stats. And one of them is filled with what is called in tech social media sites ""misinformation"". Because I was there in Chicago during the ""glory days"" of his associates. This interpretation of the Weathermen and Black Rangers/ Black Panthers Nation etc. etc. is highly inaccurate. Murderers and terrorists all. Some were jailed for life. Some lead rolls now as if they hadn't killed 3 or up to a dozen innocent people each. When that is only the tip of the iceberg for their depth of horrific deeds, at that.People who read this type of highly educated theory posited as if most of it IS biography or is true? Well, I wish I would have had a cell phone camera about 10 times in my life before I was 30. Because almost the entire Chicago portion was like Pontius Pilate relating the events of Jesus of Nazareth's Palm Sunday parade.At points he says teenagers of this placement and time period is like being a leopard. They have ""leopards"" inside them and they cannot help many emotional actions of various terrible results. When emotional actions lead to vast destruction, murders, life long disabilities from assaults, destruction of property to where it can never recover- or just plain evil outcomes when victims can no longer hold any trust- than I believe it IS the fault of the person who committed the act. Never explained as ""normal"" either.Here, once again, the option of little to no consequence is posited as the answer for these acts? With all police as the tyrants? Oh, of course.What is hardest to swallow is the educational levels of these parental or step-father etc. relations as they ARE described. Where were they when the kid was growing up?

If you have no tolerance for gross, foul, and crass language and/or comparisons to judgments made here that don't translate well after 2000 years? Well, you see what I mean? I bet there were more street words for sexual intercourse in this book than any other I've read. Well, I read in quantity- but not ones like those using such gutter language much. So anyone who had to listen to this (audio)? Bonking in 100 forms. F words used in/as every part of speech. Then why the rating?Well, I almost gave it a 5 star rating. Because she gets you into the times of Agrippina. The razor's edge that being a great-granddaughter of Augustus gets you. Among a place, culture, time that was intensely rule bound and hierarchy dictated. Southon uses modern media and entertainment ""knowns"" (by her generation raised in England anyway)- to exactly differentiate. And it is like the layers of an onion. Everything small? Not really, as it gets peeled back to reveal more. You do ""get it"". This was a time of such power and in /for women- not at all the same as the present. Even 200 years ago women were NOT so lawfully restricted to their own singular existences. They in the Roman Empire did not even hold a lawful voice at all- only a male relative could own, speak, decide for them.The critics of Southon are so turned about by the constant ""I"" talk in this book coupled with feminist modern observations that they fail to see the lack within the historic record. This is an excellence that Southon notes and displays well. Or do most ers of this truly grasp the entire manner of writing and record that was done in the centuries after Agrippina's life which required it. And not just about her or any Empress or power female figurer either- but about the base mindset of the historic writer himself or the common person of those times beliefs/truths re women and authority. Common beliefs often became truth for the long term. They do now too. When truth is the farthest reach (opposite) of what WAS or IS.Some of the political ""sides"" are just as projecting today (accusing deeds which they themselves do continually) as they were in Agrippina's life span. So many of those events or outcomes were distorted too by the recorders afterwards. The Roman cognition/emotion/definition being that men and women could never be associates or friends in purposes (both good and bad purposes) without sex being involved between them. Coming from an Italian culture which still sits there- I do understand. Other cultures are worse. That's true. Still is.Read the other s for this too. It IS (her life and her actions) much more complex than Game of Thrones. If you ever watched I, Claudius on PBS (ancient now- probably most of you were not even born then)- you might understand this better. What you saw is not always what you got. Also I think this gives you a taste of the real religious sense of that era. Omens, tradition, clothing to reflect etc. Excellent- 5 stars. If anything she underestimates the superstition of curses, spells, sacrifices etc. The numbers of executions and annihilating entire populations went way down during Agrippina's run as Empress and in her persuasions overall too. The numbers recorded were an excellent window seldom exposed. I've read tomes of Rome for 60 plus years. Never saw that before.If you do nothing and detest flippant and crass historic details? Although most certainly close to truth- at least read page 141 in the hard cover. It's a masterful reciting of what Roman Empire DID to the provinces. It tells you much. How Roman Empire and colonization methods HAVE/DID advance the world. Because the message in education now is totally the opposite. Roads and peace were the least of it. Longevity, shelter, trade, engineering (I could get verbose) etc. The part about the draining of the lake festival! OMG, this was 2000 years ago and they DID that without any heavy equipment or mechanical power machines. Just passing the bath habit and places was a millennia of progress in health/ disease etc. Agrippina was smart and many will like her. I did not. But I do think she walked such an edge that she lived up to being Germanicus's daughter. Having her entire birth family but 1 sister (9 or 10 people depending on the historian) killed or dead before she herself was in her 20's? Well, I wonder who of us could have done better. I differ from Southon in several opinions and have read Roman history. Too much is unknown- especially upon what happened right before Claudius was poisoned. If you love Roman power reads- this is one of the best. Nearly a 5 star read but not, IMHO, because of the style of telling; it becomes abhorrent at points. Although the similes to similar modern tv or brands etc. comparisons make it much easier to absorb than most dry history relating. Why it loses the one star, maybe more- is that she at points does as Zinn did in his history ""telling"". Slant the ""eyes"" to make modern values apply or omits things that don't ""fit"" for personal/ individual appraisals. Not as horribly off as Zinn because at least she does (not all the time but most times) state the opposing theory/ events which may have happened/ alliances/ REAL outcomes that do not jibe etc. Zinn never does. Also she left out no time periods in Agrippina's life. Not even the ones of near silence or exile.I read her second book. It was not as good as this one centered on Agrippina. But I still can see SOME of the lower star ratings for this tone. Of course, only men ever wrote the history and it was only within eyes of their own social constructs.

I read it slowly after reading Sarum by Rutherfurd which gives nearly the opposite views re the periods of the conquest of the English isle by the Romans. With oppressors being received more than the eyes of the elites themselves who conquer as here in A Rome of One's Own.Southon sure knows her history. And her best first sources too. But why she diverts into paragraph after paragraph to do stand up material? A reference to pop culture of more modern eras (almost exclusively her own, btw) in contrast or to equivocate is useful. Also fine when done cleverly and witty as she surely is. But not constantly and consistently. Most especially with huge blasts of foul verbiage and real attitude of ire thrown in. Not once, not twice, but often.So I was disappointed and did not enjoy the read very much. I can listen to cable tv drek and hear nearly the same phrasing. Women had different rules. That's a surety. Southon gives you every angle when they worked the least for the women themselves or were part of a whole world view of rules considered by current terms, despicable. Regardless of another truth rarely, rarely implied here. The advantages of being a Roman woman despite lacks. Mostly, the great health and longevity advantages re human antiquity states which she hardly at all addresses. Not just within the richest or more powerful women either, but for ALL the women of these Roman worlds' periods. In comparison to periods just before Rome conquered? These were eras and places of very short and brutal lives all around. All humans and on every continent. And animals had it worse. In some places and on some continents approaching or reaching the age of 40 was still rare. And all infant mortality was HUGE and continual. So I DID appreciate the detail of their lives to the intrinsic and important minutia that she included. All of the periods she covered. I've been to Pompey and the digs there myself and can vouch for the murals and the mosaics. They ARE lewd. Not all, but a number of them. She doesn't mention the huge enclosures with locks and traps that were used as safes. Still cleverly operational. Some of these houses supported 50 to 100 people within a well fed and fairly happy (defined completely differently then too, btw) lifestyle as opposed to starving half the year on a farm and dying before 30. The Roman world in all its conquests, terrible deeds, and uses for women that would never be their druthers- it also held advances in almost every field of human knowledge and skill that would not be gained again for nearly a millennia after they were lost. And women and men that DID live to 60 or 70 years. In this entire area of the world, that is true. You never get those comparison points of HUGE improvements much from a person who knows the Romans as much as this historian does. Only a much greater sense and use of ire and anger reactions for women's legal and individual perimeters. Not at all untrue- but in proportion to the author's attitude! It was definitely worth the read, this book. Despite having to pick my way through the excess slanted bilge. But I just abhor her constant crass attempts at continual humor. Some subjects are not apt for it. This is one. Looking at women of Rome's Empire through the judgment eyes of perceptions of 2000 AD plus that they would never have? Power of every sort was also operational in quite a different sense/way/method than in the post-industrial world. I'll try one more of hers but that will probably be it.

Lots of immensely shallow characters by a writer who thinks she knows psychology, Catholicism (clergy times two) and therapy practice but thoroughly does not. No more of hers for me. I finished it because I wanted to see if she would jump the shark with Ruth. Or if she would brand name drop, keep up the 4 sentence metaphors or go on to describe yet another parent wire coat hanger story at the end.No, the narrator, the President of our sorority house continues with herself as the star.

From Rangers to the specific medic on the border groups.It's told with fairness and the detail to how immigrants CAN do it legally is immense. And how that absolute hell of a physical location journey/ walking/ hiding/ starving/ dying of thirst in the deserts or scrubs could be avoided. This is a Vargas memoir and he is the core. Written with time jumps and some in and out of tangents but still with excellent solution chapters. But nothing about it was a fun read. The photos were 4 or 5 stars.People dehydrate die, drown, or are trafficked constantly. It didn't need to happen this way at all. And in the last three years the numbers are multiple, multiple of those before. Right now it is groups on Northern borders crossing illegally as well. Many are from China, Middle East, African nations, and are flying into Turkey and then getting secondary flights to Mexico. I thought he should have been more honest about Mexico's complacency.

And I don't find this or any of her characters carry God beliefs or really any type of spirituality. It's mostly all about likes and dislikes.

While for most of his life, that character was his biological and custodial parent father. Although in 1988, this was not at all an unheard or non-visible in print or in media/ entertainment either occurrence. But maybe not. Because it also holds a stark stricture style that is recognizable. Very much centered on death and recognitions of death. I've read 4 of hers and they all core on that. She has oodles of young parents or friends die in nearly all of hers. Last survivor, and orphan territory.There are always voids in hers too.

I read it in one sit down going slower toward the ending. To make it last?This will not be a 5 star for the great majority of readers. Because it cores on a deep seated feeling. A premonition that seems a certainty. The entire occurs in a mood. It's more a piece set in thinking/emotion, more than it is in group activity. And also that thinking quotient dwells at the precise core about her own self-identity for a 19 year old woman. There are some portions, even in luscious description that display essence of core Japanese sensibilities and mores. But everything in these 130 some pages is the living state of premonition. A mood within a knowledge. With a definitive ending on top of it. Masterful. These aftermaths of knowledge may hold various subjective values than a 10 Commandments type of mindset may not comprehend in a similar tone/way. Another reason many on other continents may see this finale scenario as off. This is the first I've read of hers and I will read others. 100% sure. The translation held well the tone of Japanese declarative speech and was top notch excellent for conveying the ponderance, as well.Her style is carved cutting for locales too.

But the ending just didn't equate to that for me. YET, it kept my interest throughout. This is not a fast read. Nor one with endless what is now called ""action"". It was much enjoyed because it is in the style of depth to character and carving of the locale. Also in chronological order and through one narrator's eyes. That made it a full 4 star throughout the first half.And as I rather disliked the narrator and most of the primes- this is unusual. For me, anyone with her snark and separateness quotient (BOTH) the character never gets me to embed much at all. But I did in The Busy Body. I was thoroughly abiding within the Crystal Palace's glass walls.It was the ending that restricted my rating. Too much tell and not any show whatsoever. And motive as it played? Hmmm! Not impossible but highly unlikely in such sequences of using serendipity. But I have to add too, Poirot meet up with such combos in two or three places. Yes, this is reflective of Agatha's works. Very much so.Another aspect did bother me a bit. It's more than fine to refer to other works (books, tv) etc. but it gets over the top when that is done too many times. This narrator did those comparisons as reference ambiance at 3 or 5 per 10 pages of copy. And some were extremely clever. And real in scope too. But STILL- it just doesn't fly within the ""in"" crowds now. I don't know why- but it just doesn't seem to for me. Especially within the age of this protagonist (almost 40 years age) portrayed here. Also her endless descriptions of the Bodyguard! And her availability factor in eventuality? I'm sure it occurs, but for me as displayed- that is hard to believe. THAT was written by a man- it had too many visual tells. But then again- I never understand women who become that pouncing aggressive. Nor did I know any.

Bjorn's story (and his boxing career itself) is another whole book. And the story of Pohjanen and all the other individuals within the workplace setting are at least a novella length tale. Ragahild and all the village posits/ oldsters is at least another novella. So you end up with 3 entire book lengths- I was wrong. And the 606 pages does NOT read succinct and fast (for any straight or chronological cognitive connection) in any sense either. This is the only fiction book I can remember in the last 5 years that took me an entire week to read. With only an hour or two at the most on any other perusals of print at all. HEW!Every time it went back to the 1960's and 1970's boxing career I sighed and took a break. What you get here is NOT what is focus of the trailer for this book at all. Do be aware that this is complex and not only cored on a mystery or copper case. It is far more an introspection to characters during their immense mood or life changes as those crisis times occur. For about 6 to 8 characters too- more than I named in this reaction.It's the end book of a series. Rebecka finishes at a completely different place than at the start of the series. Not only with job or relationships either. Kiruna (far North sticks Sweden) is actually the star of this whole kit and gaboodle. I enjoyed portions of this to a 6 star. Especially the skiing portions and the dogs' stories. Oh yes, that is another whole book. We have a new one too- named Villa. Tintin and the Brat are entirely themselves. My favorite character from before mid-series has always been Anne-Marie. She is done superbly here- 5 stars for all of her home placed parts especially.Absolutely my favorite Swedish writer. It was worth the wait. But STILL- I wish you would have broken this one down to 3 tomes instead of combining them all into #6. Rebecka Martinsson is NOT the prime character by the ending. IMHO, not even from the beginning of this one. The older people took over. And the mood spells of descriptive words in individuals' perceptions. Kiruna! And the snow mounds (not even in the mountain parts) are within blizzards of early May. It made Chicago seem like Miami in comparison. LOL!Loved those folks. 4.5 stars - fully. And that is outlier on any over 600 page book for me in living memory. In any decade of ing too- I do not think LONG is ever optimal.

Other than that, it is just too long winded in prose style for my taste re the period and placements. That doesn't sound fair, and probably isn't.

In other words, the style does not lend itself to much continuity beyond the plots of story line.My fiction loves are almost all far more succinct to the cores than this. In fact, I find myself not much liking any of the characters. Even Matt, the prime, seems rote flat after awhile. Overall, I like stand alone Or Kevin series McGarrity much better.

It would need the correctly chosen set of main characters as actors/ actresses though.

It taught me details about Idaho's courts and justice system too. Death penalty does exist- even to the point of firing squad for specific last choice reasonings. The case is truly horrendous. 4 killed within probably less than 20 minutes in the wee small hours of the morning- after 4 am. Winter already come to Northern Idaho in Nov. Knifed with enough bloodletting to actually drain through the floorboard and cement to the outside. The entire 3 story subdivision has recently been leveled for a memorial site.You won't get a lot of answers spelled out- only the hunt for them. And the life stories and tangents of the police officers, other sleeping residents, neighbors, families of victims- all get as much coverage as the lives of the victims do. Which is not necessarily a bad thing but for my read the balance is far off here. To motives? To why they were ""chosen""? To when it happened? Very outlier and really nearly unanswerable. Also the author makes what I judge as rather unethical statements about crime in general. Drug crimes ARE major crimes.

In fact, I really think in his multiple cultural examples and role modeling courses observed alone- he is of a kind and ultimately compassionate nature. Letting those whose brains have not matured decide what reaction ""can"" be and how to treat others and also learn, excel, move, eat etc. That is the opposite of compassion. Because self-control and entire consciousness (self-consciousness to mood and activity as well) are essentially scarred when children decide.

And the differences by continent / country and so much else that reflects in what is being learned in formal education, as well.That entire listing of core values (set into listed points- precise goals re their relative importances) in Japan vs U.

Absolutely. He is intrinsic gauge for the class systems here too for a 6 star degree. It is not just from the tailoring or dinner generosity either.He does some of his most excellent physical descriptions here- especially with the Hairless Mexican and with some of the ladies who were objects of obsession. That scenario of middle aged man obsessed to actions of insanity? It rises in several other Maugham works too. He does it well, but always over the top. With the author/narrator/ prime always as an outsider. It tells you immense volumes about Maugham. In this one his wit is superb too. There are dozens of laudable quotes in Ashenden. A few are priceless. But it in sequences becomes overlong and tends to repeat happenstance too much.Excellent and enjoyable read. I did LOL a few times.

Superb detailing of life history for both an actor and actress in the theatre of early 20th Century London, European stage. It is an exquisite look from the inside (world of theatre production and process) out. The audience of theatre goers secondary in any plot progression, flow, characters for the most part. They are carved characters when with the two primes in association.This is 5 star life onus and core (nuance incredible) for the actor prime himself. For the actress who became his wife- it is 4 star, IMHO. But extremely deep and intrepid for her core self love consistency. One of his best woman to/in relationships or as an individual that Maugham wrote, as well. But Julia is acting at all times, and that also seems, to me, Maugham's summation of female nature itself as he observed it. I enjoyed it to a 4.5 stars level. Dialogue is fabulous and this is tops in class savvy and intrinsic understanding of that firm grasp and hold upon the arts which was the fairly owned onus for this time/ society by the class of gentlemen and their ladies.I think its flaw is that there is so much heavy handed theatre play and manners of development for production in detail for the time that it gets super difficult to follow for those who are not versed in the material and subject matters of the popular productions. Shakespeare is the exception, but most readers will not know plots or scripts, nor the leading writers/stars in performance of that day. So some minor context to minutia (or humor?)may get missed.No more of the plot or of course, the obsessions- but read it. The final thought I almost always have after reading Maugham is that he puts his ""elderly women"" of travails at about 43-48 years old and ends their appeal and sexual lives at that point, almost universally. Or assumes that they believe it is surely a last hurrah. Such a window into the age again!

It's still corrupt and it's eternally backwards for supporting evil perps and making the victims of them the truly punished. But I knew GIANTS and saw much 1950's-1980's (those years especially) which make this poetry rant extremely flawed. As well as being bitter. Owned too maybe on a wide scale, but not for the life he had. Wanting more. Growth and success beyond scopes of many living now in any part of the USA-beyond their imaginings- I have seen. And it wasn't just the lucky or correct demographic either. Many related to me built the very towers. (Plaster in 100 floors to Palmer House artistry).Being born at 5602 S. Racine in 1948- neither my love or disdain is anywhere near Algren's. Not even after 75 plus years. And I am the one behind the corner store (different kind all the time) in most every generation since. The ones he said had not a chance within fine and abusive poetry.It IS a vast plain of grey with humongous suburbs of green around it. And always spreading. But the city itself is on decline and this is accelerating now after at least 30 years of solid downhill. Still as fiddled and still as intrepid yet. Both.Because I disliked the corny (self considered swank) style of this author and era so much- I often failed to see the relevance overall for the gushing aspects. He misses some extremes in the events he cores of the earliest 20th century at that. And nearly everything but the constant strong oppositional attitudes. Well, I would make this far too long if I got into details. But Algren was truthful in the fact and reality that it holds crux very unlike most other American cities. And the neighborhoods' cultures also hold wider dimensions of both greater acting love and deserved animosities. Holding maybe 15 to 20 great jobs from 1965 to 1975 alone? Algren had SO little window into opportunity for the 20 to 30 years AFTER this was written. He was bitter. Probably justifiably. But ranting in prose poetry often made that fact even less pretty than that condition becomes.This made me think. Especially the Afterword. I have 5 dearest (maybe 6 depending upon how you judge locale by ""from away"" or by home people) being spit in and out every single day. Not only weekdays. Every grown grandchild but one, in fact.

Many kids of that era (I am one)- were years and years above their physical ages. Mainly due to both roaming and responsibility in huge proportions. Most of which since about 1990 or so- is generally now ruled as factors of child abuse. Working cotton or cloth bolts, in stores of nearly every nature, small machines like blenders churns/ pumps, stocking shelves, unloading trucks, garden (hours and hours just like Luke) all part of the normal kids' lives. It was for me. I also worked Pearl's counter before I was 8.This setting and the economics of that system in Arkansas cotton farming in 1950's! It really comes home even now- why migration North happened in droves. Not at all only from Arkansas.Loved the prose flow and it was a pleasure to read this book. And I can't say that is true for at least 10 books out of the last 20 I've read. No switching, no era jumps, no context discontinuity here. YES! I'm a fan.But what I loved the very most was the family, religion, community feel. Do I miss it. Totally gone in almost all places but the smallest towns now, and at times not even there. Too much about ""identity"" division is just the tip of the iceberg to all that. No manners in even asking- now you are literally invaded or robbed. It was a really good tale to read in late Fall, early Winter too- in the rain. Picking cotton is awful. So is picking blueberries. I've done both.

Other than W. SoNearing the very end of 2023, I fine this read to be one of the top 5 most authentic voices for the books I've read during this year. Other than W. Somerset Maugham-I can't think of any author who represents the individual ""eyes"" of where, when it ""was"" as well as this Grazia Deledda does. Her characters here- especially Efix! They are what they believe and what they represent. Almost purely themselves. Others call it a ""carried guilt""- but it is more than just knowing one's own essence beyond guilt or joys or history. It is completely of its own time and place. Sardinia during the earliest years of the 1900's. It happens to be completely contemporary to the lives my Grandparents lived in Sicily as children or as teens at the turn of the 20th century. It's onus -the core of this entire place and the tale's message is obscure but it is THIS. It is a long term conspiracy (by only 1 individual? or by 50)for keeping the young (young is often relative too) and the families who exist where they are ""now"". And not join the lost- which are those who have left. Or if by some impossible circumstance, to contain and keep the ones who were ""left"" and have returned to their proper farm and village. And proper role for the order of this culture beyond just the ""staying"". Nobles and their houses lost! Or just for now sleeping!The tale is difficult to read. It almost reads like magical realism. But it could not be more real or more representative of the times of mass emigration. Because the spiritual, the myths, the nature, and the sprites are constantly present in the strictures of Italian country culture. And acting daily for their roles and retributions. The dialogue is difficult for 21st century minds to grasp. You almost need to interpret the gist and the discussed reality of the speakers as if you were translating a language base. Be aware, this does not have great length- but the depth is so immense that it will take much time to read. I would probably have given this excellent work a 5, if I knew less about the whys and wherefores and reality of why the young planned their escapes and then just did it. And almost all were never seen by their families again. My Sicilian grandparents never saw any of their birth families (individuals/ siblings/ parents) who didn't leave or ANY in the older generations left behind. Not once. Nor their country again. Nor their birth continent again. And just like here, there were terrible sicknesses, poverty to leave behind as well.This is a book that I absolutely believe very few readers of our current period would like for several reasons. You need to ""get"" the undercurrent of the restrictions for female and also even more-the entire established senses of places and honor. It is almost entirely dominated by the cultural mores which put the average human's belief system of what IS corporal or REAL in an entirely separate sphere from what the 21st century mindset now sets as ""the real"" or ""true"". Or even perhaps of the entire last century before that for some readers' ""knowing"". Because here the spiritual, the mental, the moral AND the physical ""rules"" are far, far more absolutes. Never subjective, always fixed.

And then I read the next one.This one is perfection despite the beginning feeling and continuation for some time as tell rather than show. But I LOVE the way Maugham looks back and yet HE is ever the person he was then as much as he is in his NOW. Both being quite unlike but also just as immensely savvy.There is a priceless section of about 10 pages in the middle of the 100's (by count pages in my paperback edition) that does the best critique of fiction writers for his age or any other. And this is coming from a person who 90% of the time LOATHES writers trilling on about writing itself. This is entirely outlier to that usual discourse this takes for the 100 years since, as well. I did laugh out loud. Bad writing is just now in English- more than identical in comparisons for the level of BAD. Worse for the word and prose flow habits he describes exquisitely.It was called satire in the trailer here. No. Nothing like satire as it is defined in the 21st century presently. Now satire contains 75% snot and snark. Also anger at points. This doesn't hold 1% of that element. Maugham at 16 to 21 (as he is here in much of this tale- and telling it 25 years plus later) is a snob of his class that wouldn't KNOW unkind or raw comment to other males, let alone a female. His manners are THAT embedded.Rosie is one of those characters you will NEVER forget if you read this. For some reason I was brought to mind of Alfred Hitchcock or writers like Dickens who have wild and loose women with hearts of gold. Women who are unable to pass a negative word about others, least of all their comrades. In the American South they would be comparable to the ""Bless your heart"" women. You also get here the man-who this author truly was. He knows schmooze to the max and has perfected it over a lifetime. ALL THE CONNECTIONS he needs, plus all the associations he wants. And he doesn't need to do it much by praise either. Or flawed fawning. But by ultimate best placements and availabilities whenever his own druthers of vast travel or possible intrepid adventures do not raise their heads. And does he know where to cut and balk at the same time.One of the best reflections of these earliest years of the 20th century that I have ever read for this particular class and placement. Absolutely. Cakes and Ale can hardly be appreciated within the times we hold though. I don't think present young or general populations of English readers at all appreciate this language depth or form of conversational patterns. Or even understand the nuance of a good portion of it. English has lost its vast vocabulary by 1000's of words as well since Maugham's youth and prime of life era.

Fully half of the book is in italics as it is a written diary or papers being read by the author or by others at a latter time than when they were written. It nearly made me drop it to a 3, as I cannot stand that print form at length and actually cannot read it well anymore. Slows me down considerably. But to be fair- it was a good premise and he did this entire scenario quite well. And most are underrating it, IMHO. Yes, it's simplified. But actually it is NOT unrealistic or as over the top as 4 out of 5 horrendous dysfunction family and mystery stuff is presently (2023). Many times I questioned Ashley's responses or reactions to being left by Emma in her own house or town as much as she clearly was doing. So I knew from nearly the get-go that so much was off.

It is the most real context (politico or otherwise too) in every sense that I've read in years and years. Memoir is just the top of the iceberg what he defines and also FEELS here.If not open enough for a total read (I would say at least half of the Goodreads crowd is not open minded enough to do so), the Introduction itself (7 stars, I'm not kidding) is super worth the effort. And this is coming from a person who states the truth because I often mention skipping the Intros until after reading the proper whole. In nearly every genre of non-fiction, absolutely true. So I totally recommend this Introduction, if nothing else is read.In truth and in outcomes, I have viewed the exact same as Gianno. Also in primarily the same exact places. His in much later decades- but mine is not all that different. If anything it was BETTER in 1950 or 1960 than it is now for numerous logistics he has experienced. And many more wonderful and much happier people worked then, as well. Had jobs, had family, had much more joy in these exact places.If you are a Southside Chicagoan, this is the only spot on book in fiction or in non-fiction that I've ever come across from the horse's mouth. Gianna had his bike stolen within 10 blocks from where mine was at 7. And I never got another one either. And one of his first incidents mentioned is 10 or 12 blocks south of one of my most intense memories during the year I was 17-18. Mine was harder, as it ended in a hospital. Total stranger assault. One of three I can recall.The chapter ""Bruh, You're From Evanston"" is priceless. It's the same phrase I used once, right here. Did I laugh when I read that title!Do I agree with him always. Not at all. But I applaud his immense values and eyes to speak the truth. As the great body of Southside Black Americans do NOT enjoy or believe in anyway for the policies of the ""empathizers"". In fact, quite the opposite. Family, structure, church, cultural habits are IMPORTANT in legacy to them.If you have any interest in real life urban. This is the one to read.

For her time period and placements she was a more than remarkable woman. And this novel made her husband sound exceptional as well.The first 1/3rd was 4 to 4.5 stars, easily. Finding our protagonist at 54 with full skills and district associations. With the lives of her children just as interesting.But despite all these extremely high ratings on Goodreads, the pace? Not only the cohesiveness of its progression either. Lengthy tangents of law, past events galore (time span switching also) and murder, rape, mayhem entering and exiting the picture. At times the sidebars connected very gingerly, if at all. This was meat for at least 2 full books, possibly 3. And told in such flashbacks and memory? With 50% emotional or high drama effusions off and on again like a roller coaster ride? Not a fan. This is better than average for total content- but also entirely in Chick Lit. designation mood and effusion. Life then was harsh and early death often. At times in this book I left it for great pauses because it actually became overblown tedious in reliving past tragedies or present lawful lengthy extensions. I'm not sure I would take another of this author because this is not a style of telling that I enjoy very much. Yes, I guess so true, Martha is the authority of skills mostly unsung or unheard for their importance? But regardless, just too much in the tell portions. All the show portions of the book were much better. This is a period when many women would spend great portions of their adult lives pregnant or nursing.Very worthy subject matter but just beyond any of my real history believability factor that I own. And way too long in this version of telling. With a good editor it would have been 4 star level easily.I can understand how so many women gave this 5 stars. But the pace and holding together as a literary entity both- closer to 2. Hallmark movie tone of the writing too- made this hard to balance as more than a 3 star read.

Set into the world of the second half of Queen Victoria's reign, but far from only in England. This is the tale of the last Tsars of Russia and also of the many German principalities and nobles within Europe of those times. Especially to the grandchildren of Queen Victoria herself. So the more you know about the Victorian era reigning families on the whole- the more you will probably like this informative tale. Most especially about, but not excluding numerous cousins, the children of Queen Victoria's daughter, Alice. Alice who died young. Her daughters Ella and Alix (Elisabeth and Alexandra) are featured in particular.I was enthralled during the first half. Became much more patient and could leave this and yet always return- during the 2nd half. Because it does NOT become a simple tell tale whatsoever. Always more tangled and complex as religious strictures, family loyalties, distances of contact and also intense (in many cases) personal relationships beyond just the duty measured by blood decree or birth culture as they strongly occur. Most stridently of all for those of Alice's children who looked East to marry into Russia as a Romanov Bride. Something their Grandmother, the English Queen does not at all desire nor does she approve.It is entirely of its own time in the telling. Personalities differ in the many characters, of course, but the cultural mores, tenets, boundaries, moral value senses- are all deeply seated in the 19th century. So much so, that the realities to reign/rule of the 20th century scurry too far away for even imaging. No more so than for those who will be most highly effected.You will need to peruse the relationship graphs at the beginning. And some readers will use them during the read itself. Large families for the great majority of ruling class itself and Victoria's offspring in particular. And you might also see the path of the inherited genetic blood disease as well. It's main negative as a novel is that the last marriage is SO difficult in happening and takes years of contriving to achieve. In real time it did. It cannot be manufactured otherwise for print. But reading years of this courting dance are SLOW going- reflected in others' eyes. Hard to make it otherwise. But not as easy to read. That gets to be tell, tell, tell, and gossip cabals on overrun.Because I know the history, I knew what was coming- but for those who don't this may be another type of experience in the slower portions.

Core tastes of those places, and not only for social world or food or contacts crossed either. But rounded up for the psychology of insights to a certain madness.Well, having just read House of Doors (Eng) this was the perfect piece to tie that mood and individual cored pick, choose, and use others' lifestyles that Willie (Maugham) so owned.Strickland is so nasty, evil in cognition and in most actions that I find it nearly unbelievable that I am giving this the full 5. It's because the way he was set here. He's framed as a gem in a priceless central piece of jewelry. The narrator, the women, the other primes- they all become quite secondary. Despite being carved down to the snicker or quirk as each of them were.Willie sure could write. And not in a style that is quite approached in even the most erudite and twisty talented to double negative reverse clauses or void skills of current 2000 plus fiction. Now I must reread or read his others. Because he writes circles around and lastly through a mood, or place. And always with the superb dialogue of a ""show"" portion. Never being all ""tell"".This story will stay with me. Filled with extremes and especially for the quotes. Those I could list but won't. It reminded me too of a debate I had with someone way back in the 1960's (or it could have been even earlier in childhood) the first time I read that ""women have no souls"". As an individual, I have always had a difficult, difficult time accepting any of the arts (music, manual arts of any kind for which they have museums etc.) in such a light as it is demonstrated in this book. Especially as it houses or relays emotion. So take this 5 as one I was not prepared to give whatsoever. Because this book even persuaded me of their importance. Well at least to a few individuals. Regardless of making those ""arts"" no less evil or destructive or manipulative on the whole. Beauty truly is in the eye of the beholder. Almost as much as ""helping"" is enabling as much as it is charity. Never so much more true than in long term outcomes....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Oct 30, 2023","Nov 04, 2023","Oct 24, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/44796.The_Moon_and_Sixpence

And the English prose, the flow to melodious English clause sequencing, is even better. This author can write rings around most others of his century, and so far I have not found one from this current century that comes close. And that doesn't suggest that the pace of the novel is similar in part to part (chapters) at all. Here he even suggests you might want to skip the one near the ending which topic covers humans and their God sense to ""what's it all about, Alfie"" psychology/philosophy/structural religious belief spectrum.6 or 7 exquisitely defined characters which are often most revealed in their dialogues. Often with each other or with the narrator who is the author. Although in this particular Maugham novel I feel that the author was also intrinsic and autobiographical in stances to /with his character Eliot. This is a read that is deep. Covers continents and places extremely varied, and is cored on the character of Larry. And read it when you have time to think and not while multi-tasking. Most of us never schedule such a time. Do, if you can.Once again, I do think Maugham does the men to perfection while never quite getting to that pinnacle with the women. 90% of the time they radiate only from men's aspects to and with them. Within millennia of human word recording, language- it possibly may be true that much of the time too that onus was closer to true? I do not know but it may have been.It's not a perfect book. At times he jumps and it gets a trifle choppy. But he tells you when it is out of sequence of time- also to the precise message that he has tried to relay so the READER can incur the reality in chronological order of their occurrence and fall outs. This was taken within 2 days in two long sit down reads. I would never do it truly piecemeal.Reading a book and author in this splendid melodrama heights and luscious mode of words like this one- and in a direct to reader style? It makes me smile but then I am reminded that I have little hope of outliving the atrocious endemic styles of hopping, switching, duo or triple regurgitating forms of the current fiction. Even some of the better carved to character.Well worth doing a trio of movies, let alone two. But not with Bill Murray as Larry. That has got to be one of the most miscast roles of all time. Almost as bad as Tom Cruise being Reacher.Strongly recommend this read if you have never read it. I am rereading most of Maugham that I had read before too. He's best with the knowledge of age added. This one was written in age too- you sure can tell. Brilliant!Also I find I have to add this- you will get synopsis up the kudzu on this one. If you are the kind of person who loves knowledge seeking (returns to school or classes on skills to attain too) many times over a lifetime or seeks change and variety in work endlessly- you will ADORE this novel. There aren't a lot of us- but reading about them is easier than living most of it.

If you expect it to be all about news or politics- know that it is not.Tucker's early life was, IMHO, way outlier in situation. Both within family, economics, experiences allowed and also pure risk. Because he was raised only by his father who was intrepid and just let him loose. It forms self-identity and independence way, way before any norm of ""now-a-days"" does. And was even more ""different"" then.His father's story is also enthralling. Dick Carlson was sure a pistol. Moore did this superbly to Tucker's core self-identity judgments of importance and various directions he has taken. His personality is not that of an elite, nor even of any norm for 2023. His value system is much simpler.The pure evil of violence in groups that have physically and verbally attacked all of them (friends and relatives too) at his home! With wife and his 4 children (daughter in college story made my blood boil)- if anything is understated here. I very much disagree with posters who say this was rushed and doesn't cover intrinsic biography. Quite the opposite. Because he is not a joiner. Not a conformist to party. It shows, and doesn't have to just tell.Kudos to Moore. Very difficult job. Tucker Carson is not a person I thought was omnipotent or was a subject of nearly adoration as some of the ers here display at all. But I understand Tucker. He is not a bs pretty language lover. He was always bored and broke rules because of it. He is truthful for observing outcomes nearly completely. And he doesn't groupthink. I don't either. I really have an inkling that people who live groupthink core concepts as ""true"" will always have a hard time and hatred for a word smith like Tucker.It was fun to learn he reads constantly as I always have.

This also had the best politico context and maps for several situations (both during/ after 1871 and also latter fires)- that I have seen. And I have seen what is in Regenstein (U. of Chicago).But it was not easy to read- it is text book accuracy and pace. But also with so many name drops and situational momentary or month long at a time stances- hard to digest. 100's of characters and yet you did get the blame games and other nuances of both short and long term. Some in court case judgments. Mrs. O'Leary was the typical scrape goat. What is best about this telling is the approaching and true relevance (example times 100's) of the energy and general mania of that time period in Chicago. And also much later- well into the 1960's at least. Not entirely gone now but so much reduced in the 21st century- that it is not the same core quantity or strength of/for conceptual direction. Dirty politics, corruption or directionless rhetoric of ever evolving blame games- it did go from to eternal ""we can do"" (populace and leaderships of all types) to vast areas of ""we can take or grab"" endlessly as a common core mantra. I call it the ""be the least you can be"" individual commodity held in vast Chicago areas now. Both visually and with intersecting conversations all around now for most any Chicago location practical outing or intersect.Loved the photos and graphics quite beyond some of the generalizations which do not always surround them in the copy. And are just that, generalizations for what was then extremely small locales.The energy and pure power of optimism and cutting through bs and bureaucracy to fulfill all the physical doing and the people who work process of such in Chicago still does exist. But not even in a one to ten ratio to what it was. The book does rather imply a similar path overall to that direction, but also has vast areas of void, IMHO. Like how the immense areas of decline occurred within great geographic realities during migrations in this and latter periods (which he covers somewhat for other factions) is not adequately (or even correctly) detailed by Berg. Also I think the book did way too much on the politico cabals and people who left Chicago and should have done a bit more about fallout from the fire to latter excellence in 100 different forms. How it acted upon innovation instead of doing the opposite after disaster as it has elsewhere.

Not made any less by the author speaking directly to the reader as asides to the plot copy. They are doing that in film/ digital visuals again too. Annika on PBS/ BBC does it. And I've liked that since Shakespeare. Especially when it is done as well and witty as it was here. No synopsis. Come in yourself and read about the family reunion at the Sky Lodge. This would be perfect for winter blizzard reading. You need to take some jumps over believability fences. I had trouble with the ash suffocation type of method done successfully that many times. But pay attention to the Ronald Knox 10 rules for the mystery whodunit genre. It was as true back in 1929 as it is now. That's why I so often know who the perp is by page 100. They mostly still follow those rules. And the cheater authors who don't follow those 10 rules are almost all 1 book success fly by nights too. I've noticed. Follow/ fool me once etc.; follow/ fool me twice etc.It was not perfect and at points became difficult to connote. But he did follow almost every one of the 10 rules, or noted one, at least, that he didn't fulfill one in exactness of ""true"".He is a stand up comic too. You sure can tell.

Not that the humor isn't still there- but it is more a sit. com. type of humor with mostly one liners. Because the case directions themselves are buried in various and at times nearly oppositional interpretations of laws. Roman laws.So you have a treatise on minutia of manumission status interpretations rather than a case of criminal deed as the central focus. And this is so true. An informer is not always going about because of a body or missing goods or some other dire assault factor solutions for retributions etc.For me this just dragged. And I am one who on the whole likes to ponder or list or number note the various declensions of formal governmental laws. But in this case? Too many characters to keep track of and I felt the eruditeness of the whole didn't not meld well with the usual Tiberius and Flavia humor. I did like that she got Flavia's sisters in the act for awhile.So for me the pace flow just seemed stymied with dozens of asides. I would rather have heard more about what was going to be done with the usable bricks taken from Fountain Court. Davis's knowledge of the Roman Law and the various curlicues of sidestepping it are more than impressive. Like another current situation I can think of- the downfall and failure of any good system is met with ever increasing corruption, mostly embedded within cronyism. It WAS a hard job that Flavia took on this time. Just not one that is linear in any way to read about. So despite the credible ending, most of this read just dragged.

Nor the constantly moving individual lifestyle the key.But overall, considering the writing by the duo and several other factors of doing this after 27 or so other Reacher, it isn't as bad as it might have been.STILL- it barely got to 3. The writing is brisk and fast moving. Nothing at all to truly contemplate, IMHO- because repetition of the ""knowns"" in the team set up to stop the killings is nearly constant. And because I remember those years well, it could have gotten much more time savvy specific.It has the Reacher base thought/ responses that ARE Reacher. (The last one or two in the series of aging Reacher I thought were not on that track at all- Reacher did not own the same set of moral codes nor did he estimate/contemplate adversary in a Reacher sense). So therefore, I did think this one was better overall then those last few. BUT- still never beyond a 2.5 stars in plot, nor in overall executions. Not for lack of the Reacher fisticuffs etc. per se, but for the murderers' deeds and continual successes. Yes, these were not at all believable. These (murdered) were people who had dense past lives and all 6 or 7 of them would never have been as stupid to fall for the set ups as posited. Most especially for the one who tried to rescue himself just because he saw this woman laying on a ledge. Never happen. Also the Denver one on the lake. NOPE!Well, it was entertaining to about a 3 also. But not at all on the intellectual nor nuance of emotion that many of the former Reacher owned in spades. I did not mind the plot diversions. The super high body count and several of the serendipity messes Reacher did encounter did NOT raise the entire platform for me at all though.

And religion displayed without much core inklings for God love or concepts of motivational beliefs or sincere caring affections of kindness? This didn't work as a whole tale for me.

The only reason I can't round it up is because the evil is so classic. I know that truly doesn't make sense- but it is central to what I feel. When the deed is SO morally and distinctly opposed to any sense of loyalty or love- I find that a classic theme nugget. (Especially between a parent/ child as in the Greek classics.) Yet that does diminish the premise or concept or whatever rests as the karma of a novel. It does for me.But this Caretaker is written as well as any 5 star fiction I've read in about 5 years. Just masterfully. With the character Blackburn as the intense observing eyes, that was superb. Add to that the intense locale feel which was also incredible.The parents of Jacob! How despicable and also unforgiveable. How could such supposedly ""normal"" parents equivocate to such depths of evil nasty.Rash sees human as eternally embedded in this element of worst. It's why I've liked his short stories BETTER- as the primes don't ever get to do as pure bad as they do in his novel lengths.

Various prose form descriptions themselves most probably make this at least a 3 star. Trying to be fair.Well, it is meant to be outlier in nearly every sense of time or space continuity. And the individuals are not always themselves from one title to the next, IMHO. Titles being the named divisions of the book. Short divisions (I don't know that you would call them stories either) segments of different nuance, locale, era, dimensions to the others. At times you have no idea that they are or will be in anyway related.I certainly did not grab all the depth that many other ers seem to imply that they did. Instead I found this far more a science fiction authorized sets of ""eyes"" which in great part posited symbolism of various emotional or especially neediness based self-identities. One aspect being how some can expand their reality (empirical core ""knowing"") beyond themselves alone. Or how merciless human connectedness endings (not only mortality/death either) can be.Actually with very little deep thought of my own by the last story/division (as I was too annoyed by jumpiness of illogical juxtapositions) I became convinced this that was a type of reincarnation composite mixed with science fiction dimensional appropriations. Yet not only in physical placements or what comes around goes around categories of karma either.Regardless, for me, it was a chore to read. Not only confusing but at points over the top in English comparison forms. I was super glad when I was done. Most of the characters were eternally sad when you got down to it. Couldn't make their own fun whatsoever and needed some other element. Like a terrace. To be functional.Probably belongs in one of my most disliked categories which is growing like mad in these modern fictional times- ""Life is shit, and then we die"".Some philosophy prone erudite theory living (as opposed to practical applications working folks) will love this stuff.

Actually this could have been two books. I detest when the first few pages have almost no connection at all to any person or event of the next 300 pages. That happens here. I will try to be succinct and it is difficult. I could go too long too on this one. Methos knows more than the average writer of this current genre. Yet, does he need to tell and tell all of it repeatedly. Especially with personality or dysfunction features or classifications- we get it. The readers get it already. And within his dialogue especially (not a fan) this overkill (a pun intended) is at a 2 star level. Within mostly otherwise decent prose flow- it jars. There are writers who write brilliant character speak dialogue (Horowitz is one, Julian Fellowes is another) and then there are those who don't. Methos has this considerable weak point. His people talk like melodrama of the 1920's or people in analysis under hypnosis. Or just not par with their character context or placements.Juxtaposition of players oddity was beyond believability for me too. But that I could swallow more than Tara talking like special needs 12 years old one minute and then a 50 year old tenured PhD the next. Jessica is a font of seething reactions and then? Yes, depth in developments but at the same time proportionally skewed almost to a cartoonish level. Over the top and I was not able to swallow such phenomenal changes depicted in this book. Nor the Yardley acceptances of Wesley either that occurred in the first 150 pages. Nor the mixture of Jessica being so savvy in the workplace and almost nothing but a emotionally collapsed wreck in the personal self-identity out of work life. This is found in many female leads of this genre currently. And it is in real life nearly absurd. I wonder if the authors have ever talked to these women in their real life balances.Then why did I give it 4 stars? Because with all the repetition, I still wanted to read on. Often I don't. It was not as good as his stand alone and it was also way too brutal, chewy, gory and yet still I wanted to continue. Although putting it down 4 or 5 times between other books.I will read #2 but then I will be done with this level of gore, despite the law side savvy. He does courts better than most any current fiction author. If I read that he has court stand alone fare- that would work though.This is the absolute truth. Do I read too much! I looked at the page number and wrote it down. Because on page 116 out of nearly 500 (large print copy)- I knew who the murderer of the couples copycat killer was for sure.

And not just under Vatican Hill either.This read brings you into the first 3 centuries of Christianity scratched beliefs too- even to the intercession of Mary. What their ""code speak"" was and it was absolutely intriguing! Priests of the 20th century ALWAYS would preclude women in head authority roles regardless of titles or hierarchies of practical applications. It flummoxes me how so many moderns of this century do not understand most any of the base issues in authority that went on during the times 1939-2000. If you are at all interested in Italian cultural mores too- read this. History as it played out in real time. Chronologically with immense research and sources.The photographs were outstanding.

Yet I think the ghost narration, which at points was beautifully done- also detracted a bit for the present and alive narrators, Jean and Laura. Hard to say how it did, but for me, it blunted the intensity of both alive women's travails and decisions. And they were core to the book.This was a deep dive into the reality of fighting cancer as it often plays out. Three women close friends and my sister (this year for the 3rd time in her life) could tell nearly identical tales. It's worth reading for Laura's voice alone despite that not being the definitive core event. (She is a genealogy search librarian.) Because the murder of one young woman and two little girls WAS. To be KNOWN and to be remembered properly the goal of their legacies. Please!Because I read non-fiction true crime, I knew exactly which serial killer and all the outcomes before I was on page 30. And also of the identity searches in real time / life scenarios as they occurred. But nevertheless, it did not at all take away from the reading experience. That was nearly 5 stars as it was so encompassing to wider themes and life/death struggles as humans experience. Often they do.This was a once a month serendipity read knowing nothing at all of subject matter or genre. I picked it from the NEW shelf for its exquisite cover. And exactly at this time I was also putting up a set of moonflower vines to replant in new spaces. Often I get a 2 star out of that practice and yet this time was nearly a 5. I would absolutely read more of hers. Jean, the police officer was also done well- retirement at young ages being a very often and current reality in this less than optimal for lawful times.For those of you who don't know. That serial killer did it multiple times after various different years of living with them as families. And he died in prison in 2010. But Herchenroether did an excellent fictional work of how it all could have happened. And actually did for 90% of the nuance and placements. He left bodies in drums in New England area as well as other locations. This one was in New Mexico's Gila Forest. This is not a spoiler, as you know of the crimes from the first pages here.I recommend this for the true thoughts of cancer fight experience so excellently done and also the beauty of the prose in more than a couple of spots. Regardless of there being an underpinning of no faith or angel belief. Which truly kept obscured the ghost narrations for me. They are caught in such low circular voids without faith here.This one deserves a quote (if you have been close to death you know exactly what this nails):""She knew there were two types of people: people who knew they got to be alive and people who expected it.”― Sara Herchenroether, The Night Flowers...more",Notes are private!,1,5,1,"Aug 17, 2023","Aug 20, 2023","Aug 17, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/62972518-the-night-flowers

As he details and does the testimony as it is. Not through 2 others interpreted. Which does not suggest that he doesn't have an opinion either.

Because it is for those long investigative room or trial sections nearly transcript quoted.This is also a core example of how ""we think"" and ""what we know"" colors and controls entire populations without being hardly evident from the outside eyes. And also how police work is done extremely poorly for a dozen different reasons. So much more core than just putting up the tape and pressuring witness statements inquiry sessions. And never forget that this is also 1991 when forensics was so much less the starring role. Fantastic personality studies on at least 8 or 9 primes.

The surrounds of fox spirits coupled with all types of characters that are fully human. This enthralled me to embedding nearly immediately and for length kept me eagerly coming back. "" I hate it wen people make decisions for me. Especially when it's done in a noble and valiant way, the way Kuro goes through life. You know those heroes of old, the ones willing to throw themselves over a battlement to save a besieged citadel? Well, I don't know any of them either- at least not living ones. They all end up dead and who's left to bury their mutilated bodies and write mournful poems to their starving families? The rest of us, that's who.""Strongly recommend this read- it will take you to another time and place. She's outdid herself with #3.

Normal being: seated solidly within conscience, unforgotten responsibility regardless of context circumstances and not operating by entirely subjective moralities.Knowing too much about the process of practices as the LA doctor/ personage had featured within this novel- I can say the pleasure I felt in this read was 2 star. Also intense at points, but I could put it down. Twice. Yet the language and especially the nuance of the core personalities for the ""good"" guys (those 2 on the professional side) was 5 stars drawn. To me both of them, the attorney and the psychiatrist, were repulsive at core. Outlier opinion, I am sure. But behaviors were atrocious for their givens in education AND professional dictates. Both of them.So I say, it is dark. And also super convoluted. But probably as real as dirt. Good writer that gave some absolutely soulless and selfish dysfunctional (and yet seemingly thriving) full page ads for nasty groups of paired individuals on both opposing pages of this novel/ newspaper/ plot edition. Some disbelief barriers do need to be jumped over though. Although tawdry times are in such abound presently- it might not be impossible to happen.Do not read this novel if you have any aversion to therapy ""talk"" language and participle parsed and squared. Because parts of this run like long DSM 5 grad school lectures. And be warned that some of the worst possible human behaviors become features.

It is told through the eyes of three different characters. And throughout could easily be a Hallmark movie. The crux is that of a long married woman taking an over compensating affection and love for a neighbor child. Its time period is between 1940- 1972 in a small Northern Ontario town. And that seemed real and the juxtapositions actual too. But other than that- the primes are drawn in such characteristics that as much as they are carved defined- they are also quirky and frankly for me, more single dimensional than any humans I have known. Obsessed weird one track.I found myself wanting to speed read, but I didn't. When it was Liam's sections, I had far more of an interest. At least he didn't seem as shallow or fixated. I can't at all confront in my own reasoning, how any parent could let an under 8 year old stand endlessly in all waking hours by a window.

And the second half was much less intense or embedding urgency than the first half. Yet, even saying that about ""Berlin"" and this debut novel itself- isn't telling you how GOOD the writing is. The writer knows the self-involvement of terribly altered perceptions. Something that in 2023 could be a truly top ten category subject for the population as a whole. As nihilistic philosophy or some various type of victim mentality perception is seated (and as a GOOD thing on top of it) in more than half the population . This could go long as I have tracking and psychology practice in a decade or more of my past. This Daphne was a true parallel to several (more than a few) seeking grad or PhD school level (students) courses, IMHO. Self-centric of intense degree, not as cored as Daphne with negativity, but close. Bea Setton knows how to tell constant mundane daily reaction from the most inside/ out eyes. Pathological lying being only the tip of the iceberg. It's not pleasant to read of such mental illness without giving it a name or category, IMHO. I went into this book as a serendipity read just from the cover and in paperback form (library new shelf pick). So had not an iota of category age group or subject matter I was getting. Only knowing it was IN Berlin. The only European city l have experienced being quite like my own. (Chicago) Not only in appearances, either. But it is NOT a fun read. Just pathetic, actually. Living for a reaction or to maintain some facade. Because the self worth for goals of economics or job/ work love or any deep ideal of spirit in any way is not at all present. Sick. I knew she was anorexic from the beginning- BUT. Well, it is not a book that most will want to read- but I am glad I did. Some quotes almost made me give this book 5 stars. She is an excellent writer. Mostly, IMHO, Setton hit a key reason why some humans use others so much and do not at all consider most of the baggage they have left with others behind in hurt or worse damage. Because their perceptions and selfishness (from sickness or insanity or just plain insular habits of being pleased continually- are that far off).Quotes (only a few out of 100 that would make a great philosophy course):""He thought, as many intellectual men do, that ceaselessly pointing everything out that is bad in the world was enough to make him good.""""This probably says something about me- I've never been very good at 'going with it.'

Nothing wrong with her cognitive memory, that's for sure.Interesting on about 3 to 5 aspects for me. Chicago for much of her life, yet born and raised in a much earlier and nearly rural described San Francisco. No bridge. LOL! But I have a granddaughter who went to Loyola during the Final Four basketball events that made Sister Jean so media known and popular. This was written when she was 103. My granddaughter worked and had lots of photos with her about 3 to 4 years ago when she was a Nursing student undergrad at Loyola. She is now a traveling Nurse and as Sister Jean states multiple times (an email frenzy person)- she sure does keep in touch.Regardless, it is well worth the read. Just to contemplate her directness, faith incredible, and undiminished mix of wanting and being embedded with people. Usually the young, but not always at any level of her roles. I remember Mundelein well- and had friends (lucky them) get to go there back in the day. It eventually got embedded and taken over by Loyola University. Sister Jean lives there now, in downtown Chicago. A few people she mentions from her past associates I do know. She is an accurate accessor to character. That's a 5 star.Do I agree with all her asides. Nope! But I do with her methods. And her optimism. And her good intent that is almost entirely universal. Her order has the motherhouse in Dubuque Iowa but she has been in Chicago for a majority of her life- yet at very different times. All in safer places that I was. LOL! And I do laugh at her Northside descriptions for the same eras. So much easier to assume and define perimeters for attitudes or ""best"" when you are physically in cozy places. It is.She has been a BVM sister (really not a nun because nuns are contemplative) and an active dynamo since she was 18 years old. She went to Iowa as a postulant days after her 18th birthday. Much schooling over different periods of her life too -but still active in her office location. She STILL is. But I don't think she is the basketball chaplain as she was.

I do not agree with other posters' definitions of individualism in their interpretations of what they read here re hers. If they did read it all. But I do not agree with the author's either. It's giving the abstraction way too much inertia/ purpose etc. Most especially for her/their interpretations of Twenge's mentions for individualism's roles. At points Twenge's posits for individualism? Either as traits or as action habits? It is NOT giving identity labels. It is NOT a part of cancel culture rote mode or group think collective ""must"" feel either.The historic record definition of individualism cores on self-sufficiency. It was often paired with the word ""rugged"" for intrinsic reasons. It is NOT self-labeling as a member of a group, nor in a self-identity sense of category for human or some type of being gypped victimhood identity. Quite the opposite. It stands alone and may not recognize group think authority or classifications at all. Or if partially, only because it originates within the individuals' rights and responsibilities for THEMSELVES. BOTH! This is not a receiving end or identity labeling function but a positive originating onus. Totally the opposite.I actually think it is humorous that so many quite young believe they can redefine English words or abstractions/ concepts to mean the opposite of their original core meanings. Being anti-authority doesn't mean the same as individualism AT ALL either. In fact, the strongest individualism cares little for authority and wants at best, the smallest amount possible. Government or otherwise. Because it stands in a place where the single person is sufficient to deal with the values and actions of themselves and their surroundings.This book was a fair and exhaustive survey and was NOT middle right wing as judged by . AT ALL. If that were the case for definitions alone- than JFK must have been a far right wing Fascist (as labels have progressed to that!). He wasn't. What I do ponder after some contemplation is that it seems I may have learned almost as much from reading s for this as I did from the book. Because the realities of process, self-perception, and outcomes (economic especially) are not what some people want to hear for their tech relying or any economic or strength against adversity aspect advantage position-so they seem to vilify the messenger in/for reactions. Or they do not want to begin to compare to the world before vast tech and work life (in and out of the home) changes. They don't care to. Ever. I lived without air conditioning for weeks over 90 degrees more than a few times when they picked up bodies in the morning. Child and adult both, I did. Also remember friends in iron lungs and paralyzed and being witness to death 3 times before I was 10. (Rare as hen's teeth for decades now and none of them were anywhere near a hospital room.) And physical safety became far, far away impossible dozens of times a year within logistics or geographic dire conditions. No cells- no phone-and group contact zero. Very different than now in the whole sense of what ""safety"" comprises.It loses a star in generalizations. OF COURSE, not all people fit like a puzzle piece in the category of their named generation. And some of us are complete outlier. For instance, I am nearly the opposite of my group in a few characteristics (revolt against authority/ sexual mores etc.) and was nearly for my entire life a minority ethnic too for nearly every living group or residence. When this book puts me in vast majority status by USA demographics. So the stats for me, were almost completely opposite in numerous categories for the USA as a whole as what I lived. But there are always quite a few that don't fit into their category generation much at all in every group. One of my sons doesn't. He could have been a Silent. Grabbed more responsibility at 12 than some do at 26 now.I read this to learn about the ""polars"" because all my grandchildren are Generation Z except for a 2 year old who will be post-Covid born ""Polar"".

This will be the complete opposite situation to that common one.Because I thought this book was terrific. Did I believe at any point that it was 5 star literary marvel or that it was one out of 500 in best plotting. NO! But it was clever, timely, and also instructive to a 5 star level. And it didn't suffer fools. You did NOT get over and over explanations to the thought patterns of the primes. But you did get their actions and words (McKenzie's dialogues are 5 star in nearly all her books). MUCH appreciated, in this particular era of tell and tell and tell. This book was the show, not the tell. I enjoyed this book to a 5 star level. There were times in Chicago (former century) that this brought to memory. Not at all that varied either from these scenarios at all.Because most humans are not toward the upper levels of commerce, politics, marketing, entertainment just ""there"" because they excelled. Nope. Which will seem not an intuitive approachable reality for many readers for this genre or time either. Women readers, most especially. Because you have heard endlessly such a different message for at least 20 years now. Essentially nearly an opposite one to the one this book demonstrates. But one that is nevertheless more actual in participation of experiences for the period of 40 or 50 years ago. Many women's experiences of excelling or ""doing it all"". Both. Because women ARE visible and exactly like these women in ""Please Join Us"". More so too, on the other sides of the glass ceilings. Now and then. Never saints, and always savvy. Nicole's voice was also excellent. And not angry. KUDOS. She actually loved her husband and respected him. Which at times makes many aspects of her workplace or success situations at that level HARDER, not easier. Loved the plot. And won't tell you a thing about it. But as a life long non-joiner of sorority to PTO or children activity hierarchies- this book was hugely appreciated. I've found that almost all group think mantra or loyalty is festered within these exact types of under pining agendas. In education or corporation or ""fellow workmate well met""- regardless there is the ""must do"" attitude or politico best. And if you are not on the slate with that, you become less- sometimes rather quickly. Group think today is the worst I have seen in 75 years at that. It's almost to a point now of you not being able to think or decide at all (right, wrong, appropriate, respect worthy) individually but being told what to think from childhood to grave. Altogether the most unputdownable read so far this summer out of many. I would never have accepted that invitation but I loved Nicole's ""out"" when she woke up. NYC for sure. And believe it or not Chicago at high levels of nearly every enterprise (business, altruistic, boards, LLC's, Unions, Education) has women that OUTDO men in these types of long term planning of the nefarious nature. Both good (legal) and bad (illegal) ones, at that. It is not a ""flip"" or swearing world either. It's a ""downtown"" world that is not at all that far fetched here.

The characters are chiseled down to the immense minutia of their lives.

And so much of her ""action"" in plotting forms and pace too; they are around hear-say, gossip, friend or peer or work mate ambiance slips etc. So truthfully as MY reaction, there are NO people in any of her books I have read so far that seem close to reliable or good intent prime or not narrators. There is always (even the good intent) some double face frontage in comparison to the inner voice. But she can create them. And in believable absurdities too. They aren't too far fetched which is a mercy for the bilge in this general genre category. That being the domestic or modern relationship/crisis type of psychological thriller. Be it action prone or not.But it takes me TOO long to read them because of her verbosity. So I will space a few out this year. But she HAS talent and they are really worth it if you are a young Mom, any aged striving to find places of both interest and/or monetary in real world work, know disappointments in many middle life crisis or husband/ teen ager woes. Does she know them!At page 76 I knew all the connections between the characters for the affair, death aftermath etc. and about 1/2 of them for Franny. So reading some s now?

I'm not at all embedded in the writing style after 20% read- and am truly tired of the lectures. Charlie is interesting and worth a read. But much more so for those who were never there. Because many of us who have lived through ""interesting"" times, KNOW it doesn't tell like a history book filled with aftermath platitudes. Being old, it has its drawbacks and also has some joys. Even for those of us in more than average good health. But most of the advice and preaching going on here is valid at any age. That's true. But I don't believe it is perpetually possible to live in the moment. If you ALWAYS do, you do NOT get to over 100- that's for sure. Sort of ironic that all of the emotive and effusive seem to adore the philosophy of stoics within this book.

No Kleenex for me.So far this year, I think I have tried ""old"" people book characters a few times too many. Some are actually realistic and interesting. This would be a worthwhile read for most people, especially those who don't know any real history. What they are teaching in many schools, is not much of it at all. History is a piece of its own times and mores and opinions in their proper context and not filled with omissions. And for the last century, also held huge positive advancements in nearly everything physical or mental. Not only for humans. Some of us do remember the days when the ice man came for our ice boxes.

And yet other parts of this book don't deserve a 2 star. He tries to make this ""funny light"" or ""savvy humor"" stand up comedy quip in lengthy portions. Which for me at points (maybe 20 in all) almost made the top of my head come off. Not funny as I am used to funny! It's sarcasm and ridicule cored and NOT of the raw real either (like a George Carlin, for example)- but what passes for humor since about 2015 or so. It laughs AT, not with. And that was a 1 or 2 star habit for me, especially in the light of long ago biography or most other aspects of innovators etc. Who is he to judge? The author, I'd guess- omnipotent Kean.BUT, the tales here! AND also the science! The reality of life's journey in many inventors, innovators, investigation prone humans- it TRULY is stranger than fiction. And most suffered immensely for their core investigations, hobbies, life's work in a lab or back room etc. So that was 4.5 stars and some of that was 5 stars. Yet at the same time, IMHO, there was an entire chapter or two, maybe three- that didn't belong at all. The title intersect is also fairly inexact? For instance, the entire Art World section, which had zero to do with DNA beyond a shape of a helix? And the Art masters cored are not anywhere near helix drawing prone types of any study relationship! In fact, I don't see any investigation into their brains in autopsy or any other faction of comparison to DNA code much either. Well that's just a minor irk but it is only 1 of 4 or 5 strange inclusions- in the way he ""relates"" subjects to each other. And non-withstanding that there were strong portions of history for two bright stars of past intense advancement in this field that were Church clergy- he still never passes a chance to dig any intellectual heel in the gut of the Catholic Church either. Mendel and Sister Miriam merely two of many. It is very WELL worth the read. I recommend it. But understand the vast coverage and know you will read, see much of dire human past and individual sufferings. I never knew how sick Darwin was all his days, for instance. But for me, the real star was lost in some of the assumptions of past judgment AND future projections that the author makes too.

Also with the least plotting re the usual police procedural which is most often the Guido Brunetti fare. And this I also loved. As it is jammed to the top with memory. Not only Guido's but his brother's. And also the loyalties, memories of some well known (after 30 other books) and also new characters. But not too many- maybe 5 individuals total.People from Guido's youth- neighbors. And the Countess, his mother-in-law has a large role, as well. Memories all entwined and much philosophical thought as the pandemic and so much void, isolation or failures in business and the courses they have lain, are more fully revealed.Venice, her buildings and artifacts shone here too. Many walks and rides with Foa. Plus there were Paola and Chiara deep conversations at several points in this particular novel. Wistful and exactly of this period of time. Superb.Yet, with all the deep carves of characters, she did manage to get in her hits. Vitriol to sarcasm- the whole template of dissing is here. Against the Church first. And not as well done against corruption and the insidious reality of government or charity or societal on the whole; the process of tax or donated with the clever ""accounting"" of money just flittering away. Where? And not a sure tale in any sense of where it has gone either. Since the purposes for it are still more needing than ever. But Leon sure does make her point. My city and state (USA) is much worse for this. Do I understand the processes used here. Perfectly. And the group at the Questura that we love the most (his 4 officers and secretary of most intimate cases experience) all contrive to do much of the same. Because they aren't playing by the ""rules"" either. So Italian. So Venetian! And yet near the end she has some paragraphs to posit about the voids left after God belief is gone. Missing it. And the measures of memory in which it was so whole and operative and busy with purpose. LOL! At 80 plus, I do think Leon has begun to protest too much for quite deep reasons.And Elettra is also here in key power. Her little response of ""me""! I won't forget that at all. Nor the dementia ridden Admiral who is so loyal and so very decimated by media. So unfairly, and so common in this exact period and for over a decade already. Leon hasn't lost a single brain cell there either. She has noticed.Well, I missed this Give Unto Others when it was new and read #32 first. (Looking at the dates, I was super busy with so many changes then.) Just saying this as advice- I would never start the series with either of those (#31 or 32). Character and past history is nearly essential to understand how well these characters are aged and how much they fit the times. Without that you are left half out of the emotion or the baggage.Lastly- hardly the least food reveals or delights of any Brunetti. Just a risotto. Bummer. Memories sided with current nasty attack have left who is a friend and who is NOT a friend- very core during the mask removals of after Covid. Something ALL of us just old or very old humans consider almost frequently, IMHO. You've had a long time to decide.Probably one of the worst generalization and most unfair paragraphs about Roman Catholic education that I have ever read.

This is the third book this week I've read which has mental illness of grave dimensions as the core. And in all three cases, they are written by a friend, family member, witness in the trenches- and not at all by the DSM5 diagnosis individual.There DOES inlay a specific problem. Using association and/or extreme closeness of relationship to publish another's story. In most cases, the world being what it is- I feel this can almost always be justified- despite some sufferers themselves saying it is unfair. This time, as his Mother, most certainly the biggest ""well, ok"" of the 3. Best Minds and The Elissas: Three Girls -it isn't even a family member. Well, only a few posters seem to see this book too, in that slant of witness- not schizophrenia sufferer. Regardless, that can be as terrible as the perceptions and the disease fallouts themselves. Many times individuals cannot make rational decisions for themselves. Can you guess which day they can and which they can't? But some demand an almost strictly critical and measured decision EVERY TIME and EVERY DAY. If you have not walked in their shoes- I don't understand the immense critical nature of judgments from the outside.Saying all that, this particular book was the Mother's story. Terribly sad, and filled with all types of personal information. Some was better than most. Some not. I think she communicated how blindsided they all became. That's the most horrendous aspect, to me, that the onset of this is so often from 18-24 and just as expectations become decimated.I learned a little about meds and their extreme inconsistencies and terrible (common) side effects.Most of her emotional battles had to do with family relationships and much else that I really didn't want to know SO much about. Seeing that housing and much else of monetary situations was WAY above average for this situation in any country or location? And other factors too, made it a slog at points. Sad and very difficult regardless. Yet, hard to embed at the same time. Lots of times it is apples compared to oranges and not apple/apple comparisons. At least this book told and shown (both) much of the reality of daily perceptions for a person with this form of schizophrenic illness. I also learned about that group of doctors that don't even believe it is an illness or disease. And the quacks with all types of food or mental exercises remedies. Oh if it were only so easy.

I wonder if any of you remember when they used to give VG's as B grades.The protagonist detective, Cassie, is so much a real possible person. That's becoming rarer in this genre all the time. But Montana itself is also the STAR of her setting. It taught me several geographic and demographic facts too. Butte, Bozeman, Anaconda- they come alive. And different from each other. The copper mining of the early last century key too. This wasn't just surface stuff either, it was deeper.There are 3 plots going on and two of them related and they meet close to the end. The last much minor one has to do with a Treasure Hunt scenario and it is resolved a bit after the more dire criminal circumstances. There is gunfire and also subterfuge. Big time and small time evil, as well. I thought the various levels of ""bad"" truly delightful. Not at all always ""what you see is what you get"" either. But of those of you averse, there is murder done to a higher body count than just 2. All by others, not Cassie. And only 1 is self-defense.Of course, the timing switches nearly a dozen times. (Three days before, a month before, two months after etc.) and because of how it was done, it did work. Very little redundancy and yet it was not complex all that much either. Everyone who can read will figure out who and where quite easily.But the mix was above average and the people more actual/ real possibles than any of the last 10 I've read in this genre. There is one extremely bad, bad individual. But he sure doesn't work his way in voids. The distances driven too are as wide as the views are awesome of the mountains.

Yes, even some of his assumptions and conclusions were interesting, even when they were context ""off"". This type of personal history and background too. It lends itself to many moments for pondering, and a few times for some powerful aspiration core possibilities. Yet, as a practicing Catholic and one who worked within Roman Catholic education for at least 20 years of my life? At points I was appalled. Well, some of this belief definition or generalizations, they are just wrong. Also put into context of mind-boggling misinformation with generalizations. And no more so than his Pope Francis summations and interpretations. And also at the same time he puts much more emphasis on (for 2023 or any time IN my lifetime and I'm 75) things like indulgences or 1000 year old past human failures. And negativity/ failures of current times too.This could get very long, and I will try to be as brief as I am capable of being when this is so core. But his mindset, from the beginning, was NOT in pilgrimage notch. It wasn't. Timothy Egan is primarily and always through this entire journey, about Timothy Egan. Which puts the emphasis and the openness almost entirely backwards for a pilgrimage of spiritual growth. It's far simpler than he makes it out to be, too. What he believes he is seeking? Faith is not ONLY faith (so that the intellect is pacified?) or as other agnostics would define either. And Catholics believe in acts MATTER beyond their faith alone, regardless. He gets the appearances of religious core practice and little else to its FAITH components from the get go. Faith is something you live by obeying the 10 commandments and loving your neighbor. Actually, I've been many of the places he trod. And this made me sad overall. Because it is rather obnoxious too when someone pretends to this extent that they hold understanding and knowledge, when they don't. His mother's experience is common. Our intellects and emotions gave/give a ""dark night of the soul"" to many saints. They LIVED their faith, that is what mattered. And will in the end. Emotions are like bodies- merely temporary. Egan misses the boat on the core of spirituality nearly completely, while giving huge copy to all atrocities and almost entirely leaving out the good. 1000's of hospitals, schools, and libraries merely the tip of the iceberg for charity over 2000 years. And in some ages, it was the only home of recorded knowledge and refuge for women, as well.It somewhat reminds me of revisionist history which neglects ever aspect of positive change and lists every negative as if they all existed in a vacuum.

There is a considerable body count. Reacher of course has a role. But, of course, you never ""see"" him and none of the dozen times two players ever do either.

Kim's sister's boyfriend is on duty on the border and away from MI. What does that portend for the future?Sometimes, just a few, I do get sick of Kim Otto's fears of flying and helo complaints.

Carl is one of the best characters I've read in all the huge numbers of Scandinavian area books for many decades. (Probably I've read hundreds and Hannah is one of the few characters I can recall distinctly. And most were Norway, Sweden or Finland with just a few Iceland locales thrown in, not a fraction as many Denmark.) I just identify with and love Carl's work ethic base ideas per output. Especially considering the injuries, trauma he has endured per work years. Especially within the administration policies required criteria bilge. Not being a fan of the vile laden and horror at all- I'm surprise at myself for lasting the length of this one. It's much more horror principles genre than policing, IMHO. But the Danish character and outlook of these two (Assad also) primes- it was unique and superb. As good as any dozen ""odd couple"" partners or peers or coworkers I've come across in years and years of reading. I did laugh out loud.Dept. Q and their cabal and corrupt unique finance/ funding is exactly the kind of authoritative animal I'm the most familiar with- so this truly hit my interest and I was totally embedded. Especially since Assad has no real credentials or particular labeled skill formal education for the roles he played. As in real life, sometimes the least formally taught have the best skills and most important in the now type savvy and knowledge.I do not recommend this book for those who don't like or cannot tolerate dark, incredibly horrid or evil situations of long time tortures- or if you are a 90% cozy reader.

As much as she designates types and categorizes- the gist and the copy are extremely repetitive. The Whistleblower chapter and aftermath of such was 4 star, nearly 5. They suffer. Greatly and never do you hear about numerous real world and cultural bias reactions in the aftermaths of payback.

It's (arrogance and inappropriate flip) revealed the most in her various chartings and reaction in the chartings' columns. But come on. Beyonce and other various tastes for entertainment etc.(among other entirely irrelevant criteria) do not belong in the seriousness of the prime copy here. Being so core knowledgeable to the exact cases (especially the Dixon IL story and that documentary that I have seen- it was a 3 as well) and every single place she visits/ resides/ mentions in IL and in the Chicagoland area- made a BIG difference for me in reading this book. As compared to other posters here. The one highlighted core case of fraud listed and described too was in Englewood (Chicago neighborhood) where I was actually born and lived. And because of that, I do understand her paranoia and suspicion completely. They are quite often more than justified. Regardless, she does not write well at all. White collar crime of every single type has become endemic. (Not only in the big welfare haven cities either.) This is just the tip of the iceberg in Chicago. Even the ""honest"" hold almost no objective moral values. (10 commandment values being OBJECTIVE moral values.) A mindset exists which holds HUGE personal subjectively to ""mine"" or any version of entirely selfish right or wrong based principles. If any item becomes lost or in any avenue of minute diversion over-looked - it is available for snatching. Write offs for business and expense account reimbursements are a joke, they are so universal and flagrant cheats. And the few honest people, as I am- are continually falling over cheats in doing ANY accounting process for various jobs in that category, nearly everywhere. From a drugstore to an educational campus. And I've held such exact jobs for 40 plus years and within different decades and centuries at that. It got worse in the 2000's. Indiana is even putting men's socks and underwear under lock and key cases now. Stealing without consequence and virtually approved has overcome. So I read his book because of my own witness history. And also because of how this in larger and larger degrees of others calling this ""white-collar"" crime with almost no retribution or, if any, prison or even service required level consequences. It's far more than that- this collapses entire systems. It's the reason entire huge areas have no stores and no hope. Any types of stores. Time and again- some ventures try. But only for months. All is carried away. Not even a carnival can exist. It was flash mobbed last weekend and moved away in a day very near to me.

And what has truly changed in law and access since Alice did all her negotiations and suits against/ within the dual court systems of her day? (Ingenious system by the way- and that is why English law is so often copied in types.) If you believe that women were voiceless before their first emancipations or votes in the last century- you NEED to read this book. Wealth was only a meager start to the climb. And you absolutely cored the whole journey on having the mind of a lawyer, financial entrepreneur savvy coupled with the arts of guile AND complete objectivity (not subjective feelings of like/dislike much either). And mates/ spouses not at all chosen by attraction but by realities.I do NOT recommend this book to those who only want to hear about the plays, the music, the progress (Elizabeth I) parties etc. You need to know that entire chapters are given to jointure rights and how they were obtained. And how 2nd and 3rd marriages spliced into the inheritance law and custom. Plus why the money and value WERE what they WERE. This is the only book in at least 3 dozen categories that gives you the present day pound and dollar value for goods, servants, dowries, tenant rents, vast estate maintenance etc. etc. Your mind will be boggled. During the last year of Elizabeth I's life they (Alice and her second husband) spent more than 5.5 million dollars on a 3 day party for Queen Elizabeth's visit to their place. And it was not at all unusual to have more than 48 servants for Alice and her three daughters alone- on other such estate visits when they were all still ""at home"" status before their own marriages. How could a wool farmer's daughter have done such a thing as live this life? Read this book. From the highest realms of art, literature, music, playwrights and poets' patronage as just an aside or two. I would LOVE to see her tomb. Designed and contracted by herself. Be warned that the associates of their (the 4 Spencer women) different ages are not all kindly Earls, Counts or Knights. Woman had their VOICES heard but in very different ways then they do now. And some of the time- the advantages were to THEM in comparison to the women alive presently, IMHO. Medicine being what it was- the fall outs for multi, successive marriages were vastly different too. Kudos to this author. She has to be a top notch detective just to get the meaning out of the verses that have been kept. Or letters, or law documents or church records etc. Endless footnotes/ references. I wouldn't mind meeting her at all either. Masterful eyes. As good as the one on Philby- Spy among Friends (Ben Macintrye) And I found this book entirely serendipity too while waiting for the other Mah Jongg players to show up. Best unknown to me find of the year for sure. I could NOT put this book down. If you are interested in James I or Charles, his son- their different styles of reign?

But that can be forgiven too- because the tone, pace, depths of trying to wheat farm or ranch within detail minutia in desert South Australia during this period was constant. The locale and the core dozen folks never being obscured or leaving the whole locale or period as a one piece tale.And that's a difficult thing to achieve with these many folks and so wide a place for natural consequence AND adventure. Depending upon how you define adventure. Some of the aspects (Minna was one) seemed to be added just for the steamy scenes. But still overall the time, place, and natives to settlers- all well embedded/ entwined and just a good tale.Sharpness of the writing without constant circular placement or descriptive introductions to switching eye narrators or locations could be honed better by this author. I do hope she improves. Denny, Tai and Mary were all 3 done to 4 star levels. Brava! And she also kept the entire huge stage setting all of one piece to time and place. She didn't give them revisionist agendas or attitudes or dialogues. With these many characters, that is not a given either. But the prose flow doesn't reach past 3.5 stars, IMHO.

And at multiples of multiples variants of times in history or past or association, or slants of their DOGMA (that especially)- it doesn't seem to vary or matter, IMHO. Some souls are fused to special connections ""possible"". And oftentimes it is entirely attitude and acceptance and JOY (much as she describes a possibility to core yourself through many habits of mind and reactions)- to changing your entire thought pattern habits too- that is key. The belief or non-belief of God's messages or presences, angels and 100 other entities of reality in this ""attitude"" is the main concern in almost all the s. If you believe. If you have faith. If you are spiritual. But this, although simplistic and not written top notch either, book begins to relay how thought pattern with love and joy consistently of thought pattern reaction- how all of that produces.I've been near death twice- and never had the ""white light"" etc. or welcome as so often described. But I did have out of body placement and knowledge of things going on that I could never have seen from where I was. Mary C. Neal has a few perceptions and beliefs that may help you understand great sorrow, as well. Or trials that we were never strong enough to surmount. Lastly, it truly bothers me that very religious people and other aspects of strong belief in  are SO CORED on DOGMA of religion organization and rigidity of all their definitions. Those are all absolutely cored on human flawed interpretations over millennia.Worth a read for the issue of change and deciding different path directions for your own wholeness alone.

And Turkey, for other reasons, I can see. Just curious.He interprets far less than some of these other s assume or suggest. He usually has excellent posits to support any stated position. Very little is theory of agenda slant. Most of it is logic, cultural thought to traditional mores/ placements, patterns of the past still working or not- and portents of same or not in aptitudes for that physical reality.Geography matters. I was especially enthralled by his Iran, Greece, Ethiopia discourses. Because there is SO much there I didn't fully know or realize for past realities. Or factual placement stances now, as well.

Natural world possibilities or IMPOSSIBILITIES remain.

Approximately 100 priests are official exorcists in the USA presently and Pope Francis has further expanded/ structured the ritual and prayer forms.

It is very, very rare and histrionic mentally ill can and do exhibit something quite often which is totally different, but which can look similar.

And other exactly parsed witnessed lengths for the speaking/ translations of ancient Greek, Latin, Aramaic by individuals who never heard a word of it.

You will also hear the words/ stories of some Richard Gallagher's close associates over the years and in many locations. And most of these people are not at all or ever were Roman Catholic who have /hold possession. It also goes through the paths that many branches of Christianity and other religions (Judaism, Islam, Hindu especially) use for helping the afflicted with this condition. And I must add, not a one of them is always successful. Gallagher has strong evidence and somewhat of proof that most victims he has investigated/ helped made mental or emotional deals with Satan or a total negativity entity when young. And why doing a prayer blessing or some other group layperson assisted ceremony is not a good idea. Just this decade a 100 lbs woman threw the minister and several others all the way across a gym and hurt one very badly.

And I enjoy her Guido/ Paola books overall to react in dozens of paragraphs. Venice itself usually gets at least 10. Leon is 80. I sure hope this isn't her last one. You never want to end in a dud.Not this time. This  will be shorter. Because the enjoyment was nearly nil in reading. In fact, it took me a week with at least a dozen ""come back to its"" for me to finish it. It holds some of the most superb metaphor comparisons of paragraphs lengths though. The one in which Paola's facials are the Cobra and Guido's mind/ response expression is the Mongoose. 6 stars. That is EXACTLY the reality of the social warrior physicality in action.But the tone here and the plot? And the amount of dissing the church, nunneries, democracy, capitalism. I won't list all her usual rant targets. But my guess is that she let herself screed repeatedly about anything more conservative than Marx to make up for having the need in plot for Guido to indict a mover and shaker of the Red Brigades. Separating herself (author and Brunetti's both) from the actual Left of murder and destruction? (Not to speak of the 100's of millions killed by 20th century authoritarian Communism.) For all of them (all the Brunetti's), and especially for Paola- that is laughable. So elite brand hypocritical too. And by Italian political ""standards"" of ridiculous dichotomy in this one! Kidnapping being just one Italian specialty. Guido is sad. The kids are stereotyped again. (One the vegetarian, the other the mass eater.) And this is the first Leon book that has truly disappointed me. No less so than in the family interactions at that. This book was like a series of check offs for virtue signaling that Leon could include from a list. Not at all up to the par of family and friends at dinner either. Far more insular than that.Please, get off of the politics, Donna. Please! In Italy yet. You don't need to go back to the 1980's either. And if you need to do your usual multi-page Catholic Church snark and run- at least remain an equal opportunity religion hater while you are at it. The Buddha has had his difficulties too, you know.But overall, this #32 was the least of the last 20. Not just in plot, but in tone and energy. Both. Meanders too and if you have not read this series? Please, do NOT start here with this one. Two big disappointments too. Mentioning the Conte early in the book and he never shows. (Love him.) And Elettra shows up SO late. And then when she mentions the triangulation method, it isn't the MCA (Most Common Ancestor- DNA base) one that is right now turning Cold Cases upside down. It's a composite within a social media parlance to do similar cross overs, but not at all the supreme ""seeker"" for identity. I expect she will figure the rest (MCA of DNA databases triangulation) out by herself.PLEASE- give Guido other than the social welfare warrior fare that YOU want to rant over repeatedly yourself, Donna. And I thought you would be one of the few who refrained. Silly me.Our Sorella was the best character in this one.

Lippman is a favored author and I've read many of hers. Stands alone especially, as I am not that big on Tess. When I was in Baltimore back in the day I even went to the dive/ coffee house where she was said to sit and write (Spoons). This one didn't fly and tried to be too many books in one. A semi-who dun it but beyond that a domestic thriller or a modern ""what's going on"" piece? Well, for me, it didn't succeed to a full extent in any of those. It's a 2.5 stars novel made slightly better by the back knowledge level of Baltimore, New Orleans- those two locales especially. IMHO, they were done much better than the people were.There is so much repetition upon Meredith that I got fed up enough to speed read in her sections. It's hard to believe a doctor, even a plastic surgeon, could be that shallow. And I knew from before the half that she was hiding all her own cards and playing as much a role as Joe. Every person of major paragraph after paragraph of their thoughts, labels, car trips, and restaurant foraging- all of them- TOTALLY SOULESS. From Lippman? Is she gone as faithless as I think she has?Regardless, the ending did NOT shock me as it did others from their reactions. And just from the main pivots of what they THOUGHT WAS IMPORTANT here? Purely existing for prestige scales and pleasure and facade- every single one. But even more disappointing was the level of category for Lipmann's opinion being trotted out time and again for a 4 or 5 page soliloquy upon various opinionated politico, decore trends, $1000 pairs of shoes, age appearance, etc. etc. etc. (I could go on and on and on too with categories alone.) And in doing so she also makes VAST generalizations. Re workers, Boomers, parents, having kids or extra anything- even down to having a character vote for anything that doesn't make him a result of the aftermath. Selfish and self-serving only apply. And every single one was an elitist view as IF they were working class. LOL! From blue collar Baltimore background too! She has DEFINITELY experienced a values scale switch.Too long of a reaction, I know. But REALLY, such a good writer wasting all that time on these people without souls or even consciences? COVID must have really done a job on her. To write an entire novel only filled with total users! Laura Lippman yet!And she didn't even begin to address the pack of lies told in every phase of COVID either! She skirted the tip of that control (and then change the ""truth"" story) iceberg only once or twice. And yet raised a few poignant crux posits for the period merely in passing. (But didn't at all even mention the lock downs much worse in other states- like not even being able to go out on a boat alone in Mi- or having the seed aisle crossed with tape barriers. LOL.) Only a few real glitch crossovers for present group think madness were included, and they WERE barely there. (Like the one on the Mardi Gras character design in N.

It is subjective memory. This is never ALL exposure of Mineko by Mineko. But it approaches portions of ""self"" many memoirs do not.And also this memoir holds more than a tad of historical significance. It was nearly the end of an era for ""the flowers and willow"" world. Certainly it is not held in such exact precise formalities and rigid forms of specific nomenclatures and entertainment methods as it was during Mineko's reign. She was her parents' 11th and last child- although she never knew some of her siblings. 3 sisters at least had been sold/given to the meiko/ geiko world house world in routes to Geisha world preparations. She was adored and pampered, her parents were not usual. But she WAS an unusual girl with some unusual habits. By the time she was 5 she was immersed away from her home within the structure that would groom her to be the prime inheritor of the entire house/business/ art/ kimono designer/ structured dance pavilion structures etc. As such, she was precious (called that too) and held immense power and privilege over all the others in that establishment. Within HUGE structures of pecking order, at 6 or 7 years of age- she was #1 despite all the rules she needed to obey. Mineko (they changed her name) could tell adults 40 years older than she where she was going to sit or eat. Knocked the former #2 right out of her seat. And sometimes even sleep. Very much like the Prince of Wales in a 14th century court- only the head was above her. People couldn't even start eating until she did. Very structured life and more than considerable requirements of dance, musical instrument, formal layers of dress/ makeup/ hair etc. toward the physical. At points she was so strained and frankly sick that she was down to 86 lbs. The outfit and adornment alone weighs close to 40-45 lbs. But reading this whole, made me realize how very altered between cultures the real modus / mores/ crux beliefs/ ideas of fun, appreciation of the physical world CAN differ. Not only differ but be almost judged by entirely different scales of eyes. Not only for a moral right or wrong, but for a sense of what is ""norm"" or what is not. Or what is order. Or what is not.Mineko is an outlier regardless. It was well worth the read. I understand her attempt and skill in relating the actual reality/ core purposes and lessons of her life. She shared far more than most would. But I don't believe this is even half of that world's stage and outcome effects. Kimonos could cost more than houses and each was individual. Ones ""given away"" to younger meiko or geiko always carried the knowledge and referral name of the former original owner.I would have never lasted to 29. She seems to have determined much of her own life purposely since. But I would have appreciated far more than just into the year 2000. But here is also a more than decent view into the last half of the 20th century within Kyoto world- especially for the world in the 1950's and 1960's just post war defeat. The photos were 5 stars. I wish there had been more of them. This is also the first accounting I have ever read that reveals how all the money end works. Envelope paths etc. It's exact and also complex.

And Shirley Hazzard lived for lengths in every hemisphere/ continent which hold city populations. Her husband writes his own portion and perspective of the overall. He highlights SO excellently the nuance of Naples itself. Most core during his hospital, medical experiences after getting violently hurt (very seriously hurt) during a motorcycle encounter while being robbed of the bag he was holding in which he was dragged. This is well worth the read. Only in Italy would they worry about your mental state first. I'm exaggerating but not by much.This TRULY was delightful for me to read. Naples is the only place in my entire life when I was FULLY aware, the entire time I was there- that there were 100 different layers and conversations of all ilks going on not just then but for millennia.

Parts of this novel truly turned me off. The couple had traits too, that didn't attract for me as they did obviously SO MUCH for Shirley. Also there are many portions in half French, half Italian, one quarter English which you will need to reread. I understood the French more than I understood the Italian idiom or phrase.Regardless, I have decided after now after having read most of her stuff that I like her fiction FAR MORE than her non-fiction or semi-non-fiction.

But primarily about posturing, affected and emotionally flawed individuals. Mainly from the upper classes but holding entirely nil amounts of joy or unfettered good intent. Hazzard's work will stand the tests of time. The angry complaint quotient is nearly equal to our own times (post 2010). But with less true classiness, that tries to appear AS class. She posits juxtapositions of her time well from her own points of view and her distracted or imposed upon females. And you know it throughout. Work being ""important"" only at the top levels. Most of these stories are interesting, but do not expect core honesty or any traces of humor or assuming the best within them. Or respect for chores, tasks, work well done but not of the verbal or theory level administration modes or artistic world groups. The more I have read Shirley Hazzard the more I have come to the conclusion that she is almost exactly the type of woman I have come over decades to avoid.

Without the form issues and a couple of cheap shot politico lectures, I would have given it a 4 star overall.Why?Because it was insightful and also filled with detail. Singapore itself! And the women's lives of such myriad context of minutia and wider crux. BOTH! You rarely find both in the same fiction novel.The continuity of reading became nearly humorous. No breaks, and no context ""between"". You are with one character and numerous placement people and all of a sudden you are within another duo's conversation about half a neighborhood away. This book kept me rereading entire half pages to know who was in the dialogue NOW. But the story was prime to this place and this era. Just this week I was reading a listing (it was NOT entirely statistically true to scales of ""value"" because I did read about its sources too)- which has Singapore as the highest single residence (any size) housing cost in the entire world. Knowing others (Japan, NYC, London, Paris etc.) - I did doubt it. But depending upon how you figure the economics' ""values""- it is surely in the top 5.So these women come from Filipino locations poverty. As do other maids and workers. They do so because of the money they make to send home. The laws in all of Singapore would be abhorrent to many citizens who have more individual rights in their countries. But reading some of these posters!!! They have no idea how much worse some of these migrants have it at home. That's why they are willing to do the ""papers' tests"" etc. And within China itself or Myanmar Asia- these women are often not fed AT ALL and are literally slaves worked to death in ""bad hans"" category of lineage or politico genocides. Finding the outrage upon the invisibility treatment a fair judgment, I still do not understand some of the posters for this book. The Communist and authoritarian country worlds are not nice places if you are the ""wrong"" type, group or ancestry. Let alone your own actions being held for consequences. TERRIBLE ones. And that was not the only issue that readers' s do not ""get"" either. They do not ""get"" the degree of law in Singapore (you can be jailed for spitting alone). Nor the religious or the heritage factors within mores, either.The middle of the is book was by far the best part. Especially Donita's life- in both actions and in conscience. And overall the plot was good, but as I stated before- EXTREMELY hard to follow.Lastly, just a nugget from a good, good friend who was my doctor for 30 years. She was born in the Philippines and became a OB/GYN after migrating to Chicago. We were on the same bowling team too for nearly 2 decades. (She threw a crazy curve ball for a 100 lb. person.) She was a world traveler. Even went to the Artic and Galapagos at different times and all over South America nearly yearly. Returned East Asia every year too. And she LOVED Singapore, it was her favorite place in the world. She talked about the park jungle and the infinity pool on the top of the skyscrapper- Raffles, etc. all the time. She also did volunteer work there and in the Philippines until 5 years ago. She has since passed. But reading the tirades against Singapore that I read on these s over this book??? They are not accurate or valid judgmental value to the place as it IS now. Not at all. Discrimination is human and worldwide for working / lower working economics class people. It exists in the USA too. MORE NOW than ever in my own lifetime. FOR SURE. Lots of people believe working with their hands or service jobs are also way beneath them. And would rather take welfare for decades upon end than do the types of servant work described here in ""Now You See Us"". That's putting the value even lower in reality, IMHO.I'm glad I read it. Despite it taking about 3 times longer for the length than any fiction book I've read this year. Slow, slow going. Very outlier for me in fiction.

IMHO, if you love prose that crosses over into poetry or very aesthetic descriptive flights- you might with the ""feeling"" composite- rate this very high.It IS compelling. I got sucked in all the way to page 53 on a very late night start. But the beginning is more clear cut. Although even there- you have this stream of consciousness type of flouncing. Without a real structured sentence form either. Run-ons as if you can't take a breathe. But it didn't stop Faulkner, come to think of it.This is a 1956-59 period homestead story in Alaska, during the exact timing as it was trying for statehood status. An hour or two from Anchorage- in good weather that is (which means mostly summer). But the core focus of this is not just about the land ownership or the ""making a go"" for the homestead requirements. It's about the coupleship, the marriage- the connections. And those are huge. And who supports each partner. Flawed and filled with constant and repetitive emotional hurdles- not a bunch of them very happy feelings either. Lawrence is war aftermath and not what you'd ever call a communicator. LOL! Marie is running away from and (only my opinion) never running ""toward"" as much as any women I have ever known. And my age is not all that different. But 15 or so years DOES make an immense difference just then in that 20th century. So all those 5 stars for this one are from people who like to ride the HUMONGOUS effusion desperations of life and have most of their core in loving their own reaction to feelings. I'm not either of those quantities. But I can appreciate the writing skill and the locale, timely feel, exactness of the nuance and placements so embedded within this book. And are they.I wanted to give it a 4 star, at least. Truly I did. But I can't. So much is repetition of circling thoughts of inadequate core thinking. And I did not like the whole idea of marrying to avoid ANY home birth place or placement or any situation prior. If you like the idea of mail order or internet brides- you will probably like this more than I did. There was a real element in this couple that was VERY off putting to me.

Emergency Rooms have, IMHO, within the USA (even at trauma centers) degraded in protocols, exchanges of information, sustaining accurate prognosis or treatment etc. etc. (medications applied absolutely) since BEFORE the COVID period. I can't imagine what depths they have gotten to presently within a city of, just a thrown away figure, of say 2 to 5 million people in the city proper. Let alone in the density of NYC per square mile, as this was. I know Chicago's have. Even the highest status burbs' and BIG NAME hospitals- they have. Specialty treatment is one thing, emergency room quite another.This will give you an inkling of why. With simple, simple bottom line and very personal opinion and methods used from an emergency room doctor himself. On duty during the first to the last days of pandemic run- with all that encompassed. Having daughters-in-law and granddaughters and friends and step-daughter all being nurses. And a few Emergency Room nurses are in there too- this is mild in comparison to most reality. The step-daughter though- no longer a nurse- got burnt out after about 14 years and now works in a rescue pet facility. (She was bitten and spit upon too many times to count- and that is NO exaggeration.) Being the research person for cops and nurses in degree programs during the '90's - little surprises me. Have I heard the tales! But overall tech itself, digitalizing, all the various computer cross overs, putting many medical associations into big packs of administration ""head"" and P R advertising? All of those things lead to the ""know betters"" never ""knowing better"". Most especially about equipment, placements, or utility of access. In anything, really- but the paper and the theory talk. So this book will give you a bit of an insight into all that.This will be helpful for you too, if you do not know any of the procedure methods and protocol for very quick death scenes or telling individuals the very worst news they are ever going to hear.

Absolutely one of the best non-fiction books I've read in the last 5 years. In that category of ALL non-fiction- this would be in the top 3 for the last 20 years.Exact and precise writing which gives clear and chronological progressions. Not only to her ""hobby"" but to the events and processes which contain the purposes and steps of inquiry which will result in a triangulation of data which will lead to the MRCA in a DNA content study. MRCA is the Most Recent Common Ancestor. When this person has been plotted, you are THEN able through records and other research (some of it is tech biological based too) to go downwards through the generations of descendants to place the possible DNA matches. First you will need to find 2, 3, or even better- possibly 4 DNA match relatives of snips- SNP profiles. It is reflected in a count of compatible DNA to a degree in language that can be expressed in numbers of ""alike"". Now I know what all those cm decimals mean. Barbara Rae-Venter can do this for a baby completely abandoned/ unknown- dead or alive. From 50 years ago or last week. For adopted humans of every age wanting to know their birth names or parents etc. But even more, for any number of reasons for living humans who want to know their histories, when most have a complete blank. Or to solve closure of missing persons' identities for those they have left behind, never knowing their outcomes.She is brilliant. Has a ""grasshopper mind"" which surrounds inquiry and knowing to detail of depth. She will continue and continue until ALL that can be known will be known. That she eventually got embedded within the criminal justice system by happenstance is no surprise. NONE. That this came out of retirement whimsy time spent, this doesn't surprise me at all either.This book is a high recommendation for ALL. Read it. She writes as well as she thinks. And if you are not a science buff in any sense, MORE SO- read this. Barbara spent most of her adult life as a biological product patent lawyer. Most of it in Texas and CA. BUT- she was born in New Zealand.Fabulous book. This is not just about the case mentioned in the title. There are 5 or 6 other criminal inquiries detailed to a T. All of them from inquiries done from 2015 until today. Most of which are between 15 and 35 or 40 years old cases of unknown victims. She has even deciphered the original name of a 150 plus year old 2 year old found in an air tight casket (buried in the 1870's) while a house was being built. She has help now. Mostly doing internet searches to the people in the ""count down and locale"" that are possible descendant paths. And always had at least 10 different sites to peruse and search and download and combine to ""eliminate"" or ""must be"" paths. She also has aides as of this current last 2 years who do internet, obituary, leg searches on geographic locations or telephone work for her now. Paul Holes is just one of the names for the 5 or 6 main law enforcement keys who have roped her into doing what she does- FOR THEM. The top three are now retired. Each doing their last ""close"" after up to 40 years of searching and never finding their perpetrators. I've read books by 3 to 4 of these associates but NONE OF THEM can write. Barbara can write too. Barbara has chapters on ethics. Magnificent. We are in the ""Wild West"" right now for being able to do some of these cross cut searches. GEDmatch and FamilyTreeDNA questions? Ancestry or 23 and Me? Read this, please. She actually has changed my mind about some very key permissions. We do have rights of privacy, for sure. But we do not have rights of invisibility? We are who we are. And we shed cells endlessly which state exactly who we are. Now DNA snips can be produced from hair shaft. One or two of her solves are hair shaft only at the beginning. The Boy under the Billboard story is 6 stars. There WERE people waiting for him to come home. Because I read of the women in the metal barrels before from the other side of law- this FINALLY made me understand how the man with 25 different names who killed all of them was established. And the outcome. She was so pivotal that she has been given dozens of honors. Her system devised through logic and practice has become now more copied. She gives praise and acknowledgment to all who are connected with her 1000's and 1000's of hours process. And deems that it has changed her too- since she never saw the depth of ""bad"" like this before in her life. She is a saint for the help she has given the truly bereft and those ignorant of their identity for which they NEED information. She listens and she searches. This is also done SO supremely well, that you little realize it- it is a memoir. Do I agree with all her feelings and summations? No. But I do for almost 95% of them, at least. She absolutely deserved to have a reserved seat at the Joseph DeAngelo sentencing. As I have also read I'll be Gone in the Dark and Unmasked- this book was like giving me new eyes to those who have gone before.

Just the time of usual grocery shopping morning.

My grandparents starved as pre-teens and teen-agers (actually ate the powdered stucco) so I fully realize the appreciation (endless) for this aspect of life where I have lived it- that alone. Not to speak of the choices for education, responses possible to sickness etc.Well-it is actually the last 50 or so pages that made this 5 full stars for me. You aren't going to get every happily tied into a conclusion knot. How she could have BEGUN to recite all the epochs (different entrapments and containments- or shipping her off with relative exchanges) of her life (under 37 years)? Enough gut wrenching separations, rejections and prisons too for any 5 humans to confront. How could she have even pulled all those miserable details up from memory TO translate. Or gotten to the schools that she did. 1000's of details and in dozens of separations from her most loved birth family. Never all together either. Her story is a remarkable outlier core individual- quite beyond the North Korean or Chinese placements.She could do no other than what she is resounding for today. Politically and individually. ""Justice, freedom and the family, these are the values I believe in!"" I cannot believe that people (posters) question this UK political placement!Lastly- a thought to consider. Read about current DAY slavery or books quite like this one (non-fiction) instead of the endless bilge in present decade supposedly ""historical fiction"" that composites past slavery. It is happening on every single continent and in/on every ocean on ships with no law or loyalties too. And the real CURRENT states of being bought and sold- as children and as adults- how that works within migrations and escapes too. Both men and women. Babies and kids. Not together within a family unit either. Middle men and middle ""guide"" women galore. It is happening today, and every day of 2023 at the Southern Border of the USA, as well. Who will print those histories of terrible and ""encouraged/ permitted"" journeys, let alone the ones from this type of persecution? What is the present cost of a 12 year old this week? Not the elite group think ""empathics"" of cozy place observations and various ""victimhood"" identities- that's for sure. They absolutely do not know the peso or dollar cost.Group think and the real substance to process of brainwashing propaganda is far, far from only being North Korea as a poster child for it. It is just one of many government overreach nightmares. It doesn't hide its sharing the poverty and ultimate human disappearing, quite as well as most of the others do.

And this book is NOT one of them. This is much closer to how they be. Not only in the present era either. Girlfriend bonds' books are also in major, major minority in numbers. So once again, this book is not ""general"" in either this genre or this period AT ALL.It reminded me of something written in 1965, despite the hook ups and other major 2008 plus posits and ploys. (The Group, but not.) And let me tell you, it wasn't the ""norm"" girl anywhere that joined the beat or the hippy lifestyle choices either, back in the day. Not even 5% by some stats. So don't believe all the history hype you have trotted out to you- post 2000 crowd.This is a trio of girls of 18 who have been best friends for going on 6 years and the tale of their summer in 2008 and then 10 years afterwards. I will tell you little more. Go in knowing the least you can. Please, do NOT read book synopsis of this AT ALL. Too many s here give entire scenarios too much input.IMHO, this is the only book that has come close to real life human for me (MY OWN READ) in many a moon. For this age group most absolutely- and I read a lot. And 18-23 was the group I worked with most in my past real life decades, as well. So I know of what I post. Also know that for most of you this will absolutely NOT be 5 stars. It's long and deeply wordy. You need patience. Most will give it 3 or 4. And it will not be quite an easy read either. Furthermore, it is truly not in the thriller or suspense category that the trailer appropriates either. It's much better than that fare. This also approaches Literary with the big L literary. That's how good- the dialogue, prose and time period postings are superb.I almost wanted to give it 4 stars just so that the next one she writes gets better. It's hard to believe this is her second- and the first one under Covid without much of sales. I'm sure Berman did NOT have to work summers or have 3 jobs at a time for schooling either. She has had some high flying location experiences, as well. But can she write, so some of that time had to be in doing it!These are VERY rich people from classes I have viewed close up in my life through business and/or work associations- but in which I have never belonged for a second. So be advised to take this  seriously if you want real psychological witness or testimony for motives without any class warfare bs on the side. And/or you ever wondered about the various ""mean girls"" bunches that exist nearly everywhere too. (No more so than in high school or college dorms.) Because this really takes a bite out of that nugget entity. Multi-sided look under a microscope too.Can you believe I gave 5 stars to a novel about rich, immature, and basically appalling for morals or kindness millionaires times 20 daughters? I can't believe it. Even with all the labels recognitions and other status dumb stuff, this one hit the target. Manipulation for their new powers- girls at 18!And the prettier or most verbal are also some of the worst. Drama= good. It isn't boring. But these 3 are closer to 14 years of age equivalent in my own epoch period. Or about 16 years equivalent in my kids' eras of the 1990's. Very different onus on responsibilities and initiatives plus the cultural crutches have made growing up twice as long as it used to take.

Several narrators- with parts entirely disconnected to each other until the murder is discovered. Two cops investigating, a couple at crux, some others entwined with the Dublin locale density apartments called ""The Crossings"". It kept my interest. I knew everyone was a liar from the get go. Putting Covid so entirely into the plot was well done. Dublin sounded way more forgiving than urban/suburban big city USA, IMHO. Mask wars being the least of it. I did not have any trouble picking this up between other reads. But it kept me interested enough to read it entirely within 3 busy days. At points, the repetition got me though. The SAME EXACT conversations are repeated through the other person's ""eyes"" so to speak. And much movement and apartment 1 description is also endlessly redundant.

The minutia to exact information to paths for the Cazalet clan members and their associative relatives/ friends continue. It is 5 star plus well done in the specific and super exact economics, mores, practicalities of that era in England.This is the very first book of this series (of the 4 I have read 1-4), IMHO, that DID depart a bit from reality base. She choose to tie up all the ends in perfect, nearly conclusive- little boxes of melding or end stage ""found"" selves or permanent associations. And for me, that was a cop out. I'm sure the great majority of readers over the decades loved that aspect. But life NEVER works out that way. Never for any group of this many individuals. There is always a number of any proportion that are seeking, troubled and ""between"" all the routes they end up traipsing. So we have our favorite cousins at the core again. And the 3 brothers all in England operations as well. Archie has become almost like a 4th father/ uncle. And the original wives too. All paths to conclusive destiny. She wrote the #5 15 years later than this at 89. What a tremendous energy/ person she must have been. It's the only book (All Change) I can't get from nearly any system- just in an ebook form available. But I'll get it eventually.Last thoughts: This entire series was one of the best I've come across to portray a time, place. Quite beyond the folks themselves. THE MEALS? How could they live past early adulthood on toast. Half the meals are not meals- but less than a snack. And the emotional state of most of the young women? So ignorant of any permanency for their decisions. And all the ""falling"" in and out of ""love"" when love has almost nothing to do with any of it at all. Nor even knowledge of the base person. But I guess, that was pretty much the era too. And not being able to do or have any logistics knowledge of rote tasks too, on top of it. Villy and just one or two others during this entire decade eventually learn to cook. I didn't like a few of her rounding outs at all. Especially with Villy. But Howard was of her own era, as well. Long married and original wives that were divorced- was ""the end"", I guess. This final book almost made me give it a 3 star rating. I liked all the earlier first 3 better. It's because I got so sick of Clary's extremes and hyper emotions. Copy lengths for her in this book? She was really just as selfish as Louise, looking at the whole. Only in a more high drama style. Polly, Zoe, Duchy, Christopher were my favorite parts. Always. I had to reread entire pages more than 50 times during this book's perusal. You don't know who is talking to whom or where or which group until 20 paragraphs into the section. Many readers will not have the patience to decipher E. J. Howard's copy by this stage of the game. Several times too, the characters were ones you had not seen or heard from in the last 150 pages. Keeps you on your toes, alright. Straight into dialogue and all pronouns!I found there is a DVD Cazalet film. It's on the way to me.

But it IS always chronological.Clary and Polly are supreme in this one. When Louise saw her father from her box at the theater, I did remember that I had read this one before. When they were new. But I never got to #3. These are not books that you can fly through, in any sense or time appropriation. Depth is mighty beyond the details of commonplace days. And those with short attention spans will not succeed. Learn REALITY of what goods, foodstuffs, heating options etc. were in this time and place. Quite beyond the Blitz nightclub few pages experience. It's eye opening. And all these people! IMHO, I think it was only Louise who thought about nothing but herself. Almost all (great majority of children or teens too) thoughts and emotions were spent outward. While picking up practical pieces to dress, eat, aid, stay well enough to ""help"" and beat the mighty evil. Or just to find the best personal role for the future.

I truly wonder how many young readers will understand it. The pacifist, who cannot cipher any avenue to remain as such. Not in remaining sane at the same time. So much of secretive necessities to thoughts of worry or travesties. I understand that completely. Doubt, and I could be wrong, many youth or even middle aged of 2023 will get that at all. But the ""boring stuff"" (other s) is mighty to digest here. Whose ""truth"" works? Who is a mighty saint, while never being wholly cognizant of that themselves. I think Villy was. In the massive tasks put on her plate to keep the Cazalet refuge open and functioning alone. Duchy at her age, nearly the same. What do you think about to keep yourself going? Elizabeth Jane Howard will tell you. People don't just develop self-identity and purposes like this out of minutia of tradition or habits. The prose in this book can become sublime at points. Like when she is Neville's eyes. Or Rolly's (toddler) physical movements/ attributes. And/ or Clary or Polly's philosophical pining paragraphs and beauty routines or parsing to the situation disagreements.

Two of his lieutenants are gone on task elsewhere but Ma has eyes on the situation. Truly enjoying!Lieutenant Ma is the central action and character in this one that occurs 6 months after Maze and as such is right at the beginning of Judge Dee's long career. It is exceptional on at least 3 different counts. For one, you get an intense and deep understanding of the personalities beyond the cases being explored here. Ma most especially, but also Judge Dee at home and his 3 wives. They each also have their own expertise and roles in how the family thrives. They appear in some actions and even within the graphic drawings that I just love. And these women even have clothes on. Third Wife plays an active role and it is a celebration for 1st wife's birthday. You know their ages. The clothing stages of decoration etc. and styles (shapes) are base forms for the mores and function of work purposes. This entire dressing depth is also explored. The style that is current is almost like a Japanese kimono with wide robes, pants, sleeves. Everyone uses sleeves for carrying, much more than even pockets. But way beyond that, the different clothing is essential to authority recognitions and much else of identity. You see this with Ma as much as with the Judge. Changing the color or fabric or even kind of cap will make him recognized as varied in purpose and even within name or onus of the moment who his identity becomes or how people react to him.Also we learn more about the town itself beyond the excellent mapping provided. And how the tribunal in standard process works every workday morning. Also the border considerations with the Northwest slums / row and streets. Please note if you take these on that they were written in mid-century 1900's. Barbarians are called barbarians. Women without training or of lower classes pick their noses or sound beyond even replying to them uncouth. This is a reality latter 600's AD. Reading some s? You also get a conclusion to the love affair Ma had in book #1. He bought her out and also purchased a soup kitchen for her work. And married her off to a solid husband. And the next women in his life are completely on the scene as well. Ma is always a player, where ever he ends up. Here in the Phantom of the Temple- there is a Abbess and a seer/ witch. And also a testy, filled with spark aide to the Abbess with which he pairs for work and sleuthing purposes. They need to find a more than 1 year old hidden location. Dangerous too. Young Fang is getting larger roles (hired in Maze as a new young constable) and he is wounded during the worst of these. Lots of past theft and other deplorable duplicitous crimes uncovered in these 3 cases of crimes within a mish/mash. Judge Dee deciphers expertly. Unknowingly testing the reactions of ""jump back"". And you get to meet the entire Dee family pictured in lovely art on top of it.4.5 stars. But I can't round it up because it was, if anything, too short. I wanted to hear the children's names too.

The text was 4.5 stars (including introduction /prologue and explanations of the Chinese to English writing process he used). This was written in 1956. The graphic portraits were 5 stars. Every other chapter or so- you get a Chinese portrayal witness detailing a scene. Incredible. It's Tang Dynasty occurring (as Judge Dee lived between A.D. 630-700) but written in the style of the Ming Dynasty (A.D. 1368-1644). Fabulous research to do this.As in life there are always several tribunal cases going on at once. It departs greatly from western style who-dun-its by that fact only. And often the detective is police job based working on ONE or at the most two related cases in most Western mystery writing. Not in Chinese juris prudence, nor within hierarchy, highly structured onus of jobs etc. Everyone who is found guilty, confesses. Read about procedures, and you'll understand why. In China during these periods, the magistrate of the tribunal was judge, detective, and operator of the forms of punishment or retribution.Excellent reads. This one was tops of all I've read before. Very introductory to his two lieutenants, as well. How they became a working unit. A handful of others, also, who return or remain in Judge Dee's district of Lan-fang. (On the border of the far NW with Uighur tribes ready to bounce right in at any weaknesses.) The sensibilities are as far from the present times for judgment/decision making or cognitions as they might possibly be, IMHO. Most especially when it comes to gender, race, tribe, class or especially AGE. The language is clear and yet filled with art forms. Art in poetry, verse, prose quotes, and drawings. Manners in formal or personal exchange and dressed forms are pivotal. Power by intrigue is 6 stars core. Violence contained/ suppressed/ always possible and yet never consciously avoided or delayed when at a point of crux.These are hard to get. I'll try to get all in English where they still live. Most I come across were first published in the Hague as he was a Dutch diplomat. Robert van Gulik explains what, why, and how in numerous paths of crossing the language divides- he has used certain forms when he has. And how the intrinsic models of authority, government, house etc. completely differ or align. Not only now but in those times to other parts of the world. Be warned, it has entirely varying assumptions throughout. And gender, class, job, address manner could not be more different than Western world 2000 plus. And yet at the same time, the punishment quotient is fairly equal to either medieval or Renaissance Europe. It's bad.All three or four plot lines were ingenious. Some like the locked room one, not exactly the same- but close to a solution I have read before. I believe this author often had plots and ploys snatched over the last century.These are entertaining, and this one in particular will teach you the many millennia system of Chinese exam taking authority entry and position advance.

Ones in which more than 15 show up for every Thanksgiving or Christmas Eve etc. And for which 22 individuals coming over for a holiday or baptism or communion or special birthday, is not uncommon.

Not only within the dialogue of address, swear, repeat place of origin, swear- but in the huge predominance of violence. Sometimes maniacal. Also, and beyond just the terrible tone- I have had many readings upon the 100 years' war between England and France, but this particular one was the most difficult for me to hold with any deep connection. Because this seems to make it all about occupied territory. And yet the economics? So many throw away men willing to be mercenaries? Which at the same time as characters seemed to grasp no depth. With all the bodies, many of them corpses, I still could not embed to these people in the sense of REAL.

The first is before WWI- in the late 1880's and 1890's- quite before. The second is early WWII (I note that some posters have this wrong.) Pigeon Pie was published in 1940. Yes, they made jokes about Hitler. And the sensibility is far, far from 2010 plus. What I like so much about both is the wit and Nancy Mitford core writing of real people in mundane and ordinary actions/ lives. Her period pieces are genuine. They are an entire world of habits.

He is probably not even 95% honest, but he can't be. He is as honest as he CAN be. His life is so outlier that it is truly stating only 1/100th of the iceberg that is Tony Tetro and his art skills career- to cover the immense detail involvement in not only his path but all the processes. He is 1st generation as I am and from people in the very same origins' area. But easier climates both sides of the ocean, IMHO. He started in life work selling furniture and doing any job he could find quite young. Same here. But Tony could draw. And he could paint. And also had an engineer's eye for detail and for power/movement. Be it the power of light and dark or the power within a Lamborghini original. And there is nothing he likes better than both of those obsessions rather than to figure out and practice and produce ""how it was done"". And to see if he could do it. Equal. Or better.I learned more about etching and lithographs than in any other book I've read. And also why some of the Old Masters were never given the proper respect they should have. Way back in the 1950's and 1960's I always thought that Caravaggio was immensely underrated. And of course Rembrandt.If you read one memoir this year- read this one. Learn something. This is exactly why old art books have to be locked down and not open to the public in most libraries. If you want some real eyes into the modern day Art World of sales and auction etc. OMG- you need to read this. At least one third of all the works in museums and everywhere has been successfully provenance provided and fully or partially faked. With all the cellular level analysis that they have to offer now, this is nearly impossible compared to 30 or 40 years ago. But not entirely. This read is not for everyone. You need to have immense patience for process and learning detail upon detail upon detail. I thought some of his solutions were on a par with nuclear fusion research. And his core ""love life""? What do you think Laura was going to propose? I guessed it.And what an ultimately strange personality and value system Tony has. You truly know what ""his fun"" includes. Solving a riddle of possibility quite beyond just owning the Italian race cars. And being sent back down to base 1 and zero stage homelessness? Hardly. That made me laugh. His associations alone are better than the Pope's or the President's. Any president.After you finish this- think about the values on the whole. Just think for at least 15 minutes of pure meditation. What difference does it make? Some of his Picasso, Miro, and especially Dali are BETTER than the ones who held pure authenticity. Not only my opinion.His condo sounded out of this world.

Some of his politics brought worse after worse. Still does. But most was understandable for the placements he held. Good intent may often be counter productive.After some time in contemplation and in sickness (yep took me out for 3 or 4 days.):This is a good book to read if following the insider contacts and compromises for the inner circles of Democratic Party politics in Chicago during the last century. He is 5 years older than I and in his 80's now. But has been active more than not that entire time of our lifespans. From a mixed job youth of teaching and police work. He didn't even finish proper high school. I remember Joyce as always being in the background. As a state Senator from 19th district. I was always 18th ward, right next door. He was one district east of me in Sabina's parish. But we have nearly identical childhood/ young person placements and some other intersects to absolutely knowing what Chicago was like in those mid-century days especially. Up until the Days of Rage. Joyce did not have to go through SDS and worse every day at school and transit. I did. He was a policeman then and had somewhat infiltration backup/ protection. Also during all the varying riots, his horrors were MUCH less than mine. That's the truth.He is 100% politician and his compromises were at time, to me, not cited here in the real flavor of what they condoned. Joyce is extremely good at sympathetic double talk. Still. I quite enjoyed hearing about Harold and Jane Byrne's days and the inner circle cabals. How Dick Mel and Ed Vrdolyak operated etc. Also Rostenkowski's pit downfall with money etc. But he didn't reveal anything new to me. Said much of the good without telling the truth for avenues of ""special people"" at all. You may like to read this for nostalgia if you are a South side Chicagoan. People suffered but they did also at points enjoy. To this day I know at least 50 to 100 people who will not speak of the times when they lost their houses, churches, neighborhoods all in one clean sweep within 10 years. My Mother gave away a three flat on Racine where I was born. It was burned within the decade regardless. It was NOT shoddy construction at all- the marble outside was literally vandalized and stripped away in mere years. The front door was burned in entry attempts three times in 2 years right after we left. The man she gave it too tried very hard but was nothing but 100% property loser in the end regardless. His race didn't protect him either.Many lens told here are more than slanted. Today he is probably a Republican. He was right of JFK during JFK's time, I do remember. JFK would be a Republican today. Jeremiah Joyce could talk. Still loves it. You can tell.He wouldn't have made the cut for a McAuley girl- that's for sure.

Henry/Lily are put solidly upon a two sided scale now. One that very few of us would ever begin to contemplate for use. The dynamic is similar to the series Killing Eve- if some of you have the onus to know how the two prime women in that series feel about murder. He crosses some bridges here that I doubt half of his readers may be wary to traipse on repeats. We shall see. But I thought the prose form and the plot progress were both excellent in this book. Swanson DOES have the talent to write precise nuance. You KNOW Joan. You KNOW Richard. Both in youth and just as they are now. Henry is no straight arrow for morality either.

That the crux was a conviction and posited upon an overall crime that was, for me, hard to swallow on top of it. So many features, too many to list.

DNA, fingerprints, foot prints etc. (I still have the footprints from all my children at birth and they were born more than 50 or 40 years ago.)So this is just not a Coben favorite. The ending also felt so rushed, while the first parts were exceedingly long without real purpose, IMHO. All that stuff with Ted (Curly) for instance. Even though it flowed along, the balance was not as even as his early stuff or even some of the books of 10 years ago.

Jessica is accurate at her estimation of the family being champion haters which concludes this book. All, except Tom. Yup!Oh, this is NO Pursuit of Love.

Because it is GOOD and because it is one of the best family dynamics/ sculpted to era and personality vibes examples still out there. Any class, any gender- regardless- pure REAL 1930's- 1940's England. Oh, the English prose skills of the early 20th century! When beautiful prose was ""run of the mill"" cliched to hold vocabulary and flow that strongly approached beauty AND knowledge for words in their particular parts of speech. Each to its proper place. And the carved ""being"" and ""eyes""- from 9 or 10 ""sides"" here. Lots of names, but you do NOT confuse them. These are all specific and particular INDIVIDUALS beyond their pattern of connections. Despite some being classified ""hon"" or ""non-hon"" within the hidden ""hon closet"". Radlett family! Will I ever forget Uncle Matthew and Aunt Sadie? Nope. I read this the first time probably 4 plus decades ago and still remember the trenching tool on display and the foundation of their directions to their girls. Mitford was a gem. Her people were 1920's originals from youths of war, to ""bolters"" who ran their lives with their hearts and with almost nothing coming from their heads, to the ones who threw it all off and went to other continents on a lifelong whim. Not all of the primes- but in this one- more than a couple. Women who were provided FOR and had men who also could do nothing with them to the 110% degrees. While doing it rigorously (all) without the word work being within their cognition or even within the shared vocabulary. But it isn't just themselves. Or the ""hon"" class either. EVER.People in 2023 might scorn or read with dubious sneers. Yet do understand that for many millennia recorded, the biggest changes in mores in human industrialized civilizations DID occur in the 1920's - 1930's. Some of those also happened without continual fear, disillusionment, angry retribution, or even in a ""poor me"" bad mood spirit of behaviors or declaring of victimhood. Incredible. They label this sarcasm/ satire? It's fun, flippant and actual. Exaggerated yes, but so very real. I do remember just a decade later than the period of the blitz when joy was not a dirty word. And the tone, demeanor of the general WWII crew too. Ready for a instant party. Not only aristocracy in any measure. If you want to read WWII- please do read the stuff from the actuals. And in their periods of memory and of the time when one would instinctively run more TOWARD the danger than ever conceive of running away from it. Caution, self-isolating, insular? Ha!

The form was ok but not as perfect as the Hampton Court's family #1. I thought the last 60 pages of the book dropped to more trivia than the storyline could support. Not that this group of social society isn't minutia structured to detail from the get-go. This one also at points jumped the fence to farce. But not in a bad way either. The characters are extremely drawn within daily, lengthy and exact descriptions. So all the peculiarities are center stage core. It's enjoyable to read and as much celebration as it is cutting. Rather like the ""Odd couple"" dynamic. But this one isn't just about order or neatness.People with family history entry (hon's) and their 1930's society and lives within countryside England are put into almost judicial exposure through Franny's eyes. Uncle Matthew, Aunts Sadie and Emily and especially Davey are all strong actors again. This book should be read only after #1 so the stage is truly set for Polly's or Franny's stories in this #2. All will be revealed.There are no cliff hangers between the trio of Radletts' books, but development and deep progression result. So I do not recommend reading them out of order.I had never read this #2 and was shocked at Polly's choice. The rest of the outcomes did not surprise me at all. Especially for our dominant societal queen Sonia.There will be excess style, clothing, art and object criteria pages in this one for some people. No one mentions the townie horse lady at Oxford- another don's wife who attempts befriending Franny. Excellent under character development in a succinct and exact prose bullseye there. Mitford was superb at that kind of shot. She would have been a great comedic tv show editor or sit. com. writer. Even outside of her own social ""hon"" class. Absolutely.

(All gathered in one place while the sleuth defines the perp, crime and process.) And Horowitz notes that it does too. This one is neither too long (a couple were) nor as complicated as his book in a book former Hawthorne formats. This one is a play in a book. The play is his own (Horowitz writer) Mindgame. Reading it was delightful. Like London neighborhood candy with a side of popcorn for viewing live drama experience. NOT a musical, but beyond neighborhood theater group territory. More experimental than that and far more savvy. It IS Horowitz.I did not guess the perp. Although I did perceive other connections and motives in the reveal very early on. I actually wanted to give this 5 stars just for his dishing of current subjects by the primes in this one. Some are Horowitz himself, but not all. Like the belief that cultural appropriation makes it impossible for authors to write about anything but their own narrow specific identity category in any depth. Kudos, kudos Anthony. What judgment and superficial nonsense that is carried within groupthink during this decade is beyond imbecility.He also includes many theater and film references of the past. Far past and more recent as well. And trend of ""label"" and other values that may be less crossed in the last 10 years. This novel is all happening in 2018 while he is writing Moonflower, by the way. The entire book happens within just a few weeks of real time. Mostly in the rain. There WAS an essential detail I couldn't swallow. The fact that Horowitz couldn't recall within one day if he had carried that first night present package home with him on his walk back to his flat. In the rain and that late at night? You WOULD remember everything you had to hold. It's possible even a dementia individual would. Horowitz is early 50's. Come on! But it's fiction. I was just surprised that smarty pants left such an obvious void as acceptable questioning territory. I know he loses his phone, or his ticket etc. often. But you remember having to carry something when it is that bulky. Not pocket stuffer or coat breast material size at all.#4 is fun. It includes some small trips to the country and other offices. This one has TONS of London background building and neighborhood description. Makes you want to take a trip!Anyway, read it. Easier and more fun than the others. And of course, it also is a milestone. Because we finally find out more about Hawthorne and his background. Hawthorne still never eats and smokes continually. The two ridiculous police officers of the other books are prime in this one too. And just as obnoxious. Horowitz knows the law but in his book he acts and proceeds in copy like some of them don't exist, IMHO. But he makes every book hold a couple of outside the box characters beyond just the two inspectors and being truly procedural would ruin the fun. This one had at least 4 more of these and also his dog Lucky is a moving part.This one is not hard work to read like the others. I read it all within 1 day in just a couple of hours.

Here is a good writer coming up to his better marks in #3. And within this one Joe himself is nearly ""out""- away on an assignment. And he needed to be. Lila was starving for development from the whining victim mess up of 3/4ths of her copy up until now. In the last book she was also ""turned over a new leaf"" saintly. And few things are more insufferable than a formerly hedonist self dramatic addicted neurotic who becomes the preach and teach straight laced role model. Yes, it's more than the smug and suffering quotients too. Lila had to step up and out. And in this one she finally did. By facing her insecurity and past guilts, but far more than that, by structuring her own core strength. Always ""there"" but formerly buried in self-pity and accepted mood of powerlessness. And I was super glad she did it ALONE without her Joe emotional crutches. Kudos, Eskens.Allen Eskens did a great job with Lila. Despite the rock climbing episode to get her there. Anything that works. But I did think that rather simplistic and over the top for Andi to contrive. It could have gone far wrong. And honestly, that is the only way to face down a Dovey. And you absolutely do need the ""right"" audience.But this is a duo narrator roller coaster beyond the Lila core. Gavin became carved as well. And you never lost the Minneapolis stream/ vibe. Not once. Summer on walkways high or river viewed are special. He didn't even leave out the bike rental stands. Are they still there? Chicago's lasted weeks before most were scavenged or stolen. Mostly scavenged.Good job. 4.5 stars and the ending was a double punch. Although I can very much ""get"" it could be possible. Some of these in this genre are just not believable at all for any forms of urban or country reality. And so satisfying to me was the ""just desserts"" - so appropriate. So many rules that the worst of the worst get out to do it again and again and again. Not just killing, but maiming and lifelong disability. Not for themselves by upon others.It was a bit too long with all the Lila past ""replays"" and cutting repeats etc.- and with all her same/same Mom interludes. Even the last one. That was a bit round the bend for a Mom who wrote that category of letter to Lila's therapist. The one aspect I did not find believable in this novel. But there are lots of readers out there who will eat up that portion. Other posters state they found this slow? I didn't. I always felt tension and progress to a speed pace, even during the first half.The short sequence within the prison dynamic was also good. True. For me his work has always been 3 stars and decent.

Shifty's Boys might be in the running for most overrated book of 2022, IMHO.Don't misunderstand. The premise, plot, characters are nearly excellent- above average well done in detail and some of their quotes are too. BUT, this one held a thought pattern and a mood onus type of ""directive"" in Mick's judgment, personality, motives- that for me just did not fit. It did in Killing Hills. His prose flow in narration to mindset, thoughts etc. held preach/teach, and more than just a handful of strong social justice warrior type crux posits. Never, ever meet a person of his place, history in the Army, or any associated type of work within death scenes major that held such. It grated in me from just after the beginning 80 pages. Which until then was a full 4 stars. Loved the character of Shifty and as another er noted I thought of the same actress in Justified too.But it just doesn't work to have coastal elite prime ""should this and should that"" within the cultural mores of Kentucky. Not a fan. Panders to the readers and the author to himself (putting major cultural road blocks in the way of his writing) and doesn't meld. It's phony. And neither the electioneering Sheriff nor her brother would ply them. He also uses some Army language and technical aspects incorrectly and doesn't know what he doesn't know about that area of expertise, as well. He doesn't do research on this? Fiction IS fiction, but come on. USA Afghanistan loss of a more than another country's entire GDP in equipment, transport, arms, tech- just occurred. You need to be far more exact to name what you name accurately for a vet just after and during recovery for IED experience. How do you think HE feels about that? Talk to any. You'll find out.I was super disappointed that the author took that easy pleasy route and skirted reality there for Mick's history of knowledge and the language used in several different references. Mistake as bad as having the Pope overlook Good Friday and going to a brisket smoke bbq instead. Ok and fast read. Some fun and some thinking. But not anywhere in the territory of Killing Hills.

Reaction is mixed because the last 50 pages, IMHO, almost sunk the entire. Way too much, telling telling, telling. Explaining, explaining, explaining all the magic tricks and minutia of illusions. And that made the entire way, way too long. I did return to this novel after lengths of pausing for long intervals. There were reasons encased within the writing style itself and the wordy, wordy effusions etc. Too many reasons actually to list here and none of them are an overloading bother to most others so I will refrain. But this WAS a book that could have used an immense edit. And had the tension brought out, not drowned by the carved A personality level characters. Many of them.He has very excellent time/era feel (first half especially), plot, and subterfuge. But he lacks writing sharpness entirely. All the feelings, fears, dreads get buried in the ""other stuff"". Like directions, descriptions, tangents that are entire plots by themselves etc. And he especially does NOT do endings well. As much as I enjoyed the tale, I almost gave it 2.5 or 3 stars by the time it was finished. Because the ""big scenes"" of action were absolutely shipwrecked by the minutia of 100 trivia conversations. YOU KNEW their personalities enough. Plus he became entirely out of the time period itself in those conversations in the last half of the book. A book by itself, actually from the time of the last 3 tragedy events of Old Tom. Well I sure did like it far more than his other (7 Deaths etc. one) novel. But I will be dubious to take another of his on without a huge hole to put all that reading time in.

It holds 3 of the most developed personality and carved characters that I've read in eons. Miss Jane, her father, and her doctor. And it is cored on the personal. As it occurred throughout great spans of history and until not that long ago. When dire or hard or hardest travail or life journey or condition or real placement was lived within the individual primarily. And not group shared so that every ill and/or condition became blame or voice toward advertised resounding negativity or retributions. Constantly and consistently visible too when it does absolutely no good, essentially the opposite. And Miss Jane also contains huge wisdom and grace within the personal cognition (self identity core itself) of being less or different or excluded or whatever else can happen. Because it surely does happen in human reality.The first half was good, but the second half was superb. I still can't believe it was written in this century. When everything that can be construed as bad has continual reaction of anger, blame and advertisement of the fact. Because I can remember decades that were quite like Jane's place and time for exactly the opposite. Excellent role models of how to accept adversity that can't be changed or limits beyond control of them.This so reminded me too of my friends who had polio when we were young and either never got old or lived for some years with constant handicap. One especially who I think of at least once a week and who lived until her 50's with immense grace. And those that ever after our peer play had their lives changed by violence at home or at war elsewhere. Most before we were grown. Some of us have huge handicaps (all types, some are not only physical) which others never see and have no conception at all to the recompense for them.

Review tomorrow.Later: This is procedural (heavy in various dictates/ associations too) but at the same time it is odd. Odd in a good way. Different. There are metaphysical implications. And the plot lines twist back upon each other. What happened 12 years ago in Estonia. Estonia today. The fallouts in Scotland from both periods. And the suppositions also include other ""people met along the way"" because of Westphall's plane phobia. And these became entwined. It was deeper in psychological aspects and in philosophical tend within the prose flow to be IN this procedural who-dun-it type of case/thriller. It was too long. Mainly because of all the drives and minutia of travel during stops between trains, ferries, rental cars etc. And IMHO, and probably only my own and not a majority opinion- I think the thought patterns for the plane fears and anxiety passages over future orders for time limits to get to the headquarters etc.- that became redundant/ repetitious. But Westphall's thoughts are of such depth to knowledge and experience that they were not impossible to swallow either. Not at all.PLUS- that is accurate for how phobia is and plays out. Not only flying in airplanes but within 90% of all phobias. Immense thought and anticipation fear proceeds for days or weeks. It's a hard read. It took twice as long to absorb as most books of this genre or series type. And if you don't have psych or even biologic background knowledge? This doesn't suffer fools in any sphere. Do you believe in a person splitting in two physically OR psychologically? Or is time travel mental side (not within physical body placements) actual/ possible and real? Lots of those types of conundrums here. As are many quotes put into forms that are true mind meals to digest. Some dozens I had to read twice or three times. And I won't add any here. Read them with patience. An exceptional writer will supply these to the reader on occasion. Lindsay does it nearly continually. It makes the copy exceptional in an exactness to mood/ nuance sense beyond just the intellectual high level. Coupled they are much above average. And I'm sure I'll read more of this series.But I will give myself time to fit these hard reads in also. They are not the type of book you can pick up and get right back in either. Too complicated to memory and to suggestions to do that easily or at all.Warning to those who dislike brutal in any form. Some of the information is beyond real for selling organs from kidnapped and imprisoned. And there is next to no morality within sexual, violence fallouts, or highly damaging habits of behavior to others in more than just the perp group. I did like the way it ended. Justice? Hardly but better than prison.I recommend this one if you are in the mood for a think piece.

Non-fiction or fiction, jumpiness and then re-telling what you told. It's a poor pace and a poor copy for anything that has tension of crime or long term relationships. Those especially. So because of that obvious and repeating terrible habit in the first 40 to 50 pages, I very nearly made this a DNF. But after reading other fare, all non-fiction per chance, I did come back to this one. Twice.And then some of the connections to tangents became more obvious. And there WAS more repeating what was already told (out of time sequences also, and more than just a couple of times) but at least you got a better, deeper grasp of crux personality onus, aims, desperations etc. For instance you know about the two boys and then all of a sudden 50 pages later she is pregnant with the second boy. Not in flashback either. It's as if the entire base copy was never edited for continuity or repeat exact sentencing.Still! Maybe it is because I lived through this period which is history to most readers for this fare today to be so slogged with at least half of this repeated information? Nevertheless, I doubted before I read this that either character was worth this length, and I am remaining to the same direction / opinion in telling others about attempting this read; studying these two characters is like doing sonar in a puddle. So much other good non-fiction of intrepid folk is out there. This is the shallow, mean, and self contained for any approach to ""happy"". Suicide potential from nearly their birth days. So not all that much fun to read. Liking a person's style in clothing or appearance, or their writing product ability or any type of art or display exposures and acts of societal interchange- that is not the same as liking the person themselves. Or admiring any of their core qualities either. This seems to equate the two as if they were nearly equal.Read this only if you have interest in the celebrity or social high class worlds of NYC during the 1950's-1960's.

And for me they seemed real in their youths (baseball, sports, boxing etc.) but didn't work for me after adulthood.I know I am outlier about Grisham fiction. But I prefer a much more in head character development than a telling of their biography or job skills or actions more personal in nature etc. And that only occurs with Keith rarely here. Because I have visited Biloxi several times during the first decade of this century and 1 time for length at Gulf Shores in Alabama, not that far away. And because I did visit before and just after Katrina in that entire area- I knew much of the demographics and some of the places / structures. And know that his tale is not far from reality. Mary Mahoney's is the oldest restaurant in the USA proper. It was there before the Louisiana Purchase. He doesn't tell you of Beauvoir or any other places of greatest tourist or beach scenes. Beautiful beach.Hugh seemed so dark that the last 1/2 of the book became more like reading a court or grift, criminal cabal case. In an age where horrific was terrible but not on the scales it is now. Not with corrupt authority or with various treatments of reaction for the more special among us. Chicago has been worse for most of my lifetime. But I thought the periods of 1960's, 1970's was especially accurate for here and path progressions. Both.In Grisham writing I can never approach a 4 star rating. I've tried over many years and have omitted his works for eons. It is because you have very dry telling and hardly any knowing. For instance, in this book, you never once got to know Keith's wife. Actually none of the women were developed. They become a one or two syndrome name. Either angels or nasty crazies for the most part. But you never see ""them"" really, at all. Worse than Dickens- saints with halos or demons with purpose? I know others do not feel that way. But for me, that is fiction written for ""knowing"" at a grade school level. You may know the important soul aim or ambition or reaction but you NEVER know the person. All the law, court, punishment chapter lengths make it even more distant from any personality.Well, I have visited Biloxi and hope that the next hurricane doesn't wipe all the structures out again.

And despite months, years, decade more intimacies and friendships- little to almost nothing of a reveal about his own ""identity"" or onus or depth in background or family. Even to his most intimate youth to graduate student best friend. Johnny Jebsen who introduced him into the German intelligence portions of his long, long associations. Both in his life's ""work"" and in social spheres.The book is not as easy to read or to comprehend in continuity as his Odette and Alise spy biographies which were 4 or 5 star level. Those spy experts had a short run and it was a much later period of involvement and on a far smaller scale of intersects. But Popov! His started way before the war and some of the most intriguing microdot method reveals were prior to American entry into the war. Hoover knew about Pearl Harbor as a target. For sure. The documentation and massive lengths of pages of the documents themselves (at the end those and the sources are almost a third of the book length)! My Dad always said that Roosevelt knew too. Until his dying day he made it a habit to tell again and again. Most especially before each election day. And of his witness of information about Patton's assassination. He was in Trieste (1945-1947) after the European theater folded and headed a district for repatriating German or Axis soldiers back to their respective country entities or not (it depended on dozens of factors) from Italian prisoner of war camps. He said he saw proofs too in papers about speculation for the possible dates in these same circles of older documentations. Roosevelt and Hoover both had their reasons and the Depression was NOT getting better in USA, but worse in 1940 and 1941. Plus, the Allies side multitudes were imploring for the USA to get into the war. Quickly.This man Dusko Popov (Serbian core elite family, most of which were doctors or surgeons like his Father) was so multi sided that it is hard to keep all the code names and surnames straight. Yet to even get into all the vast distance interplays between them all. And try to understand where and how Dusko's family in Belgrade and Dubrovnik were fating at the same time and/or how he was trying to trade people out. (All moving pieces, endlessly- most especially with his brother Ivo.) (Ivo was either in the forest as an insurrectionist or in prisons. Ivo's wife and baby were scheduled to be shot or hung- three different times unless he gave up positions/ information.) There are 10 levels of intermix that you can't keep straight while reading. And Dusko is on 3 continents at various periods of 3 months to 4 months each for nearly 20 years. So how did he ply his conversations to all and in each of 20 different places? With at least a dozen to two dozen women girlfriends at the same time? Some of the same ones, in rotations. He loved it. The only time he was slow to leave was the year plus in the USA when he had the Hollywood actress Simon. But even in those months he was within at least 5 different cities by his own rotations within the USA alone. NYC, Hollywood were always two of them. In Europe he was anywhere from England to Egypt. Each place more than twice. Some within a 6 week period- 5 or 6 places. And the money to do this? That is a book alone. More than novel length to understand the money transfers and schemes. That was half of all spies subterfuge, IMHO- in man or woman hours. Does that give you pause to think about the downsides of digital currency and present tech? Or how authority can just ""shut it off""- like they can fuel. But the best thing about this book and also the two others of his (Loftis) I have read are the Lisbon chapters (not all together whatsoever). (This is the place that is featured in the 007 movie Casino Royale). I can't imagine all those juxtapositions of intelligence and spycrafts or enemies from manufacture, to trade, to dangerous slip of the tongue, all in one place. On the ocean and within those sets of hotels and resorts. Paris and Rome, too. But always that Estoril, Portugal complex itself! The book is worth reading for those 1000's of particulars of Estoril and Lisbon in ""neutrality"" alone. All in one place. And the associations and visas exchanges to get there too. You get a tiny bit of Dusko's ending days after about 1960, but the majority of the copy is 1930-1950. The man lead at least 5 lifetimes in that one period alone. But you will need a brain like his to get through all the nuances and code names and codes to languages in this one. Quite beyond the personalities. I could have used more photos. Especially of Johnny and Dusko's brothers. Most of Johnny's course is still a mystery. Dusko, our James Bond, ended being naturalized as an English citizen. As did most of his birth family. More accurately, he was 003....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Nov 03, 2022","Nov 06, 2022","Oct 26, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/27209411-into-the-lion-s-mouth

Not only the mores, but the practices (common) for revenge, they belong more in the late Middle Ages, then they do now. This is not only killing for payback or dominance, but tortures of the worse types and suffering intensified on purpose.For the women, and by the women. Just as well and double the volume. Down to killing the two year olds volume. Not always quickly.I don't recommend this book unless you have a high threshold for reality of some of the very darkest capabilities of humans. I'm serious. I knew it was bad, and that Naples is the USA Armed Forces Hazard Pay station for a reason. Thank God my grandparents left Italy when they were teenagers and never returned. This is endlessly embedded within every striation of the population and economy. Not only Sicily. Worse in Naples and Calabria as they are not consolidated into one head but are divided by clans. Women's ""flying under the radar"" or not? Their onus and outcomes are with higher levels of connection to the intiated, much the same. And cruelty even worse.The form is hard to read as most non-fiction becomes. Because Pupetta Maresca's long life story is told throughout others over the decades embedded within the other women of her era's competitions. Decades. And every day a certain death if loyalty to omerta and the sources are betrayed.The journalist Nadeau is intrepid. And when 20 to 30 years younger was quite beyond naive to traipse into those elevators, towers, warren paths of alleyways. The Le Vele stories today and most recent for the women from Nigeria? Well, I had to actually skip parts as the trafficking and treatments were so bad.As I said, do not read this just on a whim. It's heavier than North Korean or other genocide torture practices. And executions. Because it lives behind a more ""normal"" serene face.The opinion of woman on the whole! Even to picking their own spouse or path. Or having capability for authority or direction? It's not only in the Mafia/Camorra/'Ndrangherta at all. It is embedded within the entire culture and cognition.But Covid shut downs have made every branch bigger/ dominant stronger and more controlling of the economy than ever before. And male nuance for women's onus is little different. So if you want a REAL slice of how it works, read this entire. Now the small business is existing hugely upon Mafia loan and sufferance.The author lives in Rome and often is in France. But has lived a long walk with this for decades and knows Italy. Not every dialect, but close. I loved the quote from Pope Francis about women which personifies this cognition. Another cultural set of mores which holds concept of female gender as somewhere on a lower scale and other type of Earth than men's. The named and described organizations are more powerful and with stronger eventual outcome than the government of Italy OR the Church. The government may actually run third.It IS very much like the Middle Ages in other aspects as well. Often brothers, sons, daughters, uncles are destroyed for similar reasons than the ""line to the throne"" power grabs between nobles during the Renaissance. Pupetta's eldest son was killed by the father of her second born twins, for instance. Terrible, terrible lives.

And the title is EXTREMELY core. Much a tell. And I didn't see application at all until the last 20 pages. Maybe because there are so many other words. It does border on wordy.Ricciardi's personality and gift/curse of his victims' visions and last seconds? Well, it sure doesn't cast any spirit of joy upon the complex scenarios of any portion of his life. And the times are also skin and bones horrific for the majority (here starvation is as real as death and accompanied by the living horror of its desperation).The wonderful de Giovanni soliloquy come alone, as well. There is one to Sunday. One to summer plantings accompanied by drought and being served with their daily water. Several shorter to the modes of a selfish life lived with total disregard for the people under the same roof. And with 5 separate entities under that roof not having much, if anything, to do with each other.It's fate crying / moaning Italian vibe strength. It is also overlong. But the case was, IMHO, excellent. Not usual whatsoever. Complicated even upon murderer motive. And methods. And time order. Duplicitous in numbers beyond in deed. I believe there was a Columbo (TV series) with that motif once. Agatha had one. But it's rare. And rarer the outcome of solving it, as well.Well, the Ricciardi / Enrica plotting is being carried out way too long. Patience is one thing. But at 24 years of age and in this time and place? Not completely unbelievable. Yet it borders on delusional and mentally ""off"" for some of the focus for this duo. They lost me already. Such backward self-protection and emotional OR physical imagination without any two sided communication? Just not a fan of this means of courting whatsoever. The Duchess got what she deserved?

And also an excellent side inquiry re a 12 year old girl's essays. (Accusing of sex abuse?) And because I've read out of order, I know what progresses with the Bastards personal lives too. But, possibly I have more nuance overall. You probably can read out of order without much difficulty. It seems not all have been translated. This author does the ""repeat chorus"" in prose that some poets use well. He holds excellent locale detail nuance and also perceptions of moods. In this one, most especially at the end of a long day ""going home"". But in every book there is deep mired philosophy or core intent or some general state (like cold, or spring, or loneliness etc.)- some abstract that becomes a pivot for the primes or the suspects. It's skillful and he is way, way above average for a writer in this genre. Or any general fiction forms that are in any best seller realm. He especially seems to grab the emotional sides of ""fate"" well. Very Italian in every sense of expression for it, too. It's a specific Italian perception of irony that is not common. Other Italian authors reflect it too. But de Giovanni is expert.In this one the Bastards become fully formed under Palma with the hierarchy above being solidly set into their ""get your fingers out of our pie"" foundation for operation style. Now, they seem to be an entity glued to tasks and not reactive of consequences from above nearly as much. Very central to all the ploys and details of their work in Naples now. And with Romano and Aragona as a team- so much wider operational overlay. Even more so than the other 4 primes. You begin to understand how they (all of them) use the snotty Aragona snark and insult for twisting information out in reactions. Or his sympathy ploys too. Within the 12 year old's cast of characters scenario that was superb. It was best ""not a murder inquiry accomplished"" that I've read in decades. They didn't need social workers either. They just used Marco's mouth with a side of panache acting.Naples itself is cold here. And did I actually laugh out loud for their ""sufferings"". Or boiler or space heater woes. It seems in Naples a drop of 20 or 30 degrees is catastrophic. I live where it can drop in temperature easily at least 50 to 70 degrees F in one day.

But then, this IS #1 and holds a lot in introduction to a character that is truly ""odd"" and within a dire time, at that. 1930's in Southern Italy holds living experience daily for memory of starvation, disease, and ""missing"" (all those who left for another continent who never will return) quite beyond just the politico.He sees the dead and hears their last words/thoughts. A almost identical scenario that I just happened to watch seasons for a New Zealand cored ""One Lane Bridge"" drama. Not an uncommon coincidence though. So many books, film, tv and cable streaming seem to be following some of the same base tenets. Especially if they have a police core or any copper procedural process as their home. Psychic cops or lawyers have been around for eons actually. I think Tony HIllerman had more than a few. But Ricciardi is immersed in graphic visions. I will read more of these for the characters, but I really like the Bastards of Pizzofalcone bunch much better. More than a handful of reasons. Some of them on the prose flow/ literary with the big L side at that. This Commissario era is so filled with starving lost and displaced beyond just the occult angle aspects.

All 6 bastards of Pizzofalcone and their boss come into full flower of their essence here. Before you knew them for a couple of quirks, their nicknames (given by Aragona), their main personality related investigative techniques or descriptions. They were so overboard in most cases that they were nearly cartoonish. But NOW, you know each by the doing and what is core human. Not at all by the telling.

Not just in the italics portions of ""think piece"" either. Naples with its sinuous curves of hills and peak and sea and bay. Most dangerous, lustful, and crafty. It is. (At one time it was the only place not at actual war zone status where the American soldier stationed near the bay got hazard pay. It is the only place I've ever been where women, two times, stopped me and motioned I could NOT carry my purse like that.)Fully formed as a team too now. Palma listens and doesn't only give orders. But when he does, he does. And as they seek the answers to one crime, they are with the ""president"" and ""Serpico"" finding quite another set.I sure hope all these books become translated. I will read all that do. And will start the other series set in 1930's Italy soon. It's not every month you find a new writer with so much material this GOOD and also this deep.

Nevertheless, it is, for me, 2.5 stars at the most. And only given that last .5 star for the earlier coming of age sections in the first half for Ella and Caroline. It was a book that I needed to drag myself back to between other reads after about page 190. I felt rather disconnected from Ella's world in Boston (was actually more interested in Martin)and wanted a whole lot more of their travels (just pittances) beyond the girls' lives they raised. And as in the novel on the whole too- there was WAY too much telling and telling and only now/then a 2 or 3 pages showing. Even within her Liz friendship or her ""sister missing"" quotient. Repeats.And Caroline! What a piece of work. Mean spirited and spiteful from infancy to prove what to whom? Beats me the appeal of sorting that soul.Reasons? I felt like I was at a Smothers' brothers show ""Mommy or Daddy liked you more than me"" got endlessly redundant. But I was only embedded when she was interacting with Jack. Same speed- both of them. Somewhat of a contest. Other than he, it was just status quo for her to roll over and desecrate nearly everyone else. Characters like her, I just fail to enjoy any reading experiences. Not even within non-fiction either.Everyone else hails the writing ability. It's middling at best. I wanted to like the effusions he cores around place setting memories and locales especially. Some of them were ok. But nothing evoking states of being there. Most especially within the Eastern European locations. I've been. They were never over 2 stars.And what brings it down nearly another whole star- the author's slants for events. Which ones he picks and chooses and what his ""true"" becomes as real in regards to them or through the ""character think"" reactions. Especially upon economic reversal times. DID he make me LOL! I was around in the 1950's (not a baby either) and have clear memory until the present day. These people were younger but MAJOR wars of his (this author's) politico ""truth eyes"" aren't even mentioned. When in any USA reality they would have been pivotal for youth, even of these ""just after"" group's generation. And in the SOUTH yet. Distorted stereotypes reign instead. They did within the North or NW USA, as well.This did deserve a 2 star. Other reasons that nail it, most particularly the hand in hand ending. What a bunch of Hallmark saccharine coating. But worse was the stereotyping and conditions of such. It was God awful all the way down the line for generic. Elitist eyes acting like ""folks"" too repeatedly. That factor was always narrative present and without consistent imagination to make it dramatic. More melodrama fare.Not my kind of writing style at all. Not sharp. Not core cutting. Could have been a better book for sure, if it was edited by at least a quarter without the consistent nearly identical words for the feeling redundancies. Southern USA reading excellence? Oh no!

But being almost exactly of the age of new India- I remember many of these issues. Especially the slaughters, as in Kashmir. This is NOT light reading. This is how the trick of the title was pulled off by the participants prime.But also being of that much former age of news style! How it was handled and reported then in the 1950's until about 1995 or so? Well, this details. And all the details are tremendously ones of minutia research and insight into the base 9 or 10 personalities. Because NOWHERE is the leadership and philosophy and politico and religion all so mixed into a nearly incestuous group of the same people with the same last names. The ""chosen""- so to speak. Caste system also firmly planted for both association and outcomes, IMHO.But Alex von Tunzelmann sure did a work of recording here. It's not just a history but almost memoir like for 4 or 5 of the core movers and shakers. And did they live lives! No superlative I could put would encompass their travels, their associations of intimacy with rulers as friends. And at the very crux was Lord Mountbatten and his wife. Man, was she a piece of work. Never stopping, always plugging on to the next port, city, capital, mountain, sea or Nehru destination. And the violence and deaths after geographic and country title governmental separations (several with the Pakistans and the other regions that border)! Quotes all quite apt in process and aftermaths. A single death is a tragedy and a couple million annihilations just stats. Same today. Maybe even more so today. And not only in India either.The most enlightening and surprising (both) for my read was the true nature and philosophy and life decision voicing of Gandhi. Letting his wife die because penicillin might harm her God dealt karma. And the advise he gave to vast numbers of people to just submit to death rather than protest their home moves or be violent in return etc. And his life treatments of his family members (4 sons especially- was no less than atrocious). Today he would be considered evil by the current crowd where it is all about feelings and payback demanded. While in his time he was considered a saint. Still is by more than just some. But the duo of Nehru and him together! Read it all. Factions SO different but combined as mighty for specific periods of immense danger and change.Very difficult read. The aftermath of the IRA bombing and much else, I lived through and remember well. I also knew how bad Dickie was as a naval officer too. The wrecks and the oops of ships' accidents over and over again. But going out probably exactly as he would wish. Queen Elizabeth and the entire family was truly heartbroken.I think Alex was enthralled by Edwina (Dickie's wife and Nehru's mistress) SO much that I almost gave it a 4 star. (A quarter of all the contretemps is of her initiation or interchanges, IMHO.) But no, it deserves all 5. Intrepid is saying it mildly for all of them. Photos were excellent. I remember that one with JFK when it was new.Horrible, horrible religious crux disagreements which continue to foist HUGE violence, death, tragedy on millions continue (mostly farmer or untouchable millions). Also flood, starvation, disease etc. kill entire populations of other small countries at a time. And the politico dancing is STILL not all that different. Not even to the sex tenets or birth control reality. The population (India territory only) is going to surpass China's. Quite soon. Read this for Mahatma's treatments to others alone, if nothing else is credible to you. You may think the middle ages Church was sex activity opposed! Celibacy and suicidal types of death were his sacraments. Or living short brutal lives by a going back to nothing but dirt and rag surrounded trunk because it was the most perfect for karma. Sick.It has about a dozen or more pages of footnotes and bibliography and more research pages than any book I've read in the last 3 years. But it will be a truly HARD read for those with opinion or theory based history practice habits. Like everyone under 35 years old or so. This is facts straight said, and not a treatise on colonialism. It's how and why and where and what went down. Before, during, after. Excellent.

It is. And especially gives a more than average quality account for Boston, Cambridge etc. during this Puritan immigrant period.

This is a favorite author for sure, mine too- but length, breadth, and continuity here? Way below par for Robert Harris. Below par for the complexity and length of copy too. My bar is high for the author of Munich, for all of those top notch Roman series based books etc. This one does not begin to rise to the midst of their quality. 2.5 stars and I cannot round it up.Telling, telling, telling this tale, and when there is the showing and doing it is verbosity times a dozen to make the telling fit. In such times as prime obsessions of either religious or delusional dictates taken as an entire fever of life plan? It could have burned so differently. This stands apart and besides the primes on both sides here and doesn't exist for the ""eyes"" of the true believer intensity except in some Scripture asides or a page here or there. Hard to accomplish this droning calm that lengths of this did, but Harris actually diminished all the fire. Harris made the martyrdom and fervor elements become almost secondary. When in all reality they were staunch core center. Still are, ironically. Just like true ""woke"" or ""green at any cost"" true believers. Core religion ""this way or no way"" fervor was elemental here. Wordiness just killed it with diluting distraction.This length and form did not do the subject justice. Roundheads indeed of every form and dogma! Still deluded, obsessed and just as intolerant for their current ""you must believe this redefinition for reality"" or ""else"" quotients for continual preaching. What a subject matter to attempt too in 2020 plus! The know better enlightened condescending are so visible and audible presently that this particular historical sequence did not have to be so splintered and with such minutia redundancy of tangent asides. WE GET IT. Cromwell's way or no way and the hell with any aftermaths. And revenge back to the last nasty justified. A better kingdom awaits for the true believers and social justice warriors that will make us all equal or else, regardless. Preach, teach and rule as new DEFINED and REDEFINED ""true"" is an old thing and an always thing. Hard to make it so mundane as here. Just the religions have changed and are not designated AS religion any more. But they are whole piece nearly identical.My least favorite book by Harris for all these long years of his writing excellence. That's exactly why I could not raise the bar to round it up. I'll still try all he writes. But this was truly disappointing. After all these pages and people I also did not feel Nayler as a real person. Just as one dimensional as a super hero with almost nil personality or individuality in all these lengths of print. Reminded me of the long search for ""the one armed man"" in tv past.

Excellent, excellent writer and intense multiple character driven plots. Also the coppers called the Bastards from the Pizzofalcone district of Naples come out in splendid, splendid individualist forms for practice. Each with their own particular expertise. And it's all done by doing and showing and not telling. For police procedurals that's rare. Very. These are difficult, difficult reads. Don't believe that for this common genre that the forms OR the substances are common, cozy, simple, nice, clear etc. No, and it sure doesn't suffer fools. In fact, I was entirely taken aback at the end. It's hard to do any reaction without that tend to hint spoilers.The Chinaman is core, but this one gives you the heart lowdown and psychology actings out of both Romano and Aragona. What a team they are! Because I have seen the Italian TV series in parts, I can picture them perfectly as well. The violent streak restrained in Romano is VERY well acted but in print you still get the clear interior volcano, as well.Women are also never secondary characters in any of these. Especially within the characters met, interviewed or perp maybes. But also Laura, Otto, and Di Nardo are full blown 1000 sided daily human and depths interesting. That's even rarer for police procedurals, IMHO. Only within some of the Nordic have I felt the deep portrayals as exquisitely vivid too for the pulls of hours for their lives.Regardless, this is my second de Giovanni and I now am starting to understand his soliloquy tendency. It kept me from giving a 5 star to this one and the one I read that was the base book for ""the Bastards"" precinct. Now I will expect it. It's either lyrical 4 page flowering or like in this one a talk to the ""fates"" (almost exactly how Shakespeare used the soliloquy to the audience in his plays). This one ranged wild for 5 or 7 pages about the month of May. It holds foreboding and also mood beyond the literal meanings. I didn't really understand that feature with Book 1 Bastards. But I will now. I would not have been so shocked if I had understood this. Sometimes I am dense with effusion explosions. Or rails against eternity. But in Italian materials I should, more than most, understand and come to accept it will blow eventually. So culturally apt that I can not even go there. But be warned. This one gets noir. Not graphic noir but dark as I would wont to go. Although this probably seals the team in the large common office to a steely and welded long term future. 20 more books? I sure hope so. This is difficult reading. I have to take these at the pace of non-fiction and it takes me almost 3 times as long to read as a common copper or fiction drama of the same number of pages. Because the forms are so superb, twisted into shapes and also translated to a 10 stars out of 10 degree. Humor also lives. I love when they get some old American sit-come or action/drama tv series off or distorted. That's exactly what happens when I see some other languaged (other than English) movies. I do subtitles well and understand some of the French and Italian if they are not screaming.You will see me read all of these Bastards. The tv series is so sublime and gorgeous for scenery that I recommend that too. MHZ held but I got Series 1 from my Library System. The actors are best I've seen outside of the ACORN Media cast. And the interiors of the flats and apartments! OMG, will my part of the world ever get away from the ALL white and gray bilge that has been foisted for over a decade now. Gorgeous views from the tops too. Volcano/ bay of Naples with the always crane- 6 stars.Almost forget. I am just guessing- but that one star Italian voice protest  is probably about either the law or the ending here. I'd bet on it. That freezing of everyone's funds? Shocking to me that the government does that to the victims. Several aspects of Italian law give me an instant sense of abomination actually. That's not the most over-bearing. Beyond that reality, it let's me totally understand why so much is under the table or authority avoiding or just plain common not abiding (paying taxes!) at all in Italy. ALL parts of Italy.

Not from boredom, but because it kept me up at night.The job Phoebe does was intriguing. I have know someone who didn't do reconstruction in the mortuary but did hair and makeup. This always made me wonder why the posit wasn't set into a good novel. And could it be. Well, here it is.Banner has become a go to author for me. My library system doesn't hold much, but I'll read the rest I have not read so far regardless. But this one was excellent. And with a subject too that I seldom abide well- lost or passed or stolen or no longer here children. Mothers of essential missing. And the myriad of emotional obsession was handled in 4 dimensions here. Dialogue not as well, though. It loses a whole star in the conversations at points, IMHO. 36 or 40 year old girlfriends don't talk like they are 19. Not even in crux stresses.Something published in 2021 without revolving times or switching narrators or huge time lapse voids. Will miracles never cease! This was a good book for a holiday weekend night (Labor Day USA) when all the crazy people were attending out of doors parties and shrieking loudly way past the usual. I'm sure I couldn't do Phoebe's job.

Not just because of the star rating decision either. I could go too long so I am excluding some core aspects of this setup in the reaction. But here's how I got to 4 stars.The entire first half of this lengthy thriller genre was about 2 to 2.5 stars for my read. I actually had it sitting- put back in the pile because at about page 200, I was going to make it a DNF. Repetition and minutia for pages upon pages. And I already guessed the perp too. And I was correct. Plus I never at all experienced the ""can't put it down"" factor that other ers state. Not at all. The question of Brie in the now was also not much interest on my plate. 6 years? Come on. Reality! And the red flags with the amateur acting association! And I was SO sick of Isabel's mouth. More than Norman was.But then about 2/3rds through the book, the switching and voids developed a continuity and action sequences that put it into an entirely different pace. And they were very good in locations and composites. Very much in a screen writer film placement beyond just the juxtapositions of the prime characters in this rapidly developing sets of events and movements. Elizabeth's death changes it all.So the teenage brother? That going back and listening to Cam? Nope. Even teenagers are not that stupid. Not alone and in as much complications as he had committed already. But this is fiction, so I swallowed that action. Teenagers are sneaky- they don't reveal like that in the open. Especially not the juveniles who are still tipping over gravestones for fun. And I really do not get the depth of how many ers (I read a bunch of s here after I finished this book, not before) were not sure of the evil perpetrator at the core of the 2016 happenings. There were HUGE giveaways. The gushing habit especially. Anyway- the ending with the extra twist was movie worthy too I guess. But I did not love this tale as much as some of his others and never felt the 5 star at all as many other readers did. 3.5 rounded up for the shovel scenario chapter and the one before and after it. But uneven overall and way too long. At least 50 pages, maybe 75 pages of this were filler. He kept Jayne mostly ""out"" of the continual relationship rehashing repeats.

Because I could go very long but I will try to be reactive. This is an extremely difficult to do . Almost like my Pachinko one. How did I get to 3 stars? Because it could be anywhere from 1 to 4 stars easily if you take in the aspects of approach, detailing, aftermath here. And I do have enough background, education and practice to also admit some HUGE departures from the title subjects that I noticed. But I am also grading on the kind side for the lengthy detail, witness, wording or other research done well. But OMG, are there a lot of voids too. Most especially with Bella and her voice and intersects of length. They are just not there as the victim refused all interviews. She has lifelong 19 deep stab wounds after effects. The physical and mental legacy has to be astronomical. 12 year old girls all.I was enthralled and read this within a day. In fact, up until about the exact mid point of the book it was over a 4 star for me. 4.5 stars. Especially within the thorough reality detail of the Morgan, Anissa, Bella home life and schooling minutia. What a window! Overall it is 2.5 stars rounded up for the pre-crime exactness reports.But then. After the crime. And throughout the rest of the long history and intersects with law and futures? Well, to say that Kathleen Hale is slanted would be saying it mildly. In fact, she seems, to me anyway, almost as quirky ""off"" as some of the earlier 12 year old girls' posits of ""truth"". And in at least 3 law interpretations I also found her nearly 100% off the target. Hale seems to believe in a more ""woke"" bottom line of who was actually the victim. Or victims. Or what is just as punishment, housing, medicine or rehabilitation. In short time or long years aspects both. And she also sets in short sections of politico which had nothing whatsoever to do with the book's subject or the depth of psychosis which core it.This is a case of ""folie a deux"". Clearly it is. There is nearly no disagreement upon the horrific nature of it either. And the victim was Bella. The victim is not Morgan, and the victim is not Anissa. And the way this is told, and the entire mental health treatments after the bloody walk through Walmart? Those girls had top rung and Hale makes it sound like they were ""put upon"". Either without the right medicines or then WITH the right medicines. (Because all of those meds DO cause very bad side effects as well.) So first she complains there are NO medicines and then complains when there are. Poor Morgan? How could any law, state dictate WIN according to Kathleen Hale. This is a case of me knowing way too much about how this goes down (DSM-V) and also about WI (state law and culture) and how psychosis is determined within school populations. Any age schooling. And were the flags all missed here. Every teacher I know who has been a professional for over 20 years has had to report student with observable criteria far less than Morgan's were. And that was covered VERY little in this book. Some years my daughter has had to remove 2 or 3 students out of 60 per grade that do not belong for safety in the public school classroom. Inclusion be damned. Self-harm or such observable psychosis actions are dangerous in classroom density. Yes, I do understand how most teachers have no time or background depth in mental illness windows as opposed to abnormal developments or acting out or whatever. But STILL. Many of Morgan's behaviors in group were way beyond the outlier for this to be ignored.So sorry for length, but this gets dicey. I wonder if Hale is off. She has some delusions equal to Anissa's for reality of Slenderman's powers. Hers are of the brainwashed elitist variety though. Not about a Slenderman though, but about base reality of everyday school and law juxtapositions. And the moralities involved, as well. Murder and horrific long term bodily harm (like castration, mutilation of body parts, stunting of normal hormone productions etc.) are all just fine and dandy if delusion must be served? How subjective!So take this one with a big grain of salt. Girls in this were lethal. And their outcomes extremely more advantageous than majority of mental health psychotics or felons who are left without shelter or supervisions in every geographic location on Earth. So here you do NOT get a balanced view of this particular case of terrible, terrible stabbings etc. What you DO get is an above average insight into detailing of the progression and days leading up to the horror. And the exact mindsets of the two girls who enabled it to come full circle accomplished. The voice and cognition both of the victim is nearly absent. And as for the online obsession issue- this could have happened with any pretend ""entity"". It has in the past with witches, or vampire tales, or goblins or 1000 other characters make mighty by imagination. Only difference is that the internet seemed to make it more easily believable to the super immature and bored. But it could have happened too and HAS with just games and talk.

The read was delightful and almost a complete departure from the current modern too. All the people were far from despicable, actually. Even the perps had some redeeming qualities. And the group of cops from the district of Pizzofalcone! The ones called the Bastards. They each and every one are culturally carved in nuance, appearance, methods, and especially in voice reflecting their core emotions. Which isn't the usual for cop copy fare.Different ages and in various parts of the life stream. 2 women and 4 or 5 men (if counting the boss). And a prose flow that is also unusual. Difficult but in mood and action sense so very Italian. Kudos to the translator.The beginning is a 9 out of 10 in difficulty scale. But once you get all their nicknames, surnames and most usual means of duty proceeding- it gets easier. Not easy, but easier. This is NOT an easy read.Not cozy, but also not brutal. Logic and order and tradition are mightily served. It's quite real. The story of the MOTHER yeast and the baker with his role of centuries? Loved it.3 or 4 cases all entwined and each gets an answer. That is also unusual. And Naples and Southern Italy are HUGE core stars. Sardinia, Sicily alive. And quite authentic, not dressed up or Mafia disguised either.

This particular would make an excellent film or even a series. All I wanted was for Montalbano to show up or consult!Nearly a 5 for me. And I could put it down because the continuity did jump within the cases and the various prime Bastard's inquiry. But the timing was chronological and clear. Tons of personality quirk jokes and considerable marriage cheating here. Not with our coppers. The parts with Romano who found the infant girl in the dumpster and aftermath were 5 stars.

I thought I knew but I truly didn't.That's what I love about non-fiction. It teaches you. What you see on TV is not the pawning, but the buying/selling aspects. Pawning is entirely different. And storage needed to do this is multiple, multiples beyond the sizes and spaces of the pawnshop or front desk or displays etc. It's massive. Pawned OR bought items have to be listed and police searched item by item for 1 month before they are even ""stored"" for the next part of the resale or 6 month wait to see if the pawn customer comes back to pay his bill/interest and/or retrieve her/his items. It's complicated. And very, very register and legal aspects heavy. EVERY item has to be searched for the multiple reasons of being stolen or illegal or whatever else the police decide makes it ""theirs"". (Patriot Act made this even more lengthy and invasive a process.) He is the credit source for all the people who cannot afford a bank account or have zero credit available to them. Banks and money available for the bankless. And are there RULES. You do need to have a good number ability in your head to even begin this process. Costs are mighty for all that storage. In Vegas it is not air conditioned either- huge warehouse. And he doesn't make Chumlee go back to work there either- that's just a joke used on the program. Although both younger members you see have worked all the hard jobs. Over night window duty for years too each. Which is tricky and alone. You are behind a huge glass enclosed bullet proof extension with one slot to get things through. ALL NIGHT from closing to 6 am in the morning. And that wasn't the hardest jobs. Not easy work.Rick is a superb writer for memory and for exchanges. He also has HUGE historic or manufacturing history knowledge. He knows more about power tools or grinders than he does about jewelry. And about jewelry he knows a TON. The book and kindle contains some 6 star photos of his ""keepers"". Strange choices, very interesting. I had no idea that they saw all types of humans and in every condition you could imagine or begin to describe. Or that the 4 main people you see on tv can no longer work any front desk (not since show 1 either) because pawning is a ""privacy protected"" action by law. What you see is sales. Very different. And they are staged with the shop being closed and just a few random customers allowed to roam and look. This was written in 2011 and his Dad has passed since then. There is a short section written by his Dad and two others by Corey and Chumlee. They both have harrowing tales to tell too, as their lives were NOT the silver spoon variety. Not at all. Both had biological mothers who left with no forwarding address. Their sections were as interesting as Rick's was. Corey spent 5 ""lost"" years- you have to hear this tale.Great stories. Rick proves the old adage that the worst childhoods often insure the most incredible success outcomes. I've seen this in at least 10 people personally. Terrible at school, filled with sickness and disability- you name it. Parents that are workaholics and don't much supervise is also a huge plus for some people who know what they want and how to do it young. No stoppers. Rick had grand mal seizures and temporary (but he didn't know that at all) blindness repeatedly at 16. He spent days a month at doctors (from 8 to 17) waiting in Armed Services (Navy, his dad) lines for different blood tests or whatever else they were going to try or evaluate. He missed at least 1 week a month from school. Usually 2. And he didn't finish h.s. And yet he read constantly. Do the people of Goodreads, understand THAT. Don't even talk to him about government medicine systems.Strongly recommend reading this book. His people tales are IMMENSE lessons for how people live their lives the way they WANT TO LIVE THEIR lives. And all the roads to happy are NOT the safe, nor the fully responsible either. Gambling itself is a tremendous middle part here of this book. It made me think very differently than what I assumed about gamblers. Or even the ones I've known who seldom stop. Very informative.Could I drop all sentimentality as this family has with ""stuff""? I doubt it. But I love to watch the show (and History channel in general too) and especially historic antiques. I just had no idea how many power saws you can get during a building recession or complete housing collapse market. Or what you have to ""eat"" when 2000 grinders or tile cutters are cleared by everyone and then 2 years later you find they were employee stolen but never reported. And now you have to pay for all of them sold and return the rest.And you got to watch all of yours too. MANY employees now, and for 15 years at least. Closely. There are just as many cameras and security at Gold & Silver than there are in the casinos. Some days, even more.Great read. And I always have known those permits (even the lottery ones) that cities supposedly give fairly for licensing are 90% fixed. You donate to the politician is the first step. Rick had to call every week for years and years first thing in the morning to get the first one that came up with residency counts changing constantly because for decades there was status quo limit. And it took a court case to get it made official after the first issue too, on top of it. The big pawn chains were in the fix. And the shop is in a bad neighborhood.

Best fiction I have read for a modern Chinese writer. Review tomorrow. Translator did quite a job. Kudos.This work does not suffer fools. The author entwines and embeds but at the same time many elemental factors are widely scattered. In time elements, in generational directions, within tremendous authority upheavals. You name it for historic or abstract bents (either) and you will get it all dished out pell-mell mixed. And it's also succinct amid language flow which I find, I did myself, unique for anything Chinese I've ever read. Order and wit are also different. Everything is like turned inside out and the matter and seams ""inside"" are exposed. Not being a fan of magic realism much at all, there are elements here that also become mystical or almost Greek gods or ""other world"" drifting. Especially within the dance related novella which also bridge crossed Christianity.See, it's complex. I would give the first two novellas a full five. The third one? 4.5 stars and I still really don't understand most of it. But I will reread it at a much later date and see what I ""pick out"" then. Because that's what is true for all of these. Masterful writing, filled with reality and yet tragic and then yet inspirational and then yet despair. It's a viscous mix. And also many points are gorgeous and cyclical both.When I think of the 400 to 700 pagers I've read that say next to nothing. Especially about China and its experiences of the last 100 years! STRONGLY recommend this book. A gem and almost completely unsung in any book listing publications I've read re recent publishing. Put your true thinking caps on and read of these journeys. Some looking for mothers or livelihoods. Others looking merely for warmth. Or for food. Or for trust. Or for creative muses. Brutality times ten but it isn't demonstrated or exposed or described like it would be in any Western sense much at all. Especially within language of anger or acts. That's what I LOVED the most about these. Their complete Chinese cognition is showing. Over and over. And the expressions! What a translator. Here I want to put about 30 phrases with ultimate nuances in short quirk which I'm sure have absolutely accurate meanings for Chinese now and then. But no, you find them. But be aware too that the punctuation is not ""norm"" or English slanted whatsoever. And that voice and thoughts and times not only switch but there are voids to cross, as well.This author is described in trailers as frank. Oh yes! As soon as his other masses of stuff get translated, I'll be reading it. Just a master with the big L for literary or lyrical or love. Quite beyond all the other Chinese fiction nuance I've read. Which is probably at least 60 to 100 of them over the years.So come to the frigid Northeast which isn't that far from the North Korean border. To Shenyang and into Shuang Xuetao's old neighborhood. And over the mighty hills of revolution, Communism, and into the ditches or culverts scattered with array of social ills from market economies. Gritty and yet absolutely funny as well. So glad I picked it up just from the cover. And when I had WAY too many modern YA level sense in the pile that are currently billed thriller or psychological novels.As these characters actually say once in the last novella- ""he has a high class disease.""

She writes clearly but at a very elemental/ base level of cognitive introduction and knowledge. It is a HUGE and to me enthralling area of both medical and psychological inquiry. And here she takes more medical or total novice material. An almost amateur track to both defining and explaining process. And because I worked in cognition studies during graduate schools over decades of changes in the field- plus all my tracking experience- this wasn't at all ""my bag"".

Elvis I've read probably 10 to 15 books back in the day and for Lennon about 1/2 of that. I also have read non-fiction on Mohammed Ali, but this book was much more specific and interested me far more than the others of decades past. This gave me greater insight into the decision making to do those fights after he was 32. The Mohammed Ali section was close to a 5. He was a smart and savvy individual who knew what he believed and tried to live it. But like many of us, his financial and personal lives were hugely detrimental to him as a person- both physically and mentally. And for pure greed he was physically manipulated and destroyed without much quibbling about it, as well. Because the Nation of Islam and much else of his manager and financial guru's life was in Chicago, I have witnessed some of the criminal behaviors involved myself. But putting him through that much harm after terrible injury, again and again with so much slanted money going to nearly everybody by Ali? Oh the people who gained over his misery! Terrible. I do remember the torch lighting ceremony at the Olympics. Touching plus.All three tales were researched to the max. But each life had so many horrific negatives based within the characters and habits of the 3 themselves? Well, it is hard to tell stories of addicts in any sense. Or in most any addictions, as well. Heroin and opiods or attention. But still addiction plus. But especially within the spheres of great celebrity. But all three lived within huge dependencies to stronger personalities and whims and were manipulated far, far more than it looked from the outside. Lastly, Ono was continually made the bad guy in nearly ever sense of talent use or lifestyle or break up choices etc. It's not true. I always knew that too.

Yes, I thought it would be more enthralling, or exciting, or convoluted or mysterious. But it was merely good and also long. It actually patterned a speed by which such scenarios are investigated in real life present 2022. DNA helps but at times it just opens the door for 50 more questionings. As it did here. All takes time and is hours and hours of inquiry.After Rose in the care home kept mentioning Jean hit ""someone"" - I had huge inkling where this was going. So I guess, I read too many of these English who-dun-its. My surmise was not exactly right but quite close. It's the particular speed and connotation style that made me round this down 1 whole star. Very word repeating, and also extremely clothing related. Not only in descriptive moxie of first introduction, but in the constantly taking off or putting on coats, jackets, tams, sweaters, different heeled shoes etc. etc. Having read about 10 Italian translated fiction pieces in the last month, I recognize that over abundance in several different Italian authors, as well. I'm patient. But I wish a better edit was done so that this or some ""bush tea"" detail is not ever again and again presented. It never helps a book. In this one it was so heavy that it almost buried the huge intrigues of sneaky subterfuge. Overall though, the author has hit a core issue that is seldom crux any longer. In another age, it was far more common. Too much individual forensics to nail in this present day to format or even initiate this plot scenario easily. Now, this ploy gets caught faster than 40 years later. Not always, but close to always. Very rare to win this game while staying in the same country.You know there is another factor that truly took my enjoyment of this book down a peg. It was hard to return to and took me nearly a week.

One family is swirling down and the other going up. Both are in mid flights over the course of a century or two in economic and cultural senses. Do I agree with the nuance and voices which do the telling and the showing? In some cases, not at all. But her characters and forms are way above average for fiction presently. She does a type of bordering run-on sentence which leaves the speaker or descriptive mode almost breathless. And yet somehow this cuts to the essence quick. Her context for nearly everything involved for the entire scenario also embedded. Not creating voids of ""mystery"" instead (real holes in information) as is the habit in this family epic telling that has become endemic in large majority of publications this last decade. Almost as much as the switch, switch, switch craze.Knowing nothing at all beforehand was also something that made the experience enhanced. The less you know the better.She also holds a considerable ""snob"" cornered distinctions within herself, I think. That's why, IMHO, the first novel was better because she knows FAR MORE about that course. I would have given it a 5 star if standalone.

Oh William! was a top five read of the year. This one disappointed. It's mundane, sad and nearly petty. Like gossip in comparison to a witty or savvy observation reveal conversation. There is a difference. This was old news rehashed for more reaction but all the freshness of the earlier Lucy was, for me, completely gone. The vibe is cranky. And elitist cranky on top of it. And the entire tale as a whole, just depressing. Every aspect you could easily name/ describe in Lucy for this Covid and after period is reactive behaviors. Who would guess that someone with SO many dislikes would take the path of least resistance and become closer to dependent turgid. Fear coupled with drama of angst is and never will be my favorite core topics. UGH! And I don't even begin to like William, on top of it. Nor his dominant bullying habits.

The bull was the best character in the book.The bottom line human heart and ambition that was in the earlier Falco is entirely missing. Plus Albia personality seems set in concrete at the age of about 22, not in her 30's as supposed. Her heart especially seems to have gotten lost.

Need a keyboard and some pondering. Both. I wanted to give 4 stars for the last quarter but just cannot. This needed a much better edit. Specifics quite beyond the levels of character building need to be addressed for this novel's prose form and pace. Coming soon to this spot. I very much like her earlier work and I am glad I stuck with this one. Although it was super close to being a DNF at page 245.Addressing the issues follows. Very much needed because she is not getting better at her writing. Quite the opposite.FORMS and pace here! Not even a 2 star for 10 or 30 pages at a time during the first half of this book. And you cannot, if you are an English author- even one who attempts dialect, you CANNOT use the same words and exact phrasing over and over and over again. Seriously, I started to count. It was a joke. 10 people of relative same ages and also VERY few, if any, of the generation older than they. But the WORDING and circular repetition of ""facts"". Both are atrocious. Off to uni, back to uni, not needing uni, bored with uni, and the footy too. And mate! Do I call someone mate 30 times an evening? People do not TALK in this mode. Nope. Australian or not. Watch Australian telly (here we go again) series. They do not. Nor do they speak about themselves in adjective phrasing. This was TERRIBLE writing. Beyond filler copy in repetitions too, it also could have been edited by at least half of the count in the first 245 pages. And no one notices in these s? I only see one post who understands that the character building, though attempted deep, in pacing and in emphasis for the same exact traits and feelings was off. Pace failure dropped all tension in this book. There was NO tension in this book until the Gemma/Aaron assumptions/conclusion decisions at the ending. Aaron, himself, and his eventual decision- that was even stymied flat.A slow and tedious character building can almost always be somewhat necessary. But not done this way and for these many comrades. Circular timing with flashback of 20 years too for the Festival weekend when Kim went blanko? Plus telling the same facts over and over again. And how about Shane? Was he detailed at his soccer and being the far past sports hero enough? Ridiculous how these few friends were posited over and over and over. And yet some of them STILL remained just shallow stereotype. And the finale STILL had to be told in flashback on top of it. UGH!This is an author I liked and who had two first published that were head and shoulders writing over these last two novel samples of hers. Very disappointed. Is someone editing these at all? What direction of publisher is she at all getting?Also, there is a HUGE outlier feature that made the middle 300 pages hard to read. Why are the Raco brothers hosting a christening for a baby or toddler (repeat after 1 year because of tragedy) Zoe. Zoe is a child that is NOT related to them and an offspring of their ex-sister-in-law's 2nd marriage. If I had tried to pull that off- it would have caused more than a missing person at a festival, let me tell you. Note that Zara is the ONLY person related to all these Zoe's christening party folk. And she is only 17. Is she hosting a party at a vineyard of this type? Does anyone who reads this not understand what a stretch this one was. COME ON! And yet all the older people (above 40) are footnotes of far away or rare conversation? And the people who are waiting for the star baby to arrive, they don't even have anyone at the house to do appropriations? And even if Aaron is a best buddy life long friend? He gets the cabin etc. as god father- right? BUT it isn't their niece, nor is it their closest friend's kid. So many features here that were like The Breakfast Club gone wonky. Are these people 38 or 16? Often they speak like the latter.There are MORE criticisms I could specify. Australia nature itself was not given its due. Only because of the last fifth of this book did I give it the 3rd star. The ratings on this one are overblown ridiculous. And I knew the crux of the missing Kim question from about page 40 too. They could not have been that dense- all these people. All those people who have been trying to get ""in touch"" too for over a year or two? And the paint color aspect that was given many paragraphs in police headquarters description! Dead giveaway. I knew before page 245 who had altered that situation also. The only reason I kept reading this novel was because it was -5 degrees F out and I didn't want to get into the elements to pick up my other books waiting. Please publishers, editors.

It has not been ""neglected"" so much, as rare in the USA. It still is rare. It is a American Subtropical parasitic insect and other vectors (bed bugs seem to be able to pass it from infected carriers is just now being determined) disease. But it is only one of many dozens of subtropical parasitic disease. No, 100's. The book itself is all over the place and more a journal of her family's up and back to Colombia/ New Jersey or USA locations, her own cultural blitzes for her relationships with them re her sexuality and other family truth or explanation issues- and about 10% editorializing her bitterness upon colonist theory of blame game. Very ironic in title too since the treatments her own family have experienced! Her aunt and numerous others coming in and out of aftermaths- received huge surgeries (even heart transplant in a case or two) without humongous costs or any non-availability they would have gotten or experienced in any of their home nations. She is bitter and she luckily isn't even positive within Chagas testing of herself. Many more books are out there or information online re chagas disease. Vectors exist beyond the insects. Dogs and other mammals carry chagas. It has been one of many insect related horrifics for humans of ancient, millennia past, recent, or present day history. Other diseases like Malaria are still devastating entire continents at the rate of killing and minimum debilitation of over 241 million people a year (2020 stat). So having about 500 or 600 people in the entire USA treated for this in comparison? Like 100 other diseases borne from insects and poverty- most of the prevention is not getting bit. But there are facilities to test for chagas in anyone's blood (nearly all countries and USA or Europe absolutely), just as there are for AIDS or many other factors of disease aftermath or parasitic infection. This report overall- would lead you to believe that chagas is not addressed in testing nor in attempted treatments throughout most of North America. That's untrue.This actually got my ire up a bit since I spent my first 7 or 8 years exactly as she did in the bed/family/housing etc. situation. Poverty spreads disease. It isn't only chagas. Density living arrangements in a subtropical climate pass worms and dozens of other parasitic or infectious conditions. Do I know. Other climates have other bugs and other parasites (even fresh water lakes do). Like cockroaches or various stingers or suckers (bed bugs) which pass filths of other terrible end stage conditions. So in comparison and in prospective of counter actions, this book was hugely off in ""neglect"" perspective. And yet once or twice she got some worthwhile information in there. Barely.There is one morsel I learned here that I didn't know.

So, for me, some of the numerous Reacher fisticuffs etc. became not the usual ""hard to believe"" but over the top to impossible. Especially within that prison in core sections near the ending. It also was just a trifle too long. Reacher is more the personality of his first 23 books, but not quite. He always seems a lot harder and far more humorless since Andrew became the 2nd writer. But Reacher IS older. But on that diet he and Hannah have in this book? How could he be such a super man and fast healer? All the locations and the driving/traveling for at least 10 characters! That I loved. 5 star in placements and in crux plotting issue. I thought it was all about drugs and just drugs or tech, and missed the main core onus of Minerva. Overall, it held way too much technical and physical location and forms description. I had to stop several times as I was so sated with that and little else but the travel serendipity. For not having a phone of his own, Reacher sure has acquired sidekicks that always are phone gurus. Again, this time.So, overall, a good read- but not up to the level of some of his first dozen, the fourth star was rewarded in that it was an improvement too over the zombie killer Reacher in that one outlier published a few years ago. And once again, since Andrew joined the write- the prose flow is far more complex and convoluted. The short static sentence and tone is NOT there much. I miss it.Since Andrew joined the write, I feel that there is FAR less Reacher serendipity joy or interlude recreation in any of the copy than there was before he co-wrote.

And Jo Ann described her guessing scenarios for the ""real news"" exactly right. That was a 5 star reveal. No little thing to do..She puts her childhood memories to a 5 star degree of detail. That was intense. And exceptionally delightful to read. That's exactly how it was. I could have been twins with her big sister. And Jo Ann was always Miss Sensitivity. NO change whatsoever.

And I miss it. No porno scenes, far more emotional roller coasters. As that age actually is in reality for the majority of us.Why the heck didn't she just kick Eric out and never answer the calls? Probably for the same reason she never had kids? She can't go all the way in faith or karma of the future's open path? I thought she skirted that issue far more in her other autobiographical stories. In this one, she was still half baked about her own knowledge of herself. Always, always noting every detail to the max around her though. Extremely outlier and very lasting visual memory.She gets hurt by the least inconsequence of comments. She still can't get by any minor perceived dis- almost enshrining them on a scoreboard count. And yet she is definitely fun. I hope she always has her dogs and some trusted friends. But I was surprised at the content of these because I didn't get what I read in s.

But neither does Lu.The ending also seemed beyond my ability to swallow such an outcome. Not that it could be IMPOSSIBLE to happen, but so very much doubt that it would. Lu has principles. Almost no one in this system does. But I learned an immense amount about Chinese present law. Especially for country people of origin to go to the city or urban anywhere. Or how other ethnicity beyond Han are embedded. Or not. Like the Hui numbers who ended up in China across the borders from Muslim civil and other district wars. We all know about the Uyghur populations but there are others too. Some with entirely singular dress and huge populations. This was probably the most instructive fiction book I have come across in this genre for years. How Chinese laws work in reality practicality and process!

This is a 2019 redo with the ending added and the more fully intact recounting of his summer of 1988. It reminds me in scope of Ann Rule's Stranger Beside Me concerning her life history tale of working at a desk next to Ted Bundy and all of the aftermath. Only this holds far more depth and at least 20 carved to the soul characters. And at least 50 more with whole cut recognition.Highly autobiographical but twice the nuance of his town to go with that aspect. Edgewood is crux center. It is also a love letter to this, his small home town in Maryland. Photos helped make this, all the short cuts, most of the streets and gully culverts, playgrounds, creeks, llibrary, 7-11 and the hills of residences! They all came fully alive during the ""great change"" of nearly everything for that 1988 period that could have come out of a horror movie. Quite literally scouring grief, fear, anger and dread throughout all the residents. Because they knew a serial killer was among them.I couldn't put it down. Despite at least half the copy being Richard at 22 years of age being mindfully stream of consciousness for all the earlier Richards and his escapades. And also his family's. And his associations of close friends to ""lady I see once in awhile at the grocery"". You knew this town enough to know which church pew was shared and who did the most dare devilish bike jumps after a straight downhill 2 or 3 block approach. I was actually surprised at my own appreciation for most of these exact tales of mayhem or juvenile disaster too. Usually and now for sure, this exact kind of boys will be boys imagination nasty is more than disdained. But Richard Chizmar tells it well. In days before tech and cable amid the ""everyday"" bright or hazy spring, summer, fall, winter snow sludge skies.The photos of places and people were all 5 stars. Most by Richard himself back in the day during the period 1980's to 1994-95.Early, after the second murder had occurred, I had an inkling. But shed it. This is the type of 30 plus year history that could not happen any longer as easily as it did. Not with DNA or at least 4 other factors I could list. (They take FAR more note of parental reactions now then they once did, for one thing.) But his tribute and accounting of the strong decades of work our town detective headed was also a full 5 star. I was glad after the final justice of knowledge was achieved decades later, that he and Caryls went to visit this unsung hero's grave site. It's many that are like he was and lived. The ones who serve and never see the end state of their huge inputs and contributions.If you have any crime interest at all, I recommend. You will live a small town, just exactly as my own neighborhood was 60 or 70 years ago. Who knew the short cuts? Where was the best ice skating flats etc. 1000 games of imagination and use of sticks, rocks, construction hills etc. in all possible weather conditions. Who was ""weird"" or just obnoxious.

I only rounded it up for the premise which has quite a different slant than any Japanese culture set fiction I've read. It's time warp posit and that's not being done much by any fiction works in the last 10 to 20 years at all. Time travel is very different than a warp. The first half of the book was a quick, convoluted but interesting set of stories that interlocked. The form was a bit jumpy but done fairly well to nuance and moods, especially those. Then at almost exactly half way the jumps between the dozens of characters became greater and more forced. By the last 1/3rd of the book, the remnants were of the ""pick up"" variety. In other words, the links were so contrived and time related flyaway in core- that you were guessing more than half the time. Without the cultural road markers of timely entertainment or sequence of Beatles popularity or some other event like the Expo? The connections became far more tenuous. Karma and the good intent principle was still center, but not as it was during the first half of the book.And I just don't get how all of these law breakers just turn over to be good and gentile advice givers by a process of talk and teach. It's not just in this novel either but in majority Japanese tales. It's almost like foul play or violence or terrible theft or any criminal can be easily reformed by kindness and concern of the preach and teach. OH would it be so true in any real world! Anywhere.Also I loved some of the people exchanges but still don't feel the emotional core here. People are dying of cancer, or drowning, or leaving their family forever etc. VERY DIRE real. And the reaction? It's an almost ""oh, well""- on to the next thing. Sad but almost undiminished. Cultural mores but still? And suicide is always an option and seems nearly universal in thought patterns as an answer. To me it does.So the balance of conscience within the problem or General Store's advice in answer to the problem I ""get"" that depth. But I don't get the depth of reaction and play out of outcomes much at all in this quirky yarn. And I was pleasantly surprised at the crux here because it is much better than his detectives and their dialogues in his other books.This has a Hallmark worldview and conclusion. Others think it very heart warming. I did for the first half. After some of the sections, I felt nearly the opposite. Like putting a bandage upon an amputated stump. Not a kind thing at all.

Before I do a reaction, you should know something. I have only read 3 of these Montalbano books. But I saw all of the film from Sicily played on European television. That series is phenomenal. Perfect actors. Livia is beyond perfect (both were but especially the older version Sonia Bergamasco). Montalbano, Enzo, Mimi and Fazio are 6 stars. I'm not kidding. Angelo Russo who plays Caterella? OMG, he is 7 stars. But reading Caterella's speech patterns (screaming and entreating directions too), trying to decipher them in print with these approximate sound spellings and accents? It's difficult. Very. Much easier to view visuals than read the print versions of this excellent material.Regardless, see the series filmed in Sicily if you can access them. My view was from library CD's. There are something like 37 or 38 episodes ending in 1921. They started in the last 1990's. So they DO age. Everyone does as they do in the print, as well. And the Montalbano's meals are just as delicious. OMG, the rice balls episodes! Adelina's supreme. Vigata in the books is a fictional town, but filming is in Ragusa, Scicli (police station street) and in Punta Secca (Montalbano's house on the beach)- all done in Sicily. GORGEOUS.This particular book is a good pursuit of the local and strongest Mafia family embedded mess. And there are innocents swallowed up in the carnage. Fazio was especially tongue in cheek here too. EXCELLENT reaction for being criticized about the paper in his pocket with birth dates, status, address etc. Good one, Fazio.But as good as these books are in humor, the film is better. Mimi is in particular. You never get his always on the lookout for another girlfriend on the side vs his wife's schedule for him here as you do in the visuals. What an actor.

Only rounded it up because I didn't nail the killer, only getting by elimination down to two possibles. Hyperbole in this tale. Huge.It is so over the top far fetched that at points it seemed funny. But plotting overcame miserable illogical characters. Jayne was the only character that seemed at all operational on the whole. And the mountains of ridiculous emotion time and again? How could you have gotten through med school or any of these other long term high scale ""professions"" in their histories? That was pure fiction. Next day:The wider plotted elements of a long time best friends ""group"" of four friends this many years later was an excellent grid to all the carried forward decades baggage. That's the main reason I gave this a 4 star rating. YET, the characters were developed in such a way that these humans acted and responded in 2 stars way. Even within these impossible sets of consequences scenarios, the voids for this supposedly late 30 somethings to past 50 years old for one of them? Come on- what long term wife doesn't know her husband's mobile phone number? How could you lock all other humans OUT (no more explanations without a cheater detail) of such an overnight. And the forgetting or misplacing everything or the irks over very minor issues from the get go. Why would you want to begin a weekend vacation with them in these mood scenarios? So don't read this book if you are someone who says to yourself while reading ""why the heck would you ever do that there?"" Because you will be saying that to yourself consistently. The back story of Imogen, the 17 year old daughter, was the best part of the book. I have not read true crazy obsession written that well for years. Reminded me of the Yellow Wallpaper story of retro decades ago. Different gender for the mad person and different eras but similar depth of psychosis.Stupid and immature people all in a row.

For instance that it was never written in Aramaic (Jesus's language) but in Greek and other much later translated copy language from an ORAL tradition or very old former language sources. And that for centuries as in Christ's time, it was used as an ORAL form and purpose for parables of teaching and example. Not meant to be people common read.

I have always wondered what might have been revealed or altered by survival of so many other gospels and written records that were lost. Peter's and some of the others especially.

And later in the book, the Suburra in Rome. The barbarians, especially the Vandals are pouring across the Southern border, foodstuffs to living necessities (water, viaducts blocked etc.) are becoming scarcer daily. For all humans, those who are Roman citizens or not, it has become dire deadly. Sickness abounds. Inflation in costs for bread or oil have doubled and no one can afford what is there. (Does this begin to sound familiar?) Rioting mobs are killing shop owners with empty shelves. (More familiar.)This is the story of Leona, the partner to Aurelius (Augustine). Detailed and graphic to the world I have described briefly above. She is not his noble class, in fact as a teen ager she helps making cheese for most of her hours. That and home work with her sister, Numa. The first half of this book was a full 4 stars. I was embedded and the personalities were just carved. Although I must add that the writing form was so simple it did remind me at large lengths to a basic YA level of sentencing structure. They walked, they saw, they met etc. Very simple to the people in the couple's life. It's their love story and their life's story. Both.The second half of the book was barely 3 stars. 2.5 stars fairly. So I could not round this 3 star up as a total rating. Fevers, plagues, class laws, legionnaires who no longer speak Latin. Yet all groups are changing or have changed their religions too. For succor or for logical determinations, regardless. Sects of Christianity battling less too as the real migrations decimate the locals and the cultures that they have lived solidly and happily within for generations. And the separations are decades long. Leona and Augustine's son is the core pivot for great portions of the book. No spoilers. It puts you into another time and place. I so enjoyed hearing about the various foods, structures, and the Carthage Circus. Sad, sad, sad. But reflecting the reality of the real people who lived in this era. This is fiction, but not at all dissimilar than the majority for short lives of even a thousand years later. Before modern advantages, like electricity, mobility of later transportation forms or any medical knowledge of tools like penicillin that actually worked for curing in majority proportions. Philosophers turned holy bishops. Cheese girl turned leader of women's societal structure that later became working refuge of nunnery. Leona was savvy throughout the book. She made the entire storyline for me. No fool. It's her voice and eyes that form this story.I am glad I read it. The worst aspect was that their middle age was rather condensed and the pacing felt off (almost in total) by their lives' second halves. They were both long-lived in a time where to reach 70 was almost impossible. And often also unseen by the majority of other people (contemporaries) of theirs who were alive at any one point. 50 was VERY old during this period. Women of 46 considered almost like hag throwaways.If you have interest in different Christian sects (I did), this helped with some definitive information but didn't get into the depths I envisioned it would.

And precise regardless of the exploding quality of word count. Which is large and totally cored on the 15 year life of the newly married Duchess of Ferrara. The life story totally through the eyes of Lucrezia, fifth offspring of the Duke and Duchess of Tuscany. Raised within the city of Florence, married away to Ferrara by contract at 13 but not ""delivered"" until 15. The words are as embroidered and opulence crusted as the time and place within her noble's world. 1500's upheavals of treachery and hierarchy yet. And the more that you know about this period for Europe in general, and Italy in particular, the better. You'll get more nuance to the fixtures and paths of reality. Not only for the general knowledge level of humans but for women's lives in this social structure. Infant and childhood death being about 50% or more common. And 50 something years old being ancient. This isn't emphasized but it will help to remember the reality of sickness and infection amongst dozens of other common ""accidents"". It's long and exact as much as it is effusive and natural world embedded. But the subject is going to be too narrow for most readers. Soul-wise, identity wise, manners wise or in sphere of relationship too- this will not be an easy modern read for most to fully dissolve themselves within such length and depths comprehension. I could be wrong, but much doubt it. You need to be extremely patient. And be more than tolerant for the flowery and effusive.There were exquisite 5 star portions- most near the beginning of the book in Lucrezia's early childhood. Most spectacularly with the tiger meeting. But on the long travels and in most of the mid-section half, it was not above 4 star. Certainly for me, not as immersive or throbbing as Hamnet. Still my favorite of hers.Well, this tells you the most dire in the very opening. So a lot of this will play for most readers backwards. But if you need to stop and start your ""Portrait"" read with some longer than usual departures? Still come back. And come back. The whole is worth it. It IS 5 stars for putting ALL into the class and cognition of the era. And although the switching became rather irritating (it did to me)- the years are so close together that that set of ""eyes"" still remains fixed.History records her death from tuberculosis? Why not pick one of the other de Medici's women of several different generations? I truly wonder why Maggie O'Farrell picked this particular daughter.

Dirty work being redefined here from what dirty work meant in the last century. Extremely padded survey of social by products for 5 individuals in their jobs.I need to think about this for a day. That’s how generalized and stereotyped are the fallouts of his work context sensibilities.Later: I want to let you know what his definition of ""dirty work"" is here. For 3/4ths of my life, ""dirty work"" was the following: If you took a shower before work and went to work, it wasn't. If you took a shower AFTER work (often at work) and then went home that was ""dirty work"". And all of us did it too at some point. My Dad and most of the men in my long life did it for decade after decade. Factory, streets and sans., labor construction etc. High rise plastering, working 22nd floor grids etc. You name it, we did it.This is not that ""dirty work"". This is ""dirty work"" in the sense of it causing PTSD or some mental incapacity impacted by its tasks. Something entirely different. So working on an off shore rig would be dangerous and lethal mentally, emotionally etc. Or guarding prisoners, or working the chicken line etc. Or drone pathing.The 5 categories chosen made my jaw drop. In reality. I had to resemble the emoji for that SHOCK to this author's equations of comparisons. So eating chickens becomes equivocated to the Germans' ignoring or allowing camps etc. (Introduction gives you the bottom line of the collective guilt core property examples.) That's the type of category generalizing for guilt laden in repetitive accusatory declarations here. We should all be hanging our heads and taking mood meds for the guilt of appropriating collective or individual warmth or food? These supposedly hidden misery jobs he posits on scales of guilt the rest of us should assume because they exist. On theory par for his German examples of knowledge about human death camps serious.Ironically the two jobs I can think of off the top of my head that ARE giving PTSD routinely, he never mentioned once. Being a soldier (on the front lines and not in front of a computer) or an abortionist.When I was a child we traipsed through the abattoirs at the Chicago Stockyards. I did, three times at least with Girl Scouts or some school trip. I also talked to workers there while they worked -not on a break. My Grandpa worked for Swift. Eyal Press is a name you should remember- it's going to be a ""warning"" label for me. What absurd eyes! And these jobs are ""hidden""? Nope. How would an author or outfit (Eyal Press) judge any life on a farm or anywhere before 1800 by these criteria? Even on this highly subjective level. Irony indeed.

Economies have too many moving parts for these simple / basic summations towards operation and inclusions. This isn't the forum to list all those over simplified tenets here. But one is unemployment as he defines and redefines. There are individuals who chose/choose NOT to work and also some who refuse to work in every living ""gain"" or ownerships definition.

Especially within populations which have always remained small and do their ""proper fit"" into their natural world. Like the aborigine of Australian continent he consistently mentions.

His overall picture gives government itself a much, more altruistic end result that I've ever seen anywhere or even read history concerning. Owners of surplus = bad? Operators of in class government= worse? My observation and history sense- this is often true.Democracy as the answer? Homo sapiens own human nature. His optimal cases give almost no room for the ""elephant"" in the room. That human nature. And as I have seen in my 74 years the very observable decline of knowledge for nearly all aspects of word or symbol or critical thinking learning and common sense survival skills?

It's filled with humor and ""fellows well met"" and stars Rome itself as a marvelous frame placement. EXCELLENT all around. I could picture that actress and the glass window hands. And the Monsignor. And the other tales were at least 4 stars. No losers. One I didn't care for opinions within in but it was still a 4 star tale.

But bottom line is that the read flow jars. Not with the subject matter but within several other composites. Such as skipping to repeats while trying to be chronological. (Trying is the core word on that phrase because this copy only partially succeeds any staying in the chronological.) Often instead it is repeat flashback or flash forward or case or marriage skipping moves again. Another aspect is frequency of tangent going off in highly unrelated directions. The problem is that half case dictates and half autobiography for his life and job? Well the mix is strange for form and flow. The serial killer forensics half was the 4 star parts. Admiring Paul Holes, his writing form! A few more specifics maybe after some thought. Memoirs have a lot of I, me, my in them BUT usually not in such pat myself on the back density.Added later: Paul Holes has personality traits that are verge personality disorder. Just a guess but he goes from mind core logic to emotional roller coasters. It may work for being a criminalist. But it doesn't work well for writing in a detail to events or specific subject matter concentration for more than 7 paragraphs at a time. I would have enjoyed this more if I had not read Michelle Macnamara's ""I'll be gone in the dark"" title. Just reading now that it is soon HBO Max series. Still, Michelle could write and focus. Here Paul Holes has numerous cases and because of all the diversions of interest or courses, this is not more than a 3 star. Especially in the writing flow.I was SO sad to read in this book how Michelle died.. Truly sad. From reading her book, I always got the idea she was physically sick through different comments she made or her referencing to obsessions. And her explaining so much physical lack of mobility etc. And I did know she had died before DeAngelo was arrested. But to know the cause of her death! She should never have been taking those drugs at all.

Some of the plotting was 4.5 stars.Somewhat enjoying her first that was translated, this one I liked even more. I sure hope they translate all the Hanna or any stand alones she does. Yes, there is some switching and voids, but it doesn't stop the flow as much as in other georgraphic placements which have wider cultural contexts and travel. Somehow with all the Swedish close by locals and with the same police team members it all holds together in flow much better than most of the changing narrators scenarios. There are almost too many individuals well carved to remember. That was one of the biggest negatives losing a full star. And on top of it - most were either relatives of each other or work mates or past bff's. So freshen up your Swedish names memory or keep a chart. But, STILL. It was GOOD. There are complex crimes and at least two huge cases that embed throughout. One gets solved. One is left hanging. Please, Johanna Mo, do get the past more cleared with further translations! It appears you have masses that are not in English yet.Flawed WOMEN in this! Yes. We have depressant and also anorexic. Self identity esteem is lacking in both sexes. But the tension and the characters' quirks are mighty and the personality duels just encompass the entire novel length. This was one I returned to eagerly after many busy time interruptions. Which has become rather outlier in fiction piles recently. Putting it down has become easy. But not so much here.Short chapters. Lots of ingenious references to common entertainment culture of the international (Hanna looks like a Game of Thrones character and by description, she does)- Hanna is over 6 feet tall. Some of the happenstance is probably not completely believable for most cultures or more highly populated countries, IMHO. Especially when you consider the outcome with Hugo. Small, small town rural America maybe? But even then, I doubt it.There is no way I guessed the right perp either. Double twists and then a final complete knot. I thought it was another person in the same family.Read the first one first. *Night Singer. It was good. But this one is EXCELLENT. The toad lily garden! I'd love to see it. And Erik's missing his wife and kid! You were almost as glad to see them get off the airplane as he was. This is a short 2 book series (so far) I do recommend.

I went into this older, much earlier published, McEwan without any knowledge. Not even reading the trailer. The only upfront fact I knew was that it held a 1954, 10 years after WWII ending, placement within Berlin.It's a typical McEwan. Fantastic writing of detail and emotional roller coasters. That last quantity especially within the types of quiet mumble mouthed just past coming of age (usually very ENGLISH) men. Here he did Maria in much the same type of clime of precipice hanger. People on the ends of various types of pivotal ""on the edge"" inner landscapes. It is what he is extremely good at doing. But at the 2/3rd spot of the book, the entre sets of duplicitous paths (not at all only for the couple) turns into placement of nightmares. More apt to the type of scenario builds that fit into Horror genre. I didn't see it coming. Although I absolutely much earlier foresaw the future of Maria's and Leonard's outcome as a couple. Correctly.It seems I liked this more than most readers. It was an excellent tale quite beyond just the erotic and burgeoning physical or mental. McEwan also truly encapsulated the precise quandary of English, American, Russian ""allies"" perceptions during this period. Best I have ever read about the American ""shock"" when the Russians turned like the autocrat thugs they can be quite naturally during the Eastern Europe afterwar occupations. It was still like that in 1983 when I went through Berlin into the DDR and eastwards. Americans are STILL surprised or shocked at the quick change in character generally, plus the eventual consequences. Partners or comrades? Not.Well done novel! Loved the time period for ethnic base generalized or specific reality. Blunt, no apology dialogue included. This trait is nearly invisible now unless it is racially cored. There were Blakes everywhere then- not only on that continent either. Still are. More of them now.This is in my top 3 McEwan. Some of his more recent I have not cared for at all.

This one was much better than the only other of hers that I read. Not only did it have an above average premise, but also the personality factors for the 4 or 5 prime characters were carved well. Despite most of the dialogue being hyper over the top. Hannah has an A type adrenaline junkie personality. But her speaking in exclamation points effusive nearly shouting declaratives was not a favorite throughout the first half of the book. Especially within her Glenn, Robby, Taylor etc. work crew. The Houston placements were perfect for this set of people and circumstances as well. Ya-hoo Texas!With the right actors this would make an excellent movie rom.-com. There are plenty of duo conversations which are the meat of that genre. Plus the few actions scenes would be amicable and funny enough for a perfect humor. The type that is almost completely nil from the present day movie scenario. Think an old fashioned 1930's nearly 100 years later cousin similar to Clark Gabel and Claudette Colbert with their sheeted ""walls of Jericho"". Too, too far back for most of you, I know. But maybe like a middle comedic cinema movie twin in the Goldie Hawn variety type; that would work too. You would need the perfect comedic actress that isn't stunning. One in terrific physical shape and not over 5'4"". Like a similar young mid-twenties Sally Field. The actor could be any great looking 6 foot 3"" specimen. But NOT what they consider good looking in this century. Like an Army Ranger type about 6 weeks after ending a 4 year stint. This just missed being fluff and hit the mark.

Better than great. Exactly where I though Eunice belonged.Tyler's religion dissing is comparable to Donna Leon's. And as insightful too. Me thinks they do protest too much. But also totally agree that the older you get, the more apt to love Tyler's quirky, often weird, eccentrics. And the more you understand them as being instead ""naturals"". They are almost never smart either.

And the restaurant itself had to make top notch film fare. In the book, I never felt the restaurant itself was a huge part of ""the stage"" for this family.I would not put this in Tyler's top 5 for me at all. The mother and the children and the invisible for great portions of their lives Beck? It didn't make me feel any more than nervous. Despite the characters of the children, those most especially, being so individually posited and configured.I did think the earliest portion of the Mother's thoughts and memories was an outstanding juxtaposition for the rest of the book. Which was the reality and daily. Quite, quite different than anything the blinded aged mother remembers. Most Tyler books, I do laugh. This one, not so much. Not even for the Ezra up times. Here Tyler draws an early to mid-twentieth century scenario which was almost exact and precise of how overlooks and mores were. Her dialogues are superior.Mostly her quirky people come so close to roosting home. In this one the insular, unable to see anyone's opinion but her own, vastly chip on the shoulder mother comes into full center stage. I'm rather outlier on this book.

Only a couple of these kept it back. 4.5 stars for short stories? I must have gone bonkers.Short reaction tomorrow. Love the varying time periods also.Later: This author writes ordinary people well. Gets carved characterizations within just a few pages. Not by telling but by showing, exposing, dialogues. The first story, Mansard and the last one were the ones which kept me going all the way to a 5 star rating. The first was too long and eek! The last was a writer writing about writing- a subject I disdain in both the wide and in the narrow. She sticks that into other stories too like Timeline's quote aside re her thought about words- ""If you put a few of them in the right order a three-minute story about a girl and her dog can get people to forget all the ways you've disappointed them.""I really like the international touches of narrator or placements. Also loved the Waiting for Charlie as it is a subject very, very rarely visited. And seldom done so well. And each decade of story occurrence (most are pre 2000) has the totally correct ambiance too. In 2022 this has become for ""new"" publications rarer then the cliched hens' teeth. Majority fiction holding era contexts that are pure 2010 plus sensibilities. Or revised mores and material substances on top of it.She has a close similarity to Anne Tyler's treatments of the quirky, eccentric, feisty teen, or lonely oddball middle aged ordinary folks. And they come quickly fully blown in nature and in recognition as deeply. She does savvy elders as well as Elizabeth Strout.

It was the only one available and I got full attention by the hardcover design.This is a book I could easily put into the Literature with the big L category. The poetry, the leading to each chapter quotes from antiquity to nearly modern times! That with adding the juxtaposition for all of Billy's (Henry's) different ages and periods of time in that Southwest territory or Mexico! (All scrambled for/ in priority to their overall long term fallouts?) Just a stupendous setting for the surrounds of ""the Kid"" in all of his various aspects. And in this presentation ""the Kid"" was mighty. Nearly everyman. Lover, killer, book reader, composer, thief, dancer, animal owner and protector of and for all things corporal or loved/desired. All things.This is fiction. But what an ""if Garrett again blasted the wrong man"" composite for imagination. Which reality or which legend? Oh the legends!And the women in this cut to their core emotional and physical treatises. Because that is what this is. Life or death in the minute or the month or that year core to survive and BE human. Manuela, Cesla, Isabella, Susanne- all the loves and lovers of years or moments were characterized down to their areola tints. But beyond all that of Henry (Billy the Kid's real name) - there is the stinging Garden of Stones cemetery of the Wild West. Read the crooked sticks of carved names which tell the story. Tom, Charlie, infant, infant, infant. Dozens lying on the bend of the Pecos.Really, really opens your eyes to the when the West was not only lawless but what friendship entailed in that period. Or even structures of town or mound.This reads like poetry. I seldom appreciate poetry. But I do appreciation when speechifying or tales get the flow and sounds of a Shakespeare adventure. (And some of these quotes are aptly his.)Very much recommend. Yes, it is brutal. And I can picture Henry in great age very easily.OMG, can this guy write. I will read more of his for sure.Too many excellent quotes to list but just a few:""Kingly confines stern and cold where blood and guilt is bought and sold"" - Shelley""I do not see them here; but after death God knows I know the faces I shall see. Each one a murdered self, with low last breath.""- Dante Rossetti""To withdraw is not to run away, and to stay is no wise action. When there's more reason to fear than to hope."" - Cervantes""For you and I are past our dancing days.""- ShakespeareSo glad I picked this one serendipity.

But I also find it interesting that when there is a death in Tyler it is always not money much connected to lifestyle. Always a trust or someone else who picks up the household $$$ when a spouse dies. Not in real life at all. No connection there.Oh this brought back memories of my Denise and Ben. Long gone and much missed.I LOVED the way Willa skirted almost all conflict resolutions disagreements (fights). Not only about any work or leisure time choices either. She learned it early.

It was hard for me to read the last two stories. What came before was too depleting. I actually took a break for a few days over a very busy weekend. That did help. The story about climbing the work Cranes made me even sadder after the time lapse though. Young have got to have this type of nihilist attitude?

The only surprise I got was re the ""deluded"" Sirocco - her role and her placement identity. Pete? He was absolutely not doing what he plied to be connecting either. He did not surprise me whatsoever. And Hamish? Such a unreliable anything that none of his story was believable within any contexts of partners. Well, the forms were excellent. That's what made me go to 4 stars. And in comparing to other books this middle of this novel (the middle 125 pages out of nearly 400) were GREAT. Nearly 5 stars. The play with letters and travel etc. The mix was a ""can't put it down"" pace and also dicey. There have NOT been many good middles in recent 100 reads. Good beginnings galore, and some great endings- yet the middles filled with telling and telling tripe. This was the opposite.She is a writer that holds word craft but also can juxtapose (for switches and for plotting) without being descriptive verbose or telling, telling overload. I MUCH admire that quality. She shows by context and the characters themselves reveal or not. And as such copy- Sharon Bolton does not suffer fools. I will read more for sure.

But at the same time SO many of the town's citizens, their moral relativity, their structures, their belief systems, their faith and authority measures- all of that? And they definitely are prime to this entire justice situation. Well, the author panders in a kind of half respectful, yet half arrogant type of base definitive conclusive ""telling"". He certainly does not know as much as he thinks he does about the LDS Church or belief system, either. Certainly within the victim shaming aspects of forgiving/retributions- those especially.Regardless, I almost considered giving this a 2 stars. Lots of discriminate judging going on between all sides of this case. The man was guilty, but societal oppositions were far, far beyond just the doctor problem in this town. As were the mores. And I don't believe with all this length, that the base differences of mix was posited in the correct light of what religion, faith, core values, directive action of charity etc. MEAN to the vast number of people being parsed here.So I gave it a 3 stars.

Well, that's not a given at all. It happened within a huge university in the Midwest and for Olympics coaches/ docs.

Truly early Stephen King creepy. Not only creepy but devious and sinister also.Then the switching got too too. And after the half way point the actual detail and sequences got more than unrealistic, almost absurd. Children to authority to the perp and the past?

And the condition of Teresa all by itself was ALMOST up to the bar of being impossible for that time and place, as well.Not even in a remote Alpine town could such a physical and mental state WOMAN in Italian hierarchies be so enabled to continue the job the way she did. Not happening. Probably not for a man either. Police cannot risk the danger to all the other officers with fainting and voids going on like that.

For instance, the ""loop"" system window description on the trip back to NYC with Nadine. There were surround or component pieces just like that which were added, not essential, but rather entertaining to imagine. And they occurred throughout this novel. Seldom do I read any s before I read a book. This was one of the exceptions. Primarily because I anticipated PLENTY and also because I had to wait for some time after others had already read it. OK, it wasn't as good as Dark Matter. But this one held more actual chemistry, biology, other sciences of math etc. Some of the posits HIGHLY interesting too. Homo sapiens' knowledge or emotional components not the least. And the tales humans told/tell or succor systems voiced to encompass our own temporary states or suffering or fears. But it brought to mind over and over again the basic ""disobedience"" as a whole when too much knowledge is accessed by any ""tree of knowledge"" so to speak. And I did think this entire plot, premise etc. did take a major cop out on that bigger picture entirely. Compassion and empathy is feeling. It rarely solves and almost definitely doesn't help because it far more often enables instead. It's a recipe for dependency. Not the good kind either. Well, the ending was immensely flawed. Not our species or reality of human outcomes. Neither. Crocodile tears! Starving, death, suffering would continue. Possibly increased. Still the ride along with our altered hero was worth taking. So much sped up action that a good movie (expensive sets) would be doable. And the placements were excellent too. Montana and Colorado especially apt. Others complain of a lesser last third. And liked the first half much better. That wasn't my take on this one much. And other than the DNA helix imbedded code (code breaking skills gone superlative) that their mother Miriam used- I didn't think that the science was difficult to comprehend at all after the 50% mark. Just less easy read interpersonal as with the Ava chess or wife or coworker etc. first half scenes. All the science measurements and testing values named will also make some peoples' eyes glace over. As will his Logan's intense thinking knowledge of muscle groups or injury descriptions etc. Ok, Logan knows all that. Most readers won't want to. And it definitely does not make him altruistic or ""good"" at core in that KNOWLEGE either.Well, Crouch does have imagination. But also inaccurate and huge jumps in logic were demonstrated in this book. No system of vastly upgraded human around the Earth as it was before, is now or will be in the future- would ""solve"" at all, IMHO. Instead all the perceptions expanded as would be all the crimes, faults, short cuts etc.? Not a fan of any result that would or could occur. The upgrades already established certainly did not make them saints in deaths or in any of the outcomes. Quite the opposite. Government and elites would decimate MORE, not less. Work, production of any type? Think about it. Robots or machines would never fill the gaps. A recipe for a faster homo end, IMHO. Not a saving of one.Overall, this was not the top rung premise that most readers express or react to here. There were all kinds of sidecar issues never fully approached within this book for making these evolutionary changes so instantly. Emotional aspects of 1000 degrees too I could list. Loyalty, trust, love. They all don't depend at all on supreme knowledge or sensory inputs of maximum degree nor component physicality. Nor would this upgrade improve capacity for ""goodness"", IMHO. Some of the science seemed off to me too. But it still made a good bunch of interaction sequences regardless. Like in those stairwells to the 36th floor.So an extra half star for composite of some HUGE human components. Not on much other than the brain or physical outlays. Which should actually be minus 2 stars if I was purely honest and wasn't so entertained by his imaginative nasties. Because the human homo sapiens or homo deux or whatever would STILL be flawed.

But this one I loved. Probably in her top three I've enjoyed, despite having read about half of her output. Which is considerable.Abby is a typical Tyler character. She's unusual, if not eccentric, and has much in common with several other Tyler women in other books. A wife and a mother being her life, but not really. An essential type of individualism in disconnection which overlooks and embeds without getting either blame or praise attached. Rather rare. Not smart as a whip, and also not deep. Very much in the minute without any owning angst to outcomes. Love Tyler women. Have known a few like that, and yet in this age- NONE. Abby here forgives and forgets immediately. But registers. Not anything like the ancient history payback people or suspicious or selfish manipulators. Quite the opposite in both aspects.The form of the book was not a favorite though. It was nearly in reverse order. Part I was nearly half the book and my favorite by far. Abby's family. The Beach week segment was priceless. But Part II and Part III and follow ups became shorter in each sequence and were mostly flashback and many years prior to Part I. You heard the ancestor, youth, past birth family tales all centered upon the Brill House. Which in great decades of time became the Whitshanks' home.Now after these many Tyler books I am beginning to see a real pattern. She almost in every case has a man, a son usually- who is a never do well. Spiteful, sensitive to every life hurt possible, unwilling to develop maturity in work or in most normal life courses etc. Usually he is a good person to her, the Mom. Not always. But usually too a pain in the ass to everyone else in the family. Or a user- a guest that comes and goes but always in some kind of fugue to everyone else's wants/needs except to where he, himself, stands. And he is almost always a huge manipulator too. Economically and mentally. Tyler must really have had massive personal life context with this real deal. She had two daughters and no son, but there was someone in the picture. Grandson, nephew or whatever. She lived experience.She also gets women as individuals. Her marriage savvy non-withstanding. But her core women are nearly always not smart but at the edge of naivety. Open handed to the extreme while even putting themselves at risk. She makes some eccentric. Detached too. Almost ethereal. With their attentions in the clouds. She makes some of her men like that to SOME extent too. The mild ones she does. But most of her books have true oddballs in at least 1/2 the chapters. Surrounded by the ""normal"" who almost always pick up all the slack. Anne Tyler does notice.These are Baltimore working class everyday people. Ordinary. Just exactly like the world I knew for the first half of my life, maybe more. At least 35-40 years. Land lines are still ringing (and you know who it might be and need to get to it fast) and men are everywhere who know how to fix nearly everything. Neighborhood doors are almost always open to more than just 10 or 20 people too. And do you know it. Also never unusual to have 2 or 3 extra for dinner. It's almost gone in 2022. I liked the funeral service in this book immensely too. I have been to at least 5 to 10 of these in the last 4 years alone. People who didn't really go to Church. Let me tell you, their funerals can truly be a window. Here the Whitshanks did well. No religion at all funeral memorials are absolutely the most pathetic gatherings I've ever witnessed. Here Amanda, Jeannie, Stem, and Denny managed very well considering the circumstances and the fervor of the deceased.Some of the descriptions in this book are in her best ever category. I love the Swedish Blue context and also ""stuff"" like a clothes quip that it was the blue of the Noxzema jar. She has tons of those excellent USA colloquialisms in there.Most readers without any age on them will probably think this book boring. I nearly gave it a 5 stars. Great family perusal.

Superlative and this is entirely a 5 star experience of character, influence, mode of behaviors, personality persona exhibited, and the HUGE influence she made as teacher and mentor to the mid-30's of age Julian Barnes. He LOVES her mind beyond even his own ability to form prose of flow and consequence.Part 2 is the treatise of belief posited. It plays out within the arguments from all these names of authors and lives (dozens and dozens of quotes superior) of antiquity and historic past which Elizabeth left him (willed by designation) in her notes/ papers. This received years later after Elizabeth suffered an earlier than expected cancer death. This part will make most readers eyes roll up in their head. It IS a treatise for a solid argument that Julian the Apostate's victory would have changed the entire course of homo sapiens history for the predominance of Christianity in monotheistic dominate power for the next millenia.

Not even the ones where joy or happiness are anywhere near the top ""to be attained"" prizes for men and women humans. And I disagree about Elizabeth too here though. Julian deemed her optimist side. To me she was more a Stoic-pessimist than a Stoic-optimist.Then there is Part 3 (yes, and the book is quite short but says a WHOLE LOT for its length). And this is where it lost the star for me. This part should have been even shorter. He goes too far into the Julian Barnes self-adoration side sanctuary instead of staying in the body of the cathedral, so to speak. He adores himself. He is brilliant. And does he know it. Part 3 is a later in life (Julian Barnes life) summation of the ""worths"" from his incredible Elizabeth Finch friendship and example memory. (I do know worths is not a word but it should be.) And also FURTHER proofs for Julian the Apostate being in the right channel within the human species river stream. Having ""the know"" far more correctly than religious faith or any other human ""mindset"" baseline since. (But he fails to finish this argument, IMHO. Because Julian the Emperor was sober, not a glutton, not addicted to power or clothes or lodgings of wealth etc. etc. etc.- in fact nearly a unshaven peasant in appearance and habits.) Here I could go long. Most men do not have the aptitudes, IQ or temperament base of a Julian our last Emperor.This is for the philosophers among you. I thought it a 5 star completely until the last 15 pages. But more than 4.5 stars in total. If you have ever read treatises for part of your living, you MIGHT begin to appreciate what he did here. Most people will give this 2 stars or a bit more for the Part 1.But most people have almost no understanding of the human mind or the soul. And have not been exposed to these TRULY FREE SPEECH means to acquire an individual belief or action or speech mode that is made of well thought purpose for individual seeking. If they did outcomes would be different than they are in 2022. Nearly everywhere. Hedonism's opposite is principled thinking as this was. We have mere squabbles of humans never taught to think amid living hedonism now. And that chaos is getting worse.This is Julian Barnes' love letter to the teachers and people who taught us ""how to think"" and not ""what to think"". Most people today don't even have an inkling for the difference.-""To be a stoic in an age of self-pity is to be judged standoffish, worse, unfeeling.""-""And there are many others who confuse feeling guilty with being absolved. They are less aware that there are stages in between."" -""A woman described herself recently as 'preternaturally truthful'. Which is melodramatic nonsense. There are not degrees of truthfulness. There are degrees of lying, but that is another matter.""Elizabeth Finch ALWAYS warns about pity. There are many pity cored quotes. BEWARE which fits 2000 plus eras PERFECTLY. Empathy and pity have viscous backsides. And useless faces....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Aug 17, 2022","Aug 19, 2022","May 23, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59900690-elizabeth-finch

The story covers the next couple of decades plus.Detail was extensive for the periods and most of the historical aspect of copy. And without any exceptions the entire novel is also very representative for the woman's read supreme of the time. In many aspects it remained me of The Group. Or other sexual couplings effusive tracts mixed with attempts at literary or arts appreciation that was a HUGE percentage of paperback fodder of the period between 1965-1990 especially. I read so many of these.Even when young or middle aged and this was ""new""- I would never have given it more than 3 stars.Knowing so many Vietnam soldiers, officers too. One very well, in fact. Well, this didn't truly do the Army itself or the Vietnam crux situations to any extent beyond the soap opera angles. Joanna especially. Not a norm. How many other officers did she end up sleeping with? And Adam?He would have never made it out of West Point. Attitudes and voicing DO matter.But it was a melodramatic and extremely poignant tale told. And exactly what women would read. It was like an elongated version of Redbook stories. If you read Redbook back in the day- you know what I mean. Romance like the Joanna/Adam mix of star crossed lovers was always at some point in the postures there. Or being ""modern"" and eventually falling into illicit love affairs regardless of the conscience posit. Joanna's Catholic thought patterns and daily Mass etc. etc. etc. That was so overdone and virtually ridiculous. Women who I knew as close friends who become nuns and 200 others in some of my huge h.S. classes? Never that close minded, restricted, or in anyway that naive before marriage most especially. But the mix was truly retro for the period. And the characters were absolutely individual and their paths status quo for their era. These women would be only about 10 years older than I. Or less. Korea, Vietnam was handled at just about a 3 star level, as well.Added later as I forgot to note this fairly core point. I did read this when it was ""new"". And I did remember the Joanna character but almost nothing else. But knowing so many long married Army or Armed Forces people in real life situations, I didn't at all relate that much as others say they did when they were young to this read. I knew then as I know now, being married for 40 or 50 years does NOT imply that the people are happy people. Or well suited either.

But you never get the sense of real, critical showdowns or changes to base power structures of ruling much of the details for all that head to head. Not at all. IMHO, you also don't get the extent of the gruesome annihilations and destruction much either. Not to the viscous and lethal death sentences handed out. Far beyond just the Romanov's or nobles straight out executed. Cruelty beyond imaging as givens too.Photos were excellent. To me, the man nearly almost always appears very sick. His older brother Alexander did not. The family dynamic to me was super, super strange too. And having Alexander get hanged? Probably just about buried any sense of empathetic fairness or individuality justice Lenin ever did have. More than just my own opinion.Obsessed with politico from childhood, that's for sure.

REAL PEOPLE.I've liked all of hers but this one is near the top. Mercy was intriguing. One of the best characters I've read in years. I will not forget her.

Not embedded in the minutia and every emotional whim and direction of their children's lives. Either of them. Most parents of every type of human used to be and were in their era- similar (never identical in quirks or voids either at the same time). They knew they didn't ""own"" their kids. That's not what I observe today much at all. Those people in French Braid are the closest to/of any to the neighborhoods I lived in the 1950's, 1960's, 1970's. These I find I can connect to them the most in any fiction I read in several years. Most too, in my world, were members of 8 to 12 kid families. All individuals, yet all differing in aptness and direction too- just like this. And also I do realize something else. That I love so much in great majority the people who author modern genre and who also happen to come from Minnesota. It's not an accident that they see individual difference sublimely. Nor normal. Nor don't harbor huge long term emotive burdens.Love has many, many faces. And plays out entirely differently with cultural ""good"", individual, likes and dislikes of everyday mix. That's the truth.

The change was not only in the monarch's conceptions of themselves, but where the moral, economic, law authority began or ended. And if the role in nation was on a par to family or even personal choice human. Tillyard does an excellent job in research. The Introduction is one of the best for this type of copy I've ever read. Why I read it was because I am more than average interested in how different European or Asian monarchs were often so attitude or eyes of observation colored nearly completely by their childhoods. Were they in isolation (like Victoria) or were they set apart from even their birth families (too many to list) or were they set into much reduced households of 4 or 5 or 8 siblings (happened just like this George III quite a bit too). When the son dies before the father, and the grandson or granddaughter reign from youth- the outcomes are so very much altered by the early years living arrangements and/or the ties fact of residing WITH or closely adjacent to a living mother (not always Queen either, in this case the Princess of Wales only). And also being surrounded by numerous siblings.George III was absolutely a product of all of his early years. Read the book. He thought himself the authority to his sister and her outcomes (family duty widened) as well. This is the story of the youngest sister and her attempt as Queen of Denmark to change societal rules/outlook and individuality as humane. One of the first quirks of humanist as opposed to strict moral codes.This will not be a book for everyone. But for me it was a tremendous window into the making of a man who lost North American colonies and enabled the Revolution to succeed. His view was limited by the right/wrong scales he held.

Both the sentence structures and the introductions of multiple, multiple characters at different life ages? Confusing, and at times conflated any ""knowing"" of them because of the various eyes or interactions of that period of their life. The men were treated this way throughout the book entire. Over, over described in very similar pandering phrases and the people are not ""known"" to me at the same time. Especially Matelda and her granddaughter. UGH!I should have stopped this one near the beginning when she was phone absorbed while visiting her Grandmother. I would love to hear from my Mother how she would feel about this book. Her Sicilian would come out on these moderns big time and I bet she would say. ""They are crying with a loaf of bread under each arm."" But she was smarter than I am. She would probably have stopped this one at about page 60.Lastly and yet I have said this 4 times at least in the last 2 years; family sagas should never be put into switching time periods and narrators. The more generations the worse the interpretations. Think Pachinko- the same exact problem. Most especially in this tome length case, the modern characters are always done the worst- like fodder aftermath.

Well, context is usually difficult to connect to all she states in this book.Regardless, the methods and the isolation with that repeating and repeating. Torture plus which makes water boarding look like child's play, IMHO. And so much fate unknown. And always on the job insipid replacements of Han for Uyghur. All of that. It reminds me of the worst aspects of racist affirmative action to me. Yes it does. And I don't care if that's not a popular opinion. Jobs filled with criteria of the tribal shade or race or ethnic group or gender or whatever apart from the true abilities and measures of practical applications abilities of the humans for those jobs. The Chinese government and stated purposes seem to have genocide affirmed right in the same class, if not worse, than other genocides of the last century. Nazi's or Turk's with the Armenians or whatever- the only different is that they killed quicker. The outcomes here are worse in duration and in outcomes, IMHO. It's hard to imagine how that is possible, but it is.But somethings I just don't understand here about her particular journey. Especially how she can put the remaining Uyghur relatives in her hometowns at such risk. I couldn't do it. Speaking out isn't just brave for yourself and your own group in France- but what about the ones behind! They are toast. Worse. It means 2 or 3 years of torture, starvation, slow death and being dumped in the large desert wastes eventually.Lots of implications in her tale that I also find quizzical.

Both I think.First of all these are very savvy and punctured people. Living through lifetimes of being full boat annihilated and all their goods, homes, cultural mores, religion being taken away from them by government. And usually not even able to speak their own languages in schools or any public forum. Starvation merely one of the sidebars.So this book being entwined with a romance? And also the form itself. The dialogue was YA. Telling and telling too. Not showing. And few populations could be farther removed from both of those habits. Not in real life. Or any reality I've seen them live. Nor any I have loved or have seen departed early from the aftermaths. Strong people. Absolutely melded like metal by pure persecution and adversity. None of the characters in this book, not a one- came alive to me either. All the steel and crazy vivaciousness (what else can they do to us moxie) is missing. They are almost monotonous instead.There were some aspects that were spot on. Like teaching 2nd and 3rd generation their language. But nearly all else was pure fiction in both a form and melodrama sense of sentimentality for the Illinois narratives. TRUTHFULLY, almost all sentimentality has been sunk nearly completely in these survivors. And they drink alcohol. ALL.So that's why I pondered for an entire day. Perhaps my reality for these humans has distorted my ""taste"". But no, I think not there too. Switching like this with so much being taken out of the drift and even more ""telling"" intros? Not a style and not the writing this situation at all deserves. Also there is something that makes my skin crawl whenever a situational dialogue within any genocide takes a sweetish or melancholy main mood. As when they tell about tailors or musical instrument players in death camps kind of thing.

You need to read it. And its depth. I do remember rushing to throw up when a film of Kinsey experimental techniques on young children, mostly boys- was shown to my group during a graduate Psych. class back in the 1990's. Beyond sick. Beyond child abuse. The aim in the first 100 years was to break down all shame, primarily. And the history of those who developed these fields is pure projection because of their own sexual proclivities or intentions. Even the natural response to children- which is to cover themselves automatically in group nude situations; it is core stated to break that down. Step one only. This literally makes me nauseous.The people who gave this 1 star did not read the book. It's mostly history and exact events- the papers and organized groups' histories which have resulted in the present state of no WOMAN definition becoming possible. Not even for most doctors when asked. Name calling is the usual response to any of these questions or suppositions arising from the current practices on this subject too. It is demonstrated here profusely on Goodreads. It's first onus was for the pedophilia core. It was from the first 1800 something definitions. And also to negate all religions and their influences. That was and is now central focus to the organizational subcultures, as well. Hedonism and entire life sexual alive appetite twinned. The only biggest sin being celibacy. This is not a book I would recommend for the weak stomached or common good intent majority of heart. Either. The reality right now in schools and the exact graphics put in books to kids who don't even know yet how to read! The mantra is the more the better and the earlier the best. Across the boards too. Especially in the teaching crafts coming out of the most prestigious international (not just USA) institutions of ""higher"" learning. This is not a rant by Matt Walsh. It is mainly history of people and events. And the results. There are too many quotes from too many truly wise to include in the  or my reaction. But read this if you have the will to be a witness. And can truly understand how the very core and heart of human behaviors can be redefined into paths that are almost entirely the opposite of the normal human. Or even a healthy human.One quote from the World League for Sexual Reform (one of the first back in the latest 1800's and founded in Berlin Germany)- ""application of the knowledge of Eugenics towards improvement of the race through Birth Selection."" ""proper, scientific understanding of the variations in sexual constitutions (intersexuality)"" and to free sex from being ""complicated by any sense of guilt.""""To put it succinctly, the League wanted to overturn traditional ideas of sexual morality, marriage, and the relationship between men and women."" And it got much worse after that- to even interpreting Bible or other past records into definitions that they never, ever held. Not even in nuance or any sense of cognition to same.But this is also an excellent logic or philosophy question. What he asks, and what answers he gets when he asks them. It is the exact function that is described in the title. Matt Walsh gets answers- but most of them hold nothing but evasion. And immense ignorance.We have come to the point of having to ask IF humans who want a limb amputation can be accommodated. And most doctors will no longer answer that one either.

How could this amount of money be spent on these police, courts, medical etc. services on this case for 5 years plus and STILL get it so wrong.Hard to believe.The other aspect that struck me about the repetitions in reading witness testimony and in the author's tangents of information (masses of it)- is that these people (every one of them) lead such loose as a goose lives- that it wasn't only the violence involved. The numbers of affairs and the various tall tales associated! Betsy herself. What a dichotomy of directions while going for end stage chemotherapy. Very, very strange. Very outlier.

In 1983 I and my parents and one cousin and aunt took an extended trip to Europe and in the main lengths of time to Germany. It was for the Passion Play but my Father, Mother and I took an extended trip through the DDR. Several reasons to do it. We spent time in Leipzig and within other areas Westerners and especially Americans rarely had gone for over 25 years. Until that time I did not truly understand the divisions and that Berlin itself as a city was located deep within the DDR (Eastern Germany) under Russian control. So passing as Checkpoint Charlie in the city to the American sector (we did) still left you only those square miles. The entire city was surrounded by East Germany. STILL In our case it was a multi hour bus ride with papers being checked at intervals. Stop, they get on, check your papers, get off. Make you wait another 10 minutes. Tell you to go. Americans do not get that in majority. They thought/ think you went ""over or under the wall"" and you were in Western Germany proper. Safe. No. You were still a long drive to anywhere outside of the DDR. Your embassy help? Your passage from those permissible to travel? All still very much a dubious prospect.So this book, with all the levels of being watched and watching. All the entry and exits eyes. All the meals with beets as the main course or wanting to take/ exchange your foodstuffs or jeans instead of cash money. All the lack of color and lack of smiles. All the collapsing structures and windows boarded or boxed in. All the people staring at your clothes. All the doors with bricks used as locks. All of it- reading it and seeing it through these eyes (even Peter's)- was sure a 5 star reading experience. Or 6 stars. I remember them well. I could go super long on the plot and the contributing constant associations of necessity for the power/ knowledge/ economics of this spying life- but I won't. Read it. It was 20 years after this book's time (1963) that I was there but all was still extremely similar. Especially in the duo soldiers who looked about 15 years old following us around all days with their rifles. (Long guns, I am not kidding). Everywhere we went. And everywhere we did go had to be plotted out and told before hand with accompany criteria of actions described. In 1983 there was NOTHING that even held a true coat of paint anymore in the structural. It was like a black and white movie in true life. With your papers out constantly. Cars appeared like rusted little boxes looking more beat up than golf carts in an after accident pile.So I do understand the incredible duplicity of these characters and their often ridiculous and true believer idealisms, as well. Especially those last features of ""mutti"" here. Sick and beyond. And what it takes to have such acting ability as Martin had in this one.Superb choices by the author of using looks for worded language here too. That was SO real as it was lived. Joseph Kanon truly can write reality. He absolutely does not suffer fools.If he has others, I will read them.

It's truly hard to envision how he could get away with all he did. Many murders and not a real one of them any accident. The remaining portions were not even 3 stars. 2.5 stars at the most. And there was a couple of huge problems (for me anyway) about this book in general and about the last sections re Harper Lee and also the aftermaths of this murderer and also Capote friendship and the times she lived in Manhattan, NYC. The bigger one was the continuity factor, but the egregious aspect glaringly and nearly constant was the author's interpretations as well. Not only on any politico or judgmental criteria about the writers or elites of the trial etc. either. So many assumptions and determinations that were distant from non-fiction. Also verbiage verbose. And the lawyer biography section was huge and almost, for me, filler. As were the long histories and lengthy progressions of the development of life insurance itself. Yet all the photos were excellent- at least 4 stars to set the political race etc.Harper Lee was in her life, outcomes over long periods of time and many relationships- truly sad. To what extent and for numerous mood and perception factors, it did portray the long term breakdown. As opposed to most ers of this book I do read non-fiction. Not primarily but nearly in a 1 to 2 pattern with fiction. This was not anywhere near the best non-fiction category for any year. Since about 2010, at least, there have been numerous top notch non-fiction books published in nearly every classification. Some even upon the historical or natural history etc.I definitely understand why she never wrote about this particular trial as she had planned to do. Few situations and trials could have been more discordant with the feeling or the philosophy of her famous book. From murdered to murderer it was much more the stuff of greed, hateful, gang banger habits fodder. There were NO mockingbirds in this picture whatsoever.

Blizzard today and beyond that this book is heart spearing.I'll read #1 if I can find it. It taught me difference between signature and MO category.So here it is, my reaction. Douglas will be an author (I find he has multitudes) that I read in the future.This was divided into parts and chronological. There is also quite a bit of FBI hierarchy and history for three or four service officers that may be ""boring"" for some readers. But this is from their beginnings of being entrenched to profiling as a whole- so I thought it was well worth the read.There is a letter than the victim wrote her family just minutes before the murderer (beyond evil) killed her. That is just soul wrenching. This girl was 17 and the very next day was her graduation from high school. She was to sing the Anthem. And she was due to leave on a Bahamas trip in two days for a week after that. And she KNEW her life was over within just a few hours of being abducted by her own mail box. He LOVED the control he was operating by ordering her to write them a goodbye letter. I cried. It's just beyond explanation what she wrote. Like a martyr. Honestly, if you read the psychological cognitions that can be ascertained from the signature or MO paths the killer repeats! That alone is worth this read. This man did the same to a 9 year old just a couple of weeks later. He was let out of prison and rehab places (mental health) at least 5 times before these events. He also can be assumed to have killed at least 4 more that are all still open cases, but that fit time/place and pattern of expanding activity. He received the death penalty after years and years of appeals. He absolutely deserved it. Electric chair and he got to pick his own method. He was an electrician by trade and could have had lethal injection.Right now they are letting out multiples of this perp's horror deeds again. They are. It is denied by the know betters. But such as he ARE being freed. Some after 25 years in IL. And they commit again. Most of these psychological states have no cures. NONE.This South Carolina tale is very, very close to one that happened in IL within the same period. I knew one of those nurses who was killed. Won't say the name. This Part I made me cry. Her family is far beyond the reaction long term that I would have had. Advice: Fight. It's better to be killed immediately than be dragged into a vehicle. And that I do know about first hand. Scars will heal. The ride you take won't have a good ending. Most of the worst killers will not shoot or stab if in a public place.

I believe the personality carving is well done but in print? People with this type of petty and frankly narrow world views and lack of action or whatever you would call such morose or limited range of lifestyle? Her books are soap operas of depth to minutia lives. Mostly on social or family or society small groups' schemes and intersects. This one was a decent tale and actually more interesting than most soap opera tales for me, but also extremely bloated in past flashback memory or some other type of redundancy to the same exact event, issue, argument reaction etc. You could add etc. etc. etc.Every family member was super known by the end of the first quarter of the book. So endless rehashing and rehashing truly wasn't needed. I believe she writes for drama sales to film scripts usages. This is series stuff- not really just a single novel. Big Little Lies was too. And several others. Two were so boring and modern angst prone in repeat scopes that I made them DNF. Her work has a limit of 1 a year for me. Maybe now- 1 every 2 years or if over 330 pages- ignore territory. She knows folks. And she has a way with words to place in time periods more than adequately. Rare in the moderns, IMHO. She knows older people but can't really understand or think like they do yet. And her 30 or 40 somethings are always the most accurately parceled. Most of which are singles selfish prime and hold anxiety, self-identity issues that are so much the focus of current fiction. Novels about the hapless and helpless predominant. With tons of lying and manipulative deception for the ""normal"" individual.They sell. They make good series dialogue and once in awhile keep you guessing. Readers today, especially the younger under 40- they seem to love that druthers territory. She nitwits details of exact time periods to a 5 star though. For instance her stating here that no one writes checks anymore. Two times in the last 5 months I have viewed and participated in arguments about this. The state of IL charges you for any type of transfers for licenses or other dozens of their taxes and fees. $2.50 a crack yet. And youngest don't understand why they never have any savings or where the money all goes. Argument about a party gift too recently. Someone needs to clue in moderns to some basic forms of etiquette? But I am most probably finished with reading this author. Too much gossip and self analysis within each character for me. Petty, immature, crabby features especially. I kept to the end with this one only because I had to stop for blizzard clean ups and broke it down into many shorter reads. I know quite a few long married Joys. I knew which way the ending would go at about the 3/4ths point. Husbands who walk away are not very often the other kind. No spoilers.Not liking tennis- I truly am surprised this kept me until the end, though. But sport parents are all quite like this. So are music parents. I have a cousin who has lived all of his almost 85 years with all of his 8 kids doing almost nothing but band, orchestra and still doing gigs downtown. Nothing else. One of my grandsons is orchestra trapped too.Regardless, this was a chore all told. I think her skill is 4 stars for people knowledge but most of their lives are such mundane fodder that I just couldn't read another. All long marriages have immense compromises, IMHO. Also long term relationships of any kind do. And that chip on the shoulder from some past action or history or being continually hurt in your ""victim"" state as a good thing for going forward? It's the habit now to consider that worthy . It's eternal self-pollution. All long timers of any near to joyful (OR JOY HERE) have to turn a page. Once a month or two at least. And develop some strong forgetfulness about past wrongs.So that's probably why I finished it.

Well, I have never read a Bridgerton, never out of hand do I pick Romance as a preferred genre category or do I particularly like the exact period of these early 1800's class in England.

But after deciding and pondering for a day, despite the variances for the distinct time periods (subtle chances in more than just the Stella/Violet relationship or job courses)- and the various repetitions in their language bicker?

Because this is only one of 3 or 4 modern and also in this particular genre of fiction novels that I feel did the in depth love/hate or forever tied to psyches relationship- WELL.

But most of those hold very little of the actual residing, living habits for scores of holidays, working daily by the hour details so fully developed long term life friendship as this one did.It certainly is not Literature with the big L, nor is it glib enough for the fast paced or savage grit crowd to follow. But this one is truly memorable. And I enjoyed and was perplexed and then surprised and then informed- all at different times. Because it's truly not simple- relationships that fall in these patterns. I've seen them in my own life during various very differing ages too. Success. In my youth in an exceptional private school, Violet's course; it was called social climbing. And it was observable. And many held it worthy. And some truly did make it work for huge and long term successes. Not only within economics either. Also a place too of all girls growing to womanhood.So for me, this book resounded. For some reason this type of beauteous appearance and cherished for popularity circles and cycles have always found me on the outside. Even when I was welcomed. There is just too much pretending and artifice for simple and blunt small brown haired girls like me. If you ever went to an all girls boarding, h.s. or college. You might like this one. Or if you have been in extremely competitive fields of music, arts, entertainment, sales, etc. Or college or grad school university paths where 20 apply and 1 gets intro.BTW, I strongly disagree with some of the generalities and assumptions made by this book's narrator. In politics, in ""the rich"" descriptions etc. and/ or of universal instant path connections too.

Written more than 20 years ago- it is within books just like this that I presently miss the most in this genre most especially. This doesn't suffer fools.

In a land where the caste system and suttee has been / is traditional. And where specific tribal morality is relative to a very shifting scale of what we would or might call recompense on other continents. Or others just plain calling it revenge. Or for others- it is merely balancing ""the karma"". This was a terrific example. No more so than within this period, all these years later when relative morality is rife with opposites of conditions and actions for what is deemed ""good"" behavior. Both in crimes and in daily actions at that. Up is down and down has become up.I might have read one of these latter books of the series? I will rectify reading as many as I can of hers.

Fully. Both the plot/posit of Pastoral and the characters within it were 5 stars. Plus the prose was excellent, some would say all the way to LITERATURE with the big L. For me it held too many similes. At points I got distracted by the forms themselves instead of being immersed within the tensions and progressions. Which WERE mighty. Best I have come across in some time.Travis narration of the very first part was just too much of that simile prone description for my taste. But once I got through his disaffection and self pitying druthers, the rest of the tale was not as overblown in that prose flow pattern.So I guessed wrong. I thought it was an entirely different ""reveal"" issue. Time travel is a favorite and it sometimes trips me up. But this quite different premise didn't at all surprise me. I give this novel the prize of the year (2022) even though it is only February's beginning. That prize for 2021, as well. TIMELINESS. ""What group think fear-mongering can accomplish"" category winner. And in our times of lockdowns, mandates, abuse and neglect of children as innocent by standers, destroying ambition with entire economic independence strewn away as a trifle etc.- that is really saying something. Just noted to a friend that I'm surprised there are not more fiction novels addressing the Covid authority monster with 20 heads.And Shea Ernshaw sure had a great way of saying it. And she did that here. Even the switching to different narrators didn't break the flow of tension plus (tremendous in this book) with too many repetitions. Nor did the Pox/Rot disease specifics lead you too astray to the dynamics of possible leaving Pastoral. Strongly recommend this read for anyone who wants to understand how ""eyes"" of outlook can be vastly changed. Without much of the will of the ""changed"" being a factor in the process for doing so, at all, either. And also how evil can work in full sight with enough positive reinforcement to fear of worse being threatened or repeated shown. And how entire support structures can be manipulated quickly to reinforce the consequences of overlooking that fear.

This is the period of her childhood and youth up to the point of Katrina. She exhibits and displays her street in East Orleans superbly. And also her Mom, Dad and siblings- all 11 of them. Also an aunt and the neighbors. Her Dad, who died when she was 6 months old, she does his personality to tale and memory exceptionally well. Simon Broom was just carved known. More than her Mother, who definitively is a small, solid rock.BUT- the longer this progresses to her NYC moves and other overseas assignments (Burundi) and to the aftermath locations to her siblings' visits and Carl's ""homesite"" sitting? Well, for me, the real Sarah was lost. Monique (her other name) was far more visible. She's a gifted writer. I really do not know or can remember one other memoir that was this tasty, explicit to detail and fact, and also did so LITTLE hold the real character or onus or personal desires to life's druthers about herself, the writer, than this one. She reveals next to nothing about herself at all in her mature form. The core of herself or goals or loves or forever emotional attachment bases- other than the leftover ones of her Yellow House childhood. I was nearly going to skip the last 15% as the Kindle read was so very long (and all the photos difficult to decipher) yet also filled with surrounding and minutia filler holding next to nothing of Sarah. But I did finish it. The entire. And THEN one of those absolutely hard to understand at all coincidence events happened. Not two hours later I tried to get on a recorded ""on demand"" episode of a long series I had missed on TV. And in the listening click of menu form- the C Span feed came in. And Senator Kennedy from Louisiana was interviewing and questioning one SARAH BLOOM-Raskin. I know of another Sarah Bloom too. All different people. So last week, never knowing the name at all. This week I look it up and yes, there are 3 notable celebs Sarah Bloom. If it happened in a fiction tale, I would never believe the serendipity of that coincidence. As much as I liked the majority of this book, I still only give it 3 stars for the obstruction to herself.It is far more a tale of New Orleans and the water. Her poverty was also in some points rich. At times I wondered if she had full appreciation of its power. I may try to get a print copy of this book just to see the photos. On the Kindle most of them were just a blur.All big cities have their ""East Orleans"" sections, btw. Mine absolutely does.

The placement in Iceland's capitol with the immense character development! That's why I had to round it up for a 5 star. Finn was good in the first book. In this one he is turned inside out. But that's just one aspect for this intrinsically complex and players within the double digits for all that is transpiring within the several plot lines. This reminds me to that extent for comparison to some of the great politico, international writers for intrigue, ops, subterfuge plying of the past. 40 to 50 year old Cold War stuff. But also NOT. Because this is timely and nearly perfect for the 2022 situations. Especially within the European status and country perceptions. But this is the only thing I have read this year that captures the fatalism, the logical mayhem, the depth of the present incompetence paired with misguided feeling.Regardless, this is NOT for everyone. It's brutal as a night mission to capture terrorist or mass murderers could be. Although aftermath and much else is also going on.There is a character in this one. Boone. Well, I sure can see the movie. He brought to mind that real life person who they called The Iceman. Very similar personality and livelihood. But a different type of body form.Corruption in military, corruption in governments of local and wide, corruptions in friendship, corruptions in any sense of life value! This reflects well and accurately.It's overlong and not entirely perfect. But close to that. And at no point did I ever feel a slog or a drag. Shit happens. Even to the most practiced and superlative practitioners of stealth and mayhem. All the short chapter shifting helped with seeing location counterpoint to an A level degree. Maps were also excellent in the hard cover. There was almost no ""telling"" but plethora volcanic showing.Death occurs for those who you would never think it will/would for a series form publication of this erudite and savvy context. But I realize that it has happened before (but I cannot think of one recently either). Our ice blue eyed detective's department and much else of Icelandic living is also 5 star. With what she/they have on their plate, it was a task that I am in awe of Webb and Mann accomplishing such quick and convoluted placements/actions.Body counts are high. Action begins the book and is literally throughout the entire. Navy Seals training also entirely embedded. Most of it within the territory of the Ice Maiden quirey had me still guessing. Not Finn's voids or guilts but the larger plotting with our Ukraine History Teacher! WONDERFUL character. Please don't let her go permanently away!Finn #3.

But I cannot round it up to perfect because it is 20 years later in dating and the crux/ key point omits were few, but they exist. Also it fails to catch Chicago brand energy levels. Then (far past), now, or in this particular period of the photos.Photographs from the late 1990's and the very first years of this century are the photo content. Only a few demonstrate the crux of change but I give them 5 stars for the Big Kitty pics in particular. From their serendipity first photo because it was the two main input authors' meeting place. And the ""after"" picture when the huge landmark character (12 or 15 feet high) was destroyed just ""for fun"". All laying down, mutilated, and full of holes.Evanston, Hyde Park are hugely over-represented but that is absolutely forgiven. I feel and read it was heavily their own territories, and also within the interests of outside IL people, completely understandable. 6 stars for including picture and notes on Sherman Park. Olmsted and myself both cry. Chicago has many, many beautiful parks and Sherman was the gem. I still believe heaven is the bridge and the white stone library. Now it is a central meeting place for 100's (literally) of gangs. There are many comments'/ personal witness that are priceless and truly real. Also with the timing of this book (great majority are more than 20 years old at this exact time period)- it was 6 star interesting for me the reader to see some of the restaurant scenes and read witness of the owners' stories. The one who came from Morocco was excellent. Hardly any downtown scenes and way too few on the South and Southwest sides. But I do forgive them because they included the huge Indian statue in Oak Lawn and the Stephen Douglas memorial is in there too. And also had a few from Roseland (truly and nearly destroyed as a whole). But no Beverly?Much has changed since these photos were current. A few places for the better, but the much larger proportion of these NOW are way toward the worse. Especially upon the working peoples' circuits included in the photos. Wendella's I believe is greatly diminished. Most everything actually is now from what it was then. From my youth, Chicago spirit and self-identity measure? No words for that comparison.Somehow or other the book only captures self-identity in Chicago at about a 3 star level. But the whole is better here from that considerable effort made to try. IMHO, the Tribune has nearly no connection to working or middle economic class Chicagoans at all now. No one I know subscribes to it anymore. If they buy one, it is for the puzzles. So absolutely true too the inquiries and pieces upon street names. No one of any age or identity group on Royko knows who the street is named for. Truly unbelievable reality.

But there is enough experience here stated in specifics for me to NOT do just that. It's, for me, a 2.5 star rounded up for the massive life series of jobs and authorities he exhibits. Not only for the forensics or detail skills of so many factors of bodily example that he evaluates either.His exact progression from all the work paths he followed from 18 years old on! That's exactly the kind of tale for knowledge and context that happened in my own lifetime. One that is just about impossible or highly improbable by strictures of present authority to occur. He left home very young and between military services and policing- he had more hands on complexity of process and law dictates before he was 22 than most have now at 40. And with all the energy of a 23 or 26 year old too. Mighty.There are two reasons I would not suggest a high recommendation for this book. One is that it is poorly written and does not contain sense of order either chronologically or within ""types"" or categories. Or even within geographic placements. Nor does it fully designate the path of decision except in some roundabout ways. I did learn that states within the USA have full dictate except if it is within a Federal building/ National owned plot etc. His is now a company that performs professional tragedy aftermath management.It's graphic. You will learn a whole lot about body parts. Having extra legs that don't match to anyone etc. And also events in which 225,000 people were killed. Weather catastrophes etc. But what lost this one entire star was his objective sensibilities in tone and in opinion. Some bordered on politico disgusting and others on ""these are my standards"" and that's the way it goes. Not that I believe he is harmful purposely to survivors at all. But this man has enough of his own voids and quirks- not to become in ANY way a lens for counseling or some aspects of evaluations upon emotive sensibilities (as he certainly believes he does.)Regardless, his is a job that few will or could do.

It is also highly dramatic, clustered with emotional volcanos, and also horror in the full demon and evil afterworld sense.And that alone is highly atypical for something written in the last 20 years, IMHO. That absolutely succeeds here- the possession. In fact, the only other one I can think of that did this as well or better was Haunting of Hill House. Yet, there is large emphasis time and again throughout the entire novel of repeat phrasings. I got truly sick of hearing about smoke streams and copal, for instance. But that's not what lost the whole star. It was the the over the top numbers of nasties and by the end the increasing body counts and their motivations. Tad bit overdone. And the gymnastics to do them all also got physically ridiculous. At the beginning of this book I got sick of the switch (happened too quickly the first few times) and also of our new bride's personality overall. (Wa, wa, wa- me, me, me) But then by page 60 or 70- Andres fell more piecemeal into the copy context and the jarring aspect of that book start didn't figure to the feel much at all. I'm glad I continued because truthfully, I almost made this a DNF before the story settled into some relationship within the parts. This is also atypical for having a poorer beginning and much better middle that the current trend of fiction. That I was super glad to experience. Lately I have hit at least 20 books from 2021-22 that have terrific beginnings but go downhill like a lead sled from there.Really a nasty, nasty house. And some evil people. You are going to hear way too much about stucco and copal though. And other continual repetitions. Beware too, there is considerable violence and nasty even beyond the murders/ deaths.Oh, forgot to add. Some readers will appreciate the Mexican ethnic origins cabals, societal class system, and some strongly solid Catholic embedding. Not that Padre Andres is the common post-Mexican Revolution parish flunky either. And she did get at least 75% of the Catholic sensibility correct. At least in ritual and faith aspects.

But honestly, this book is equal to a 10 star philosophy, logic, structural world order, mindset of? Well, how long ago did history start? Yes, they bite off, not a bite, but an entire banquet table that reaches from Earth to Mars. Far more than the Roger Bacon century piece posit. All the context of the Greeks, Roman, Christian, Arabic etc. etc. etc. How the 11th through the 16th century changed worldview and the entire human mindset mode in many locations. The entire teeter-totter of moral reason/ human knowledge/logic parsed in 1000 personality and influences progressions over 300 to 400 years. So the reading of the book is convoluted and yet masterful within specific minutia. And yet the title is merely a Roger Bacon insert.It's an excellent read for giving clearer path knowledge to where/who/how. I learned much of the two major Arabic genius inputs etc. But this is not for the faint of heart to approach in the scope of history needed to understand all these philosophies and written or oral arguments. I'm glad I read it. And in the form I did. Because flipping back and forth was essential. So many languages, so many brilliant men. And yes, they all were. Male.A better approach to this and somewhat different to understand too (better ordered)to where Western Civ. and other huge banks of knowledge and practice to empirical truths or to practical applications as history displays? You would need 6 or 7 volumes for this nugget subject alone (philosophy or scientific process of evidence etc.). So if you find this too hard to follow, I would strongly suggest Ben Shapiro's The Right Side of History: How Reason and Moral Purpose Made the West Great. That basically is dealing with the same issues here- that entity evolved comes almost entirely from just two fonts. This book by Goldstone will be far more difficult to convey for enjoyable understanding if you have little knowledge of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates specifically. Or do not hold a good grasp of Islam or Christian core progressions over time. European and Middle Eastern history buffs will get more out of this too, by far.But if you are only interested in Roger Bacon and the title document- you will be vastly disappointed.

Here the Reality TV world, tech and DNA website/company operations are pivotal to all characters. As the Internet/ Social Media truly is the Wild West (as mentioned exactly) -the Boomerang group to avenge despicable trolls was also spot on for precise conceivable aspects of ""right now"".So I have to also state I made Wilde #1 a DNF. And here with #2, I nearly went for all 5 stars. Why? It was the juxtapositions to the complex plotting and also a more fully character development all around in #2. That doesn't mean I completely swallow the first premise of a boy raising himself in a NJ wood. I don't.But I couldn't give it a 5 star rating. It was too uneven in pacing and tension. Both. Up to the page 200 mark it was all hearsay and switching tell in 75% of the copy. I was enjoying it though just BECAUSE these online jumps to different internet or phone connected groups WAS good. Rather ironic when I consider the middle parts. But the Boomerang group especially was nearly a ""no fit"" to the rest of the novel progression for more than half of this book.Then after about page 250- it became a 5 star read. Nearly the opposite condition from most best selling post 2015 modern genre- which are having better beginnings and go downhill big time after the first half and then peter out to awful quality endings. Here, after page 200- there were also far less TV Reality star repetitions for more tell explanations of the same occurrences re the popularity for by Jenn/Peter/Marnie- all three reality stars in their dramatic cabals. I detest one of these continuing Wilde book characters that Coben seems to love and to whom he lets express himself, IMHO. Hester, the defense lawyer. He gives Hester an opinion re various and dozens of ""things"". And slants these opinions in conversations with differing others, like with Wilde in this book.

That wasn't the only opinion of Hester's coached in nicety hubris of smooth Coben prose flow that was disgusting either. And it made me wonder if others caught this monstrous leap of rationalizations here. It wasn't only in Hester that rationalizations were off either in The Match. But mainly they were expressed within her voice. But not always. Moral relativity gone mad poached as a norm viable condition of judgment. But that's our times right now too.Regardless, I loved the plot, the web grit layers, the phone gymnastics, the DNA database minutia and also the characters in Vegas, NYC, and even the group at Laila's.This is the first book of 2022 that I did not guess the perp within at any point. I surmised the Peter part but was lead otherwise in several other directions. Very good plotting- 5 stars. If the pace of the book was up to its convolutions and complexity- it would have been a perfect piece for its modern thriller category.And the ending made complete scientific and real world sense too, on top of it.I will definitely read Wilde #3.

Yet, it's too long, despite all the top rung character development skills. For about 75 to 100 pages in the middle, Robin & Strike get kind of lost in the weeds. But that did, in some aspects- hold many pages not for the case of who did in Owen, as much as for individual growth/change progressions for the two primes. Most especially for Strike, leaving 20 years of Charlotte behind.LOVED to death all the London travel scenarios. Even more than the ten or so circle of suspects and all their publishing woes and hierarchies composites. Getting half-brothers and old Army friends in there too was nifty. Nothing at all shabby in how access included they were either.This is much, much better than the first one. I WILL read this series now as they appear, if they appear. Despite all the quotes and asides for classics or other public school fodder knowledge references, which are never favorite depth aspects; I will read further of Strike and of Robin. I guess Ben Jonson, Shakespeare etc. are not throwaways, not even under the most peculiar reference circumstances either, when it comes down to it.The scandalous book segments themselves reminded me immensely of the Harry Potter type of gross hyperbole or analogy. The author also does the same thing I disliked about those last two Potter books here. Gets so bogged down in character effusive detailing for such lengths that the plot gets backed up into cul de sacs and holds. But the people were interesting enough all around here that it was not as downer or moody souring as Harry's crowd absolutely became.This turn of nasty for so many successful celebs did pull the tension. But just a bit too long.I guessed it had to be one of two ""in the circle"". And I knew from the middle that it was in the writing of the words themselves for our not yet published tome that would reveal the real original to Strike. But close to the ending, I thought it was the other one of the two- and I was wrong. Being old and having friends of immense context still alive who remember what I remember from 60 years ago in common together and even shared experiences! People who don't have that, don't tend to consider that you do remember all the injury, as much as all the comfort! IMHO, the depth of knowledge about another is hard to describe. Forgiven, but not forgotten. Being ignored, scorned, or just always second or third fiddle - the pot could be narrow but it also could be deep. Let me say- VERY deep. Death bed confessions of friends (I've experienced two in the last 6 months)- they are truly a window of what people hold at heart remember.This author is a smart cookie. Her politico in fiction is very wary- her characters do- they do not preach/teach. And they ARE doers. Does anyone think that Robin and Matthew will reset the wedding date?

It's almost 2 hours since I finished this novel and I'm still hyped. Certainly need no caffeine in any form.Those who know through practice, they may realize I do not give 5 stars often. And this in particular will not be a 5 star read for all general readers. But in the concept of THRILLER, in the sense of definition to what thriller core means as a genre? This is one.The first half is military aircraft carrier tech and personnel tending toward the glib fact and dry. It's also a long, difficult read. USA Navy wise or context wise to both politico and psychological. And although the chapters are short, the shifting from Finn is also rather distracting. Although so many voids and holes appear, as in his memory? Well, it is shifty as the Gulf or the Pacific. With just as many shadows of monsters flicking through too.It's also very, very gore held. So this is not a read for all of those who have thin skins. Any type of thin skins. Physical description to emotional blackness- this is early Stephen King chewy. Be warned.It also held some of the prime tenets of authority and conscience. Both of groups and of individuals as loyalty to groups are served. It also embedded sisterhood of women friends, brotherhood of both and every type too.Also, the last quarter of the book was masterful. All 8 or 9 primes coming to various crisis or entwined revelations peaking at very close to the same immediate times. Blood rising TENSION ensues.There were 3 of those primes I thought were possibly the snake in the ship. Narrowed it down to two before the last 50 pages. But it is truly harrowing. Regardless of guesswork. Especially within the bowels of those mazes, dungeons of recycle, miles and miles of metal and ladders /levels. Just enthralling in scope. Kind of like Die Hard when he was in the elevator of the skyscraper. Massively interesting to all the equipment of every ilk too.

Publishing, print, scientific inquiry focus turning, ability to read and communicate going well beyond your own town or city state for a much larger proportion of the populace! All of it. So much going on during the turbulent and vastly changing of the entire world ""knowing"" during the 16th century in general European continental arenas.This book BEGINS to put a lid on the entire pot. Why it stirred to a beginning of meld, how it boiled, and how the gel became set or melted to escapes and expansions across the seas. But an entirely altered world existed after 1700 than existed in 1399. Even to the onus of what or how (method, places to ""learn"" etc.) one thought at all.So many names in this I did not recognize and learned through the Goldstone eyes. So many changing their birth names for a celeb name too. That was never overlooked. Especially within geography/physical Earth measurement or in the crux of medical information about the human body. Not just the book for which the fearless scholar gave his life so horrifically in the title either. But leading to, surrounding and enabling his treatise volumes for the times and what everyone else ""knew"".Heresy did not only apply to theology tenets as we would describe them today. Not at all. Galen principles of the human body forms themselves; disagreement with that could be heresy and censure. Deadly or continual exiles. Take your pick, if you were lucky. If not, after a lifetime of medicine you could end up dying alone after a shipwreck. Few, no none, had happy tales. Doers for the thoughts that they believed might be true. In every field, bravery to even admit of it.And like so much that happens in human history some of it is almost entirely the serendipity of right place/ correct timing. Like John Calvin being diverted to Geneva when that wasn't his destination at all. Just in time for the battle (he never knew about) ending there with the Reformers' Duke's side winning. Or the happenstance of so many of these primes being carted off to Alexandria for completely different objectives and being able to study there.Excellent and so inclusive is this non-fiction gem that I would put it definitely in the top 5 best read in the last 10 years. The only book I can remember, for my own reading, getting as much out of was the one on the 10 lessons of Geography that I read about 5 years ago. Strongly, strongly recommend reading about how humans began to truly read. And all the trouble it caused. Still does.And how the Prince of Peace was served by wraths of those who owned to know Him best.

She's correct, that's probably the worse statement Obama ever made. THEY DID MAKE IT. Innovation and invention is not equal across the world. Nor has it made the vast differences in health or longevity in parsing time periods or social / authority structuring styles as apples to apples either. It has been individuals with ideas and quirks and years and years of their own invested hours of repeated trials and tries which has given homo sapiens the great leaps forward. And even some large steps at that. But that air conditioning story is the tops. Think of the places which have been habitable because of it. Not to mention all the processes possible by changing humidity in the construct possibilities. (Read these lists: chewing gum is one.) I read here all the time about how some fiction caused endless hours of bawling. I did cry on one page for an instant here. My Mother said this to us at least once a month- and when we were very little we did a teapot skit /dance to it. I still know the first half of the words. It was popular in the 1950's for sure.Page 175:Somebody said that it couldn't be doneBut he with a chuckle repliedThat ""maybe it couldn't, ""but he would be oneWho wouldn't say so till he triedSo he buckled right in with the trace of a grinOn his face. If he worried he hid it.He started to sing as he tackled the thingThat couldn't be done. and he did it!Excellent book. The ending went too heavy politico for the crowd who thinks individuals are just cogs in a wheel- thus the minus one star. But I love that I heard about individuals which I did not recognize as knowing their names. Like Owens, with glass. Or the differences too in our patient (USA) system. And how the Founding Fathers who wrote the Constitution were FULLY perceptive of this important individuality of ideas. Strongly recommend this read. Learn about the origin of some of the unappreciated factors of invention that have made a longevity record achieved presently possible. Some of the outlier thinkers of form, engineers, scientists, (even a guy who looked at dirt and saw something else)- here are their stories.

Although my enjoyment of reading never got beyond a 2 star. It was because with the various splits of ""eyes"" told and placements, as well, it didn't hold together as a novel much.At first I thought it was masterful that she put this through Smita's cognition and judgments with her voice being narrator since she bridged both cultures, many social aspects of female in India etc. BUT putting Meena's voice in there in italics and going into many other tangents of Muslim/Hindu village speak or characters introduced past the half? Nope. For me that worked in effusions and in logic exactly the opposite. Plus giving the juxtaposition of the two outcomes for this ending as they got rather ""tacked on""? Commercial, and totally contradictory to reality of emotions endings? Scripted. It was also a depressing, depressing read. Coming from a Honor Culture which did these kinds of treatments in nearly every village at least a couple of times a decade (not Indian continent either)- I just didn't grasp the tone of this book either, nor some of the glib politico posturing elements. Smita would never have been so rude to that Indian matron who was like a mother to her either. Not on a visit like that after so many years absence. That level of disrespect for being raised there until she was 14- I thought it was another scripted tension ploy.

I almost gave it a 2 star for the pick and choose eyes and giving so much copy to the authorities (principal, teachers, workers for social programs' access like free meals etc.) as opposed to more than less than a dozen of the student individuals. But it is still worth the read and it is an interesting place for sure. This book would lead you to believe that this is a immigrant ""norm"" entry in Chicago. There is almost NO truth in that assumption. These kids are all on their way to somewhere else. Within a period of 2 years too. Just like the boy who moves to Lansing with his Dad and siblings at the end. These families are not in 3 to 7 generations of dependent welfare but are in transit to finding work and also somewhat their own ethnic communities elsewhere. Which in nearly every case they eventually do. The entire book conflates this entire immigrant issue with a slant that most ARE families with grammar school or teenage members. And it also misinterprets the neighborhood too, IMHO. My brother's translator in Afghanistan was given his family's first housing in that exact location. (They have been here 5 years already and have had 3 more kids since then, we don't leave behind ANYONE in our family. They live in the suburbs now and came to my Thanksgiving before Covid.) And all of this context schooling is more usually a temporary situation for the great majority who enter, most of them are also legal entries. This neighborhood has HUGE numbers of police, access help, agency for transfer etc. The children are 90% stable (mental/health checks) and the language and customs are the more horrendous issues to overcome. Culture shock is not fun.Customs in other cultures are almost all centered on very early and mostly arranged marriages or have ""honor"" systems. Mine did too. So that is another big barrier. But this is not a school which has the gang death fodder, nor the drug addiction family, nor the lack of working adults within 4 or 5 generations of dependency which you will find on the other side of the city. A system which just this week has also decided that the teachers need every Friday off now too. And also with home ""lessons"" - the reading and math scores are too horrendous to even quote.The balance of the book was off. But it is worth the read time. There is nearly nothing from this period written by, in, for, about Chicago in 2021 that begins to tell even 1/2 the truth. Even the levels of some formerly excellent museums are collapsing. Another happening this last month- is that all the volunteer docents for tours/lectures etc. were fired from the Art Institute. Identity politics.

I can't round it up because of some comments, assumptions, and cause/effect types of suppositions throughout this work which are not valid. They definitely dwell in the neighborhood of opinion in a ""looking back"" set of eyes. Economics and racism both are rather distorted.For my reading, the very earliest period was the most interesting. That was more informative of the events before 1940's (1919 race riots etc.) and the very real physical aspects of the Southside and middle Chicago areas (like the Pekin Theater etc.). As it entered the periods in which I was alive, there, and completely remember- not at all. Gangsters and gangs should have been defined. Also nearly half of the book is Mafia centered. Why? Of course there were intersects galore. But I can remember ""Numbers"" (it wasn't called policy by the users) forever. Some of these events were literally on my block or within the very next few major intersections. My Grandma's store was on Wentworth in the South 40's. I lived at 52nd and Racine until I was 7. My other Grandma had a house for 40 plus years at 56th and Carpenter until the 1990 period. The rest of my youth to middle age was in the 80's South between Western and Kedzie. Crime was always a factor but never at all like it has been in the last 15 years. This book completely misses the core of the economics bottom line to practical applications of what happened. It barely surveys the biggest gangster organized cabals. Johnson's ""war on poverty"" succeeded in breaking up the Black family and since that period it has been all downhill for the majority Black populations. Gangs took the role of fathers- self identity was obliterated. This barely scraps that surface of crime resulting.Yesterday was the last day of November.

Also for the many paged character carving repetitions of descriptions for the same 4 characters. But truly 3.5 stars in basic plot and 4 stars in locale and place feel. And 4.5 stars at the levels of twist she contrived more than 3 times near the long awaited ending. Very good for a debut book in this genre. This author has big time commercial success potential absolutely. All she needs to do is make her writing a whole lot word tighter and less hyperbole effusive for each and every daily movement across a room or going to work drive etc. Books with psychologists in key roles are never my favorite, so my rating is very generous. Actually I almost made this a DNF at about page 65 or so. But then after several pauses to pursue other reads I took it up again and continued. At exactly page 106- I was like a cartoon character with a bulb drawn over my head- I just instantly KNEW who did the serial murderer crimes when Chloe was 12/13. I was 100% sure and wrote it down in case I didn't finish the book with this library check out rotation. So again I stopped Flicker in the Dark and didn't continue until another book was read.Then after reading 200 more pages while also watching playoff football with immense distractions and numerous stops and starts- I decided I could not have been more wrong about my sure thing guilt person. And yet continued.And at the ending. I was completely and totally correct at my page 106 surety. That has not happened to me in eons as much as I read. Sometimes I guess right but never in such an ""of course, so how she going to fill another 240 pages?"" So without any spoilers here in reaction- know you are going to be lead down a WHOLE lot of false truth paths during this drawn out Chloe's perception book. So much easier to pull off in fiction than in real life, btw. I also knew the states in which it is legal for PsyD's etc. to prescribe. Illinois is one. Chloe should never be a psychologist and should be absolutely stripped of her permissions for and within her state of Louisiana. When I went to graduate school all those years, I met TONS of women like Chloe in that profession. It was one of the reasons I used the Counseling degree within other work practical applications and never did a job like she had here. Nor ever got much of an appreciation for that kind of introspective ""help"" either, to be truthful. So, Goodreads people, for me to give this 3 stars- take it like others giving it 4 stars. I would read another of Willingham's to see if she learns to use crux language of succinct target sentences instead of so much overblown effusion explosions for 3 or 4 characters in one scene.

It's about the title but then again great lengths of it are about her associates or mentor or events quite apart from Frances Glessner Lee's life story. At 57% of the kindle read and later at about 70% I almost stopped and made it a DNF. Very dry and not much more than the monetary and association history of what made this change from coroner to medical autopsy or evidence officer system possible in the majority of the USA.

Various legacy information and budgeting for the people like Magrath is entrenched within this book.Closer to a 2 star book. But I rounded it up from 2.5 for the information you got about Frances and her obsession with details in miniatures. Actually though, I never really felt I KNEW Frances herself much at all. Because I know the places and the Chicago history sites, seen most of them myself not too many decades after this, the book was more interesting to me than it might be for others. And these Gilded Age realities are nearly entirely gone by the 1980's or 1990's.When I picture anything like this process of art miniatures I always think of Coleen Moore's Doll House at Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago.

Science doesn't refute either the way I've read arguments insisting that it does. That was a chapter of considerable substance. Not so much with the chapter about Bible reliability, IMHO. Worth the read. The updated version is still somewhat dated. The truth of peace, happiness, joy despite the troubles and failures and suffering in living coming from self-identity core strengthened by a GOOD loving source is valid for humans. And its being missing in non-believers is observable to far worse outcomes.

Because of the dynamics of that time in Romania?Or is it the coming of age tale that registered? Neither of them did for me.The physical descriptions of life under this ""just before"" the overthrow 1989 are 4 star. Little else is, IMHO. Yes, everyone was ""the enemy"". Even those who lived with you or held the same blood. And the horrors (especially for the orphanages established then/there) this actually UNDER emphasized the cruelty and deprivation of place and exact time. By consistently underscoring a coming of age tale in rather a back door method of doing so- you get neither the boy turning man well beyond his druthers- nor do you get the politico terror and ""disappearing"" outcomes of the reality here in any full measure, IMHO.The only thing I can reason about this novel- is that people (some/MOST) are so unaware of the situations in these Eastern European locations for most of the last half of the former century- that they just go with the misery quotient and don't begin to evaluate the prose form or actual crux contexts achieved.Romania of that era and just before has some number of witnesses and voices in Chicago. As do the larger numbered Lithuanian groups of immigrants for the last 50 years. (Doing it all the most difficult way possible on top of it- legally which takes eternities of time and more funds for them than for any other groups whatsoever.) So I have heard realities of starving and spying quite worse/ beyond this level of tale from the horse's mouth, so to speak. The prose style here too is just plain bad with terrible transitions. Communism almost always ends with complete negation to any individual choice whatsoever. And less goods consistently over time. Sharing poverty and misery because the elite know better. It doesn't take a power mad dictator or personality cult either for it to happen quite quickly. Balance and pace of the book were also way off.

But it was the continuity and cohesiveness aspect (scattered more than connected as a flow) and the stark high water levels of violence. Made even more tragic by the reinforcement of the various tracts of WWI trench memories of constant brutal and savage death.Reading this within one week of viewing on tv (total coincidence and they happen) on The Swamp People- the tracts left by the Cypress lumber process- it was intriguing to read about Nimbus. The man on tv was a descendant alligator hunter but was trolling for big Cypress logs. They call them ""gold logs"" now. Some of the biggest of all were lost with broken equipment or sunk too far to redirect. And those trunks are just as strong and whole as they were then. Being in water for 100 years is a cipher for their type of constitution. Actually, this book was and read very much like Deadwood or any other railroad building wild West period endeavor. Just with more wetness, bugs, and snakes than the ""usual"". And the Saturday night bar or poker table scene similar. Furthermore, not all that different from today's hanging gang banger corner or home ""shop"". A bunch of highs killing each other with knives and guns. Extremely similar. Often for less than the take as these were too.The brothers' story made the whole book palatable. But I truly did not enjoy it more than 2 stars. And was considering that rating, but I thought the women's angles and the story of Walter did raise the bar. He is an exceptional writer with an incredible metaphor or simile habit which truly creates a mood and pictures for the reader. Yet this one was not his best, IMHO.He predicted here it would take 1500 years for the return of a huge Cypress forest. It won't. And there are still right now just a few lanes open enough to even air boat. Cypress smalls have become cypress larges. Very, very violent.

Which is an intrepid tale of the logistics, methods, and people who combined to set up repeated survey and eventual location presence at Target One area of Honduras. The tasks alone in that Cessna which used technology to view vast areas under the plant life, earth and various elevations was daunting.Also superb was the particulars of the jungle/rain forest/ mountain fissure valleys etc. in Honduras itself. As was the telling of the various ever changing coups and authorities (corruptions of drug cartels running all) needed to access any permissions for such a dangerous and deeply complex project. That was all 4 stars despite some variance of leaving the general topic for other personality or history quip aspects not all or variously unrelated. (That loses one star absolutely from the get go.) The snakes like the fer de lance and the insect life alone was enough for me to cringe at some of these situations encountered during mere ground level accesses. Not even all of this extreme danger is within the targeted area either because of so much other later ruins or present day deforestation outputs going on toward the direction of its valley fissure. Location moving jaguars being the least of it. Setting up hammocks/ camp by individuals (that task alone) sounds worse than nearly any exploration situation of which I've read. Stepping over a log can cost you your life- you need to step up ON the dead trunk or branching to see what is on the other side. It could be any of 10 other forms there that could poison you. Quickly kill.But just past the halfway point of this book, it starts a bigger spin. It goes off the real to the supposition. And then it goes into theory and also side steps to long aftermath of diseases caught during this sojourn by this brave and adventurous group. Mainly being the consequence of getting leishmaniasis (parasite) from sand fly bites and the entailed treatments (extremely various for numerous individual reasons) given to the sufferers. All of them. Different types of leishmania parasites, on top of it. Still after bundling the entire body in covering of layers and wrap.Also he diverts into entire territory of knowledge that becomes related within insect, animal, biologic or plant life criteria that is just that- either partial or at times almost guesswork. He doesn't know what he doesn't know. This was before Covid and he mentions Nika and past pestilence in various ways that are just inaccurate at best and theory distortions of history at worse. And he details Fauci mentioning that the pestilence of 80% mortality will occur. Amid other fear mongering theory projections. And re the 3000 or 4000 year old homo sapiens history distortions in between? Some of them didn't even hold theory level toward reality. Also why the original populations left? It just didn't belong with the scientific exactness of the first half of the book. So I did round it up though after some consideration. For the first half essentially. Regardless that all of this original people of the Monkey God city (spread out way more than any Maya or afterwards groups) supposition/ speculation and the cause effects of the last quarter of this book is barely a 2 star for this non-fiction category.

But after some pondering to specifics I can't round it up.The premise was not unique. I've heard the collaboration for revenge tale dozens of times in print, in film, in observation at that. But to this extent, it was still outlier.That's the crux difficulty though. All cabals of such size will implode. That large quantity of members never being able to in several ways (not just verbally) keep the inside in and the ""outside"" out. Cognition demands complex criteria over time to break it up. All cabals- even the largest and also the most insular secretive or abusive angry will eat themselves. Even governments.But in this study the value or equivalency of ""justice"" itself is analyzed and defined. Not in simplistic ways either. Where is the ""eye for an eye"" not really about the eye at all but the entire head? That's the type of question this ""what's it all about, Alfie"" wider and effusive/destructive core is seated. So the form is at least average, maybe above average in the reality of conversations/ dialogue. But all the same the very chronological time line details of these peoples' lives don't for placements or for reality of movements (driving, time away from ""others"" etc.) seem very realistic or practical application doable either. Not even in an age where insular lockdowns or other modes of singularity living are more at odds to happen. With so many people being far more the ""free agents"" of movement ""noticed""?Real and vile injustice happens. All of those posited core responses to victims are exactly what the book states they are. Kind and dogmatic words or form? It's minutia equations to no purpose or any true means to succoring for the bereft and forever changed. That's the truth. Do I know.The ending was exactly what I thought it would be. And I foresaw at least two characters roles in truth that were not revealed until that ending. And I truly doubt Camille would not have seen them too more than she did.The reading pace was quick and I didn't feel the drag of the beginning at all as others said they did. This is one book suggested to me for which I did read some s during the read myself. You need to be a particularly faithless (not only in God, but nature/karma, what goes around/comes around too) person to agreed with all these character conclusions about what is bs for forgiving. And totally blind to its advantages, as well. I'm not either- so this book was pitiful at core to me in some regards of judgments. And I have been a victim myself enough to know why and how much to forgive. Or smite in retribution.But considering the current state of what is ""thriller"" now in print- at least this does have a recognition of there being such a thing as conscience. Not always true in current definitions for that genre. Or in media or real life observable actions either. All conditions and violations being redefined to nearly opposite actual quantities, outcomes, or detail aspects that used to be the crux- by the bias of the judger or ""authority"" media. Vile actions becoming subjectively redefined in the process.It's a slick book. But really, not all that unique. Such acts in either short, middle or long term- will immolate self and cabal too.

Too long and too over the top hyperbole in general. Although often funny, this becomes absurd and is NOT indicative of the era, as others clearly suppose and assume.And truly very sad at base too, IMHO. Specifics will follow.Later:The first quarter was very much enjoyed. As the book progressed it was almost in the complete opposite direction for my enjoyment level. Remembering so many features of 1952-1963! Elizabeth would have been in jail with that specific deep pencil stab. And that isn't the least of the events here that just would never have flown under the radar. It was a different mores for women, sure was. BUT! And the fantasy elements of the tale truly didn't fit with her profession or skills. Or scientific worldview either. Yes, it's fiction. BUT. And the Catholic Church bashing! After awhile the hyperbole of treatments there? You would never believe St. Vincent's or 1000's of other adoption agencies of Catholic diocese or particular religious orders did millions of them right. Yes, millions. 3 in my own family alone. This takes nearly every worst case scenario and contexts it as if it were the norm. People read early, some very early. But Mad was also way, way over the top. Not funny either the longer the book progressed. And the ending was Hallmark ridiculous. That would NEVER have happened either. So if you have no true real life in the 1950's bar- then you may be able to jimmy under this one. In the second half I found it difficult to return to Elizabeth at all. I don't recommend this one, although the writing form itself and the premise was good.Another strong aspect here that was WAY off was the treatment or history of active atheist thought or movements. And it was right in there constantly amid the nearly continual fervor of male bashing. It was stated you could never admit a disbelief in God or religion in public, media, tv situations etc. That is plain just untrue. In fact, during my first 30 years there was HUGE atheist movements active and very vocal. Even within local tv, like WGN in Chicago. Did this author or anyone who edited this not read any history whatsoever? Madalyn Murray O'Hair and dozens of others were nearly nightly news in my childhood.

For plotting and concept tale skills detail it is also a 5 star read. The viewpoint of eyes was so excellent here despite the various narrators. Their class, their dress, their deport, their lack of offense or quite the opposite- it was entirely 5 star to the core of the time it occurs and the project tone itself. You didn't need to have ""tell and tell"" within THE DIG - all you needed was the superlative ""show"" that this nailed. And nailed. Again and again. The characters actions and interface explains far, far better. 1939 was not filled with Chicken LIttle nay sayers. Nor was the era that followed. It could have been. But the reality of then in cognition and in emotion (1939) was held most EXCELLENTLY here to what it actually contained in real time. Oh, if I could post that aspect about even 10% of all the WWII era pap fiction that is out there presently.Mr. Brown was my favorite character. How they (all the bureaucratic powers that be of every level) because of education creds and lack of class status just knocked him off his dig? And the reaction of Mr. Brown himself to that quick as the bash of a eyelash process? And how he still helped and became entrenched (not meant as a pun?) into the end processes, results, fall outs of eventual ownership etc. Can you imagine anytime in this century when such context accompanied class and grace and TRUE governance to deciding processes would be possible? Or even partially enabled? Now Mrs. Pretty would probably be eminent domained out of the entire land holdings AND house. And poor Robbie would be contained by railings, fences, watchers with leashes: literally masked and tethered to the house porch. It wouldn't be a Sherry Party site in any sense at any time. Nor would that wealth of gold have this housing outcome. But I especially loved the role of the nephew, photography, and the people keeping their ""word""- even if that was at times creating totally unfair methods or outcomes of the dig project for authority or dominance.This book will not be for everyone.

I'll read all of hers. So far, I think I have read 3, and not in order of when they were published. But- this is excellent context to a era/century/placements that is nearly perfect.This will not be a read about feminist warrior women or some quota of current politico or theory glances of whole piece theory applied to the women of this crafty (in all senses of that descriptive word) noble world. You are NOT going to get a fiction marriage tale times 4. And the individuals themselves will be placed among a cast of 100's in leaderships, and of many dozens in huge role-playing for the power / influence levels of their daily worlds. This is also far more about economics than any theory or individual dynasty history that I've ever read. And also exposes the Crusades of Louis IX (St. Louis) beyond any reality or even synopsis of ""truth"" that I had ever been taught.This is a period in which the nation states of just 200 years later are not at all jelled. Not in any sense. Some of them are mere city state or county large territories. And yet and still- almost all the monarchies named are related and inter-married within each other. That little changed. Although at the very end of this period there was a group from the city of Hapsburg which made it in big time soon after and were the ""new"". But your 4 sisters. Settling the entire onus of eyes and experiences around them, their husbands, their courts, and their travels and interface was pure 5 stars. At times, even more. And the 4 girls' mother and father! What a strongly allied /settled/ savvy two in that marriage. Provence was not only the core of that world's troubadours and erudite but also core to the knights' intersects. What those females learned before they were 12 or 13!! No comparable person of that age would context as they were developed. In our present world, it would not be much civilly allowed, IMHO. Hours in deportment, church, study, skills, logic of authority concepts- body placements etc. It wasn't all embroidery, let me tell you.But in the long or the short lives of these! And the study observations of much unsaid on all these husbands and marriages, especially upon the character and onus of Henry II (really a hot and cold effusive under IQ'd dud)?? Goldstone does superb show. It isn't all her ""tell, tell, tell"". Not at all.Just guessing, but I would think only about 1/2 of this period's history readers of high interest would enjoy this long read. It's very difficult in names and geographic at its base, as well. It took me about 4 times longer than any other book of this period that I've read. The nuance to money and influence and bloodlines is just the tip of the iceberg, so to speak. Personality and health matters. More so for these than the average or common placed humans of that time. Of that I am totally sure. Being reserved or in anyway a peaceful complacent or quiet person was for these an absolute negative. Association and notice equated to raising the monetary and the knight/military support. It absolutely did.So many births, so many deaths. Never forget you will read of most, if not all of these primes burying numerous offspring. And that all travel and necessities of ruling were coupled with disease contact and climate fallouts never known by any, let alone themselves. Louis and Charles and Edward. All the big time crusades cross takers! So many deaths in hot lands and very few Christians saved by the ""rescue"". We were taught these were much more aggressive wars than what they were. They were defensive and also political. The only surprise to me was that the Reformation took 300 more years to fully bloom. Strongly recommend this book if you want to understand the EXTREMELY different mores, culture and cognition of the noble women and men of this period. (Beyond different in how most humans have cognition of ""real"" today and the relative moralism coupled with subjective morality in law and in custom presently.) And how English barons and no-bodies under two (John and this very Henry II) developed this new way to think about workers or regular peoples' ""rights"" or permissions. Magna Charta to Dec. of Independence and all the declarations and proclamations made in between those two. An entire new way to conceive of social /governmental organization started because of the voids left in practical applications by all of these brilliant nobles scheming and playing chess with the continents among themselves instead of dealing with the structured applications of law and justice within their own taxed groups of language or tribal identity. But these women were very evident. Not at all in the background for pivotal and determinate outcomes. Neither was their mother or Louis's mother.

Also in which the entire European continent was noble embroiled to the settling of territories and districts from territory states to much more settled country wide identity/organization. Wars upon wars with mercenary and paid knights as soldiers beyond the home guard brand. Nancy Goldstone shows her snark in many of the footnotes. I doubt all will appreciate some of the suppositions of judgment. Especially on the 13 year old James I being seduced by the 30 year old. And also some of the other summations taken as they were within the wider picture. Yet, as 9 year old girls marry and entire life's are settled too within months of birth within this period? I DO feel the opposite about Nancy Goldstone's footnotes than several of these other readers' s do. They reflect the common sense juxtaposition to reflect the 17th century reality. Superb.Skip the next paragraph if you only want to parse this book. Which I did not think was as esthetically perfect as the 4 Daughters of Henry II, but as close as could be in this after Reformation musical chairs and identity obsessed period of HUGE mechanical and scientific (not to speak of art) changes.I appreciate the equivalency of her own eyes (Nancy Goldstone's snark remarks). Some of those very determinations and thoughts have settled with me too in studying this period in the past. Especially under Charles I and all the Oliver Cromwell Roundhead fanaticism. When this present USA/ western civ. ""woke"" period started some years ago I felt/saw/define it almost exactly like the same as the intolerance of religious feeling that happened with the Roundheads. The same tone and chide and anger too. Only under another twist of definition. But very much more religion fervor cored and supercilious arrogance than anything else. In the same us/them judgment and censure to cancel. Also with the almost worst possible hypocrisy of leaderships too. James I and Charles I- peace but without a smidgeon of either common sense or practicality. And often in leaving close or closer high and dry at the same time. Lethargic and really unintelligent too for the most part. Continually disinterested. Not a trait for leaders.The Winter Queen, Elizabeth Stuart, had a life that was completely the result of the various weak and weird men in her dynasty. This book makes you really wonder what could have occurred if those early firstborn son deaths would not have occurred. Just as with Arthur dying and leaving Henry VIII in the earlier century. Or if Rupert had been the Winter Queen's firstborn. But these women, the daughters, living as they did mainly in Holland, Germany, France or in other locations other than England for most of their lives! That was certainly quite a window. Also how not only personality but a quirk circumstance of who was ""in"" or who become ""out"" would also defuse any married life some of them might have desired because timing was just off. Best not be born in a time where there are few right sided religion or hierarchy partners available. And yet again, disease. Age 50 being old and 60 ancient. This book gave me insight into this period which definitely held less context rich core in past studies for me. Always the Tudors or periods after the Revolutions being SO MUCH more crux issued studied than this period was. A hard read. But a delight too. Especially in all the erudite or language exercise or/ and skills which these women and some of their offspring embedded themselves within as ""doing their job"". I can't imagine a life having more than a dozen children in which you live at the top of the ""goods and services"" hill while embedding in one place and language after another. While whole 5 or 6 years (up toward a decade) you don't see individual children or have more than 2 or 3 in any one place. Leyden was the only location where some offspring had more than 4 to 6 years running. You'd better learn 3 or 4 languages well. Within 1400-1700, it seems to be that the primary role of European monarchs was to raise funds for conquest (title to govern territory) and display while/toward associating the most highest rung players/movers/shakers for PR at the same time. And within that period, it seems that only a very few men were good at that whole picture. More women were. Particularly some mothers and aunts.

It is classified non-fiction and it is filled with 100's, literally, 100's of characters. At least the same 3 or 4 names in each generation, if not also in each siblings' descendants. You need to have a fairly accurate overview idea of the political divisions of Europe and the history of all these monarchies or district's nomenclature, as well. Maria Theresa (Empress of Holy Roman Empire, Archduchess of Austria, titled Sovereign of Hungary, Croatia, Bohemia, Transylvania, Mantua, Milan, Lodomeria and Galicia, Austrian Netherlands etc. etc. etc.) She was the core- 3 of her daughters' lives and governance all entwined follow with chronological varying between the 3 or 4 of them. One is Vienna, one in Austira/Poland, one in Naples, one in Paris.The book is so sectioned that I was engaged but not enthralled until Maria Theresa was reigning and into the years of her first wars and council challenges. She had 16 children in her first 20 years of marriage. Her stamina, physical energy, incredible intellect of inquiry is only in the shade of her protection of the dynasty. Boys matter. Girls for alliances.Most of her children also had large families although many, at least half of every generation died from either smallpox or TB. Many of them also in childhood of these and other ailments of infection.At about the 200 page mark I became absolutely enthralled and read overnight. And then after about page 419 I read some s. That changed my enjoyment to the max. As much as this author uses correspondence and very worded witness- she also makes assumptions. Some of them worse than what Zinn did to Columbus. There is just too much partiality and bias that can't be proven. Like the accepted truth here of paternity for Marie Antoinette's two youngest children- but other issues too. So I think it is a very insightful read- especially upon the American and French Revolutionaries characters and the inputs of money to those enablers etc. But beyond the very real facts of marriage, coronations, titles, laws, war and illness recorded etc.? It might have been classified fiction to be more honest? But I loved the footnotes. Especially upon Frederik the great and all of his personality quirks formed and observed. And his honesty in negotiations and ""word"". Every time I have studied his methods and outcomes I have thought the same thing. Also the author making the case for Autism syndromes of Louis XVI from birth on- I don't at all disagree. But labels like that are always subjectively changeable. Rather like the political language of 2021. Subjective information distorted is not far from lies. Most of the time it is lies. But the read was a 5 star of enjoyment for me. Because you saw / felt/ could view with full color portrait pages of high quality- these lives. These people did NOT own their own lives. Very few could BE for more than 2 hours a week- just base human. I loved the very detailed daily schedule of Maria Theresa. Up at 5 am and with Mass and at least 4 hours of religious or other formal dignitary meetings or councils. Lunch at 1 and dinner at 9pm. Dressing for all of those too. Plus time to read and compose plays or conduct /entertain with music? No wonder Ferdinand, King of Naples, only wanted to hunt or fish and never ruled at formal council at all but left it to his wife. Just joking. But not really. Oh don't forget the traditional required a few times a month too. Like dressing in 200 year old heavy cloaks and carrying a silver saber (all weigh about 1/2 as much as yourself) while jumping a stallion and having to ride it up a hill with the saber raised. Part of the continual job. (She did it for her Hungarian investment when she was about 5 months pregnant with her 6th or 7th kid.)The life of the Queen of Naples (Charlotte, her Maria Carolina) was just as poignant. Also a mother of 16 or 17 (depending upon if you counted stillborn or not?). Regardless, Lafayette to Napoleon- all the French Jacobins. What HORRORS! And who can say how long Antoinette's marriage was unconsummated? They all of them covered up witness or distorted their own avenues/paths after about age 25, IMHO. The time of the Enlightenment to ideas, vaccinations, political word definition changing- all of it reflects this current period to an immense degree. The vast personality characterizations for the Maria Theresa offspring, those siblings, was phenomenal in its layers. And placements in housing and within the family over structure. Do I know how the youngest get away with murder and often at the same time ignored! (Can you tell I was the eldest.) The s for this giving it 1 star? There is so much of worth here. If Zinn could be taught in grade or high school or college as valid history- than this is 4.5 stars. Marie Antoinette was not a fraction as bad as her publicity. She was a hate fixture for a vile political action agenda far more. This book made me realize something else.

Even within this dynamic of crowd association, overall attitudes were BETTER than the present. A placement and a story for which I had no liking either- lots of nasty, grifting, cons, etc. Overall people who wanted to slam doors in faces.

It is also accurate in the stats of humans in this world who live within any form of a democratic or republican form where the role of citizenship is NAMED in that manner.

But both the pace and the plot line as a introduction to a new Detective series was barely a 3 star. As an atmospheric literary piece it is higher, but not as a detective genre. Because of the very high ratings for this I had anticipated a 5 star quite like the 2nd novel in this series. But having the Catholic Church and these particular people within the #1 Strafford series (that's with an R as he tells you at least 7 or 8 times) as the heavy here and with the boarding school for orphans being referenced by many? Well between that and the first sex scene with Lettie, there was not a whiff of mystery or who dun it for me. So if you want no spoilers stop reading here. There was absolutely no question what was going on for me from about page 50 onwards. This was supposed to be 1957? Well I was not within Ireland but I was sure within the Irish. And the girls? The mothers with 7 to 14 kids each would not even pronounce the word ""pregnant"" out loud but used all kinds of euphemisms instead. Not that I doubt this could happen and did, but for me there was no mystery in the mystery. And the people? There wasn't a fully sane or good intent one in the bunch. I really wanted to give it four stars because he sure can compose some scenes. BUT, the ENDING?? How can we ever trust this so called law officer of the defenseless in the future? Would Brunetti or even Gamache walk away from the perp like that? NO! NO! NO! So for my brother, the homicide detective retired alone, I give this a 3. 3.5 stars as a whole but the aftermath ending itself will not let me round it up. And you know what- I like Quirke IMMENSELY better. The series should be cored on him. Not a police officer who uses subjective judgment without following the laws he is required to observe and support.

It's a who dun it of 23 years later when all the far country locale teen agers or kids are all grown up. So not only do you get their coming of age druthers, faults, crimes etc. but also the dire or depressive present situations. Or reactive. August as a character was not insular or depressive. Most all of the others were one or the other of those attributes. Olaf was pitiable- the bullied reject. Almost stereotypical. Yes actually, completely stereotypical.Eira is our prime character and the girl who grew up to be a police investigator. She lives mostly with her Mom who is in medium stages of dementia. She is entirely likeable but she uses men as if they were tools. Up until the very middle I was enjoying the book. After the first 100 pages, there became too much redundancy and repetition with ever lengthening page after page of past or present locale (Midsummer description) or history of the houses (then/now) description. By page 200, I had lost almost all interest in the early Lina missing case or the second murder case. Either. But I was not surprised by the outcome of the murder reveal. Just didn't understand truly that type of ""sacrifice"" motive. SO MANY of these Scandinavian noir type or mystery thriller have motives that are not greed or jealousy. Always with aspects it is not worth going to jail for (despite the VERY short sentences for murders /harm). Well, some of the characterizations are worth the time in reading. But not this particular author for me.Actually what nearly made me give it 2 stars was the writing style. Or it may be the translation? Well it jumps a lot. At least 1/3rd of the time I seemed to be rereading a paragraph to see where this ""fit"" for reference of pronouns or time lapse etc. Many, many abrupt skips to say nearly the same exact onus somewhere else? Also, and I could be terribly wrong- it seemed there are lots of ""out of order"" wordings in English?Although I like Eira and the town in spacious island, isthmus with bridges Swedish outlander type focus- I don't like the way of telling or observing in style or form much at all. So it won't be a series I continue. Magnus, Eira, August, GG are good characters but the overall writing or plotting? Meh!2.5 stars rounded up for the locale, the fact that Eira takes notice and feeds her Mom. It gives the story some fixed locations and personality insights too.Most will like this more than I did.

Only rounded up for the natural world descriptive and emotive language of the protagonists connections to that/ their physical world experience fishing on this creek.But I don't think this at all comes close to The River. Actually I am disappointed. The dialogue is basically faulty, unrealistic. Although the plot is filled with current known angst and similar concerns about mandates or rules and who is making them! Still, the way that this is posited overall in circumstances and at the pace the novel was strung? Almost preposterous. Slow. And that didn't work to make me feel more tense, the opposite. Humans, even subordinate folks? They are not that conduced to obedience in such a natural world environment. Most especially in times of anxiety, unknown disease outcomes or any methods of actual or virtual imprisonments. Well, I wonder what would happen if in 2020 or 2021 someone would actually begin to approach a yarn or story or novel or anything which was an ode to joy or happiness. What a time we live in for the literary. The most Gifted are also pulled into the piles of misery shared and observed. You'd think it would be the opposite. During the worst periods of the 1930's starvation poverty and disease death- all the movies and most of the books were ""happy dances""or imaginative singing added, or triumph tales of accomplishment. Even during WWII that was true. But it seems dire travails with almost no aspiration, ambition or inspiration- are now the jewels of the heralded published crown. Most actually seem to sneer at the point of those attributes themselves. With writing ability of such effusion and shining nature at the core yet. Will it get worse?? It's sure not getting any better in new published reads. You hardly, even ""in love"" or in any moment of contentment approach a half smile?This was also not enjoyable to read. Guilt cake frosted with evil manipulations in practice. I could hardly return to it. But I did at least 4 times for my ""dose"".Ugh! I was a huge fan of Peter Heller and that's why I rounded it up.

But it is not going to be a read that everyone of 2021 will enjoy, IMHO. Or even begin to respond to or grasp for its depth. It's the life tale of Marie de France, a bastard (through a rape by Henry) Plantagenet daughter. She's put away to an abbey (get thee to a nunnery) by Eleanor of Aquitaine. The year is 1158 at the first sentence and well into the second decade of the thirteenth century by the ending. The physical forms of language are beyond my ability to describe. But within the period words, flower/ plant, animal forms and pure dirt to skies of this observed world- it's done to near perfection. Hard to believe that anyone of this century could be tuned to the rhythms and pulses for all these sets of eyes.It's about the female. It's about core strength. It's about much more than the emotive or structural fall outs. It's about steeled leadership and yet it is also about the softness of total peace within loyalties. Or if not loyalty- convictions shared.It is absolutely not about perfect women. But it is about women who form and often choose a best world possible. But more so, the cores of Marie's visions (Matrix she) what they wrought in reality of this formerly mud and stink and death world handed to them.This also holds some exquisite prose. Poetry. The power of song's exploding and cresting joy. But for me, the psychological strings webbed here! In Part 3- the path of Sporta and her methods of deport! Lauren Groff has understood that such guiles and manipulations will have to be meet with those that are of equal extreme and smiling compliances. Loved the form of the novel, as well.

It is cored in the Federal governmental or military power to know better and control. And make a reality regardless of what actually occurs or occurred. It's complex too. As complex and intricate emmeshed as corruption and bias intent to death of civilians and happenstance murder truly is.The body count is so horrific that I doubt I'll read any more of these. Kevin's new wife, Sara, is more than fully partnered in her semi-annual occurrence of having to kill someone. Between the two of them, I believe in this series, each is up to 3 to 7 to 12 counts of demise. They are good shots. Rifle or other side arm. She is a lifer and graduate of the academy (West Point). In this novel, she meets up with some of her former school mates. They aren't doing it for ""practice"" now!Regardless, the plot entirely intrigued me and for more than just the reasons of how our secret services/ military have been politicized and are group think dominated. It also held a partial quite close picture of my exact employer. The College of Santa Fe is the offspring of the university and order that is the ""Midwest University"" noted in this book. I could have transferred there to be buyer and was considering it at one time. Briefly! McGarrity didn't give us a name, but he did the Christian Brothers of de la Salle to perfection in this location and in this plot. And all of their mores and cultural ""normal"" too.Of course, New Mexico in various different altitudes and climates is exceptionally described. We have a blizzard in some of the most dramatic portions too. But to be truthful, the beauty this time was lost in the horror of the government killers. Most, of course, assassins of School of the Americas fame-strongly suggested. And of the West Point training supreme first.This is cored to onus on the software systems that will be the end of a republic, privacy of any type, or monetary integrity or any news promotion that isn't framed on permissible group think mantra. And will have total mobility, opinion, or demographic individual information attached. Also which will negate any individual country sovereignty- not only on any one continent. Yes, the book is depressing, and quite actual real in method and purposes too. McGarrity foresaw only partial uses. He never got to the election software reality distortions possible and used- but nearly all else.It reminded (more than 4 times in this plotting sequences) me so much of the almost dozen Clinton ""disappearing"" or ""accident"" or ""suicide"" (Epstein was just one of at least 4) associate events. This is a book on the bigger and wider uses of FBI, CIA, Military, State Dept, Banking Head etc. that only can exist if they are ""one way, our way"". In either pseudo members of each division or actual duo or undercover members, being used for various ""protected knowledge"" services purposes. Sometimes fiction can get so close to reality that it is scary. This one was for sure. And written in early 2000's. 2002 published. The government intrusion into our lives is so menacing and quite ""normal"" now. Oh if I could give my descendants the freedoms that I lived and enjoyed. Keven and Sara are such killers themselves and have/ develop such terrible outcomes for their seconds in command and closest coworkers through their choices!

Comfortable, soothing, protective, and mostly love in its most complex sense to mind and emotive connections. This simply doesn't seem to be the state of pairing off or marrying in the law and legal sense of obligations and commitments any longer. Marriage for women especially never considered the end state achievement?? I'm not stating it as well as it could be defined. But it was defined. Differently. This is the ""eyes"" and sensibility of that era. A long era that I believe is almost invisible now, and in some poignant examples of reality sadly and entirely ended. So it's hard for me to read of such falling in love as many of these women do. Deeply and quickly and without much knowing the man. And how the men are so cored in the life that results. I knew many and saw many who lived these dreams and worlds. Chaste in their actions and thoughts and in every sense more responsible for other. And had 50 or 60 years lengths of happy endings.

But of course she will need to be away for the next 10 years. At least 10. Which I guess some might consider the base of an entirely practical and livable marriage. Well, at least you aren't going to be doing lots of laundry or dishes. Huh!Well, such a man's outlook IS very real. But be warned if you take this novel on. It's very, very sad.

Reading these in order only and it makes much more sense than some other series. This one has sharp progressions in his life work and style and doesn't encompass chapters of repetition. So the lengthy backstories are deeper connote and ambiance by far. Some series you can easily read out of order. Not this New Mexico locale or Kevin Kerney. Too many changes in advocation, vocation and climate/ altitude etc.This one had 2 or 3 different pivotal action spots and crisis points. Loved that because they also made sense to the entire picture of cartel and governmental involvements. Corruption alive and well on all fronts. Kerney merely the new appointed interim ""hired from away"" pecking order 2nd rung boss. That was good and partially believable for the set ups of authority (not only policing) in New Mexico.That someone who Kerney likes and understands in a positive manner is going to be tried for murder because of him is also an excellent dichotomy. Just my guess, but Addie is going to get off fairly easy for a police end misdeed oops? I bet we see more of her in future novels. This is only 3 and I think there are a dozen or more now. But the continual deaths of police officers also leaves me feeling quite the opposite. And they ""get it"" while doing Kerney's rote deed assignments on top of it. You'd think Kerney would figure that out and get some better security around him or at least a ""heads up"" to the officer substituting for Kerney? I guess that doesn't make as real of a book? He knew how much danger Fletcher was in too. Why not Gilbert?Regardless, the body count from all angles gets considerable. The mesa and arroyo areas in winter are superb and some of them are core. There is an under character that is prime called Robert. He is mentally ill and the village fixture crazy and was done to a 5 star excellent degree. This one was so good, I am pretty sure I will read all of them. But I did note a trend. One I dislike. Michael McGarrity has more than considerable bias politically and gets more than 1/2 the generalizations of labels not only wrong but almost hysterically so at times. I do realize that this is a time before such common tech and media distortion as exists now. And also Kevin can get mightily arrogant when asked some of these same opinions and within quips he makes. Especially since, as in this case, the real true corrupt in the government he is working for seemed to be the only individual (also his peon cronnies) which did NOT get taken down in this entire case or ploys related to it. The art is back where it belongs but so are the cretins of pay and play in the very same office. To me, that is little to be so arrogant about that you are leaving ""gotcha stuff"" notes for the cartel leader. ""To egg him on?"" That seemed almost juvenile considering Kevin's usual appropriations and methods. Inconsistent. This attitude approach is not in accord with the life/ cases/ temperament and action pattern. Also there are points that Kevin guesses things that I could not see most any path to have determined as fact; with him being so sure as to travel there for information. But McGarrity made up for that by his portrayal of Carlos. We shall see. Would be that the border could be like it was in this book now.

I’m in an adjoining room waiting for post-op to call me in. Been there, Lucy Barton. Still. “And then there is that, as well.”Isn’t there always.Later:Well, this aftermath look back from an autobiographic of later age is just excellent. Wit, joy, authority, and what makes an individual comfortable (as opposed to anxious) being SUCH an excellently posited core. How ALL of us consider our own selves, the essential self-identity, is not just developed by nuture/consequence but also made and can be full blown too from birth. Lucy Barton and millions of others know it. Because they've lived it. Me too.There couldn't have been a better book to read in a waiting room or during ANY precarious context of dire either. We learn what we want to learn and sometimes what we need to learn. Regardless, the outcomes are almost all self-directed.If Elizabeth Strout OR Lucy Barton had any interest in food and/or cooking- we could be twins. And not all of the people who know themselves live in huge urban environments, or do they all have the same context of their thinking or choices either. But the essence of joy and gravitation toward solid purpose and authority remain extremely similar in most any locale, regardless of how poor. Not insular though, but money poor. Strongly recommend women and men both to read this. You do not have to read the first Lucy Barton to enjoy or experience this one. It is absolutely not a just a women's read.Another difference though- my William was not as lucky with his draft number.

He's a favorite author and the writing is clear, nearly easy read - a full 4 stars. As are the excellent characterizations. But the plotting and the pace? I felt parts didn't quite mesh as a whole. It's a full 3.5 stars, but I can't round it up. There are numerous individuals' backgrounds that progress more like separate short stories. And all revolve around brief and misfit strains of anxiety or grief or void. I felt a few of these lengthy asides sections pulled too much away from Winston's task and prime inquires. But even more than that I was flabbergasted at his base lacks of deep background verifications. His trustfulness (I know this is not a word) for a law officer that has been standing sheriff? I know this is 1984 but you have protocols on ALL identities of services or aftermath authorities.Much sadder than his others. It just doesn't meld - more fanciful or hopeful toward idealist virtue/idealism, rather than fused and reality of true world outcomes. Not for the social issues or personal outcomes is this a read that holds joy as anything other than some momentary or transitory contentment.Most might rate this a higher rating for the misery or righteous scales alone. Especially the readers who love to cry.I do have to add somewhat later after considering his work on the whole. If you have not read other Wiley Cash, do read them. They are far better and also not filled with either tenuous or stereotyped categories of ""good"", ""bad"" etc. Some of his other novels were sublime and did not hold this scattered overlook which tried to be a town who-dun-it under a literary style onus.

Which was a current  on the subject of American Journalism and its past history toward the state it is in presently. Not that the title is misleading.

They were, almost every one, cored on religiously guarding opposing and multiples of opinions with real stats outcomes of those cases.

He's brave, outstandingly intelligent and funny- and especially patient too. And he can write- failed novels or not.It is just so incredibly sad that he has to be so little able to get others to understand the cognition and sense input he actually owns. It makes it so DIFFICULT for himself in mobility and also in relationships. If you have a strong onus for not asking for help (oh many of us do) in situations where you will absolutely require it? That's a conundrum.Knowing someone else who lost their sight after childhood, I think that their cognition for the world's ""look"" and connections as a whole make it maybe MORE difficult to interact than those who are blind from birth. Maybe not? He is incredibly brave to have continued with so many different living arrangements especially. No frail parent home dweller he. I wish him luck in all departments and a fervent wish that he can just come out with a declaration now and again that he NEEDS some assistant or equipment or arrangement for fun- so that he is not so limited in everyday choices.Lastly, I have thought about that store product choice angle endless times myself.

Because Reacher IS Reacher and he is doing his thing- I couldn't round it down. But overall this a 2.5 star for the series. This is why.What has happened to the character development for the primes met? Or the flow of prose that curtained the short, static, (usually for movement or descriptive of attire) sentence structure? With the addition of Andrew- it has DEFINITELY changed. Not for the better. Because you need VARIANCE in that type of ploy. Here almost entire sections are worded in those static 7 or 8 word forms. You need TO VARY the flow and not do same/same. Where is the ambiance of serendipity to romance, food, etc. It is there. But very, very little in comparison to the much better and earlier Reacher Lee Child singular authored. If you hold sentencing to great majority of that static type it has a much different overall read feel. It becomes almost all physical and also with the types of assault in continual play- rather boring. Sounds impossible within all that violent action, but it isn't at all.Here we have a case of a bad, bad guy's ""outfit group"" of terrible deeds being the nemesis target. It reminded me of the one in Kansas or Nebraska or Oklahoma which had the same single guy plague of evil going on. But here, you don't get the emotive element other than Michaela's grief. It's almost entirely threat, violence of action. To a much larger degree of the book copy length on the whole. Well, at least Reacher IS Reacher in this one. The last one, he wasn't at all. More like Reacher's zombie destructor twin. I loved the Morgue Doctor character in this one.

And I did not grasp the Rosebud moment to the degree that Robert Orlando seemed to. But I do understand about an iconic childhood identity fixture as was Hearst's sled or Trump's train set. Citizen Kane is supposedly the best film made of all time. When I took a Film class way back in the 1990's -it was featured there, as well. Frankly so were many that I thought nowhere near any of the tops made before about 1975 and some of those are no longer considered even ""average"" ironically now. Actually some of the historic are vilified to opposite hilarity levels now. Some of those ""best"" also didn't age well or did not have evidence of skill or style that stood the test of time. (Angles and atmosphere count.) A few do though- like some iconic scenes with Betty Davis or Clark Gabel. I am not a movie person as my opinion is that the ones made after 2000 plus are 95% not worth time or funds. Most not even if they are free. Low life, bottom feeder or just effusive hyperbole. There were some funny ones up until about 2008 or so.Orlando here is accurate and succinct about films and about this title comparison. Very interesting peak into a mind that seems to know the subjects and the psychologies. More than fairly well and in observing real world criteria at that! Especially upon the hatred and vitriol focused on the man for so long and what that contains.

But for me it was barely 3.5 stars and at points less. I could not round it up because of so many intense and angled toward the exact same emotions, or details Aaron relates over and over repetitions. It became way, way too wordy for me in the juxtapositions of his thoughts as well. And as weird and spooky as the atmosphere was the music and the lights coming on and off? That works in visuals immensely. For me it did not work in the print form. This would make a great film or limited series of maybe 4 episodes. That's where the atmospheric pulls and the minutia of happenstance redundancies aren't as prolonged and repeated as this was. His wife spent most of the time he lived with her being quite a liar. This is a tale where honesty and straight forward to core reality does not play much of a part. The marriage was idealized and the love swelling with maximum feelings. Yet masses of hurt was handed out in that too. Not a fan of such pretty convoluted methods of ""closeness"" as in this marriage. He can write. He writes all around the mulberry bush. The trouble for me is that when all is said and done, I just don't care for the taste of the mulberries. Sad and horrific tale, filled with violence in so many aspects. Anger designed and costumed as love too, some of the time. I can understand the youth effusion reaction. It's like a fatal accident you can't look away from and why all the traffic crawls through that arena of observing.It's just not a writing style I am attracted to for lengths. Not these lengths. Also it was hard for me to stay embedded. Aaron is not like any man I've ever known in my life, and I'm old. Other than the beer.

I bet it happens. My enjoyment for this read was 5 stars. I pondered for an entire day after finishing and almost rated it that high. But then I realized that with so many intersects and plot twists- well it's just too commercial for perfection.Read this one. Avery Chambers is probably one of the most interesting characters I have come across in a few years through print. And that is saying something since I read so many of these and tons of non-fiction too. Her 10 session and very high stakes psychology therapy? Well, it is comparable to being not only a psychologist doing counseling but also triple jobbing as tech investigator and moving piece spy/ tracker. Here the mental and emotional states are 5 star structured. Into fine niches of immense detail. Not only for and between the husband and wife at all either. Polly, the shop assistant and the father-in-law, Chris. They were continually floating questionable drones flying over the crux emotional landscape. Not only the ""home"" or history landscapes either. No clues and absolutely no synopsis. Read this one. Especially if you have connection with talk or action therapies. Or have had Mom ""school"" experiences (think Big, Little, Lies). Or like to read about fashion, style and class attractions of the D.C. beltway. Those were all done to a T. Or have an iota of knowledge about infidelity forgiveness.Politico. Business. Charity. Influence. It's all there in spades too. D.C. is truly its own low rise world.At about the 1/3rd spot I thought I knew the worst one. And after changing my mind several times I was not so sure. But my instincts were correct originally. That is rare for me to be convinced to a degree against my gut. Hendricks and her co-author, they did it here. Can you tell too, all the editor experiences between them. Lots of trivia, but nary a wasted extra paragraph. I could not put it down. I read it all in two sittings within about 20 hours. Because of all the placements, which I've been more than several times- I loved the locale sets. Next time I hope they use the Metro more, like they use the stations in Berlin (Germany) within so much accompanying literature presently. Great system. The traffic in that circle (Dupont) is endlessly confusing and dangerous, IMHO. The only time I was there with my birth family more than 60 years ago- my Dad (driving vacation) couldn't get off.Here Avery is a real human too.

Tremendous, dishy, incisive, crux to the core or completely the opposite dialogue on that London River Taxi route.It's commuters getting to their jobs in London on water. That entire scenario in description and movement to detail was 5 star itself. Jamie, our narrator beyond just unreliable, is phobic in the tube. So much of this entire novel is written core with psychological perceptions all around. And I'm not finding that so common in this genre anymore. I rejoiced in the depth of insight here to individual mood particulars.Two couples, 3 other workmates or riders. A splendor of elegant vast Georgian mansion to a let flat cubby hole galley kitchen corner; in every sense the serendipity to the physical real is compare and contrast here. And not between masses of under characters. Just our few carved personality ""well met"" companions. Only 6 or 7 people count in this one, all told. Done superbly every one.Between the great conversational prose poppets and the duplicitous violations- you have a work here that would make an EXCELLENT film. Expensive to film too because of all the shipboard or locale supreme placements. The Eye, Harbor Bridge etc. etc. But I could see this being classic if it was done right. A kind of modern Charles Boyer being Jamie. Do most of you know who that actor was? Or who he played? Well- put on your seatbelts, because it is going to be a bumpy ride.I think there may be one good intent or nicely moral person in this entire story. And there are tons of quotes about aging or mores of mod that I could add here. But I won't. Read them in the original. Candlish is nearly as good at writing this tit for tat chit-chat as Horowitz is. Hers may even be a bit more cruelly truthful. I will be reading more of hers for sure. No lack of economics lessons here too. London isn't the only place where people who work can't afford to live. As well as some deliberate elitist eyes to the hoi polloi expressed. But it was a bit too long and the ending could have been tighter. It was like a faucet that dripped too long. Make the final shut off already.And I just need to add. I saw it coming about 20 pages before Jamie did. Not just the prime offender but the onus of the year's ploys. I think I must have oodles in common with Clare.

After the first half, the usual sidesteps and angst Pitt family druthers or moving around and location description mode took over. Also some of the law aspects for a case which was left by a hung jury were not sufficiently played out in the tale despite 100 pages of looking back at a friend's and a workmate's memory and Pitt family interchanges in the story progression. The law aspects became mere mentions. All was so loosely tied into the present situation, when it should have been more detailed to ""hung jury"" aftermath. There were some very confusing leaps of character logic or knowledge in the novel as a whole that were circuitous. All kinds of other issues or concerns of reality to what may have occurred were possible. Usually the path to the eventual brutality or crime is far more clear than it was here.So it was almost exactly average for this genre and author. Daniel is developing in age but I found the period in which Charlotte was missing and Thomas Pitt more involved went beyond my believability quotient.

I couldn't stay with it on the whole as one novel, and came back reluctantly after some time. All my other books called. I'm surprised I finished it. Romance aspects and side streams took away from the rest of the core. Diluted it all.Regardless, the tone is off for Chicago. Only maybe would a 19 or 20 year old be this level of ""tone"" flow and interest context. Especially in the dialogue within the police world locations, on the job. Some of those were absolutely preposterous. Plus the conversation was not normal flow or content for adults in nearly any work place. And after years and years of hearing cops and nurses in those places or out of them (literally 100's of them as individuals too because they were students also)- I never heard such juvenile aspects of interchange. Flirting, foul, or out of place? Yes, of course. But none like the high school style banter in the police quarters here. Putting wedding veiling on chairs? As if they have any time for such ploys.Also all the Chicago references are stereotype banter mention and mostly the rote ones. Other than the Wicker Park restaurants. Which I doubt are any longer in operation. But may be. I've never been there. Regardless, this main character Annalisa is not one I will return to. This is not currently believable for a Chicago Police Officer. Possibly a State Cop who is working the Stevenson but not a homicide detective. We just this last week lost a female police officer making a traffic stop. Shot dead one month after having a baby. Not much joking in this style taking place around here. The characters are almost all way too immature to believe. This kills my interest in fiction of this genre in general. The ending wasn't great either. There was considerable plot confusion lacks.Ella French will be buried on this Thursday. https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=4......more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Aug 12, 2021","Aug 17, 2021","Jul 15, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54860343-gone-for-good

Very, very hard to read as the crimes committed by participants in this book are worst category. Psychology and the medical criteria (including DSM categorizations) are far, far from all the mish-mash that is presently defined as science. Often I have noted that RX psycho treatments are some of the worst outcomes too for any homo sapiens in any country, culture etc. But what I think is the worst aspect of suffering and outcome consequence of all is the nearly total lack of any quality control aspect or evaluation in being sent to a Psychiatric Facility (long term or as sentencing for a crimes most especially). There is no there, there. It could be 30 to 50 years or 5 months. All judgments are subjective.Psychiatric evaluations vary immensely between any two medical personnel within criteria judging. It is essentially true that any normal reaction could and will be judged differently for anyone who has mental illness acting out extreme in their background, as well. (Like any religious belief, for instance.)Prison is probably a better sentence for some of these people, and especially for the prime (Brian) of this tale. Very sad.

The writing never flowed for me to follow an ""alive"" set of eyes or did the people become flesh and blood real in print.What has always intrigued me the most is that they truly did not know what those territories or geographic vast distances would contain. Nor did the great majority of people who moved 100's, if not 1000's of miles with SO little knowledge of the parsing of places or conditions that they would meet, have more than some hearsay clues to nature or physicality.

But all legal and witness voices were done well.There are mistakes in the copy. Double words or extra words. It should have been better proof read. Not enough of them to kill the read, but they were there. Not your typical hard cover read- nor were any of these Genovese close to your typical American neighbor, IMHO. Most lived high class goods/ neighborhoods/ lifestyles. Genovese's 1st wife's funeral is worth the read alone. She died at 28 from TB which was rampant in the areas of Little Italy and all around NYC where she did constant charity work. She caught the kind that killed you in a month.Reading this gave you excellent windows into the times and ploys of organized crime to the mores of the populace etc. for those eras. But it didn't give a wide overview of criminal organization of Italian origin mob structures or hierarchies as did the book by O'Reilly. Not at all. That just published non-fiction (Killing the Mob) did the whole view to other mobs and the FBI/CIA or other politico get alongs to go alongs much better. Also to the history of downfall and what the old style morphed into, as well.One of the pivotal events was forming the Five Families of NY structure. And I felt this didn't detail enough the very serious Lucky Luciano and Vito Genovese long term (as far as any Mafia true competitions go) duo trysts/competions (I really don't know what the English word would be- but their neck to neck ""trust"" hierarchy and power levels) to both be the ""capodi tutti i capi"" (boss of bosses) in the America side Mafia at the same time.Brutal man. The photos were excellent and entirely him and just a few others in his various ages- including in the courts and in the final prison years. Not the family man pictures either. The deterioration of physical and mental is SO clearly visible. He was not a smart IQ man at all- absolutely under 100 IQ. He had another kind of smarts.About the only time I laughed reading this book was in the descriptions of stripping of American citizenship. And how much punishment, consequence- that was deemed to set upon the stripped individual. Moral shame, vindictive negations to process etc. Now it hardly would make any difference whatsoever. Citizenship rights? Also another observation. The Mob made mistakes in their violence and it was 99% against the wrong mobster or flunky not identified correctly. Innocent people were killed. But not in any proportion to normal by-standers or people watching tv in their front rooms with bullets going through the walls in street gang bang fights presently. They actually did know how to shoot too. Babies didn't get shot in the head every week if their buggy was anywhere outside or sitting in a car seat.

But it was not at all what I thought it would be. Which was a personal or pivotal to his long life study or detailing for the person. This is at least 75% the progressions of Thomas Sowell's determinations over the years within the groups and institutes for which he has been a pivotal part. Which to me, is quite different than a life biography. If you want more than a thorough lecture in Economic Theory and data for the various past movements of theory belief? Or if you want a more succinct progression of how Sowell almost universally uses outcome data and reality stats that are provable? Or want a hard look at the personal life progressions and setbacks? I suggest his own Personal Odyssey.This was good in targeting Sowell Economics study and progression. But to me, it was also nearly the opposite of Sowell's writing. Thomas Sowell's writing is exquisite. Understated and exact at the same time as it eliminates all dual definition and subjective equivocation. And this was nearly the opposite. The author is very smart, for sure. But he doesn't have the Sowell gift for expression toward the core immediate. Way too many sidebars and run arounds.As an aside- I read the hard cover copy which is not listed here. This is a difficult read and you need to understand many different Economic theory schools or past group associations. I did get this nuance for this particular read. And at essence this is that from his boyhood Thomas Sowell has NEVER been influenced by the glam or prestige quotient of anything anywhere. He only went to Univ. of Chicago because he followed a mentor there during and after his PhD work. Any publication by Thomas Sowell is like a classical piece of orchestra- while this is more a 5 piece afternoon Tea ensemble. I did like to learn which Sowell's works are his own favorites.

He tends to a kind of drawn out double syllable when only one exists- and it is often strangely non-woman mewling when a woman's voice or exclamation occurs. The audio was the only form I could get through library sources, so it was not my first pick. These works of Lee Child are not apt, IMHO, made by content for the audio telling, possibly because of all the action movements. FOR ME they are much better in print.Still, I would not have given any of this material more than a 3 star reaction or rating. They are not the best Reacher. He is always the stranger but the juxtapositions in Small Wars especially (but in all 3 novellas as a whole too) didn't seem like real world possibility. How in NYC in the places they highlight throughout the entire, would there not be any human presence. Not even during Covid was that true or possible. And the case in 1989 held way too much 2010 plus connotation to all Southern aspects. The dialect of the sheriff was at times, well, off-putting.

And not taught the actual Koran and original premises of speech in Muslim beginnings or the invasions of the earliest periods. Nor the core cement of tribalism which is the key. That's just as bad as making the Crusades much later an offensive based strategy as we were lead to believe. It never was. It was an attempt to reestablish Christian land/rule for populations that had become slave fodder. The pure brutality of this 1000 year invasion/ conquering practices and wars is terrible to read. Against your own family too at times which is beyond my cognitive ability to understand. But I do recommend reading it. The quotes (100's) are worth the read alone. I did know Islam meant ""submit"". I didn't really understand what that curtailed and contained in the process or viability to ""submission"" of afterwards. Although I read the Koran about 25 years ago- I understand the jihad and the core of belief (especially if there is no true practicing and only the required words repeated) now much better.My professor back in the early 1990's had his tires slashed and car robbed (Community College parking lot) and ruined for teaching the Koran's directives.

Sarcasm coupled with body function humor can only go so far with me. Too much becomes slapstick juvenile overflow dressing. Like a great salad with one gloating and dense thick ingredient drowning the whole until one next mouthful becomes sickening.Loved the N.J. mixes of groups designated and the suburban mores flows. But not so much of the inherent stereotyping of judgments parsed in some of the ways that were nuance inferred or implied. But that is author's choice and didn't really effect rating. Some were funny. Some not so much. For instance, in my suburbia- every single racial or ethnic group is at the gun range. Not a one hates the gun club entity either. Black and Asian ethnic predominate actually there. Too much of that type of continual bottom lining to reality of the present to ""all""=real or reality here. Certainly vast stereotyping predominates. Generalizing became disgusting at points.What really centered making this less than a fun read for me was both the plotting curve and the heavy language spoken to Jeff in front of their kids. Ugh! All my laughs stopped. Flawed both but that role modeling is destructive. What a self-described dichotomy too. No one of such hubris about their own smartness and superior intellect gets pregnant by ""accident"" more than 3 times. Let alone 5. And there is not a path to Andrea's assurances re the evidence finds several times too. Many other avenues could have had play. Like land contamination knowledge or other past liabilities of use to title. To tell more would be spoilers.The plot also held some flaws. That many people (any group over 3) can never hold tight mouths for 50 years. It's impossible. That has been studied too. Doesn't occur unless 4 or 5 are dead within 5 years.Regardless there was some extremely specific and memorable scenes in this entertaining tale. At least two or three of them. The picture posited of that pee/ urination hold being one. This will be VERY popular as it plays full boat with blame game times too. And the toilet and lowlife humor fans, as well. Most likely that I will not be drawn to another of his. Too many arrogant. Too many rude, selfish. And almost entirely soulless. And funny that becomes not in short order. Very quickly.

And I'll leave it for you to read and find each of the 5 stars. Structure is very odd in this book as there is not a good way to tell this century length tale but by telling it inside out. Unlike Elie Wiesel or Viktor Frankl who published works of theirs- this tale is actually the much more common course- being written to be discovered only after death. It's the survivor himself/herself who most often closes the door on that entire period, life and happenstance for many, many decades after the facts of worst punctures. He wrote his particular journey details in a 1992 period when his brother, best friend and nephew all died within a two week period and Hans was so devastated he could plunge into a recollection of the pit era. But only on paper.Ariana didn't even know she was Jewish or existence of many cousins and relatives on 3 other continents. She was raised in Caracas, Venezuela. Her Father lead an intrepid life after WWII's end and she was born from his middle wife after her Father was 50. She's left a box that held the beginnings for a search he left her as part of a more extended legacy. This (surrounding book)is all that she finds in the leads he puts her to task upon. I'm old. Every survivor of any horrific event I have ever known personally has been like Hans- closing all the emotional doors to a victimhood role. The Holocaust survivors of camps that I have known all did similar. As have every War participant or violent upheaval period person.Days later I'm still thinking about Lothar, Hans, Zdenka. How do you literally put your life on the line every single day to save others, give up your entire legacy and financial goods in the world to marry under such conditions- and then leave this spouse for another guy on a whim 6 or 7 years later?

Just picked it from the flyleaf and hardcopy cover. And because the late 19th century Chicago was the core time period. If you don't want to know anything about the book's subject- don't read this reaction. I never give synopsis. Never. But my reaction can't hide what Black means in the copy. Not what I thought it meant at all.The first Part was nearly 4 stars, Part 2 was 2.5 stars, and Part 3 was less than 2. The entire book was too long and the writing absolutely deteriorated itself as the crimes increased. It was if all the prose skills to flow and placement and description all fell in the first 1/2 of the book. With the same words used in 100's of repetitions for actions or patterns or cellar location criteria being repeated. To the point that I sped read the last 80 pages of the book. It was just more gore and slice with Nellie being a turnip about it.The premise could have been done with far, far more skill to consciousness or any type of psychological insight but the enabling one which it used. Nellie's sections were good too at the beginning. From the time of that confession by Myrtle on- she was nothing but a repeat enabler. Her own story become nil at that- except for her constantly repeated back ache and infirmities redundancies.If this was edited to 1/2 it's length or given a much more historic view of Chicago and Northern Indiana during that period- it could have been an early Stephen King. Before he got both woke and hackneyed with poor quip story lines. Within a tension stretched beyond belief for those last Bella's 8 or 10 years too. Instead it became a ridiculous cartoon baddie supreme exercise. Not even written well. WHERE WERE THE EDITORS?Is this chick lit? At the first 1/2 I thought it was- but that genre is usually filled with stereotypes of good, conflicted, honorable, preserving women who emote and effuse endlessly. This is not. In fact, the opposite and at the 100 page mark I would say she was even intriguing. But no- it's just another stereotype of the ""anti"" variety after all.Usually I find one serendipity month read that is of the first sort if it happens to be a ""woman's read"" book. And mostly they core the more common stereotypes. And depending upon the writing skill I might actually enjoy most of it. But here, this is exactly why I do the one month serendipity thing. If I knew the subject matter I wouldn't have read it. And I am glad I did read most in slow pattern to nuance too. Because this is a bit of a departure- as I believe horror or true crime is morphing a bit when it crosses women's easy read fiction. There doesn't seem to be a bottom feeder level that is not fully deported to grabbing readers now. Not only within sexual mores either.If you want a very good book about a serial killer of this period- read The Devil in the White City by Erik Larson. This book by Bruce also did Chicago no justice. It was probably the very best or close to the best place in the entire world for innovation, growth and discovery (especially in the food and automation for process and distribution discoveries) and the most rapid rise for immigrants all across the boards in the first 30 years after the Big Fire (1871) and this didn't begin to grab even a tiny portion of that reality it could have. With only about 5 pages given to the Fair? Opportunity MISSED. Too bad. It could have been an excellent book.

Not cat, not dog (although I have had dogs)- but a bird person. I would LOVE to meet that Dr. Burkett (the Avian doctor vet here). My Vet loves birds and has quite a high skill with them too, but not as specialized as Dr. Burkett is. You haven't lived until you've seen a cockatiel with an IV? I know how weird it is but we are out there. Some places in masses with the parrots. And Sean Flynn knows too- if they look sick they are FAR sicker. Birds hide it WELL. They have to.This is memoir and for a time near the 1/3rd or so point I thought it was more about him and his family than the peacocks. But it is truly about both topics. He travels much for his news job and by including all the Peacocks fame places! That was beyond enthralling. Especially the Lanes near LA where they have the peacock serial murderer. But it's about, at core, those things in life that are done just for the doing. No specific purposes and tremendous amounts of effort and cost, but ""just because"". Most people do understand that and also how those ""liking"" foibles make people so core differing from each other. Every chance I see peafowl now I will be observing their conditions and actions in a far deeper manner. I see them strutting around Brookfield Zoo (they are left out in the open areas and used to be often by the big pond that held so many flamingos)- at least once or twice a year. It was nearly a 5 star read by the ending. Not because of the humor or the serendipity of his tasks or outcomes either. In fact, I disagree pretty much. Definitely holding a fairly strong and nearly opposite set of equivocations for both his parenting explanations to his boys and some of his decisions with the birds themselves. But then I don't have peacocks. He should absolutely have known far more about them, their habits, their feed, their apt surroundings before the facts of owning them or constructing their protections. Chickens as pets make me sad.

Dozens upon dozens. It reminded me of how kids will be (maybe not any more come to think of it) fascinated by calling each other Fart Face or such for periods before they are 10.

Until page 244, I didn't have the least positing to the real perp. And the politico of big city to township cabals took over my Lu concern. That's the type of diversion and illusion Agatha did so well. And this one in this locale and with these sets of hospital, policing, neighborhood ""friends"" scenarios!

It would be on a par with the Montalbano police station in Sicily that was done so perfectly in that film series. Strongly recommend if you are a mystery, procedural, police who-dun-it buff.

Cork of 12 years at the beginning of this overlong rendition. Taking a finish/ epilogue about 2 years later.Loving the stand alone novels by Krueger so much more than this I'm going to take a day or so to ponder thoughts before I express them. It's a poignant portrayal and yet extremely morose. Other characters feel far more real or in any sense authentic to the place and era than do the O'Connors.I've decided to elaborate much more about plotting (weak motives) and character developments. The heavy handedness to parsing people in race/politico is far more 2020 than 1963 in this writing. And I have the exact problem with this voice of Lightening Strike as I do with the latest one or two Cork series novels. Preach /teach is literally half the copy word count. And the O'Connors as a family are totally and completely humorless within them too. Also hypocritical by parts as having some practice of religion but absolutely no heart of the faith or beliefs it encompasses. And I have a total repulsion on Grandma Delsey in all of these that's elemental. The baggage of mood and word she hands out with cordial care is nearly child abuse, IMHO. As is her judgments of people solely by origin and not at all by actions except in some method of looking back afterwards. Thank God, that all my own ancestors that wandered half or 3/4ths of a world from their homes and never got to return did not press retributions into me for their complete and almost total identity losses. Nor instill sameness and being illiterate and separate as any kind of model. Even if they were illiterate and victims themselves until the day they died. Early too- across the boards.Manydeeds was a great character and Henry has some good moments. Liam talks like a sausage at times and the parental units of Cork were not at all 1963 in consequences of lying, disobedience. Cork went from acting about 10 to acting 42. I considered giving this 2 stars. But Iron Lake and the Spider Creek were too real, despite many other aspects not coming close.My best friend of my entire life for almost all of it was born and raised in Hibbing, MN.

It's not exactly what I expected but it is a full 3.5 stars. Written rather dry and at times seems much more the oldest sister's story than Asad's. But the title does core the family's quest. There are political assumptions and judgments made by the author that are skewed but in the position of this split to length extent family, I can understand somewhat. Regardless there is wrong cause/effect information. And still, getting into Princeton and much else of the outcomes for Asad wouldn't have occurred in such a narrow bias as often cores comments or the ""eyes"" of the author. If any or all of those assumptions had any truth. What they seem to suggest? In fact of initiation or outcome, it's the opposite.Asad's incredible stamina and refusals to take so many wrong path choices that were continually there are pure 5 star. Others say this is a book they couldn't put down. I've read many, many scores of refugee or immigrant under stress memoirs and this was one I could put down. At points the sister's inputs were confusing and for me voided too much of her years in the USA in her enquiries from the USA end. Asad's diligence is inspiring and remarkable throughout. As is Maryan supporting them with money sent, that is exactly what great majority of immigrants do for the people they have left behind. I know many Eastern European and Mideastern or Asian 1st generation people who send 1/2 their money earned back to their origins.The same thing happens every day where I live as happened to that family who was taken ""off"" lists mysteriously to provide transport and placements from that camp. You better not irk or negate in any way the straw bosses of bureaucracy in local government or authority stations. Just like that idiot who always erased this family because the younger girl wouldn't cozy up to him or marry- entire families get scrapped off jobs or street repair or many other prime living aspects of their lives just because some peon in the elite hierarchy gets excluding with tribal or personal reasons, exactly like that. Chicago is worse in this aspect now than it was in Al Capone's day.The Father of this family had offspring with several other women and they have not gotten deportation. It seems to me that the countries around the exiles should be able to take and help them far, far more than they do. Greece has camps where people have lived for decades and in which they can't at all integrate due to endless economic, religious and other clashing reasons of finite resources. It's not an easy or doable situation that many people totally assume this is.These camps are filthy and yet there ARE proportions of these people who don't live all that differently in their home states either. Water, housing, food with nutrient values- all are insufficient.

It is definitely not his best book and on the second tier for sure. BUT, it also puts the year 2000 plus loyalty or sexual morals in a limelight of a certain sort. And the younger people will NOT like this book at all, in my opinion. Because it has a certain slant to some brands of feminism/feminist freedoms criteria that is going to jar BIGTIME for or with them.Regardless, it is also repetitious and so repeating to mood and ambiance within the first half that the current attention span is not going to jive with that either. But it DOES have a prime premise, IMHO. And one that I wished was addressed or analyzed far more often.So I have to round it up. Although it went round the bend for the last quarter of the book. And also all the dozens of book, movie, poetry name drops drove me mad. Those are one or two star features for me, even if I know the criteria.I'm old and I figured out the entire island set up (correctly to a T too) within 2 pages of Abigail's first conversation with Jill. (I think this is just exactly at the end of the first half.) Too many coincidences like that in a place so weird? Sure, you'd have to be a moron to believe that could happen. So I have to admit that this book was probably a different read for me than it was for those who have many sexual partners by the age of 25 or who live within that kind of sexual ""norm"" or ethics brand of yardsticks as most of the people who are characters in this book do. And don't EVER FORGET either that men were always as slutty as this. Always banded for raids just for these purposes, as well. Even in hunter-gatherer cultures or Neolithic farmer periods. In the reproduction and pecking order games they also have a lot less to lose.Most mothers of boys who are now men know that males can get hurt by infidelity as much as women can. FOR SURE. Or have longer term effects on a more difficult par. The less you know about this book before you read it the better the read will be. Do not read all these synopsis s. If you don't like to read any sexual content descriptions do NOT read this book.I'm not a big fan for any of that in the majority of books I've read but in this case they were not gratuitous but core/prime to the whole novel- a vile situation of reprisals.

This kind of depth to obsession highlights is never helped by such 1000 irrelevant minutia of redundancies and very little else. Marian Graves didn't feel real to me at all- not even after all these pages. She read stilted into her pilot's obsession and selfish nearly to all other connections entirely.

This is a book in its core that is for the most erudite of that field, IMHO. It taught me a lot and also infused much that I knew from other lines of study to physics and physical or astronomical fields too. Especially how weather science is computed or how climate is studied in 100's of terms I never knew. And also the IPCC and all the other organizations who hype the warmth and drought trend hysteria. Or have all these sea level warnings etc. as part of their reporting re ""climate"". The earth's albedo (sun reflection term that can be measured off of surfaces)- was the most intriguing thing I learned from this book read. Changing any degree of that could be far, far more cause/effect/outcome than most other factors. It seems that way to me. Weather control always has its huge downsides too. Even cloud seeding does.The entire PART 2 of the book is THE RESPONSE because you have to fix what is broken, not just use vast rhetoric about issues that are not even part of the whole picture and are political. He has alternatives to this, as well. C02 doesn't even seem to be a strongly determinant factor as far as I can see after reading all of this. The charting on sea levels, rainfalls, snow etc.- plus hurricane lies and much else listed as ""true"" in our current media were just some of the interesting parts of this book. A whole picture that has 1000's of inputs and for which the Earth has gone through many, many times before in great numbers of those inputs. C02 has been in huge proportion larger in our atmosphere in past ages than it is now.But the best part of this book was not the geography or mappings or graphs or all the definitions explained but in the second part of this title. WHAT CLIMATE SCIENCE TELLS US, WHAT IT DOESN'T, AND WHY IT MATTERSIf you want to take this book on, you'd better get all your math and science skill eyes and brain cells working full time. It is not easy to digest the 100's of inputs or outputs equivalencies alone- let alone to follow all his studies for dozens and dozens of world science groups and their true interpretations of who or what they interpret and who for, as well. It's probably the hardest book to digest that I've read in at least 10 years.

It's not perfect but for the length it is apt. Longer and it would have had to include all kinds of historic and nomenclature data of particulars (like the exact origin group or individual for a language or a migration origin etc.). Doing all of that designating to exact degree would have made the book nearly unreadable, and certainly less understandable to those whose do not know much base information upon the overall subject. Because it cores on the Old Europe origins of humans who resided in that particular location, it is even more narrowed to a scale that can be more easily digested and also frames the larger continental pictures. This was a great way to access information for various lines of homo that were never included in other studies that I myself have had in former schooling of other decades. And I must add, that some of this (probably more than 1/2) is NOT what was taught to us or understood as possible either back in the 1960's or 1980's. Not even in the years up to 2000. The entire field ""eyes"" have changed. Because climate changes, geography changes, access to continents and plains change. And also because what is ""true"" about Homo Sapiens observing today was and is not always the case for a hunter gather vs Neolithic farmer scenario. The language chapter was beyond my comprehension, I don't know enough about the originals, the intermediates, or any of the existing oddballs today. But other than that I could with a very slow read understand most of this. And also why so many ""true"" absolutes of my youth and middle age science are virtually just NOT. I almost gave it 3 stars for his assumptions in the last 20 pages of the book. Some of them were absurd and he should NOT interpret the politico. Neither author should. Their German European cognition is showing and holds a more than miniscule set of ""knowing what they know"". When at times they just don't have a clue about what they don't know.I would recommend this book if you ever had interest in different homo forms or you are well into interest for the various DNA of past ancestry that can be now evaluated as these authors did. Excellently too. Using various degrees of gene sequence and other newer methods of comparing same to same or differences or with huge input from the mitrochondrial DNA portions that have come down from millennia maternal lines. Also interesting to those who study and interpret patriarchy? The DNA tells the tale. Almost all men stayed in one locale and almost all women married or were sent ""out"" to other locales. A lot of your perceived cultural differences are seated in the biology of not only the farming or ""stay put"" life either. Usually I disapprove of taking such a wide non-fiction subject into a single study volume. But this one is defined and exceptional for its organization to fields of comparison/competition (like bacteria and virus developing at the same times). And I do disagree with the other s which say that more specific tribal names, origin places or exact designation to type should have been listed if known and proven already in 2020. That would have made this overview nearly impossible to digest. So many people, so many diseases, so many entire populations decimations.

I cannot round it up as the plot and the Reacher development doesn't earn it. Don't get me wrong though, this is OODLES better than Blue Moon. That was a Reacher from another cloning or bizarko world version. I almost didn't read this Sentinel at all early and came to it very late because of the direction the series was going. Joint authorship or not, just from that former product I have waited until it was out to see the marks it got. This is highly unusual for me to do that on a series for which I have read the entire.This one centers on a tech ransom ware cabal and viscous spies and assassins group given politico leanings of assumption that were also as dicey as they were. Many of the aspects I thought rather cheesy on top of it. Like the codes Reacher broke and the birthdays used. This generation wouldn't even know those dates. Or much of anything realistic about Nazis or any of the Stalinists or pre-Stalinists either. But it was back to protecting the innocent that are assumed guilty at least. And defending the weak party or clearly sighted victim. And yet, the Reacher that was legend still seems far more into gratuitous extras of baiting and maiming than he was. More arrogant too. Not the same as in the prime books of this series with Lee Child the only author. Not at all.Overall, it took me days in between to return to this book too. So many comings and goings with Rusty being a sideline only for most of it. Also Rule serendipity added at the end was more creepy than romantic or sexy. Reacher doesn't return to former directions he goes ONWARDS.

It is filled with detailed maps upon each of the 3 journeys. They helped me understand the various logistics immensely and they were 5 stars.Overall I think this non-fiction study of the explorations by Berants from these last years of the 16 century was a full 4 stars. But that doesn't mean that reading it was a clear flow. There are 100's of minutia details about people, history of their emerging nations (especially the Dutch) and other navigating criteria per section. So to understand even portions of their goals and context mindset upon ships meetings and various time spans is difficult in the extreme. This book took me about 5 times longer to do for its length than an ""average"" non-fiction read for me.The challenge was worth the effort. I knew about other explorers far, far more than this era, far North location, or this crew. I can't imagine the intrepid factors or bravery in their records. With such lacks of knowledge in not only location and distances but in ""normal"" weather patterns. But I did get real sick of reading about polar bear attacks and killing various species with/while a shipmate was being eaten. And also the clothing! I can't imagine wearing such clothes in this environment. Be warned- the violence to survive and dominate is HERE. Sami descriptions to real quoted copy- it's harsh reading.There are some remarks at the end of this book that I have researched and which are slanted- not at all entirely correct. A recent ship reality, just within the last 2 to 3 years of icebound disasters have occurred. Not only in this region either. This book will not be for most 2021 readers, IMHO. The sensibilities are not close to the period we live within now. But you can very well comprehend why, how the Dutch created an economic and world dominate hegemony following this exact period.

I couldn't round it up because of what was NOT included in this book. And that is the wide spread of other eugenics theory and practice at the times of these centuries. It includes several, maybe all, that back one slanted (IMHO) theory (2020/21 era perceptions)to the role eugenics played without giving you the wider medical practice states and picture of the reality of those times. Also it rather conflates the issue to bad/bad in one sense and ""not so bad"" in the others as to birth control and abortion. Which mostly arising from eugenics enthusiasts and movements such as Sanger led. And how that plays out now with the racial balance of aborted babies in 2021 so skewed too. That reality of data is very relevant to this topic. Essentially so.What about how /why/ for most entire medical practices of all kinds- were doctors given authority to operate? I believe in this guise you need to relate that wider context. Doctors had far more leeway in all kinds of life altering treatments then, not just on the OB/GYN. All practice pressured or performed at these times is assumed by the author to be race or class based or for convenience of the family person in power (like that gold digger mother). It wasn't. And even in my own lifetime it was common practice not to tell a patient the most dire news they could hear. So many, many scenarios played out in treatments and in placements that were NOT of the patient choice or knowledge. Most cancer deaths I knew before I was 40 years old myself- those people were never told they had cancer.Mental illness operations and ""cures"" etc. etc. Yes, eugenics also focused on going ""toward"" a better supposed future, but it also was done with supposedly empathetic and supportive ""feeling"" proponents.

Nothing could be truer.""Sicily is the largest island in the Mediterranean Sea, occupied over the centuries by Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Normans, and Vandals. Sicilian locals have survived this history of intrusion and subjugation by forming an extremely tight-knit society. Outsiders are not welcome. The warm climate and simple agricultural lifestyle of the island hides the fact that little about daily life in Sicily is known to anyone but those who actually live there.""O'Reilly writes in that present tense romping style.

Good information all around and lets you fully know how much of Mafia business and growth was, IMHO, allowed and sustained by our own get along to go along for their own purposes 20th candidates/ elected politicians. Not to speak of unions and their bosses too. JFK was probably set up as he was because he didn't want to play ball with some issues of blind eye and Robert was mixing where he shouldn't. O'Reilly doesn't believe this. I've read enough to doubt that O'Reilly is correct on that one. Oswald was aided in more ways than through Russian operatives, if only by the absence of the usual protective ""eyes"" to the prizes that would notice and ""be there"".But O'Reilly always gives excellent information of afterwards in his footnotes and asides too- which let you know the principle prime characters' ""answers"" or ""outcome replies to accusations in real time"". I like that here- its form is opinion where opinion belongs within a published history. And yet gives a voice to the core personality of the exact situation/ time to speak for themselves. The rest is event reality and process of real life dates etc. And not at all much ""interpretive"" as our present slanted bias news constantly is.

But, and this is a big BUT- these people are very good intent people but don't seem bright or savvy or joyful or much of anything but morose and thoughtful. And absolutely Godless. Sad mounted on sad. It's the exact period I remember well in another place. Being about 2 years older than Bernie here. Where is all the alcohol and partying adults? Honestly without tv or tech- or much of anything but radio- people had TONS more joy. Even those of us who had 94 year old Grandma's sitting crying on the stairs because it was storming out. (She was terrified of lightening from her childhood for good reasons.) I had to force myself to return to this book- my connections were just nil. Where were their Lone Ranger and Tonto (and YES Black kids had them too) outfits. Or their Davy Crocket hats. Even Red Rover is made into a negative experience. I would classify this book as closely bordering chick lit if not right there. You know the people but little else but some life motivations and it's all effusive cored. People took care of old people then themselves. Families like mine still do. The s on this make it seem like this family is exceptional saints. No, it was absolutely norm. Special needs or whatever shape you were in- we all tended to live with it. Literally. All in shared bedrooms too. Every family of 48 houses on my block did. Mindless or polio victims immobile or disabled or hearing deaf (she was my best friend for some years)- you name it. They weren't categorized either. Everybody watched out for their proclivities too. This sounds outlier extreme or that I disliked the book. It's not meant to be that at all. I am just shocked at the ratings on this one. Stolid, morose and at times backwards as an ideal or font of high interest lesson or example. Especially upon the world events insertions and reactions. You should have been there when they were happening to you personally. Like getting your work or stores or own apartment building block burnt down. Or having to put your life and limb at risk just to get to your college class or second job. Often not making it. A couple times hospital trips instead without even telling your parents because then you wouldn't be able to continue with schooling.This does not seem at all real time period to me after about the first quarter of the book, except for the young father's heart attack death. Especially because of how many veterans of war surrounded me my first 20 years- this is SO different in reactions. Grief was much more personal. And the veterans of every ability or not, they never spent hours brooding and insular as this period portrays occasional aftermath here. Bullet bras were more accurate aspects. And high-balls or Seven Sevens. Where is the ""get to the Moon"" spirit and inspiration?Good Lord there had to be a place in Maine similar to this, I guess.

But also on the differences between disabilities labeling in general and/or chronic disease. Most especially of a life-long condition. It's not as much a memoir, as opposed to a self-help or informational study of those who suffer and the people who care for them. Doctors, family, friends, society- all. Not more than 1/2 is memoir. Possibly even less than half.I found the listings of 30 plus sufferers near the very ending- inspiring. They each gave a paragraph or two on what makes them happy or peaceful or content on their bad days. I'm glad she added that portion. Not everyone deals with such nearly endless pain or doctoring in the same ways. I've seen that in full boat my whole life. Crohn's Disease, all varieties of ulcerative or bowel diseases, heart conditions that change with body position, lupus and the arthritis conditions of every ilk for muscle/ bone are heavy physical fallouts to energy needed for a ""regular"" life. Not to speak of pain or properties of having many RX fallouts. So being in touch CONSTANTLY with one's own body is prime. She gives emphasis to this reality well.She has/ holds enough negatives in this book to pave a road to the moon. And she pontificates about many issues to the point of what? Some I can understand like about questions friends or peers or workmates ask. (Which she believes are not helpful, are nosy, make her feel offended etc. etc.) But I am completely sure others with the same degrees of illness don't all feel the same as Tessa does about most of these categories of questions. She stereotypes immensely (all the people from the Midwestern USA are messed up etc.) and has the opinion that every nuance or degree of emotional mental illness needs the therapy of an analyst or degree of psychological counseling mentor. Her definitions of these and many (most) terms for different medical conditions, specialties, terms for levels of psychology etc. are listed in a section near the ending as well. Many of her assumptions and judgments are completely Tessa's. Some are truly mind-boggling in their generic stereotyping negativity. Some of them are so extremely bitter in their nuance. Especially in her indictments to the American Health Care System. She can list every negative and picks and chooses all of those slants which support her opinion. She especially disses all rural doctors or hospital systems full boat. I would suggest she not go on vacations to other continents EVER.Crohn's and digestive system conditions, along with many asthma, muscle or joint or immune system diseases are truly devastating. And can also exist for entire lifetimes into advanced old ages.

Every one I knew was used up, got sick- or was thrown away for age or weight or some other hierarchy squabble.

Beyond the detail of these medical cases, it also holds the very accurate descriptions of mood swings and obscure and blatant manipulations (both) that Kristin Gilbert had cored, not just then, but nearly throughout her entire lifespan up until then.This is also a tremendous explicit example of bureaucracy in massive and governmental hierarchies within systems that are MUCH better controlled and operated at local levels. When something is ""off"" it just takes too long to fix it. And there are too many levels of authority to do so even when the exact causes are determined. It's no coincidence that she got so far down the murder count line at a Veteran's Administration hospital.True life heroes are the three nurses who came forward with witness and physical proof. Their own lives were censured and impugned from the very first of secret off hospital meeting to this very day. One has died but the other two will have consequence until their own last days for being protective and honest as they were. Difficult to impossible onus was put on their shoulders and they faced it squarely. Without such people watching and evaluating and reporting realities of operation/ data- we are as humans just evil dominated lost. Not only in hospital, law, industry, transport or any physical reality truth either. People have got to believe their own eyes and not media or reports from on high. (This is especially true about the state of our own bridges in many Mid-Western states.)Medical serial killers are the most prolific. People are just about defenseless within this scenario of manipulative control. It isn't at all a fluke that she did the in/out mental facility as a patient herself so many times in her young life. Or that she ended up being originally indicted for something different than the murders or attempted murders. The coverage of the police and prosecutors was most excellent on this one too.

He's not a highly organized writer or is the prose always smooth and easy to understand. But neither is anything about these groups of criminals either. Nor the teams of lawful side that fingered so many. Brutal and dominating to all others lives. And outfits intertwined or of high complexity even to each other. With roles, once formed or played out- there was no refusals or going ""away"" from any compliances within any time limits of afterwards. Including murdering and dumping best friends as a required task.Knowing all the spots as they were then in the locales in which they most occurred- it was more interesting to me than it would be for the common reader. The sheer numbers of names with association are hard to convey. In comic portrayals or in photo- dozens and dozens.In this exact era I had read and heard 1st hand from witness about the numbers of bodies being dumped in Chinatown or close to what was then Comiskey Park(or at least the wider area around it beyond the projects and into Bridgeport). And because I had heard I always asked people (numbers of them) not to go to eat in Chinatown at night. And I remember clearly one friend getting very hostile and losing that friend. I knew how dangerous it would be to be witness or just be at the wrong place at the wrong time. I was right and at one time it was the most dangerous area in Chicago- without exception. Not now. At all. That area has been gentrified quite far all around and way into Canaryville. Far worse areas exist presently. For murders and crime both. The last time I looked there were 154 gangs listed within the Chicagoland area. With 100's and 100's of murders on their plates. Mostly to each other but more often than in this Chicago Mob epoch, against innocent bystanders or just people who saw too much. The area where I was born and where I lived my early life is one of them- Englewood.I would not recommend this book unless you are in perceptions of law and highly intersected methods of these criminal practices- as a Criminal Justice or Law student. It's nearly impossible to read for those who have little context. It was a most difficult read for me in just the various two, three or four names each of dozens of players had/have. Now with phone calls and location tracings- quite apart from all the forensics biologic proofs, I do believe it is easier to prosecute/indict. Not easier to keep any murderer in prison so it doesn't go into multiple repeats of the crimes though. Harder now. It isn't at all unusual. Nor for the 3 or 5 time murderer to be murdered himself or herself in eventual releases.There are worse cities for this. Hard to believe?

Maybe in the last 2 or 3 years! 4.5 stars in the surround of eyes and perceptions to this family and these people. Mainly those in the Yoder and Conley families- but especially Mary and Bill Yoder within their Chiropractic Clinic and out of it.As much as I considered giving this a 5 star rating, the juxtaposition of at least 20 time flips and locale switches kept me from doing so. But the more I think about it, I doubt this could be at all told well if you didn't have HUGE context to the 5 years prior to Mary Yoder's murder. The title is totally accurate. Everyone thought they knew her. How do you not trust work mates or family associates of years' practice? Is what you see, what you get.Having seen the Dateline program on this case- the book is just eons better. It put you into the 2 different ""couples"" here in very much a psychological sense and not just a relationship dynamic. Very unusual in any print copy, IMHO. The married Yoders and Adam (their son) and his off and on again girlfriend, Katie. You don't just get the reality of structures but the inherent core outlook and outcome personality bents to the MAX.Bill Yoder is so essentially about Bill Yoder from his teen years to his 70's. It's all in the now and fulfillments for him. Mary is feeling and energy. Neither of them are economic or essential practical applications cored. Not at all. Hobbies, fun of physical and mental, job joy and in some ways nurturing all trump the essentially rote. Adam, their son- definitely inherits many of his Dad's emotional highs and effusive moods. Plus the bottoms and self-identity core issues on top of it. Mid-twenties and still parsing all about himself. And Katie.Well, you read the book. I've since gotten a list of Phelps' work and put interlibrary loans for almost all of them. Dozen or more. His psychological analysis is 5 stars. He doesn't need to give them DSM-5 designations either. What they are is enough. Personality disorders in good and normal folks. And personality disorders in not so good or normal folks. Which is which??Photos were excellent. They did give you intense aura that surrounded Mary. Gardening, pottery, and chiropractic hugs. You wouldn't ever find her in the kitchen.

This was one. It's actually very close to a full 4 star, but the last 3 have been so outstanding that I couldn't round it up. Not only in the discussions with the older now teenage kids at dinner, but in other aspects here- Guido is parsing and positing what is the huge fallacy again and again in their thinking, argument, government process etc. BUT, to me there is a big but here. Guido is a stern lawful and always staunch supporter of both reality and appropriate consequences for not only law breaking and/or evil actions, but also for the double sided hypocrisies in words that shield them. And here, he just, IMHO, doesn't square that judgment (of his daughter's attitude especially) with enough of the true data. Rhetoric is nice. Tallus quoting superb to counter it! But at times, it should be the exposure of the nitty-gritty TO the ignorant that should also not be omitted. This is about corruption. And also prejudice. Done with a very, very light hand and immense intellectual and historic support from literature, surroundings of the past etc. And I super, super appreciate Leon's taking this one on. Perhaps she should get the 4th star just for that alone. Yes, I think I will change it. 3.5 stars- rounded up for the Guido Brunetti going fully around the crux in the road that will expose possibly more than his employers or even his own culture would wont him to do. And essentially far more than Paola would fane to desire. She is left speechless. Really.Leon gets her stabs at religion and the Church in particular in there too. More than the 1 or 2 spot average in each book of NOW HAVING HIT THE #30 mark. Guido does some excellent acting in this one. He plays a kind of Columbo role (with cast off clothing and the same stained trench coat) in order to get his Venezia dialect and idiot bureaucratic bumbler questions answered. This one has huge maritime aspects- those were 5 star. We are on the canals constantly and also have many eyes of boat/ ship workers and drivers, in both the laguna and in the Adriatic. Foa is excellent as always. Claudia Griffoni is full blown prime character center in this one. She plays the Napoli vulgar fawning former street urchin with full sway and accent too to get access in this one.There were certain aspects of this, especially to her association job seeking patterns, that I wish Leon could have done much better. But then I am from Chicago and know much more than she does about that, most probably. Corruption with all its lowly step-sisters. Each with birthing illegitimate offspring bureaucracies each and every year. (Is there another sticker or stamp or toll card or whatever new again this year? Of course, there is.) Do working people get decimated in time and in funds just BECAUSE they work. Of course, they do.Real slavery exists. Today. On every continent. Is this book anti-woke? Partially, but never as strongly as I would have wished it to be. Especially not in regards to sex trafficking and movements from one country to another as being ""refugee"" or some other category when they are absolutely not that at all.All hail Donna Leon! As much as I read, she is the only author I can absolutely say got to number 30 in a series without one stinker in the midst. Not even close. And there were at least 3 perfect 5's in there too, with immense substance to them. Beyond the cultural beauty and core of hubris so Venizia well earned.And who has aged and advanced in context every single aspect of the characters AND the place in which they live too. In every one of these 30 books, people are core real too. They age and they change. And they also gather grief and broken pieces exactly as humans who live long periods do.In this one she comments several times about Venice. During Covid the tourist trade has imploded on top of all the rest of the tragedy. She states well that the natives got their worst wish granted. Fewer on the bridges etc. She says you can count the people in San Marco standing in one place in a minute. And that the decades length reconstruction of San Lorenzo is completed. No longer a church but a type of gallery, museum. The sadness of change is EMBEDDED in this one. You can taste it.Be happy before you start this book. It is exceptionally melancholy. And the core that binds the entire book is friendship. And how friendships of great length are altered over long decades time. Especially man to man friendships from boyhood. All kinds.

And lie detector test on people who do not read, nor write, nor know what a blood pressure cuff or sensory appliance put on a chest could begin to ""measure"" in their own cognitions.The photo in my mind of those two girls hanging from that tree. By their draped clothing, scarves. And their shoes neatly lined up in pairs at the base of the tree? Do kidnappers and rapists do that?I very much doubt they committed suicide. Nor that they were kidnapped and raped. Look who changed their stories the most. The Dads and the Uncles and the Cousins. Honor killing, I'm about 75% sure. Can you imagine having the ""sweeper"" of the back storeroom doing the autopsies! Or that he had never even worked in a medical setting or been witness to one with a doctor performing it. Or that all of the police involved in the beginnings of search were drunk and/or abusive to anyone who deemed to knock on their gate? Or the level of criminal corruption in daily view too- like the sand mafia. Oh, so many people know what happened but aren't telling and never will. That's just about the only feature that is completely obvious. But that photo in my mind of those mothers and grandmother sitting under that mango tree and not letting them take the dead bodies down for all that time in that HEAT! Protest yes and purposeful yet. BUT! Also protecting others. Always.

Her style pulls the narrative to intensity pitch after a slow and wordy/erudite start which is highly deceiving both in category (mystery/whodunit) and pace. Yet the carved and nervous tenseness arrives much earlier full strength than in other novels or works of this sort. Here she nails attitude, IQ brilliance of overlook, and essential parts of their emotional cognition to a 5 star degree in at least 4 characters. This is a supremely dark book. Let me warn first. Much darker than the first 60 pages would lead you to warrant.There is a skill here with character plummeting that translates to visuals too here- this novel will most probably be made a movie. Or even a short limited series. I would not be at all surprised.I read this over a period of about a week (that is much slower than usual) as it was busy planting time. But it gave my little grey cells time to posit about it while doing physical work. Regardless, I had a HUGE inkling by page 122-126 how this was. The who for sure and the where and how less sure. But I was right about 2 out of 3 of those prior and ""missing"" aspects. So the last parts of this book were not as loaded with shock value to me as it seems they were to others. Being old, and reading too much? Well, when an author spends so much (too much) time on certain descriptions of ambiance or nuance or physical appearance to make sense? It's a red flag (nearly a red herring in reverse) for me. What is that trying to obscure?This could easily be given a 5 star rating. The writing prose forms and switch features to another ""book novel copy"" are not too frequent or confusing of pronouns either. Like a talented illusionist performing for the staring audience, the eye or mind or emotion are diverted here repeatedly. It's done well.The author also put in a few cheap shots that were beneath her and this body of work. Not just to the politico but to the ""writing about writing"" teach and do skills. It also rather detracted from Jake's personality analysis / background/ mindset, IMHO. But that's the times we live in. They are tawdry.Only read this book if you can tolerate Godless, insipid, faithless to mankind on the whole souls. For much of it, you think it is about writing and writing skills or how people form ideas, but it is actually at a much lower scale of operations than those.Lastly, and this is a semi-spoiler if you saw the limited series The Undoing with Nicole Kidman. All the way through this book it started reminding me of that exact New York city couple, but he was a doctor, a surgeon. Well would you believe after I had finished and read the acknowledgments- I read the back leaf page. And she is the SAME author of that plot too. I don't have those channels but watched it on Watchathon week last year because it was 6 or 8 episodes, very short for such a high end series. But some part of me recognized that particular brand of intimacy ""kindness""? Well, she writes extremely dark individuals but in a very high end intellectual and world placed way. At the beginning of this read I thought this reminded me of Weight of Ink. In fact, it is almost polar opposite to that.
