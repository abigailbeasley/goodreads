Soufrière was in terrible shape when we visited (March, 2024). It looked deserted and broken, cracked windows and front doors boarded up instead of replaced. Where were the people? Where was the commerce? The book, which does in fact, read like a well-paced novel, as others have noted, provided history and context. I liked that it was written from a distinct POV — this is not a cautious and objective recitation of the facts — it’s a passionate, insider account of the troubles that generations of St. Lucians have endured and continue to endure. I thought the author’s descriptions of the intensely physical labours performed by inhabitants over the centuries — from slavery to slinging coal and farming bananas — contained a level of detail one rarely encounters in history books and which may not have been recorded in any meaningful way at all, if not for this book. Reynolds has lived the history of which he speaks, and it makes for a riveting read. He did mention that the types of tourism that is popular in St. Lucia — cruise ships and all-inclusive resorts — do not result in trickle down prosperity. I would have liked to have heard his thoughts on that subject. To be fair, tourism was not the topic of his book, which was published in 2018. I finished the book feeling like I’d had a fascinating encounter with a thoughtful, highly educated and erudite resident of the island. I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in Caribbean history or who is seeking to better understand events taking place in the Caribbean today. Haiti may be the first island nation to descend into lawlessness, but as this book makes clear, you can only keep people poor and oppressed for a finite amount of generations, even though those generations may be legion.The murder rate in St. Lucia is climbing — 39 homicides per 100,000 people a year in 2021, compared to about 2 in Canada and about 6 in the U.S. There were 75 homicides in St. Lucia in 2023.While tourists are not the target, it is hard not to see it as evidence that a new, dark chapter in the history of the island is about to be written....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Mar 22, 2024","Mar 24, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3240493-the-struggle-for-survival

The subject matter appealed to me — American wives, as did the place — Vietnam, and the time period — the 1960s. But not enough happened. Or maybe not in the right order. I feel the book may better have held my interest if it had started with the main characters being stuck in a jeep in the pouring rain, night falling as fear of a Viet Cong attack grows, and then back-tracked to how they got there. Or maybe not, because the bottom line is, not enough happened to sustain my interest over 324 pages. Example: The narrator attaches so much importance to the “you” she’s addressing that you imagine she adopted her or that they became lovers or…something. But no. Nothing really happens. They move away. The last part of the book, supposedly written by a different person of a different generation has a voice almost identical to the first narrator. McDermott is making a point with this book, I suppose. A point about our instinct to help and how it can backfire, get warped, miss the point, make things worse, and how great good can come from great evil — the dodgy surgeon who goes on to pioneer life-saving heart surgery. Morality isn’t black-and-white — even people doing good can wreak harm. And sometimes the most important things that happen in our lives aren’t big events, but relatively small ones, that loom larger as they ripple across time, across generations. These are important ideas. But I was hoping for a story....more",Notes are private!,1,1,1,not set,"Mar 21, 2024","Mar 21, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/101404407-absolution

It’s not funny. It’s barely an autobiography. But it reveals a lot about addiction, which I think was mostly Perry’sThis is not a Hollywood tell-all. It’s not funny. It’s barely an autobiography. But it reveals a lot about addiction, which I think was mostly Perry’s intent. We’ve learned a lot about addiction over the past 100 years or so, the most important being that it’s not a simple choice or moral failing — it’s a disease that takes root more firmly in some people than others — and Matthew Perry’s brain seems to be a particularly fertile breeding ground for all addictions. He was addicted to opioids, alcohol, cigarettes and probably sex, and has quit most of them for now. I’ve read many autobiographies written by people with addictions and it’s striking how many things they have in common. One is that they felt uncomfortable in their own skin and alcohol/drugs made them feel comfortable, and it was such a relief they couldn’t stop. That’s how it was for Perry. This book is a cautionary tale and also perhaps, hopefully, will give the right readers just enough courage to sign up for rehab one more time.I did find Perry’s calculated and casual use of women repellant. Apologizing profusely for being a dog doesn’t make it better. Especially since he takes care to mention repeatedly that he broke up with Julia Roberts and not the other way around, and that, despite all his womanizing only one (or two?) women ever broke up with him, or wouldn’t go out with him, including Jennifer Aniston. Smart girl.I listened to this on Audible. Perry’s voice is slurred, which makes it a bit of a tough go, and it’s too long, with too much detail, particularly at the end, about the view of the ocean and metaphors for life and healing. Too many thank-yous. Can’t you thank people privately and not involve your readers?He doesn’t come off as entirely likeable, and he’s still pretty self-focused, but if this book encourages anyone to check into rehab, or just not get involved with drugs in the first place, it will have done it’s job. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Feb 07, 2023","Feb 07, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59641216-friends-lovers-and-the-big-terrible-thing

So do child prodigies and athletes. Generally speaking, they’re giving up their one, brief **spoiler alert** Child celebrities make me uncomfortable. So do child prodigies and athletes. Generally speaking, they’re giving up their one, brief childhood to chase a dream that may or may not pan out, and if it does pan out and bring fame, we’ll, that’s not a great outcome either. It doesn’t seem worth it and shouldn’t be encouraged. I mean, maybe if it’s something they are themselves obsessed with and want — maybe — it’s okay? Maybe. Too often it seems to be something their parents want for them. That was Jennette McCurdy’s experience. At the age of six, her mother Debra began pushing her only daughter into acting, eventually making a star out of her — McCurdy landed the lead role in iCarly on Nickelodeon. Debra also introduced her daughter to extreme dieting in order to delay puberty, which triggered anorexia and then bulimia. Debra was a hoarder whose children slept on Costco mats on the living room floor, hemmed in by garbage. Three of them were the product of an affair with another man, while Debra was married to Mark, the man Jennette thought was her father — a passive retail worker whom Debra controlled with her explosive rage. It took McCurdy years to disentangle her life from her overbearing mother, and it sadly seems unlikely that she will ever be fully and truly healed — the abuse she suffered infused every nook and cranny of her life. And in L.A., stars seem hounded at every turn by predators, from overzealous fans to opportunistic real estate agents, contractors, even decorators, and leering and emotionally abusive directors. Even her attempts at recovery are fraught. Her first “therapist” quickly crosses all boundaries, persuading Jennette to take her to an awards show, for “therapeutic” reasons. The therapist ends up spending more time canoodling with stars than she does helping her client. The last chapters of the book are wrenching. McCurdy sits by her mother’s headstone, inscribed with superlatives, and is swamped by anger over who her mother really was and what she did to the people closest to her, the closest being her. McCurdy’s assessment of her mother in these pages is scathing.I actually read this book by accident. It was recommended to me, I thought, by a well-read family member. Turns out I completely messed up the title and read the wrong book entirely.I don’t regret it. Like all people who grew up with a monster in the house — someone whose moods must constantly be read accurately in order to keep all hell from breaking loose — McCurdy is an expert in reading people. Her assessments seem accurate, and even in the case of her mother, she demonstrates an underlying reflexive kindness, understanding and humanity that to me signal deep intelligence. I hope she keeps writing and that she is able to segue into other genres, and put this past as far behind her as she can. I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in Hollywood or celebrity. It should be required reading for every parent who shows up at an audition with an innocent child in tow....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jan 27, 2023","Jan 27, 2023",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/59364173-i-m-glad-my-mom-died

His happiness depends on his mom’s choice in men, which is bizarrely terrible. Together Tobias and his mother flee a string of abusive husbands and boyfriends, taking refuge in Utah, Seattle and finally a small town in Washington, where Wolff is forced to live with a step-father who loathes him. The boy takes up with a variety of dodgy friends, and engages in random pranks, any one of which could have killed him, and yet somehow survives, mostly unscathed, to mess up a new day. He steals. He lies and cheats his way into a prep school, winning the support of a school official who invests in him, but he messes that up too and gets kicked out.The story ends before we learn how the boy finally rights himself, becoming an award-winning writer and professor. This book is almost perfectly written, but there’s a curious detachment about it — a lack of emotion. It also seems truthful, at times unsparing. The blurb on the back of the 30th anniversary edition of the book, published in 2019, says: Thirty years ago Tobias Wolff wrote a memoir that changed the form. I’m not in a position to judge whether that is true, but his writing is spare — not Hemingway spare, but economical — and yet lyrical. He is a grand master of the telling detail. Some examples of Wolff’s writing: • Marian didn’t have all the goods on me, but she had enough to keep her going for a while and she put her heart into it, hitting every note she knew in my song of malfeasance.• I also condescended to Arthur and my other friends, as if they had served their purpose and were already dematerializing into quaint, vaporous memories. • Argument was the only kind of sound he knew how to make. • Knowing that everything comes to an end is a gift of experience, a consolation gift for knowing that we ourselves are coming to an end. Before we get it we live in a continuous present, and imagine the future as more of that present. Happiness is endless happiness, innocent of its own sure passing. Pain is endless pain.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a good, but not too challenging, literary read.I stormed through it in one day and I will be looking for more titles by Tobias Wolff. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Mar 18, 2023","Jan 02, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11466.This_Boy_s_Life

She’s not a bad writer, either. I mean, she was a writer of her time, so it’s stilted and sentimental to us, but she’s engaging enough, especially when compared to the few chapters her husband writes. I think this book is a valuable historical document and I’m glad I read it. I would have enjoyed more chapters about the Indigenous peoples she met, but although she gives them a chapter, she didn’t seem as deeply interested in them as she was about the various fellow immigrants who blew through their lives. They offered a lot of insight into the English class system, though, and what that was like. It’s amazing how much people helped each other in the backwoods. Basically, if someone knocked on your door, you fed them, and if they needed a place to stay, you housed them, at your own expense, even if they did not contribute in any way....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Aug 20, 2022","Aug 20, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/162862.Roughing_It_in_the_Bush

If you had to boil this book down to a sentence, that would be the message, delivered with elegance by an exceptional writer. Many have complained that this book and the writer are elitist, and while that’s true, there is a lot of wisdom in this book. It is not sentimental or self-pitying. Didion explores the experience of the sudden death of a beloved spouse, researches grief and brings us her findings. It’s also offers a lot of insight into the life of two literary giants of the 20th Century. I liked reading that she and her husband at one point lived in Brentwood and worked at home together, taking a break at 4 p.m. to putter in the garden or paddle in the pool and would then watch an episode of a BBC series on women prisoners in Malaya in WWII, work two more hours and head out to supper at Morton’s.

She was brilliant in Legally Blonde, but instead of taking off, her career sputtered and died. This book explains why and how. For one thing, she never considered herself to be a lead actress; she always thought of herself as second-string. I wonder, if she had had more belief in herself, had she loved herself more, would things have turned out differently for her? Had she been better looked after as a child; if she had held herself in higher regard, perhaps the MS that may have been present as early as childhood would have been diagnosed sooner and not caused the damage it did? If an adult had looked closely enough to see her suffering, or if she knew she didn’t deserve to be in pain, perhaps she would have insisted on getting medical treatment instead of drowning herself in alcohol to cope. One can’t help feeling sad for Blair, who comes off as personable, wry, bright, kind and forgiving. Until I read this book, I had never heard of a child choosing and pursuing alcoholism in this way. I didn’t know alcoholism could start in childhood. There are some interesting insights into life in Hollywood, a deeply weird place, but not a lot. Blair may be able to admit her disease means she can’t always make it to the bathroom in time, but she’s not giving up anyone else’s secrets. Unfortunately, this book reads more like a third draft than a finished product. It doesn’t have momentum, and is a bit disorganized. For example, the timeline shifts often and without a lot of notice, so you’re never sure if you’re reading about 19-year-old Selma or 30-year-old Blair.

Writers Ann Patchett and Lucy Grealy meet at Sarah Lawrence and form a lifelong friendship as they pursue their literary careers. Patchett is disciplined, the self-described ant of Aesop’s Fable. Grealy is the grasshopper, singing loudly throughout the summer, requiring the frequent intervention of Patchett-the-ant, in fact a whole colony of ant friends, to support her carousing and crying, writing and her painful recoveries from multiple surgeries in an attempt to reconstruct a jaw lost to childhood cancer. Sometimes they supported her financially, or by providing her with a place to live. Patchett does all this with deep and abiding love, often physically carrying Grealy. I found this book fascinating on many levels. I was interested in their journey from students to internationally acclaimed writers and the in the details of their long friendship of uncommon depth and resilience. Grealy’s sister, in an article for The Guardian, criticized Patchett for writing the book, accusing her of somehow hijacking the grief process. There was nothing of Grealy’s sisters in the book, she points out. Well, that’s not what the book was about. It was about a friendship between two women. There were times in the book — like when Patchett points out that many of Grealy’s fans were cancer survivors — that I wonder whether she was slyly trying to cut her friend down to size. But it’s also the truth. So.

I kept waiting for the events, the writing, the insights or ideas to dazzle me, but they never did. His explanation for why he believes in God is particularly weak and requires a lot more work to stand up. It’s like he couldn’t decide what he was writing. A memoir? A philosophical treatise? And I am not sure, that given more time, the result would have been significantly better. A devoted student of great literature, Kalanithi is not himself a gifted writer.

Jessica Simpson is a likeable person and reading this memoire, it’s easy to see why. She truly believes in helping others and despite her fame, beauty, wealth and talent, remains somehow vulnerable — perhaps because she has herself been a victim — of childhood sexual abuse, the entertainment industry and the press. She was hounded by paparazzi and excoriated for gaining weight. I found the first chapters of the book a little dull. For me her story really took off when she met Nick Lachey and together they became the first stars of reality television. Tommy Mottola comes off as a terrible person — telling her seconds after she signed her first contract that she needed to lose weight (she was 5’3 “ and 118 pounds), and cynically imposing a formula on her talent that just didn’t work, instead of helping her find her true voice. John Mayer comes off badly, and her parents don’t come off all that well, either. She was more of a product to them than child in need of protection.

I feel like that book remains to be written, and probably by a gay man. This novel has been described as the Great Gay Novel, but I doubt it is that. I feel like that book remains to be written, and probably by a gay man. I feel like this is a novel about sexual abuse — all sexual abuse is heinous, but there are layers and degrees to everything, even in hell, and here Yanagihara writes about the kind of sexual abuse practised by the utterly depraved; by monsters disguised as average men. It’s not giving anything away to say this; it becomes clear early on that the main character, Jude, has suffered grievously; sustaining perhaps irreparable damage. (It is the ´perhaps’ that keeps us going in part — can he or can he not be saved?)This novel is also about friendship; the kind of friendships and lifelong collaborations found mostly in books and movies — deep friendships that endure more than 30 years — when in real life real friendships wax and wane and founder more often than not, accidents and frequent victims of geography. (In fact I found this to be the least credible part of the book.) It’s also, interestingly, about the uniquely American ways in which it is possible to become successful, success unique perhaps, the author hints, to New York City, the spoils of which include multiple residences, global travel and booking historic monuments in Spain for three private hours as a birthday present.But it is when Yanagihara deals with horror of sexual abuse — predators bring their own sheets to motel appointments; victims never feel clean again; the scars are something no amount of love and success can erase — it is here that the novel rings truest and is at its most searing. One gets the impression that the author has either done tremendous research; has perhaps (and I hope not) been through it herself or knows someone who has. If none of these things are true, Yanagihara is an empath and her imagination, genius.Almost every sentence in this book is perfect. I often find books to be too long; even 300-page books. Not this one, which creates a problem. At more than 800 pages, it took up four weeknights and an entire weekend of my life, rendering me uninterested in much else.I wouldn’t recommend this book to everyone.

I am not the biggest fan going of Virginia Woolf, let’s start with that, but I was looking forward to reading The Years, because I thought it would whisk me away to late 19th-and-early-20th century England, but no. There is quite a lot of detail about the skies and the clouds and the rain and what one can see looking out of a window, and trees and leaves and more rain and snow and rain and clouds and clouds and rain and clouds. The colour yellow shows up everywhere from walls to tracks in the snow to chickens. Are you bored yet? This book is stultifying; it never takes off; it is filled with people who interact with others sparingly and live long lives in which little happens. It’s interesting to know what people thought the first time they saw a plane in the sky or cars overtake the horse-and-carriage, what a waste of my time this book was. It went nowhere. All the fun stuff happens off-stage — the falling in love, the heartbreak, the dying — all that is dealt with in sentences while all the scaffolding of life is described in excruciating detail. But the most infuriating thing is the pointless conversations, which go on forever without going anywhere.I would not recommend this book to anyone. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Apr 18, 2021","Apr 18, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18852.The_Years

Her voice A master of the uncomplaining voice, says the inside dust jacket, perfectly capturing Cathrin Bradbury’s unique and engaging point-of-view. Her voice feels fresh and new, although she’s been working as a journalist in Canada for decades. If this book is any measure, she’s been wasting her talents. I have been looking for more Cathrin Bradbury to read since her essay on sharing her home ran in the Toronto Star in October, 2018, link below. I read it three times, trying to parse out how she so expertly wove wit and honesty and elegance together. Bradbury is at her best when she is addressing a specific topic — like the PNM, or Promising New Man — who takes up much of the first few chapters of the book. The second half of the book sags in places — she doesn’t succeed in making everything that happened to her interesting, and some of it is in fact, not that interesting. But that is often the case with books of all kinds, fiction and non-fiction. Beginnings always get more time and energy and attention than endings, which are often rushed, and middles, which can be a slog, a mirror of our lives, really. That is why this book gets a four star and not a five, but if Proust is a five I think the average writer should feel good about a four.Bradbury keeps good company, including two other Canadian journalists I have long admired: Ian Brown and Johanna Schneller.Birds of a feather.Here’s a link to the story in the Star that got me interested in reading Bradbury: https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.thest......more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Mar 13, 2021","Feb 28, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/54227861-the-bright-side

It’s brilliantly plotted, right to the last pages. In fact it’s so vigorously plotted it’s a bit exhausting, at times a bit like a tennis match, with control swinging back and forth between rivals. I like that the female characters may or may not be ahistorical. If a woman in the Middle Ages would never even have thought to take charge the way the female characters in this book do, then kudos to Follett for making sure there were strong female characters in the book no matter what. And if they did take charge the way they do in this book, then nothing has changed much in the past 900 years! I think, generally speaking, that we tend to think of people in different times as lacking the full range of emotions we ourselves feel. We think they were grim, humourless and obedient. But people have been laughing and working and scheming and falling in love like maniacs since there were people, driving them to do all kinds of crazy random stuff, including undertaking a pilgrimage to Spain with an infant to find a lost love. Anyway, this book is an interesting romp through England (and parts of Europe) from 1123 to 1174, starting with the sinking of a ship carrying the heir to the British throne and ending with the murder of Thomas Beckett and King Henry’s atonement. Along the 973 pages, we learn what it was like to live as a peasant, an earl, a priest and a king, and what it was like to be a woman, utterly without power in the world. I didn’t have the patience to slow down for Follett’s loving and detailed descriptions of building churches, which was what inspired him to write the book in the first place. He’s a mystery writer who fell in love with stone churches and took time off from his day job (writing mysteries), to write this opus. It took off through word-of-mouth and is still in print and popular 25 years later. I’d recommend this book to a lot of people.

I rolled my eyes and nearly returned it. A couple of things kept me going — George FlI began this book dubiously, with a big fat chip on my shoulder. I rolled my eyes and nearly returned it. A couple of things kept me going — George Floyd’s death at the hands of a Minnesota police officer and the resulting worldwide protests; the numerous videos surfacing that show police using excessive force against people of colour, and the fact that a colleague once described my reaction to something he said as an example of white fragility. Him saying that stopped me cold. I had never heard the expression before — it was newer then. I felt that it was incumbent upon me to learn more.Also, DiAngelo is no newbie. She has impressive academic credentials and works as an anti racist educator. She has been reading and thinking deeply about this issue for a long time and I respected that enough to persevere. She’s also not a terrible writer.She snagged me in the beginning by pointing out something I didn’t know. We commonly say that women got the vote in the US in 1920. But the truth is, white women got the vote in 1920. Black women got the vote in 1965. There is not one history, there are many, and one is Black and one is white. Her central thesis is this, that people in North America live in a society that is deeply separate and unequal by race, and white people are the beneficiaries of that separation and inequality. This insulates white people from racial stress — a burden Black people carry with them at all times — and white people feel entitled to and deserving of the advantage this gives them. Because whites rarely experience racial discomfort, we have no stamina when it comes to addressing issues of race, DiAngelo argues. We crumple easily, are defensive and lash out when we are accused of being racist, even when we’re being racist.The fact that there remains an absurd disparity in conditions between whites and Blacks is evidence that we live in a racist society, she argues. Whites still rule most institutions, including police, the legal system and business. It’s mostly Blacks and people of colour who populate prisons.She begins with how white came to be as a concept, first appearing in colonial law in the late 1600s, to protect and preserve white superiority and dominance and rationalize slavery, but moves quickly to the present day and remains there for most of the book. White people, she argues, need to understand that racism is not an event — it’s not just rednecks flying confederate flags — it’s an intricate system and white people need to understand how they support that system, even white people who don’t believe they are racist, perhaps because they have Black friends or marched for civil rights in the 1960s.She points to an advantage I didn’t know whites have but as soon as I read it I knew it was true — we enjoy psychological freedom from the tether of race. I could relate immediately, because I see daily how white men enjoy psychological freedom from having to think about things like personal safety from sexual assault or more mundane things, like how a household functions or how social relationships are maintained. Whites don’t carry the psychic weight of race, which frees them to be more productive, which leads them to be more successful. It allows us to perceive our experience as universal, when it is not. It allows us to see ourselves as individuals instead of as members of a particular race. It allows us to believe that we live in a meritocracy when we do not. Segregation deprives all of us, DiAngelo points out. How much richer would our lives be if we interacted in a meaningful way with Black people instead of offering little more than superficial acceptance? DiAngelo argues that we must pull this racist system up by its roots, and our role, as white people, is to do start doing the work — to deeply examine what we think and why we think it and to challenge racist beliefs and practices when we encounter them. The resources are out there, she says — there are so many books to read and courses to take. It’s time we started reading them and reflecting and making meaningful change.

There was little new for me here.Maybe his thoughts were revolutionary at the time — it seems like some of his ideas, for example, have been incorporated into cognitive behavioural therapy, including the idea of paradoxical intention, which I think is close to what is now called behaviour modification therapy and was called reverse psychology when I was growing up. An example: A child who stutters badly tries to compel himself to stutter and finds he cannot. One of his core ideas seems to have been borrowed by Jordan Peterson as part of his philosophy of life: You must find your purpose. And it must be your purpose, chosen freely by you. Trying to live a life recommended to you by someone else or by society won’t work for you, unless it also happens to be your dream. Find your dream and live your dream is the basic idea in this book. And also, importantly, that there is beauty in suffering. Enduring makes us better. Yes it does. He includes a caveat — freedom must be accompanied by responsibility, otherwise chaos ensues. “Live as if you were living for the second time and had acted as wrongly the first time as you are about to act now.”He practiced what he preached. Man comes home from Auschwitz to learn the pregnant wife he left behind has died along with the rest of his family. Two years later he marries again, becomes an esteemed psychiatrist, publishes a book that has now sold 15 million copies; gets a pilot’s licence and climbs mountains. A hard man not to like, and as I said, perhaps he was a pioneer. But his philosophy, laid out in this book has become so widely disseminated and used as to make the book almost unnecessary, which I think would have pleased him. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jun 08, 2020","Jun 08, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/26146.Man_s_Search_for_Meaning

I thought I was going to get caught up by Detective Jerry Bourque, but he seemed muted for swathes of the novel and I never really felt much for the reporter, although I expected to identify with her the most. I thought her daughter’s character was the most nuanced and complex — Barclay sure understands where a woman that age is coming from — does he have daughters? But there wasn’t enough of her. Maybe the book would have been more interesting if she had been a main character, with her conflicting feelings about her mom the successful journalist?If it were 50 pages shorter, or if the time spent describing mundane tasks had instead been spent developing the characters more deeply, I think I would have enjoyed the book more.I think it would make an excellent movie....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Apr 11, 2020","Apr 11, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43309498-elevator-pitch

The characters Crummey invented had the potential to become lodged in the minds of readers the way say, Owen Meany did. They were close to Dickensian, in fact. And then pffffft. A bunch of things happen to them, but there’s so much detail about all the work they have to do all the time just to stay alive that the book itself becomes a chore. Personally, I feel Crummey was working too hard to make it a genuinely Newfoundland book — he seems to have emptied the Dictionary of Newfoundland English into it. Some passages were so full of slang and thick with descriptions of tasks few people today are familiar with, performed with tools most people have never heard of, as to be impenetrable. Why include them? (I have heard the same complaint made of Moby Dick. So Crummey is actually in great company — Dickens AND Melville.)Too many times, Crummey builds up our expectations, only to let the story peter out instead of catch fire. I lost count of how many times they went to the berry patch.And, small point, and I might be wrong, but I was told that a tilt was something people built for temporary shelter, not anything like a house that was occupied year-round, by a family, over a period of years. How would they not freeze to death? The sex scenes were bumpy too, even though, I know, sex is hard to write. A couple of the sex scenes were infuriating, from a woman’s point of view. And, fair warning, the sex in this book will be upsetting to some readers.I feel like Crummey has the material here for a Great Novel. Instead it is a good one. Did he need more time? Another rewrite? Better editing?He has the skills and the imagination to do better, and may already have done so — I’ve not read his other, much acclaimed, novels and poetry.More educated people than I have greatly enjoyed this book, and that may properly sway you, but I would not recommend it....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jan 09, 2020","Jan 09, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/44540158-the-innocents

Not only was she adored by her children, she was beautiful and capable and had a high profile career as a writer in New York City. Her daughter, like everyone else around Malabar, was blinded by her light and her charisma, in addition to the built in-blindness that kids have when it comes to their parents, at least until they become teenagers and begin to detach, a natural and necessary part of becoming an autonomous adult.But Malabar manipulates her daughter into becoming her confidante and an accomplice to her infidelity, relying so heavily on her daughter’s support that it is not until years after her own marriage founders that Brodeur is able to slowly and with great difficulty, break free.Both Brodeur’s parents were writers and she credits her stepmother with steeping her in great literature, sparking the desire in her to pursue a writing career. So it is perhaps not surprising that she has considerable skill as a writer.The book is finely wrought. It’s not the kind of shrill denunciation that made Mommy Dearest — perhaps the first modern bad-mom book — a scandal and a roaring success.Brodeur is talented and disciplined and nuanced — she fairly points out how her mother struggled with her own mother and vows to break the matrilineal chain of toxicity.It feels like she also got some superb editing.

Or I wanted it mostly. Or I wanted it in the background. Or I was bored...”This particular list goes on for nearly all of page 368, and it’s one of dozens in the book requiring discipline and patience to get through. And respect. Because TBA is an obviously talented writer and thinker and she deserves to be read seriously, but seriously? I understand her impulse as a writer to put all these beautifully sculpted sentences together on a page, but did no one in the process notice that it was too much?I barely finished this book. I nearly gave up halfway. My respect for her as a writer drove me unhappily towards the end, which is where the book began to improve.Part Three, Rachel Fleishman is in Trouble, is the strongest in the book. Why did I have to spend 292 pages with the unlikeable Toby before getting to the most interesting character — Rachel, roughed in across 100 pages? Toby starts off as a sympathetic character but he lost my affection around the time he fired the family’s long serving nanny by text in a fit of temper.TBA inverts the marital stereotype — a mother and primary bread-winner abandons the marriage and the kids instead of dad earning and abandoning the kids — making the point that in no way can women have it all as promised. The flip side of that is that neither can men, whose money is spent while they are criticized for not spending enough time with their kids because they’re out earning the money to support the family.And the plot. What plot? We spend hundreds of pages learning the minute details of Toby’s life, including everything that he orders each time he eats in a restaurant and what’s playing on the TV in the cab he takes to visit one of the women he meets online, or to go to work, or to get his kids somewhere.Here is the plot: His wife disappears but she’s not dead. Toby takes the kids to camp. He takes them to the Hamptons. He goes to work. He comes home. He adopts a dog. He thinks about sex; he has sex. And on and on and on.Overall, I would have loved this book a lot more if it were a lot less.I bet it becomes a movie — probably a good one, and I will pay to see it, but I can’t recommend this book....more",Notes are private!,0,8,3,"Nov 17, 2019not setnot set","Nov 23, 2019not setnot set","Nov 23, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45485744-fleishman-is-in-trouble

In fact, many of the sentences sound like contemplations made at the end of a day. There’s lots of insight in this book. Coyote often speaks at schools, and encounters children struggling with their own sexuality and gender identity. “What I really wanted this kid to know is that they are going to need to somehow build up the calluses around their hearts a little.

That is one of the arguments at the heart of this meticulously researched book, written with flair by Ann Dowsett JohnstonAlcohol is the new tobacco. That is one of the arguments at the heart of this meticulously researched book, written with flair by Ann Dowsett Johnston, who was for decades one of Canada’s best magazine writers and editors, and who throughout that time, struggled with her own alcoholism.Her central message is that women are being duped by increasingly sophisticated marketing and advertising to drink away their troubles and for too many women, the drinking becomes a disease. Women don’t metabolize alcohol the way men do so the addiction can grab hold of them more quickly than it does men. Women drinking during pregnancy are giving birth to children who struggle their whole lives as a result of brain damage, often undiagnosed, sustained during their fetal development. Trauma, including sexual assault, often leads women to binge drink, which in turn puts them at risk of more trauma.Mining her own struggle with alcohol, ADJ tackles perfectionism as one of the root causes of alcoholism. Brainwashed into thinking that drinking is okay, even healthy, we aren’t doing enough as a society to regulate it, warn people of the perils of alcohol, or treat them effectively when they become ill.Legislators who rely on the backing of alcohol companies — to fund events, to fund campaigns — will not take them on.And nobody wants to be a party pooper. Drinking is fun! Right? Right?As the blurb on the back of the book says, Dowsett Johnston was the chief architect of Maclean’s magazine’s university rankings issue.She was a vice-principal of McGill University in Montreal when her world began to crumble under the weight of her own devotion to drink.I met ADJ by accident once. I was part of a committee — something to do with young writers — maybe judging a writing contest? It was long ago. I am not sure how this came up, but at one point I mentioned that I had come across a beautiful phrase in Maclean’s, about how when kids go to university, they are leaving their “uniquely calibrated worlds of home.”Suddenly a little voice piped up from the bottom of the table. “That’s my line. I wrote that.” It was Ann. She said an editor had tried to take it out of the story, because he didn’t think it meant anything.

Sentences have to be read and reread before they make sense and because they are beautiful. The characters This short book takes a long time to read. Sentences have to be read and reread before they make sense and because they are beautiful. The characters are stock characters — the shiny socialite somewhat lacking in substance; the kind, average husband, startled and grateful to be married to her, incapable of deep passion; the feckless former lover, still enamoured decades later; the girl she kissed in college, now the contented mother of five sons. None of these characters are unique in the way that Ignatius J. Reilly is in A Confederacy of Dunces, or Owen Meany in A Prayer for Owen Meany. Nor did Woolf invent stream-of-consciousness writing — Proust did it earlier and more exquisitely and James Joyce is recognized as the English language master of the form. So what is it about this book that endures?Woolf wasn’t striving to create unique characters with Mrs. Dalloway, she was seeking to turn ordinary characters inside out, to expose their interior lives, including the parts they keep hidden from themselves, and to look at them through the eyes of other characters.It works best with Septimus, a WWI soldier who, like Woolf, suffers from a mental illness. (He has PTSD, she probably suffered from bi-polar disorder, which must have been terrible, with no pharmaceutical interventions available). When she describes how carefully he decides to look up, for example, unsure of whether what he will see is real or unreal — she may be drawing directly on experience, and that gives it power. At another point black cabs turn the corner like water curling around the foot of a pier. Original. I was attracted to this book because of the density of the writing, the challenge of figuring out when the thinking has segued from one character to another and what is meant by a some of the long tangles of words. It’s a puzzle and poetic. I’ve wondered whether Woolf would be known today had she not been a member of London society and owned a printing press together with her husband. Her half-brother published her first book.But I am glad she was published. Her writing has undeniable power, beginning with that commanding first sentence: Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself.

I thought she was a strong woman and a feminist by example, living her best life. She pushed against the boundaries of acceptable behaviour for women: With the movie “About Last Night,” where she played a woman conducting a one-night stand; with the powerful photo of her naked and hugely pregnant, on the cover of Vanity Fair; and even though it sounds small, it’s not — with her short hair, signalling that she was going to do what she wanted to do, when she wanted to do it. She became the highest paid woman in Hollywood because she demanded to be paid well — her movies were enormously commercially successful and she was headlining them — she deserved it. But even while she was being paid $12 million, her husband, Bruce Willis, was pulling down $20 million. She was a great actress. She was mesmerizing in Ghost, which has become a classic. She was fantastic in G.I. Jane, a hugely underrated movie. She literally trained like a Navy SEAL for that one. It wasn’t quite all that behind the scenes. She could never be herself for long in her relationships with men. Inevitably she became the pleaser in the relationship, the fixer, an emotional contortionist without enough courage or even the vocabulary to voice her owns needs. And yet it’s incredible that a woman whose mother sold her for sex to a predator — for $500 — achieved anything at all.My favourite parts in the book were when she discussed how she got selected for movies and what it was like to film them. She once told a director not to say another word about her body! I feel like she and Bruce Willis signed NDAs not to speak about their relationship, there is so little detail about them. But somehow it’s enough.I felt terribly for her as she recounted how her relationship with Ashton Kutcher failed and how as it failed she did the exact wrong thing, becoming needier and trying to please him instead of investing in her own life. She alienated her children. They didn’t speak to her for two years. I can’t imagine the pain. At the same time, I feel like she was holding back a bit on the details of that, but people are entitled to their privacy, even in a memoir. In the end, I felt like I’d had a long conversation with an actress I’ve always admired and that she was as open as she wanted to be, which was fine by me.I’d recommend this book to people like me, who have an interest in Hollywood and its denizens and the emotional stories behind great movies.262 pages...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Oct 24, 2019","Oct 24, 2019","Oct 25, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45167624-inside-out

This one was written by a high school student in Edmonton and his English teacher, so, pretty high on the simple and guileless scale. It was interesting enough, but it lacked detail in critical areas. While we got to know something of the writer’s inner life, the women in this book are mute and unknown. It’s billed as the story of a refugee, but the story focuses, for about 90 per cent of the book, on the family’s life in Iraq, then Homs, then Damascus, back to Homs and then to Edmonton. That too, is part of the problem; the book plods faithfully in the footsteps that the family took and there is much repetition and only the smallest of narrative arcs. It’s a bit like someone telling you what happened on every day of their vacation. The book could have spent another 100 pages on adjusting to life in Edmonton, with far more detail, and would have been better for it.Having said all that, this book is better than it might have been. It takes grit and skill and determination, perseverance, to write a book and the English teacher who pushed it through should feel proud for having done it and for getting this story into print.The writer’s innately joyful and optimistic world view, his simple love of family, are all endearing qualities.

He’s always happy to see you and hang out and talk and tell you the most interesting stories, but he’s never leaving his hometown. That’s a Stephen King character — simple and straight forward, but smart, with surprising depths. And that’s a Stephen King book.King’s characters are immediately sympathetic. I read to find out what happens to them and then I get wrapped up in the plot and then I’m reading in four-hour stretches and telling people not to bug me, I’m reading.Measured against your average book, this is a four-star. But measured against what Stephen King writes, it’s a three — not up there with his many four and five star books (The Stand, 11/22/63). King returns to a favourite them here — people with the power to move things with their minds and read minds, and an evil conspiracy.This book had the potential, I think, to be among his best, but it ran too long and the end seemed rushed.I feel like Stephen King sells so many books that his publisher lives in stark terror of him leaving for a rival publisher and as a result King has more control over his work than other writers do. This can be a bad thing. Many of his books are just too long. I think this one would have been much better at 400 pages than 561.The first 300 pages are riveting and there are flashes of brilliance through.

In her acknowledgements Erpenbeck thanks many people for their good conversations, which signaled to me that she did some primary research. It wasn’t totally perfect. I feel she sacrificed depth for breadth, employing a large cast of characters, and while I cared for them I didn’t bond deeply with any one of them. Even after 300 pages I found myself asking: which one is this one, again? SPOILER ALERTI found the ending a bit Disneyesque, with so many people living in seemingly perfect harmony in one house. Also, I felt several times before the end that I had reached the end. Which might be how refugees feel as they try to find a new home....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Aug 22, 2019","Aug 22, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/34390247-go-went-gone

They love each other genuinely and sincerely for one hour. They become ill with rage and love and call for doctors. This was a bear to read. It starts off simply enough, but dives quickly into a discourse on the value of ecclesiastical courts and that’s where I nearly stopped and probably should have. This is a book best read in a class with a professor who can guide the reading. It’s a long, rambling, complicated book that veers off often and suddenly into religious debates that are not as central to modern readers as they would have been to readers in 1880, when the book was published. I liked it because it offered insight into Russia and, I think, the character of Russians — all true Russians are philosophers, Dostoevsky writes. I liked the historical insights — a peep into the past, when people travelled by horse and carriage and certain classes were lucky to own a single set of clothes. Market day, some humour about the newly adopted metric system. Amusing, interesting. And having been raise Roman Catholic, I wasn’t entirely uninterested in the religious and philosophical debates. Is the idea of God necessary for world order? Are we all guilty of each other’s sins?What will happen when all former morality collapses? “People will unite in order to derive from life all that it has to give, but they would seek purely earthly happiness and joy,” Dostoevsky writes. I don’t think this book needs to be on a reading list in 2019. It’s been called one of the best books ever written, but it didn’t beat my favourite book of all time, Swann’s Way, by Marcel Proust. It took me five weeks to read, at 974 pages, and I was unhappy for much of the time reading it, but like a marathon, it feels like an achievement. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Aug 13, 2019","Aug 13, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2892069-the-karamazov-brothers

The characters were compelling and the relationships between them were complex and adult, and there was the issue of the falling down houses they lived in, and who isn’t interested in a good real estate story? Then it slowed down considerably, to focus on a 150-year debate about Darwin vs religion, and I lost interest. There’s an important issue underpinning this book — our materialistic world is sliding towards a very different future, something perhaps unrecognizable and unnavigable by people in charge today, who seem asleep at the switch. The idea that there’s a new generation poised to take over and change everything about how we live is intriguing. I wanted to know more about them. But in the end, I felt like Kingsolver was trying to explore too many ideas that didn’t quite work together.

I go through periods of disenchantment with fiction and books like this are the reason why. Pachinko is a New York Times best-seller; a national book award finalist; declared one of 2017’s 10 best books by the NYT Book Review, and it really, truly, is nothing special. Characters are drawn and things happen to them, their children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren and on for nearly 500 long pages. Min Jin Lee has some insight — she’s an older writer with personal experience to draw on, but I can count the number of interesting insights on the fingers of one hand. The prose is serviceable at best. The characters include a prostitute with a heart of gold. People are born and marry, and then bam, they die, and the chapter ends and it’s many years later and you’re left feeling...nothing. Resentfully, at the halfway mark, when I realized it was definitely not going to get better, I soldiered stubbornly on. How can the NYT be wrong? How can so many book buyers be wrong? How does the whole system conspire to push something so mediocre to the top of the pile?I learned things I didn’t know — the relationship between Japan and Korea and the discrimination experienced by Koreans living in Japan were new and interesting to me. But the book was devoid, to me, of suspense. I kept turning the pages out of idle interest, not because I ever became invested in the characters.I read every word, including the interview with the author at the end, and oddly, I found that to be the most interesting part of the book.

I was overcome by a strong premonition: This child would bring me a terrible sorrow.”And he did. Dylan Klebold joined his friend and classmate Eric Harris on a murderous assault at Columbine High School, in Littleton, Colorado, that was at the time described as the worst school shooting in history. Which it wasn’t. A school shooting in Montréal a decade earlier had claimed 14 women, plus the shooter. Twelve students and one teacher were killed at Columbine. Including Klebold and Harris, the total was also 15.This book is a long apology from Klebold to her son’s victims — the dead, the wounded and their families. She says she never saw it coming; did not know her son was so angry, depressed, homicidal. He went to his prom and had a great time. He was planning to attend college in Arizona in the fall. He bussed his own dishes after supper every night. Klebold goes into detail about Dylan’s upbringing, which was filled with Little League games and movie nights and attentive parenting coupled with loving discipline. She reports only one terrible fight between her and Dylan, in which she pins him up against the fridge, jabbing her finger at him and yelling. He calmly asks her to stop, because he says, he is getting angry and he doesn’t know if he’ll be able to control himself. She stops. They hug. Overall, she describes a home filled with love and warmth and affection. Despite that, there seemed to have also been a lot of conflict between her and her husband and their eldest son, Byron. My impression is that as parents the Klebolds may have perhaps been too involved in the lives of their sons; too restrictive; too instructional, perhaps even overbearing. But that’s the kind of thing that should inspire annoyance, not homicidal rage. One small contradiction stood out for me: Klebold said money was an issue in the home, and they worried about how they would pay for Dylan’s college education, but pages later, explains that she and her husband bought rental properties. I suppose there’s a way to explain that, but it did stick out.Klebold blames herself for not recognizing Dylan’s psychological decline and for not doing anything about it. A lifelong educator, she seems to have written the book to exculpate herself but also to warn other parents what to look for. She does discuss the bullying Dylan was subjected to at school and it sounds extreme. In one instance, he was circled by a group of kids who squirted ketchup on him. Another time kids at the school drove past him and threw trash out the window at him. Columbine High School in 1999 sounds like a horrible place to be, if you weren’t a jock or the prettiest girl in the school. I feel like the well-established culture of bullying at the school was probably a bigger factor than Sue and Tom Klebold’s parenting. Reading between the lines, it doesn’t seem to me that Dylan was headed towards a bright future, even if he hadn’t fallen in with Harris, who has been described as a psychopath. Dylan seemed instead to be headed towards deepening mental illness which, if it were something like depression maybe, maybe, would have cleared by itself had he been successful at college under sunny Arizona skies. That seems unlikely, given how tall and awkward and shy and unattractive he was. He was immature and painfully self-conscious. He didn’t seem equipped to handle the social demands of college life, but it’s possible, had he been lucky enough to fall in with a good group of friends, that things may have turned out okay for him.Harris was a psychopath, his journals filled with rage and dreams of violence. Dylan’s journals were rambling and confused and full of hearts — he needed someone to find him and see him and choose him to love.There are many lessons to be learned from everything that happened at Columbine. This book is an important part of that. It took me a long time to decide to read it, because I didn’t want to immerse myself in the subject matter. Reading it was difficult and it left me feeling bad, to be honest. But also more informed. Everyone who thinks of reading it has to decide if what they may learn is worth the difficult journey of reading this book.

Mining her own experience and with an expert eye for exquisite detail, Thuy beautifully renders the physical and emotional journey of a young Vietnamese refugee to Canada, highlighting the heart-rending realities that force people to emigrate.The translation by Sheila Fischman is excellent.My copy is littered with highlighted sentences and paragraphs.

The characters are my least favourite kind of protagonists: People who have it all and are unhappy; who spend too much time inside their own heads. But there is no denying that Krauss is a lovely writer. Many of the passages, about marriage, in particular, are moving and I reread them many times. In other parts the book drifts into a stiff, academic style of writing that leaves you wondering whether Krauss raided some of her college essays for material. But this book made me think: About choosing a life to live and living it; about the possibility of multiverses, about religion, Eden and the environment. An odd list and the reason why I am glad to have read it.

I think it's because at the heart of most business books is a single idea that could be dispensed with in 20-50 pages. But it's hard to charge $29.95 CDN for a 50-page book. This book is 143 pages, before the Afterward and Appendix (both worth reading). Setting that aside, it is better than most. Greenblatt is great at breaking things down into easy-to-understand pieces and somehow manages to create suspense -- probably because he doesn't reveal the step by step instructions until after the last chapter.

It features a large cast of characters, who each have at least one nickname Loved the plot but overall, this book did not live up to the hype for me. It features a large cast of characters, who each have at least one nickname but not always enough personal information to create a lasting impression in the mind of the reader. I found it impossible to keep them all straight. The chart at the front of the book needed to be expanded to include more of the characters and was virtually unreadable in the Kindle edition. The writing was uneven -- some of it was excellent and some of it was plodding -- the author relies too often on these words: always (three times in one paragraph -- how did that make it through the editing process?) tiny, small and tired. Emily is repeatedly referred to as small and tiny -- from her feet to her face.Some of the detail is fantastic and reveals much, for example, the descriptions of the girls preparing for a party, but there is much detail that is tedious, including more than a paragraph about a lamp.The plot is a good one and so is the point-of-view, or points of view, as the story is told through the eyes of the different characters. It rings truest in the parts dealing with the Metis police officer, which is perhaps not surprising as the writer is herself Metis. There are some interesting plot twists. The writer is clever, observant and talented, and the point she makes with book -- that sexual assaults on women are grotesque, grotesquely common and the impact resounds for generations -- is an important one, but much could have been done to improve this book, beginning with another copy-edit.

If you don't like tennis, read it. If you're a writer, read it. Searching for something? Read it. Agassi has had an interesting life, beautifully rendered in prose with the help of Pulitzer-prize winning journalist J.R. Moehringer. Among the fascinating pieces: Agassi's maniacal father; his Hollywood romance; his interior monologue during games; his physical struggles - my god, his physical struggles - it's truly shocking what athletes of this caliber put themselves through to win.

I thought the writing was good and although the characters were unlikeable for the most part, I was curious to see how things turned out for them. I would classify it as a beach read, however.
