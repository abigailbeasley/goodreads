There is space travel, knife fights with snarling villains, ray guns, the whole nine yards.But in 1965, it helped open up the idea of what science fiction could be. It’s an ecological fable, a psychedelic journey, a religious allegory, a world-building blueprint for George Lucas, and a tale of medieval-style political plotting in the fashion of Game of Thrones.Some things about it aren’t on point for 2024:1. The villainous men are described as effeminate and are homosexual pedophiles. There aren’t any positive LGBT exemplars here.2. The use of Arab culture and language in the Fremen (who are depicted as being in many ways, primitive), would today be called cultural appropriation.3. The hero, Paul Atreides, coded as “white” and a member of the ruling class, is the savior of the Arab-like Fremen. 4. There’s a society of women, the Bene Gesserit, who are in many ways like Jedis in their training and powers, but they seem to end up as concubines to powerful men, rather than leaders in their own right.But in many ways, it’s right on point for our times.

He also spent way too much time with some of the more tedious characters. And some of the plot points and character motivations were murky and ill-explained, and seemed to shift as the story evolved. When Erikson is being “deep” and “philosophical”, the story slows down. BUT all that aside, let’s get to what’s good, even great— the sheer inventiveness of the world and cosmos, the injection of new fantasy tropes, the variety and depth of the characters, the style of humor (when Erikson is funny, he’s very funny, and the humor is ribald and earthy).

And it’s a true crime story.Ultimately, whether it resonates with you may come down to how you feel about the protagonist, Michael Laudor. He’s described as a genius who is brought low by his schizophrenia. He ends up murdering his pregnant fiancee after refusing medication, because he thinks she’s some kind of automaton who means him harm.In my opinion, “genius” isn’t just potential. It’s what you do with the potential. Creating great works or formulating great ideas. To me, Michael, even at his best, came off as entitled and arrogant, a “sensitive genius”, in the words of George Costanza, but one who never translated that “genius” into something lasting or beneficial.

The unnamed narrator, in the first part, imparts his nihilistic philosophy to the “reader”, but then he reveals he doesn’t intend for his manuscript to be read at all. He’s writing it merely to crystallize his own thoughts. He argues in favor of free will, going against the growing orthodoxy of his time, which indicates that all human behavior is governed by circumstances and can be predicted. In opposition to this, he lives in a way contrary to society, and against his own “profit”, for the mere pleasure of being a person who decides for himself. In this way, he argues, he still profits even through suffering, for the reason that he preserves his own independence.In the second part, he flashes back to an earlier time, when he invited himself to a dinner party attended by several old classmates (who all despise him) for the purpose of showing his contempt toward them for thinking they’re better than him. He humiliates himself and ends up at a brothel where he meets a young prostitute and speaks to her about escaping the life she’s gotten herself into, and says he can visit her at his apartment. When she does so, he behaves rudely toward her (as we now come to expect of him).The thing about his contrariness is that sometimes his thoughts are contrary even to his contrariness. He vacillates back and forth and is always dissatisfied with any tone or action he takes. A chaotic individual. Dostoevsky wrote this before Crime and Punishment, but you can see Raskolnikov foreshadowed in this unnamed narrator. He manages to get to the heart of the psychological complexity of most people, who, unlike the characters in books by his contemporaries, aren’t “all one thing”, but are constantly jumping between extremes in their minds, if not so dramatically in their behavior....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,Oct 2023,"Oct 06, 2023","Oct 01, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18809.Notes_from_Underground

I was surprised to find she’s in her mid-fifties now. I guess she ages in real time. That’s the hazard of tying your stories into real life events (like Covid, in this instance).Although this book is a mystery, King isn’t a mystery writer per se. His characters rely largely on feeling and coincidence to solve their mysteries.

The final auction we see before the climax is chilling indeed.The auctioneer, Perly Dunsmore, is one of those sinister literary characters that seem to appear out of nowhere and serve dark forces, like Stephen King’s Randall Flagg and Cormac McCarthy’s Judge Holden.My only beef is that, for a relatively short novel, the buildup to the climax seems predictable and long in coming.Still, I can see why this novel is coming to be regarded as a modern classic. It has sort of a timeless feel, like a story by Bradbury or Shirley Jackson, and concerns the fears of rural folk who feel beset and victimized by more “sophisticated” city folks. Almost 50 years after it’s original publication, a tale about such fears seems to resonate even more in the age of Trump...more",Notes are private!,1,3,1,Sep 2023,"Sep 24, 2023","Sep 01, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/923832.The_Auctioneer

I always liked Veitch’s work, but this series seemed more extreme than his earlier work. It was too much for me at that time, but it left me curious. A super-powered infant modeled after Superman decapitating hundreds of people. A man who gains weird powers by bathing in bat guano. (He’s actually called “El Guano” — “The Shit” — a translation caption keeps telling us).An elderly Sherlock Holmes appears, for no discernible reason, as do analogues of Jerry Seigel, Joe Shuster, Walt Disney/Harry Donenfeld, George Reeves, and Robert Oppenheimer. Somehow, a few historical figures appear without the obfuscation of a name change: Albert Einstein, David Niven, Peter Lorre.I don’t want to give anything away, but in the end, it’s a story about the idea of the superhero and how it relates to the collective psyche of the 20th century. It includes references to how the comic book business chewed up and spat out its best talent, the Manhattan Project, and the later “darkening” of superheroes in the eighties. Some references to Veitch’s previous “Brat Pack” story is in there, and may confuse readers who haven’t also read that work.It’s an interesting misch-masch of ideas, but it just doesn’t gel. The last chapter seemed to shoehorn all the ideas together in a rush that didn’t make too much sense. It seemed like a twelve issue series that unexpectedly had to be finished in the seventh issue due to sales or contractual issues. Most of the appeal of Veitch’s work is watching his brilliant mind “dream up” disturbing takes on comics, popular culture, and current events. It’s worth reading for his fans, but don’t expect a coherent, cohesive story.The recent novella “What We Can Know About Thunderman” may have been influenced by Maximortal, which was in turn influenced by Moore’s earlier superhero deconstruction stories. “Thunderman” is probably the most complete statement about the ravages of the comic book industry visited on its creators....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jun 18, 2023","Jun 18, 2023","Jun 18, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/554491.The_Maximortal

Where those books were all action, this one is more of a detective story where Titus Crown, the Black sheriff of a backward Virginia county, hunts a serial killer. Titus keep arriving too late to stop murder after murder, until the final climactic scene. SPOILER WARNING:If you’re one of those mystery readers who tries to guess who the killer is based on the characters you’ve been introduced to (and there are many) and clues dropped, you can forget it. The culprit, although mentioned, doesn’t really appear in the story until he’s unmasked. He’s mentioned, and his name contains a clue, but that’s about it. This mystery doesn’t contain that type of guessing game.Titus Crown, though, is one of Cosby’s best characters, and Cosby does a great job at setting up the town, local personalities, and relationships. I’d like to see Titus, his father and brother, erstwhile girlfriends Darlene and Kelly, and Charon County again. I’d like to see Titus and crew star in a series.This book is more introspective and political than Cosby’s other books. Don’t get me wrong, the political soapbox isn’t one I disagree with. It’s just that, given the freight-train action of his earlier books, the weight of the politics camouflages what this book really is (and what I came here for— I ain’t lyin’): a violent crime thriller. Oh, you’ll get your violence. Until the fight at the end though, most of the violence is encountered in the grisly aftermath, rather than as it is happening. So what you have is a whodunnit (where you really can’t play the game, because the killer doesn’t come from an array of potential suspects) the introspection and politics characteristic of a literary novel, and the climax of a crime thriller. It’s a mixed bag. That doesn’t mean I won’t snap up Cosby’s next book. I will.

His capacity for self-criticism is both instructive and endearing. He has made substantial revisions to the earlier editions of this book in order to fine tune the precision of language.Kendi’s definitions focus on racist policies and ideas rather than racist individuals. And he sets out his thesis that these policies and ideas don’t come from hatred and ignorance, but rather that hatred and ignorance follow the policies, which are promulgated due to self-interest by groups and individuals. That the self-interest really doesn’t apply to benefit all members of the group, but only to certain privileged members, a small percentage. The rest of the members of the supposedly benefitted group are actually harmed by racist policies.Race is a construct, or a “mirage”. It has no biological basis in science. There is no “Black gene”, “White gene”, or “Asian gene”.

All or most of the characters seem to have had their storylines resolved. If I didn’t know there was still a war going on in the Seven Cities, that the Crippled God was still up to his machinations, and that Kalam, Fiddler, Icarium, Mappo, Crokus, and Apsalar still had stories to play out, I could very well have accepted this as the ending of the series.A lot of the elements reminded me of various comics I’ve read — in a good way! The “spit in the eye of death”, but jokey camaraderie among the Bridgeburners reminds me of the old Sgt. Fury & his Howling Commandos comics of the 60s. The sudden, silent appearances of Blend, which never failed to startle Picker, reminded me of the similar interplay between Batman and Commissioner Gordon. The magic of the this world, which often involves characters entering each other’s consciousness and achieving a sort of empathetic mind-meld, reminds me of the writerly tricks often used by Chris Claremont in his old X-Men comics. And the long finale of the book, in which some characters meet, and others make farewells, while all the while all that has gone before is remembered and deeply felt, reminds me of “The Wake”, the last book of Neil Gaiman’s Sandman series. The Malazan universe, by book three, contains many characters with disparate personalities and power sets, which seem to correspond with what you might see in a superhero universe.I wonder if Erikson was ever a reader of these comics, as the use of these tropes seem to be influenced by them....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,Apr 2023,"Apr 15, 2023","Apr 01, 2023",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/175983.Memories_of_Ice

Some readers are thrown when, after Book 1, the scene is shifted to a new continent and some new characters. But book two has a narrower character p.o.v. focus, which helps. Kalam gets a chance to shine, as does Duiker, the soldier/historian and Mappo, the emo Trell.

This was partially trueEverybody says this first volume of Malazan is a head-scratcher and things don’t come together until the second or third book. This was partially true for me. Here are my spoiler-free thoughts:1. The first couple chapters are slow and lugubrious.2. The middle 560 pages or so of this 657 page novel are exciting and intriguing. Most of the motivations are known and understood, although it’s obvious that there are some clandestine actions and manipulations going on behind the scene.3. The last 50 pages or so are very fast paced and exciting.4. There are a LOT of characters. So many that many of the main characters seem interchangeable. They never get the space to develop. But what they are all doing is interesting enough to keep you turning pages. 5. There aren’t so much heroes and villains as just people with opposing motivations.6. The last 50 pages introduce a lot of new concepts and characters. Seemingly out of nowhere.

The back and forth argument between Paul and the other Beatles regarding their management by Alan Klein, the lawsuits over the dissolution of the partnership and song publishing rights, the recording of McCartney (the first solo album), various singles, the recruiting of session drummer Denny Seiwell, former Moody Blue Denny Laine, and blues guitarist Henry McCullough, the formation of Wings and the making of their first Wings albums, touring, a TV special, family life on the farm, the smoking of lots and lots of “herbal jazz cigarettes”, and the truncated trip to Lagos, Nigeria to record Band on the Run, which yielded some tracks, but not a complete album, as anticipated.With Wings, there’s a tension between Paul’s wanting to be part of a band, and his tendency to be a control freak and a cheapskate, which eventually led to Seiwell and McCullough leaving. Laine stayed on, and it seemed like he may have done so out of lack of direction and ambition.Although it’s easy to see why Band on the Run was, then, and now, critically lauded, it’s a mystery why the critics savaged Ram, which is recognized now as a truly great LP....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jan 24, 2023","Jun 23, 2023","Jan 24, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60409964-the-mccartney-legacy-volume-1

Without giving anything away, it’s kind of anticlimactic, and a downer. As a crime novel in and of itself, I think it fails. Too little crime and too much soul searching.

Travis is a good-natured lug who lives on his houseboat in Fort Lauderdale, and occasionally takes on “salvage work” to finance his permanent semi-retired Jimmy Buffett lifestyle. His salvage work basically works like this: someone has been bilked out of a large some of money and will never get it back without Travis’s help. Travis recovers the money, but his fee is half the sum recovered.In this one, Travis and his buddy Meyer happen to be fishing under a bridge when a woman is thrown off the bridge wired to a hunk of concrete. Travis saves her life and uncovers a theft/murder ring who operate on cruise ships.Meyer has a bigger role in this one than in previous installments, and I hope this continues.The Travis McGee books all contain quite a bit of Travis’s homemade philosophy, which nowadays would be considered dated and chauvinistic, but at the time would have been fairly progressive.

The only drawback, for me, was Branch’s convoluted writing style. He often buries the lede of his paragraphs, states key facts passively, and often changes the subject completely mid-paragraph.Credit for the fight for civil rights goes to far more figures than just King, who seemed to fall into the role of leadership more than seeking to assume it. But he accomplished more with his Gandhi-derived method of non-violence than his rivals and critics. Some of those rivals were more interesting people to read about than the stead, mostly serious-minded King: Malcolm X, Stokely Carmichael, etc. The more I read about Lyndon Johnson, the more I admire him, and the more I read about Bobby Kennedy, the less I like him. But the sections that deal with these two, and with the malevolent and malignant J. Edgar Hoover, are fascinating.The main lesson to draw from these books is that King’s non-violent protests accomplished far more than all the violence in Vietnam, which accomplished less than nothing....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jun 30, 2022","Sep 11, 2022","Sep 11, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/95777.At_Canaan_s_Edge

Charlie Reade is a teenager from our world who, like Edgar Rice Burroughs’ John Carter, enters another world where he’s a hero. But like Robert E. Howard’s Conan, he has a touch of darkness in him. A bit of the anti-hero. The ultimate menace is a cosmic horror worthy of H.P. Lovecraft’s Cthulhu. All of these tropes are mixed in a loving tribute, but at the same time, a quintessentially King narrative.My only criticism, if any, is that the first third of this 600 page book takes place in the mundane world. You keep thinking, “Come on, Steve! Let’s get to the meat!” But maybe we need to live with Charlie and his circumstances for a while before we get to his fantasy adventures.I can’t help but hope for a sequel.Bonus: Half the illustrations are by the great Gabriel Rodriguez, co-creator, with Joe Hill, of Locke and Key....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Sep 06, 2022","Oct 07, 2022","Sep 06, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60177373-fairy-tale

It’s a collection of short stories including one long enough to be called a novel.HYPOTHETICAL LIZARD (three stars) I read this one three decades ago when it came out in a collection of prose stories by comic book writers called Words Without Pictures. It’s a fantasy that takes place in a brothel in a mythical city, where (SPOILER WARNING) an imprisoned concubine escapes by impersonating their free lover, leaving the lover in their place. It reads like a decent Ursula K. LeGuin story from the early 70s. Or maybe something by Michael Moorcock. Not as original as most work by Moore.NOT EVEN LEGEND (four stars) A society for the investigation of the paranormal routinely investigates urban legends. One of their number suggests they start to investigate paranormal beings who have remained hidden even from becoming legendary in the form of folk tales. This prompts a pair of such creatures to infiltrate the group. An inventive story and fun to read.LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION (four stars) During the Revelation/Rapture/Second Coming, the resurrected Jesus meets with his attorney, who has been engaged to handle the paperwork in transferring the universe to its new owner. Again, inventive and fun.COLD READING (three stars) a fake psychic get a taste of his own medicine. Pretty good, but ultimately the kind of thing you’ve already read in an old E.C. comic.THE IMPROBABLY COMPLEX HIGH ENERGY STATE (five stars for originality, two for enjoyability). In the first femtosecond of time at the beginning of the universe, a spontaneously generated consciousness emerges, followed by another, then by a whole passel of them. The original takes charge, and tries to set itself up as the god/creator/dictator of the rest. Sometimes Moore has a clever idea, and milks it to its logical conclusion, but the result is predictable. Although the story sometimes got a chuckle out of me (Moore is often very funny), I just wanted to get on to the next story.ILLUMINATIONS (five stars) A recently divorced man decides to visit a beach resort where he remembered being happy as a child, and in so doing, discovers that nostalgia engenders disappointment, boredom, and finally, horror. I’ve never seen nostalgia dealt with so effectively as a springboard for a horror story, and this one hits all the good marks.WHAT WE CAN KNOW ABOUT THUNDERMAN (five stars) I give this 240 page novel my highest rating, but I think full enjoyment of it requires a lot of knowledge about the history of American comic books. If you do have that knowledge, you’ll recognize certain people, thinly disguised: Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Roy Thomas, Vince Colletta, Archie Goodwin, etc. Many plot points and anecdotes are lifted from actual history. Some are made up or obfuscated. Comic pros and fans may be (delightfully) scandalized by this story. Is Moore bitter about his treatment and others’ treatment by an industry which chews up and spits out talented artists, while keeping the results of their creativity as cash cows? Definitely. That’s not to say he’s wrong. What gives the story its added frisson is the idea that American Comics (DC basically), is the earthly maw of some larger, Lovecraftian evil. Great stuff!AMERICAN LIGHT - AN APPRECIATION, BY C.F. BIRD (four stars for the poem, two stars for the story concept) Okay, so ostensibly this is a poem by an actual San Francisco writer of the beat generation, given explanatory footnotes by a critic, C.F. Bird. The poet and the critic are fictional, but the supporting cast and other geographic references are real. The poem is full of references to real Beat Generation people: Ginsberg, Kerouac, Cassady, etc., and references to ancient Egyptian mythology. The notes unironically explain the references contained in the poem. The structure of this story reminds me of Nabokov’s brilliant Pale Fire, which has a similar structure, only where the critic is insane, and perhaps a murderer, and the footnotes can be read for a suspense plot. The comparison is inevitable, and Moore’s story suffers by it. It just can’t compete at the level of Pale Fire. Good poem, though.AND, AT THE LAST, JUST TO BE DONE WITH SILENCE (three stars) This one refers to an historical event in the middle ages with which I’m unfamiliar. I’m intrigued by it, but have no context. Some time in the late twelfth century, some men raid a church sanctuary and grab someone who’s hiding out in there. They hang him. and them are punished by having to dig him up out of his grave and bear him around the countryside, where they are flogged. Eventually there are two men left who don’t remember who they are. One of them may be the hanged man.

Mrs. Maurier, an aging widow, invites a number of artists of varying disciplines. She styles herself as one who maintains a “salon” and the artists as her coterie.

You find out early on that the protagonist, Sean, has done something to himself. You kind of know what he did, but you don’t really know why.The most disturbing thing is that, maybe there isn’t really a “why.” Just the juices and chemicals of adolescence and young adulthood pumping through his brain and prompting dissociative states and “what ifs” that result in disastrous conduct.There’s an old underground comic by Robert Crumb. Mr. Natural. On the cover, Mr. Natural’s friend/foil Flakey Foont peers over a fence at Mr. Natural, an aged but childlike guru who’s riding a scooter happily down the street. “Mr. Natural, what does it all mean?” yells Flakey. Mr. Natural replies with a grin, “Don’t mean shee-it!” and speeds happily along.Aside from the existential dread and despair permeating the book, I also liked the nerdy references to Conan, Gor, and Doc Savage. Stuff that surrounded me too when I was a kid. Of those three, I didn’t ever read the Gor books by John Norman. A friend of mine did, and from his descriptions, they sounded pretty awful.

East Liverpool was once a thriving small This is a collection of interconnected short stories, all taking place in East Liverpool, Ohio and environs. East Liverpool was once a thriving small city supported by nearby steel mills and potteries. Starting in the eighties, East Liverpool’s economy started to go downhill with the closure of the mills, and has never recovered. I grew up there. I currently live there. Karen Kotrba, in these stories, really captures the ambience of my hometown.Given the interconnectedness of the stories, and the Ohio setting, one might either expect the elegiac quality of Sherwood Anderson’s Winesburg, Ohio, or the dark, twisted Appallachian noir of Donald Ray Pollock’s Knockemstiff. But neither of those is apposite. Rather, the characters are likable schmoes muddling through life on the edge of poverty. But they’re self-aware schmoes. They understand their their position and can laugh at themselves. The stories recall those of Raymond Carver, and are truly worthy of that comparison. The dialog feels natural, and the anecdotes that provide color are funny and awkward. Images and events in the stories will settle in your mind and take up residence. I’ll say though, this book needs a better title.

It’s also a detective story and a meditation on racial prejudice. A real page turner, and I fully expect Hollywood to take notice and turn this novel into a blockbuster film.A few things: 1) Slocumb says in the afterword that a lot of white people don’t believe the stories of prejudice that he has taken from his own life and incorporated as incidents in this book. I was probably one of those people at one time. Wait a minute…isn’t this the 21st century? People don’t act like that anymore, right? Well, yes they do. I’ve heard enough stories from people I respect to believe them. Racism is not a thing of the past. It’s almost as bad as ever. Don’t get all defensive, fellow white people. Just listen, and try to be better.2) I’d like a refresher course on classical music. I loved the music appreciation course I took in college. I’d like to take an even more extensive course. I’m familiar with more classical pieces than the average person, but reading this book makes me realize I don’t know nearly enough.3) SPOILER WARNINGAs a lawyer, I don’t think any court I know would have allowed the star witness in a criminal case to testify by video. The Sixth Amendment gives defendants the right to confront (face to face) and have their attorney cross-examine the witnesses against them. Maybe a court has allowed it, but it would seem to me to be pretty good grounds for appeal if it happened.Anyway, Brendan Slocumb is an author I’d like to read more from, and someone I look forward to meeting at the upcoming Booktopia event in Vermont.

Aside from that element of the story, which looks forward, it also looks backward, and satirizes the self-absorbed 70s, with its cults, cocaine, and disco.Stewart and his friend Sonja have a dynamic similar to Howard and his girlfriend Beverly, and at times you wonder if this wasn’t a Howard the Duck story that Gerber had in mind before he left Marvel. But if so, it’s improved by not having to abide the strictures of the Comics Code. The language is explicit and the humor is bawdy. All in all, pretty far ahead of its time for 1980.The art by Gene Colan and Tom Palmer is, of course, great....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Mar 19, 2022","Mar 19, 2022","Mar 19, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13185646-stewart-the-rat

This one doesn’t read so much like epic fantasy as like a steampunk western. Heroes Wax and Wayne have a dynamic very similar to James West and Artemus Gordon from the old TV series, The Wild Wild West.As in the previous Mistborn books, some people have genetically derived super-powers which come from metals. These powers are either given by allomancy (where different metals are ingested and “burned”), feruchemy (where attributes are stored in metals usually worn as jewelry), and hemalurgy (where abilities are stolen by killing others possessing these abilities and transferred to the recipient using metal spikes). A few new super-powers appear in this book: speeding and slowing down time, and instantaneous healing.It’s a wild ride, with shootouts and train robberies. For my money, though, this book seems lightweight compared to the more epic style of the first Mistborn series and my favorite Sanderson series, the Stormlight Archive.

It’s kind of tough to wrap your head around it, structurally and thematically. At first it seems like two unfinished novels and a third, finished one, using the same characters (or at least character names) in all three.The first seems like a Henry James pastiche, taking place in an alternate Washington Square where same sex marriage is legal. The United States we know is fragmented into several post-Civil War countries. The story concerns a young man’s choice: should he enter a staid, predictable, but comfortable and loving arranged marriage, or should he follow his heart and accompany his paramour (who may be a con artist out to fleece him) to California?The second takes place in 1993, the era of rampant AIDS. A young man (a native Hawaiian transplanted to New York), has entered into a “kept” relationship with a much older, wealthy white man. An unexpected letter from his father opens up a lot of questions about family, ethnic heritage, and the political destiny of his native land.The third part, set in 2093, is an all too believable dystopian story, where the connected disasters of climate change and pandemics have given rise to an authoritarian government.

In the case of The Wheel of Time, that takes some doing. I had read several volumes of the series in the early 90s and decided that the series would never end; that Jordan would just keep putting out additional volumes as long as people kept buying them. More recently, I started to get into Brandon Sanderson’s work, and really liking it, particularly the Stormlight Archive series. Knowing that Sanderson completed The Wheel of Time series after Robert Jordan’s death, I decided it was time to revisit it.What a long, strange trip it’s been! Reading through these massive volumes has been sometimes exhilarating and at other times tedious. The tedious parts occur when people’s clothing is described, when men describe the essential characteristics of women in sexist terms, and vice versa, when needless pages are spent introducing inconsequential characters, and when a party of characters seem to wander aimlessly or to fight a battle that’s not essential to the overall plot.But when the story is on fire, you really burn through the pages! Egwene and Mat are my favorites among the lead characters, and their arcs always shine.By the last book, you feel like you know all the characters so well— the major heroes, the secondary heroes, and some of the villains. Sanderson wraps it all up so satisfyingly, you don’t regret all the hours spent reading these books. Every character gets service and a fulfilling role to play. Almost every loophole and plotline are resolved.

With ""Black Hole"", one of the problems of reading it in installment format was the length of time between issues, sometimes a year or more. I would tend to forget key images and plot points that hold the overall story together. But when I finally got hold of the hardcover of BH, it all made sense. If you've read Burns' other work, you know what dark, nauseating worlds he creates, and this is no exception. The narrative alternates between the real-world story of Doug, a young artist, and an alien and mysterious dream world he inhabits as “Johnny”. In the dream world, he appears as a dazed, shell-shocked version of the Belgian comic character Tintin, and some of the landscapes in ""X'ed Out"" resemble the kind of thing you'd see in Tintin, except as seen through a dark lens. Tintin fans will also note that Doug has a black cat named Inky rather than a white dog named Snowy.The dreams relate to things that have happened to Doug in the real world, and the story is told in an intriguing nonlinear fashion that gradually fills in the blanks as to the death of Doug’s father, how Doug got his head injury, and the full story of his relationship with Sarah. It’s a storytelling tour de force, and leaps instantly to the top echelon of stories told in the comics medium....more",Notes are private!,0,0,2,"Aug 10, 2021not set","Aug 10, 2021not set","Aug 10, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/21480575-sugar-skull

That doesn’t seem true, given that a few of the characters who are given promising subplots are returned to almost as afterthoughts in the resolution. The Browns, Alice and her mother, seem destined to intersect in a big way with James Carker, possibly being the means of his fall from grace. But this never happens. Edith Dombey leaves the stage after her confrontation with Carker in Dijon, seeming prepared to finally take charge of her own life, but she is forgotten until a final emotional scene with Florence. Rob the Grinder never gets a significant part to play, nor do any of the Toodle family, although they are introduced with great fanfare in the beginning of the book.Mr. Dombey’s happy ending seems undeserved. He brings nothing but misery to the other characters and has nothing to redeem him. I think he is only rehabilitated in order to show how saintly Florence is. Dombey is similar to Ebenezer Scrooge in a way, but with Scrooge, you follow every step of his conversion by the ghosts, and you buy it. With Dombey, there are any number of points where he could have woken up to the disastrous course his pride was taking him, but he never did. I’d have been completely satisfied with him living out his life in despair.But all this having been said, there is some beautiful writing in this book, hitting on some real and complex emotional states, and Captain Ned Cuttle is one of Dickens’ most lovable and entertaining characters, as is Toots.For all that this book has shipping and sea voyages as a background, I would have liked Dickens to take a real try at writing a story, or t least a subplot, about life aboard a ship.

He's concerned with being ""manly"" and looks down on men who aren't. A lot of his behavior is what we would today call ""toxic masculinity"". But in his sphere, he is considered a successful man. The book tells us all about what life was like in precolonial times. Rituals, customs, family life, taboos, death, etc. Toward the end, the English missionaries come in and turn everything topsy-turvy, which is a disaster for a man like Okonkwo, although for some people it is better. For example, prior to the whites' coming, any set of twins born was summarily killed.

I remember when I was a kid, seeing the pictures of starving African children wiAn eye-opening book about the Nigeria/Biafra war of the late sixties. I remember when I was a kid, seeing the pictures of starving African children with emaciated limbs and distended bellies. We were encouraged to donate to charities, go door to door and collect money and so forth. But we were never made aware of the physical and political causes this starvation.According to this novel, colonialism had resulted in the people of Nigeria viewing each other as separate tribes, with the Muslims of the north more easily brought under the control of the English because they could pay off the local headman, while the democratic peoples of the south (later known as the Igbo people) were harder to control. Eventually the Igbo people were scapegoated as being grasping and money-hungry, and finally subjected to genocidal violence. The Igbo people centralized in the southeast, and declared themselves a new nation (Biafra), sparking a war of secession. Biafra was ultimately defeated, because the Nigerians were able to starve them out, and the rest of the world was apathetic toward Biafra. When the war ended, the Igbo people, who had been successful in business and academics, were impoverished, their property having been destroyed or confiscated. The book follows an Igbo family, principally led by twin sisters Kainene and Olanna, their significant others Richard, a white Englishman and Odenigbo, an Igbo professor, respectively. Another major character is Ugwu, Odenigbo's houseboy, a village boy who educates himself and becomes more sophisticated as the story progresses. The personal family drama of these characters is just as important as the larger story of the war. In fact, the war is only presented through the personal points of view of the characters. You never have the feeling that you're reading a history book, although you're learning a lot of history as you go.The book alternates between the pre-war early 60s and the wartime late 60s, and gives the western reader to understand how much of an aberration those photos of starving children were in this formerly prosperous country. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Mar 24, 2021","May 07, 2021","Mar 24, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18749.Half_of_a_Yellow_Sun

For a nineteenth century novel, this book offers an amazing lack of closure. Mitya is wrongfully convicted of the murder of his father, who had actually been killed by Smerdyakov, the servant and possible fourth Karamazov brother. An escape plan for Mitya to flee to America accompanied by Grushenka, is discussed, and will be attempted. This has been put together by Ivan, who is deathly ill with ""brain fever"". We know the plan will be attempted by Katya if for whatever reason Ivan is unable, but Mitya's escape and Vanya's health crisis are not resolved.We had been told that Alyosha was the ""hero"" of the story, but we never really find out what he does to earn that title, unless he earns it through the course of the narrative being a wandering facilitator and moral force for the rest of the characters.In a twentieth century novel, I would have accepted such an unresolved, ambiguous ending as a matter of course. Maybe Dostoevsky is a being a trailblazer, as one of the first novelist to let the readers sort out the ambiguities and resolutions in their own minds. I'm still giving it five stars, mind you, because I'm still thinking about it, but for now, the book is just shy of making my ""favorites"" shelf....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jan 26, 2021","Mar 04, 2021","Jan 26, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/138502.The_Brothers_Karamazov

As DC fans know, there are periodic continuity blow-ups that change the whole history and status quo of the characters. In the past several years, the writer in charge of most of these has been Scott Snyder.His style, like Grant Morrison's, is to breathlessly throw concepts and obscure references at you one after another until you're dizzy, but you finally surrender to the gestalt of what it's like to live in a frenetic superhero multiverse. The fact that I mention Grant Morrison is no accident, since this volume includes some of Grant's previous stories: Batman's ""death""at the hands of Darkseid and subsequent rebirth in a prehistoric age. Also, some of Snyder's previous Batman work is here, in which he introduces Duke Thomas and some concepts related to the immortal characters of DC and how they got that way.You're getting the prelude of ""Metal"", plus fragments of Final Crisis, The Return of Bruce Wayne, and Snyder's Batman/Joker magnum opus. As to the older stuff, I would be totally lost of I hadn't read these series in toto before. But even now, rereading only certain chapters of those stories makes for an unsettling and confusing reading experience that sent me back to DC wiki pages numerous times.I recommend reading the full version of the various series this book was pieced together from, but for the purpose I selected it for, it more or less did the job....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jan 09, 2021","Jan 09, 2021","Jan 09, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36268471-dark-days

If you're a newbie MaThis graphic biography does a great job at piecing together many interviews Kirby gave over the years into a coherent biography. If you're a newbie Marvel fan who always assumed Stan Lee created everything, this book will set you straight. Kirby, not Lee, was always the creative force behind most of the comic book characters you know and love. Be prepared for Stan to come off as a villain--even as the inspiration for Loki.Writer/artist Tom Scioli, channeling Kirby, makes a credible case that Jack deserves some credit for the creation of a couple of characters he's not usually associated with: Spider-Man and Iron Man. His influence can be found in Star Wars, too. It's eye-opening to see how events in Kirby's life became the basis for his stories. For example, his grandfather's feud with a local baron in a small European principality seems like the basis for the origin of Dr. Doom.At certain points, Scioli fudges the timeline. For example, you would think from reading this that Kirby's parody of Lee, Funky Flashman, was a reaction to Stan's claims in ""Origins of Marvel Comics"". However, Funky Flashman preceded ""Origins"" by several years.All in all, though, that's a quibble, not a big criticism.

He This is the first of the ""Patrick Melrose novels"", which is kind of a misnomer as to this one, since Patrick Melrose appears in only a few scenes. He 's a five year old child when we meet him, a scared kid subjected to horrifying cruelty by his monster of a father, David Melrose.Most of this short novel concerns a dinner party given by tyrant David and his cowed, alcoholic wife, Eleanor. Also present are the intellectual Victor, his American girlfriend Anne, upper class Nicholas, and his young girlfriend Bridget. David rules the roost with his cruel wit. Victor and Nicholas try to keep up. Eleanor is paralyzed into inaction by David's control over her. Bridget is callow and bored. Anne is the only adult the reader can really empathize with.St. Aubyn's concern seems to be depicting the decadent remnants of England's upper class, its members by marriage, and its hangers-on and wannabes. It's not a pretty picture. David, a member of this class, but who married Eleanor for her money, exemplifies its traits: cruel wit, a taste for gossip, and a certain nihilism.The novel has one of those ambiguous, trailing-off endings that occur in a lot of literary novels, but knowing it's part of a sequence, and that Patrick's story will continue, will keep me reading.

The latter part of the book had me turning pages up to the end. Not that the ending was particularly satisfying as to the discovery of the culprit.This is the first Patterson novel I've read. I can see how he's popular, but there are many better writers than he in the genre. Judging from this novel, Patterson's strength is in plotting and suspense. His weakness is his dialogue, which is unnatural and awkward. I guess it's a staple of serial killer novels that you're going to see a lot of misogynistic internal monologues from the bad guys, since serial killers generally prey on women. But in this book, the level of misogyny and sexual violence seemed to be ratcheted up to 11. Maybe I just need a break from this type of book.One scene I liked was where Alex Cross and his partner, both black cops, get arrested by white officers in an unfamiliar city. The point is made that they are being targeted because of their race. Cross and Sampson are able to handle the situation, but I fear the real-world equivalent would have been disastrous for them. Kudos to Patterson for recognizing and dramatizing this problem 26 years before the events in 2020 that finally seemed to have awakened white folks to this problem.Will I be reading more Patterson? I don't know.

It's hard to believe it was written in 1899.In it, a young wife and mother, while on vacation at Grand Isle, Louisiana, falls in love with a young man. Before this love is consummated or declared on either side, the young man leaves for Mexico. The young woman, Edna, goes back home to New Orleans with her husband and little sons. She is changed, awakened. She has a sense that she belongs to herself rather than to her husband, her sons, or the social strictures of New Orleans society. She begins to live for herself, pursuing art. And when her husband leaves for New York on an extended business trip, she abandons the big house and sets up a small apartment for herself. She becomes embroiled in a tentative love affair with another man.Her friend, an elderly musician, tells her: ""The bird that would soar above the level plain of tradition and prejudice must have strong wings."" Does Edna have strong wings? She had told another friend she would not sacrifice herself for her children. She would sacrifice all material things. Even her life. But not herself.Near the end of the book, the young man she had fallen in love with on Grand Isle comes back. A reckoning is had. The ending of the book, at first glance, could be taken as the tragic ending of a morality tale about adultery, like Madame Bovary or Anna Karenina. But something different is going on here. Edna meets a final fate, but I don't get from it that she's in despair. She's instead, taking her own life as a positive choice. Claiming her life and the disposition of it as her own. That's my take on it, anyway....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jul 16, 2020","Jul 19, 2020","Jul 16, 2020",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/52277.The_Awakening

But this book actually refutes its own argument. The directors featured were in large part decadent, drug addled megalomaniacs who were only as good as whatever material they were handed to adapt, and only if they could find a personal handle on that material. The only true auteur of the period, who conceptualized his own films and wrote his own scripts, was Woody Allen, and he is barely mentioned. Nor is Mel Brooks (maybe because he's not a ""serious"" filmmaker).

When he entered the home expecting to find the fugitives and ended up with a gun barrel against his head, I would have been more satisfied with an ending where he had, through believing his own tangled conspiracy theory, ended up in a meth house only to be executed by criminals....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Mar 28, 2020","Apr 09, 2020","Mar 28, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/38919694-the-forbidden-door

Well, I skimmed it the first time. There's a Joycean dream sequence in the beginning that at the time I wasn't ready for. But somehow I knew I'd come back to it someday and ferret out the method behind Farmer's madness. The story made a lot more sense to me this time. I appreciated the Joycean touches, the wordplay, and the vision of a post-work society where everyone gets a guaranteed basic income, and where status is gained not by acquiring money, but by producing artistic works. It's neither a utopia nor a dystopia. The art world is controlled by critics, who vie for their preeminence by creating convoluted analytical paradigms in discussing art. Also, an artist, to achieve popularity, must sometimes visit the ""casting couch"" of the critic.""Gonna Roll the Bones"" by Fritz Leiber also came out of Dangerous Visions. It's more of a fantasy story than science fiction, about a guy playing a craps game with Death. There are some racial slurs in the story which are off-putting, and I wasn't sure whether they were part of Leiber's world-view or whether they were there to highlight what a rotten guy the protagonist was.""I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream"" by Ellison is one of the best. I remember compulsively reading it as a teenager while waiting outside a sandwich shop and being blown away by it.""Nightwings"" by Robert Silverberg takes place in a rundown Earth of the future where the next alien invasion could come at any time. Human beings have been genetically altered to perform various jobs, and belong to guilds. In tone, it reminded me of Gene Wolfe's Book of the New Sun, which is a good thing.""The Sharing of Flesh"" by Poul Anderson isn't one of his libertarian tracts this time, but an investigation of a planet colonized by humans long ago that has adopted ritual cannibalism as a necessary part of keeping the race alive. The protagonist's quest for revenge against the man who killed her husband for food takes an interesting turn.""The Beast That Shouted Love at the Heart of the World"" by Ellison is not one of my favorites.

It starts with a future where people have learned how to ""jaunte"", or teleport, by using the unlocked potential of their minds. Earth has colonized the planets of the solar system, and conflict has developed between the inner and outer worlds.Enter simple, working-class Gully Foyle, who finds himself stranded in space in a wrecked ship with dwindling rations and air. Suddenly another ship approaches. Although he knows the other ship has seen his signal, it passes him by, leaving him to die. Gully nevertheless saves himself and vows to have his revenge against whoever decided to leave him in space.Gully is single-minded and has no scruples in hunting his prey. He uses and discards allies (usually women). Starting out as a simple worker, he eventually educates himself and assumes the identity of a successful circus impressario. Like Edmond Dantes, he is more of a force of nature than a person. Alert: Foyle exhibits a high degree of misogyny, although the women he partners with are portrayed as smart and resourceful. But other forces conspire to rehumanize him. The reader is left to decide whether he redeems himself.Four fifths of the book is a slam-bang pulpy adventure, but the last fifth gets a bit grandiose and preachy, somewhat dampening my enjoyment.

In the 60s, the overall literary quality of the Hugo winners seemed to be upped a bit from the 50s.The book contains ""'Repent Harlequin!' said the Ticktockman"" by Harlan Ellison, one of my favorite SF writers, although this is not one of my favorite Harlan stories. But maybe I'm just overly familiar with it. My favorites in this book are the two Jack Vance stories, ""The Dragon Masters"" and ""The Last Castle"". Vance creates worlds that seem to harken back to medieval times with feudal government structures, but are nevertheless futuristic and weird, with enclaves of humans long separated from the mass of their species, who are pampered lordlings served by genetically engineered alien slave races. Vance's prose style is haunting, and seem to be a precursor of Gene Wolfe's Book of the New Sun in tone.Poul Anderson offers up another libertarian piece with ""No Truce With Kings"". Judging from this and ""The Long Voyage"", Anderson seems preoccupied with casting suspicion on ""elites"" who ""know what's good for us"". (Elites are presented as more advanced alien races in his stories) Us dumb old regular people should reject any help from such as they, and muddle through as best we can, even if it means bombing each other back into barbarism. Anderson seems to prefer feudalism as a governmental form to the type of democracy we enjoy, even though the local ""bossman"" or strongman is just another elite telling the serfs what to do. But hold on! (Anderson would say) The ""bossmen"" recognize that they, in fact, in their superior entrepreneurial Ayn Rand-iness, are the ones competent enough to rule over the rest. How is that different from the elites that ""know better""? Hint: it's the same damn thing, just with a different political bent.""Soldier, Ask Not"" by Gordon R. Dickson was a nice slice of social science fiction with a noir feel, and Larry Niven's ""Neutron Star"" was the only hard science fiction story in the collection.

My favorites are ""Flowers For Algernon"" by Daniel Keyes, which I first read almost 40 years ago and which still tugs at my heartstrings, and ""The Big Front Yard"" by Clifford D. Simak, which reads like it could have been one of the better Twilight Zone episodes.As an actor, I appreciated ""The Darfsteller"" by Walter M. Miller, Jr., which is about an out-of-work actor who gets another chance to take the stage after actors have been replaced by machines.""The Hell-Bound Train"" by Robert Bloch and ""Or All the Seas with Oysters"" by Avram Davidson were, like Simak's story, reminiscent of The Twilight Zone. Earthbound stories rooted in the mundane, with a paranormal or science fictional twist.""The Star"" by Arthur C. Clarke is essentially a Christmas story. Of course, saying that might be a spoiler. The conceit of the story is that the Star of Bethlehem was a supernova that destroyed a great civilization. My problem with it was that the voyager who discovered it 1000 years in the future, 3000 light years from Earth, extrapolated that the star went nova about the time of Christ's birth, and that's why the star was extra bright. But if that were the case, it wouldn't have been visible as such on Earth until the time the story took place.""Exploration Team"" by Murray Leinster speculates a future where exploration of alien worlds is aided by genetically modified bears (bred to be as friendly to humans as dogs). Add a bald eagle equipped with a camera for reconnaissance and various deadly alien animals and you have the makings of a nice adventure story.""The Long Voyage"" by Poul Anderson, plotwise, was not very remarkable, but I really appreciated Anderson's use of a more archaic, seafaring language.My least favorite was ""The Allamagoosa"" by Eric Frank Russell, which is literally a shaggy dog story that ends in a sort of pun. Kind of a groaner, actually. There is an element of science fiction fandom which has always appreciated stunted humor, I guess. Overall, it's apparent that the science fiction of the time was rife with libertarian ideas. The heroes, for the most part, are ""rugged individualists"" who feel life if only worth living if you pull yourself up by your bootstraps and do it yourself, without the help of any government or benevolent alien race. Maybe we can chalk that up to the McCarthyism of the 50s, or maybe it was the philosophy of the SF magazine editors of the time....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Nov 05, 2019","Nov 06, 2019","Nov 05, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/222320.The_Hugo_Winners_1955_1961

In every novel, he not only takes on an inventive futuristic premise, but includes several other concepts, each of which could be the subject of its own novel.As everyone who's seen Blade Runner knows, the main plot concerns Deckard, a cop who has to shut down a group of renegade androids. The androids are sociopaths. The difference between their psychological makeup and that of most humans is they don't experience empathy. They are also highly intelligent. This leads to some interesting interviews as the androids try to verbally dodge having to take the empathy test Deckard uses to tell humans from androids. Anyone who has dealt with sociopaths will recognize these conversational gambits.One sub-scenario is the scarcity of animal life after a nuclear war, which has made people reverent and wistful about animals and also acquisitive, as they attempt to obtain rare live animals as status symbols. As a result of this scarcity, there are also those who deal in mechanical replicas which owners try to pass off as real.The other major sub-scenario is an empathy religion called Mercerism. Mercer is/was sort of a self-denying holy man whose goal is to walk up a rocky hill while being pelted with rocks. His followers use a kind of virtual reality device to merge with him and other believers, thereby enhancing their empathic feelings.Mercerism has a lot to to with the philosophical core of the novel, which I haven't quite unpacked yet.

Nightmare stuff.I'm going to jump directly into the next book in the series, which I don't often do.IMPORTANT NOTE: Having read further into the series, be aware that Koontz's right-wing politics come more and more into play. The villains are evil, wealthy, snooty, liberal, utopian elites. ""Do-gooders"" who want to improve the world by culling the population in certain ways. They are not wealthy oil-baron elites motivated by greed. If your personal demon is George Soros, you'll probably agree with his points. If instead, your bad guy is Charles Koch, you'll disagree. Personally, I become more annoyed by the series the more Koontz foists his politics on me, but I can't deny that these are well-constructed thrillers.If you can still enjoy the books knowing that the author is spinning right-wing conspiracy theories, go ahead and read them. If not, you might want to give these a pass. For me, I'm going to keep reading and ride the wave of excitement even though I disagree with the premise.

His trip encompasses the Orient Express, Japan's high-speed train system, and the Trans-Siberia Railroad.Memorable places along the way include Turkey, Iran, India, Vietnam (during the tail-end of the war, no less), Malaysia, and Burma. He talks to lots of people along the way, while during the longer stops, giving lectures that help pay his way along.By the time he's taking the seemingly endless ride across Russia, we start to see him crack, as his weariness of travel ticks in. He's increasingly open in describing his less than honorable behavior. I had read that his marriage ended over this book, and yeah, you can see how that would happen. Both because he's away from his family for over four months and because he describes his visits to brothels and sex shows, and the occasional indulgence in drugs.

Marley's shade told Scrooge it was too late for him, but that Scrooge might yet be redeemed from his life of stinginess. The Ghost of Christmas Past showed Scrooge a few scenes from his past. These scenes, with great economy, showed the bare bones of entire wasted, yet redeemable life. Jon Clinch, in this novel, adds flesh to these scenes, and we come to know Fan, Belle, Marley, and Scrooge a lot better.What actions damned Marley to carry his own chains? And did he ever stand poised on the knife-blade between damnation and redemption? This book, if it doesn't answer that question definitively, will give you something to think about or discuss in that regard.As a reader, sometimes I outsmart myself. I saw from the beginning that Clinch was throwing around the names of some literary characters known to me. So I suspected I was playing a game of figuring out which other literary worlds intersected with this one. Turns out I was off-base. Clinch was doing something else entirely. Something no less clever and cagey.It's no spoiler, if you know your Dickens, that Marley doesn't get his redemption. Still, there's quite an emotionally affecting scene near the end, that poignantly exposes how certain elements of Marley's character might have saved him.

It's hard to believe that Moore and O'Neill's first installments came out over twenty years ago.Since that time, the cast of characters has expanded to include characters from Renaissance literature, as well as twentieth century movies, science fiction, and comic books. The Tempest is a wrap-up to the entire shared mythos Moore and O'Neill have created and seemingly a kiss-off (by Moore) to the medium of comic books, as he pursues other forms of creative expression. The series has reached a point where elements of parodic humor and rampant Easter eggs have overpowered the suspenseful storytelling and character work of the early installments. It's still entertaining in a nerdly ""spot the reference"" way, but the page-turning excitement is gone.That's too bad. Moore's cleverness in the past always was in the service of telling a story. His weakest work was always cleverness for cleverness's sake, and that's what this is. I hope that in the future he treats us to more engrossing stuff, in the vein of his recent prose novel Jerusalem and his and Jacen Burrows' comics project Providence, both of which were exceptional.I'll be on hand to read the final issue of The Tempest, but I expect more rib-poking inside jokes for fiction mavens rather than the conclusion of a rousing story.I think my favorite thing about The Tempest has been the ""letters page"" at the end, which parodies the letter columns of superhero comics.

He's a master of disguise, speaks most known languages, can see in the dark, and he has a similar narrow focus on justice.However, whereas Batman is a protector of the innocent, the Count of Monte Cristo acts recklessly, and is willing to harm whoever gets in the way of his vengeance. At least until--well, I won't spoil it. I'll just note that there were many points in reading this book when I felt a certain amount of contempt for Dantès and his methods. Even when he fancies himself as being benevolent toward his friends, he seems quite cruel. But the fact that he can't really be pigeonholed as good or evil adds to the excitement of the book. He's a man made into a force of nature by adversity.There's a lot of adventure, intrigue, and plot packed into this big book. Piracy, banditry, dueling, con men, the risks of high finance, romantic love, hashish, the ruins and pageantry of Rome, the high society of Paris, dark dungeons. I found fascinating the description of early telegraphs, which were not electronic, but visible signals passed from tower to tower across the miles. Also, it was interesting the way a same sex relationship between two characters was portrayed. It was coded, not named directly, but apparent to the perceptive reader. And it was presented, I thought, without judgment. Two young women who wanted to make their way in the world together without the strictures of having to be married to a man.

Those who like series characters such as Harry Bosch and Jack Reacher should definitely check out IQ's adventures.In this installment, IQ and his ""scoobies"" go up against a former CIA spook and his gang of Abu Ghraib torturers, armed with the latest tech and information access. Isaiah relies primarily on his brain (deductive reasoning in the mold of Sherlock Holmes), his fast-talking friend Dodson, the dog Ruffin, and sometime ally Deronda. He also has a group of ""irregulars"" in the form of a middle school science club, and a new love interest who provides strong backup.The main plot-line is riveting, the principle subplot is a funny caper, and there are a few sub-sub-plots. I don't want to give anything away, but I found the dispatch of IQ's previous ""arch-enemy"" a bit perfunctory, although Ide has possibly set up IQ with a far more competent and frightening foe for future installments. One secondary character is transparently based on the Damon Wayans character Oswald Bates, who uses big words without knowing what they mean. Derivative, but amusing.

She never went to school, and her ""home schooling"" amounted to little more than learning to read.She recalls family members suffering horrifying disfigurement and deadly injuries without access to any other treatment than her mother's homeopathic herbalism. Her youth is laden with life-threatening abuse from her sadistic brother, and subsequent gaslighting when her family tries to tell her it never happened.She tells how she managed to get her GED and get accepted into BYU, and later studies at Cambridge and Harvard, receiving a Ph.D. in history. But still, her family calls her to reconcile on their terms, to accept their religious practices, and their version of reality, which says her brother never did the things she and others remember him doing.It would be very easy to compartmentalize the willful ignorance and outright craziness of this family by herding them into subcategories. But this country has many, many ""cults of ignorance"", and they are hell bent on tearing down science and scholarship in favor of a warped conventional wisdom. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"May 09, 2018","May 25, 2018","May 09, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35133922-educated

Le Guin is able to accomplish in less than two hundred pages what other writers take a thousand pages to do. Unlike other fantasy realms that feature one vast continent, Earthsea is an island archipelago that has just as much land mass, but requires seafaring to get from place to place. Ged (psst...don't tell anyone that's his name) is a young wizard coming into his power and facing his own personal darkness.This book will whet your appetite for more tales of Earthsea.

His story goes viral and he becomes the subject of an investigation by the Catholic Church on whether his restored movement is a miracle. He also becomes the subject of a reality TV show and a medical investigation.One thing I appreciated was how well Miles sketched out the circumstances of the characters' various lives in the beginning of the book, and led us, by writerly sleight of hand, to believe we know the whole story. We don't. There is much, much more to be teased out. A neat trick.The book is, however, wholly fictional. The contrivance of making it seem like narrative nonfiction adds another layer to the different levels of reality we experience, as Cameron's life is viewed through different scientific, religious, political, showbiz, and other lenses by the characters and the world at large.The fifth star I withheld is because, at the end of the book, Cameron still seemed a bit of a cipher to me. Maybe that was intentional. Maybe the reader is supposed to use Cameron as an empty vessel to fill with whatever qualities they want to identify with. But in the end, his unknowability dulls the story's emotional impact somewhat. That's a quibble.

Enough crimes and suspects to keep your head spinning, but the loose ends all tie up satisfactorily in the end. I have one quibble in the depiction of the law. In the story, a juvenile on trial for murder in Vermont is told she would be tried as an adult and would have to go to prison ""in Oklahoma"". What? The murder would have been a state offense, not federal, and therefore, if convicted, she would have served time in a Vermont prison.I think sometimes people don't realize that each state has its own penal system for crimes committed therein. Or somehow they confuse ""state"" and ""federal"" with ""misdemeanor"" and ""felony"", as if the more serious crimes are federal crimes and the less serious ones are state crimes. No. That's not how it works.Anyway, aside from this little jarring (to me) episode, it was a good read....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Mar 31, 2018","Apr 07, 2018","Mar 31, 2018",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/33544904-the-names-of-dead-girls

I'll say this right out front--the characters aren't realistically drawn. They're larger-than-life heroes. Or villains. Or sidekicks. Or mysterious beings. But that's not why you come to a book like this.You come to be transported to a different world. Strange races. Different societies with different codes of conduct. Weird plant and animal life. Forgotten lore. Historical mysteries. Magic powers. Bloody combat. You'll find all of that, along with mysteries: some that are revealed, only to have other mysteries lurking behind them. The magic, with its built-in limits of drawing and using power, seems believable.I had read about halfway through Sanderson's Mistborn trilogy and was bothered by the fact that a withered, sick land without agriculture was still able to sustain a rather large population. In this book, I don't have that quibble. The weird ecosystem feels like it could exist.I hope the subsequent volumes excite me as much. So far, I'm really enjoying the ride.Edit: I'm almost finished with the second volume, Words of Radiance, and I'm going to take back what I said about the characters not being realistically drawn.
