But please go and order an audiobook because TOM HANKS is fantastic, impeccable, meticulous narrator. (Yes, he is our Danny boy). So as a result paperback version: 4 stars Audiobook: 5 stars Let’s rounded 4.5 up to 5 celebration of master story telling stars!I started to read the book and I was about to give four stars ! Please, don’t get me wrong, I love the writing and those vivid characters, I was about to give million slaps to one of them: Yes, EVIL STEPMOM ANDREA, I’m talking about you! But slow pace and too many jumping between time lines a little exhausted me. But as soon as I learned Tom Hanks is on the board, I stopped reading and I started listening to the book with a huge smile on my face. Danny and Maeve will always stay on my mind and heart as amazing siblings. Their mother abandoned them. (Actually she was another version of Mother Theresa and she rejected to live in a mansion when too many poor people suffer out there so she left the place. She still loved her husband and she didn’t intend to leave her children. Her belief as social responsibilities always come first even it means to neglect her own family is irritated me so much! I’m not quite fan of this character. But thanks God, we have evil stepmother to hate more!) And their father passed away when he was only 53. They both lost their parents at young age but what they didn’t know they would be also homeless with great scheme her stepmother dearest had planned details with her lawyer. She got the control of the business of their father and she got the Dutch House to live with her two daughters. So she kicked her step kids out. She even tried to prevent Danny take money from trust fund for his education because Danny chose an expensive school and her own daughters couldn’t get the highest education they need, if all the money would spend for Danny’s needs. (At least her attempts were stopped by their father’s lawyer this time. I think Andrea deserved a special place in hell but in my opinion, hell would be like a spa treatment for her!) So all the losses they suffered, keep united this brother and sister against the entire world. They became each other’s priorities and supported each other for every big life decisions. (Maeve helped him to connect with his future wife even they didn’t get along for a long time and resented each other!) They grew up, but they resumed going to the Dutch House and stopped their cars in front of the place, waited to see any activity around or inside and they left. THAT BECAME THEIR ROUTINE FOR YEARS like visiting an old relative they check randomly to make sure she’ still alive!Years passed, they got old. They resumed going back there…Till one day their mother returned back and requested them to drive her to the house and finally she bangs on the door to meet with Andrea. That is the beginning of some endings! The house was like a living and functioning organism marked the milestones of the sibling’s lives and changed them forever. Past and future combined with sadness, regrets, resentments, sister and brother’s devotion, marriage, nostalgia, childhood memories, unfinished businesses, yearning for real and functional family, life decisions.  As the life moved on , two siblings’ a special piece of their hearts always stayed with that house, buried there, even they thought they moved on but they couldn’t. Because house gave them hope that one day their mother could return. House made them grow up earlier. House made them connect with their maids, nanny ( also mistress of their father) and many childhood happy memories. Even they’ve kicked out, they have never left the place and the house never left them, too. It left a vulnerable scar on their mind and soul. It always stayed with them till the end of their lives.Amazing story-telling, remarkable characterization and best narration!bloginstagramfacebooktwitter"
1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30181442-yun,Rating 3 out of 5," The Dutch House starts out strong, but then ultimately doesn't go anywhere.We are introduced to siblings Danny and Maeve, the center of this family saga. Their father strikes it rich and buys a lavish mansion known as The Dutch House as a surprise for their mother. That event reverberates with repercussions for everyone in the family and kicks off a five decade long story.This is my first Ann Patchett, and I've heard amazing things about her, so I tore into this book with gusto. And I was hooked from the first page. I found the characters and the writing to be riveting and was thoroughly enthralled with where this story was going. But then about a third of the way into it, a big turning point happened. And after that, well, I didn't really see the point of the story anymore. The writing remained interesting, but the characters and their actions stopped making sense to me. The story kind of fizzled out and then limped along without a clear narrative for the rest of the book.Usually, even if I don't connect with a story, I can still guess what the author is trying to say. But in this case, I'm stumped. Perhaps it's the message that forgiveness is key no matter how egregious the wrong? But that doesn't make sense to me, so I honestly don't know.The writing is still compelling enough that it helped carry the story through to the end, so I was never bored. But the last two thirds shambled along without momentum or purpose, and was utterly forgettable. It feels like I read a short story that reached its conclusion and then continued on for 200 more meandering pages."
2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1151637-roxane,Rating 4 out of 5,"This was an absorbing read even though the narrator was infuriating, self-absorbed, oblivious, selfish, and annoying. It follows two siblings, Danny and Maeve, and their childhood home, The Dutch House, across decades with a mother who disappeared, an emotionally distant father, his new wife and her daughters and, eventually, Danny’s wife and children. There is an epic feel to this novel but it is also an intimate portrait of siblings who have found home in each other when they are failed by the adults who were supposed to nurture them. Patchett is a formidable novelist. She takes such care with her storytelling. She creates an indelible sense of place and the narrative does some interesting things with chronology. "
3,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4685500-angela-m,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5 starsSometimes in a novel, a place is such a strong and integral part of the story that it deserves as much attention as if it were a character. The house in this novel exerts so much influence over the lives of the characters, sometimes more so than the other people in their lives. The house, with its big windows and ornate design is a symbol of success for Cyril Conroy, the self made real estate developer. To his wife Elna, it is everything that is wrong with the world, when so many others have nothing. To their children, Maeve and Danny, it is where they live. As adults, it’s much more complex; it represents everything they lost. To Conroy’s second wife Andrea, it’s a possession she has to have. Narrated by Danny, the story moves back and forth from their childhood over decades, a family saga of sorts, but the Conroy family for most of the novel is just the two of them, Danny and Maeve. This is in so many ways about the past, the past they can’t let go of, the past that shapes who they become as adults. “Do you think it’s possible to ever see the past as it actually was?” Danny asks his sister Maeve. “ I see the past as it actually was,” Maeve said. Danny responds “ But we overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know, so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.” ** It’s also about sibling love and sacrifice as the brilliant Maeve gives up so much of her life to care for Danny, to make sure he is okay. I was so emotionally connected to them and I loved their relationship. It was at times heartbreaking to see how deep seated these wounds of the past are for both of them .The plot, which captured me from the beginning is one the reader should discover for themselves, so no spoilers here. The bottom line is that I loved pretty much everything about the book - the writing, the characters, the story. I found it nearly perfect and it is 4.5 stars because of something in the end that I found hard to reconcile. I keep a list of favorite writers and Ann Patchett has been on that list for quite a while now. I’ve read every novel she’s published. Her characters always feel fully developed and making an emotional connection is easy because she allows us to know them. Definitely recommended! I read this with Diane and Esil as one of our ongoing buddy reads and as always appreciate their thoughts.**Quotes are from the advanced copy.I received an advanced copy of this book from HarperCollins through Edelweiss."
4,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5211606-julie-g,Rating 3 out of 5,"Reading Road Trip 2020Current location: Pennsylvania“Swear to God, you really were that boring.”The night my book club discussed Ann Patchett's Bel Canto some ten years ago, I clutched my copy of that novel to my chest like a companion animal and huffed and puffed away, defensively, every time a woman in the group grumbled “so unbelievable” and “that ending!” Who were they, those wenches, to speak ill of a book I adored about love and opera? Later, on various telephone calls, my sister (another devoted reader and reviewer) frequently gave the beast a poke, belaboring, yet again, my recommendation of Bel Canto to her. Why had I recommended this far flung tale of messy plot points and undeveloped characters to her?Harrumph.Then came the night at book club when we discussed Patchett's State of Wonder. I was so stricken with jungle love, I was practically sitting there with my Pinot Noir, burning up with malaria. When one of the ladies mentioned the COMPLETELY IMPLAUSIBLE ending, I felt a small flutter of doubt in my heart. . . yes, it's true, the ending was bad, but, but, but. . . The jungle! Okay, there was the scene with that kid and that scene on the dock that made absolutely no sense, but, but. . . The jungle!So, I started The Dutch House with a big smile on my face. I even purchased a new hardcover copy (almost unheard of for me), and jumped right in to Patchett's characteristically readable prose and her memorable one-liners.Oooooh, a mansion! Well, that's as appealing as an opera house or a jungle that holds the promise of sex!But the doubts came quickly with this one. Why were the two protagonists, siblings Maeve and Danny, just sitting outside the house like two cardboard cutouts? Why weren't we ever getting inside their heads, instead of having the story narrated TO US? Was I ever going to know these two people? Was this, like, a play?Wait, wait. . . why were they still sitting there, but two pages ago they were teens and now one is married and the other is graduated and working now. Wait, wait. . . he has kids? But I never even knew him to kiss a girl! Was this, like, a play about time travel?And then. . . when the 53-year-old father, Cyril Conroy, dies and leaves his two motherless children without a will. . . well, folks, I CRIED FOUL. I looked right at my book and declared NO.Not only was Cyril Conroy a REAL ESTATE MOGUL worth God knows how much money, one of his best friends was a LAWYER who not only had drawn up a very detailed educational trust for his kids. . . but Mr. Conroy, being the owner of so many buildings in Pennsylvania and New York, was, in fact, so legally minded, that he once “paid a man from the American consulate to meet [their mother's] ship in Bombay. He'd mailed the divorce papers and the man took my mother straight to the consulate and had her sign them in front of a notary.” And, get this, the next line is: “ALL VERY LEGAL.” (page 288, in case you're interested in details)Cyril Conroy was known for being a stickler, the type of man who crossed his “i's” and dotted his “t's.” This was not a man who would be remiss in having his lawyer draw up a very thorough will for his motherless children.To quote Maeve from the book: “Did that really happen?”To quote Danny from the book: “Are you making this up?”As far as I am concerned, the entire premise of this story is tragically flawed, right from the start. The novel, in my opinion, also makes the mistake of being approximately 100 pages too long, and suffers from almost no real character development. As readers, we are TOLD everything, like a Greek tragedy, narrated aloud. We SEE almost nothing here, but two mannequins sitting in a car, exchanging some clever dialogue.I will tell you this: I will not be the reader with stars in her eyes, when my book club discusses this one."
5,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38610813-paromjit,Rating 4 out of 5,"Ann Patchett's latest novel proves to be a absolute delight to read with its echoes of the darkest of fairytales with the requisite wicked stepmother in the form of Andrea. We are provided with Patchett's acute understanding and keen observational insights of what it is to be human, the complex nature of family and the dysfunctional dynamics that proliferate. Shortly after WW2, Cyril Conroy's life catapults from poverty into wealth which propels him to buy the architectural jewel that is the Dutch House with its many windows in the Pennsylvania suburbs for his wife, Elna, a house that is to splinter his family apart. As the narrative moves back and forth in time through five decades, the house turns out to be an integral part and trigger for the dramas that ensue, the highs and the lows. Danny grew up with little memory of his mother who left so early in his life, and his father is a distant figure, contributing to the strong bond with his older sister, the bright and determined Maeve, a woman of substance who takes on the mantle of caring and protecting him. Cyril brings Andrea into the lives of Maeve and Danny, and goes on to marry her. Andrea, with her children, is driven by ambition that inform her behaviour and decisions, catalysts for how events pan out in the house and family interactions until Cyril's dies, leaving Andrea with everything. Andrea reacts by throwing Maeve and Danny out. The siblings are pushed out of their privileged and comfortable lives, finding themselves facing a life of poverty and challenges with only each other to rely on. Maeve dedicates her life to Danny at the expense of her own life and ambitions, with both positive and negative outcomes, although their future lives are to be shaped by their constant obsession with the house and their inability to let go of the past.Patchett writes a compulsive novel of family, sibling relationships, secrets, memories that can so often turn out to be unreliable, coming to terms with what life can throw at you, grief, loss, love and forgiveness. It is beautifully written, with rich, atmospheric vibrant descriptions and with Patchett's stellar and skilful characterisation and development, she has an uncanny capacity to give us pictures of emotional and meaningful depth of her characters interior lives. This is a brilliant, thought provoking, multilayered, complicated and well crafted book infused with a wryness and humour that made it such a memorable read. Many thanks to Bloomsbury for an ARC."
6,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32879029-emma,Rating 4 out of 5,"Hang on, I swear I’m about to write this review, but first I need to call up every real estate agent in the greater Philadelphia area and inquire about purchasing the Dutch House.Okay, so yes, the Dutch House is fictional.Plan B: I will make millions and millions of dollars and then become best friends with Ann Patchett and she and I will team up as co-architects to construct a real life version, and both of us will ignore the fact that we have no architecture experience and that I haven’t taken an actual math class in about 6 years (long story) and also that the Dutch House as a literary symbol brings only suffering and obsession.I’m sure I’ll figure it out. I’m an English major, so according to my calculations, making millions of dollars will take me...476 years.We’ve got time.Until then, I will think about this book. To keep me motivated and inspired.I will think about how it is beautifully written, and so real and emotive and human, and how I FELT everything that happened in this book. How it all felt real and painful and true.I will think about how I love Maeve, and I love Danny, and I love May and Kevin and Celeste, and I love Sandy and Jocelyn, and how I even love Norma and Bright.Mostly, I will think about the Dutch House, and the borderline grotesque beauty of the dining room, and the big portraits in the living room, and the windowseat in the best bedroom, and the seating area at the top of the stairs, and the warm kitchen, and the cold high-up beds.And those 476 years will just fly by.Bottom line: Immediately after finishing this book, I resolved to read everything by Ann Patchett.----------------pre-reviewactually i grew up in the Dutch House and the characters from this book are my family and this is the story of my life.review to come / 4.5 stars----------------tbr reviewi promise eventually i'll move on from gazing lovingly at this cover and actually open this book"
7,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11296522-fatma,Rating 2 out of 5,"3 stars if im feeling generous, which im not, so 2.5 stars it isthis was so blah. no word encapsulates this book for me more perfectly than ""blah."" i recognize that this book had some nice, touching moments, but on the whole it felt so heartless. after about the first quarter of this book, this started becoming very apparent. the dutch house reminded me of all the things i disliked about mary beth keane's ask again, yes and jhumpa lahiri's the namesake: the reliance on having a character tell us the plot as opposed to us seeing it unfold; the huge time jumps that leave characters in the most boring, cookie-cutter lives, in stark contrast to their initially compelling childhoods. like i dont know how many times i have to read about time jumps where interesting characters end up married to some wishy-washy character whose only function is to be of the opposite sex so that the main character can get married to them and have the compulsory 2 kids and white picket fence. can we not think of literally anything that's more interesting ? like anything ? ill even take 3 kids instead of the usual 2. WRITERS, PLEASE, TRY HARDERit goes without saying that where the first quarter of this book was compelling for me, the other two-thirds completely lost me. what i was invested in were the family dynamics, the brother-sister relationship. what i was not invested in was seeing danny take college courses and hang out with his (painfully boring) girlfriend and do random real-estate things that i could not care less about. (and by the way, celeste's whole character just reeked of the ""im not like other girls"" trope. i know she's peripheral to the story, but she's never her own character, not even a little bit. she exists exclusively in relation to and for danny.) i also didnt really think that the characters' motivations made all that much sense. andrea was barely anything much more than an Evil, Gold Digging Step Mom. and all the animosity between celeste and maeve felt extremely unfounded, not to mention very annoying.reading this book was just one long downward trajectory. the more i read it the more it irritated me till finally at the end i was like okay i definitely dont like this book."
8,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse-walters,Rating 5 out of 5,"E-book - ( own)... and Audiobook.... ( own), narrated by Tom Hanks. Having read and loved other books by Patchett, [“Commwealth”, “Bel Canto”, “State of Wonder”, “This Is The Story of A Happy Marriage”, and “Run”], plus all the raving early reviews - I was looking forward to reading this. And now I’ve joined the choir with other readers and friends singing....“This is a wonderful novel”. I pre-ordered the ebook months ago - soon to learn that my High School boyfriend- [haha]- Tommy Hanks - was reading the Audiobook....so I purchased the Audiobook as well. TOM HANKS was FLAWLESS in reading this novel. Man, he made this book come alive!!! Tom was so darn good - it was easy to be fooled that he was reading his own memoir. Mixing a gifted author with the enormously talented actor, is like finding a FRUIT LOOP in a bowl of CHEERIOS.....( Danny did eat Cheerios for breakfast in this story).Tom Hanks, as narrator, ( cast as Danny Conroy ), delivers Ann Patchett’s novel’s as if he ‘is’ Danny. Hank disappears - and what we are left with is this bright, funny, kid/guy: Danny!!Danny’s devotion to his sister, Maeve, (7 years older than him), is deeply moving. Their relationship is major and memorable. Danny was innocent - uniformed - unenlightened - incognizant in ways - yet when it came to his sister, Maeve, he knew more about her than anyone. He was always looking at her - observing her - loving her - immensely loyal to her. “The story of my sister, was the only story I was meant to tell”....says Danny. “The Dutch House” is a brother-sister psychodrama about wealth, loss of family, sibling loyalty, anger, desire, resentment, love, forgiveness, etc. Danny and Maeve grew up in a luxurious mansion outside of Philadelphia, known as the Dutch House.....(named for previous owners cigarette moguls of Dutch heritage). The details of the house - the descriptions of the rooms - the cook & housekeeper - the family complexities- of mother - father - stepmother - siblings - wives - sickness - college - marriage - divorce - emotional attachments - abandonment - sadness - hope -past & future - is exquisitely impactful. As the story moves along, the house feels like another character. I came to see ‘the house’ as synonymous with family - heartbreaks-and heartwarming. Patchett’s storytelling is bighearted and smart. It’s one of those books that seems to be alive.... with a beating heartbeat. Ann Patchett is an expert at exploring psychological depths beneath the surface of her characters. Every character was easy to imagine. Ann Patchett shared what sparked her narrative for ‘The Dutch House’. She said.... “The Book really started with me thinking about a person who didn’t want to be rich. There’s so much celebration around money, and I thought, ‘what if somebody just wanted to walk away from it all?’ I began thinking about the repercussions of one person‘s decision — how one person‘s decision really changes the path of so many lives. When Danny and Maeve lost the house, she couldn’t get over it. And I think that’s true for a lot of us. Something has happened in our lives, and even if our lives go on to be quite wonderful, we hang on to the hurt.”5 fabulous stars! "
9,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63168028-peter,Rating 4 out of 5,"AttachedThe Dutch House is a story of siblings, Danny and Maeve Conroy, their obsessive connection with the iconic family house they lived in as young children and how their lives unfolded over the years. The story is narrated by Danny over multiple non-linear time periods. The various time jumps and reflections back to important events felt like a jigsaw puzzle being built, where there is the uncertainty of the next piece but once it is placed, the complete picture becomes clearer and clearer. This is a wonderful skill Ann Patchett possesses as I never feel lost or confused as she managed the time transitions so deftly. The other major hallmark of Ann Patchett is her development of amazing characters and relationships. Maeve is Danny’s older sister of 7 years, she is very intelligent, a diabetic, caring to the extreme for her brother, and a character that fascinates and frustrates at times. Danny is much more emotionally reserved and his development into adulthood is interesting to watch. While he takes advantage of top-class education in medicine he can’t shake his love for his father’s business in real estate. Their mother is a memory, having left them when they were young and the story starts with their father bringing Andrea home to visit. Andrea eventually becomes his wife, their new mother and the force that shapes the future relationships within the family.
 “Mothers were the measure of safety, which meant that I was safer than Maeve. After our mother left, Maeve took up the job on my behalf but no one did the same for her.” 
 It’s not too long before Andrea's own two daughters become her sole focus and ambition, and the existing family and staff are unwelcome reminders of a past she wasn’t part of. Andrea is dispassionate, harsh, and greedy, and heir to the Dutch House mansion. Early in the marriage “It also seemed pretty clear he had married the wrong woman. If we all kept to our own corners it was easier for everyone.”After only a few years of marriage, their father dies and leaves the house and business to Andrea who repays his memory by putting both Maeve and Danny out, to never set foot in their home again. This starts an obsessive periodic pilgrimage for Danny and Maeve where they return to the street to sit in a car parked across from the Dutch House and gaze at it recalling memories and wondering how life would have panned out – if only. The emotional baggage they carry together drives them forward but also restricts their successes and paths taken. The psychological burden of seeking happiness and fulfilment, while tied to past commitments and motivations is cleverly layered throughout the story.What I had difficultly with was that I didn’t feel any great pace in the novel and at times wished it would move along in a more compelling rate. The house, while a connecting point, didn’t really have any character and increasingly the story is told away from it. It may be suggested that the house is the central aspect of the story but I would disagree feeling it more appropriate to consider the deep, caring, loving and supportive relationship between a brother and sister growing up with only each other to depend on and if that connection in itself had a restricting effect on how their lives developed. Their real mother returns to the story very late in the book and I just found her motivations, and supposed wisdom, very difficult to accept and jarred so much that it left a frustration with the novel.I would recommend this book and I’d like to thank Bloomsbury Publishing and NetGalley for providing me with an early ARC copy in return for an honest review."

11,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/260116-janb-vacation-and-off-line-till-mid-october,Rating 3 out of 5,"2.5 stars:Danny and Maeve are siblings who can’t overcome their past. Abandoned by their mother at an early age, Maeve, the oldest, assumes the mother role. Everything changes further when their emotionally distant father marries the evil stepmother and the children are cut out of their inheritance. The pain, bitterness, and anger shapes their personalities and their future. How do they move past such a childhood? My questions: What does forgiveness look like? Does forgiveness mean you allow toxic people back into your life? Is that healthy? What is required of the person(s) who did you wrong? I have my own thoughts about these issues but you’ll have to read the book and decide for yourself. Commonwealth is one of my favorite books and this was one of my most anticipated books of the year. The first 75% was riveting reading. But the story took a turn that I found unrealistic and ridiculous. I can’t say more without spoilers but I’m glad I could vent to my reading buddy Marialyce. I’ve tried to discern the author’s purpose in writing this book and it either escapes me or it’s one I can’t buy into. * I received a copy of the book via Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review* for our duo review of this and other books please visit https://yayareadslotsofbooks.wordpres..."
12,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1277371-marialyce-back-in-the-usa,Rating 2 out of 5,"This was a book I had to think about after finishing. I truly wanted to fall into a deep and abiding love for the story and yet I found it so unrealistic that I had to question what if any was the motive behind the story. There seemed to be no overwhelming meaning to the characters. Everyone and everything seemed disjointed and to me a wash of grey characters, not believable and certainly not ones to be emulated. From the dereliction of being a mother, a father who is in all intents absentee, to the relationship of brother and sister and a step family, I could not get a firm grasp on what the author was trying to say. It was a big disappointment for I am one to accept stories with messages not however messages that are murky if not obscure. It was like going on a roller coaster waiting for the biggest and tallest hill and then there was none. Left to a stilted somewhat boring ride, you emerge with no sense of wonder but a sense of what the heck was that and where was my thrill?So here I will sit with a not so favorable outlook on this story. I have liked three of this author's books, particularly the book, Commonwealth, but unfortunately for me this book left be feeling as vacant and bereft as her characters seemed to be. 2.5 stars for me as well. What represents you as a person? Is it the people you know, the clothes you wear, or even the house you live in? Could it be in one's zeal to be acknowledged that the aforementioned things are really what makes the persona a person wishes to put forward. What happens to character, to strength, and to the willingness to help others, particularly family, as the components of what makes a person? In this book, Ann Patchett presents us with a family whose lives are tragic shells of what could have been. But is that enough to know, for in every tragedy there always emerges victors and perhaps in this book there are no victors whatsoever just losers in the game of life.

13,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4125660-liz,Rating 5 out of 5,"5 HUGE STARS! One of my best of 2019 (definitely the best audio book). I am a huge Ann Patchett fan and this book does not disappoint. It’s a fabulous book, but it was made so much better because of Tom Hank’s narration. The book is described as a dark fairy tale and there is definitely that theme, with an evil stepmother separating two siblings from their father, their house and everything they hold dear. The book just drew me in and I wanted to spend all my hours listening to it. Told from Danny’s viewpoint, we learn of how Andrea appears in their lives and usurps their inheritance. While I appreciated what Maeve and Danny had lost, I also kept waiting to see when they would move on with their lives. As time goes on, and it moves through five decades, the book becomes more about forgiveness and acceptance. While Maeve is often bitter, Danny at times just seems befuddled, a somewhat removed player in his own life. My thoughts about Celeste went back and forth. Maeve and Danny were so used to being each other’s emotional support, I could understood Celeste feeling left out. But her jealousy at times felt childish. Patchett’s strength comes from how she forms her characters. I never felt Danny and Maeve were anything but real flesh and blood people. In both cases, you see exactly how their childhood has made them the people they are. The same events, when seen through the difference of a few years, shapes them in unique ways. And that ending! I loved how this played out and what became of each of the main characters, how they reconciled themselves to their histories. What surprised me was how much humor was in this book. Not laugh out loud, but a subtle, dry humor that more closely mirrors real life. Again, Hanks totally captures the humor here. I hope he takes on more audio book assignments as he is so well suited to the work."
14,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s,Rating 4 out of 5,"Patchett is way up there on my, can't wait for next novel, list. Her characterizations, her insight into flawed families and her wry observations of human nature, are always top notched. In this, her soon to be published novel, she follows a family for five decades, a family that is broken apart, for reasons that I cannot at this time share. Brother and sister, Maeve and Danny, are extremely close, not unexpected since they are the only ones that are there for each other through thick and thin. Danny is our narrator, and from a young age, we are let into his thoughts and the actions of the other characters.Dutch House, a house that their father bought to surprise their mother, is as much a character in this story, as are the actual characters. It is the cause of much of what happens here, a house with huge window that allows one to see all through the house. We follow not only the house itself, but the brother and sister as they grow, through their triumphs and losses. Sibling strength and family loyalty.It is a novel of obsession but also of acceptance and forgiveness. The end, in a way comes full circle, but not without much heartache and loss. There were a few things that sparked the doubting Thomas in me, but all in all this is a wonderful read.Another read with Angela and Esil, and though our ratings do differ a bit, we all enjoyed this novel.ARC by Edelweiss."

I am not sure I will follow her, but this novel is absolutely fantastic. What an intriguing idea to tell a story of a family, especially of a strong bond between siblings, and connect it with a story of a house that seems to be in the background but which in fact plays the major role in the characters' lives! I live in a flat in a tenement house which was built over 90 years ago, love everything about it, appreciate the amount of work that went into decorting it and the attention to its quality, therefore the Dutch House at first seemed to me one of the most beautiful houses one can imagine. At the beginning I was confused: how can you hate such an architectural pearl? As the story progresses, we learn more about its former owners, how the Conroys came to own it, how Danny and Maeve were forced to leave it, and most importantly, how it influenced their mother and in consequence, the siblings. Then, I understood Ms Patchett's idea behind her story. And I loved it.For me, this was one of those novels that you start and you think you know what to expect, and then you are given a most unannounced treat."

I previously had only read Commonwealth and liked it, but it wasn't something I would climb to the top of a mountain and yell about. This book is.I'm not going to get into the summary because I went in as blind as I could (I requested an ARC on NG and EW purely on the fact that it was Ann Patchett and I LOVED the cover) and I think that benefited me. I had no expectations whatsoever. Within the first few pages I was hooked. Ms. Patchett's beautiful writing had my jaw on the floor. I am in awe of her talent and it played out so well in my mind that I was in that house with them. I was sitting next to them in the car. I was the fly on the wall. I was there.If you like books that make you feel a spectrum of emotions with a side of laughter for a few quirky characters - than this book is absolutely a MUST READ. I experienced being vehemently angry, to laughing out loud to such utter sadness...If this isn't made into a series on TV or a movie, I don't know what is wrong with people. The characters in this story (my favorite is Maeve hands down) are so complex and relatable and REAL. You hate them, you forgive them, you desperately love them. I cannot say enough good things about it. I love books that make me feel something and this one did, a million times over. Thank you to Edelweiss, Harpercollins and Ann Patchett for the opportunity to read and provide an honest review of this book.Review Date: 09/27/19Publication Date: 09/24/19"

This one is read by Tom Hanks and he makes it absolutely perfect. He has the kind of voice you can listen to for hours and it is ideal for Danny, the character whose point of view is followed throughout the book.The story is about the breakdown of a family and the support its individual members give to each other. Danny and his sister Maeve are the most important characters, and they have an amazing bond. I thought it was very interesting to observe the different ways they reacted to their lost mother. Maeve, who had known her for some of her childhood, longed for her return. Danny, who never really knew her, ended up being very like his father and repeated many of his faults. I have read several of this author's books now and have enjoyed all of them. She has a magic touch with characterisation and her books often read like top quality memoirs because the people in them are so real. The Dutch House is not plot driven or exciting. It moves slowly and beautifully and ends up almost where it began. I enjoyed it very much."
19,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7383561-holly,Rating 4 out of 5,"TOM HANKS NARRATES THIS AUDIOBOOK! I repeat, Tom Hanks narrates this audiobook! I could listen to that man narrate a grocery list but lucky for us, this book was much more interesting than that.Let me first warn you that this is absolutely a character study plot type novel. And by that I mean, don't go into this book expecting this to happen: beginning->story climax where something major happens->ending. Instead, the readers gets to wade through the lives of Danny and his older sister, Maeve. It's like literary voyeurism. This is something I personally enjoy (I even have a shelf for it!), but if that does not sound like the kind of story you want to read, you might want to skip this.Getting into the book itself - I *loved* the first 2/3 of the book, maybe even 3/4. So, as you can probably figure out, the ending is where I dropped my planned 5 star review down to a 4. I don't want to spoil any of the book, because when a book really isn't about anything in particular everything is a spoiler. But I can say that the ending left me wondering if the author was trying to tell the reader something about forgiveness and if so, I am way too much of a cynical grudge bearing asshole to jump on that forgiveness ship, both in books and in real life. So, there's that.But don't let my personal issues with the book ending dissuade you from LISTENING to this book. Because Tom Hanks. *dreamy sigh while I go watch You've Got Mail for the millionth time*"
20,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8665845-debbie,Rating 4 out of 5,"A grand house with grand siblings insideA house? Really? I want people, not inanimate objects! I thought the house would be bigger than the people in it, but thank god I was wrong. I ended up loving the place. Hell, I’d go to an open house there any day. Damn straight I’d like to snoop around.The cover and the title scared me. A painting of an uptight, upright woman on the cover, and “Dutch House” as the title—sounds like we might have some snooty going on here. Is reading this going to feel like being held prisoner in a museum? Because I’m here to tell you, museums are famous for keeping it dull, and I definitely smelled a museum. It just hit me that I wouldn’t have been putting on the brakes if the house were some funky, colorful place (with a chartreuse washstand and a periwinkle china cabinet)—in other words, a house I’d like to explore. A rich person’s house—high ceilings, mature rugs, huge art? Yawn city. But let’s face it, I would read anything Ann Patchett writes—uptight, upright, museum-y or not, I was all in. So I sighed and dug in, already mad that I was going to be dropped into dens of description! I needed an attitude adjustment, because of course this huge house, as I predicted, was being described in huge detail. Chill! I sat there all tense, poised and ready to jump ship if I had to. But immediately the writing adjusted my attitude, as Patchett did her typical skillful thing and grabbed me into her story. And we’re talking two pages in. I was hooked.This is the story of Danny and Mauve, a brother and sister who are joined at the hip. Danny is the narrator, and he’s just a kid when the story starts. I liked him immediately. Mauve takes care of Danny, and he adores her. All they have, really, is each other. When two siblings are alone against the world, they are imprinted on each other for life; the bond is greater than any other. Danny and Mauve fit the bill. Watching their devotion to each other was so touching. Their lives change suddenly (and the house is big during this fateful moment) and they need each other even more. The book follows them through five decades. As the kids became adults, I got more and more attached to them; I was invested in the choices they made and cringed more than once at their behavior. Patchett knows how to make you believe them, trust them, love them.The house is at first a grand place but all the sudden it isn’t. The house means different things to different people and it’s a constant in the book, always there for people to react to. Throughout the book, we have Danny and Mauve sitting in a car in front of the house, reminiscing. Right there, Patchett has me in the palm of her hand. Why on earth are they just sitting there? Can’t they go in? Why do they sit there time and again? Slowly the story gets revealed.I’ve been a Patchett fan for a long time, and every time I finish one of her books, I feel so completely satisfied (with the exception of Bel Canto). Yet I always sort of frown and try to figure out Patchett’s secret. Well, of course, there’s the fact that her writing is dynamite. And she creates nuanced characters, has a lot of insight into the human condition, and keeps the story moving along, usually rather quietly (there’s never over-the-top melodrama—never). Her presentation is complicated but smooth. We go back and forth in time, but she sets it up in a way that lets me happily accept the jumps.Patchett’s tone is pretty formal, which always puts me off at first because I worry it will keep me from feeling close to the characters; it will create a distance. But here’s the scoop: Maybe I can’t get super close because she’s got a wall up, but she gets me to peek over the wall to see the fascinating party she’s throwing, and it’s as good as a front-row seat. With all of her books, the formality soon becomes invisible to me and I am all in, attached to the characters and wanting to find out, right that minute, how they are going to fare. I desperately wanted to know how Danny’s and Mauve’s life would turn out. The story didn’t disappoint.In terms of scope, tone, setting, and depth, this book seems like a throwback to masterpieces written in the 1700s and 1800s; there is a classic and epic feel to it. Having a grand mansion as the setting helps. As in classics, Patchett does give lots of details of things that by themselves aren’t interesting, but she ends up painting a vivid picture that sets a perfect stage for the action going down, and you feel like you’re right there.This editor twitches a couple of times. There are a few tiny problems, which might be fixed by publication date:-Mauve’s workplace is described twice. Haven’t I read this before?-Kids don’t talk this way! Way too mature-sounding! Happened enough times to annoy me.-Common error: she said she “could have cared less” when she meant that she “couldn’t have cared less.”The reason I’m giving this book 4 stars instead of 5 is that I had trouble believing the mom. I just didn’t think what she did was realistic (plus I bigtime didn’t approve of it). Also, there is a theme of forgiveness at the end, which I also didn’t buy (or like). Even though there isn’t a religious theme going on, I think religion is a very tricky undercurrent.All in all, a good read, though. Patchett is a master.Thanks to Edelweiss for the advance copy."
21,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5872506-larry-h,Rating 4 out of 5,"""But we overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we're not seeing it as the people we were, we're seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.""Siblings Danny and Maeve Conroy grew up in The Dutch House, a lavish home in the Philadelphia suburbs. Once the home of a Dutch family that owned most of the area, their artwork and interior decorating still remain throughout the infamous estate. While their real-estate-investor father loves the house and sees it as a jewel in his empire, their mother was repulsed by all the infamous home represented, and she left when Danny was very young.Left with a father generally incapable of doing more than providing the material comforts for his children, Maeve helped raise Danny, with the help of the family's two housekeepers. The two siblings, despite their age difference, formed an unshakable bond, one which became even more crucial when their father married again, this time a younger woman with two young daughters of her own. Their stepmother's dislike of them was apparent to them from the very start, although their father seemed oblivious and/or disinterested in her treatment of them, as he was more interested in keeping the peace in his household than anything else.When their stepmother gets the opportunity, she exiles Danny and Maeve from the house—and cuts off their access to any of the money that should be theirs. Left with nothing, they are forced to fend for themselves and have only each other to survive. And while they cannot seem to get The Dutch House out of their minds, given that it was such an enormous part of their lives, they want more than anything to understand the actions of their parents, which led them to where they are now. While this isn't a suspenseful book, there are a few surprises that are better to unfold as you read it rather than have them revealed. This is a book that was paced a lot slower than I like, but there is a lot of richness to behold, including emotion, nostalgia, family dynamics, and even a little humor. What fascinated me even more is what a major character the house itself played, much like in

22,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/106692-cheri,Rating 5 out of 5,"4.5 StarsThis is the third book of Patchett’s that I’ve read, the first being State of Wonder,  the second, Commonwealth, and this is one adds to the proof that she was born to write these complex family dramas where each character equally shares the wounds of all involved.  A little like a fairy tale flipped upside-down, this story includes an imposing, castle-like house, which seems to affect each character differently, as though abiding inside these walls seems to create an entirely different relationship between the house and each character. It begins as World War II is ending, and this then poor young family who have been living in base housing, living a happy, if simple life find their world upended when the father, Cyril, buys a house – unbeknownst to his young wife and young daughter, Maeve. The wife, Elna, is… well, impressed by the house, but the impression isn’t a good one, and she can’t imagine how this house could be theirs when they are poor. Something must be wrong beyond her feeling that this is far too ostentatious for her to ever feel comfortable living in. As the story moves along, the house becomes more and more like another character, creating tension as time passes, and representing the failures of the past as well as the shattered hopes and dreams for the members of this family, as well. As time passes, it continues to pull both Danny and his sister Maeve back time and again to confront their feelings of anger and their regrets over the past. Narrated by the son, Danny, it seemed as though these were stories shared by and about real people, and imparted with the grace and dignity offered to cherished loved ones.

23,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3643764-esil,Rating 4 out of 5,"Awfully close to 5 stars!The Dutch House is full of the stuff I love in fiction. It’s really well written, has great characters, is original and feels like a big meaty story I could get lost in. Danny is the narrator. He grew up in the grandiose Dutch House with his sister, Maeve, and his father. What happens to his mother is a mystery that unravels over time. But the fallout from her disappearance is a very strong bond between Danny and Maeve, and a cascade of emotional and other consequences for everyone. At the centre of the novel is the house — loved and reviled depending on the character. In the end, there is a symmetry to the story that is emotionally wrought and complex. This is not an easy story with straightforward characters. But it’s very readable. I read this one as a buddy read with Angela and Diane, and it definitely works well as a buddy read because there’s much to discuss — especially the end. Thanks to Edelweiss and the publisher for an opportunity to read an advance copy."

From the masterful beginning until the perfect ending, and everything in between; the characters who feel like family, the Dutch house itself, the story which loops around and circles in upon itself, surprises, unexpected opportunities and also the letting go of hatred and revenge when there's no point in them anymore. I'm still not sure how I feel about the Mother, but I'll be dwelling on her for quite some time.I don't know exactly how Ann Patchett keeps on getting better and better, but she has taken grand storytelling to a new level."
26,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68708752-beverly,Rating 5 out of 5,"Ann Patchett is one of my favorite authors. I haven't read all of her books, but I have read many of them that I love with my whole heart; Bel Canto, Run, Truth and Beauty are my favorites by her. The Dutch House is a five star read too. I was completely in love with her characters, especially Maeve and her brother Danny, who are essentially made orphans and paupers by the death of their father, the desertion by their mother, and their wicked stepmother who kicks Danny out of her home when he is only 15. Maeve has to take care of Danny and herself and she does an outstanding job. This is a novel about siblings who love each other and take care of each other which is something that is very rare in books.Another theme of the book, besides family devotion is the importance of working hard and studying hard. Maeve and Danny are hard workers and believe in education for its own sake. This is another reason why I love this book. At the heart of the book is their home, the one their father bought as a gift for their mother, that she rejected. The children survive despite the loss of their home and even their wicked stepmother is toothless at the end."

For me, having had a bad childhood and a bad marriage, “Home” has always been a place. Now that I’m divorced, the first home that I created for myself after my divorce was the first place that I ever truly felt safe in my entire life. Now, having moved, I have strived to create that same feeling of “Home” elsewhere. For others, “Home” may be the people you surround yourselves with.In “The Dutch House” by Ann Patchett, “the house” as such, plays a huge part of the story and everything revolves around it. For some of the characters in this novel, I believe that home is definitely a place.Danny and Maeve Conroy are siblings who live in The Dutch House with their parents until tragedy strikes and then the unthinkable happens and Danny and Maeve’s life changes drastically. Thereafter Danny and Maeve visit The Dutch House frequently albeit from the confines of Maeve’s car. Reflecting and reminiscing. Though their lives go on and decades pass, Danny and Maeve’s lives always revolve around The Dutch House, what has transpired over the years and what goes on inside on a daily basis. Thought provoking, engaging and heartbreaking, “The Dutch House” includes a whole host of complex characters and emotions. There are several themes in this book, including: acceptance; dysfunction; family; friendship; forgiveness; love; obsession; reconciliation and perseverance, to name a few. This book will evoke emotion, whether you like it or not. Frustration, anger, disgust, joy and/or love. I was wholly engrossed in the storyline and in the characters and every time a “shoe dropped” my jaw just about dropped as well. I grabbed the audiobook of this from my library and was delighted to find that TOM HANKS was the narrator! TOM freaking HANKS!!! He did a phenomenal job narrating and completely drew me into this story. What I can say is that I truly enjoyed this story and loved the characters of Danny and Maeve. I found certain aspects of the story to be a bit unbelievable given my personal background but I enjoyed the book nonetheless. While I preferred “Commonwealth,”I did enjoy this and would recommend it to fans of literary fiction. A huge thank you to my local library for loaning me a copy of this audiobook! Thank you to Tom Hanks for the stellar narration!Published on Goodreads on 10.18.20."

30,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36348070-brandice,Rating 4 out of 5,"Ann Patchett rarely disappoints and The Dutch House is no exception. This story spans several decades, beginning with siblings Danny and Maeve, in their childhood, growing up in the Dutch House, outside of Philadelphia. The story is told entirely from Danny’s perspective. He’s very close with Maeve, his older sister, as their mother, Elna, left when the children were young. The family was well-off and their father, Cyril, though not particularly warm, provided for and raised his two children, who couldn’t got a straight answer as to why Elna left, just hearing bits and pieces through others. I was frustrated on their behalf for the lack of answers. Cyril remarries Andrea, a woman with little regard for Danny and Maeve, even though she has two daughters of her own. When tragedy strikes, Andrea kicks Danny and Maeve out of the Dutch House, redirecting the course of their lives. The siblings grow even closer as they deal with the devastating blow of being thrown out of their home and try to forge on with their new life. Is a house really a home? Does karma exist? At what point, if ever, does forgive and forget happen? These are all questions indirectly posed in The Dutch House, where the house itself is a central character in the story. I liked both Danny and Maeve though at points, I recognized why their fierce loyalty to one another could be frustrating for others. Danny bent a bit too easily to Maeve’s wishes at times. I did enjoy the subtle sarcasm of Danny’s adult POV in the story. It never ceases to amaze me how talented of a writer Ann Patchett is - I’m a big fan and continue to marvel at how she writes such great stories, none of which are alike. I appreciate the variation of settings, different characters, and that her stories do not follow a set formula. While I didn’t love The Dutch House quite as much as Commonwealth or State of Wonder, I still really liked it and found the book to be a worthy read."

32,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28819314-eric-anderson,Rating 5 out of 5,"There are some novels where I instantly feel connected to the narrator as if he were an old friend. Something about the way Ann Patchett presents her central character of Danny Conroy in her new novel “The Dutch House” hooked me to his consciousness. Maybe it's the tone of his wide-eyed innocence and ignorance as he looks back at his childhood, family life and the home he was cast out of. It's a sensibility I can relate to now that I'm in my early 40s and think back to the mysteries of my early life wondering why certain decisions were made. Danny and his sister Maeve grow up in a grand house with a prosperous father, but their mother abandoned them in their childhood. When their father marries a new woman named Andrea who brings her own two daughters into the house, the Conroy children feel themselves growing even more estranged from their aloof father. In their teenage years they are unceremoniously ousted from their family home and must fend for themselves. Danny recounts this story and the haunting way he and his sister often linger outside the house they've been cast out of ruminating about the past and the truth about their family. In a way, every adult must feel this way reflecting on what Joyce Carol Oates calls “the lost landscape” of childhood. Patchett also poses a number of tantalizing mysteries about this particular family which kept me gripped and I admire the subtle way she raises lingering questions to do with the meaning of family, belonging and home.

I've read a number of her books, saw her speak a few times, even went to her bookstore while on a work trip through Nashville. Needless to say, there was no doubt I would read this one and like it. I've yet to read anything that she writes and not like it. I still have a few of her books to read (that I have copies of, even signed copies of books) but feel like I don't want to rush. I always want to have one of her books available to read. I know it's odd. But on to The Dutch House.The Dutch House is a slow moving family story, a sad family story. The story goes back and forth in time, over five decades, telling us about the lives of Danny and Maeve Conroy. Danny and Maeve grew up, to a point, in The Dutch House. As with any Ann Patchett story, I wanted it to end a different way. Perhaps that's just me. You hear from the time when Danny and Maeve are small children, until very much later in life, and that house. The Dutch House plays such a strong role in the story, but also in the lives of anyone who has been in that house. It has this pull, this allure, that Danny and Maeve are almost, many times, living the in past and remembering their time in that house. Even though the story is one of such a fractured family, the bond between Danny and Maeve are so strong. It kept me pushing to finish to hear more.As soon as it was available, I begged my library for the audio version. I was the first to get it! Yeah! Tom Hanks narrated the story. At first, I thought I might not like the narration. I love Tom Hanks (who doesn't) but was afraid it would just not work. I thought he did a good job, sometimes I thought maybe a bit much. But I was so drawn into the story. I often listen while working in the kitchen and was looking for things to do, just so I could hear more. The story was quite slow at times but I liked it (hence 4 stars). I can't say this is my favorite of hers. Bel Canto will forever be my favorite. One I should probably re-read, or perhaps one of her's I'm savoring on my shelves will be next in line."

I loved all the characters (including the house) and how Ann Patchett portrayed them in all their humanity. Even though the story, told by Danny, the Conroy son and brother to Maeve, goes back and forth in time over five decades, I found it quite easy to follow.

With The Dutch House it took me nearly two weeks to work up the ‘courage’ to review it. The fact is that I loved The Dutch House so much that I find hard to see it as a ‘mere’ work of fiction.This is the eighth novel that I’ve read by Ann Patchett and she has yet to disappoint. It is difficult to ‘pick’ a favourite, even if I can see that throughout the course of her writing career she has really honed her craft. Yet, I wholeheartedly loved her early books (especially her unjustly underrated 1997 novel, The Magician's Assistant), so to imply that she ‘keeps getting better’ would be doing her a disservice. Regardless of the scope of her stories (whether they take place in a short period of time in a particular city, such as in Run, or move us between two ‘extremes’, in The Magician's Assistant we move between Los Angeles and Nebraska, or take us on even longer journey, for instance in State of Wonder we follow Dr. Marina Singh’s as she leaves Minnesota for the Amazon Rainforest) Patchett tends to explore the same themes: there is a focus on familial relationships, especially between siblings, and these established dynamics are often changed due to some ‘major’ event (often the death of a loved one/relative/colleague). Although The Dutch House is written in Patchett’s signature prose, which can be described as being deceptively simple it features a first-person perspective, which is a departure from her usual third-person point of view. Being inside Danny Conroy’s head makes for an immersive experience and within the first pages I was captivated by his story. Through an act of retrospection Danny looks back to the past and what follows is a narrative that could be described as a bildungsroman. Danny’s childhood in the Dutch House—a large, if not incongruous, mansion in a prosperous suburb of Philadelphia—is clouded by the absence of his mother (a woman he cannot clearly recall but whose absence he nonetheless feels) and by his relationship with his remote father. It is Maeve, Danny’s older sister, who takes on the role of ‘parental’ figure, and their relationship is very much the underlying thread of the story. The Dutch House, weighed down by its history, inspires fascination in Andrea, the woman who will go on to become Danny and Maeve’s step-mother. The novel begins in fact with Danny’s memory of his first meeting with Andrea, one that seems to have almost a fairy-tale-esque quality in that it was the day where ‘everything’ seemed to change.Throughout Danny’s narrative we will also see the way in which the Conroy siblings remain drawn to the house, a house which seems to acquire an emblematic role in the lives of those who have lived in: it represents their childhoods, their father—his career, his marriage(s)—and the rather unfortunate VanHoebeeks. Patchett renders this house without loosing herself in extensive architectural descriptions, rather she brings to the foreground some of its features (Maeve's windowseat) and some of its objects. The paintings within the house (Maeve's portrait and those of the VanHoebeeks) also seem to hold a certain function in Danny's recollection of his past.“Maybe it was neoclassical, though with a simplicity in the lines that came closer to Mediterranean or French, and while it was not Dutch, the blue delft mantels in the drawing room, library, and master bedroom were said to have been pried out of a castle in Utrecht and sold to the VanHoebeeks to pay a prince’s gambling debts. The house, complete with mantels, had been finished in 1922.”In his remembrance Danny frequently makes vague, if not downright oblique, allusions to later events or revelations, which in turn creates tension between his past and present. Also framing Danny's recollection of his youth are a series of scenes in which he sits in alongside Maeve in her car just outside the Dutch House.Danny also questions the veracity of his memories: “But we overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.” He reassess certain moments and figures of his past, finding hidden complexities in what had at first appeared to be seemingly unremarkable occurrences.“Do you think it’s possible to ever see the past as it actually was?”While the novel is narrated by Danny he never paints himself as the ‘hero’ of his own story. He often wonders whether he should have acted in a different way towards someone or something, trying to understand why things unfurled the way that they did. While the motivations of other characters might escape him-and possibly us-they are never reduced to a certain role/function. The each have a story even if we are not always made privy to it. An although there is an awareness of the limitations provided by Danny's narration, the story never feels restricted to his experiences and worldview. “Whatever romantic notions I might have harbored, whatever excuses or allowances my heart had ever made on her behalf, blew out like a match.”My edition of The Dutch House includes an essay in which Ann Patchett says that “for a long time I had planned to call the book Maeve as it was her story.” The novel, in fact, very much pivots around Maeve but it is her brother who is telling her tale.We see the way in which their experiences in the Dutch House makes them determined to fulfil their desires or to take a certain path in their life: for Danny that is to become, as his father before him, a real-estate developer, while Maeve wants to carry on working a job she loves even if many consider her to be overqualified to do. While to some degree Danny's vision of Maeve influences our perception of her, we are always aware that she may have hidden qualities. What is certainly undeniable is her love for her brother. Their bond is portrayed with such frankness and poignancy as to become vividly real in the reader’s mind.This a story full of beauty and sorrow. There are regrets, wonderful reflections on memory, moments that are brimming with love or sadness...Patchett spins a tale in which families fall apart or come together. It is an intimate depiction of the bond between two siblings. Time and again Danny draws strength from his relationship to his sister, and even when he begins to feel unmoored from his own life, and as he struggles trying to reconcile himself with his past, Maeve provides him with a sense of belonging.Patchett's sense of place is as detailed and evocative as ever. She seamlessly renders midcentury America through Danny's narration, evoking within me a sense of nostalgia for a country I've never even been to. And while Danny's story spans decades, it maintains its focus on the same group of people, painting an intimate portrait of Danny's friends and family....to put it simply I fell in love with it. Patchett's harmonious prose made the experience all the more beautiful, and I was so enthralled by her story and her characters that to I struggled to think of them as works of fiction.What more can I say? I think this is a masterpiece.“We had made a fetish out of our misfortune, fallen in love with it. I was sickened to realize we’d kept it going for so long, not that we had decided to stop.”Read more reviews on my blog / / / View all my reviews on Goodreads"
36,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56035852-katie,Rating 2 out of 5,"I'm relieved to get this over and done with. In England we're very familiar with novels about enchanted houses. Off the top of my head there's Brideshead Revisited, Howard's End, Wuthering Heights, Jane Eyre, To the Lighthouse, The Tenant of Wildfall Hall, I Capture the Castle. All of them much better than this American take on the theme. A brother and sister are left by their mother. She leaves to help the poor in India. An utterly unconvincing plot device which was never given credence. Their father remarries a nightmare woman. The evil stepmother was by a country mile the best character in the book but unfortunately she doesn't occupy much of it. Mostly we see the brother and sister as adults, both of whom are dysfunctional where relationships are concerned, something they share with every other character in the novel. They share an incestuous relationship in all but deed. Neither has a glamorous or creative job. And the problem for me was they simply weren't interesting. We learn little about them of interest. Why didn't Maeve, the daughter, ever have a love relationship? There's lots and lots of mundane domestic detail in this novel but little insight. There was at least one whole chapter that could have been taken out without losing any relevant information. There's also no humour. Patchett's prose is neat and tidy but without risk or adventure. The resolution was hackneyed. Objectively, it isn't a bad book (I don't think it's a particularly good one either) but when characters you're supposed to sympathise with bore and irritate you there's no getting past it."

I only understood what I'd lost."" With The Dutch House, Ann Patchett has created a story that jumps off the page. Fully realized characters and one of the BEST sibling relationships I've ever read about in 337 short pages. And it didn't need to be any longer. It was absolutely perfect.This is the story of a house and its inhabitants. It's really Danny's story most, which I loved. When I read Patchett's previous novel  Commonwealth, which I really enjoyed, I wished it had a bit more focus. It spreads itself across many more perspectives, and while the writing is strong—just as it is here—the pacing waxes and wanes as the stories unfold. In this novel, however, we only ever hear from Danny. He's an endearing, empathetic, but not always to be trusted narrator. But his qualms are understandable as he's been through childhood trauma that reverberates through decades as we follow him and his sister Maeve grow up and away from their childhood home.In ways this reminded me of  The Goldfinch—thematically, stylistically, but also with this inimitable quality of feeling. This book was a book of feelings: rage and sympathy and small joys and sorrows that make up a complicated life.Patchett has her pulse on human emotion unlike many authors, and in this novel she's both prodded the wound and provided the salve. It's quite a feat and one I'll be contemplating for a long time."
39,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4271946-jessica-woodbury,Rating 5 out of 5,"I cannot explain why Ann Patchett is so good because while I read her books, I am so engrossed and involved that I do not have the capability to figure it out. That would mean letting go of the story, slowing down or stopping, not letting myself get pulled along deeper and deeper. Her prose and her plots are often (though not always) simple. I cannot tell why I am absolutely mesmerized, I just am. It is simply something to be accepted, and something to be treasured.THE DUTCH HOUSE left me with an emotional hangover I still haven't quite recovered from a day later. It worked its slow, sneaky magic on me until I was at its mercy. At first I did not quite see where it would take me, a few plot twists surprised me, but by the last third even when I knew exactly what was going to happen I felt helpless, watching, weeping, carried along by its tide. The themes of the novel are ones that hit me very deeply, which certainly added to my experience. The mystery of parents to their children, the way we see others' mistakes so clearly and then make the very same mistakes ourselves, the way the experience inside a single family can feel drastically different to everyone in it. And on top of all of that is a question of forgiveness, its blessings and its limits. Forgiveness is something I think about a lot, as I am very very bad at it, but this story is not entirely sold on it either and the sometimes-arbitrary way we deem some people worthy of forgiveness and others absolutely undeserving is one of those tricks of human nature the novel uses to full effect.Danny, our narrator, begins the novel as a child. His mother has left so long ago he barely remembers her. His father is distant. His sister Maeve, seven years older, is his parent and his closest confidant. Their father is in real estate, and they live in the titular house, an architectural marvel in the Philadelphia suburbs in the mid-20th century, filled with the belongings of the prior inhabitants, the kind of people who have giant portraits of themselves hanging on the wall. As the novel starts, their father brings home a woman, bringing a massive change to the small family. Maeve is the center of the story, and she remains throughout Danny's life the center of his world. As their family changes and then crumbles, Maeve is all that Danny has and she is devoted to his success. While Maeve loves Danny deeply, she also uses him as a tool to take out her revenge against their stepmother, something Danny is not all that interested in doing, but he doesn't put up much of a fight. Over the years they try to learn more about their closed-off father and their missing mother, needing to build up a family mythology and a deeper understanding of how it all went wrong. By the end of the novel, this small story has taken on an epic scale. I love it when a domestic plot can take on the kinds of choices and betrayals that lead to overwhelming emotions. Patchett does that so well in this book, slowly laying the groundwork, making the stakes clear, sketching the characters in minute detail, so when you reach the end you may find yourself unable to stop reading, sobbing on the couch. (Or maybe that's just me.) A rewarding, fulfilling novel.Update: Re-read in 2023 and... it definitely didn't hit the same for me for whatever reason. This time I was so annoyed at adult Danny, rolling my eyes at how he romanticized being a landlord, frustrated at how he is constantly cared for by everyone in his life and never appreciates it. I do like the fairy tale nature of it, and Patchett is so weirdly good at jumping around in time. "

It tells the story of a brother and sister over the course of five decades.At the end of the Second World War, Cyril Conroy combines luck and a single canny investment to begin an enormous real estate empire, propelling his family from poverty to enormous wealth. His first order of business is to buy the Dutch House, a lavish estate in the suburbs outside of Philadelphia. Meant as a surprise for his wife, the house sets in motion the undoing of everyone he loves.The story is told by Cyril’s son Danny, as he and his older sister, the brilliantly acerbic and self-assured Maeve, are exiled from the house where they grew up by their stepmother. The two wealthy siblings are thrown back into the poverty their parents had escaped from and find that all they have to count on is one another. It is this unshakable bond between them that both saves their lives and thwarts their futures.Set over the course of five decades, The Dutch House is a dark fairy tale about two smart people who cannot overcome their past. Despite every outward sign of success, Danny and Maeve are only truly comfortable when they’re together. Throughout their lives, they return to the well-worn story of what they’ve lost with humor and rage. But when at last they’re forced to confront the people who left them behind, the relationship between an indulged brother and his ever-protective sister is finally tested.عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: ‏‫«خانه‌ ی هلندی»؛ «عمارت هلندی»؛ نویسنده: آن پچت؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش روز بیست و سوم ماه سپتامبر سال2019میلادیعنوان: ‏‫خانه‌ ی هلندی؛ نویسنده: آن پچت‮‬‏‫؛ مترجم منا اختیاری؛ تهران، آموت، 1398؛ در 416ص؛ شاب9786003841628؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده 21معنوان: عمارت هلندی؛ نویسنده آن پچت؛ ‏‫مترجم یاسمن ثانوی؛ ویراستار کاوه عزیزی؛ تهران، روزگار، 1399؛ در 352ص؛ شابک9786222330958؛عنوان: عمارت هلندی؛ نویسنده: آن پچت؛ مترجم الهام جمالی‌پویا؛ تهران، کتاب مرو، 1400، در 377ص؛ شابک9786227384178؛عنوان: عمارت هلندی (کوتاه شده)؛ نویسنده آن پچت؛ مترجم نازنین صابری؛ تهران، آسمان نیلگون؛ 1400؛ در 76ص؛ شابک9786227633375؛داستان برادری و خواهری در پنج دهه است؛ «خانه ی هلندی یا عمارت هلندی» ساختمانی‌ در پارک «الکینز، پنسیلوانیا» در حومه ی «فیلادلفیا» است؛ خانواده ی «فن هوبیک»، زن و شوهری با اصالت «هلندی»، که دارایی خود را از صنعت دخانیات، به دست آورده بودند، آن خانه را در سال1922میلادی ساخته اند، ملّاکی خودساخته و پیروز، به نام «سیریل کانروی»، در سال 1946میلادی، آن ساختمان را خرید، تا همسرش «النا» را غافلگیر کند؛ فرزندان آنها، «دنی» و «مِیو» در «خانه ی هلندی» بزرگ شدند؛ «النا»، «خانه ی هلندی» را دوست ندارد، و آنگاه که «دنی» سه ساله و «مِیو» ده ساله است، خانواده‌ اش را رها می‌کند، تا به فقرای «هند» یاری رساند؛ پس از درگذشت «سیریل»، نامادری بچه‌ها «آندره»، «دنی» و «میو» را از خانه بیرون می‌کند، این خواهر و برادر که دیگر کسی را ندارند، باید به همدیگر تکیه نمایند؛ «میو» با باقیمانده ی ارثیه‌ شان، «دنی» را به مدرسه ی شبانه‌ روزی «چوت رزمری ��ال»، دانشگاه «کلمبیا» و دانشکده پزشکی می‌فرستد؛ «دنی»، با اینکه علاقه‌ ای به پزشکی ندارد، برای خوشآیند «میو» دانشکده پزشکی را به پایان می‌رساند؛ راوی این رمان «دنی کانروی» در بزرگسالی‌ خویشتن استتایخ بهنگام رسانی 01/07/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"
42,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2172096-barbara,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5 starsThe lives of siblings Danny and Maeve Conroy are overshadowed by their childhood home, 'The Dutch House', an elegant glass mansion located in Elkins Park - a ritzy suburb of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The house, which looks more like a museum than a residence, was built by the Dutch VanHoebeeks in the 1920s, and purchased - complete with furniture and home décor - by budding real estate mogul Cyril Conroy in 1946. Cyril is delighted to surprise his young family with the house, not knowing it will affect their lives in unpredictable ways. Danny Conroy, who narrates the book as an adult, describes the three-story house as ""a singular confluence of talent and luck that was too much house for anyone"".....but that felt just right to him and Maeve. From certain angles, ""the house seemed to float several inches above the hill it sat on"" and ""the panes of glass that surrounded the glass front door were as big as storefront windows and held in place by wrought iron vines."" The blue Delft mantelpieces in the drawing room, library, and master bedroom were “said to have been pried out of a castle in Utrecht and sold to the VanHoebeeks to pay a prince’s gambling debts.” The house also boasted silk chairs, tapestry ottomans, oil paintings, Chinese lamps, marble floors, gilt ceilings, egg and dart molding, a large ballroom, imposing portraits of Mr. and Mrs. VanHoebeek, a swimming pool, and much more. The first casualty of the Dutch house is Danny and Maeve's mother, Elna, a humble woman who feels compelled to do good works. Elna is profoundly oppressed by the opulent house, and runs off to India to help the poor when Danny is three and Maeve is ten.Since dad Cyril is more involved with his business than his children, Danny and Maeve are largely brought up by housekeeper/cooks Sandy and Jocelyn. The women are conscientious and affectionate caretakers, but they aren't mothers, and Maeve essentially steps into this role for her brother. For her part, Maeve is inconsolable at the loss of her mom, and in addition to general malaise develops diabetes - which the family attributes to Elna's desertion. In time Cyril meets a woman named Andrea, who's mesmerized by the Dutch house. Cyril isn't particularly interested in Andrea, but she slyly inveigles herself into his life, marries him, and moves in with her daughters Norma and Bright. The children - Danny, Maeve, Norma, and Bright - get along like a house afire, but Danny and Maeve never warm up to Andrea.....or she to them. Sadly, as soon as Andrea moves in, she makes it her business to disenfranchise Danny and Maeve.Right after Maeve leaves for Barnard College in New York, for instance, Andrea usurps Maeve's lovely bedroom for Norma and Bright. And when Cyril and Danny plan an excursion to New York to have lunch with Maeve and explore buildings, Andrea invites herself and her girls along AND changes the itinerary to accommodate her own interests. (This doesn't work out so well for Andrea though. 😊)Cyril dies at 53, when 22-year-old Maeve has graduated college and 15-year-old Danny is in high school. Andrea promptly throws Danny out, calling Maeve to come and get him. The angry, hurt siblings set up housekeeping in Maeve's apartment in a nearby town, where Maeve works as an accountant/manager for a frozen vegetable company. Danny and Maeve retrieve very little from the Dutch house, not even family heirlooms or Maeve's portrait, which was commissioned by her father. As it turns out, Danny and Maeve are left with almost nothing. It seems Andrea managed to get EVERYTHING in her name: the Dutch house; Cyril's business; and Cyril's money. (One wonders what Cyril - and his lawyer - were thinking. 😒)Cyril never made a will, and the only thing left specifically for the children (Danny, Maeve, Norma, and Bright) is a trust fund for their education. Danny had planned to join (and eventually inherit) his dad's real estate business, which Andrea promptly sells. So - out of spite - Maeve insists that Danny attend Choate boarding school, then Columbia University, then Columbia Medical School.....all of which are very expensive schools. (FYI: Combined tuition and expenses would cost more than a million dollars in today's money). Andrea is infuriated by Danny draining the education fund, but is helpless to intervene. ChoateColumbiaThough Danny and Maeve no longer have any ownership in the Dutch house, they're inexorably drawn back. The siblings periodically park in front of the house, lambaste Andrea, and reminisce about their lives there.They talk about their mother, their step-sisters Norma and Bright, the housekeepers Sandy and Jocelyn, their bamboozled father, Danny's future, etc. Maeve wants Danny to be a doctor but - though he's training in the medical field - Danny continues to dream of going into real estate. Even in later years, when Danny and Maeve are adults with numerous responsibilities, they occasionally 'visit' the Dutch house.We follow Danny and Maeve for several decades, during which a lot happens: marriage, children, career advancement, new homes, squabbles, chance meetings, re-acquaintances, illness, death.....the usual drama of life. Through it all, Danny and Maeve remain the most important people in each other's lives. No matter what he's doing, Danny always longs to step away and call Maeve; and the only person Maeve loves more than Danny is her departed mother. The story is by no means a tragedy, and no one is out on the street dressed in rags and starving. In fact, from an outside point of view, Danny and Maeve lead very successful lives. The siblings' own dearest wish would probably be to toss Andrea out on her ear....but, as the Rolling Stones sing, ""No, you can't always get what you want; you can't always get what you want; but if you try sometime you find, you get what you need."" The Rolling StonesBy the end of the book, things in Elkins Park come full circle....but in an unexpected way.The book is rather slow-moving for my taste, but I was invested in the story and found the characters memorable, so - for me - the novel was worth reading.

At times, the description of the Dutch House and it’s importance for the characters throughout their lives reminded me of the large old house we grew up in. Our house was known by the name of one of the early owners who became famous, and everyone in our small town referred to it as such. It was a beautiful old home with a ton of character, and one that needed even more work when our family moved in. But, it was the spot for many of our best memories of our childhood, and it’s the only house that I occasionally return to as time goes by. Definitely recommend the audiobook, Tom Hanks was fantastic. Enjoy!"

'The Dutch House' refers to a mansion Meave and Danny live with their parents. We go through the lives of these siblings from their childhood to quite late in their lives. Their mother leaves suddenly without a word one day when they were children, and they never knew why. We go through the next phase of their lives after this event till they are old basically. If you haven't read Ann Patchett before, you need to know that her books are very much character driven, not plot driven. We go through the life span of a family and witness their lives. In this book, the focus was the 2 siblings and their tight relationship. Meave and Danny were a delight to follow. I even envied their unshaken closeness and love for each other as an only child :) They go through a lot together and their support for each other helps them achieve in life. Of course there are lots of other characters, but they are revolving around this brother & sister. I love Patchett's writing. It's very slow, but very immersive. Before you know it, you're drawn to these characters and want to know what's going on in their simple lives. I . was thinking of the book when I wasn't reading it, and wanted to return to it for sure. For people who love slow, character driven stories that goes on for a lifetime, Ann Patchett is the address :) The Waterstones edition with its sprayed edges is a delight!

With each book I fall ever more in love with the elegance of her writing, it’s the kind I melt into, that carries me along the plot line, which seems simple on the surface, meeting characters along the way that I soon come to regard as family with the range of emotions that implies. And even when I don’t particularly like the ending, I accept that it is as it should be.This is a timeless plot with unforgettable characters, but it is the house that looms large in both its physical presence and in the characters’ emotional and often obsessive attachment to it. Ann offers a perfectly paced and intimate portrait of family, loss and longing and will leave you to ponder the essential question posed, do you think it is ever possible to see the past as it actually was?Love doesn’t begin to cover my feelings about this book.

In my world things go wrong, people make mistakes, people struggle to be accepted, to be understood, to be loved, to pay the bills. Bloddy hell, in my world people even struggle to get out of bed each morning. The thing is, I come from a very big family and life has been hard for most of the time for all of us. Isolation, uneducated and exploited children, too many pregnancies, teenage pregnancies, disabilities, bullying, hunger, financial problems, cancer, depression, drug abuse, Alzheimer’s, suicide (and more). There was always a “story” about one of these topics in my life (sometimes more than one at the same time. Can you believe it?). We, as a family, have seen all of this. We know of these things not simply because we’ve heard about them but because we’ve been there. We know how it feels. Oh, yes, life is hard. Sometimes unbearably hard. And this is why I didn’t believe any of this. Well, to be clear and fair, I didn’t believe in a single world Ann Patchett has written down here. I believe Mrs Patchett simply didn’t know. She heard it all in the news. It’s not her fault that she has been lucky. Luck plays a big role in this game called life, you know…Mrs Patchett might have done some research on real estate and law but for me that didn’t make for a more believable storyline anyway. She’d put her characters in a certain difficult situation and then, because she didn’t really know how things happen in the real world, she jumps forwards in time and (abracadabra) everything’s sorted. Then she jumps in time again, this time backwards and tells us about another difficult situation in the characters lives but only to jump forward again in time and (abracadabra) we’ll find everything is sorted again. When she wasn’t solving things jumping in time, she would add an unbelievable coincidence or create a convenient new character and easily sort things out (again). Clever, hum?! While reading this book, I actually never knew how things played out, I just learned that they did. When Mrs Patchett finally stopped using this annoying literary device its was already too late and I didn’t really give a damn about what happened or not to all these people. Later on, Mrs Patchett went back to her favourite way of sorting things out and she managed to annoy me even more by telling me “two weeks later” that she killed one of the main characters. Ahahah. If all this had happened to real human beings they would have pulled out all the hair from their own heads. They would have screamed and shouted. They would have cried for mercy. It’s human nature. And this takes us to what was missing here and what I wanted to see, what I think was needed to tell a story like this; Humanity. Three stars only because this was a quick and easy read and the writing wasn’t that bad. This was my introduction to Ann Patchett’s writing and I’ve had enough of her already. She definitely adds too much sugar for my taste. No more for me, thank you very much."

Paintings of the Dutch couple, Mr. and Mrs. VanHoebeek (“Van-who-bake”), dominate the drawing room and a portrait of Maeve, at ten in her bright red coat, hangs on the opposite wall. That’s the cover of the book, which is great.The story is told in a circular fashion. It opens with their father bringing home a woman, Andrea, to meet his children. Their mother had left, returned, left, returned, and finally left for good. The two servants, Sandy and Jocelyn, have been raising the children, who are comfortable with things the way they are. Maeve is fifteen, Danny, eight. Andrea is obviously smitten with the grand house but seems less enthusiastic about Cyril’s children. Maeve is already a head taller than the tiny widow, and later, when they discover Andrea has two little girls, there is even less likelihood she will view them favourably.”Though the story will be remembered that Maeve and Andrea were at odds right from the start, that wasn’t true. Maeve was perfectly fair and polite when they met, and she remained fair and polite until doing so was no longer possible.”Cyril has become a successful property developer and Danny loves going with him to inspect buildings and building sites and collect the rents from tenants. He looks forward to taking over the company one day. He’s learning how to fix taps, patch cracks, work with his hands.“’The only way to really understand what money means is to have been poor,’ he said to me when we were eating lunch in the car. ‘That’s the strike you have against you. A boy grows up rich like you, never wanting for anything, never being hungry’—he shook his head, as if it had been a disappointing choice I’d made—'I don’t know how a person overcomes a thing like that.’”He loves his dad, but it’s Maeve who is the gravitational force around which he orbits. They are fiercely loyal to each other, an unbreakable unit against the world. Maeve manages his life.I found Danny completely self-absorbed, worrying mostly about himself and Maeve, but taking little real interest in anyone else. He loves playing basketball with friends, but they aren’t part of the story. It’s interesting to read about children growing up in post-war Pennsylvania and how a war veteran like their father managed to establish himself. It is not interesting to have scene after scene after scene of Maeve and Danny talking about the house and picking at the scabs on the wounds caused by Andrea, and before that, their mother’s disappearance. It’s all about Danny, and I wasn’t that crazy about him. I understand the popular audio book is narrated by Tom Hanks. The voice in my head was a bit petulant sometimes, more like Steve Carell's character from the American version of The Office, when Maeve was talking Danny into something. [I must admit, I haven't heard the Hanks rendition, and he's such a good actor, I know he can complain as well as anyone. But he's better known for being likeable and smart.]I lost interest as time went on. I found the strength of Maeve’s influence a bit much to swallow. I don’t want to give any spoilers, so I’ll just say that the alliances that formed later and the resolution of some of the relationships seemed to tie up the loose ends too neatly and unrealistically, for me. But don’t take my word for it. This is a very popular book, and you may love it as so many others have. I enjoyed it enough to round up to four stars rather than down to three.Thanks to NetGalley and Bloomsbury for the preview copy from which I’ve quoted."
51,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25472453-christy,Rating 3 out of 5,"Tom Hanks as narrator... YES PLEASE!! I will listen to anything he reads -- I just love him so much! I feel like the main character in this book is literally the house -- The Dutch House. Cyril Conroy builds an extremely successful real estate business, literally a rags to riches story. His children are Maeve and Danny. Danny is the narrator of the family story. Cyril buys the house as a gift for his wife, Elna, who ends up hating everything it stands for. She later abandons her family when the children are still very young. She can't stand the house, living in it, or being waited on while there are poor people all over the world that need help. When their father later dies, the children are kicked out of the house by their horrible step mother, Andrea. They are forced to rely on one another, and I loved hearing about how deep their sibling bond was for life. The house is literally the downfall for every character in the story at some point, and neither sibling can let it go and move on. They are always coming back to it, even if it is just to set outside of it and reminisce. Unpopular opinion: I didn't love this one like I expected. I typically love family stories that span many decades, but this one fell flat for me. However, it was definitely beautifully written and started off strong. I was super into the beginning, and then I felt myself just wanting it to be over. Much of it seemed so unrealistic and I just got very bored."

53,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25667717-doug,Rating 5 out of 5,"A HUGE thanx to Netgalley and HarperCollins for a review copy of this book, in exchange for this honest review. I've only read two other Patchett books, but she has already become a favorite author, and I was very excited to be granted this ARC months prior to its publication in late Sept., since her last novel, Commonwealth, made it into my top 5 reads for 2016 - and I am fairly confident this one will do likewise for 2019.The storyline follows somewhat similar ground as that previous book, being, more or less, an intricate family saga covering decades of the ins and outs of the Conroy family, and in particular, how the titular family manse outside Philadelphia impacts and impedes various relationships. The focus is primarily on a pair of siblings, with younger brother Danny doing the narrating, and once again Patchett does not follow a linear chronology, but weaves the stories back and forwards from the late 40's to the early 2000's. I sometimes had trouble following this in her previous book, since there was a plethora of characters to keep straight, but this is an easier go, since there are really only about a dozen characters in total. Although Patchett's prose is not fussy or overtly calls attention to itself, it always flows beautifully and is a pleasure to luxuriate in. Just the kind of lovely, leisurely read one wants/needs for the beginning of summer. I hope it is a tremendous success for her."

This is an intelligent novel that is almost a fable including an evil stepmonster but it’s the house that looms large. A house that represents success, greed, loss, sadness and, ultimately, forgiveness. A wife is desperately unhappy, close siblings are eventually ousted and many lives are deeply affected by the house and what it means to each character. Patchett has a deft touch and now I’ll have the pleasure of reading her other work."
55,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59050228-meike,Rating 4 out of 5,"Now Nominated for the Women's Prize for Fiction 2020This family saga is compulsively readable and highly accessible, but not without depth: While the story is narrated from the point of view of Danny Conroy, the main protagonist is his sister Maeve who, after their father dies and their stepmother throws them out of the house, raises and takes care of her little brother. The title-giving Dutch House is the Conroy's former family home and becomes an obsession for the siblings who associate it with their lost childhood, a manifestation of their enigmatic past. Throughout their lives, the mansion exerts a gravitational pull, both as an idea and as a physical place: Danny and Maeve visit the house, but do not enter it, as their stepmother continues to live there. Patchett follows the Conroy siblings over decades, and the story is pushed forward by the riddles of their family history: What happened to their biological mother after she left the family? What happened to the nanny and the rest of the staff working for the family, what became of their stepsisters? What will become of Danny and Maeve who are now by themselves? Two narrative devices are particularly striking: The author remixes classic fairy tales (the siblings searching for their way home (Danny's wife even mentions ""Hänsel und Gretel""), the evil stepmother etc.) and works with the motif of the double. Characters often form pairs, most obviously the Conroy siblings themselves, and when a third party enters the picture, it gets complicated. Loyalty and selflessness are main topics of the book. The book is most interesting when Patchett hints at the subjective feelings of guilt and anger and at the flaws of the characters: Danny is a victim of the circumstanes, but frequently oblivious to the plight of those who try to help him; Maeve is struggling to find a balance between living her own life and protecting her brother; and many other characters are also torn between conflicting feelings and interests (I don't want to spoil the plot points that keep readers invested in the story). While the language is not particularly inventive or lyrical, it is still addictive and manages to create an absorbing atmosphere. Also, there are some aspects of the story that don't quite ring true and/or have an soap opera-like quality, but the story is so intriguing that it doesn't matter all that much. Patchett plants many ideas and develops them throughout the story (the meaning of a house as a home, illness and trauma, portraits as a means to reveal and capture people, the role of religion/Catholicism, the toxicity of unresolved conflicts, forms of love and selflessness), but the text is very easy to follow and reads quickly. So all in all, maybe not the biggest literary masterpiece ever written, but this book is very intelligent entertainment and fun to read.

57,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,Rating 5 out of 5,"An Ann Patchett novel is a treasure. She writes about family so compellingly that I always feel as if I know her characters in real life, and I'm drawn into the stories she shares about their inner lives.If you're already a Patchett fan, you've probably heard about how she describes her novels: ""I've been writing the same book my whole life -- that you're in one family, and all of a sudden, you're in another family and it's not your choice and you can't get out.""The Dutch House is a novel about family, but this time the focus is on two siblings, Maeve and Danny. Maeve is our heroine, but her younger brother Danny is our narrator. We see how their lives get upended when their mother runs away and their father picks a wicked stepmother as his second wife.I listened to this book on audio, performed by Tom Hanks, who was a marvelous storyteller. I usually read an Ann Patchett novel several times, and I'm already looking forward to re-reading this one and discovering anew all of her clever descriptions. Highly recommended for readers who like literary fiction.Favorite PassageFor the most part, what I knew about my father was what I saw: he was tall and thin with weathered skin and hair the color of rust, the color of my hair. All three of us had blue eyes. His left knee was slow to bend, worse in the winter and when it rained. He never said a word about it but it was easy enough to tell when it hurt him. He smoked Pall Malls, put milk in his coffee, worked the crossword puzzle before reading the front page. He loved buildings the way boys loved dogs. When I was eight years old, I asked my father at the dinner table if he was going to vote for Eisenhower or Stevenson. Eisenhower was running for a second term and all the boys in school were for him. My father clicked the point of his knife against his plate and told me I was never to ask a question like that, not of him, not of anyone. ""It may be fine for boys to speculate on whom they might vote for because boys can't vote,"" he said. ""But to ask an adult such a question is to violate a man's right to privacy."" In retrospect, I imagine my father was horrified that I might think there was any chance he'd vote for Stevenson, but I didn't know that at the time. What I knew was that you had to touch a hot stove only once. Here are the things I talked to my father about when I was a boy: baseball -- he liked the Phillies. Trees -- he knew the name of every one, though he would chastise me for asking about the same kind of tree more than once. Birds -- likewise. He kept feeders in the backyard and could easily identify all of his customers. Buildings -- be it their structural soundness, architectural details, property value, property tax, you name it -- my father liked to talk about buildings. To list the things I didn't ask my father about would be to list the stars in heaven, so let me throw out one: I did not ask my father about women. Not women in general and what you were supposed to do with them, and definitely not women in the particular: my mother, my sister, Andrea."
58,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6677659-marchpane,Rating 4 out of 5,"“It’s like you’re Hansel and Gretel. You just keep walking through the dark woods holding hands no matter how old you get. Do you ever get tired of reminiscing?”For those who’ve read Ann Patchett before, The Dutch House probably needs no introduction. It’s Ann Patchett. It’s a family saga. That’s all you need.For those (like me) who haven’t, it’s a little harder to explain the book’s appeal. It spans decades, following a brother and sister, Danny & Maeve Conroy. They live in a fancy house, then they don’t. The house is THE most remarkable thing about them. It haunts their lives.But it’s the way Patchett tells it that makes it special, the layers, the tapestry of details. We learn about the VanHoebeeks, who owned the Dutch House before the Conroys. When the VanHoebeek family line ended, the house was sold with all its contents, right down to the jewels, and two eerie life-sized paintings of the former occupants. It’s the depth of characterisations, where no one is wholly good or bad, the humanity contained in their flaws and foibles. It’s the fairytale allusions, the way Patchett replaces gingerbread and candy with floor-to-ceiling glass and blue delft mantels, and loses none of the magic and awe.This is a sparkling world of privilege, even after the house is lost, but Patchett avoids writing a ‘rich people problems’ book in two ways:1)	The problems faced are universal. A sudden death or betrayal or abandonment; an unexpected reversal of fortunes; long-simmering resentments and paths to forgiveness. Nothing money could solve. 2)	Chance is a major factor, as much in raising fortunes as losing them. Or call it luck, or fate, these lives are sailing on its winds.It’s an utterly charming, moving, absorbing novel, only slightly let down by some draggy bits and the fact that I deeply, deeply disliked the ending. But I’m definitely a Patchett fan now. 4 stars."
59,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11701608-barbara-catching-up,Rating 5 out of 5,"Full confession: I love Ann Patchett’s writing. I KNOW I’m getting a solid novel that will cut into me, make me think, build compassion, see understanding. In her new novel “The Dutch House” she explores, again, children who are left without parental interest and supervision. As with “Commonwealth”, she also explores blended families and the bonds of stepsiblings. Beyond her themes, her writing is beautiful, lyrical, easy, like floating on an inter-tube on a lazy sunny day.Can you come to peace with what happened to you in childhood is a major theme? Danny is three when his mother leaves him and his sister Maeve, who is ten at the time. They live in a house that they call “The Dutch House” which is this big striking mansion that is ornate and ostentatious. Danny’s father bought it as a gift for Danny’s mother without her knowing. His parents were poor Irish immigrants and unbeknownst to his mother, his father, Cyril makes money in real estate without ever consulting or explaining their change in status to Elna, Danny’s mother. The family moves into the Dutch House when Maeve is five. The house even comes with a housekeeper, it’s too much for Elna who loves being poor.To add complexity, Cyril is an absent father and the children are basically raised by house staff. Along come an evil woman who has designs on the house and Cyril. Of course, Cyril marries her, and she brings in two girls. As with Patchett’s other stories, the children blend well. It’s the evil stepmother who adds tragedy when Cyril unexpectedly dies, and she bans Maeve and Danny from the house. Not only that, but she leaves the two penniless except for an educational trust left for Danny. By then Maeve is through college and Danny is a high schooler.Danny feels anger at his mother for abandoning them. Maeve feels longing. Their grit and determination get them through life. The story is told through Danny’s eyes and the story is non-linear, much like our thoughts.This would be a fabulous book club read. All the characters in the novel are fodder for discussion. Patchett shows how humans find their way, find their strengths and bonds. She shows through her characters how some can find forgiveness, some compassion, and always gratitude. "
60,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/630381-susan-liston,Rating 1 out of 5,"Okay, here comes the mean old crab again, unmoved by all the five star reviews. I did hesitate with one star, because it's not a bad book, Ann Patchett is a perfectly good writer, but I did not like this and my ratings are personal. (I've read three of her other books, hated one (Bel Canto) and felt lukewarm about the others.) I thought this had promise at the start. But soon it began to drag, and I began to really dislike our narrator, Danny. I didn't even believe the characters of the mother and evil stepmother. The only likable person was Maeve, and yes, she was good and dependable and kind, etc., everyone should be so lucky to have a Maeve, but how interesting to read about? For me, not very. If you are going to read a novel with pretty much no plot, you better enjoy the heck out of the characters because that's all you're going to get. And I didn't. But, hey, great cover."
61,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37596075-holly,Rating 5 out of 5,"Ann Patchett is a master storyteller and she lives up to this reputation with her latest work - The Dutch House. Her writing is superb and the stories she tells invite you in and before you know it, you’ve developed deep relationships with the characters. This is a story about abandonment, love, family, loyalty, loss, and forgiveness. It is also about growing up and letting go of the past.There are three main characters - Danny, the narrator and younger brother of Maeve, our second character and the House. The Dutch House was first built by the VanHoebeeks, who decorated it in Dutch style and lived there until they died. In fact, all of their possessions had remained there after they had left this world. Life-sized portraits of Mr. and Mrs. VanHoebeeks adorned the walls of the drawing room and paintings of other relatives hung on walls throughout the house. It was a grand estate with glass in the front that saw all the way through to the flowers in the back. Patchett skillfully gives the House life with vivid imagery and detailed descriptions that you will almost feel like you are there.The VanHoebeeks weren’t the story, but in a sense the house was the story, and it was their house.The Dutch House, as it came to be known in Elkins Park and Jenkintown and Glenside and all the way to Philadelphia, referred not to the house’s architecture but to its inhabitants. The Dutch House was the place where those Dutch people with the unpronounceable name lived.When they were young, Danny and Maeve’s mother abandoned them and Maeve stepped into that role. Danny expressed concern that no one could do the same for Maeve. The two siblings grew incredibly close and stayed that way throughout their lives. Their relationship was very touching and a very appealing aspect of the story. Several years after their Mother left, their Father married Andrea, who was the epitome of the evil stepmother. Their dislike of her further united them, if that was even possible.We ate the cookies and dredged up every awful memory of Andrea we had. We traded them between us like baseball cards, exclaiming over every piece of information one of us didn’t already know. We dug a pit and roasted her.The Dutch House figures prominently in the story. It drove Maeve’s and Danny’s Mother away — it symbolized to her luxurious excess in a world where others went starving. For their Father, it represented success. The house is what ultimately brought Andrea into their family — she married their Father in order to get it.For Danny and Maeve, the house was a place to grow up as well as to return. It represented their memories and their pasts. A dominant theme in The Dutch House is the siblings’ inability to let go of the past and their emotional baggage of anger as well as regret. The house physically drew them back time and time again, like a magnet. Whenever Danny returned to town, he and Maeve would end up parked across the street from the Dutch House, watching for any activity or news. There was no extra time in those days and I didn’t want to spend the little of it I had sitting in front of the goddamn house, but that’s where we wound up......like swallows, like salmon, we were the helpless captives of our migratory patterns.Looking and watching the house, they would reminisce about the past and wonder if one can ever truly contemplate the past objectively.But we overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.I didn’t even know they were sisters, meaning I was a toad. But that’s me layering the present onto the past.Ann Patchett weaves together emotional stories, which capture your heart. She is a fabulous writer: here are a few examples of her masterful use of imagery and metaphors/similes.Whatever romantic notions I might have harbored, whatever excuses or allowances my heart had ever made on her behalf, blew out like a match.There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you’d been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet in place, and for a moment you’re suspended, knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself.That was it. Fluffy, who had not stopped talking since I walked in the door, shut down like a mechanical horse in need of another nickel."
62,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23381142-natalie,Rating 4 out of 5,"If you needed any convincing to read this book, take this next passage as your sign:(it’s a bit long but so worth the read)“Mothers were the measure of safety, which meant that I was safer than Maeve. After our mother left, Maeve took up the job on my behalf but no one did the same for her. Of course Sandy and Jocelyn mothered us. They made sure we were washed and fed and that our lunches were packed and our scouting dues paid. They loved us, I know they did, but they went home at the end of the day. There was no crawling into bed with Sandy or Jocelyn when I had a bad dream in the middle of the night, and it never once occurred to me to knock on my father’s door. I went to Maeve. She taught me the proper way to hold a fork. She attended my basketball games and knew all my friends and oversaw my homework and kissed me every morning before we went our separate ways to school and again at night before I went to bed regardless of whether or not I wanted to be kissed. She told me repeatedly, relentlessly, that I was kind and smart and fast, that I could be as great a man as I made up my mind to be. She was so good at all that, despite the fact that no one had done it for her.”This rings so true.The feelings evoked in me while reading The Dutch House were reminiscent of my reading experience with books like The Great Alone, Little Fires Everywhere, and A Spool of Blue Thread (both even have the similar ""Oh, Danny""). That is to say, what a journey awaits me. Maeve will be someone to behold.“Five whole days with you at home,” she said, blowing smoke out the open window. “The best five days of the year.”On another note, it showcases the author’s talents that within one page I can hate a character and yet know nothing substantial about them. Ahem, Andrea. You can just tell, like with real people, who spells trouble. Translating that feeling on paper? That’s a magical writer right there.But back to reasons why I love Maeve: “Maeve was pretty enough and popular enough that she would never have had to stay home on Saturday nights, but for the most part she did, and for the first time I realized it was because of me. She would never have left me alone in the house.”Big sisters. That's it. “and the way the last bit of light fell over her, she looked like a painting.”She looked like a … painting!! She has long black hair! The painting of the girl on the cover is MAEVE. I knew it held something more about it. 

I couldn’t stop staring at the cover when I first got my hands on the book. And so I kept feeling drawn like a magnet to it until I finally caved in and picked the book up. Like, it wouldn’t leave my head until I had it in my hands. This book was calling to me. Or rather, Maeve was calling to me. I'm intrigued now.“Now that she wasn’t around to help me with my homework, I wondered for the first time who had ever helped her when she was young.”I never realized just how much my soul needed to read a book about appreciating older sisters as stand-in mothers until I stumbled upon The Dutch House. This is healing. It’s the little things no one notices when it comes to taking care of younger siblings, like helping them out with their homework, or those simple moments that arise to remind them of how good they are so those values are instilled from a young age.“You only think you want to get rid of your sister,” Jocelyn said, clapping her hand on my shoulder in a firm manner so as not to embarrass me. “Then when she’s gone it turns out you miss her.”I wonder if this feeling has a name. It evokes the most acute emotion.Not only does this book represent the part of an older sister fully committed to her younger sibling, it's the loss of a childhood home that cannot go unnoticed. It reverberates throughout your life. The hurt these next passages encompass cannot be overstated:“The idiocy of what we took and what we left cannot be overstated. We packed up clothes and shoes I would outgrow in six months, and left behind the blanket at the foot of my bed my mother had pieced together out of her dresses.”“and there were some other things—yearbooks, a couple boxes of novels she’d already read, some dolls she was saving for the daughter she was sure she would have one day, all in the attic under the eaves and behind the tiny door in the back of the third-floor bedroom closet. Did Andrea even know about that space? Maeve had shown it to the girls the night of the house tour, but would they remember or ever think to look in there again? Or would those boxes just belong to the house now, sealed into the wall like a time capsule from her youth?”You'll forever think about the things you didn't think to take. “I always imagined the house would die without us. I don’t know, I thought it would crumple up. Do houses ever die of grief?” The longwinded realization that at the end of the day a house is just that, a house, came to me after years and years. The house stays the same for the most part. You’re the one who changes through the years.What a powerful story. Like I said earlier, The Dutch House reminds me distinctly of The Great Alone. It's that sense of togetherness and loyalty you feel as the reader to these book characters. Maeve was the star of this book for me. The quiet star that shines the brightest but is set aside too often. She never got quite what she deserved. She worked the hardest of them all and was never fully redeemed, especially with a character like Celeste to remind her of that. And who is Celeste to say those things? Her name says all you need to know about her character.Celeste wasn’t listening. Where Maeve was concerned she didn’t listen. “At what point do you say to her, Okay, it was an awful childhood, it’s a terrible thing to be rich and then not be rich, but now everybody has to grow up?”People like her are why people like Andrea exist.Celeste never fully understands the sacrifice Maeve had to make to ensure Danny’s well being. Celeste never thinks about why Maeve took on that job she thinks is beneath her (to stay closer to Danny) or why she lives where she does (to stay closer to Danny). Maeve served everyone but herself, and it upsets me to think someone so privileged - so entitled to their privilege they aren't even aware of it- has the audacity to judge Maeve. It reminded me of this brilliant line in the poem, ""To this day"": When a kid who could still go home to mom and dadHad the audacity to tell him “get over it”Though my hatred wasn't Andrea-level, it felt pretty close. This passage hits it right on:“Those are my two choices? I love her or I hate her?”“Well,” my sister said, “you’re telling me you didn’t hate her, so I just want to know what the parameters are. I think it’s a ridiculous conversation to be having in the first place, if you want my opinion. Say there’s a kid who lives next door, a kid you have no particular friendship with but no problems with either. Then one day he walks into your house and kills your sister with a baseball bat.”“Maeve, for the love of God.”She held up her hand. “Hear me out. Does that present fact obliterate the past? Maybe not if you loved the kid. Maybe if you loved the kid you’d dig in and try to find out what had happened, see things from his perspective, wonder what his parents had done to him, wonder if there wasn’t some chemical imbalance. You might even consider that your sister could have played a role in the outcome—did she torment this boy? Was she cruel to him? But you’d only wonder about that if you loved him. If you only liked the kid, if he was never anything more to you than an okay neighbor, I don’t see the point in scratching around for good memories. He’s gone to prison. You’re never going to see the son-of-a-bitch again.”I love her.If anything, Danny’s lackluster relationship and medical education were worth for this one scene:“Do my spine,” she said.She hadn’t taken her shower yet and she still smelled like the ocean, like the wind coming over Brighton Beach. I reached my fingers beneath her hair and felt the base of her skull. “Atlas, axis, first cervical vertebra.” I pressed each one like a piano key, touch and then release, counting all seven. “Thoracic. You’ve got to do a better job with the sunscreen.”“Hush. Don’t ruin it.”“Thoracic.” I counted out the twelve, and then I got to the lumbar. I rubbed deep circles in her lower back until she made soft, cowlike sounds.”I'm so attached to Maeve that seeing her receive the bare minimum was beyond painful to read. Give her a break! Not only did Maeve have to deal with someone like Andrea in her youth, on top of taking care of her younger sibling, she now receives someone like Celeste in her adulthood to battle with. Needless to say she did not receive the ending I thought she deserved. This book is depressing, too much like reality. I'm already hurt in real life. Give me at least some semblance of a happy ending for characters that deserve it the most in books. This, too, reminds me of my experience with The Great Alone.Join me and read the opening chapter for yourself. You’ll be hooked.

Can hardly think of the last time a historical fiction including so many mundanities of everyday life entranced me so fully. And this isn't a story I've read before. In one sense it carves out a place in the annals of true Americana, exploring the dichotomy of greed and abnegation across generations. In another it's a sweet, small family drama exploring the bond between two siblings. Patchett paints characters that are as full and recognizable as the inimitable Anne Tyler's, if not necessarily as charming, for better or worse. I have a very short list of must-read-every-new-book authors, and after my first Patchett, she has tentatively made the list.Posted in Mr. Philip's Library"

Many parts of it lived up to my expectations, but there were too many pages that seemed to drag along without advancing either the story line or the character development. I also found it difficult to stay emotionally involved with characters whose decisions keep making their situation worse for themselves with no good reason or perceived benefit. Finally, the ending seemed tacked on rather than flowing from the story. The writing, as always with Ann Patchett, was often beautiful and occasionally stunning."
65,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2967061-anne,Rating 2 out of 5,"I always look forward to a new Ann Patchett novel, having enjoyed all the ones I've read so far. I listened to this one on audio, narrated wonderfully by Tom Hanks. While listening and enjoying the narration I kept wondering where this story was going. I also had questions about choices made and agreed upon by the main characters and about the stereotypical evil step mother, but knew that I was in the hands of a great storyteller and trusted that Patchett was just taking her time setting up the story for a terrific denouement . But by Part 3, which took up the last 2/3rds of the novel, I saw that I was mistaken. This part didn't explain what I needed explained (can't say more without spoilers) which was really frustrating, and took the story in a direction that I couldn't buy. It just didn't make any emotional or psychological sense and was very underwhelming as an ending. In fact, I was taken by surprise when the book ended. I was still looking for something more, something deeper, more meaningful. I kept feeling ""What? That's it? "" There had to be a more satisfying conclusion to everything that happened in the first 2/3rds of the novel. But there wasn't. I felt the need of a book group to discuss this novel and to vent my frustrations. While listening to the book I thought that this was going to be a 3 star read for me (or 4 stars if Patchett pulled the story together in a satisfying way). Given the ending, it was a 2 star read with 1 star added for the Tom Hanks narration. I see from most of the current GR reviews that I'm in the minority on this one. That makes me pause to wonder why I had such a different experience. Again, I feel the need for that book group.On a different note, I greatly enjoyed the several references to the Hungarian Pastry Shop near Columbia University in NYC. I went there often when I was a student and worked and lived in that area. That brought back memories."

I'm not sure why, but I was worried that I might find it harder to connect with a new story in audio form. Luckily it only took me a few chapters to adjust, aided by my returning the reading speed to normal, as Tom Hanks reads much faster than Stephen Fry.I loved listening to this and got completely caught up in it. I found the characters fixation on The Dutch House more relatable than I had expected. Maeve was a wonderful, occasionally frustrating character. Her brother was less dynamic and I'm actually not sure I would have liked him that much but his love for his sister, his appreciation of her and his dedication to her did endear him to me.I found the situation of them losing their father and being banished from the house by their stepmother understandably difficult, and sympathised to a point with Maeve's desire to bleed the education trust dry. It was amusing at times and part of me got the point, but it also felt so self-indulgent, petty, wasteful. They were put in a tough spot, her more than him, but why not use that free education to build toward something rather than just prove a point? If they were real people I would have little time for them I think, but as characters they were fascinating.I might like to read this one again one day as there was something quite beautiful about it. It was a gripping story, and I enjoyed it, even when I was feeling deeply frustrated with the two siblings and the decisions they made.I love the cover, its what made me want to read the book. I don't always appreciate a fictional book having such a specific image of the main character as I prefer to imagine them for myself, but this one is so perfect that I don't mind. It's another reason why I want a physical copy, so I can see the image in full, and take it off the shelf to look at whenever I want to."

It felt dark and depressing through most of the book and described such a sad family life for two children to live through, I felt like I had a dark cloud over my head every time I sat down to read it.With so many readers touting how great it was, I felt a bit bewildered as to why I didn't feel the love here...!? What was I missing? I did like the way the book ended and was glad for that but to have to travel the entire book to get to this one favorable destination I liked? Hmmm...? I'm told the Audiobook is much better so I plan to listen to that version sometime in my next lifetime. Perhaps Tom Hank's voice will have an influence on my rating.

69,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/79324789-nzlisam,Rating 5 out of 5,"Haunting, innovative and poignant, The Dutch House demonstrates compassion and understanding.Sister and brother, Maeve and Danny Conroy grew up in The Dutch House.Their mother left when they were small, sneaking away from The Dutch House in the middle of the night.A few years later, their father brings Andrea (their future stepmother), along with her two young daughters to live in The Dutch House.When their father dies, their evil stepmother banishes them from The Dutch House, to fend for themselves, alone and penniless. But, no matter how far they travel, or how many years pass, Maeve and Danny just can’t let go of The Dutch House.An epic generational saga of family dysfunction, neglect, abandonment, stolen inheritance, and a troubled relationship between siblings. Maeve and Danny’s impenetrable unbreakable bond was warm, supportive, and loving in some respects, and I was sympathetic to their plight. However, it was also unhealthy and destructive, capable of sabotaging and undermining any other relationship they had, or formed, and tended to be controlling, co-dependent, and demanding. Furthermore, their inability to come to terms with their past invaded every facet of their lives and affected every decision. The story was influenced by both fairy tale and folklore. There were references or similarities to Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, Hansel and Gretel, Snow White, and the Nutcracker ballet, among others. The Dutch House – named after the nationality of its original owner’s the VanHoebeeks (whose portraits were on prominent display above the fireplace) – was a character in itself and took on a eerie, ever-present life of its own. The three-storey mansion, built in the 1920’s, was grand, imposing, sprawling, and contained a cellar, attic, multiple bedrooms, and even a ballroom, and let’s face it, you can’t get more fairy tale than that? Danny always referred to it by its title, never just house or home.Our sole POV was a middle-aged Danny (first person) reflecting back on his childhood and early adult years and how they shaped the man he became in his late forties/early fifties. The story opened in 1956 when Danny was eight (Maeve fifteen) with the arrival of Andrea into their lives, stepping across the threshold of The Dutch House for the first time. Events encompass the next fifty years, somewhat chronologically, but also contained flashbacks and flash forwards smack bang in the middle of any given chapter. Meaning, there were one or two occasions where I had to remind myself what stage of life Danny was narrating from. But, Ann Patchett, did include little reminders which got me back on track, so all good. The book art, the painting of 12-year-old Maeve in her Red Riding Hood coat is probably my favourite cover of all time. I just can’t stop staring at it! Mesmerising!The Dutch House was a sensational novel that entertained, informed and amused. Deserves pride of place on your bookshelf."

I missed a few of hers pre-Bel Canto and while I haven't yet gotten to them, it comforts me to know that they're waiting for me for when life slows down (I've heard that happens; one day you wake up and you're older and retired and you can read all the time). When I heard The Dutch House was coming out and saw its distinctive cover (Who IS that girl? I wondered) I put it on my TBDWIR (To Be Devoured When It Releases) list pronto.And then it released and people were talking about it, and it was popping up on bestsellers lists all over the place and audio book lovers were swooning over this tale being read to them by the venerable Tom Hanks. I hurried through the other required reading I was working on, and made space in my life to enjoy The Dutch House. I had already bought it, it was just there on my cluttered nightstand awaiting me.I hadn't read much about the novel, which is my usual thing. I don't read the back copy of books I know I am going to want to read. Sometimes there are mini spoilers there. So I didn't know what The Dutch House was or who lived in it or what it meant to them. I didn't know what the evocative painting on the front meant and I certainly couldn't know how I would be affected when Patchett revealed the significance of that painting, and this at a time in the story when I had already fallen in love with these perfectly drawn characters. It was the kind of book that I couldn't wait to get back to, not because I just had to know what happened next, but because I just had to know what happened to these characters next.  Here is just one of the beautifully composed thoughts penned in its pages.“There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you'd been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet in place, and for a moment you're suspended knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself.”I was going to use the back cover copy to tell you what the book is about but I'm not going to. I will just say it's a book about a brother and sister, and their childhood home, and everything that the word ""home"" might and should conjure up in your mind when you hear that word spoken.  I loved it so much I am going to use one of my Audible credits and have Tom Hanks read it to me. I hardly ever read books twice because, you know, so many books, so little time. So you know it's a good one when I tell you I'll be ""reading"" this one again. Soon.Highly recommend."
71,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3642045-sue,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Dutch House is the story of a family, and a very distinguished house, and the ways in which that combination played on everyone’s lives and relationships. It is also a story of the ways in which a person’s life can be altered, hemmed in, defined, expanded, most definitely changed, for good or ill, by significant others and even a place. Also a story of fighting, or not fighting, those influences to live one’s own life.And a wonderful story it is. Ann Patchett is an excellent writer, able to capture her characters and settings so well. Some we learn about quickly; others develop or evolve more slowly. The Dutch House is itself a character in this novel as its presence is a factor in much of the major activity throughout. It is an old mansion purchased by Mr Conroy as surprise for his wife who had no idea he had somehow become rich.In the beginning, there were Maeve and Danny Conroy, children of Cyril and Elna Conroy. Elna has been gone from their lives since Danny was a toddler, leaving him with no memory of her. Maeve, being older, has fond, loving memories. Family rumor is Elna apparently left for India years before. Father seems a somewhat standoff type man, showing occasional moments of warm emotion. True warmth comes from support staff needed to care for the house and children, Sandy and Jocelyn, who provide motherly care. Danny narrates the novel.Beyond that well...then it is how life develops. I do not want to walk you through the ups and downs and sometimes odd decisions made during the years as Danny and Maeve mature and make life choices. That’s for you to read. And I do recommend you read this book. It’s a primer on the directions and misdirections life can take as people try to deal with the remnants of their childhood. It’s also a very vivid portrayal of the relationship of a brother and sister from the teen years into adulthood, as their lives change.4.5* - 5* A copy of this book was provided by the publisher through NetGalley in return for an honest review."

It's familial. The best way I can express it is to say that if The Dutch House and my first novel (Plan Z by Leslie Kove) and my mother's first novel (The Trouble with the Truth) were sisters, The Dutch House would be our middle sibling. This book makes me miss my long-dead mother because I feel as if she should know about it. And I should be able to talk with her about the fact that I read it just after learning that the new new-owners demolished the house my mother built, which always seemed to me like a live being with roots deep in my psyche, even long after we gave it up in 1968. Even though I and my siblings had terrible memories of our life there, during the 48 years that the people we sold it to lived there, we each individually made pilgrimages to visit or just look at the house. And it just seems unfair that now my mother and I cannot mourn the demise of her creation while reading and admiring The Dutch House—while as writers, we marvel at everything from the gorgeous cover art by painter Noah Saterstrom (what a daring artist) to the story about a family and a house, which is so reminiscent yet completely different from both of our work that I have a very hard time believing we are not all related. I wish we were. "
73,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7862560-la-cantrell,Rating 5 out of 5,"Ann Patchett is the man! And of course, I mean that in more ways than this flippant complimentary term carries. That Tom Hanks, of all people, was the one to narrate this audiobook might just be a testament to how great it is.My first confession, though, is that she is probably my favorite writer ever. I own and have read every novel she's penned, not because of the high drama (although there is always some of that) or the quirky family situations (a ubiquitous inclusion) and the thread of lies (again, a constant) in all of them. Patchett has a quiet grace and slicing analysis that are rarely found in the writings of one author. She has never failed to surprise me, so each time one of her novels comes up for sale, I join the purchase queue in total faith.With that mea culpa out of the way, Patchett is one of the few writers I've read who speaks believably from the point of view of a protagonist who is of the opposite gender. The author and poet Ron Rash can pull this off well. The ""grit lit"" writer Daniel Woodrell and the unique Donna Tartt are also masters. But for this reader. those folks form a small, extremely talented club. They make gender almost seem immaterial - we see the person inside - but at the same time, the little clichés about men not being overly verbal about their emotions and that women are vociferously protective of family are still there. So, yeah. Patchett - in this case - is the man, fully and entirely.You've read the blurb, probably, and know that the story revolves around a pair of adult siblings with a dysfunctional childhood. Their longest stretch of stability was spent with their parents in an enormous and gorgeous old home, and over later decades, the two occasionally park across the street from the grounds and think about the days that were and the people that were.I don't want to spill any more than that because Patchett's stories are best left with little surprises for the reader. For those who are already fans of her work, you'll again bump into the idea that some people are considered to be ""saints"" even though one of the characters nails them as garden variety narcissists. You will find people that love one another like family but who have no biological ties. There is forgiveness in here. And long held grudges. Laughter and love and pain.Lastly, if you've ever had a parent abandon you in some way or share a devoted relationship with a brother or sister, this is going to resonate. Patchett grew up in a blended family, so her wisdom and insights have been a lifetime in formation. And every time her novels close, it feels like they do so with a benediction for us all.Five stars. Favorites shelf."
74,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18643650-mark-porton,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Dutch House by Anne Patchett is a fabulous book.The story is told through the eyes of Danny Conroy. He takes us on an incredible journey involving his parents, his sister, various housekeepers, step-mother, step-sisters, children and many, many others. The story starts not long after the end of WW2, and revolves around an old mansion, previously built and owned by the VanHoebeek family.There’s no need to tell you much about the story other than it’s a complex, layered and believable family saga covering 3 generations. This is my first book by this author (yes, where have I been?) and she just doesn’t miss a beat. Patchett paints such a rich picture, using just the right amount of words, placed exactly where they should be - I felt I was actually there. Even her descriptions of personal features, expressions and body posture, movement – were so accurate I felt like they were better than actually seeing the people myself. This one had me hooked from the beginning, and I was so sad it finished. In fact, I finished it only 30 minutes ago and feel quite emotional about the whole bloody thing. Why did it have to stop now? How can a book just jump into our life, take us on an incredible journey and then leave us, just like that? This was one of those books. I can compare it to my feelings of attachment to the Joad Family in Grapes of Wrath, I still wonder what they’re up to. I cared that much about them. Well it is the same here.Such precise passages like:“We overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it is the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.”For those of us who spend much of our time looking over our shoulder, this is really a passage to make us stop and think. Yes, memories, regrets, the past, feature heavily in this book.Also this little gem:“Thinking about the past impeded my efforts to be decent in the present”How good is that?This book will make you gasp, laugh and cry. For anyone who has been a father, mother, brother, sister…..or let’s just say a ‘human’. There will be something in this book that will resonate with you. This was my first audiobook and Tom Hanks’ narration was first class. Sorry this is such a gushy review but it is what it is.5 Wonderful Stars"

In a twist on the evil stepmother story, we follow the lives of brother and sister Danny and Maeve through their life journeys as seen through Danny's eyes. Each character is fully-fleshed out and the writing is neither too ornate nor too flat. The story is interesting and not over-bearing. I really liked the flow of the text and the use of the Dutch House as a motif throughout the book. The book is written in a retrospective manner which also leads to some introspection as well:But we overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered. (loc. 635)Reflections on being a son:He had protected me from the world so completely that I had no idea what the world was capable of. I had never thought about him as a child. I had never asked him about the war. I had only seen him as my father, and as my father I had judged him. There was nothing to do about that now but add it to the catalog of my mistakes.(loc. 1384)Reflections on life's long journey and out choices - a theme in this book regarding Danny's choices between what he wants and what is expected from him:There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you’d been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet in place, and for a moment you’re suspended, knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself. (loc. 1702)I like this metaphor:We had stepped into the river that takes you forward. (loc. 2640)And this analogy:When she walked away, she turned back to look at me so many times she appeared to be going up the sidewalk in a loose series of concentric circles. (loc. 2793)Danny discovers his mother late in life, but is unsure how to tell Maeve about her:After years of living in response to the past, we had somehow become miraculously unstuck, moving forward in time just like everyone else. To tell Maeve our mother was out there, to tell her I wasn’t sure if our parents had ever divorced, meant reigniting the fire I’d spent my life stamping out. (loc. 2874)A nice reflection on bringing up kids in the city and getting them used to empty spaces of time:In the city of constant stimulation, we had failed to give them the opportunity to develop strong inner lives for those occasions when they would find themselves sitting through the second act of The Nutcracker. (loc 3372)A very typical dream of many fathers, myself included>When Maeve knocked on my door, she woke me from a dream in which I was trying to swim to Kevin. Every stroke I took towards him seemed to push him farther out, until I was struggling to see his head above the water’s chop. I kept calling for him to swim back but he was too far away to hear me. I sat straight up, gasping, trying to make sense of where I was. Then I remembered. I had never been so happy to be awake. (loc. 3473)When she does appear near the end of Maeve's life, Danny sees his mother initially as an agent of death:but she was there now, at Abington Memorial Hospital, like the Angel of Death. I said nothing to her because one should never initiate a conversation with Death.

78,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41788446-hannah,Rating 1 out of 5,"I knew fairly early into this book that I was not the right reader for it. That I finished it has more to do with the format in which I consumed it (the audiobook is narrated by Tom Hanks) than with any hope I had that it would get better. To be fair, there were parts in the middle that worked better for me - but overall, this is just not my type of book at all. It has been described as a modern fairy tale and that is true only in the worst sense: the story is neither magical nor lyrical but the characters are all as flat as the characters in Grimm's fairy tales - they are Patchett's puppet's moving the story along, not always in ways which made sense to me.To illustrate why I am not the right reader, here a few things I dislike in books, in no particular order: family sagas (check), historical fiction (check), evil step parents (check), flat characters (check), undeveloped female characters (check), incredibly detailed narration (check), people being treated unfairly (check), women hating women for no good reason (check), horrible parents (check and check). The structure could have worked for me as it jumps back and forth in time, which is something I often enjoy, but the storyline mostly just bored me. The rambling nature of the narrative worked best for me when there were the smallest emotional stakes: when Danny talks about his education or his real estate dabbling. Whenever the stakes were higher, I became increasingly frustrated. Part of that has to do with Danny being an omnipotent narrator while still being only in his own head, part has to do with how one-note these characters all were. For other people, this book has worked brilliantly (and I can kind of see why if I squint and look at this sideways), for me this was a frustrating slog following a character I found boring and self-involved.Content warning: Death of a loved one, heart attack, abandonement, Alzheimer's DiseaseYou can find this review and other thoughts on books on my blog."

80,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76203549-nika,Rating 2 out of 5,"Having just started this book, I expected to enjoy it but it turned out to be a huge disappointment for me.If the first chapter kept me somewhat interested, starting from the second chapter I felt disconnected from what was happening in the novel.The characters and plot left me completely indifferent. The main idea around which centers the plotline did not speak to me. At the core of the story is the Dutch House, a monumental and cold building. It can seem a forbidding place, but, despite its aloofness or perhaps due to it, the House holds a hardly explicable power over those who inhabit it. The Conroy family bought the house from the impoverished Dutch negociants. Now they expect to live happily in their new home but strange things start to happen... I would be happy to say that they did but in fact nothing special happens. This uneventfulness is typical of the novel.Mrs. Conroy - the mother of two children - develops a strange relationship with the house. It looms so large and terrifying in her imagination that she leaves her children and husband to move to India. We are to believe that Mrs. Conroy can no longer cope with the Dutch House. Well, in my opinion, this explanation does not look credible unless certain details are given.The woman's decision triggers a series of painful events. Soon, another woman appears on the scene and in the Dutch House. Maeve and Danny Conroy - the children of the Conroys - will be the most affected. Their relationship with the house is that of 'love-hate.'The house is probably a metaphor for the problematic past that could be so difficult to overcome.It may also be interpreted as a symbol of childhood traumas that pervade the present and impact the future. This explanation, however, applies to the sister and brother who have been raised in the Dutch House. I can understand this idea but it is difficult for me to connect with it. According to Ann Patchett, the house is ""just symbolic of the life."" Sounds fine but the narration did not convince me. For me, the Dutch House, formidable as it may look, is only a building made of bricks. There are things much more important than that, such as human relationships, compassion, or hobbies. However, the symbolic meaning of the house hardly explains the mother’s attitude and behavior. Why is she so negatively impressed with the building that she prefers to abandon her children without even saying goodbye to them?I am aware that a lot of people find this story engaging. My opinion of it probably belongs to a minority but I must admit, this was a boring and unemotional read for me. I am now trying to find something that I liked about it. The only thing that comes to my mind is that the story did not last too long. In addition, the cover of the book is exquisite."
81,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie-g,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Dutch House is a story about three generations of a family whose relationships are closely connected to a house outside Philadelphia. Cyril Conroy, a real estate developer who made his money renovating old buildings, bought the Dutch House as a surprise for his wife. Cyril loved old buildings, probably more than people, and was proud of his acquisition. His wife, who felt that she had a mission to help poor people, never felt comfortable in a home that looked like a museum and had a ballroom on the third floor. Their children, Maeve and Danny, were left motherless for reasons we find out later in the book. Maeve takes on the role of protector of her little brother, and changes her whole life to care for him.Cyril later meets the manipulative Andrea who covets the Dutch House, and they are soon married. Andrea's interest lies with the house, and not with her stepchildren. The Dutch House is an important part of both the sense of loss and the strong bond shared by Danny and his sister.Narrated by Danny, the story tells about childhood trauma and family relationships. It goes forward and backward in time, slowly showing us the events that molded Danny and Maeve into the people they would become. The close relationships between the siblings was special, and they could always count on each other. Ann Patchett's writing is captivating and humorous. I expect The Dutch House to be an especially good story for book discussion groups. 4.5 stars."

Because I get a lot of her books as donations, and they go as quickly as they come. She is an interesting author, who in my mind, embodies compassion.How would I describe this tale? Paradise Lost dusted with a sprinkling of Cinderella, The Little Princess and perhaps a bit of Hansel and Gretel thrown in?Two bonded siblings, Maeve and Danny Conroy have only each other after their mother leaves them when they are only 10 and 3. Their home is called the Dutch House, a 1922 mansion outside Philadelphia owned by their father, Cyril, bought fully furnished when Maeve was 5. His wife hated it, and flees to India to support the poor. Her family suffers by this loss, and are left with a father who only cares about his real estate. The lust of it. And then...Enter the wicked stepmother with 2 kids of her own. The story is told in first person from Danny's adult POV. Because Danny is by design a clueless tight-lipped character, as readers we aren't sure he really is the best one to be telling this story. His older sister may have been a more interesting character to have told the story. Or better yet, an unbiased narrator. The story focuses on unconventional families - motherless children, blended families and children left too much to their own devices. Does it work?Still...You can feel the themes of gratitude, compassion and forgiveness and a sentimentality throughout. A sense of warmheartedness, too. It's just hard to find sometimes."
83,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4876540-jonetta,Rating 4 out of 5,"Cyril Conroy turns to real estate investment at the end of World War II and transforms his family’s circumstances from impoverishment to wealth. When he surprises them with a move to the Philadelphia suburbs and the purchase of a great mansion called The Dutch House, it also alters the course of everyone he cares about, and not in a good way. Their stories are told through his son Danny and spans several decades, providing a view of how their futures are shaped by the ensuing events. Tom Hanks narrates the audio version of the book and felt like the perfect choice for Danny Conroy. The character was fairly dispassionate, a creation of his upbringing as he was shielded from the wreckage of his parents’ marriage and history. He was too young to recall much of it and his sister Maeve protected him beyond adulthood. Hanks’ performance was outstanding in that regard as he personified Danny. But Maeve was the more complex character and we only see her through his eyes. But, that made her all the more enigmatic and tragic as her world seemed to evolve around his. This is a long saga without a lot of dramatic moments but does have significant, pivotal events that permanently define Danny and Maeve. They sometimes served them well but also stunted their ability to form deep relationships as adults. I enjoyed their journey and was captivated by the story. I didn’t always like Danny but understood him. But it is Maeve who got my admiration and empathy, someone I wanted to know more about but love that she’s left to my imagination. And, The Dutch House was always in the background. It’s an ideal story for book group discussions.Posted on Blue Mood Café"
84,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75748905-elizabeth,Rating 3 out of 5,"Elna Conroy sheds all her worldly possessions—leaving her husband behind and young children Danny and Maeve adrift in the tranquil suburbs of Elkins Park, Philadelphia—to dedicate her life to the impoverished in all corners of the world. It is circa 1950, and also left behind is the breathtaking three-story mansion that is the Dutch House, replete with a ballroom, marble floors, gilded ceilings, vast windows, and the arresting portraits of the previous VanHoebeek residents. Ann Patchett has masterfully injected life into the relics of the Gilded Age New England mansions, children and nannies and cooks flitting through these lavish halls in a fairy-tale narration by Danny. Reflecting most on his youth and the aftermath in decades later, this story relives a past populated by Mr. Conroy, remiss to warm his children with nurture and compassion, and the clear villain, Cinderella’s stepmother come to life in the form of his second wife Andrea, a package deal with two daughters not much younger than Danny and Maeve. The Dutch House is concerned of course with the repercussions when Danny and Maeve are unceremoniously ousted from their childhood home after Mr. Conroy passes away, straight back into the poverty their father had escaped from. A window into this progression of events invokes the kind of pulsing anger that eats at your chest, as you must also swallow the bitter pills of snubs and cold silence and inaction that children never should. It is the kind of change in a childhood that leaves little gray area to debate, distinctly horrible yet unstoppable nevertheless. And so, these myriad traps are primed in the past even as the Dutch House becomes a distant memory and Danny and Maeve both forge successful paths into adulthood. So inevitably they return, no longer welcome in the House but parked in a Volkswagen, the Oldsmobile, the Volvos, inhaling cigarette smoke with nostalgic memories and a past-present mirage about the unanswered questions of their childhood. 
There was no extra time in those days and I didn’t want to spend the little of it I had sitting in front of the goddamn house, but that’s where we wound up: like swallows, like salmon, we were the helpless captives of our migratory patterns.
I would never trade away Patchett’s magnificently executed quippy dialogue, dark humor, and effortless descriptions, but I needed this to be matched by equal development of the characters. I was desperate to crack open their skulls, to carefully examine their true thoughts and motivations. A reticent father and an absent mother are aspects I could come to accept of a childhood fraught with maddening experiences, but dangling all this potential only to have such a reticent protagonist in Danny just felt unfair. What did come through was Danny’s self-absorption and, frankly, petulant monologue. He is a rich boy muddled into unfair circumstances, soaking up a rainshower of tragedies but resistant to the responsibility of taking off the coat. He is at least self-aware enough to admit his faults, though does next to nothing to address them, so I couldn’t even blame him for ignorance. From childhood to adulthood, he is a boy in a world that demands he grow up too soon—except he doesn’t really grow up. At each step of the way, his older sister Maeve has provided a steady and unconditional love that his parents never did. Danny’s unfettered adulation of his sister filters through his narrative lens, and I couldn’t help but champion her brilliance, humor, and pragmatism. His regrets, then, also shine through, as he acknowledges an imperfect understanding of her innermost desires despite their closeness. Always from his perspective, I never could see her as much more than a sacrificial lamb. Wholly dedicated to caring for him, just as later his wife is characterized. There are so many passive moments and no real heroes throughout this family saga in The Dutch House, and if I must come to terms with how people reconcile the past and choose whether to forgive amid the more eyebrow-raising plot points of this fairy tale, I at the very least can’t afford to miss a deep connection to the central characters."

Warning lovers of this book - I'm about to get unapologetically vicious. Remember, this is all my opinion, even if I structure sentences so that they read as factual. I would never have read this book were it not my next book club read. I should have known from the blurb that there would be nothing good about this book. It consisted of merely seven lines of text in what I can only assume is size 20 font. I haven't seen such a blurb since I was five and read picture books. What a vapid and empty book. I'm baffled by the popularity of it. It was as insightful and enlightening as watching reality television for five hours. There's no purpose (let alone poetry) behind anything that happens in this book. The characters are as basic as those in a creative writing class for eight-year-olds, as is the novel's drive. The Dutch house is special. Why it's special, we don't know. Their mother hated it so much that she abandoned her family to leave it. What was so horrible about it, we don't know. People hate other people. Why they hate other people, we don't know. We're supposed to care about the main characters. Why we should care about the main characters, we don't know. Everyone wants to be part of this damn house. Why they want to be, we don't know.There's nothing emotionally tangible about this book. There's no atmosphere, no connection, voices or emotion. People marry just for the sake of having a marriage and baby as part of the plot - why they married who they married, we don't know. We don't get to know anyone. Their voices are entirely uniform, and there are no identifying markers, real backstory or essence or soul. Why does everyone either love or hate this house? Why should I care? Everything was just so primitive. It was like Pratchett just knew the fundamentals of writing that everyone is taught at school and wrote them out in the most vacuous way. People get sad when there's a death, so let's have some death. People like marriage and babies, so let's have some of that too. People like everything to end up happily ever after even if it's not realistic, so let's make that happen. There was so little artistic prowess in this novel that I wouldn't have been surprised if she ended the book with ""and Danny woke up, and it was all a dream'. It was THAT level of sophistication. "

Just him reading the chapter headings was thrilling, and he gave so much MORE! My biggest regret is getting SO into the story that I mostly stopped realized that Tom Hanks was reading to me. Bravo Ann Patchett and Tom Hanks. This is a story about a house that several families have lived in and the lives that have been touched by residing in this house at one time or another. It is about the coming of age and the adult life of a boy named Danny. Danny's life is inexorably influenced entirely by the Dutch House, with memories both good and bad and the reverberations of many things set into motion by both love and hatred of the house. This one was quite enjoyable, a solid 4 stars. I really liked it. And I REALLY hated Andrea."
89,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1213607-julie,Rating 4 out of 5,"Danny Conroy and his older sister, Maeve, sit in Maeve's car across the street from their childhood home, watching, waiting, reviving the ghosts of their memories. They catch an occasional glimpse of their stepmother, Andrea, who turned them out of the house soon after their father died, when Danny was in high school and Maeve was in college, but they leave her be. There are deeper wounds than an evil stepmother to contend with, and even though the mansion they spy upon has enormous windows that provide views from front to back, the source of their pain — and their healing — is not visible. The Dutch House, so named for its Depression-era builders, the VanHoebeeks from the Netherlands, is a bizarrely baroque edifice, purchased in secret by Danny and Maeve's father, Cyril, in 1946. Maeve was five and Danny would be born two years later. Cyril Conroy had been quietly amassing a small fortune by speculating in New York City real estate, and came upon this mansion in the countryside near Philadelphia, falling for its in-your-face declaration of wealth. Cyril presents it to his wife, Elna, who recoils at its opulence and the servants Cyril has hired to help manage the estate. Elna, so disturbed by a life that feels imposed on her by Cyril's grasping ambitions, eventually abandons her two young children and vanishes, supposedly settling in India to minister to the poor. A few years later, Cyril marries Andrea, eighteen years his junior, barely older than Maeve herself. Andrea has two little girls of her own and quickly takes charge of The Dutch House, her resentment of Cyril's first family building to a near-unforgivable vindictiveness that results in Maeve and Danny's expulsion. The Dutch House is grounded in Danny's first-person perspective as he gently unknots forty years of familial entanglements. In contrast to Danny's matter-of-fact memories is a shimmering fairy tale nostalgia of gingerbread houses, a wicked stepmother, the Hansel and Gretel bond between brother and sister, a long-lost mother, even the Rapunzel-like quality of Maeve's long, dark hair. Some Ann Patchett novels have taken my breath away (Bel Canto), others have left me less moved. The Dutch House succeeds for me because of the strength of its characters, who are allowed to grow and reach, creating a story in their wake. Tales of fortunes won and lost over decades, a panorama of post-war American culture, unhappy families, the ebbs and flows of marriage — these are all familiar themes that become fresh and urgent by the strength of Patchett's Danny and Maeve and their voices. Told with reflective compassion, gentle irony, and vivid nostalgia for an America long-gone, The Dutch House is a deeply satisfying family drama."

The business-savvy Cyril Conroy buys the house and everything in it to surprise his wife, Elma and their young children, Maeve and Danny. Overwhelmed by the huge change from living frugally in a very small house to living in a grand old house, with a cook, a cleaner and a nanny, the young mother eventually abandons her family.Written from Danny's point of view, this is a novel about family, abandonment and its effects, hanging on the past and not letting go. Danny's sister, Maeve, seven years his senior, becomes his mentor and protector, while the two sisters working as cook and cleaner, respectively, take on the caring roles.When things get worse for the two siblings, their relationship is what gives them strength, their intelligence and ambition what propels them further to outward success.The Dutch House features prominently throughout the novel. Detested, loved, admired, longed for, the house pulls at the hearts and memories of those who lived in it.Spanning over five decades, at times, the story sags as it becomes quite mundane. But it's very readable; the details, the little scenes and recollections make it very lifelike. You know how it is, you're a teen, then you study, begin your grown-up life and then, bam! you wonder what happened to time, when did you get to be forty, fifty etc. The last quarter picks up the pace, quite a lot happens.I thoroughly enjoyed this novel, the characterisations were excellent, the descriptions, of the house in particular, were quite vivid. The siblings' relationship was incredibly tight and unique.This was different, in a good way. Highly recommended. I've received this novel via Edelweiss, in exchange for an honest review."
91,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6700518-lorna,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Dutch House is the latest novel by one of my favorite authors Ann Patchett. This character driven family saga centers around the powerful relationship between siblings Maeve and Danny Conroy as well as their strong connection, and almost pathological ties, to The Dutch House. This beautiful mansion was built by the VanHoebeeks in the suburbs of Philadelphia in 1922 making their fortune in cigarettes; their life-sized portrait so much a part of the Conroy family in many ways. I must interject that the cover of the book that is a portrait of Maeve is priceless. There is a message here. Their father, Cyril Conroy, a real estate mogul able to capitalize on a lot of real estate deals in New York City enabling him to purchase this iconic house where Danny and Maeve spent their childhood. Without any spoilers, what transpires over the years is the exploration of the bonds between Maeve and Danny as they grow into adulthood and how The Dutch House impacts their lives over a lifetime. Told in the point of view of Danny over the years, it is subject to memory and is very non-linear in its unfolding as we jump to different periods in their life. All in all, it is a very heartwarming book that I enjoyed.""The stunning success of the house could be attributed to the architect. . .""""It could be that one or both of those dour VanHoebeeks had been sort of aesthetic visionary, or that the property inspired a marvel beyond what any of them had imagined, or that America after the First World War was teeming with craftsmen who worked to standards long since abandoned.

The 1920’s mansion comes complete with staff, life-size portraits of the original Dutch owners, a third floor ballroom, and a perfect window seat. Elna, who grew up poor, hates the extravagance of the house. She runs away to serve the poor, abandoning her 10-year-old daughter, Maeve, and three-year-old son, Danny, to the hands of their rigid and cold father.Five years later, Maeve and Danny are called downstairs to meet Conroy’s soon-to-be second wife, Andrea. The second Mrs. Conroy adores the house and all the money that goes along with it. When Cyril dies, she keeps the house and the money and dispossesses Maeve and Danny of any inheritance except for funds for Danny’s education. Danny and Maeve creatively use the education trust fund to send Danny to Choate, Columbia, and medical school, despite the simple fact he has absolutely no desire to become a doctor. REVIEWTHE DUTCH HOUSE is a perfect blend of characters, setting and story. It’s undoubtably my favorite book of the year. ANN PATCHETT has long been my favorite author, and this book is one of her best. It’s masterfully written to capture the poignant relationship and unbreakable bonds between Danny and Maeve. A grown Danny narrates the story casting his sister as his unwavering friend and protector.I didn’t want the book to end, and deliberately savored it a little slower that usual. The Dutch house vividly comes to life on the pages. We can see all the way from the driveway through the house to the conservatory, and we can see the little blue kitchen table where Danny frequently had his meals and did his homework and it is so easy to picture the large portrait hanging on the wall of the drawing room of a bright-eyed Maeve in her red coat, with her long thick black hair laying over her shoulders.The story thoughtfully explores abandonment, inheritance, obsession, family relationships, love and forgiveness. PATCHETT is a lyrical storyteller and her characters development is first rate. My favorite part of the novel is the shared moments between Danny and Maeve, sitting in Maeve’s car in front of the Dutch House long after they had been expelled from the only home they had known. THE DUTCH HOUSE is a beautiful and strong testament to sibling bonds. Thanks to Edelweiss, Harper Collins and Ann Patchett for an advance reading copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

Despite the fact that Patchett is an author I’ve wanted to read for a long time -- I’ve had most of her previous works on my TBR for quite some time and even own physical copies of several of her books -- I unfortunately have not had the opportunity to actually crack open any of them. Of course, all that changed last week when I saw that the next book on my seemingly never-ending ARC list would be Patchett’s newly released eighth novel 
The Dutch House
 (published in September 2019) – I was thrilled that I would finally be able to experience one of her works for myself, though at the same time, that also meant I would be going into this one with relatively high expectations. Luckily, this one ended up being a wonderful read, even better than I expected, which honestly doesn’t happen often.The story is narrated entirely from the perspective of Danny Conroy, who is only a boy of 8 years old when the story opens. His sister Maeve, herself only a teenager at 15 years old, took Danny under her care after their mother Elna left them 5 years ago. Both children live in the Dutch House, a see-through glass mansion of sorts that their father Cyril, a real estate developer, had bought as a surprise gift for their mother. Cyril is a distant father who is always consumed with his work and aside from providing his children with the necessities — a cook to prepare food for them to eat, a housekeeper to tend to the household duties, a nanny to tend to their day-to-day needs — he could never be bothered with much else beyond that. But Maeve and Danny had each other to lean on and along with the love of their housekeeper and cook (sisters Sandy and Jocelyn who had been hired by their mother back in the day), they were relatively happy and content with their lives. All that changes however when Cyril decides to marry a young woman named Andrea, who moves into the Dutch House with her 2 daughters in tow — the profound impact that this decision ends up having on Danny’s and Maeve’s futures becomes the basis upon which the entire story revolves.This story is billed as a family saga spanning 5 decades, which initially made me think that it would be so epic in scope that it would take a longer time to read, but in actuality, I devoured this one, not wanting to put it down once I started. Patchett is a masterful storyteller and her writing here absolutely captivates — I was hooked from the very first page, not just to the story but also to the characters. It’s extremely rare for me to already like and connect with a story’s characters within the first few chapters, but that’s exactly what happened with Danny and Maeve — two characters I loved from the beginning and who continued to grow more endearing as the story progressed. While all of Patchett’s characters in here were nuanced and well-developed (even most of the minor characters), what made me gravitate to Danny and Maeve the most was the unshakable bond that these two siblings shared throughout their lives – a bond that continued to exist despite everything that happens, no matter how many times their relationship is put to the test. Needless to say, I was genuinely moved by their relationship. Speaking of characters, of course the Dutch House itself also existed as a “character” central to the story, however the beauty here is that, even though its presence was continually felt throughout the story, it never once overtook the other characters. Despite the house’s significance to the plot, it was quite clear from beginning to end that the story itself belonged to Maeve and Danny. In this regard, the house serves as a connection to their past and while this past is what shapes who they eventually grow up to become as adults, it is also how they deal with this past that forms the crux of their story. Here, again, the brilliance of Patchett’s writing comes into play, as the transitions between past and present throughout the book were seamless – no easy feat given the extensive timeline that the story covered plus the fact that the plot jumped around from one situation to the next in no particular order.Up until the last few chapters, this actually had all the makings of a 5-star read for me – the reason I eventually decided on 4.5 stars was mainly because I wasn’t fond of the ending and also didn’t like how a few plot points played out in the lasts few chapters. Though I must admit that I also had some issues with the character of Elna Conroy (Danny and Maeve’s mother) – things that made her character come across too unrealistic for me and made it difficult for me to wholeheartedly accept some of the situations that happen because of it. This small complaint aside, I still consider this book a masterpiece – not quite perfect, but a masterpiece nonetheless. While I eagerly wait to see what Patchett has in store for us next, there’s no doubt that I will be exploring her backlist of previous works very, very soon!Received ARC from Harper via Edelweiss. "
97,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/121021140-ushashi,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Dutch House is a family drama. It's not high on the plot. It's a study of characters and exploration of relationships. It's a dysfunctional family, neither the characters are perfect, nor are their relations. And yet there is something charming and relatable about them. The main focus here is on the relation between the narrator Danny and his elder sister Maeve. I often felt that a modern brother-sister relation is not that well represented in literature, and this was just delightful. The Dutch House is also fairy tale-esque, with a palatial mansion, evil stepmother, orphaned children. This is story-telling at its best. Tom Hanks' narration was just perfect. If you are into audiobooks or like Mr. Hanks (who doesn't!), consider listening to this."

Such an important word, one that conjures both memories, dreams, and nightmares. So many phrases have used this word: A home is where the heart is, A house is not a home, A woman's place is in the home (Elna and I do not agree with this one),You can never go home, A home is a man's castle, and so many more. Most, however, do not become obsessed by a past home. For many reasons Mauve and Danny do, and this obsession continues with Danny's daughter May. I think Mauve and Celeste's reciting of Philip Larkin's poem Home Is So Sad is very significant and paramount to this obsession.There are so many important elements in this book that have been beautifully detailed by other reviewers. Love between siblings in this book and siblings throughout history, loss. forgiveness, hope, and following your dreams, or not, among others. I think timing, both good timing and not so good is also an important element. Elna enters their life again by chance timing. Danny after finishing medical school says, ""I'll have to go out and find a job and that won't be the right time. I can say that for the rest of my life, can't I? This isn't the right time."" Danny meets Celeste due to a missed train. He works hard to finish his medical training, not because he enjoys it but because he doesn't want to get drafted. He believes Celeste was ""the ultimate victim of bad timing, thinking that because she was good at chemistry she should marry a doctor instead of becoming one herself."" But was that really what Celeste wanted? Did Mauve really want to further her education? Danny is just like Celeste and Mauve. They all thought they knew what was best for someone else. A doctor was not Danny's dream profession. He followed his dream of buying and fixing buildings. He was successful at this but he could not fix the past.Anne Patchett has long been a favorite author of mine This book is yet another example of her fine writing style. Her characters are so real with their strengths and flaws rawly exposed. No matter how dire or solemn a situation is that Patchett describes there is a grain, a dash, of humor, enough to bring a smile to the reader's face.This is an October bookclub selection and I am anxiously anticipating our discussion of this enjoyable, complex book.

99,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9827967-deb,Rating 5 out of 5,"“There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you’d been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to stand on is not yet in place, and for a moment you’re suspended, knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself.”When I read this sentence in The Dutch House by Ann Patchett, my adoration for her writing was again reinforced, and I almost needed to read no further. Her ability as a wordsmith at times is so poetic, cuttingly painful and spare in its description of the most traumatic moments caught in ordinary time, in ordinary lives... But of course I continued to read, to discover more of Patchett’s wondrous offerings. Danny and Maeve suffer through interminable losses, which begin at an early point during their lifetimes and The Dutch House figures prominently throughout as a figurehead of that loss. “The Dutch House was impossible. I had never thought that before. When Maeve told me that our mother had hated it, I couldn’t even understand what she was saying. ... I could feel the entire house sitting on top of me like a shell I would have to drag around for the rest of my life.”The delicacy of this novel’s writing is found in how these siblings nurture each other, try to find a sense of home in each other while the world outside of them with more “normal” upbringings and trappings live somewhat on their outskirts and truly cannot fathom the need for their bond. Patchett manages in her books to describe relationships which are on the outskirts, wrought by trauma and the people who try to survive them as well as possible - and describe how beauty might be wrought from the ruin nevertheless. The Dutch House is a gorgeous example of Patchett at her best. The ending is hopeful and a trifle more fairytale than truth. The Dutch House, though, is fictitious too, so who am I to split hairs with this otherwise heart healing fable? An exquisite tapestry of imagery, characters whom I came to love dearly and a sigh of contentment at closing the final page. It doesn’t get much better than this. Five gracious stars. "

It was very enjoyable.It is the story of Maeve and Danny Conroy narrated by by Tom Hanks, told in the voice of Danny.Cyril Conroy buys this amazing house to surprise his wife. It is called the Dutch House. His wife dislikes it from the beginning. She abandons her husband and children to help the poor. Maeve and Danny have a strong bond to one another. Cyril remarries and the ugly stepmother tells Danny he must leave, after the death of his father.Maeve was already on her own.As the years go on Danny and Maeve reflect on their lives at the Dutch House. They even go and park the car in front of it and just watch it, when they are no longer living there.This book is beautifully written. The descriptions of the Dutch House are magnificent.This is the story of family and relationships. What is felt like to be abandoned by your mother and forgiveness."

It’s a building with huge, wide windows, giving every passerby the opportunity to look inside. A function reflected by Danny’s narration. He offers a way in, clear-eyed but still intensely personal. It’s a story about everything and nothing, detailing how family dynamics are affected by the Dutch House and each other. It’s a dream for book clubs, full to the brim of characters that affect you in ways that are as much due to the real people of whom they remind you as their roles within the story. It’s full of questions that invite judgement and decisions that demand reactions. Overall, it's effectively done, more gripping than the details of the plot might suggest, and with a genuinely affecting sibling relationship at its heart. ARC via Netgalley"

The cover was the best part, that's what.Everything else was a Humpty Dumpty of a story, balancing on a pile of hard to believe premises for this quiet family drama. Actually I was thinking of the list of stuff that I find utterly unbelievable in this book, but I don't want to spoil on one hand, and on another - I am not going to not recommend this book. I think that just maybe it's not for me. I believe that someone might actually enjoy it, maybe people who can relate to siblings' problems, I don't know, Cinderella, Snow White? Hamlet???And I'm going to be fair - the beginning was interesting, attracting at least, so was the final twist (quite a weird one), but between those two was a vast sea of BOREDOM. I was wondering if it was done on purpose as a metaphor to show us life that Danny and Maeve were living after the Expulsion from the Garden of Eden, I mean - the Dutch House. Not like their life was too exciting before the expulsion... I couldn't see it this way at all.Well, thanks gods I can deal with boring if it's well written. And it was well written, otherwise I would probably drop it somewhere on page 100, but... Like one of my teachers used to say - constructed by all the rules, but no spark of life in it. I would probably prefer it as one of those Hallmark movies - while equally forgettable it would be much more merciful to the time spent watching it.All in all - you might actually end up liking it.

I think this is a classic case of it's-not-you-it's-me. I found the writing adept but prosaic; fine for a plot-driven novel but this was more character-driven, and in these sorts of novels I prefer more ""literary"" fiction (even though I tend to avoid that term because of various reasons) with devices such as stream-of-consciousness, poetic prose, etc, especially if written in the first person, which this is. The writing wasn't bad by any means, and there were a couple of deft turns of phrase, but overall i just think it didn't fit with the character-driven nature of the book. This is just my preference, though, and a lot of people really enjoyed this. I'd keep away if you prefer more flowery writing in your character-driven books, but if you hate that sort of thing (which a lot of people do) then you might like this. But it just fell flat for me.

106,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38727943-jenna,Rating 4 out of 5,"Well, this book needs another review like Tom Hanks needs another Oscar... ...wait a minute...HAS Tom Hanks won an Oscar?? One sec......Ok, we’re cool! Thanks for waiting! He does have one, whew. Two, in fact!* Although, to be fair, it’s been a while. Anywho, my point here is that: Wouldn’t it be absolutely amazing to be one of those artists of some sort - literary, or of stage and film or whatnot - who retain integrity and exemplify skill while also remaining palatable, nay, even pleasurable, and in general kind of infallible?As an inconsistent hot and cold ADHD-riddled late-bloomer (still waiting!), I’m absolutely enthralled by those artists/scientists who embody and exceed solid consistency, the ones you’d always choose to safely land the plane of your precious, goose-addled attention in the torrid, soiled Hudson of your human consciousness.How, in the actual fuck, are there artists who are so good at that, and whose souvenir gold lapel wings you’d gladly not only sport on your most carefree weekend warrior red eye getaway, but also strive to safeguard for the ages and confer to your descendants? What I’m trying to say is, Ann Patchett, along with Tom Hanks (recent audiobook Beatrice to the Dante of her prose, and that’s why he’s here): I mean, they just don’t seem capable of significantly quantifiable missteps. Take a gander (ha! I’m sorry - just kinda obsessed with Sully) at the lists of their works. Sure, you may not like them all. You may have your favorites. For instance, I’m more of a Commonwealth gal myself. But, as their records presently stand, you’d be hard pressed to majorly sway either popular or critical tomato-meters in their general disfavor. They.are.just.good. That ship has sailed... and! ...Captain Phillips is at the helm! sorry couldn’t resist!!But, you would be reading this review to learn more about The Dutch House, not about my preoccupation with transportation-centric Hanks films. So, here is a quick recap of some specific identified reasons why this book is good:-It’s Goldfinch-adjacent/reminiscent, as other far wiser reader/reviewers have also confirmed. But, minus the explosions and international art thievery - omissions which can ONLY improve a book written by anyone OTHER than Donna Tartt!-The whole House as Character thing, and who does not have a big fat red carpet Welcome Mat for that??-I mean seriously, it’s like you’re not even “reading” a Patchett book when you are reading it; it’s not even like you are watching a movie (not even a Tom Hanks movie!): this crazy phenomenon happens with her effortless prose where you are just somehow “living” the book. I personally felt like I aged thirty years or whatever while reading this, in the best possible way, and that I enjoyed this is especially shocking because aging is my most actively coming horribly true by the millisecond fear.-Super character driven, but, like, just enough stuff happens also?-Families and money, parents and siblings, Fa la la la la, la la la la! Happy holidays! :-)-That kind of historical fiction that’s just baaaarely on the cusp of being historical (just like many of us readers, har har!).-People who simply cannot let go of grudges, and the havoc wrought on self/other by both these grudges and the intractable retention thereof. This book portrays nothing if not the giant grudge match that is immediate and extended family, whether via passive aggressive virtue signaling or outright vengeance plots.-Like baroque wallpapering, people are destined to endlessly and elaborately repeat the often nonsensical behavioral and relational coping patterns of their ways, or of the ways others have modeled for them. Do I have anything bad to say about this book? - unlike The Goldfinch, I didn’t rate it a 5, after all? Sure, I could compile a shortlist of questions, continuity errors, and conspiracy theories, including but not limited to the ending of the book, which increasingly felt like I was reading a different book and, ultimately, something more worthy of the Lifetime or CW (the daughter May stuff? Come ON!) networks rather than the big screen? Plenty of other reviewers have already commented on all of this, and so I’ll let them tell you about it.I think some even great authors just have trouble landing a book sometimes - let’s not forget that even The Goldfinch ended with basically an essay, and I’m sorry, love the book, but that IS cheating - and The Dutch House is definitely not a Sully-caliber landing (no, I can’t let it rest). But even though I think it would have been better with an explicitly more bittersweet, Cast Away-style ending, this book, and Patchett, still remain...in a League of Their Own. :-)*Best Actor for Philadelphia (1993) and Forrest Gump (1994)"

When each and every aspect is amazing in and of itself, but then the whole is even GREATER than its parts. You can't explain why, but you know you just read something incredible. That was what this book was like for me. The setting, the characters, the dialogue, the story, the audio narration, the book cover... EVERYTHING! For me, this book was sheer perfection, and I adored it! Patchett creates a feel for this story that is both real-life and dark fairy tale at the same time. The characters feel real, with all their flaws and quirkiness, and Patchett explores real themes, like familial love, sibling relationship, abandonment, inheritance, obsession, forgiveness, and more. But there's also this hint of a dreamy, dark fairy tale feel to the story, with a long-lost mother, an evil stepmother, and a brother and sister cast out. The result is a highly enticing narrative that draws you in and keeps you turning pages.Patchett is a master storyteller down to every single microscopic detail - the house/mansion really comes alive as a character itself, inseparable from the story. Even the gorgeous book cover of the painting that was in the house... Patchett had an artist friend actually create the painting specifically to use for the cover. And, finally, using Tom Hanks as audio narrator was a brilliant touch for this book! The story is told first-person narrative by the brother Danny, and Tom Hank's portrayal of him was just perfect, elevating the book to TEN STARS for me! This experience is one that is resonating with me long after I listened to the last word."

The Dutch House is a journey through life that focuses on the terrible consequences of miscommunications, and how intentions are so easily misunderstood; how it is nearly always impossible to repair trust and pride when it has been damaged; how the seeds of discontent and regret are quick to grow, and how bad memories can haunt a house for generations. This is also a story that is tender and touching, a homage to all the siblings who step up to care for their families, all of the love that endures ongoing hardships. Thoughtful and wistful, this saga of misfortunes and perseverance is a sentimental walk thorough time and memory. "

I often find it very hard to get into audiobooks and end up stopping and moving to an actual book, but he really just brought the story to life. This book was very well written. The characters and their relationships were done exceptionally well and were extremely relatable. The story is very much about the love and connection between siblings, which I really related with, and the meaning of home. It also has a strong message about how much the decisions we make affect others. It can often affect them more than we even know because it can be hard to come to terms with the repercussions of a decision that affects you so much but that you had no say in. That loss of control can be hard to reckon with.Overall, I thought this book was really beautiful and I definitely recommend it!"

Date: September 24, 2019After reading a mystery, a feel-good story, and a psychological thriller, this reviewer felt overjoyed to sink my teeth into literary fiction once again. I can and do appreciate some contemporary reads, but this mythical novel felt like coming home, especially since the story explores the meaning of home itself. It is not a spoiler to point out that this is a family-saga disguised as a dark fairy tale revolving around a house. The author breathes as much life into the house as the characters. It is not farfetched to say that the house itself is the main protagonist.The book begins in 1946 when a real estate mogul buys a fully furnished, Gatsby-like mansion, as a surprise for his wife. Turns out that she hates the house, but his five-year-old daughter loves it. Their son is born 8 years later. The narrative jumps around in time through the son’s voice. When the boy is three-years-old, his mother deserts the family, leaving the siblings devastated. This is how his older sister becomes his main caretaker. The bond between them is unwavering, even when the boy is a grown man. Their closeness puts a strain on his marriage. When the siblings are 12 and 19 years old, their father marries a young widow with two little girls of her own. The wicked stepmother has arrived. When the older sister visits home during a college break, she discovers that her stepmother has given her bedroom—which is the best room in the house—to her little stepsisters. An unused room in the attic is now her bedroom.The author does a good job of showing rage through humor throughout the novel. When the older sister learns about the room change she laughs and says, “It’s just like ‘The Little Princess!’ when the girl (Shirley Temple in the movie version of the book), loses all of her money and so they put her in the attic.” She demonstrates this skill with all of her characters, including the loving and long-suffering nanny, cook and housekeeper. The only small room in the house is the kitchen. As the cook says, “that was because the only people ever meant to see the kitchen were the servants.”It would be wise to remember that you are reading a fairytale, if not the book will feel unrealistic. Put in the fairytale genre, the story is as fascinating as the author’s 2011 novel, “State of Wonder,” which also has a mythical feel. “House” stayed with me after I finished the book. I deliberately did not read the initial reviews. (I missed the ARC reviewers’ suggested deadline on this one). I came to believe that the book is mostly a coming-of-age story, as well as a reflection on one’s childhood as an adult. The author seems to ask the question, ‘Why do we repeat the same mistakes as our parents?’ In addition, she wonders, ‘Why do some of us have childhoods that could have been written by the Brothers Grimm?’ Finally, ‘What might one may need to accomplish to change our life story’s ending?’I received this Advance Review Copy (ARC) novel from the publisher at no cost in exchange for an honest review.Find all my book reviews at: https://www.goodreads.com/review/list...https://books6259.wordpress.com/https://www.barnesandnoble.com/review...https://www.facebook.com/martie.neesr...https://www.instagram.com/martie6947/https://www.pinterest.com/martienreco...\https://www.amazon.com/https://twitter.com/NeesRecord"

Y pensándolo ahora, después de terminarlo, creo que es cierto.Tiene muchas cosas que te recuerda a los cuentos clásicos: la falta de la figura de la madre, una madrastra mala(¿?), un padre que apenas aparece por la vida de sus hijos, los niños que finalmente son apartados de su hogar...Obviamente no todo es como en los cuentos, y creo que la autora ha creado una trama bastante realista, y por ello bastante cruda.Quizás lo que más llamó mi atención, y no para bien en este caso, es que los protagonistas (los dos hermanos) empiezan y terminan igual, o al menos su forma de expresarse y de hablar es igual; no importa que tengan 15 y 22, o que tengan 45 y 52.Aun así tanto ella como él caen bien y eso ayuda.Un libro entretenido, con una trama que te hará cabrear, que te hará sonreír, que te hará pensar, que te hará sentir."

The Dutch House has a ballroom on the third floor, a swimming pool and too many stairs for a man with a bad leg. Conroy is a man obsessed with buildings; his wife, uncomfortable with the wealth – a woman who desires always to help the poor and referred to, more than once, as ‘a modern day saint’ – flees the house and leave behind her husband and children, Maeve and Danny.The novel is told through the point of view of Danny, for whom The Dutch House becomes the centre of his life and, later, the symbol of what he and Maeve has lost. For Cyril remarries the cold, calculating Andrea, who moves into the house with her two daughters. Soon, change comes to the house – Maeve is moved from her beloved room, with the window seat. Later, the two, find themselves outside the house and, as time moves backwards and forwards, they find themselves drawn back, again and again, to sit outside the house, contemplating their changed lives.This is a story about family and what that means. It is about the relationship between Danny and Maeve, and the stresses his relationship with his sister, later causes with his wife. It is about two wives; one who left a house, one who coveted it. Of course, it is about the house and what it comes to represent to those involved in it. An excellent novel and a good choice for reading groups, with much to discuss. "

She was a woman that needed to be needed—to give back to those less fortunate. Her children weren’t enough, so she ultimately left them and her husband.The second Mrs. Conroy loved the house and everything in the house—except her husband and the children from his first marriage. So, when Cyril passed away, she kicked out 15-year-old Danny and 22-year-old Maeve. Andrea also absconded with all of their inheritance except for an education fund for Danny. All they had left was each other!Patchett follows the brother/sister relationship for the next five decades. Maeve assumes the ‘mother’ role for her younger brother. Danny is a stubborn guy—often oblivious to his sister’s and wife’s needs. The rejection by their biological mother, and their step-mother haunted them for years. They often made pilgrimages to the Dutch House—the last place they knew their parents.Patchett’s ending seems disjointed from the rest of the novel.

I enjoyed Commonwealth, probably more than the Dutch House, because years later I can still recall the characters and that forbidden kiss that opens that novel. For me, there is less that is memorable about the Dutch House - but this is not to say it isn't equal in its ability to enmesh the reader fully in the story, which is altogether more disturbing and darkly themed. Twisting and turning across five decade, this is emotionally turbo charged family drama. Set around the odd but iconic ""Dutch House"", it is principally a story of two siblings, intrinsically linked by the pain and frought memories of their bleak childhood. It is about opportunities forgone, abandonment and reminiscence, but mostly, it is about reconcilliation. Patchett invites us to ponder, what we are prepared to live with and what we are prepared to forgive, and at what point do we walk away from those that continually hurt us? It reminded me of the Buddhist mantra, ""without forgiveness we have nothing..."" but what happens when in offering our forgiveness we are ultimately rejected? Patchett craftily weaves a story based on memory and forgiveness, where the characters (and the readers) are frequently faced with these questions - we may forgive what is done to us, but we will not forget it."

127,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,Rating 4 out of 5,"Maeve and Danny Conroy are an inseparable brother-and-sister pair. Their mother left when Danny was little, so his older sister played a maternal role, too. And when their father dies, they become like Hansel and Gretel (or Cinderella and her little brother): cast out into the wilds by an evil stepmother who takes possession of the only home they’ve ever known, a suburban Philadelphia mansion built on the proceeds of the VanHoebeeks’ cigarette empire.It’s interesting to see Patchett take on a male perspective in this novel; she does it utterly convincingly. I also loved the medical threads running through: Maeve is diagnosed with diabetes as a teenager, and Danny spends many years in medical training even though his only ambition is to follow in his father’s footsteps as a property developer. There was a stretch in the middle of the book – something like 46% to 58% – when I was really bored with Danny’s dithering (‘but I don’t want to be a doctor … but I don’t want to marry Celeste’), and the chronology is unnecessarily complicated by flashbacks, though this is, I think, meant to convey Danny’s desultory composition of his memoirs.In the end I didn’t like this quite as much as Commonwealth, but it’s a winning exploration of family secrets and memories. As the decades pass you see how what happened to Maeve and Danny has been turned into myth: a story they repeat to themselves about how they were usurped until the narrative has more power than the reality. Readers, meanwhile, are invited to question the people and places we base our security on, and to imagine what it would mean to forgive and forget and start living in a different way. Patchett is always so good on the psychology of complicated families, and her sharp prose never fails to hit the nail on the head. The Goldfinch comes to mind as a readalike – not least because of the significance of a piece of art: the cover depicts a painting made of Maeve when she was 10 – as well as Nick Hornby’s How to Be Good."
128,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1076079-karen,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5 starsThis is another of Patchett's books where you simply go along with the flow and gradually become deeply involved with the wonderful characters and their histories. Some may question what was the point of it, but like other Patchett books, she tells her story and you take from it what you will. Maybe it's about family connections, complications of divorce and step-parenting, or maybe it's about kindness and forgiveness. This one was entertaining, and I felt the house itself that lends its name to the title was not the main character, yet very much a part of it all. Certainly the straw that broke the camel's back, so to speak, in more than a few ways. I appreciated the relationship of Danny and his sister Maeve after their mother leaves them and their father remarries the wicked stepmother. It should give one incentive to have a will in place to protect the children of such a marriage, yet even that may not be enough. Thoughts on the audio version:Well, it was as if the male character Danny was written expressly for Tom Hanks to perform, that Ann Patchett had Hanks in mind the whole time. Sardonic reads sardonic well. Hanks does a super job with the story and added so much to my enjoyment of it. BTW, I understand that Tom and his wife Rita are friends of Ann.A couple of complaints, though. First he didn't even try to change his voice one iota to distinguish the guys from the girls, the men from the women. Everyone sounded the same... like Tom Hanks. It was confusing a few times, but really, not bad. Second, why do comedians have to try to make reading ""Part II, Chapter 8"" into something cute or funny? Ellen Degeneris did it in her Seriously book, and I hated it. Just read the frigging words already. Minor distractions, though. He did an awesome job with an awesome character. And... the fact that there was a Maeve and a May in the book does not work well in audio!"
129,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7481492-margitte,Rating 3 out of 5,"This novel is about a house and it's grandeur. The majestic old mansions was the product of the aesthetical work of the people who commissioned, built and turned it into a family home for people who cold afford the skilled work of masters at work.The original owners cherished it. The second owner, Cyril Conroy, a long-hours, extremely hard-working builder and developer himself, appreciated the house when he bought it, and wished for his family to live there happily ever after. However, it did not turn out that way. Somewhere along the way, greed, tragedy and disloyalty crept in and for over several generations the old mansions would watch them struggle with themselves and their feelings towards Cyril Conroy's legacy and the part they all played in their own destinies. I won't describe it as a modern fairytale at all. Nobody really lived happily ever after, despite the effort to write a villainous stepmother into the tale. Oh wait, no, it really might be the case. In postmodern idiom, everything is rewritten, and in this case being 'modern' and all, there dare not be a prince who rescues the princess and gallop away into the sunset. Nope, romance is frowned upon.Two dogs fight for a bone, and a third runs away with it: would you call that a modern fairytale? I would.WHY A LOWER RATING:I did not feel comfortable with the underlying plot winding through the story line. But overall I enjoyed this family saga up till the end of the second part. The third part: was it really necessary? It did not convince me of anything. In fact, I lost interest, scroll-read through it. Predictable. Boring. That's just me. Don't fret.Nevertheless, it is a wildly successful novel, one rating won't matter. It was written for another audience. And this author is really really good at her craft. "

132,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39878874-laura,Rating 1 out of 5,"This is the most BORING book I have ever read. And I'll happily read books that are just like ""British people visiting eachother and being polite"" for 600 pages. I especially love family epics with no plot. You'd think this would be perfect for me, but no. This was only 300odd pages and it was agonizing to get thru each page bc I did not give a fuck about a single character. I read this because my mom's neighbor gave it to us from the library, which meant I was on a deadline bc I don't want it to be late on her account. That lead to the feeling of school assignment which probably made me enjoy this less. She said the waiting list was over a thousand people long which is why she let us sneak it in before returning. I can't fathom why it's so popular! I don't really get the ann patchett hype but I'm by no means a hater. Bel Canto was fine, albeit overhyped. I remember enjoying Commonwealth even though my review is totally incomprehensible and I seem to have been having a mental breakdown while reading it. This on the other hand, was just unbelievably dull. the inside cover says ""t is filled with suspense"" BITCH WHERE! what suspense! ""Danny and Maeve will stay with you a long time"" the two most boring characters ever??????? I don't think so!!!! The dad was so boring. His only personality was buying out buildings in poor neighborhoods. Which like, whatever, I don't moralize too much about characters. I mean who doesn't like reading about immoral rich people antics. But this doesn't even have salaciousness or cruelty. The dad, and almost everyone else, was aggressively practical.  The housekeeper/cook/nanny were super nice but pretty much indistinguishable. Andrea was simply an evil stepmom with no complication, and I couldn't buy that her infatuation with the house was enough to convince the dad to marry her! The Med school trust fund scheme was dumb, because why waste a decade of life just as a fuck you that you don't even care about! And it definitely did not hurt Andrea & co financially! They waited too long to have any meaningful confrontation. Sure you can interpret their eventual meeting as ""old age robs us all! Time is its own revenge!"" but that was just so unsatisfying. The Evil Stepmom and the Bio mom's abandonment were the two confrontations/mysteries I'm waiting for the whole book and they were BOTH non starters. BOTH!!!!! Give us at least one! The narrator was the most boring and emotionless person of all. He was so boring that he dedicates a paragraph to talking about how much he likes the game monopoly, which is famous for being the most boring and greedy game ever! How apt. His kids were just place fillers. His wife was--you guessed it-- BORING! Her beef with Maeve was flimsy, idk I feel like in-law tension esp jealousy over close sibling relationships is super common and it was not explored in an interesting way. I know this is just a product of the times in which this book is set, but it was annoying how all the women's lives revolved around taking care of Danny, who was not even that appreciative or aware. I also can't get over the fact that his ONLY PASSION IN LIFE was buying out FORECLOSED BUILDINGS in Harlem. Then the whole Mother Abandonment. I have read a few books lately that have that plot element, and all of them answered my questions satisfactorily about why they left and why they didn't/couldn't try to contact their child later in life (Crawdads sing, Cutting for Stone). I know people leave their kids all the time and this happens in real life, but this was literally the dumbest reason. She felt so guilty about living in a big house she wanted to save the poor in India? Why wouldn't she leverage the considerable wealth she had access to via her husband and make a way bigger material impact rather than just being self serving? Swing Time by Zadie Smith does a MUCH better job of exploring the nuances of a parent-child relationship where the parent cares deeply about improving society at the expense of her family life. She fuckin left completely and then not even ONCE over 50 years try to contact them?? wtf??? and then the reunion was just so anticlimactic!! And don't even get me started on the fact that she starts being Evil Andrea's caretaker! The disrespect.Seriously what am I missing here that everyone loves. I guess I'll find out when I read the reviews. I liked the descriptions of the house, which were so much more vivid than any of the humans living in it. But as much as I enjoyed the sense of place the house had, I still could not muster up a fuck to give about Danny and Maeve's and everyone else's obsession with it. I also liked that the cover was the exact painting in the story, bc I hate when book covers have absolutely nothing to do with the content. Anyway yea I was bored to tears by the characters relationships to eachother. Their motivations and reactions were deeply unsatisfying. And if this book was trying to make points on class it was not doing so very well. I'm glad it's over!"

The Dutch House, as it came to be known in Elkins Park and Jenkintown and Glenside and all the way to Philadelphia, referred not to the house's architecture but to its inhabitants. The Dutch House was the place where those Dutch people with the unpronounceable name lived. Seen from certain vantage points of distance, it appeared to float several inches above the hill it sat on. The panes of glass that surrounded the glass front doors were as big as storefront windows and held in place by wrought-iron vines. The windows both took in the sun and reflected it back across the wide lawn. Maybe it was neoclassical, though with with a simplicity in the lines that came closer to Mediterranean or French, and while it was not Dutch, the blue delft mantels in the drawing room, library, and master bedroom were said to have been pried out of a castle in Utrecht and sold to the VanHoebeeks to pay a prince's gambling debts.
When I was a young mother, my parents completed the construction of their dream house, two thousand kilometres away from me and my brothers (and my kids) and they took early retirement and moved away. Over the years and as our families grew, if me and my brothers wanted our parents to know their grandkids, we would need to make the long drive to their home by the lake and thus spend every summer vacation. Inevitably, every year, at some point when everyone's kids had been tucked into their beds, my brothers and I, sitting around the campfire and a few beers in, would start to complain about the kind of parents we had had; let's just say that it wasn't totally surprising for them to have been able to leave us as they did. And one year at the campfire – I don't even remember which one of them said it – one of our spouses griped, “Here we go, the Jones kids unearthing their miserable childhood again.” And that was fair, but we couldn't stop ourselves – I know that for me, everything I had ever felt about our parents had become tied up with that faraway house by the lake and I, year after year, resented being there and it brought up everything long-buried all over again. And so it goes in Ann Patchett's The Dutch House: Having been raised in a uniquely opulent house, siblings Danny and Maeve Conroy so identify the Dutch House with their parents (and their parents' individual relationships with the house) that every time they get together in their hometown the pair inevitably drives to their old neighbourhood and park outside their former home in order to rehash the past and try to figure out the puzzle that was their parents. This is a family drama and a finely observed character study, and although some surprising events do occur, I was mostly surprised by the very human (often conflicting) ways that Patchett has her characters react to these events. I loved every bit of this and will make this review spoiler-free. (Note: I read an ARC and passages quoted may not be in their final forms.)
“Jesus,” Celeste said later when I was trying to tell her the story. “It's like you're Hansel and Gretel. You just keep walking through the dark woods holding hands no matter how old you get. Do you ever get tired of reminiscing?”
The Dutch House is narrated by Danny over the span of fifty years, moving backwards and forwards through time. I liked that this was told only from Danny's POV: as a much younger sibling, he had always been protected by his sister, and maybe it was because he was sheltered or maybe it was because he was a boy, but he had been so incurious about his parents as people when he was growing up that he learns many things late in life and these details become surprising to the reader as well (although they had always been known to Maeve, Danny only needed to ask). In a way, each of the siblings grows up to be like their parents (Maeve big-hearted and charitable like their mother, Danny acquisitive and emotionally walled-off like their dad) even if they don't recognise it, and although Maeve eventually learns to let go of her resentments, Danny nurtures his and refuses to forgive (and again, it's interesting to wonder whether that's because of his sheltered upbringing or intrinsic to his nature). 
We overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we're not seeing it as the people we were, we're seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered. 
Much that's magical about this book lies in the nature of memory and knowing and acceptance. Many parts made me smile and a couple of parts brought me to tears; I recognised myself in these pages and I enjoyed the whole thing."
134,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7115890-constantine,Rating 4 out of 5,"Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐Genre: Literary Fiction + Historical FictionAs the title suggests, this is the story of the residents of the Dutch House. A father and his two children are living in this house. After his wife left him and his two children, Cyril marries Andrea. This stepmother kicks both Danny and Maeve out of the house when their father passes away. The story is about these two siblings and how they survive life’s difficulties. It spans around five decades and is told from Danny’s perspective. I’m always fond of stories that revolve around dysfunctional families. Although the dysfunctionality, in this case, was not too obvious it still was appealing enough for my taste. I think the author did a great job with the characters. They are varied and have their own personality. The relationships between these characters are well thought out. The fascinating thing is that the Dutch House itself plays like a subtle character in the background along with all the human characters.This is the first book I read by Ann Patchett and I’m genuinely pleased by her writing and storytelling techniques. However, I don’t feel this book will be a cup of tea for everybody. I consider myself as one of the target readers for whom this book was written. The story is complex and thought-provoking which makes it captivating. I will be looking forward to reading more of Patchett’s work in the future. "

It is a readable and sometimes moving family story, and is beautifully crafted. So why didn't I give it five stars? Perhaps because for me it is just a little too polished, and a little too predictable, and I am not a huge fan of books in which all of the loose ends are tied up. These are minor criticisms, as I enjoyed reading it."
137,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18695911-daniel-chaikin,Rating 5 out of 5,"I find this one a tough book to review because while there is a plot and one some people will find of interest, it hardly captures what this book really is. It's a novel about place, a house in all its history and architectural oddity, and one bitterly stolen too. And a book about a life, a younger brother telling his own life, growing up without his mother and losing his father to a heart attack, but really he is writing about his older sister. It's, in a way, a love letter to that strong-willed sister who somehow filled-in as a mother figure. This is a nice story, but it's not what makes this book so special to me. But how to capture what does?This is my fourth Patchett book, 3rd novel and I've learned to appreciate her effortless clean prose that carries a story largely by filling in all the stuff that isn't happening with some self-driven thought space and with atmosphere. Here it feels like someone on role, it's a very natural feeling book. As best I can see it, Patchett has captured a pacing, one that takes its time, builds room for space and time, that can bring that reader into that moment without any need to carry on. She brings in some detail that would grab my attention...not my interest exactly, but my attention, I'm listening and I'm wanting to know more about then, and there. And then within that set-up our narrator, Danny, tells his bittersweet story of a normal life with some striking odd scars, like a missing mother and a lost house, one he and his sister miss so much that they spend time together in a car on the curb outside the house they don't live in or own. There is another element here of the author of The Patron Saint of Liars (a book i haven't read). Patchett seems to thinking hard about sainthood, as in the Catholic tradition, or really all traditions. Danny, and his sister Maeve have a living mother they don't know, and they keep being told she is a saint. How can a saint leave their family? But, flipping through the imaginary pages of history, what saint hasn't abandoned their family? It's a curious thing that comes in the novel as a late addition that makes you realize afterward it was there, as a theme, throughout the entirety of the novel. Sainthood, self-sacrifice, selfish sacrifice. Does selflessness always come with a self-interest? And it makes for some interesting comparisons and contrasts, especially between mother and daughter - the daughter whose life defines the book that maybe isn't about a house.Anyway, that last paragraph is idle thought. I enjoyed this book a great deal because of the storytelling and how I was always involved and because of how much I looked forward to listening to more of it. And it doesn't hurt that Tom Hanks reads on audio, and becomes over the course of the book the only voice Danny could possibly have. I do recommend this one to anyone interested. -----------------------------------------------27.

Слушах автобиографична книга на авторката (прочетена от самата нея) и историята за трудния и професионален път, докато дойде времето, в което труда и да бъде признат страшно ме заинтригува и от там се породи интереса ми към книгата. Пробвах се да я слушам в storytel и колкото и възхитително да четеше Том Ханкс, на 5тата минута знаех, че това е книга, която искам да изживея четейки я. Определено мога да кажа, че си струваше чакането! Книгата е великолепна и ме впечатли изключително много. Сигурна съм, че ще е сред любимите ми книги за 2021 и не само.Семейна сага от най-любимите ми - сложни психологически взаимоотношения между родители и деца и брат и сестра. В центъра на историята са Дани и Мейв, които живеят във внушителната Холандска къща близо до Филаделфия. Загубата на майка им като деца, вторият брак на баща им и прогонването им от дома им от “мащехата” им завинаги белязва живота им. Повече няма да разказвам, защото без да искам ще има много спойлери.Най-уникалното за мен в книгата е психологическата, дълбока свързаност между Дани и Мейв и образа на Холандската Къща, която е цял един герой в историята. Както и образа и ролята на майка им. Оставям един цитат, който ме накара да настръхна:“Бяхме превърнали нещастието си във фетиш, бяхме се влюбили в него. Гадеше ми се, защото си дадох сметка колко дълго сме поддържали това си състояние, а не защото сме решили да сложим край.”"

143,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15265939-lynn,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5 stars.I’m not sure where to begin with this book. It is so complex on many levels. Told from Danny Conroy’s POV, it is the story about how the acquisition, and eventual loss of the mansion known as The Dutch House, has a disastrous effect on the Conroy family. Purchased by his father Cyril as a surprise for his mother Elna, the house becomes a fixture and fixation in all their lives. Elna can’t stand living there, and eventually leaves her husband and two children, including Danny’s older sister Maeve, and disappears from their lives. Cyril, an emotionally closed off father, eventually remarries a woman, Andrea, who only cares about the house, and nothing and no one else. After Cyril’s untimely death, Andrea banishes Danny and Maeve from the house. Maeve takes it upon herself to make sure Danny gets a good start in life, while trying to screw over Andrea. At times, Maeve and Danny park outside the house and ruminate on their lives, trying to make sense of it all. For most of their adult lives, it’s Maeve and Danny against the world. Even Danny’s wife, Celeste, cannot infiltrate their bond, much to her frustration. Eventually secrets are revealed, pasts are reconciled and forgiveness is offered and accepted. This story takes place over 50 years, with some characters giving the backstory which explains the present. The story sometimes jumps around in time, but the reader generally knows where they are in the story. The characters are wonderfully portrayed, although not all are likable. Danny and Maeve are totally human and are shown for who they truly are, warts and all. Danny doesn’t realize how much like his father he is as a person, although he is a better father to his kids than his father was to him and Maeve. Maeve is a joy to read. She never pulls any punches with anyone. I have to say I really disliked Andrea, who is almost too easy to hate, and Celeste, who had one expectation of her life and became bitter when it didn’t happen as she wanted. Frankly, I couldn’t understand why Danny married her, other than it seemed convenient at the time. I never got the impression that they really loved each other. Fluffy, Jocelyn and Sandy remind me of the three fairy godmothers in Cinderella, always showing up at the right times and waving their magic wands to try to make things right. The story explores the themes of forgiveness, obsession, family love, self sufficiency and self actualization. Both Danny and Elna had to be true to themselves in order to live their lives. Both were also quite self absorbed, seldom seeing beyond their own needs. Maeve’s only purpose in life seemed to be to help Danny, although she did find her own niche and was seemingly happy. I sometimes wondered about her relationship with her boss, if maybe there was more there than Danny knew. The book is beautifully written and flows along almost seamlessly. Mostly it is well paced, although the last section seemed to be a bit rushed. But overall, this is a great read that I could not put down. A definite recommend. "
144,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7912849-kerrin,Rating 4 out of 5,"This was a very complex, interesting saga about a sister and brother, Maeve and Danny Conroy. Danny is the narrator. (Everyone who has listened to Tom Hanks read the Audible version rants how wonderful he is as Danny.) When Maeve was a little girl, their father Cyril bought a mansion known as the Dutch House. Their mother, Elna, who had wanted to become a nun, never felt comfortable in the house. When Danny was a small child, Elna abandoned the family and went off to “be a saint” by helping the poor.Soon thereafter, Maeve becomes a Type I diabetic. The children are cared for by the household staff after their mother disappears. Cyril later marries Andrea, a truly horrible woman, with two young daughters. Cyril shared his love of real estate and owning buildings with Danny. Cyril dies unexpectedly while Danny is only a Sophmore in high school. Andrea kicks him out of the house and demands that Maeve, who recently graduated from college, become his caregiver.Danny’s devotion to Maeve is very deep throughout the novel. For example, Danny wants to follow in Cyril’s footsteps and become a real estate maven, but he goes to medical school just to please her. Maeve never marries, and never seems to fully live up to her potential.For many years, Maeve and Danny would park across the street from The Dutch House and have meaningful discussions. When they are much older, they realize they “had made a fetish out of [their] misfortune, fallen in love with it.” They both had a powerful attachment to painful experiences and relationships of their childhood. It was more difficult for Danny to be “dislodged from suffering” and become unstuck from the past than it was for Maeve. When it came to forgiving their mother, Danny only did so to make Maeve happy.My biggest complaint about this book was the lack of continuity in the timeline. Danny could be talking about his two children, then next about when he was dating his wife, followed by coming home from boarding school in high school. While many others have praised Ann Patchett for being able to craft together a jigsaw puzzle, I found the style a little annoying. For that reason, I rate it 4-Stars."
145,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1903072-peter,Rating 3 out of 5,"Cyril Conroy, a real estate developer, secretly purchases a striking three-storey mansion on the outskirts of Philadelphia. When he presents it to his wife Elna, she is appalled by its opulence. It gets to a point where she can't stand to live there any longer and she runs away to help the poor, leaving 10 year-old Maeve and toddler Danny behind. Some time after, Cyril marries a woman named Andrea, who already has two young daughters. Andrea's arrival brings major upheaval to the Conroy household. The story is narrated by Danny years later, looking back on a time when he and his sister had their lives upended, reminiscing about the ways he and Maeve coped with their misfortune.This is my first time reading Ann Patchett and I can see why she has so many admirers. She is clearly a keen observer of human nature. Her writing style is unhurried, always in complete control. My one complaint here is that not all the characters are fully developed - Andrea in particular felt like a two-dimensional villain. But I suppose that can happen when you use a first-person narrative - it's Danny's version of events that we are told. I liked how the story explored how a person can become preoccupied with the past. And I was moved by the sibling bond between Maeve and Danny, the sacrifices they made for one another, the heartbreak they shared that drove them closer together. An absorbing and poignant family drama."
146,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50297885-joy-d,Rating 4 out of 5,"“We had made a fetish out of our misfortune, fallen in love with it.” ― Ann Patchett, The Dutch HouseQuiet character-driven novel about siblings Maeve and Danny Conroy, whose mother left home when they were children. Set in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania, their father is reserved, and their stepmother despises them. They go through rough times, experiencing the ups and downs of life over the course of fifty years. They rely heavily on each other. They constantly revisit their past, repeating destructive patterns, making it difficult to live a fulfilled life. The story is told from Danny’s adult perspective. It explores the childhood trauma of abandonment, how memories get tangled over time, and how acting on a sense of obligation or duty can change a life. There is a subplot related to materialism. Some characters chase money or status, and these are contrasted against altruism and a desire to minister to the poor. The writing is elegant. The characters feel authentic. The house is a recurring image throughout the book. I listened to the audio book, read by Tom Hanks. He is a fantastic reader. His phrasing patterns are unique, and it flows well. I am rapidly becoming a fan of Ann Patchett. This is the third of her novels I have read – the others are Bel Canto and State of Wonder. I very much enjoyed all three. "

There are so many brilliant 5 stars.Unfortunately, although beautifully written, I did not feel engaged.It started very promising, but the plotless storyline dragged for too long.I don’t mind a plotless story, as long as the characters are giving me back something.I found that the characters were all too passive, flat and unreal. Even some situations sounded unrealistic.I also did not like the timeline structure. Oh, wait, there is no timeline. In one paragraph you are all of sudden married and with two kids, next paragraph you are back to your younger age and trying to figure out what you want in life; in another paragraph you are destitute and on the following you are buying properties.I found the whole book uninteresting and boring.I even tried listening to the audiobook as I read, and Tom Hanks, as a narrator, did not help to hold my interest.I love a good family drama where there are no forgiveness.I really did not care for any of the characters.This book was too bloodless.It left me cold.Oh, yes, this book is considered as a modern fairy tale.

153,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83419690,Rating 5 out of 5,"Ann Patchett is one of those few. who can bring banal everyday life to the meta-level. He draws the heavy dark water from the wells of the collective unconscious, after drinking it, everyone becomes a part of history himself, and brings a piece of himself into it. What has entered into flesh and blood is already your pain and joy forever. However, this immersion is far from pathos and seems to be intentionally devoid of clear links to the political situation of ""the fate of the family in the fate of the country"", previously mandatory for the genre of family saga. Patchett's stories remain private, even with the case of the extremely social ""Bel Canto"".""Dutch House"" is about the nouveau riche who moved into a beautiful three-story house bought by his father with all possessions. The story is about how the mother did not like this mansion and left it, and the second wife drove the children out of there. About how the fates of the brother and sister developed further, how, without being dazzlingly lucky and cloudlessly happy, both managed to live their lives with dignity and in harmony with the world. And the evil stepmother lived her life with less dignity, but surrounded by beautiful expensive things in the palace, which, unlike the mother of the heroes, she loved immediately and for life. More of a spouse, more of her own daughters and her immortal soul.Потерянный рай или Дом, где разбиваются сердца?Мне казалось, что дом - огромная раковина, которую я обречен таскать на себе всю жизнь.Энн Пэтчетт из тех немногих. кто может вывести банальную повседневность на метауровень. Черпает тяжелую темную воду колодцев коллективного бессознательного, испив которой, всякий становится частью истории сам, и вносит в нее частичку себя. Что вошло в плоть и кровь, то уже навеки твоя боль и радость. Однако, погружение это далеко от пафоса и словно бы намерено лишено четких привязок к политической ситуации ""судьбы семьи в судьбе страны"", прежде обязательной для жанра семейной саги. Истории Пэтчетт остаются частными, даже с случае предельно социального ""Бельканто"".""Голландский дом"" о нуворишах, вселившихся в прекрасный трехэтажный дом, купленный отцом со всем имуществом. История о том, как мать не полюбила этот особняк и ушла из него, а вторая жена выгнала оттуда детей. О том, как складывались судьбы брата и сестры дальше, как, не будучи ослепительно удачливыми и безоблачно счастливыми, оба сумели прожить свою жизнь достойно и в гармонии с миром. А злая мачеха прожила свою менее достойно, но в окружении прекрасных дорогих вещей во дворце, который, в отличие от мамы героев, полюбила сразу и на всю жизнь. Больше супруга, больше собственных дочерей и своей бессмертной души.Ну какая же это банальность: жена уходит от богатого любимого мужа, оставив десятилетнюю дочь и четырехлетнего сына. Не к любовнику, заметьте, а вообще непонятно почему. Отец женится снова на красавице с двумя дочерьми, младше наших героев. Мачеха понемногу прибирает к рукам все в доме, оттесняя родных детей от жизненных благ, а после смерти мужа и вовсе выгоняет их из дома. Много вы такого видали? А то нет? Половина сказок об этом, ""Крошечка-Хаврошечка"", ""Золушка"", ""О мертвой царевне и семи богатырях"", ""Гензель и Гретель"". Мамы в них не уходят, а умирают, а так все то же.Дальше: сестра отдает все силы на то, чтобы спасти брата - ""Гуси-лебеди"", ""Снежная Королева"". Забота о его образовании остается за рамками большинства сказок, в пользу принцев-изгнанников, как правило, не учреждают образовательных фондов. Ну так ведь и у нас не сказка, а реальная жизнь, в которой фонд играет ту самую роль, какую добрая коровушка или фея-крестная - то, что позволяет не сгинуть в самом начале, хотя дальнейшее зависит только от тебя. Даже сказочные условия, вроде ""никто не должен знать"" и ""вернуться до полуночи"" соблюдены. В нашем случае, это: ""утратишь право пользоваться, если успеваемость снизится до троек"".Жесткое условия. Особенно когда чувствуешь призвание не к медицине, которая даст самую престижную из профессий, а к куда менее почтенным с��екуляциям недвижимостью, для которых учиться не нужно. Но разве у мамы не та же самая история? Она тоже всего-то и хотела, что помогать бедным, вместо того, чтобы жить не своей жизнью в этом барском доме. ""Голландский дом"" - это еще и о том, как мы проецируем свое понятие счастья на других, как искренне дивимся, отчего лучшая, в нашем понимании, доля, которую дарим ближним, воспринимается веригами и кандаламы.И о том, как по-разному подходим к принятию судьбоносных решений, с какой готовностью порой приносим в жертву ближних ради дальних. И о том, как наступать на горло собственной песне, как выдерживать годы занятий нелюбимым и не своим делом. Как честно отработанная карма позволяет наконец обрести счастье со своим и любимым.Энн Пэтчетт, безусловно, мастер, у которого a финальные прощения-примирения не выглядят патокой (ну, почти не выглядят). А ""Голландский дом"" одна из лучших переводных книг 2021 в российском книжном пространстве."
154,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/115229580-justin-chen,Rating 5 out of 5,"5 starsA solid 4 stars story with an added star for Tom Hanks' vibrant narration, which really should be the definitive way to consume The Dutch House. This is a sentimental story masterfully told: a cross-generational tale revolving around a brother and sister, their decades long relationship with each other, as well as their strange obsession for their childhood home. Ann Patchett managed to weave a complex familial drama without swerving into sappy generic territory, instead focusing on deconstructing the lifelong implication of reckless, in-the-moment decisions, with a flair for levity and sarcasm.The nonlinear structure is a surprising choice for a story that's typically told either chronologically, or through a series of flashbacks. The added complexity definitely enhances the overall experience, like a half-finished puzzle, the reader gets to experience alongside its characters, overlaying the past with the present, and decipher how their previous decisions impact the future. The Dutch House is a novel of typical length, yet emotionally it feels like an epic, due to its extended timeline (covering at least 50+ years) as well as the frank depiction of the protagonist's family dynamics. Filled with observational charm, The Dutch House elegantly captures the lasting effect of one's upbringing; this is an easy recommendation."
155,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34980639-april,Rating 1 out of 5,"I feel like this book will likely be lauded as ""good literature"". It will likely be something that people who read really important books will talk about for the next few years. But, it was not a book I enjoyed. I heard Ann Patchett speak over the summer, and she mentioned that Tom Hanks would be narrating this audiobook. Since, I love Tom Hanks, I decided to give it a listen, even though I also received a free ARC of the book during Ann's talk. Not even Tom Hanks could save my interest in this book. I kept listening really hoping at some point I would begin to enjoy it, but I never did. The book skips around a lot, and that didn't translate well to audio. I was confused as to when certain things were taking place. I assume I am supposed to cheer for Danny and Maeve, because they are abandoned by their mother and then kicked out of their home by their stepmother when their father dies, but I don't. I don't care about them, or their obsession with the house they grew up in. I just don't get the appeal of this book. This was the first book of Patchett's I've read, and I am definitely not inspired to read anymore. However, I will say that hearing her speak was fantastic. She's witty and charming. Too bad she doesn't write that way."

I started listening to it without knowing he was going to be the narrator and as it went on the voice sounded so familiar, so likeable, then I realized it was him and he did such a great job, it really took the book to the next level of greatness.This novel is not so much about the story as it is about the characters, and the house, which is a character in itself. The Dutch House had a magnetic pull on the characters and and the descriptions of it were were vivid and detailed. Overall, it was a delight to read.Loved it and recommend it!"

Though this was not what I was expecting, I did find myself thinking about it. This is at its heart a family drama that revolves around a house. Honestly, the house was a more interesting character than either Danny or Mauve. I kind of wish the POV had alternated between them both instead of only Danny. Think it would’ve added an interesting perspective and more depth to the story. I listened to this and realized it was being narrated by Tom Hanks. Wasn’t sure how I’d like him but he slowly grew on me. I spend it up a bit from my usual 1.25 up to 1.35. In the end, this novel struck a cord in me and for this reason the added star is deserved."
160,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14389832-mary-lins,Rating 5 out of 5,"I read Ann Patchett’s “Patron Saint of Liars”, when it came out almost 30 years ago and loved it so much that I wrote Ms. Patchett a letter praising it, and she wrote me a lovely note back. I became a fan for life, reading every one of her marvelous (and unique!) novels. So yes, I was primed to love “The Dutch House”, and I did! Not just because it’s my habit to rave about Patchett’s novels, but because it’s GREAT; it’s my new favorite!“The Dutch House”, (itself as much a character as any of the humans in the novel) is in a suburb of Philadelphia. Just after WWII, Cyril Conroy buys the palatial mansion – fully and sumptuously furnished – for his wife Elna and it is where Danny and Maeve Conroy grew up. Danny is our first-person narrator and he and Maeve are a modern day Hansel and Gretel, complete with abandonment, banishment and a wicked step-mother. They even have three Fairy Godmothers: Fluffy, Sandy, and Jocelyn. “The Dutch House” is the story of a “modern family”, as this was the era when families started to become fractured and step-parents and step-siblings became more prevalent. Some of these themes Patchett explored beautifully in “Commonwealth”, and she knows whereof she speaks because she’s written essays about her own large, extended, loosely related-by-a-string, family. I was absorbed from page one, and I hated to turn the last page. What makes Patchett so accessible and relevant is her beautiful writing, her wit, and the fascinating stories she spins out of every-day life. At the most surprising, dramatic, and climactic scene in the novel Danny narrates: “I had not been born with an imagination large enough to encompass this moment.” Well, Ann Patchett was born with an imagination large enough – thank heavens! What a magnificent story!"
161,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8530205-marty-fried,Rating 4 out of 5,"Tom Hanks seemed perfect for narrating this book. His voice made it easier to keep going when the going got slow, which it did off and on. While it won't win any awards for action and intrigue, like going to school, it does award the reader for being there and paying attention.It was occasionally hard to follow because it suddenly skipped around in time, but not for long. Perhaps that was just a way to make us pay attention, by jolting us awake now and then.Some of the lessons I learned were family is important so don't shut any of them out, and don't hold a grudge and try to get even with someone who you don't really even know. Even though their mother abandoned them when they were young, I think she deserves forgiveness more than the father, who didn't really seem to care about his children very much. And the evil stepmother probably didn't deserve to be hated, especially to the point of abandoning her children as part of the family, or as friends. They were victims as much as anyone.Personally, I liked the father least, but he tried to do what he thought was good. Unfortunately, the house seemed to have evil intent or something. It was too strong for its occupants, and perhaps their mother sensed it more than others. It certainly seemed to have a bad influence on many lives.All in all, a very good book, but a little slow for me at this time, hence the 4 stars."

A história foi muito bem escrita e a autora demonstra uma facilidade muito grande em transitar entre as cinco décadas de vida desses personagens.

Estive, o tempo inteiro, muito interessado em tudo que acontecia na vida desses personagens e onde a autora levaria eles ao longo dessas cinco décadas. Esse é mais um livro que vai discutir família e dinâmica familiar e, pra ser honesto, é muito difícil eu não gostar de um livro que propõe essa discussão, que mostra as diversas facetas de uma família e que mostra como a família tem o poder de moldar um indivíduo pra sempre. Com isso, a narrativa explora a história daqueles que escolheram o passado como presente, daqueles que não conseguem seguir em frente e viver sua vida, propondo, indiretamente, uma reflexão sobre o que aconteceria se tudo o que aconteceu na vida daquelas pessoas fosse deixado no passado. O livro foi lindo, inteligente, esclarecedor. Recomendo!Gostaria de fazer uma observação: o audiobook desse livro é muito bom, quem puder ler junto com o audiobook vai ter toda uma experiência."
163,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2228181-jill,Rating 4 out of 5,"According to the book jacket of The Dutch House, the novel is a “dark fairy tale about two smart people who cannot overcome their past.”And indeed, the two main characters – the supremely self-confident and protective older sister Maeve and her younger brother, Danny – are obsessively connected to the lavish estate purchased by their father in the Philadelphia suburbs. Their mother has left them to their own wiles and in her place, a younger wicked stepmother and her own two daughters have moved in with their father. It is only a matter of time until they are exiled. And although they follow different paths, it is only when they come together that they are complete.I had a little trouble tapping into the male voice of Danny at first (for several pages, I thought the first-person narrator was female), but gradually, I accepted his voice because I was caught up in the narrative. Ann Patchett is a natural-born storyteller and here, like in her last book, Commonwealth, she ambitiously traces a family through a couple of generations.Both books center around an action (the exile in Dutch House, an illicit kiss in Commonwealth), and both deal with “blended families” that in reality do not blend. At the time Commonwealth was published, Ann Patchett called it her “autobiographical first novel” and I suspect that some of Dutch House is mined from those same murky areas of childhood – the complications of extended families, the theft of certain memories of childhood, the borders between realities and how we remember.It’s difficult to review the way I want to without spoilers, so I’ll just say this: I also saw parallels to religious parables. In a sense, the Dutch House is Eden – that wonderful paradise of childhood of which teens and young adults are eventually cast out. There is a central character who sets herself up to be a saint with an aberrant desire to be “of help”, and Ann Patchett nails it when she says that saints are generally despised by those who really know them. And, there is a quest for redemption.Although I have quibbles – the male voice, the somewhat rushed ending (along with certain aspects of that ending), I do think this is one of Ann Patchett’s better books. It’s not quite as good as Bel Canto (which, to my mind, is her best) nor is it as unrealistic as State of Wonder (which many readers enjoyed and I did not). It’s definitely worth reading and I give it a 4.5 rating."

That's a high bar ... and (alas), maybe my expectations were too high, but ... given how much I've enjoyed some of her work, I just can't put this one in the same category.But it's classic Patchett. Easy (and a pleasure) to read. Convincing characters that play their roles well. A complex ... and not entirely predictable (and peppered with sufficient twists and turns) ... drama spanning a lifetime ... all packaged nicely with efficient, appropriate, appealing prose. Family ... and relationships ... and love ... and loss and disappointment ... and more than a dollop of bitterness and spite ... and life ... and loyalty ... and expectation ... and, in the end, ultimately, the human condition.I'm somewhat intrigued by Patchett's decision to narrate through a male voice, but ... it worked (at least for me) and made sense, in context, given the way the story played out.I'm pleased I read it (and spent my money on it - Patchett has earned my reading dollars many times over), and I'm glad I got to it relatively quickly before I became biased by others' perspectives. And, in retrospect, if I hadn't read (and loved) so much of her other stuff, I almost certainly would've rated this one 5 stars...."

Dad gets a new young wife and dies very soon. So 2 kids, now students live with their stepmom until she just throws them out as it is her property. That’s basically it.Sister and brother has very codependent relationship and every month sits in the car and watch the house.

It is even mentioned in a book, that they are like Hansel and Gretel.After 30 years mothers appears. With no explanation, nothing. That was the most undeveloped and unreasonable character. No reason for leaving no reason for coming backs and no reason for behaving like she did in the end, which I am not gonna spoil. Everyone gets their punishment in a way.

No twists and turns that keep you up thinking about them but people that you keep thinking about because you feel like you know them. Tom Hanks is the narrator for the audible book (totally recommend) and you truly feel like he is telling his story. You believe this story and the relationship with him and his family especially his sister. You go through loss, anger, shock, grief, forgiveness, love, parenthood and many other emotions with this story but all the while enjoying this, well at least I did. I would absolutely recommend this book to friends but can't give any defining moments, just that when you are done....you will miss them.A re-read for me.

Fixated by the house, they revisit it through the years, and so the past and how it shapes present and future is examined. And later forgiveness, justice and penance.I think the writer is a marvelous storyteller, I went on reading even at times sheer stubbornness being the primary motivator. The sole reason to finish the book being to find out how it all ends. I'm not so sure if I liked the journey or what we find in the end. I think it all comes down to distrust. Life makes it allowances, I admit, but nothing is ever as simple or neat and cleanly cut as the way a lot of things seem here."

But the Dutch House checks all the boxes for what I consider a great book. Characters that you want to hug, slap, or invite over for dinner. Or all of the above. A story about a family and a house that demonstrates how that house can be so much more than a structure. It can represent the bones of the family, a symbol connected to love or loss or achievement or abandonment. And a bringing together of people who were flung away and then return to the fold, for comfort, understanding, closure. What a pleasure to read."

But even with just a few weeks until this glorious day, I could not focus on the scares and frights of the holiday. Instead I could only think about Ann Patchett’s wonderful new novel, The Dutch House. All seasonal thoughts of the macabre and the supernatural disappeared, replaced by ruminations about this heartfelt and beautiful novel. The characters haunted me like ghosts inhabiting a malevolent old manor. The story filled me up like Dr. Frankenstein filled up the head of his monster with the brain of a murderer. The pages flew by like bats, disappearing like a handful of candy corn until I was left with only sticky fingers (and a persistent tooth ache) to remind me of the journey. There were emotional moments in this excellent novel that crept up on me like a salivating werewolf hunting its prey in a pumpkin patch. They left me in tears as if I was a child whose parents ate all their trick-or treating candy and then filmed it to send in to late night TV talk-show host Jimmy Kimble for some cruel and inhumane comedy bit. The conclusion was both pensive and satisfying, not unlike a midnight visit from the Great Pumpkin herself. No, no, no there were definitely zero thoughts of Halloween floating around in my brainpan as I devoured this book, like some kind of Creature from the Black Lagoon. The Dutch House gives us the pairing of Maeve and Danny Conroy. You can add these two siblings to the vast and sweeping pantheon of brother/sister duos that have won the hearts of America. They are like Michael and Janet Jackson if Michael and Janet could neither sing nor dance, or like Warren Beatty and Shirley McClain with 100% less Academy Awards. Think Donny and Marie without the purple socks or Olympian skaters the Shib Sibs if they fell every time they put on ice-skates. The Conroy’s live outside Philadelphia in a large and fancy Netherlandish dwelling. The Conroy children first lose their mother, increasing their bond as older Maeve takes it upon herself to care for her younger brother. Their suffering only increases when a few years later their father dies and they are evicted from their home by their truly awful stepmother. Themes such as the circular paths our lives take (history repeating), forgiveness, and unreliable memories permeate this story like a trick-or-treating bag full of way too many Necco Wafers and Smarties (seriously, folks, what the hell??!). Patchett writes with a sense of compassion that coats her characters like the sweet sweet chocolate that coats a Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup. Patchett has the sense of empathy and sensitivity of someone who lives far north of her Tennessee home. This dazzling book is a must read and it is sure to illuminate your soul like a jack o’lantern stuffed with massive pillar candles. "
174,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/95284601-jetmira,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Dutch House”, (itself as much a character as any of the humans in the novel) is in a suburb of Philadelphia. Just after WWII, Cyril Conroy buys the palatial mansion – fully and sumptuously furnished – for his wife Elna and it is where Danny and Maeve Conroy grew up. Danny is our first-person narrator and he and Maeve are a modern day Hansel and Gretel, complete with abandonment, banishment, and a wicked step-mother. They even have three Fairy Godmothers: Fluffy, Sandy, and Jocelyn.“The Dutch House” is the story of a “modern family”, as this was the era when families started to become fractured and step-parents and step-siblings became more prevalent. Some of these themes Patchett explored beautifully in “Commonwealth”, and she knows whereof she speaks because she’s written essays about her own large, extended, loosely-related-by-a-string, family.I was absorbed from page one, and I hated to turn the last page. What makes Patchett so accessible and relevant is her beautiful writing, her wit, and the fascinating stories she spins out of every-day life.At the most surprising, dramatic, and climactic scene in the novel Danny narrates: “I had not been born with an imagination large enough to encompass this moment.” Well, Ann Patchett was born with an imagination large enough – thank heavens! What a magnificent story!"
175,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5550397-britany,Rating 3 out of 5,"Danny & Maeve are siblings that live in the Dutch House. The house is in main character it itself. They move into the house fully furnished and the items in the house are specific and nuanced, creating a unique reading experience.The story is told from Danny's perspective and goes in and out changing from past to present and jumps around a little bit in the timeline. This took a little while to get used to for me. The Dutch House is a character study of one family, fading in and out and as different life events change the outcome, however the house always maintains a strong sense of place and a sounding board which these characters constantly rotate around. Patchett does such a wonderful job of illustrating lives of normal families and a mini universe into one novel. This one just didn't connect as deeply with me as I had hoped. I never fully believed the story coming from Danny's perspective. I think Patchett attempted something, but it didn't work for me. I never truly cared about these characters and really only found myself interested in Maeve. She was the most interesting and I really wish the novel was from her POV. This is my second Patchett, Commonwealth being my first, and I liked that one much better than this one. I will continue to pick up more by her and while I appreciate her writing, I'm not sure how much I will take with me over the years."

Tom Hanks narrates the audio and does a terrific job! I don’t even know how to explain what this book is about without making it sound uneventful because there really isn’t much to tell. It’s about a house and a family. It’s also kind of about relationships, hurt, pain and forgiveness. I feel like different readers will come away with different meanings and messages depending on one’s own experiences and interpretations. It is a straightforward story with many layers weaved into it. It was simple yet complex. Told through the eyes of a man looking back at his family history and complicated family dynamics growing up in The Dutch House. The writing was warm and inviting. The characters were impeccably developed. A beautiful heartwarming story that will captivate and charm most readers."

But then in the last sections of the book it hit me and I loved it. Danny the narrator is so un observant half the time, or at least he only sees what he wants to see or how it affects him, whereas all the female characters around him seem much more complex and I would’ve loved to hear their voices and their reasons for their actions. Maeve in particular is a wonderful character. Parenting, (especially how we view mothers)the roles of women in society, memories, forgiveness seem to be the main themes to me. The story jumps around a bit in time but was easy to follow."

179,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35482263-gumble-s-yard---golden-reviewer,Rating 4 out of 5,"I read this book due to its longlisting for the 2020 Women’s Prize.The book is narrated in the first person by Danny Conroy. He largely grew up in a household with his property developer Father, his 7 year older sister Maeve and two servants, his mother having left, for India, when he was young. They lived in an ostentatious house in a Pennsylvania town, something she never reconciled herself to, given her altruistic/charitable mindset. The house was originally commissioned by a Dutch family who made a fortune in cigarettes after the First World War. When their family all died out, and the house fell into disrepair looked after by Fiona (the daughter of their driver and cook) before being purchased by Danny’s father shortly after the Second World War (using money he had secretly amassed in some speculative but informed property deals). Danny’s parents took on Fiona as a nurse for Maeve and the soon-to-be-born Danny. Fiona left when Danny was young (not before an affair with their father) after striking and injuring Danny with a spoon one day.The book opens with Danny remembering the day his Father bought home another divorcee – Andrea (to whom Maeve in particular took an immediate dislike), later followed by introducing Andrea’s two children, with marriage and further alienation from Maeve then following. When their father dies of a heart attack, and Andrea is almost the last to know, Danny now 15 and Maeve (working as an accountant in a local frozen vegetable manufacturing firm, a job Danny considers beneath her) realise they have effectively lost both the house and their role in continuing their father’s business (something Danny had set his heart on) – as Andrea had persuaded their father not only to give her joint ownership but also not to write a will – their only provision an educational trust fund for Danny and Andrea’s two children. Danny ends up at boarding school and then expensive medical school, at Maeve’s insistence as a way to spend as much of the fund as possible, his own dreams of property speculation and development deferred.The book, narrated in the first person by Danny, jumps around time (although with a largely forward impetus). Danny marries and his wife Celeste (who largely builds her life around caring for him) and Maeve grow to dislike each other over time – so that he effectively meets them both separately, although there is a warmer relationship (and physical relationship) between Maeve and his daughter (an ambitious dancer turned singer turned actress).Maeve remains obsessed with her hatred and resentment of Andrea – and frequently, over many years, she and Danny wait in a car looking at the house – in fact much of their relationship is forged during those times, as Danny finally realises (many many years after Celeste and around 250 pages after the reader) “We had made a fetish out of our misfortunes, fallen in love with it”.
“Like swallows, like salmon, we were the helpless captives of our migratory patterns. We pretended that what we had lost was the house, not our mother, not our father. We pretended that what we had lost had been taken from us by the person who still lived inside”
Although narrated by Danny and (in its final incarnation) named after the house, the book is really about neither. The real key character at the centre of the book is Maeve (and I believe that was the author’s preferred title, “The Dutch House” being picked more for commercial reasons, that the author, as a bookshop owner, could appreciate). It makes sense that a picture of Maeve, which is important to the book, is on the front cover, rather than the house. The author has also said that this was deliberate (and the description of the house in the book is left limited) as the author really wants readers to think of a house that they have seen.Maeve herself is a complex character. A life-long sufferer from diabetes, but with a partly reckless attitude to her own health. Having to witness her mother leaving home (without perhaps ever really understanding why at the time). Her own attempts to stand on her own two feet (by forging her own career rather than taking money from her father) are simply ignored by him (he is too busy involving Danny in his business). Her father’s relationship with Andrea is just for her another rejection. She never comes to terms either with Andrea being worth to marry her father (something Andrea’s behaviour hardly disabuses her of) and then later that Celeste is worth to marry Danny – someone whose life until then she had effectively used as a petty instrument of her own revenge. She also becomes obsessed with her own loss of the house. We do see some hope in her life though – a strong series of hints that perhaps she had a hidden lover for many years. Themes include:-	Fairytales – with of course a wicked stepmother, a magical but cursed house and two siblings. There are links also to “Nutcracker” and “Turn of the Screw” which both feature in the narrative.
It’s like you’re Hansel and Gretel. You just keep walking through the dark woods holding hands no matter how old you get. Do you ever get tired of reminsicing?
-	Self-centredness – particularly of men Danny is someone who spends most of his time reflecting on the irrationality and selfishness of the women around him (his mother who he does not remember but cannot forgive for her desertion; his sister and wife who thinks are both unfair on the other leaving him to pick up the pieces) while seemingly unaware they (and others like the ex-Dutch house servants) are largely doing nothing other than supporting him.-	The unreliability of memory, and particularly competing versions of family memory, some of which simply comes from different ages and experiences. Maeve still loves her mother’s memory but hates Andrea; Danny resents the first and is more indifferent to the second.
Do you think it’s ever possible to see the past as it actually was …….we overlay the present on to the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered
-	The superficiality of an obsession with wealth, particularly property wealth. Ann Patchett has said the book was partly inspired by how this idea seemed to dominate the last presidential election – a candidate should be elected simply because he had more (property) wealth. -	Sainthood/altruism – and what affect a rejection of riches and embrace of poverty relief has on your family – and why that is considered acceptable for a man but not a woman, and particularly not a motherAs the book gets closer to a conclusion, relationships long buried or conducted at a distance suddenly are forced into resolution (particularly Maeve/Danny with Andrea, Andrea’s children, Fiona and their own mother) or in the case of one relationship (Maeve and her lover of many years) revealed to us (although oddly it seems not to Danny). The ending of the book I initially found difficult – some people have called it a little twee or a surprise happy resolution, for me it was a continuation of a family tragedy – and obsession with property over people.Overall an extremely competently written and thoughtful book – if not one where I really empathised with any of the characters (which is always a limitation"

Dabar pagalvojęs, sakyčiau, kad stokojome vaizduotės.“5/5Magiška knyga, savo pasakiškumu primenanti geriausius vaikystės kūrinius, bet santykių sudėtingumu ir kompleksiškumu, gyvenimo tėkmės įvairialypiškumu galinti pretenduoti į Pulitzerio aukštumas. Nė akimirkai ne politiška, kuo dažnai ši premija kaltinama, bet tiesiog gyvenimiška. Buvau girdėjusi nuomonių apie siužetinius posūkius, kuriais kiti skaitytojai nepatikėjo, bet širdimi išjaučiau kiekvieną: motinos išėjimą, tėvo patriarchalinę tylą, pamotės pyktį ir žiaurumą, namo žmogiškumą, brolio ir sesers meilės pasakiškumą. Dar autorei nespėjus to paminėti, jau romanas suskambėjo ir kaip „Mažoji princesė“, ir kaip „Jonukas ir Grytutė“, tačiau čia nėra nė lašo infantilumo, o tarp skausmo – labai daug grožio. Veikėjai tikri iki menkiausios veido išraiškos, o tikriausias pats namas, valdantis visus ir kiekvieną, apsėdantis taip, kaip Shirley Jackson Hill House galėtų tik pavydėti. Galima būtų sakyti, kad moterys romane sudaiktintos, tačiau įsižiūrėjus akivaizdu, kad susidaiktino tik tos, kurios nė akimirkai nežiūrėjo į ateitį, negaudė jau pradėjusio pūsti feministinio vėjo – net jei jautė jo gūsius, dažnas pasiekdavo nebent iš literatūros, ne iš tikro gyvenimo. O gi paprasta, praktiška moteris žino geriau, nei tikėti knygomis – jose per dažnai būna „ilgai ir laimingai“, kad taip lengvai pasiduotum – ar bent akimirkai gali jas kaltinti? Nors čia moterys gana aiškiai pasiskirsto vaidmenimis, net ir menkiausi veikėjai yra įvairialypiai – negalima jų guldyti į vieną konkrečią lentyną. Tėvo veikėjas, toks tylus, veiksmais kalba tiek daug, o jo istorija nepaliauja vyniotis už siūlo galo net po to, kai jo paties jau daug metų nebėra gyvo – tai tik dar kartą įrodo autorės istorijų pasakojimo talentą. Vietomis iki skausmo norisi kiekvieną purtyti – tai dėl vienos priežasties, tai dėl kitos, tačiau kaip ir gyvenime – lengviausia paleisti gyventi. Romanas pasakojimo lengvumu ir teksto plaukimu skaitosi kur kas lengviau nei autorės „Vieningieji“ ar net „Nuostaba“, tačiau tai gali būti ir nuostabiosios vertėjos G.G.-Bernotienės nuopelnas – jos rankose Patchett tekstas sužiba papildoma magija, o Olandų namo auksai įgauna tokį gylį, kad gniaužia kvapą.

I am so very grateful to have been able to escape into a brilliant novel these past few days as reality has been too much to bear.I think what I appreciate most about Patchett is her surgical precision in cutting into family dynamics. It’s the pervading theme of most of her novels and yet her approach, her characters, her storytelling is always fresh. For instance, the longing, bitterness, mistrust and loyalty of the Conroy Family in her latest novel may feel familiar, but the additional character of a house adds a whole new layer to Patchett’s writing. I could picture it, and feel both its grandeur and its oppression. ""The point, I wanted to say, was that we shouldn’t still be driving to the Dutch House, and the more we kept up with our hate, the more we were forever doomed to live out our lives in a parked car on VanHoebeek Street.""The relationships between three generations of this family, against the backdrop of this house, just felt incredibly “right.”“I had only ever seen him as my father, and as my father I had judged him. There was nothing to do about that now but add it to the catalog of my mistakes.”I’m a sucker for broken families, but ultimately, what ties me to Patchett is always her strong writing. I stopped many (many) times to read a paragraph 2 or 3 times, because I am in awe of how she cuts to the emotional truth so effortlessly.""There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you’d been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet in place, and for a moment you’re suspended, knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself.""There are too many favorite lines and moments for me to type, but one that will stick with me for a while:“She might have packed her original disappointment away in a box, but she carried the box with her wherever she went.”Ann Patchett is simply an American master.

As much as i like Tom Hanks for sure i did not want him reading to me, reallly. But the more i listened the more i fell in love with the character's and the story. It's a story of family happiness, joy , sadness and so much pain but it all worked for them in such a good way that as a reader you realized that the pain and sorrow was meant to get them to a good place in their life. As a narrator Tom Hanks kept the story so calm and at peace so that i never saw the pain coming. Kudos to the author and Tom Hanks you got this one right. This story will only work for readers of love, compassion, empathy and understanding of different moral compasses, and for that i loved it❤"

185,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75183808-kathryn-in-fl,Rating 3 out of 5,"Ann Patchett's latest tale demonstrates another complex family dynamic in which a very unique and extravagant house is a metaphor for family secrets, personal desires and personal priorities. Cyril Conroy, a man with little manages to make a timely business decision that allows him to quickly achieve substantial wealth. He loves architecture and buys a grand home for his wife and young daughter, Maeve. Unfortunately, his wife does not hold the same values and feels uncomfortable with this vulgar show of wealth and opulence. Ultimately, the house represents their very different values. Which impacts their marriage and the health of their other relationships. Later, Cyril marries his second wife, Andrea, a woman, who adores the home. However, they learn that they don't seem to be able to parlay their shared admiration of the home into a thriving marriage. It doesn't compensate for the other values that they don't agree on. The pain each party feels is significant and becomes toxic in ways, they don't really understand fully. Sides are chosen and battles ensue. Bitterness rules so many of their interactions within the family that vengeance is what motivates much of the important interactions, putting peace and happiness as a nearly non-existent preference. It then becomes a pervasive force in Cyril's son, Danny's and Maeve's key life choices. Their poor priorities rob them for decades forward.Patchett is more than adequately equipped in her analysis of family dynamics. Yet, this doesn't make give any significant revelations to the reader, we haven't seen in so many other books. Though the house is a character, we have seen that done as well. Though her writing is above average, for me I don't think that alone makes it that more readable and certainly not profound. I will add that I observed two structural errors in the story that the editor should have caught and changed before the book's release (this was a published final copy not an ARC).I appreciate the lessons and insights that Ms. Patchett wishes to convey to her readers. Even today, this modern retelling of ages old parable is needed. However, I don't find it wholly original. I have read this story with different character's names, different cities, in different decades and even different countries. I was just not as excited about it as others have been. I am not saying it isn't a valuable story. I am saying I liked other's versions more (although I can't think of a title of any off top of my head (due to my traumatic brain injury)). The publisher acknowledges the nod to F. Scott Fitzgerald and it is a pretty obvious analogy to those familiar with his work. Though in many ways there are differences and I thought Fitzgerald did such a better job conveying his observations. There is a reason others copy good literature. It works. That's summarizes my opinion. This is another variation on ""The Great Gatsby"" and other novels focused on misplaced priorities in relationships. If you like that, you will probably find this likable tale.Bye the way, Charles Dickens did a bang up job in his novel using the house as a metaphor in ""Great Expectations"". This is my second book by Ms. Patchett, I may give her one more try."

One of those books that I bought on a whim because firstly, I liked the title, secondly the publishing house was Bloomsbury and thirdly the familial aspect to it.The first page had me entranced through to the end of the book and what a fascinating array of characters.The book is narrated by Danny Conroy who ""grows up in the Dutch House, a lavish folly in small-town Pennsylvania taken on by his property development father."" His parents, Cyril and Elna, had been poor but the father had done very well indeed in real-estate and their standard of living had improved tremendously. They were now very, very rich. His mother however hated the house so much that she kept coming and going and then finally disappeared. Both Danny and his elder sibling Maeve were really upset with this and finally the father told them Elna had gone to India. They never heard anything more about her until years later, five decades, and what an incredible story that proved with a most unexpected outcome.The book is fundamentally about the fixation of Danny and Maeve for the Dutch House caused by his father getting divorced and marrying Andrea who had two young girls. When Cyril dies, Maeve had already moved to her own apartment but Danny gets literally tossed out of the family home at the age of fifteen as Andrea has no wish to bring him up. There was no will but Andrea kept the house and all the businesses of her husband as she had ensured that she legally shared all the properties involved.The sections that really amazed me was that the two siblings used to sit outside the Dutch House, in Elkins Park, in Maeve's car smoking and looking in. Perhaps hoping to see Andrea? I don't know. I actually felt like a voyeur myself and when they both finally gained access to the house, well, I confess that I've never read anything like that before in my life!Like swallows, like salmon, we were the helpless captives of our migratory patterns. We pretended that what we had lost was the house, not our mother, not our father. We pretended that what we had lost had been taken from us by the person who still lived inside.

Your books, the last three in particular, have gotten me so deeply involved with your characters that I have felt bereft when they’re over. “Wait- I’m not done with you!,” I wail. And then I mourn a little and am unable to really get into other books for the next couple of days. You know this feeling? I call it a book hangover.Nobody writes about the interior lives of families like Patchett. The inside jokes, the resentments that go on for years, the little rivalries and the deep, idiosyncratic, lasting connections. This book pulls you right into its world, and I just finished it this morning (when I had other things I was supposed to be doing), but I’m sad not to have that world anymore.In this family, the mother leaves- when her son is 3 and her daughter is 10- and the father marries a wicked stepmother. The Dutch House is an amazing, one-of-a-kind mansion in the Philadelphia suburbs, and it’s called the Dutch House because the father in this family purchased it, fully furnished, decorated, and stuffed full of the former owners’ clothing and other possessions (and even a library full of Dutch books) from the Dutch family who owned it before. There are even paintings of the matriarch and the patriarch of the family on either side of the fireplace, and up they stay through the years.The stepmother is very wicked, and the repercussions of what happens to the son in this family, who is also the narrator, and his sister Maeve, who I absolutely ADORED, go on through the decades. Decades of surprising conversations, alliances, returns and departures.I don’t know how she does it. She not only creates the people, she creates this whole world. Late in the book, the narrator remembers a secret drawer in a table and finds quarters he knows have been stuffed away there for decades, and I could actually feel the slightly warped drawer opening with some resistance, smell the old wood and long abandoned change. This is delightful. Just what I want from fiction. There aren’t many writers whose ages I google, greedily, wishing for their good health and a lot more books. (Oh, good. She’s just a year older than me. Eat your green soup, Ms. Patchett.)"

Στην αρχή είχα δυσανασχετήσει με όλη αυτή τη θύελλα αναρτήσεων στα μέσα κοινωνικής δικτύωσης, ειδικά από τη στιγμή που το βιβλίο δεν είχε προλάβει καλά καλά να κυκλοφορήσει. Είχα φοβηθεί μην μου συμβεί το ίδιο με τις καραβίδες και για το λόγο αυτό εσκεμμένα πρόσεχα να αποφεύγω τα σχόλια που το αφορούσαν γιατί για εμένα ήταν ένα βιβλίο το οποίο εποφθαλμιούσα πριν ακόμη μεταφραστεί στα ελληνικά και δεν ήθελα να επηρεαστώ ή με προκαταβάλει κάτι που μπορεί να έχει γραφτεί είτε με θετικό είτε με αρνητικό τρόπο. Αρχικά, ξεκινώντας από το εξώφυλλο χαίρομαι πάρα πολύ που οι εκδόσεις Δώμα αποφάσισαν να κρατήσουν αυτό της ξένης έκδοσης, καθώς πιστεύω πως δύσκολα θα βρισκόταν κάποιο άλλο να το ξεπεράσει. Κατά δεύτερον, όταν ξεκίνησα επιτέλους να το διαβάζω ενθουσιάστηκα πάρα πολύ που η αφήγηση γινόταν σε πρώτο αντρικό πρόσωπο, αφού από την περίληψη είχα την εντύπωση ή ότι θα ήταν σε τρίτο ή πως θα γινόταν από τη μεριά του κοριτσιού. Και τρίτο και βασικό είναι ότι αγαπώ να διαβάζω ό,τι μοιάζει ή έχει σχέση με οικογενειακό saga ακόμη κι αν το συγκεκριμένο αφορά μία διαλυμένη οικογένεια, αφού πολύ γρήγορα στο βιβλίο τα δύο αγαπημένα αδέλφια, η Μέιβ και ο Ντάνι, μένουν μόνα και μάλιστα εξοστρακισμένα από την πατρική τους οικία. Η άτακτη κι άδικη αυτή φυγή θα γίνει και το σημείο αναφοράς τους όσα χρόνια και αν περάσουν, με το παρελθόν να μοιάζει σαν αναπόδραστος παράγοντας για τη μετέπειτα ζωή τους. Το Ολλανδέζικο σπίτι γίνεται κάτι σαν εμμονή, αφού μέσα σε αυτό έζησαν μαζί με τους γονείς τους και είναι αναπόσπαστο κομμάτι από την παιδική τους ηλικία που σαν να τελείωσε απότομα την εποχή που αναγκάστηκαν να το αποχωριστούν κι ας μην είχαν όλα τα μέλη της μεγάλο θαυμασμό για αυτό όσο καιρό ήταν κάτοικοί του. Είναι ένα πολύ τρυφερό στην ουσία του βιβλίο με μία από τις πιο δυνατές κι αξιομνημόνευτες αδελφικές αγάπες που έχω συναντήσει σε μυθιστόρημα.

I can’t write a balanced review of this book, even though I’ve read and absorbed the whole story and retained more than enough of it to do a writeup on it. It’s just that, thinking back on this novel, which I listened to on audiobook, and also while I was listening to it, all I can/could focus on is how much Tom Hanks’s voice got in the way. This is entirely on me. I’m used to listening audiobooks in general and to famous voices too, and it’s never happened before. The famous person always faded into the background and became just a voice. Here, it was Tom Hanks overlaid on every scene. He never just became a narrator telling a story. This is one of those cases where I would’ve enjoyed eye-reading a lot more. Less interference. I don’t know why I didn’t realize this early on and just pick up another format immediately because it spoiled the story. It’s no longer “A Story”. It’s “The story told by Tom Hanks”. And that colours every single part of it. And it’s extremely annoying. Because I’ve only read Bel Canto so far, and found it brilliant, and loved Ann Patchett’s writing, and have a couple of books by her in physical form in a pile or shelf somewhere. And I had to pick this one, and Tom Hanks, of all people, ruined this one for me. Which is so strange to say, because I love Tom Hanks as an actor. Very much. I’m actually very distraught about this. I did think it was a very odd casting. And the only way I can make sense of it is he must’ve bought the movie rights and will be in the lead role? I’m just surmising. It all quite odd. TO ME. I’m sure other listeners will be fine with it. I’m an odd fish. I mean, how many people do you know who write non-reviews about why they can’t write a proper review of a book by an author they like and have actually read?! "

We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we're not seeing it as the people we were, we're seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.” There’s not much I can say about The Dutch House that has not been said yet, so I’ll keep it short and sweet. The audio book narrated by Tom Hanks is perfection, without “doing” any voices he becomes every character and infuses the story with some added humor. I thought this was well-written, not necessarily beautiful and flowery, but Ann Patchett has a way of saying something in just the right way, so finally something that you have always known now has words to express it. I really liked Maeve and Danny, but felt that many of the other characters, especially Celeste, could have been more developed. The ending also wasn’t as strong as the rest of the book, but still worth your time.Oh, and that cover! think it’s my favorite for 2019."

194,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2050107-jane,Rating 4 out of 5,"I loved Ann Patchett's last novel and that caught me by surprise, because I had liked some of her earlier books but she had never been one of those authors I felt I must read and must look out for a new book.Not until that book made me look out for this book.When I first caught a glimpse I saw that it was a beautiful object,  when I read the premise of the story I was intrigued, and when I started reading I was captivated.I thought of it for some time after I had finished reading, and I realised that it was a book that I had loved on a number of different levels.It's a book about people. Many books are, but this is one of those books that make you feel that that you are reading about real people, that you might have mutual friends, and that a friend might have told you some of this story, because there are a great many people in the world who have stories that are more than worthy of retelling.I believed in the people in this book. I believed they lived and breathed and that their stories were true.This is also a book about a house.Seen from certain vantage points of distance, it appeared to float several inches above the hill it sat on. The panes of glass that surrounded the glass front doors were as big as storefront windows and held in place by wrought-iron vines. The windows both took in the sun and reflected it back against the wide lawn.The Dutch House was named not for its architecture but for the nationality of its original owners, the Van Hoebeeks, who had built it when they prospered in the twenties. Their home boasted Delft mantels, marble floors, ornate fireplaces and gilt ceilings;  it was adorned with silk chairs, tapestry ottomans and oil paintings; and it was a house like no other.By the late forties the Van Hoebeeks had lost everything, and so they sold the Dutch House to Cyril Conroy, an ambitious property developer who had risen from humble beginnings. He acquired everything - the house, the grounds, the furnishings, the staff - and only when he brought his family to see the house for the first time did he tell them that he owned it and it was their new home. His wife, Elna, and their children, Maeve and Danny, were transplanted from a small apartment to a grand, ready-made new home and lifestyle with no warning at all.Cyril saw the  Dutch House as a the ultimate symbol of his success, but Elna saw it rather differently. She saw it as a work of art but she knew that she could not be happy there, that it would never be her home; and her spirit faded, she began to spend more and more time away from the house, until that day came when she didn't come 'home' again.It wasn't long until an attractive young widow with two daughters found her way into Cyril's life, and into the Dutch House. She would become his second wife, she would take possession, and when the children of the first marriage would be pushed out. They would return to look at the Dutch House, but they would keep their distance and they would have to make their own way in the world.All of that had lovely echoes of fairy tales. These echoes were strong and yet that story felt utterly real and natural.The story unfolded beautifully. It had a clear path, and there were many interesting developments along that path. Some of those developments I expected, but some I did not. There were times when I thought that the story was going to go one way but it went another, and so I was always interested, and though I had an idea of where things might be going I was never entirely sure.Those stories had the untidiness of real lives. Mistakes of the past were repeated, but maybe that is inevitable.“We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.”The evolution of the characters and their relationships was fascinating. As the younger characters grew up and the adult characters aged some things changed and some things remained the same; and though some of their actions seemed improbable their lives all felt utterly real. My perceptions of characters didn't change too much but as I spent more time with them I came to understand them much better.They weren't characters to love, I didn't want them to be more that friends of friends, but I did want to learn their stories.This stories had much to say, they were written with intelligence and insight, and they were a joy to read."
195,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"First, a confession (of sorts). I was ill when I was reading much of this book. Not a serious illness, happily, but one of those viral things that cloud vision and mind alike. Hence, I'm not clear on which reactions come from the book and which from my befuddled state. That said: I liked the book a lot. The story was addictive and the characters engaging. It's probably the most accessible of the author's books I've read, but beneath its pellucid surface lay matters of great depth. I'll leave plot summaries to readers far more capable than I.The book bears within it an implicit question that expands over the course of the story. Patchett might have given it any number of titles, but naming it after the house itself can't help but intrigue. ""Dutch House"" as in ""Bleak House""? The ""House of Usher""? What is the building meant to signify? And why does it have such remarkable power over the characters, drawing them irresistably toward it again and again, and then propelling them away? What the Dutch House means to each person in the book is the engine that drives the story. ""I was still at a point in my life,"" a character thinks, ""when the house was the hero of every story, our lost and beloved country."" But elsewhere, the same character will observe:  The Dutch House was impossible. I had never thought that before. When Maeve told me that our mother had hated it, I couldn't even understand what she was saying. Time in ""The Dutch House"" is not linear. The story moves from past to present to future and back, and more than a few major revelations are made in an offhand manner (as in, 'many years later, when I was serving a life sentence for murder' -- NOT a real example, just meant to give an idea of what I mean: it's not central to the plot, but it's not nothing either). The effect of this temporal fluidity on the reader is less a matter of confusion than it is a lens that draws attention to how our perceptions change over time. What a young mind perceives as meaning one thing, the same mind looking back decades later understands to mean something entirely different. Even in adulthood, things are not necessarily what we take them to be.Indeed, ""The Dutch House"" is at its heart an examination of how flawed our perceptions can be, how mistaken our memories, how complicated our relationships and motivations, how surprisingly little we know about ourselves and the people around us. Time and again the protagonist will discover how wrong he was about something he was certain he ""knew.""  There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you'd been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet in place, and for a moment you're suspended, knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself.  Such moments resonate, sometimes touchingly --  After so many years I thought less about [my father's] unwillingness to disclose and more about how stupid I'd been not to try harder.  -- and sometimes with wry but insightful irony --  The truth is I have plenty of memories of her being perfectly decent. I just choose to dwell on the ones in which she wasn't. And this:  'God's truth,' Maeve said. 'Our father was a man who had never met his own wife.' There is much in ""The Dutch House"" to be pondered and (though I hate the word) unpacked. There are echoes of Gatsby and Dickens here, but I suspect readers will respond more with a slowly building sense of recognition in Patchett's depiction of memories, families, and motivations. I can't imagine a reader who will not pause for several moments and wonder (critically? understandingly?) at a character's behavior or decisions. (I could give some examples that I'm sure would intrigue readers of this review, but I don't want to risk sharing spoilers.)""The Dutch House"" will find a broad and eager audience. It deserves to."

А потом клокотать от несправедливости стало меньше, сказочная шпаклевка начала осыпаться, пока в руках не остался просто спокойный тихий роман про людей, которые живут свои спокойные тихие жизни. Они постоянно оглядываются на прошлое, но это им нисколько не мешает добиваться своего. Они грустят о том, что у них отобрали, но это не становится психотравмой. Они заботятся дру�� о друге, но не так, чтобы читатель обзавидовался или получил сахарную кому. Например, книги Энн Тайлер для меня немного чересчур добрые и милые, а у Энн Пэтчетт всего в меру, без патоки и разбитых сердец.Казалось бы, в истории про отобранный дом и исчезнувшую мать должны стремиться вернуть дом и найти мать. Нет, тут будут заниматься замороженными овощами и нелюбимой медициной, потому что «так надо». Тут нет погони за счастьем — Мэйв и Дэнни уже по-своему счастливы, а новые обстоятельства лишь делают их жизнь еще чуточку лучше. Энн Пэтчетт, в легком стиле и крупными мазками, уместила в 300 страниц жизнь целой семьи. При этом, как было при чтении «Щегла», все вокруг будто бы залито золотистым светом — драма приходила внезапно и без нагнетания, на хороших событиях мы слышали пару диалогов, а затем камера отдалялась, чтобы не нарушать интимность момента и позволить семье побыть наедине друг с другом. При этом автор как будто немного отстранён от персонажей и вроде бы не сильно о них заботится. И это понятно, поскольку в своем желании насолить Мэйв становилась не самым приятным человеком, а ее успешный брат лишь переживает, что хочет скупать дома и сдавать их в аренду, а не вырезать аппендиксы и говорить семьям больных, что у пациента обнаружен рак. Но несмотря на все это, книгу невозможно отложить в сторону — ты проваливаешься в историю, мчишься по ней, поражаешься естественным диалогам и логичности всего происходящего. Ты радуешься, что никто не забирается на трибуну, не вещает о пластике, загнивающем искусстве или демилитаризации, тут умилительно смотрят невыносимый балет «Щелкунчик» и говорят о вечном и важном. Да так хорошо и складно, что и читателю потом останется «на подумать». Особенно хорошо посмотреть на историю Мэйв и Дэнни глазами Нормы и Брайт — сводных сестер, оставшихся в Голландском доме. Про них нам ничего не говорят, но там есть чему сопереживать, поэтому обратите внимание.Эта книга отличный повод никуда не пойти и остаться дома. Ее можно поставить на полку, а потом перечитывать раз в несколько лет, как пересматривать любимый фильм, который знаешь наизусть. Может, «Голландский дом» чуть слабее «Своих-чужих», но, знаете, всем бы такие книги. Энн Пэтчетт для меня точно главная писательница 2021 года!"

You know that feeling-warmth, trust and the belief the other person genuinely cares. Ann Patchett’s uncomplicated narrative flows off the page-it is beautiful in its simplicity. This novel is about a complex American family. There are characters to love and to despise. It was so easy for me to lose myself in the story and I believe the simple but brilliantly written narrative was the reason. Patchett did not overuse any literary techniques or tricks. Let’s talk about the book’s cover. It is stunning in its simplicity just like the book. In addition, it does not include two figures with their back to the reader, so overused recently. The cover actually has a strong connection to the book-again rare in today’s publisher’s art departments. This cover alone, the expression on the girl’s face, will intrigue potential readers who may never read Patchett previously. Loved, loved, loved this novel. Rush to your local bookstore or library and pick up a copy. Put it on your book club’s list, purchase copies for Christmas gifts and sit back and enjoy this book just as you would getting together with your oldest and best friend. "
198,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17465866-anni,Rating 4 out of 5,"Ann Patchett writes like another of my favourite American authors - Anne Tyler, with character-driven plots revealed through convincing dialogue. In this novel, fairytale elements and archetypes abound, along with references to many characters in literature: we have the perennial wicked stepmother, the banished or abandoned children, plus the ghost stories or a haunted house as in Henry James’ Turn of the screw, and the thwarting of love and ambition in Great Expectations. There is even a curtained window seat reminiscent of another orphan tale, “Jane Eyre.” Despite these mythical aspects, Patchett manages to make the narrative plausible enough to suspend disbelief, although the reason for disappearance of the mother stretched my credulity.The story unspools and loops backwards and forwards, so that we see it from the differing perspectives of the narrator as he grows up and recollects on the past which, as we now know, is not only another country, but one where the landscape alters when seen from the distance of time."

Ms. Patchett's style is unadorned, fluid, and breathes with confidence and assurance. I have often said, that aspiring mystery writers should read all of Agatha Christie's novels, and learn how to truly write a mystery.In the case of Ms. Patchett, I would say that all aspiring, serious writers of drama should read this wonderful writer's works. This is the third book I have read by her, and each one was wonderful and a lesson in how to write fluid, lucid, enthralling novels with great characters.Maeve, the main female character in the book, is so perfectly developed through five decades of her life that you feel like you know her intimately, as though you have lived next door to her your whole life. The story is told in first person narrative by her younger brother Danny and it is the relationship between Maeve and him that is so inspiring and loving. It is a book that will stay with you for a long time. I highly, highly recommend."

I always imagined the house would die without us. I don't know, I thought it would crumple up. Do houses ever die of grief?

Look at the three of us, undone by a house. It's insane.

Home is so sad. It stays as it was left,Shaped to the comfort of the last to goAs if to win them back. Instead, bereftOf anyone to please, it withers so,Having no heart to put aside the theftAnd turn again to what it started as,A joyous shot at how things ought to be,Long fallen wide. You can see how it was:Look at the pictures and the cutlery.The music in the piano stool. That vase.(Home is so Sad, Philip Larkin)
It doesn't take long for the reader to grasp that 'the Dutch House' is going to be a character in this novel; the title is a big hint, and then the novel begins with a description of the house's features, including the life-sized portraits of the VanHoebeeks - the creators and first owners of the house. The VanHoebeek story is portent and cautionary tale: a fortune suddenly made, a house built to be a family's crowning glory, then a series of tragedies and losses. But it wasn't until I neared the end of the story that I realised that The Dutch House reminded me of Manderley (in Rebecca) - surely one of the most famous house-as-characters in all of literature. The house is a shifting symbol : a place of safety, or a prison. Its ownership is contested. Its caretaker loves it best. It falls into decay and then is restored. It is the paradoxical shuttered heart in Larkin's poem: it holds the family's memories, but when the family no longer exists, those memories become unutterably sad.Memory, and our reconstructions and misunderstandings of the past, are major themes of this book. The idea of a house as a repository of memory is the cornerstone of the plot. The book takes place during the post-war decades (late 1940s to early 1990s) when America was experiencing a huge economic expansion - the 'golden age' of the middle class. The era in which home ownership, for the many and not just the few, was an achievable dream. The Dutch House is an exemplar of a house, but the importance of property and home ownership recur again and again in the plot. Both Danny, the book's narrator, and his father are property developers. Home ownership, and its opposite - homelessness - play a variety of roles in the plot. The story is told from the point-of-view of Danny Conroy and he's an interesting sort of unreliable narrator. I couldn't quite decide if he was unreliable, or only limited. Danny often gets the wrong end of the stick. He doesn't know everything, he doesn't always ask questions, he wasn't around for some of the most important developments and furthermore his understanding is hampered by what my mother has always referred to as 'male obliviousness'. The story jumps back and forth in time, and the reader can only piece it together when Danny does. In some novels, the reader can see and understand plenty that the narrator does not grasp; this novel is not like that. Instead, Patchett skilfully builds up the story by feeding pieces of it to the reader via Danny. There are several fairy-tale tropes in this book: there is Andrea, the wicked usurping stepmother, and there are Maeve and Danny, the children who have been displaced from their home and cursed to wander in the wilderness (in the style of Hansel and Gretel). Maeve has the colouring of a Snow White, and also that of her Irish mother - who has been missing for many years. The past tends to repeat itself, and it was satisfying as a reader to see the missing parents of Maeve and Danny come into focus as they themselves grew up. This is not only because they begin to learn more about their parents, but also because the two main characters replicate personality characteristics and patterns of behaviour first set in motion by the older generation. Danny exemplifies that well-known quotation by George Santayana: 'Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.'
There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you'd been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet in place, and for a moment you're suspended, knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself.

The problem, I wanted to say, was that I was asleep to the world. Even in my own house I had no idea what was going on.
The plot turns on a hinge which wasn't entirely believable to me, but allowing for that, it was a hugely enjoyable and satisfying read. Patchett writes such clear, elegant prose, and the book was beautifully constructed and held my attention throughout. Although Danny narrates the book, Maeve was the stand-out character - truly one of the best characters in Patchett's canon. A solid 4.5 stars"

205,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5067228-marianne,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Dutch House is the seventh novel by NYT best-selling American author, Ann Patchett. It had been Danny’s childhood home. Cyril Conroy had bought the incredible Dutch House, there in small-town Pennsylvania, in 1946 for his young family: his wife Elna, and five-year-old Maeve. It was just as the last Van Hoebeek, the original owners, had left it: furnishings, fittings, even clothing. Danny was born a few years later, and lived there until his step-mother threw him out at fifteen.Danny’s mom had left when he was three; he was eight when Andrea Smith first came on the scene, but he and Maeve dismissed any idea of permanence. Andrea persisted, though; Andrea was fascinated with every detail of The Dutch House and Van Hoebeek family, who had made their fortune in packaged cigarettes. Had Maeve and Danny paid more attention, they might have seen the signs, they might have predicted, but not prevented, it: just three years after she had first stood in front of the Van Hoebeek portraits in the drawing room, Andrea married Cyril, and took up residence in The Dutch House with her daughters. No longer were they the comfortable Conroy trio, lovingly cared for by Sandy and Jocelyn. Danny had counted on following his canny father into real estate and construction; instead, Maeve insisted he study medicine at Columbia: their father’s trust, grudgingly dispensed by Andrea, was covering the not-inconsiderable cost. And on visits home, the siblings would park on Van Hoebeek Street, regard The Dutch House, and fume over their stolen inheritance, their self-made father’s fortune.Maeve, aware Cyril’s humble beginnings, was the most resentful; Danny had “never been in the position of getting my head around what I’d been given. I only understood what I’d lost.” Not until a career had been gained and discarded, and a marriage and children made, some twenty-seven years after they had been ejected from The Dutch House, did Maeve and Danny finally acknowledge what their obsession had done to them: “We had made a fetish out of our misfortune, fallen in love with it. I was sickened to realize we’d kept it going for so long”While Danny’s wife seems resentful of his close relationship with his sister, it is not until a certain, somewhat familiar old woman turns up at Maeve’s hospital bed that he realises: “I had a mother who left when I was a child. I didn’t miss her. Maeve was there, with her red coat and her black hair, standing at the bottom of the stairs, the white marble floor with the little black squares, the snow coming down in glittering sheets in the windows behind her, the windows as wide as a movie screen… ‘Danny!’ she would call up to me. ‘Breakfast. Move yourself.’”This is very much a character-driven story, and it clearly demonstrates Patchett’s literary skill: her characters are interesting and allowed to grow and develop, to display insight and utter wise words. The bond between the siblings is so well portrayed, it’s impossible not to feel for them. Like Anne Tyler, Patchett manages to make the lives of fairly ordinary people doing fairly ordinary things worth reading about.Patchett’s prose is wonderful: “The madder Maeve got, the more thoughtful she became. In this way she reminded me of our father – every word she spoke came individually wrapped” and “Her wrist looked like ten pencils bundles together”. And that striking cover? It neatly ties the whole thing together, beginning and end. What a wonderful read!!"
206,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9582364-andrea,Rating 5 out of 5,"4.5★, rounded up.I was thrilled to receive an advance copy of this book from Bloomsbury, as Ann Patchett is one of my favourite authors. While reading it, I couldn't help but compare it with her previous novel, Commonwealth, which I liked but didn't love. This one, I loved. Both are strongly character-driven stories about family, but somehow The Dutch House also has more plot and was therefore more satisfying as I turned the final page.Told in the first person, from the point of view of Daniel Conroy, this is the story of 3 generations of the Conroys and their relationship to the Dutch House in Elkins Park. The house is such an integral part of the story, it's like a family member in its own right. Built by cigarette-distribution magnates, the VanHoebeeks, the house has become ridiculously opulent in what became suburban Philadelphia, but was probably considered more tasteful or understated as part of the vast Elkins Park countryside of the pre-war era in which it was built. When the last of the VanHoebeeks died, Cyril Conroy was able to buy it lock, stock and barrel, for a good price. The house came fully furnished and decorated with all the VanHoebeeks possessions including clothes, ornaments and paintings. The life-size twin portraits of Mr and Mrs VanHoebeek continued to oversee the life of the house long after they were gone, from their position in the drawing room. Mr & Mrs VanHoebeek, who had no first names that I had ever heard, were old in their portraits but not entirely ancient. They both dressed in black and stood with an erect formality that spoke of another time. Even in their separate frames they were so together, so married, I always thought it must have been one large painting that someone cut in half. Because the house also came with one of their former staff, Fiona, the stories of the Dutch family stayed with the house and it was almost as though the VanHoebeeks became an older, more remote generation of the Conroy family.However, the purchase of the Dutch House was the beginning of the end of Cyril's marriage to Elna (Danny's mother), and therefore an early catalyst to his unhappy second marriage, to the much younger Andrea Smith. Both of these events necessarily shaped the close relationship between Danny and his older sister Maeve, as their father became more distant.Although the story jumps back and forth from when Danny was about 4 years old, to his late 40s or early 50s, Patchett skilfully brings the reader along and there is no danger of getting lost. There is a very recognisable arc that proceeds in a traditional linear direction over the top of the detours and meanderings. Towards the end, some threads of the story even come full circle and for me this was particularly satisfying.Danny's narration has a friendly, almost confiding tone that really draws you in and makes you care about his family. He admits to being a funny (i.e. odd), unobservant kid - such as the time he suddenly realised the housekeeper and the cook were more than just workmates - and this serves to highlight the exceptional traits of his beloved sister. Due to their closeness we also get to know Maeve pretty well, or perhaps I should qualify that and say we know her family life pretty well. We don't know her personal life, although there are hints and we can speculate about what's going on there. But when I think about my own brother and me - with a similar age gap - I think that's realistic!Despite being banished from the Dutch House while Danny was still at high school, the house continues to be a magnet for Danny and Maeve long into their adult lives until they consciously decide to give it up. And then after a major disruption in the family, the Dutch House once again takes centre stage. I thought this was the perfect ending, providing the opportunity to get over so many regrets for so many characters.I could go on - there is so, so much more. Suffice to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the past few days, being immersed in the richly detailed, warm world of the Conroys and their Dutch House."

I did this as an audio book and am so glad I did, Tom Hanks was the perfect narrator and addition to this story. For the most part it ends up that most books I read or listen to have a female protagonist. I somehow ended up having both my physical book and audio book both be a male protagonist this time around. That for sure doesn’t happen often for me. It was a definite bonus for this particular book. Our Goodreads synopsis informs us that “At the end of the Second World War, Cyril Conroy combines luck and a single canny investment to begin an enormous real estate empire, propelling his family from poverty to enormous wealth. His first order of business is to buy the Dutch House, a lavish estate in the suburbs outside of Philadelphia. Meant as a surprise for his wife, the house sets in motion the undoing of everyone he loves.The story is told by Cyril’s son Danny, as he and his older sister, the brilliantly acerbic and self-assured Maeve, are exiled from the house where they grew up by their stepmother. The two wealthy siblings are thrown back into the poverty their parents had escaped from and find that all they have to count on is one another. It is this unshakable bond between them that both saves their lives and thwarts their futures.Set over the course of five decades, The Dutch House is a dark fairy tale about two smart people who cannot overcome their past.”“Disappointment comes from expectation.”It was amazing to me how the recollection of the same events differs between siblings, just as in real life. Being an only child I always find the dynamics of siblings fascinating. Between the story following the siblings and the rest of the family sagas this book checked all the boxes for me. I loved the time span of the five decades and how seemless it was. It flowed wonderfully and never felt disjointed or confusing. I was completely immersed the whole time. I particularly liked Danny questioning so many things about growing up and his family that he never took the time to ask or wonder about previously. I also enjoyed how his character struggled with what he wanted to do with his life. Do you choose to do what you like to do or do you choose to do what your loved ones expect you to do, when you are successful in both? He also has the dilemma of where does your loyalty stand, with your blood or with your spouse or significant other? Can it be both?There were so many enjoyable characters in this book. Not just the primary ones. There were bits of humor scattered throughout and lots of thought provoking events. I felt so many emotions during the course of this book and that is always a sign of a good book to me. It was descriptive and when I wasn’t listening to it I was looking forward to when I would be again. This book has many amazing reviews and they are very well deserved. I’m very glad I finally got to this one, and I am already missing it. "
208,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5990485-mary,Rating 4 out of 5,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ / 5I listened to the audiobook of The Dutch House by Ann Patchett which was narrated by Tom Hanks and it really just heightened my experience with this book! What it's about: Danny and his older sister Maeve live with their dad on a large estate known to everyone as the Dutch House. Their mom leaves when Danny is young, and the siblings are eventually kicked out of the Dutch House by their stepmom when Danny is a teenager. Set over five decades, The Dutch House focuses on two siblings that can't let go of their past, and the course their lives eventually take. They say the narrator can make or break an audiobook and I definitely agree. I could listen to Tom Hanks all day and I loved that he was the narrator of The Dutch House. He spoke the words with the heart they deserved and emphasized the beauty of this novel. This is my first experience with an Ann Patchett book, and it will definitely not be my last.I saw a couple reviews that mentioned The Dutch House might not be the best book to read first if you are new to Patchett, but I was instantly consumed with the story and all the pain of this family saga. I loved Danny and Maeve even with all of their flaws, and I ended up loathing their stepmom (like any good person would do). Patchett really knows how to move you with her words and characters, and this was a very emotional book. I thought the writing to be both beautiful and eloquent, and I am kicking myself for not reading one of Patchett's books sooner! The Dutch House took me on a journey through Danny and Maeve's lives, and all the pain and heartaches this family endures. There are happy times that made me smile and chuckle as well, so don't worry - this book isn't all just one sad journey! Song/s the book brought to mind: 100 Years by Five for FightingFinal Thought: The Dutch House was my first time listening to a fiction book as an audiobook and I absolutely loved my experience with it. The audio is just shy of 10 hours but the minutes pass quickly and Hanks makes for an excellent narrator. If you are into family sagas with beautiful, descriptive words I highly recommend picking this up ASAP!"

I was not disappointed.THE DUTCH HOUSE is told by Danny Conroy, looking back at his life that began in an old mansion that his father had bought to impress his mother, who instead grew embarrassed by its over luxuriousness, eventually choosing to leave her family. Danny and his older sister, Maeve, became wards of a less than loving father and eventually an ambitious step mother. What follows are decades of calamity, uncertainty, close bonds come and gone, with Danny and Maeve always drawn back to the house that made them, forced to wonder why certain events occurred and whether they could forgive the adults who did them wrong.Pratchett is a quiet writer but her pride is elegance and entrancing, the plot shifts subtle but moving. Hanks' narration is pitch perfect, never too dramatic, but with enough depth to capture the emotion of Danny's story.Definitely one of my favourite reads of the year, a perfect gift for parents looking for a book to capture them."

All three are able to take an everyday life and turn it into a novel. If you need spectacular or uber exciting, this may not be what you are looking for. But if you like life-like, steady and richly written this Patchett novel is for you. I listened to this novel on audio. It was narrated by Tom Hanks and he did a fabulous job of it. His pitch and tone and inflections were great. You could feel the characters some to life under his reading. Two siblings are stuck! Stuck in the time they lived in the Dutch House. This novel moves through five decades and you see the growth of both siblings. The growth, influenced by the Dutch House. We are able to walk through the lives of both Maeve and Danny, seeing it from their perspective, seeing it from the each others perspective and also from the outside by additional characters. Inheritance, loss and disappointment, our appearance to others, our appearance to ourselves, truth and lies, hopeful thinking, and realization of the truth are all themes throughout this novel.As I said, not a flashy novel, just the simmering life of siblings, as they both obsessed over their lives as associated to the Dutch House.

The book is pretty good, and interesting and feels real and all that, OK. BUT and this is a HUGE BUT - what would this book be, without the voice of Tom Hanks?! And I can't stop wondering why on earth haven't I fallen for his voice and him so far? I mean, I would recognize his voice, always, but I haven't listen to it like that in a movie, or anywhere else for that matter! I haven't been crazy about the sound of it. Holy Jesus, I am in love with a voice and I want, no, I NEED to listen to Tom Hank's voice till the end of the world, and maybe two more bonus tracks after that.

He allows the story to be told without making himself a character in the novel.Ann Pratchett clearly is a natural storyteller so this was definitely worth reading yet I don’t think this will be one of those books I think of in months to come.The fixation on the Dutch House, representing everything that Maeve and Danny had lost, was presented in vivid imagery and I also really enjoyed the strong bond portrayed between the siblings. Their love for each other endured throughout illness, parental abandonment, familial displacement, and an evil stepmother.The book addresses forgiveness and the choices we make in life that has a ripple effect not only on ourselves but others for decades to come.Recommended for readers who like complex family dramas."
214,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/714583-anita-pomerantz,Rating 5 out of 5,"Well, like the rest of all my friends who read this back in 2019-20, I LOVED this book. The Dutch House introduces us to a single parent family living in a gigantic historic mansion. The two children, Maeve and Danny, are the focus of this character-driven story which really is about family dynamics and how wealth can impact a family in very unexpected ways. Patchett is so clever in the way in which she reveals her stories. I think she really understands human nature, grudges, forgiveness, and love, and finds a way to reveal the truths behind these emotions to her readers without ever telling them what to think. And I think every reader will find a character or two to relate to in this particular story. If you haven't read this one yet, I highly recommend it. I like an Patchett in general, but I enjoyed this one more than Bel Canto and State of Wonder."

All I can figure out is that I was swept away by a master storyteller. One who can make a house into a major character. One who can develop characters with a fine brush. One who can move at a snail’s pace and I’m perfectly content. Each word seems to be right exactly where it belongs. I’ll come back to edit this review if my thoughts become more cohesive with time. I just finished it today.
216,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3292905-julie,Rating 4 out of 5,"I enjoyed this sweeping tale read with aplomb by Tom Hanks. He was believable as Danny, the brother and narrator of the story. What stood out to me was the strength of the bond between Danny and his sister, Maeve, and their strength of character. I remember being taken by surprise one day when someone pointed out that our longest lifetime relationships are those with our siblings. This is a wonderful example of a dedicated sibling pair. As for the house, which also appears as a character, I would love to have a window seat with the drapes that enfold you creating a quiet den for reading. "

The two siblings then wade through poverty and share a very special bond as they move their way through the murky waters of their lives.Although not lengthy, it is a slow paced book.

222,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5067228-marianne,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Dutch House is the seventh novel by NYT best-selling American author, Ann Patchett. The audio version is narrated by actor, Tom Hanks. It had been Danny’s childhood home. Cyril Conroy had bought the incredible Dutch House, there in small-town Pennsylvania, in 1946 for his young family: his wife Elna, and five-year-old Maeve. It was just as the last Van Hoebeek, the original owners, had left it: furnishings, fittings, even clothing. Danny was born a few years later, and lived there until his step-mother threw him out at fifteen.Danny’s mom had left when he was three; he was eight when Andrea Smith first came on the scene, but he and Maeve dismissed any idea of permanence. Andrea persisted, though; Andrea was fascinated with every detail of The Dutch House and Van Hoebeek family, who had made their fortune in packaged cigarettes.Had Maeve and Danny paid more attention, they might have seen the signs, they might have predicted, but not prevented, it: just three years after she had first stood in front of the Van Hoebeek portraits in the drawing room, Andrea married Cyril, and took up residence in The Dutch House with her daughters. No longer were they the comfortable Conroy trio, lovingly cared for by Sandy and Jocelyn.Danny had counted on following his canny father into real estate and construction; instead, Maeve insisted he study medicine at Columbia: their father’s trust, grudgingly dispensed by Andrea, was covering the not-inconsiderable cost. And on visits home, the siblings would park on Van Hoebeek Street, regard The Dutch House, and fume over their stolen inheritance, their self-made father’s fortune.Maeve, aware Cyril’s humble beginnings, was the most resentful; Danny had “never been in the position of getting my head around what I’d been given. I only understood what I’d lost.” Not until a career had been gained and discarded, and a marriage and children made, some twenty-seven years after they had been ejected from The Dutch House, did Maeve and Danny finally acknowledge what their obsession had done to them: “We had made a fetish out of our misfortune, fallen in love with it. I was sickened to realize we’d kept it going for so long”While Danny’s wife seems resentful of his close relationship with his sister, it is not until a certain, somewhat familiar old woman turns up at Maeve’s hospital bed that he realises: “I had a mother who left when I was a child. I didn’t miss her. Maeve was there, with her red coat and her black hair, standing at the bottom of the stairs, the white marble floor with the little black squares, the snow coming down in glittering sheets in the windows behind her, the windows as wide as a movie screen… ‘Danny!’ she would call up to me. ‘Breakfast. Move yourself.’”This is very much a character-driven story, and it clearly demonstrates Patchett’s literary skill: her characters are interesting and allowed to grow and develop, to display insight and utter wise words. The bond between the siblings is so well portrayed, it’s impossible not to feel for them. Like Anne Tyler, Patchett manages to make the lives of fairly ordinary people doing fairly ordinary things worth reading about.Patchett’s prose is wonderful: “The madder Maeve got, the more thoughtful she became. In this way she reminded me of our father – every word she spoke came individually wrapped” and “Her wrist looked like ten pencils bundles together”. And that striking cover? It neatly ties the whole thing together, beginning and end. What a wonderful read!!"
223,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5 stars. I very nearly gave it a 5 star review. And it's close, but just not quite there.After some ponder time, I believe this is tied for my most favorite Patchett. And that's saying it's GOOD. I liked State of Wonder as much, but this one is probably more ""universal"" as combined families have been for decades, and are also becoming- the near count majority. It's one of the largest and prime reason that I lived the non-remarriage serial monogamy route. Serial monogamy marriage being closest to ""normal"" since about 1975. In the USA and other places it was even earlier. I've seen too many kids get the shaft from their parent's marriage partner. Worse than this couple of siblings. Marriage laws are, IMHO, intensely unfair- and not only in the inheritance frames either.But Ann Patchett has hit superbly upon the siblings of ""us"" vs ""them"". And defined the Father who walked the oversee line without really ""seeing"" any true essence reality for/ of ""after"" at all.A great siblings story that is probably far outside of median, but purely and supremely nuanced beyond any I think I've read in decades. Also that Mother who thinks of herself (and others seem to agree?) as ""saint fodder"". I think Ann Patchett performed a miracle in positing her as she did. What an impossible task she accomplished to equate her values and her actions in the prose language of subtle flow and calm. I could hardly read about her in any semblance of the same. Of such priorities are the most highly duplicitous and do gooders who gush their superior sensibilities made. Save us from their ""know better than others"" examples and screen us, PLEASE from the fall outs of their values' actions.Andrea is supposed to be the heavy in this one. The wicked step-mother personified? She was a welterweight evil, IMHO. The real Mom was the heavyweight brand! Gag me.Read the book to find out what I'm posting. No more review. Take the crux of this plot without more knowledge.It lost a point in the jumps of ""eyes"" and back-biting time flows. They were too abrupt and put there to cause unknowns to heighten the tension. They weren't needed. Maeve and Dan only need to sit in the vehicle across the street from the Dutch House while smoking their ""last"" cigarette. Sit, talk and smoke; once, once and once again. That was sufficient tension. Constant and lifelong sort of which only those who have lived in it or have seen it up close (like our household help here at the Dutch House) know. Maeve's portrait on the hardcover is GORGEOUS. I do not think at all she looked grim- she looked exactly like Irish girls I have know who are SO trying to be a ""good girl"". Also loved the wall paper."

I grew up in the Ditch House, and Sandy and Jocelyn and Celeste were my family, and nothing else.This book is fantastic. It's easy on the heart and somehow so heavy, so demanding of my emotional abilities and inner self, that there were moments when I, quite literally, couldn't breathe. It's very well written, and the story flows from one chapter to the next, Danny being a reliable and wonderful narrator. (And the audiobook? I hear Tom Hanks is FANTASTIC). Every character was dynamic and compelling in their own way, even The Dutch House itself, deserving of as much attention as any other character due to all the power it exerts over each one of them.This book is also delightful, but not too sappy. A family saga of sorts, it moves through the decades from Danny's point of view, as he tells the story of his life and the house that represented so much to so many.

I would not have read it otherwise based on mixed reviews and the cover. After listening, I completely understand the cover and it is the perfect cover. I listened to the Audible version narrated by Tom Hanks who does a masterful and memorable job.If you appreciate literature and have enjoyed books read in literature classes, then I strongly suggest The Dutch House. The house is truly central to the story, and in my opinion, the main character. All of the relationships in the story are viewed through/impacted by the Dutch House. All of the characters are flawed. Each character has aspects I connected with and others that rubbed me wrong. Though it appears Danny is the story teller (and he is not the most observant character), Maeve and the Dutch House permeate every aspect. The Dutch House must be mentioned well over a hundred times, but the time I found most impressive was during The Nutcracker. That scene was absolutely brilliantly written.I loved Danny’s relationship with his father. His father reminded me so very much of my grandfather. Danny wants nothing more than to walk in his father’s footsteps, and he even repeats the same major mistake that his father made. Maeve was the most memorable character for me, but then there’s Fluffy! WOW! The many layers of Fluffy! Who would have thought! Loved the development of this character. No spoilers. Just words. Chemistry. Frozen vegetables. The train. The Painting. The car. Cigarettes. What a powerful story of loss and redemption. Everything comes full circle. Everything was resolved. An impressive literary masterpiece."

227,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1654645-deb-readerbuzz-nance,Rating 4 out of 5,"A good writer doesn't need explosions or stabbings or scary monsters to tell a story. A good writer can take a poor family and an old mansion and make a mesmerizing tale of love and loss, of misunderstanding, of struggle and gain, of searching and finding. A good writer can create the family and the mansion and put them together and see what happens. A good writer can take simple things and make a story of great complexity and emotion. Ann Patchett is a good writer. The Dutch House is the story of the Conroy family and their relationships over time with each other and with the mansion, the Dutch House. People do as people do. People give others surprises and the surprises are not what the others want. People leave and offer no explanations for their disappearances. People meet and come together for what appears to be random and unexplainable reasons. In short, The Dutch House is the story of the lives of a few people, unremarkable lives, perhaps, but also lives of depth and fascination. (Oh, and the fact that I listened to this story as an audiobook read by the great Tom Hanks did nothing but add bonus points to my rating of the novel.)I was entranced by this story of a boy and his sister, abandoned by their mother, orphaned by the loss of their father, put out in the world, with the strength of having each other to rely on, with the eventual and inevitable weakness of having only each other to rely on."

Rather I was hooked right from the start. Ann Patchett's writing was brilliant. She brought to life a version of a Hansel and Gretel with a modern day approach. It was centered around the themes of a loveless childhood, banishment and a very controlling, plotting and cruel step-mother in a most believable way. The Dutch House was about a special bond between siblings, a sister and a brother, the house, the Dutch House, where they grew up and the effects their pasts had on their present day lives. I was able to listen to The Dutch House on Audio CD read by Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks' narration really put it over the top for me. This was definitely my most favorite book by Ann Patchett.Danny and Maeve's father surprised his wife and mother of his children, Elna, with a gift one day. After taking a long drive, the family arrived on the outskirts of Philadelphia at a very unique house. As they pulled up to the house, Cyril (Danny and Maeve's father) told their mother that he had bought The Dutch House for her. When they entered the house Elna's reaction was not exactly what Cyril expected. To Elna, The Dutch House was more of a museum with all its ornate furnishings than a home. Elna never felt comfortable within the walls of the Dutch House. The only room that she felt at ease in was the kitchen. Beside the ""stuffy, ornate furnishings"" Elna was gifted household help. These women became her allies and confidants and for Danny and Maeve they became their ""fairy godmothers"". Cyril was not a warm, loving, fuzzy father. He was strict, successful, and hard-working but lacked the ability to show his love to his own children. Elna had always had the calling of being a nun or helping those in less fortunate circumstances. Living at the Dutch House began to put pressure and discontentment at the forefront of Elna's life. Although she loved her children, this discontentment was too strong for her to ignore. Not long after moving into the Dutch House, Danny and Maeve's mother abandoned them. The two siblings forged a very special bond with each other. Maeve almost took on the role of mother to Danny. Danny relied on his sister completely. Their father retreated into himself even more after their mother's disappearance. Sandy and Jocelyn, the housekeepers, become more involved in Danny and Maeve's day to day lives. Then the very unexpected happened. Cyril brought Andrea home to the Dutch House. From the very beginning Maeve and Danny do not like Andrea but their father seemed to have fallen for her and went along with all her conniving ways. Andrea brought her two daughters to the Dutch House to live with them when Cyril and Andrea got married. The first thing Andrea contrived was to take Maeve's room away from her and give it to one her daughters. Maeve was banished to the attic. Cyril allowed this to happen. Andrea's worst acts were only about to take shape. Neither Maeve nor Danny could have seen these things coming. Andrea was the all encompassing stereotype of the evil step-mother.The Dutch House by Ann Patchett moved me greatly. I was absorbed from the first page and did not want it to end. It was and remains rare to witness a bond so strong between siblings. It was beautiful and yet some may have felt that it was not natural. The house, the Dutch House, held that bond together at its core and would not let go. Even when Danny and Maeve no longer lived there a magnetism from the house pulled at them and brought brother and sister back to it. The Dutch House was told through the voice and memories of Danny. It took place right after World War II and spanned over five decades. The one constant throughout the book was the love that Danny and Maeve shared for one another. I loved the ending. All good things come full circle. I highly recommend The Dutch House by Ann Patchett for all those who have not read it yet.I received a complimentary copy of The Dutch House by Ann Patchett from Harper Collins Publishers through Netgalley. Opinions expressed in this review are completely my own. Thank you Netgalley, Ann Patchett and Harpers Collins Publishers for this opportunity to read The Dutch House."
237,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/109502514-bookmonkey,Rating 3 out of 5,"Rating: 2.75🍌Like the majority of contemporary American literary fiction, you can be pretty confident that you know what you're getting into with an Ann Patchett novel: polished if unassuming prose, an immersive character-driven narrative, and a plot arc punctuated by poignant moments that resolve into an equally poignant conclusion. These traits are largely on display again here in THE DUTCH HOUSE, a Pulitzer Prize finalist that traces the dissolution of the Conroy family vis a vis the eponymous home they once lived in. Cyril Conroy is a self-made real estate baron who, shortly after WWII, purchases a Pennsylvania mansion known as the Dutch House as a gift for his wife, Elna. When the novel opens, though, Elna is out of the picture -- the mystery of why she left the family is not immediately revealed -- and we learn that Cyril is now a single father who largely leaves the raising of his children, Maeve and her younger brother Danny, to his servants.The novel is told through the retrospective perspective of Danny, who grows up in the shadow of his mother's absence and the larger crisis that occurs when his father marries Andrea, a young mother of two with an unhealthy obsession with the Dutch House itself. We follow Danny as he goes away to boarding school, attends Columbia for university and med school, gets married to Celeste and has kids while embarking on his own real estate business. The story of Danny's life events is not especially compelling -- he’s another self-absorbed white guy capitalist -- but Patchett employs an interesting chronological structure to texture it just enough to keep you going. What really drives the book is Danny's relationship with Maeve, who took on a maternal role for her younger brother after their mother left; the relationship between the siblings is largely forged through the crucible of their memories/relationship to their parents and the house in which they grew up. Indeed, their touching and well-wrought relationship was the only thing that kept me reading to the end of the book, which loses steam and direction after a very engaging first third. The major problem with THE DUTCH HOUSE is the lack of texture and dimension to the characters and their relationships. Andrea, the stepmother, is an over-the-top witch without a shred of empathy; Celeste and Maeve hate each other for absurd reasons; the father -- a war veteran and real estate mogul -- is an irredeemable wimp who refuses to stand up for his children; the oft-repeated explanation for Elna abandoning the family is unbelievable. Even Maeve and Danny's relationship, by far the strongest element of the book, begins to feel a bit flat and repetitive by the end of it. Because Ann Patchett is an accomplished writer, I tried to convince myself that this was on purpose, perhaps as part of an intended fairy tale structure -- the enchanted house in the woods, the wicked stepmother, and, if that wasn't clear enough, at one point Celeste even complains to Danny that he and Maeve are ""like Hansel and Gretel"" -- but if this was the intention it requires too much generosity from at least this reader to work. Yet Patchett manages to pull it together enough to deliver an ending that evokes genuine emotion, tying the characters and plot threads from throughout the novel into a (perhaps too) tidy conclusion. I’m just not sure whether it’s worth reading 350+ pages to get there."

Accanto alla casa olandese vi è una protagonista femminile, Maeve Conroy, il cui destino è indissolubilmente legato a quella casa in cui la sua famiglia si trasferì quando suo padre Cyril improvvisamente divenne ricco grazie a giusti investimenti immobiliari: la casa olandese ha visto, impassibile e fredda nella sua eleganza e sfarzosità, il disfarsi di una famiglia, devastata dalla fuga della madre di Maeve e di Danny, il narratore, il fratello minore legato ossessivamente alla sorella. Quanto accaduto all’interno di quelle mura superbe e bellissime ha segnato l’esistenza dei protagonisti del romanzo, che per questo motivo ne sono rimasti avvinti come da un incantesimo, tanto che, per anni, dopo che da quella casa sono stati cacciati via, i due fratelli torneranno abitualmente a sostare, nascosti all’interno della loro macchina, di fronte alla maestosa costruzione, per spiarne le luci e le ombre, per ricordare un’infanzia triste e dolorosa, per non dimenticare l’abbandono, ma anche per consolarsi del dolore patito insieme abbandonando il passato per tuffarsi in un futuro che sempre ha le sue radici in esso.Un romanzo particolare, sia nella scrittura, con continui salti temporali, che nella narrazione, asciutta, che non cade mai nel sentimentalismo tanto da far pensare a una freddezza di fondo dei personaggi, che vivono emozioni profonde senza che la scrittrice calchi la mano. A volte mi ha lasciato sconcertata, però la lettura è risultata nel complesso piacevole e coinvolgente."
239,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/74844479-wyndy,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5 stars.‘The Dutch House’ is my sixth novel by Ann Patchett and frankly one of my least favorites. This book started out so strong with Maeve Conroy and younger brother Danny soldiering through the desertion of their mother Elna, the aloofness of their father Cyril, and the life-changing second marriage of their father to a truly sinister woman named Andrea who adds her two young daughters to the mix. I enjoyed the stories about the history of the Dutch House and its former owners, and the early days of Maeve and Danny’s parents’ relationship, and Cyril Conroy’s rise to success in real estate, stories mostly shared by “the help” at the Dutch House - Fluffy, Jocelyn and Sandy. These loyal, hard-working women were the threads that bound all the characters in this book together. What I did not like: The changes in timeline within the chapters was confusing and eventually annoying. The “stalking” of the Dutch House by Maeve and Danny for years and years became tiresome. The waste of such huge sums of money on Danny’s education was unconscionable (yes, I understand why, but still . . .). And Part Three was unrealistic and almost Hallmark-hokey for me. But then again, I’m a pretty unsentimental person. I will continue to read anything Ann Patchett writes because she is an outstanding author. I just didn’t love this particular novel like most readers did.“But we overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.”~ Danny Conroy"

Aquele tipo de história simples, sobre relações (neste caso, entre dois irmãos) que costumo adorar 🙌🏼---------------------Demorei um pouco a publicar opinião sobre este livro, porque senti necessidade de refletir sobre ele e de o absorver completamente... Gostei tanto de o ler que está, sem dúvida, entre os melhores do ano!! 😍Danny (o narrador) e Maeve são dois irmãos que vivem numa deslumbrante casa que, outrora, pertenceu a uma família holandesa (daí o título). A casa tem uma presença muito forte, ao longo de todo o livro, e mesmo quando os irmão são expulsos pela madrasta, continua a ter um simbolismo e um papel relevante nas suas vidas.É daqueles livros em que a história não parece ter nada de extraordinário, mas é tão envolvente que é impossível não nos rendermos. Adorei a relação e as dinâmicas familiares (mais do que das personagens em si) e acho que é esta a grande essência da história. A escrita também é maravilhosa. Já tinha lido outro livro da autora, ""Comunidade"", que provocou em mim o mesmo efeito magnético e, definitivamente, Ann Patchett entrou para a lista de autores de quem quero ler tudooo. Vale mesmo a pena! 🥰"

Well yes, me too. A bit realistic fairy-tale (the wicked stepmother, Hansel & Gretel), where this scores is in the characterisation, especially of Maeve, part sister, part maternal figure to the narrator. I'd say this will appeal to readers wanting a traditional family story. For me, I found it frustrating that no-one could get beyond the past with this constant circling back to what has gone before. The writing is unobtrusive, plain and simple prose, nothing inventive. An undemanding read but with a tangible sense of warmth and love between the brother and sister protagonists."
242,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13798293-kristie,Rating 4 out of 5,I really loved this book. This is the first book that I've read by Ann Patchett and I can't wait to try something else. I loved her writing and her characters. I was able to be absorbed by the story and was engaged the entire time. This book really made me think about kindness and forgiveness. There were a couple of characters that I honestly felt were incredibly selfish and some of the other characters were very forgiving of and caring towards them. I'm not sure how I would have responded to them if they were in my life. I listened to the audio narrated by Tom Hanks and he was excellent. I felt he was the perfect choice to represent our MC. 4.5★

245,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36193941-tanzila-tabassum-zisha-annabel-lee,Rating 4 out of 5,"Nominee for the 2020 Pulitzer Prize for fiction. This is a complex and impressive family drama/ historical fiction revolving around The Dutch House. The house that becomes a character itself, that decides the actions of the characters throughout their lives as they find themselves coming back to its doorsteps again and again. Prepare to feel yourself crushed under nostalgia and melancholy when you read this. Even though the writing isn't manipulative, Danny's gloomy reminiscence is enough to cast a shadow over the reader's heart. The story is mainly focused on Maeve and Danny and their sibling relationship - the bond that sprouts from sharing a mother that abandoned them and a distant, lonely father. The bond that goes through the fire of being evicted from their own inheritance, and strengthens. It's about an evil stepmother straight out of the pages of a fairy-tale. All basic elements, twisted in their heads just a little. It follows the sublings, Danny and Maeve, throughout their lives as they keep going back to the house, park in the street in front of it, and think back on various incidents in their lives. Intermittently, we see those incidents playing out in flashback.At one point, they realize how they wasted all those times sitting outside the house, holding onto the hatred for a life that would never be theirs again. 
“Just imagine if she’d come to get the paper sooner,” she said. “Say, twenty years ago.” “We could have had our lives back.” 
Sometimes forgiveness is unbearable. Especially when one finds themselves wronged by someone who is family. Maeve finds herself unable to forgive her stepmother, just as Danny can't accept their own mother's return, each getting resentful of the other's intolerance. Something I found interesting is that all of the characters - however benevolent or compassionate - had a streak of cruelty to them, and for good reasons. There was no character that could be purely blamed as a villain. I liked the first portion of the book better. I loved their formative years and sibling interactions. After they got older and especially after their mother came back  I started feeling disconnected from the story and the characters apart from Maeve. To be honest, I just didn't want to continue reading after  Maeve died. That was where the book ended for me. Maeve was indisputably my favorite in the whole set of nuanced, realistic characters. Her wasted brilliance, her sisterly affection, kindness, anger - all of it cemented her place in my heart as one of my most cherished female characters.Throughout the book, we see many times references to Maeve's red coat. Though I was sure she didn't wear the same coat all her life, it felt odd that she'd always wear red. And then after reading the part where she was recounting the days when her painting was being done, I saw the connection - that it was because Simon told her to. This was such a nice little touch. A lot can be said about this book. It's really what you'd call a multifaceted story. Each of the characters had their own reasons to act in a certain way, maybe that way was a mistake, but who doesn't make mistakes? Reading this book made me feel like being wrapped in a blanket of homesickness. At some parts I just had to put down the book and drift back to my own childhood. 
“I remember at night we’d turn out the lights and bring a lamp into the bedroom closet, and push out the shoes so we could sit on the floor and read. Dad was on air raid patrol. You had to pull up your knees so you could fit and then I’d come in behind you and sit in your lap.”""We had changed at whatever point the old homestead had become the car: the Oldsmobile, the Volkswagen, the two Volvos. Our memories were stored on VanHoebeek Street, but they weren’t in the Dutch House anymore. If someone had asked me to tell them very specifically where I was from, I would have to say I was from that strip of asphalt in front of what had been the Buchsbaums’ house, which had then become the Schultzes’ house, and was now the house of people whose names I didn’t know.""“Do you think it’s possible to ever see the past as it actually was?”""There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you’d been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet in place, and for a moment you’re suspended, knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself.""
On another note, I was excited to see that the audiobook narrator was Tom Hanks. But as much as I love this guy's acting I didn't love his narration."

248,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2592286-kerry,Rating 5 out of 5,"The worse thing about reading a five star book is--you can only read it for the first time once. I was sad to finish this book but I have to say the last 1/4 are what sealed the deal for me. I love Patchett's books, have read them all and wait expectantly for the next. Still some reads are better than others. It is hard to put my finger on exactly why this one was a home run for me. The story is about too siblings, older sister, younger brother (he tells the story) who weather several storms together and are very close. Their mother leaves the family when the younger is 4 and the older sister is 12. Father who is building owner (rentals apt. buildings in NYC) eventually remarries and the new wife (with two young girls of her own) is less than kind to her step children. How this effects their lives going forward is the meat of the story. Patchett has written about combined families previously--most recently in Commonwealth-- and it is a theme she is drawn to in her stories. I've heard reviews saying the Dutch House is like a character in this story--I did not feel that. The house provides a context but actually I found it played less of a part than I expected. That said I did not love this book till near the end. I did listen to it on audio as I do at least half of my reading--and I must say as much as I love Tom Hanks I felt he was not the best choice for the narration. It was not his reading (in that he was exceptional) it was the fact that his voice goes with his face and the story is being told by a young boy in the early stages and knowing Hanks age and looks it really drew me away from seeing this central character in my mind. Would have loved a great reader without the baggage of being a known famous person who doesn't quite fit with the book's described narrator. That said the book felt a little whiney to me at first but these characters are so well drawn and the story while it has few revelations is so well told and has such a great ending I know I will be drawn to read it (in print form) soon again. I could gush and try to pin point why it was so good but if you love family dramas and character driven stories don't let this one pass you by. I envy you your first reading. Hope you find it as engaging as I did."

In  The Dutch House  we meet Cyril Conroy, who through the luck and some real estate knowledge came into great wealth. Through this new found wealth Cyril was able to purchase The Dutch House which was previously owned by a Dutch family who came to ruin. Cyril purchased this sprawling mansion in the countryside of Philadelphia as a surprise for his wife- this began the down fall of the Conroy family. The book is told from the perspective of Cyril's youngest son, Danny. Danny gives us an in-depth look into his relationship with his older sister Maeve and what becomes of The Dutch House and those who lived and worked in the house. A five decade long narration that will keep you utterly enthralled the entire way. The Dutch House is the grounding point of the book because this is where all the relationships, conflicts and problems arises. From the housekeeper being thrown out, to the Danny and Maeve being told to leave with just their clothes and no inheritance to speak of... but this is where the story begins. I absolutely loved this book. Ann Patchett did an amazing job of showcasing sibling relationships, mother daughter-son relationships, sainthood and forgiveness. The characters were well formed, you knew exactly who Maeve and Danny were and their character motivation. Reading this book will have you rooting for these siblings. The book goes between the present, the past and the in-between so seamlessly and this is a testimony to Patchett's writing. There is this suspense that keeps building because of the unanswered questions- but everything comes together in the most organic and beautiful way. If you love family drama this is your pick. If you are looking for a truly heart warming sibling relationship- this is it. If you are a fan of Ann Patchett- just know she delivers with The Dutch House. Highly recommend- I am still nursing my this hangover"

Then at age fifteen, after his father dies unexpectedly, his step-mother-from-hell kicks him out of the house. His older sister then fills the psychological role of mother in his life, but when the long-ago-disappeared biological mother shows up after forty years and his older sister is more interested in visiting with her than with him it is experienced as another loss. The drama of lost mothers is supplemented with the haunting memories of the big house that our protagonist was forced to leave as a fifteen-year-old. As one would expect from the book's title, the house becomes very real by the end of the book.One question I asked myself as reader was what sort of mother leaves a family of two children ages 3 and 10 with zero contact for over forty years? And when she reappears we learn that she has spent her life being a saint serving the poor. Serving the poor is an admirable then to do, but cutting off a relationship with your children to do so? The book's narrative does remind readers that throughout history there have been many men who have abandoned their children--some of whom were thought of as being great men.The portrayal of the step mother in this book must be a modern day recreation of a character from Charles Dickens. Some step-mothers are wonderful parents and love their step children, but not in this book. The older sister in this book has type 1 diabetes, and the story contains one vignette when the blood sugar is out of balance. This segment of the story can serve as an educational experience to readers like me who have limited knowledge of what diabetics have to deal with.The above mentioned items and many others are combined to provide the readers with an interesting and compelling reading experience.

I loved the characters even though I wanted to slap all of them at some point. I was worried for a good portion of the book that there wouldn't be a resolution, that it would just sort of drift into a ending, the way the lives of the main characters were currently drifting, but Patchett very skillfully steered this story into a resolution that was both unexpected and yet perfect. Also, Tom Hanks reads this audiobook. It was amazing. He was perfect for it. Warm and funny and very Tom Hanksian. He didn't do the women's voices in a high, wispy voice or anything weird or condescending, as male readers sometimes do. He read the chapter headings with various levels of exuberance which was just . . . so Tom Hanks!And listen, I want to post a bit of a spoiler, without marking the whole review as a spoiler.

This is the story of a family and a house and how the decisions taken inside that house affect all people that live there and how it keeps affecting them all thought their lives. The main characters are a pair of sister and brother. You could argue that the Dutch house is a character too because it always looms in the back permeating all of the main characters decisions. I love the normalcy of this novel after reading so many books in different genres. While this was a good novel I still don’t understand why this book had over a 100 holds in the library I work at.

These people weren't as fully fleshed out or as original as others. The beginning was strong, and it held my rapt attention up to a certain point, but by the end I was struggling. Still, liked but didn't love."

258,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56146790-whitney,Rating 4 out of 5,"Overall: A beautifully written novel about an unconventional family with strong characters. Themes of forgiveness, compassion, and family are strong throughout and this is a difficult novel to put down. 7/10Summary: The Dutch House is the story of two siblings, Maeve and Danny Conroy and their lives over several decades. The two are inseparable, bonded very tightly after their mother leaves home when they're very you. The Dutch House is their home, a 1922 mansion outside Philadelphia that their father, Cyril, a real estate mogul, bought fully furnished in an estate sale as a surprise for his wife. His wife hates everything about the house and flees to India to dedicate her life to the poor. Cyril remarries and there is a strained relationship between the stepmother and Maeve and Danny. The story follows their lives for over fifty years.The Good: I listened to this book as narrated by Tom Hanks and it was amazing. Probably the best audiobook I have listened to and he was the perfect voice for Danny's character. This novel reads almost like a modern day fairytale; it reminded me a lot of Hansel and Gretel. The characters are very well developed with lots of unique personality and the writing is wonderful throughout. Some suspense and sharp turns along the way and I had a hard time putting this one down.The Bad: There was a plot throughout but at the end I found myself wishing for more. I thought there would be a twist, some major surprise, or just a bit more plot so felt slightly let down when I finished. And though I felt like I got to know all the characters very well, I did not particularly love any of them.Favorite Quotes: ""Do you think it's possible to ever see the past as it actually was?"" “There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you'd been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet in place, and for a moment you're suspended knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself.” “But we overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.” "
259,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/160592927-kristi-c,Rating 5 out of 5,"I rounded Dutch House up to 5 stars based on Tom Hanks narrating the audiobook. He is an amazing storyteller whose voice seems like home, so the story seemed more enjoyable. Excellent choice for the narrator! I probably would have rated the story itself a 4 or so had I been reading the book.This was my newest randomly chosen audiobook (thanks #27 💕) for my dog walking and ironing. I normally miss turning pages in a book, and while I obviously cannot do that while walking, this time I was happier listening to the book and would recommend the audiobook.It was a bit slow at first, and often wondered where the story was going, but by the time I was further in, I didn’t care where it was going. I just enjoyed the storytelling and was connected to the characters. My heart broke for certain characters. It was a good read if you enjoy family dramas."

Anna Gralak) to miejscami wzruszająca, chwilami brutalna bajka, wspaniała opowieść i doskonała lektura.""Wszyscy w Elkins Park wiedzieli, co się dzieje w Domu Holendrów"", pisze Danny, narrator nowej powieści Ann Patchett. Znajdujący się na przedmieściach Filadelfii, Elkins Park na początku XX wieku stał się popularną miejscówką wśród biznesowej elity stolicy Pennsylwanii. Olbrzymie domy, jak neoklascysyyczny Lynnewood Hall z ponad setką pokoi robią wrażenie, choć też dają do myślenia o tym, jak kształtowały się gusta amerykańskiej klasy wyższej. Bardzo ważna dla nich było znalezienie swojego miejsca na ziemii, które będzie odwoływało się do ""wielkiej"" historii, stąd zamiłowanie do klasycyzujący form ale też nawiązań do stylu Tudorów, czy holenderskiego stylu kolonialnego, ale też pokazujące, że świat się zmienił, przez co domy te często pełne były najnowocześniejszych sprzętów i rozwiązań.Dom Holendrów zawdzięczał swoją nazwę jednak właścicielom, “Holendrom z niemożliwym do wymówienia nazwiskiem”. Ukończono go w 1922 roku. Siedem lat później ""bankierzy zaczęli wyskakiwać przez okno"".Tuż po II wojnie światowej posiadłość pełną stylizowanych na flamandzkie portretów rodziny VanHoebeeków kupuje Cyril Conroy, potentat na rynku nieruchomości, człowiek o niezbyt rozbuchanej emocjonalności. Jego pasji do Domu nie podziela Elna, żona Cyrila. Dwójka dzieci, Maeve i młodszy od niej o siedem lat Danny, choć wychowani w tej zaskakującej posiadłości, też mają do niej stosunek dość krytyczny, zwłaszcza, że nie mogą przyjmować szkolnych przyjaciół. Co nie znaczy, że nie jest to ich dom, centrum świata, axis mundi.To mógłby być bardzo przewidywalny dramat rodzinny, może z jakimś rozwodem w środku, zabraniem dzieci od ojca, tułaczką po mniej okazałych rezydencjach, dramatem zdradzonej żony, dzieci wychowywanych bez ojca, ale nie jest. To Elna zostawi rodzinę, dzieci i postanowi wyruszyć w świat. Przez długi czas osoby czytające książkę Patchett nie będą wiedzieć ani gdzie się podziała, ani jakie były przyczyny porzucenia przez nią rodzinnego chłodku. Matka marnotrawna, której odruchowo zaczynamy kibicować.Po kilku latach do Domu Holendrów i życia Cyrila wprowadza się Andrea z dwójką swoich dzieci. Maeva i Danny muszą zająć się sobą, a raczej to Maeva musi zastąpić matkę Danny'emu. Dorastają, idą na studia, ojciec umiera, a Andrea przejmuje władzę absolutną nad rodzinną rezydencją. “Każda oglądana z dystansu konfiguracja luksusu wydawała mi się oknem z widokiem na moje dzieciństwo” pisze Danny oglądając “Dziadka do orzechów” w jednej z najlepszych scen tej książki.Zachwycające jest to jak Pattchett opowiada historię Conroyów i ""Domu Holendrów"", nie spiesząc się, powoli buduje napięcie, szczegółowo opisując relacje między bohaterami, pokazując ich emocje i dojrzewanie. Grają tu zarówno oczywiste symbole jak portrety holenderskiej rodziny wiszące na ścianach, czy “W kleszczach lęku” Henry’ego Jamesa (w przekładzie Jacka Dehnela, “Dokręcanie śruby”) czytane przez Maeve, która była miłośniczką angielskiego pisarza.Patchett umiejętnie buduje portrety postaci drugoplanowych, wprowadza je w doskonale wybranych momentach, a to jak precyzyjnie komponuje książkę przypomina dzieła Fitzgeralda. Nie da się pewnych skojarzeń też uniknąć, bo zarówno autor ""Wielkiego Gatsby'ego"" jak i amerykańska pisarka piszą o kryzysach etyki w zamożnej, nowej klasie mieszczańskiej. Patchett również niezwykle inteligentnie nawiązuje do amerykańskiej i brytyjskiej prozy opowiadającej o dzieciństwie, ale mit, który buduje nie jest tkliwy, nostalgiczny. Nie przypomina “Małej księżniczki”, a raczej historię znaną z “O czym wiedziała Maisie” Jamesa, powieści może niezbyt udanej ale będącej dla pisarza ćwiczeniem w pisaniu z dziecięcej perspektywy.To proza konkretna, twardo stąpająca po ziemi. Nie ma u Patchett tandeciarstwa emocjonalnego, nikt nam nie karze rozpaczać nad upadkiem domu bogatych białych ludzi, nie prosi o litość, a pokazuje mechanizmy które za tym stoją. Jest tylko jeden irytujący swoim banałem moment - gdy Andrea po śmierci męża i ojca dwójki głównych bohaterów przejmuje dom i finanse Conroyów, okazuje się, że dla Danny’ego przeznaczony jest fundusz na studia, którego Andrea nie może ruszyć. Patchett nie pozwala swoim bohaterom upaść zbyt nisko w hierarchii społecznej. Samo rozwiązanie narracyjnie jest dość prostackie, ale jakoś to trzeba było wyjaśnić.Patchett opisuje życie ludzi bez zbędnych emocji, na spokojnie, powoli budując dramat. Jest to powieść, która przywodzi na myśl holenderskiego malarstwo, bo z precyzją, światłem jak u flamandzkich mistrzów, którzy lekkie sceny rodzajowe przerabiali na wielkie symboliczne opowieści. Elkins Park wkracza do literatury i zapewne stanie się celem wycieczek fanów i fanek “Domu Holendrów”. Patchett zaś pokazuje się nam jako współczesna klasyczka, doskonale łącząca tradycyjną powieść, przewrotną bajkę z nowoczesną narracją, która pozwala bohaterom, a zwłaszcza bohaterkom robić rzeczy, których do tej pory nie mogli robić.Bardzo podoba mi się fakt, że wydawca nie poszedł po taniości i książkę wydaje w twardej oprawie, większym formacie i dobranej kolorystycznie kapitałce, bo to jest książka, którą warto traktować trochę lepiej. Polecam Państwu."
261,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33448518-kansas,Rating 5 out of 5,"Esta novela está contada a la manera de los cuentos de hadas y que a su vez gira en torno a una mansión, fastuosa, colorida y casi encantada, una casa que es habitada por los Conroy, la familia que la ocupa cuando empieza la novela, aunque la novela parece que empieza de cero una y otra vez. La Casa Holandesa es una mansión construida en 1922 por una antigua y rica familia holandesa que cuando cae en desgracia y se arruina, es comprada con todo lo que hay dentro por Cyril Conroy como sorpresa para su esposa. Los Conroy habían sido pobres hasta que Cyril empezó a hacer dinero con la compraventa de edificios, así que la casa es una especie de simbolo de estos nuevos tiempos de riqueza para él. Sin embargo, su mujer, Elna, con una mentalidad completamente diferente, no es capaz de acostumbrarse a esta nueva riqueza, a esta casa que la supera estéticamente y no puede entender que con tanta pobreza haya gente capaz de vivir en un lugar tan ostentoso, así que muy pronto abandona a su marido y sus dos hijos pequeños, Maeve y Danny dejándoles en la casa holandesa.""Cuando se presentaron en la Casa Holandesa aquel primer dia, se creían gente pobre. Ella lo obligó a contarle como había conseguido el dinero. Lo obligó, de verdad. Estaba convencida de que había hecho algo ilegal. En esa época nadie tenía esa cantidad de dinero"".Este impactante abandono de Elna a su familia, es lo que marca el resto de la novela. Los niños crecen en un principio en un ambiente cálido pero la ausencia de su madre les marcará ya definitivamente porque una especie de misterio o interrogación define sus vidas...¿porqué si eran una familia feliz, su madre los abandona??? La figura de Elna, ausente durante casi toda la novela, es también al mismo tiempo un personaje siempre presente, nada invisible, porque continuamente se la está nombrando. La novela está contada desde el punto de vista de Danny, el hijo menor, testigo de todo lo que ocurre en la casa, sin embargo el personaje que en mi opinión marca toda la novela, el personaje guia es Maeve, la hermana mayor, que inmediatamente después de la marcha de la madre, se convierte en la madre de su hermano cuando es casi una niña todavia. Maeve es luminosa, responsable, como un faro guía que marcará para siempre la vida de Danny. ""Se lo debí decir a tu padre como cien veces; que Maeve se corte el pelo. Pero no me hacía caso. Le daba igual. Yo siempre he querido que lo supieras, por tu propio bien. Llevas un pelo espantoso. Él no me lo permitió nunca. Siempre decía que era tu pelo, y punto"".Pasado, presente y futuro se yuxtaponen una y otra vez bajo la visión de Danny de los acontecimientos de su vida, que como he dicho antes, es contada como un cuento: los niños huérfanos de madre, la madrastra mala malísima, los niños desterrados..., un sinfín de acontecimientos siempre contados con esa elegancia nada dramática ni sentimentaloide de Ann Patchett. Es una novela espectacular en ese sentido porque el lector se ve inmerso en una historia perfectamente organizada, e incluso los momentos más devastadores son los más luminosos, dónde la presencia de Maeve es un pilar majestuoso. Admito que es un personaje femenino que me ha impactado y maravillado. La Casa Holandesa es un edificio que ha significado diferentes etapas en las vidas de quienes la han habitado pero a los niños Conroy los ha marcado obsesivamente y hay maravillosos momentos en torno a la casa evocados por los hermanos una vez que no viven en ella, porque no pueden olvidarla en el sentido de que los momentos más tristes y más felices de su infancia se encuentran enquistados en la memoria de Danny y Maeve a través de esa casa. ""Si alguien me hubiera preguntado antes de aquella cita cuáles eran mis sentimientos al respecto de mi madre, le habría jurado que ninguno en especial. Me costaba entender la enormidad de mi ira"".Me encanta Ann Patchett; es una escritora cuya escritura fluye casi sin esfuerzo para el lector, tan sútil y etérea en lo que cuenta, hace fácil lo más complejo.Y qué bien habla de los lazos emocionales, de los traumas de infancia y de como superar esas marcas del pasado. Me ha recordado mucho a El jilguero de Donna Tartt, porque toca todos estos temas y porque son dos novelas que me han emocionado muchísimo.""Yo, sin embargo, no podía dejar de pensar en el retrato al óleo de Maeve, colgado en el salón, sin que ninguno de los dos viviéramos en aquella casa. Maeve aparecía en el cuadro con diez años de edad y abrigo rojo, una mirada directa e inteligente y la negra melena suelta""."

Although the story is character driven, something which I usually love, and although Ann Patchett writes beautifully, I kept hoping and waiting for a strong ending. There was none. A few loose ends were tied up, but that’s it. While reading this, I imagined the home to look something like this. "
264,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/95957485-ekta,Rating 3 out of 5,"You know the kind of books that you read as a young, excited over enthusiastic reader?. when books were devoured with a frenzy that is totally true of that age! Well, The Dutch house is definitely a reminder to me of those kind of books! The kind of book, that, as an 18 year old, I would have probably given five stars..It checks all the boxes you see. Family drama with high octane emotions spilled all across the pages. Extremely likeable characters who have strong filial ties, and a sad poignant ending that as a kid I would have bawled my eyes over. Well then what’s the problem you ask?The problem simply is that I’m no longer 18! At a time when my understanding of emotions has catapulted from the highest gamut to the lowest abyss, I look at relationships a bit differently! With the cynical side eye of maturity behind me, I don’t feel as easily moved at 29..The Dutch house has a Hansel and Gretel vibe to it, with an overprotective older sister, an adoring younger brother, an evil step mother and a helpless rather pathetic sorry excuse of a father. The evil step mother wants all the money, and The fantastic mystical palace (in this case The Dutch house), but she wants nothing to do with the by products of her husbands first marriage. Sounds familiar doesn’t it? That’s because it really is! An ode to the fairy tales we listened to as kids, with unwavering attention, wrapped in a cozy quilt, secure in the knowledge that none of the vile could possibly touch us, that we are loved, wanted and safe.The Dutch house is a breezy invite into those cozy nights of your past. Fantastical yes. Memorable? I doubt it!"
265,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54033599-will,Rating 5 out of 5,"Within an hour of finishing The Dutch House I received the NYT Book Review with a front cover review of the book. Perfect timing and an excellent assessment of the novel. However, as I was putting my thoughts together here, I worried about appropriating ideas from that review (since I agreed overall and it was so fresh in my mind). Therefore, I’ll stick to the basics.I’ve been reading Ann Patchett for many years, going back to her debut novel The Patron Saint of Liars, which I received as a gift (a thoughtful one indeed). She immediately became an author to watch and after these many years has always been a pleasure to read. I have rarely been disappointed and certainly not with this new one. Patchett is not unlike many of her contemporaries (McDermott, Strout, Kingsolver, etc.) in that she isn’t a ‘flashy’ writer. Her writing feels effortless, honest, grounded; lovely, solid prose that lures the reader in with story and believable characters. Characters are, in fact, her real strength - three dimensional, rarely stereotypes. She makes you care about her protagonists and this new novel is no exception with its depiction of the bond between a brother and sister from childhood to middle age. I could quibble over a plot turn in the later part of the novel, but, again, it was such a pleasure to read that it didn't alter the overall experience for me. Might I add - a beautiful jacket cover."
266,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76100631-holly-r-w,Rating 5 out of 5,"""The Dutch House"" is a wonderful book. At the heart of it is the relationship between an older sister and her brother, Maeve and Danny Conroy. As children, their mother (Elna) left them. Maeve was 10 years old at the time. Danny was about 2 years old, so young that he could barely remember Elna as he grew older. For all intents and purposes, Maeve became both a sister and a mother to Danny. Their father, Cyril Conroy, was a self-made business man, who became wealthy through real estate. Buying, selling and rehabbing buildings excited him. In a romantic gesture, he bought an elegant mansion for his young wife Elna. The house had belonged to a wealthy Dutch family. Unfortunately, the modest Elna hated the house on sight, thinking it to be too lavish. She was more comfortable helping the nuns run a food pantry. Cyril could not understand Elna's distaste for the house. Throughout the book, the house takes on various meanings for all of the characters. It plays a major role in the story. As the story unfolds, we watch Maeve and Danny grow up. Maeve chooses not to marry and Danny becomes a husband and father. There is tension between Maeve and Danny's wife, Celeste. I will stop explaining the plot further. I loved how the author gave us such rich characters to think about in a story that is so engrossing. I appreciated how seamlessly she told the story. Her writing flowed so naturally. This is one of my favorite books read this year."
267,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3574699-jennifer-lane,Rating 5 out of 5,"Touching Family DramaI love stories that dive deep into family function and dysfunction, and this novel is one of the best. The narration by Tom Hanks adds humor and depth to the sibling story.Danny grew up without a mother, but his older sister, Maeve, filled that role beautifully. Maeve is one of my favorite characters: strong, sarcastic, sacrificial, smart--just so real. Many of the characters, including the house, feature layers of emotional wounds and believable motivations. It may seem appalling for Danny to endure the difficulty of medical school, then choose a different career path, but the author's nuanced explanation makes that choice seem like the only one that makes sense. Danny and Maeve are such lovable, accessible heroes that it's a pleasure to observe their journeys through life.However, I do not accept the choices made by Danny's mother and stepmother. I don't have children, but I can't imagine leaving your children in order to care for the masses. How about trying harder to resolve a disagreement with your husband before abandoning your family? There's a level of narcissism in that decision that is hard to forgive. I also want to know what motivated Andrea's cruelty. She's a wonderful villain but her backstory is lacking. I have to admit that the unsettled feelings these characters elicit are part of the charm and conflict of the story.A deeply satisfying exploration of family, love, letting go, and inviting in."
268,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2026178-elizabeth-alaska,Rating 5 out of 5,"Does a house make a home? I think when you're a child, it most certainly represents ""home"" and that is what the Dutch House was to Maeve and Danny Conroy. It was a beautiful house - more than a house, it was a mansion outside of Philadelphia, a very special place indeed. And then, like getting a rug pulled from beneath their feet, it was taken away from them. It was unimaginable to them how suddenly everything changed.My family did not live in a mansion by any stretch of the imagination. It was a 1400 sq ft house in a suburb of Los Angeles. But it was home and we loved that house. We didn't talk about it the way Maeve and Danny did, but throughout our adult years there were references to the house at 708. And so, on one level - the love of how a house represented love and home - I could relate to them. The story of their lives is told through reminiscence and sharing of memories. As in any family, some stories are known by one member and not by another. This is told in the first person by Danny. We know what he experienced first hand and what he is told. The story is not chronological by any means. Sometimes the time shift isn't obvious and I would go back and read a couple of sentences for it to make sense. In another author's hands, this might not work, but Patchett handles it beautifully. I loved this book from the first pages. The story never flagged, the narrative never weakened. How could I not give it 5-stars?"

I often have eyes pointed somewhere but my head is only seeing the thoughts churning behind my eyeballs. Thus it was that I listened to this audio book thinking how much the narrator sounded like Tom Hanks, only to discover at the end that it was, indeed, him. Forehead slap. His narration was like listening to someone reading a script, complete with all the changes of intonation, pace and volume that adds an enjoyable dimension to the experience. I suppose it doesn't hurt that I like Tom Hanks. I can say he read me to sleep now. Well, maybe that's a stretch. :)I enjoy novels that focus on all the messiness of human relationships, especially family ones, and this story was all about that. Yes, it's been done lots of times and ways, but I still found this an interesting read, with characters who struggle to understand and free themselves from early influences--made more difficult when critical information is missing or distorted. A novel where each main character pursues his/her own needs to the detriment of others, it raises questions about how to balance our needs with the needs of others, and how additional maturation and understanding can change how something affects you.Overall an enjoyable book, just not a great one, in terms of what catches my fancy."

This latest novel seemed shorter than usual, but did not lack for interesting characters and situations.The protagonist and narrator is Danny, who is recounting his difficult and unusual childhood, including his intensely close relationship with his sister, Maeve. With a distant father and an absent mother, the two of them have always looked out for one another. This is the story of their relationship first, and also the way each of them view and cope with the past. The Dutch House is the eccentric mansion that still symbolizes their childhood to both of them, but it is a place they cannot go home to. It's complicated--I'd recommend not reading too much about this book before starting it.I enjoyed this very much, and would recommend it! The one topic I'd like to discuss: Elna! Danny is very angry with her, while Maeve is over the moon to have her back--only to be left again. If Andrea is supposed to be the evil stepmother, I do not think she has a foil; Elna abandoned her children. Also, could Andrea have legally kicked a minor out of his home? And I'm curious about how poor Bright and Norma got on.Later note: I recently read Patron Saint of Liars, and--Rose reminded me somewhat of Elna. Two women who married too young?"

I'm shocked by my reaction to The Dutch House because I've read Patchett's novels (Bel Canto is a favorite) and much of her nonfiction, and I greatly admire her as a writer, and maybe I'm missing something here, but this novel that I was fully expecting to love, I don't. I found it only partially interesting and rarely compelling, and it missed for me at both the story and sentence levels. Family angst, yes, but everything felt at a remove. Why was Andrea as she was? Why the great animosity between Maeve and Celeste when they started out liking each other? Why was Cyril so bland? And the Dutch House itself, yes, it figures, but not in a way that made me care about it even an iota. The structure was somewhat interesting, as were two points made very late in the book and touched on only briefly: the truth that men are often congratulated for leaving their families while women are not, and the notion that families of saints don't particularly like their sainted family members. I'm very sad that The Dutch House left me mostly cold."

Bel Canto and State of Wonder are two of my top reads ever. And The Dutch House didn't disappoint. The relationship between siblings Maeve and Danny is so intense and intertwined. They're quirky and funny and good for each other and not (reminiscent of many Anne Tyler characters). It's an amazing thing for a writer to create a relationship so believable in the context of the novel yet so unlike anyone the reader personally knows. Maeve nor Danny are perfectly flawed, and they know it. They're trying so hard to make things okay for each other that they make gigantic mistakes during the course of their 50+ years together. The book slowed down during the last 70 pages (is it okay to admit I skimmed those?), but overall, it's a lovely read. We are so lucky to have Patchett among us."

The other brooding presence throughout is the Dutch House. Built in 1922, in Philadelphia, the imposing, three story glass building is the home that represents the dreams and conscience of the Conroy family.Family dynamics, the stresses and strains, the accusations, are what Ann Patchett writes about so expertly.The stepmother in literary history is well represented. She represents a challenge to the natural order of things that provides great stories of confrontation. Andrea, the second wife, is cast as the knowing interloper. She identifies a weak, lazy man (Cyril) and has no qualms about directly asserting primacy in everything that revolves around her and her children. Throw in some Machiavellian financial plotting and the reader is witness to actions of huge injustice.Do Andrea’s actions seem a bit far fetched and unbelievable? No they don’t.HighlightsPart One, which centres on Andrea, is an absolute master class in writing about vitriol, and the consequences of the pathetic non actions, and lack of assertiveness, by a father and husband as he flees to the safety of his workplace and abrogates his responsibilities in the domestic home.Maeve, who is fifteen years old at the start of the book, was my favourite character. The dynamic between her and Andrea is magnificently described.Maeve doesn’t scream and shout. Her cool, composed response to flagrant injustice is fabulous: her room is effectively annexed“It’s just like The Little Princess. They put her in the attic and make her clean the fireplaces. She turned to Norma (the young, newly ensconced step-sister  ” no big ideas for you miss. I will not be cleaning your fireplace”  (56) “She drew herself up like Saint Joan” they’ll hate you , she said, her voice matter - of - fact. Your daughters will hate you even more than we do. They’ll hate you after we’ve forgotten who you are” (93)The second and third parts of the story, Books Two and Three, don’t quite sustain the excellence of the start. Patchett structures the book in a deliberately non linear fashion, and in Book Two the back story described by Danny (the narrator throughout) is pretty unexceptional. Danny isn’t the most interesting of the characters. The third part of the book throws in a number of twists, and risks sacrificing the mostly subtle emotions aroused by the white elephant, the Dutch House itself.LowlightsMaeve is presented as a girl, and woman with abundant skills, and compassion. The absence of a life in a wider world (she is seemingly popular, and has numerous, (unnamed) friends), seems implausible.Historical & Literary•	Sibling love: I had expected to find other books in which brother/ sister are the essential focus of a story. Ones that have no sexual element. Some stories concerning twins concentrate on the essential, central bond. That’s what exists between Danny and Maeve. Danny’s wife, Celeste resents the unique bond (though, interestingly their children, and especially May, do not).•	The House. The books opening line: “The first time our father brought Andrea to the Dutch House” evokes Daphne du Maurier’s  Rebecca  “Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again”Gone with the Wind  (Margaret Mitchell) and Scarlett O’Hara’s ‘Tara’“Initially, it is a thing of pompous but shallow beauty, then a place of desolation but nevertheless still standing when the neighbouring homes are not, and finally as beautiful as ever but bereft of life and happiness” (Sound familiar?)Questions “you know Nell? She’s doing art restoration. She went to London three years ago. I don’t think she’s ever coming back”.  Not only is Professor Able a fringe character, his daughter Nell is even less featured. Why was she even mentioned?Recommend Yes, this book has some superbly crafted characters (the women especially). I’m surprised the book hasn’t been recognised in any book prize lists, as yet. I regard Ann Patchett as among my very favourite chroniclers of whole life stories."

And I've told some people that I was listening and added—pretty much always—that it seemed like cheating to have Tom Hanks narrate. We know Tom Hanks, actor, so well, don't we? We've seen him so often—once a year, maybe more—in one way or another. I'm pretty certain I've spent more time with Tom Hanks' characters than I have with members of my own family. I have watched him age, fight wars, help others, lose his way, fall in love, get sick and die. I know what his face looks like when he makes certain sounds with his voice. I know that hint of cynicism is frustration that will turn to endearment. And so, in reading THE DUTCH HOUSE which is a first person reminiscent narrator looking back at his life growing up in the eponymous house after his mother abandoned their family, sharing details of this house, and his love for his sister and his difficult father in what, throughout the novel, felt like aftermath, well, I knew him right away! I knew this Danny Conroy and so I could settle in. So is it cheating (I'm using this word very loosely and do not mean for it to imply wrong-doing by anyone involved—keep reading) to have a beloved author and actor and a much-anticipated novel come together this way? I don't know. Would less known but equally well-crafted novels benefit from having this kind of star power narrate the audiobook? I'm guessing yes. But not all books get this kind of marketing or support and so they will fall short by default. There are only so many Tom Hanks-es in the world. So, I had to put the cheating scandal aside and base this review on my listening experience. And, it was exquisite. (So, absolutely yes to the audiobook.)The novel itself, the story, was so beautifully written. I haven't read any other reviews and haven't actually heard an awful lot about this book other than general buzz about Ann Patchett's latest novel. So I don't know if Ann Patchett chose the name Conroy as an homage to Pat Conroy but listening to the sentence craft, those touches of melancholy in the language, were beautiful to me in the same way that Pat Conroy novels always touched me. I'm sure I would have gotten to THE DUTCH HOUSE in my TBR eventually but what this wonderful audiobook did is make me want to pick up the book because I want to see the words on paper and contemplate them more. Years ago I tried to read THE ENGLISH PATIENT and just could not get what was happening on the page. I loved the movie and went back to the novel with a new understanding and it opened up the book for me in a way I couldn't access before. I have a feeling listening to this audiobook first will open up the reading for me in the same way.Okay. So is that cheating? To make me fall in love like that? I don't know but it's dark now and I've just finished listening and I am on the lawn of the Dutch House. My feet are bare and I'm smoking a single cigarette, admiring my pink-painted fingernails. Beautiful people are in the glass house, holding champagne glasses, their laughter and the music and the stars are all crystals and it's clear and fragile and I'm crying a little because good fiction and a good story and a good storyteller will do that.Three years later, second reading. This time in paperback. Tom Hanks’s voice lingers but Patchett’s dignified and assured prose is the star, eclipsed only by the Dutch House itself. “My god, I love this so much.”"

Έχει ίσως το πιο όμορφο εξώφυλλο που έχω δει και κάθε φορά που το έπιανα στα χέρια μου το χάζευα και το χαιρόμουν! Τώρα όσον αφορά το περιεχόμενο, μου άρεσε αλλά το περίμενα καλύτερο είναι η αλήθεια.Οι πρωταγωνιστές του βιβλίου είναι δύο αδέρφια, ο Ντάνι και η Μέιβ, ο αδιάφορος πατέρας τους, η μητέρα τους που τους εγκατέλειψε για να φύγει στην Ινδία να βοηθήσει τους φτωχούς και το ολλανδέζικο σπίτι, μια πολυτελής έπαυλη με τεράστιες τζαμαρίες στην πρόσοψη. Ναι, θα μπορούσαμε να θεωρήσουμε και το σπίτι σαν ήρωα του βιβλίου αφού παίζει κεντρικό ρόλο στην ιστορία της οικογένειας και συμβολίζει κάτι διαφορετικό για το καθένα από τα μέλη της. Για τον πατέρα είναι η απόδειξη της οικονομικής του δύναμης, για τη μητέρα είναι σύμβολο πλουτισμού για το οποίο πρέπει να ντρέπεται αφού υπάρχουν τόσοι φτωχοί άνθρωποι στον κόσμο και για τα παιδιά είναι το μέρος που μεγάλωσαν και ένα είδος πατρίδας από την οποία τα εξόρισαν.Μετά τη φυγή της μητέρας τους, ο πατέρας των παιδιών παντρεύεται μια στριμμένη γυναίκα, η οποία έρχεται να μείνει στο ολλανδέζικο σπίτι με τις δύο κόρες της. Μετά τον θάνατο του πατέρα, όλη η περιουσία του περνάει στα χέρια της μητριάς και τα δύο αδέρφια, ο Ντάνι και η Μέιβ, χάνουν σχεδόν τα πάντα και εκδιώχνονται από το σπίτι. Στο εξής έχουν μόνο ο ένας τον άλλο και αναπτύσσεται μεταξύ τους ένας βαθύς δεσμός νοιαξίματος και φροντίδας. Συχνά μέσα στα επόμενα χρόνια πηγαίνουν με το αυτοκίνητο και παρκάρουν έξω από το ολλανδέζικο σπίτι, διατηρώντας μια «εμμονή» για το παρελθόν που τους εμποδίζει να προχωρήσουν στη ζωή τους.Η περίπτωση της μητέρας που εγκαταλείπει τα παιδιά της μου έφερε στο μυαλό την μητέρα της Κάιας από το «Εκεί που τραγουδούν οι καραβίδες». Έλεγε κάπου στο βιβλίο ότι τίποτα δεν είναι υπερβολικά απρεπές εφόσον βοηθάει να συνεχιστεί ο κύκλος της ζωής, εννοώντας, μεταξύ άλλων, ότι το μητρικό ένστικτο μπορεί να υπερκεραστεί σε περίπτωση που πρόκειται για ζήτημα ζωής και θανάτου. Η μητέρα της Κάιας κακοποιούνταν από τον πατέρα της και έφυγε για να γλιτώσει αφήνοντας πίσω τα παιδιά.Στην περίπτωση της μητέρας του Ντάνι και της Μέιβ θα μπορούσαμε άραγε να τη δικαιολογήσουμε με τον ίδιο τρόπο λέγοντας ότι έφυγε ακολουθώντας την κλίση της να βοηθάει τους ανθρώπους; Ότι ήταν κάτι σαν αγία, όπως αναφέρεται στο βιβλίο, που αν δεν ακολουθούσε το κάλεσμά της η ζωή της δεν θα είχε νόημα; Ή μήπως ένας άνθρωπος που θέλει γενικά να βοηθάει τους ανθρώπους ενώ δεν μπορεί καλά καλά να βοηθήσει τα ίδια του τα παιδιά και να αντιληφθεί το μέγεθος του κακού που τους προκαλεί, είναι απλά ένας ναρκισσιστής που βοηθάει κυρίως για να αισθάνεται μεγαλόψυχος; Τείνω προς τη δεύτερη εκδοχή, ειδικά μετά από αυτό που συνέβη στο τέλος του βιβλίου, το οποίο ομολογουμένως με ξένισε και μου φάνηκε τραβηγμένο. Σαν να έδωσε η συγγραφέας αυτή την τροπή στην ιστορία για να γίνει κάτι σοκαριστικό στο τέλος.Γενικά, μου άρεσε η γραφή της Πάτσετ αλλά κάπου στη μέση βαρέθηκα λίγο και δεν καταλάβαινα που το πάει. Μου φαινόταν ανούσιες όλες οι περιγραφές της ζωής των δύο αδερφών και οι αναδρομές στο παρελθόν, ενώ δεν γινόταν κάτι ουσιαστικό. Νομίζω πως θα μου άρεσε περισσότερο αν δεν είχε απλώσει τόσο την ιστορία και ήταν πιο μικρό το βιβλίο.Υ.Γ.: Κάπως έτσι φαντάζομαι το δωμάτιο της Μέιβ (αν και αυτό δεν έχει κουρτίνα):"
282,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8037048-erin-glover,Rating 5 out of 5,"I love Ann Patchett's work and The Dutch House does not disappoint. The book is named for the 1922 home where Danny and Maeve, an inseparable brother and sister, grow up. The house becomes a character in the story with its see-through windows, and appearance of floating on top of the hill. Yet, even though the landscaping reflects the changing seasons, The Dutch House never changes. It's filled with treasures left by its previous owners who left during the depression, furniture and drapery that are never changed after Maeve and Danny's father buy the home at an auction. While all the other characters change and grow, The Dutch House remains a constant.Their mother is overwhelmed by the house and its ostentatiousness. After nine years, she up and deserts the house and her children, bringing Danny and Maeve even closer together. Eight-year-old Danny doesn't really know what's happening when their father introduces them to Andrea, a woman who will become their stepmother, bringing her own two daughters. In the world of bad stepmothers, Andrea is right up there as one of the worst, surpassing even Cinderella's stepmothers.Danny says, ""The only thing our father really cared about in life was his work: the building he built and owned and rented out. He rarely sold anything, choosing instead to leverage what he had in order to buy more."" So he left Maeve to tend to Danny. And he let Andrea take over the house, who went so far as to give Maeve's childhood bedroom away to her daughter while Maeve was at school, on top of firing the help the children had grown up with.When their father dies, through a system of wills and trusts their father bungled, Maeve and Danny are kicked out of The Dutch House by Andrea. They become acquainted with poverty for the first time in their lives. The only silver lining is an educational trust. Danny is basically forced to go to medical school by Maeve to use up as much of the trust as is possible, leaving little for Andrea’s daughters, a seeming act of revenge. The trouble is Danny only wants to follow in his father’s footsteps, buying up old buildings. He has no interest in being a doctor.The intensity of Maeve and Danny’s relationship is the highlight of the novel. For those of us who aspire to such relationships or know they are not possible, their tender care for each other over the years will tug at your heartstrings. Ultimately, this is a story about how a brother and sister’s love for each other transcends circumstances that would cause others to break. Death, revenge, illness, and socio-economic status all play a part in holding the story together. The surprise ending will pull your heart in all directions.Ann Patchett is a genius at dissecting family relationships. Her characters are rich and complex. You will hate some of them and love others. The rub is deciding if a particular character deserves hate, love, or forgiveness—or all three."
283,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33119635-neil,Rating 4 out of 5,"In the 1940s, Cyril Conroy surprises his wife, Elna, by secretly buying and then giving to her the Dutch House, a mansion in Elkins Park, Philadelphia, so called because of its original owners (the VanHoeBeeks), whose huge portraits still hang in the house along with all their other possessions: Cyril didn't just buy the house, he bought everything in it.Elna hates it. She hates it a lot. She hates it enough to take some drastic actions.Many years later, Cyril and Elna’s children, Maeve and Danny make repeated trips to sit in a car outside the Dutch House and talk about its influence on their family. Danny is our narrator for this story that jumps around over a 50 year period and gradually reveals the history of the Conroy family (which I am not going to discuss here - read the book!).The non-linear timeline of the story keeps the reader alert. I have to acknowledge that there were times when it took me a few pages to work out exactly when I was reading about (I had a similar experience when reading Commonwealth: Patchett doesn’t date stamp all her sections and it can sometimes take a while to place them in the overall timeline. That’s not a complaint as it adds to the fun of reading).As we read Danny’s recollections of his family, we also begin to see that he is unsure about some of it. He tells the story of how he met Celeste, whom he went on to marry, but it quickly becomes apparent that Maeve has a different memory of that. At one point, Danny asks ”Do you think it is possible to ever see the past as it actually was?” and later he says”Oh, would that we had always lived in a world in which every man, woman and child came with a device for audio recording, still photography, and short films. I would have loved to have evidence more irrefutable than my own memory…”Not only is memory suspect, but learning new things changes both Maeve’s and Danny’s perceptions of the past. At one point, Maeve says”I’ve always had it in mind that I hated Fluffy, that she had hit you and she had slept with Dad, but it turns out I don’t hate her at all.”This uncertainty about memory added to the changing perceptions as truth is revealed leads to a feeling of shifting sands beneath the narrative. Patchett isn’t writing a story full of action and drama - it’s a family saga telling the story of a somewhat dysfunctional family - but she is writing a story that makes the reader wonder what else was going on behind the scenes.The writing here is very easy on the eye. Patchett writes with a lightness of touch and sensitivity of observation that makes the pages flow by. There are insightful comments about human nature that are dropped in so casually they almost slip by. It all feels very accomplished. I enjoyed it a lot.My thanks to Bloomsbury Publishing for an ARC via NetGalley."

If you like deep dives into character driven narratives, this one is for you. Definitely a slow burn, a lot like her previous Commonwealth (although I liked this one way better), this story reminded me of Ask Again, Yes and The Most Fun We Ever Had. A complex, dysfunctional family takes center stage, focusing on a brother/sister pair and following from a life-changing event in their younger years through adulthood. I loved these characters. I loved their authenticity and how real they felt to me. The only thing that would have made it any better was if I had listened to Tom Hanks narrate the audio - which I do plan to do sometime in the future!This book was MADE for reading with a cup of tea/hot cocoa/coffee on a long, lazy weekend. I wish I could read it again for the first time!"

Siblings Danny and Maeve live in the house for a short period of time, but they are drawn to it like sailors to sirens. The Dutch House (so named for the original owners that are Dutch) comes to represent the turn in the road for the brother and sister. Their mother hated the home. She abandons the kids when they are young. Their father remarries, but their father’s choice pits the children against their step-mother. This book swept me into the lives of Danny and Maeve and I like how real this relationship feels. This is the type of book that unfurls slowly and gives vignettes of the lives of the characters that then paint a full picture. I’m glad I finally got to this one."

Przedstawia doskonały portret rodzinnych powiązań, których samoistność wychodzi poza schematy świadomości. Tytułowy Dom Holendrów jest miejscem, które upodabnia do siebie wszystkie postacie z tej książki i chroni je przed wizją zapomnienia; jego ściany przechowują w sobie pokolenia niespokojnych dusz, a on sam jest żyjącym stworzeniem, które karmi się retrospektywną wizją świata. Dużo tutaj resentymentowania i dużo odmian ironii przeszłości, która droczy się z bohaterami tej powieści - jest w końcu manipulantką ludzkiej pamięci."

I loathed Bel Canto, but liked Commonwealth, so I wasn’t sure how this would go, but I freaking loved it! Beautifully painful yet painfully beautiful. It’s a family saga that feels so real it could be anyone, anywhere. I thought it was going to follow the evil stepmother trope, but it’s much more complex. It’s about Danny and Maeve and how they rely on each other and navigate the shit show that is life."

293,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10762842-nicole-r,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is my favorite genre of book. A genre that I have trouble defining. Contemporary fiction with multi-generational families that are just simply trying to get through life. Is that a genre? I say yes. And this is a standout amongst the crowd.Many people will say that the central character of The Dutch House is, not surprisingly, The Dutch House. A 1920s monstrosity build by a Dutch couple who made their money in tobacco then purchased by Cyril Conroy in the 1950s at a foreclosure sale. Cyril moves his wife and two children, Maeve and Danny, into the house and things begin to unravel. Many other people will say that the central character of The Dutch House is Danny. Our narrator and tour guide and we witness the unraveling--and survival--of the Conroy family. The mother leaves, Cyril remarries, and eventually Maeve and Danny grow into adulthood. And we see it all through Danny's eyes.But I say that the central character of The Dutch House is Maeve. She essentially raises Danny, she is his best friend, and his telling of the story always revolves around Maeve. And I cannot overstate how much I loved Maeve. I loved her and, maybe even more, I loved her and Danny's relationship. They were more than just siblings. They were each other's only family, best friend, constant relationship. I also hated characters too. Not that they were poorly written, but that they were wonderfully written and I was supposed to hate them. Both Danny's mother and step-mother were cruel, horrible, selfish people. I think I was maybe supposed to actually end up liking the mother, but I didn't. By the time this wonderful story came to a close, I didn't want it to end. I listened to the final chapters with tears in my eyes and the ending was about as close to perfect as I could have imagined. My only complaint is that I wanted more. I could have listened to another 10 hours of this story and devoured every second. After being completely let down by Commonwealth a few years ago, Patchett comes back with a vengeance, publishing my hands-down favorite of her books to date and restoring her to my good graces.Added bonus: Tom Hanks narrated the audiobook. I'll admit, it took me a few chapters for it to stop feeling like Woody from Toy Story was reading me the book, but he really was an excellent selection. And I wonder how she snagged him....Easily a Top 10 book this year."

Erzählt wird die Geschichte zweier Geschwister über fünf Jahrzehnte und mehrere Generationen hinweg - ich sage doch, familiär richtig ""satt"" ;) Maeve ist zu Beginn elf Jahre alt, ihr jüngerer Bruder Danny sechs. Sie wachsen mit ihrem Vater in einem riesigen, geschichtsträchtigem Gebäude auf, eben jenem Holländerhaus. Die Mutter hat die Familie verlassen - ihr Verschwinden wird über die Jahre immer wieder beherrschendes Thema bei den Geschwistern sein (ebenso wie das Haus).Ohne Mutter (dafür mit sehr liebevollem und schön gezeichnetem Personal) im Haus hat Maeve schon früh die Rolle der Beschützerin für ihren Bruder übernommen - eine Rolle, die sie im Laufe der Jahrzehnte immer wieder unterschiedlich interpretiert. Danny ist sich seiner Rolle und der seiner Schwester bewusst, und die enge Bindung und Loyalität der Geschwister zueinander stellt sich nicht immer als gänzlich konfliktfrei dar.Ich habe mich sehr gerne in diesem Setting aufgehalten. Die Geschichte plätschert nett dahin, und ich meine das ausschließlich positiv! Es gibt schon einige Gimmicks: Die Geschichte wird nicht gänzlich linear erzählt sondern springt zeitlich hier und dort, das Märchen-Thema von Hänsel und Gretel ist recht offensichtlich, aber dafür auch sehr charmant umgesetzt, es ist angenehm und interessant, mit Maeve und Danny zu ""altern"" und das Drama, die vielen tollen emotionalen Momente, können sich durchaus sehen lassen.Was mich bei diesem Buch letztlich besonders begeistert hat, war, dass es eine TOPP 1A herrlich hassenswerte böse Stiefmutter gibt. Hach, wie lange hatte ich keinen Charakter mehr, den ich so leidenschaftlich, mit so viel Hingabe, verachten und mental ausbuhen konnte. So was muss auch mal sein, und da hat Ann Patchett hier für mich 100% ins Schwarze getroffen."

I wasn't sure about this book, but having seen before where Tom Hanks narrates this book, it sounded more interesting and I decided to give it a try. This was an interesting story of a brother and sister who grow up in The Dutch House really find out who and what family is when they are adults. Having grown up only knowing their mother ran off, a mysterious nanny named Fluffy, a step-mother brought in who has no feelings toward them, a housekeeper and cook who are really more family than not, and a father who decides that questions unanswered are best. But after the death of their father, and being asked to leave the Dutch House, the only home they have ever know really, does Maeve and Danny really find out who their family is. After Maeve becomes ill do all these people come back into their lives and really show them, they were more family than they thought. That the Dutch House had more meaning to them than they even cared to admit.Tom Hanks brought so much life to this story, that it really made it interesting for me to listen.

Patchett puts as much care and color into her characters as an artist puts into each brushstroke of a painting. If you told me she also created the portrait of Maeve on the cover, I would believe you.There’s no great twists or action-packed plot, just wonderful writing about complicated family dynamics. So many times I was filled with anger or resentment that mirrored a character’s, and sometimes surpassing it. Only to, by the end of it all, have it evaporate away and leave me wondering why I felt so much. To those with your own familial tensions: expect to be confronted with them as well.It’s not a sad book; it’s sad the way life is. Or beautiful the way life is. Or unfair the way life is. I really didn’t mean to write such a melancholic review, but I guess this is where I ended up. But in case there’s any confusion, I recommend picking up The Dutch House.*Thanks to HarperCollins & Netgalley for an advance copy!"

I could not see the pages at times for the blind rage I felt at the mother. I think about Danny and how he was so self-involved, so unable to see anything, so neglectful of his wife and kids…just like his parents. He doesn’t break the cycle, we never break any cycles, and what I thought was a stilted and anticlimactic ending was probably just realistic.

So why only two stars?Because of two fatal flaws:1.. The main character was a male who never sounded like one. The thought patterns, internal dialogues, and even the way he arrived at conclusions were decidedly non-male. I am generalizing, of course. There are probably men out there who think/act this way. But if the main character was one of these outliers there should've been a way of understanding his uncommon behaviors.2. The house, which is supposed to be a character in and of itself, was boring and two-dimensional. Patchett spent a ton of pages describing it and how it affected its occupants over the years, but it was hard to see how something so blase could have such a lasting impact. Again, it was not convincing.It is always interesting to read the work of gifted writers. It's just that this one left me a bit flat."

But mostly, it is an analysis of a brother and sisters support for one another during a time of great upheaval and dismissal. I have never read this author before but I am going to check out more books by her now. The character development of this story is some of the deepest I have ever read while simultaneously keeping character motivations at arms length from the reader. It requires the reader to decipher a lot of character motivation through their decision making. I truly enjoyed the ending and may have experienced a small tear drop fall from my eye."

306,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16323644-amanda---mrs-b-s-book-reviews,Rating 4 out of 5,"*https://mrsbbookreviews.wordpress.com4.5 starsRespected American author Ann Patchett released her eighth novel in 2020. The Dutch House is a poignant story of humanity, relationships and family ties. A remarkable and meditative read, The Dutch House is a moving story for those who appreciate character focussed tales.Opening after the Second World War, we witness a family move from financial concern to economic stability as the patriarch of the Conroy family makes a business move that will change their lives forever. As a result, Cyril Conroy buys the Dutch House, a sprawling estate in the Philadelphia area. But the acquisition of this mansion will have far reaching implications for Cyril, his wife and his children for years to come. Narrated by Danny, Cyril’s son, we follow this family’s exploits as they deal with the ebbs and flows of life. Despite the setbacks and the difficulties this family faces, the two Conroy children forge a strong bond. The Dutch House spans over five decades, revealing much about the state of family relationships, sibling bonds, expectation, success, loyalty, abandonment, self-belief, confrontation, ire and protection.I’ve heard only good things about Ann Patchett, the author of The Dutch House so I was really looking forward to experiencing my first book this highly regarded writer. I chose to listen to The Dutch House on audiobook format via the candid storytelling approach of Tom Hanks, who was perfectly cast as the main narrator Danny. Although I loved this one on audiobook, I’m confident that the print or e-book version would be just as engaging as the Audible text.The Dutch House is a book you need to savour and tread lightly with. I’m glad I listened to this one over a longer stretch of time than usual and I wasn’t tempted to rush through. The Dutch House is heavy on everyday life musings. It is not a strong action-packed novel. Spanning over a number of decades, it was a blessing to follow Danny, his sister, wife and family through the sands of time. With Patchett’s introspective focus on character, each protagonist is presented at their very optimum thanks to Patchett’s skilled prose. This is a remarkable novel. The Dutch House definitely made its mark on me.Special mention needs to directed towards the Dutch House itself, a formidable building with a life of its own. Patchett’s detailed and descriptive word formation allows the reader to believe that they are an essential part of the walls of this memorable estate. I could easily picture the paintings, furniture and room space of this structure. Patchett is able to express the sense of place in The Dutch House perfectly. I also need to highlight the relationships interrogated in this novel. Patchett accurately portrays the complex relations between parents and their children, siblings and partners. Every human connection in The Dutch House is relayed with understanding, compassion, honesty and maturity. I’m just so glad to have finally connected to Ann Patchett’s brilliant writing."

310,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4691420-xueting,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5 starsI became a fan of Ann Patchett since reading Bel Canto, but the only other book by her I'd read is her memoir-essay collection, This is the Story of a Happy Marriage. The Dutch House is much lighter compared to Bel Canto but it also possesses a similar charm and sorta magical quality.This is a character-driven novel and a slow burn; there is a general plot, but it's pretty much established in the first quarter of the book, though I found it very intriguing. At the heart of the story is the relationship between our narrator Danny and his older sister Maeve, their fierce bond and how they take care of each other throughout their lives. We follow them through decades, from their childhood to their fifties. The Dutch House, a grand WWII-era mansion that the family moves into before Danny was born, is like a character because of how vividly it is described and also how significantly it impacts Danny and Maeve's lives. It has a big part to play in why and how their family is shaken up: their mother leaves them when they are just kids (it's a mystery why she leaves), and soon their stern father re-marries another woman who gradually begins to take over the house. What develops after that should be left to the reader to discover, so no spoilers!The writing is very rich in laying out the characters' psyche; all the major characters are complex and human, flaws and all. I just LOVE the storytelling and the narrative voice. It helps me get deeply invested in the characters, so I didn't mind the slower pace and little action. It's a wonderful and moving story about family, the bond between siblings, forgiveness, nostalgia, and how time and emotions colour our memories.I was completely engrossed and captivated by the first half. The second half, though, made me feel like there should be something more and deeper. Ann Patchett was trying to work in something about class and wealth in relation to Danny's family and their dysfunctionality, but she explored the issue on a pretty surface level. Class served more as a plot point than for social commentary. There's some passing talk about ""serving the poor"" and ~going to India~ to do so, and it all bordered on poverty porn and made me cringe. That's my main gripe, but it's a big and important one, so it affected my overall liking of the novel."

321,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55950556-elise-schiller,Rating 4 out of 5,"The Dutch House has some resemblance to a fairy tale, complete with a mother who disappears, a distant father who falls under the spell of a wicked stepmother, three kind servants who are like Cinderella’s mice, and a beautiful castle-home that acts as the structural center of the novel. Several of the key characters have the one dimensional nature of fairy tale figures—the mother, father, step-mother, and the unlikeable wife of the narrator. Fortunately, that narrator, Danny, is an interesting and complex character, especially when his narration is read in the audio version by Tom Hanks. Danny, who is the son of the household, narrates a story that spans many decades, from the disappearance of his mother when he is about three, to his middle age years. Through dialogue and information he gains from his older sister Maeve, the three servants, and other characters, he also fills in periods from before his birth, from the history of the Dutch House to the beginning years of his parents’ marriage. As a writer, I’m quite interested in why a novelist chooses a particular point of view to tell a story—how does the choice impact characterization, tone, and plot? One of the drawbacks of a first person narrator can be limitations on language, especially if that narrator is a young person. In this case, however, the “present” of the book is when Danny is about 50, so he is quite distanced from the significant early action of the novel which allows for sophisticated vocabulary and use of language without a lack of authenticity. If done well, a first person narrator can achieve intimacy and connection to the reader in a powerful way. The voice of Danny is warm, funny, and shrewdly observant, easily accessible to the reader. Unfortunately, first person point of view can also result in other characters appearing one-dimensional; after all, they can only be portrayed through the lens of the first person narrator. In The Dutch House I see this as a weakness, especially with Maeve, who is so significant to the story that she needs to be a fully realized character and Patchett falls short of that. We are never sure of Maeve’s real feelings and thoughts since they are all filtered through Danny and we suspect their mutual devotion promotes some protective lack of transparency on both sides. Both Maeve and Danny have been utterly abandoned both physically and emotionally and I would have liked a bit more understanding about how this plays into the life Maeve leads. One of Patchett’s significant achievements in this book is the ease with which her narrator moves back and forth in time seamlessly, a widening loop that pulls in new information each time to add to the picture. As Danny grows older he learns about his parents and Maeve’s early years through a variety of sources and we get to hear him processing how a new nugget adds to his understanding of his childhood. This provides mild propulsion that keeps the pace going. Ornate and odd, the house itself is beautifully realized. Its relevance varies from character to character, and it is worthy of each one’s relationship to it. What becomes of the house in the end is just and satisfying, even when we are left with questions about many of the characters. "
322,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18967379-bookphenomena-micky,Rating 3 out of 5,"THE DUTCH HOUSE was an epic family saga told over decades, detailing the level to which a family can be messed up. There was nothing predictable about this tale and overall the tone of the story was pretty sad and depressing. However, it was rich in characterisation and description.The story was told from the POV of Danny, at first a young boy, at the end in his fifties. Alongside, his sister Maeve, they navigated traumatic family events that initially revolved around their house (The Dutch House) and later away from the house. There was an amazing cast of side characters, my favourites of whom were Dr Able, Fluffy and Andrea (who doesn’t love a Cruella de Ville character).I spent various points in this book incensed on behalf of Maeve and Danny. Danny had all the potential as a young man to turn out differently from his father but as the book progressed, I did feel he became something of a self-centred cold fish and he definitely had shades of his father. I adored Maeve as a character, she was the rudder to this story and many of her story lines just plain hurt.It sounded so nostalgic when he said it, the three of us, as if we had once been a unit instead of just a circumstance.The return of Elna to the story was not welcome to me and I just knew that she wasn’t going to be great news despite the understandable glee of Maeve. The wrap up to Andrea was a little disappointing as well; these mothers were just awful.I am left reflecting on how much this book made me feel and how involved I became with this family despite my middling rating. I would definitely read Ann Patchett again because she creates such characters that you cannot help but get swept up by them.Thank you to Bloomsbury Publishing and Tandem Collective for the review copy.This review can be found on A Take From Two Cities Blog."
323,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28397995-nancy,Rating 5 out of 5,"Glowing reviews of Ann Patchett's newest novel The Dutch House impelled me to snatch it up as soon as it appeared on the new release shelf at the public library.The story of siblings Maeve and Danny Conroy whose mother disappears and is replaced by an evil stepmother is like a fairy tale, especially when after their father's death their stepmom exiles them from their home to fend for themselves. The abandoned children, like Hanzel and Gretel, have only each other.The story of family trauma and the inability to move on resolves into a kind of Howard's End moment, and it all centers on the Dutch House. The house is what divided the family. There are those who belong to the house, those who lust for it, those who love it, and those who desire it. Who controls the house is central to the novel.The Dutch House is a historic mansion in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania, built in 1922 as a country refuge for a wealthy Dutch family. WWII veteran Cyril Conroy was a frustrated architect who became a real estate tycoon. He bought the Dutch House and all its contents, planning to surprise his wife Elna.Elna was unable to accept a life of leisure, living in a mansion. Cyril had pulled her from a convent to be his wife, dividing her from the vocation that kept calling her back. Elna had to make a choice. It wasn't Cyril and her family.Andrea wanted the house, and married Cyril for the house--and Cyril married Andrea because she loved it as much as he did. The siblings bond with Andrea's young children. Andrea begins the process of disenfranchising Cyril's children, appropriating Maeve's bedroom for her own daughter.Upon Cyril's early death, the children learn that their father left Andrea his business, house, and money. Andrea proclaims that she never signed on to raise Danny and sends him to live with his Maeve.There are a few times in life when we leap up and the past you'd been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet in place, and for a moment you're suspended, knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself.~fron The Dutch House by Ann PatchettCyril left a trust fund for the children's education as well as Andrea's daughter's education. Maeve had already finished college and was ineligible, so she encouraged Danny to use up as much of the money as possible, attending private school and then going to medical school. Danny had dreamt of taking over his father's business; he loved repairing the buildings and the tenants. Maeve had planned on grad school but now had to support herself.The siblings held their anger and resentment close, a deep bond between them.We'd made a fetish out of our misfortune, fallen in love with it.~from The Dutch House by Ann PatchettDanny asks his sister, what kind of person leaves their kids? And Maeve replies,""Men! Men leave their children all the time and the world celebrates them for it. The Buddha left and Odysseus left and no none gave a shit about their sons. They set out on their noble journeys to do whatever the hell they wanted to do and thousands of years later we're still singing about it.""Each character in the book, including the caretaker's daughter who became Danny's nanny and the housemaid and cook, has a relationship to the Dutch House. It is the house that bonds them.I connected with the characters' attachment to a house; after moving as a girl, for years I hoped to grow up and be able to retrieve my first home for myself. I also appreciated how Elna's vocation disrupted her family life; I have seen several clergy marriages crushed by the conflict of family vs. pastoral obligations. Danny and Maeve embrace unhealthy ways of coping with the past, which makes them unlikeable to some readers. (Also, we lived near Elkins Park, our son born in the hospital there!)Patchett has given us another fantastic book, filled with memorable characters. "

It's about this family and Family. It's about getting stuck in time and, perhaps, attempting to get unstuck. It's about making sense of the failings of the people we love (or don't). Dutch House is a quiet book – much of it taking place in a car in front of the Dutch House, as Maeve and Danny attempt to come to terms with their parents. Yet, it isn't a slow book on any level. I read it in a day and a half and wanted to swallow it whole. As in the books I like best, I've been savoring it as it lingers on my ""tongue,"" thinking about these strong, wounded people well after closing my kindle. Danny spins their story out in present tense over 40ish years, winding back on himself (still in the present), telling us more, and then occasionally discovering a new ""door"" that changes the meaning of everything. Although some narrators deliberately deceive, Danny tells everything he knows at that point in time as he attempts to make sense of the past. He wonders, do we see the past as it was or do we see it through our current, much different eyes? To what extent are our stories about a person dependent on how we feel about them? Or perhaps we choose events that support our favorite narrative, while ignoring others? As Danny observed, The truth is I have plenty of memories of [our stepmother] being perfectly decent. I just choose to dwell on the ones in which she wasn’t” (Kindle 990).Although everyone agreed that Danny and Maeve's stepmother was awful, how do you make sense of a ""sainted"" mother, as several characters described her, if she abandoned you when you were four? We don't have language that makes sense of such an act – it certainly doesn't fit with my culture's motherhood myths. Johnson & Johnson, for example, says ""Having a baby changes everything,"" and their advertisements are all sweetness and joy. There is no story of the prodigal mother. The rich man didn’t call for a banquet to celebrate the return of his erstwhile wife. The sons, having stuck it out for all those years at home, did not hang garlands on the doorways, kill the sheep, bring forth the wine. When she left them she killed them all, each in his own way, and now, decades later, they didn’t want her back. They hurried down the road to lock the gate, the father and his sons together, the wind whipping at their coats. A friend had tipped them off. They knew she was coming and the gate must be locked. (Kindle 3600)Danny and Maeve's mother left them without saying good-bye, but their father abandoned them in a much more conventional way. He was able to do so while avoiding most of their wrath. What's that about?“Men leave their children all the time and the world celebrates them for it. The Buddha left and Odysseus left and no one gave a shit about their sons. They set out on their noble journeys to do whatever the hell they wanted to do and thousands of years later we’re still singing about it. Our mother left and she came back and we’re fine. We didn’t like it but we survived it. I don’t care if you don’t love her or if you don’t like her, but you have to be decent to her, if for no other reason than I want you to."" (Kindle 4077)Dutch House is a lovely book; nonetheless, I would have bought it just for the cover. I recently read a review about a book where the reviewer commented that the cover had nothing to do with the book. Not so in this case. This painting plays an important role.I read this book with my mother and her book club. Thank you for the recommendation!"

In this case, it is the family home where the narrator, Danny, and his sister Maeve grew up. The house is somewhere outside of Philadelphia, where their father, Cyril, builds his fortune as a landlord and property developer. Their mother, Elna, abandons the family when the children are young, taking off for India. She hated the house, and she had a deep wish to help others. The theme of a parent who spends most or all of their time and energy helping others while neglecting their own family is compelling. I remembered a friend from high school who was resentful that her father (there were 8 children) spent much of his free time doing work with the Knights of Columbus. I have met other parents in my adult life who leave their children to “do good work” , often in faraway places. As a mother, I never understood this. There are references to Elna as a saint. No one ever asks about the children she left (perhaps her admirers don’t know). Her rational to Danny and Maeve when they finally find her when they are middle-aged, was that the children were materially comfortable, and lacked for nothing. She completely ignored their need for the love and presence of a mother. Her husband divorced her (he had someone deliver divorce paperwork to her as she disembarked in India) and quickly remarried. Their stepmother, Andrea, is a cold, and yes, evil woman, who arrived with two children.When Cyril dies, in his mid-50’s, Maeve is living in New York. Andrea quickly orders Danny and Maeve out of the house, sending Danny to live with Maeve. She claims everything their father owned, and the only funds available are for Danny’s education. Danny is enrolled in boarding school, thanks to the family lawyer who is appalled at Andrea’s actions. The siblings spend the following years resenting Andrea, and mourning the loss of the Dutch House.Danny studies medicine and becomes a doctor, but his heart is in following in his father’s footsteps as a property developer. He is portrayed as a gentile gentrifier. As he moved into Harlem, buying up property in a calculated way, I couldn’t help but think of the tremendous losses that this gentrification has meant for the African American community of Harlem. Inevitably, the character of many neighborhoods that “charmed” some incomers (the first are often artists), is eradicated, forever. https://www.humanityinaction.org/know...Danny marries and has a daughter, May. This the story includes three generations, and the Dutch House remains part of the family history and legacy.I listened to the audiobook and was initially unsure if Tom Hanks was the right choice. He has such a “homey” approach, and the story of the Dutch House covers some painful themes including child abandonment, and a merciless stepmother. But Hanks won me over and in the end, I thought he was perfect."

Granted I have not read Bel Canto and I really should get to that sooner rather than later.In this novel, the protagonist is a man named Danny but it could be argued that the real protagonist is The Dutch House in the title as it does assume an outsize importance in the lives of the people who have lived there.Danny, abandoned by his mother before he has any memory of her, cleaves to his sister Maeve who assumes that mothering role. His distant father shapes him in ways he doesn’t realize but also fails to protect him and leaves him at the mercy of his stepmother. In fact, this book could be subtitled, Failure to Take Care of Your Children.There is an underlying theme of forgiveness and a feeling that things are righted in the end and yet I can’t help feeling disenfranchised on Danny’s behalf which only proves Patchett’s talent…..she can write sympathetic characters."

Although Cyril purchased their palatial mansion known as the Dutch House for his wife, she hated its opulence. Although Maeve was only seven years older than Danny, she assumed a maternal role to her younger brother with the assistance of a cook, housekeeper and nanny. Several years after Elna left, a young widow, Andrea, who is enthralled with the house, finangles herself in to marriage and she and her two daughters move into the Dutch House. Danny is the protagonist of this character-study with much of the plot focused on the relationship between the two siblings, who are the two characters best fleshed out. You quickly discern that the brother and sister care deeply about each other. The novel follows the two lives almost chronologically with a few time shifts back and forth. I never found any of this distracting.The Dutch House could be a third character in this novel. Like moths to a flame, the two have a fetish-like relationship with the edifice. Their fond memories growing up in the Dutch House is replaced with pining when two two are driven from the mansion. Ann Patchett is one of favorite authors. Her book Bel Canto continues to be one of my lifetime favorite books. If you can, I would recommend that you pick up the audiobook of this novel since the actor Tom Hanks narrates it and brings Danny's character alive. Although this book is not as loved as Bel Canto for me, I really did enjoy it."

The Dutch House is a mature story about imperfect children surviving neglectful parents, and it is splendid. As a reader, you feel like the narrator, Danny, is your brother, and you love him; you feel like his older sister, Maeve, is your sister, and you love her, too. You feel like their antagonistic stepmother, Andrea, is yours, and you are held on the edge of your seat waiting for her comeuppance. Andrea is obsessed with their beautiful house, is money hungry, and is utterly lacking in maternal instincts: “‘It must be a comfort, having them with you,’ Andrea said to him, not of his children but of his paintings” (p. 4). The anchor in Danny and Maeve’s family is a stunning, three-story house that is built on farmland, has a ballroom on the third floor, has remarkable paintings and woodwork throughout, and has a window-structure that renders the happenings inside transparent to the world. This house influences everyone’s lives in complex, divergent, and frequently deleterious ways: “Look at the three of us, undone by a house” (p. 305). Although Danny and Maeve’s biological parents fail miserably in family life, neither is wicked or immoral, and both are realistic examples of how well-intentioned humans can fall short. “The only thing our father really cared about in life was his work: the buildings he built and owned and rented out” (p. 18).“There is no story of the prodigal mother” (p. 264). One of the most entertaining parts of the story is the revenge strategy that Maeve and Danny embark on against their stepmother. What it entails, who it connects them with (“Who knew a chemistry book could act as bait for pretty girls?” p. 144), and how it affects their lives and those of their stepsisters, all comes together seamlessly, providing a perfectly-paced and flawlessly-executed scaffolding for the adult portion of the siblings’ story. “You don’t have to be a doctor, you only have to study to be one … You can be anything you want, as long as it requires a great deal of schooling” (p. 153). 1) Story (5/5) 2) Writing (5/5)3) Originality (4/5)4) Characters (5/5)5) Set pieces (4/5)6) Suspense (5/5)7) Ending (5/5)8) Relationships (romantic or otherwise) (5/5)9) Dialogue (5/5)"

351,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25777210-callum-mclaughlin,Rating 2 out of 5,"Upon the death of their father, siblings Danny and Maeve are exiled from their family home by their stepmother, Andrea. We follow them across several decades that follow, as they try and fail to move on with their lives.Patchett’s prose is pleasant enough and easy to read, and in that respect, this at least never felt like a chore to get through. If you’re willing to pick it apart, there are probably some interesting ideas in here concerning family, privilege, inheritance, and fate. The trouble is, I never felt invested enough to bother analysing it for any depth beyond the largely vapid and stereotype-ridden narrative. The author was clearly going for a fairy tale-vibe with the setup, but the wronged siblings and wicked stepmother tropes contribute nothing when they go entirely unexplored. Indeed, I found all of the characters frustratingly one dimensional.The handling of the female characters was particularly poor. This would bother me in any read, but a novel written by a woman that has been longlisted for the Women’s Prize for Fiction? I definitely expected better. All of the women (Maeve, Andrea, the children’s mother, the staff at The Dutch House, and Danny’s wife) all exist and operate almost exclusively in relation to Danny. Perhaps this was a deliberate attempt to criticise how oblivious men are to the sacrifices women make to ease their lives, but if so, I shouldn’t have to reach to make that conclusion; there should be enough depth in Danny’s narration to make use of such a nuanced theme. Beyond this, Danny’s wife and sister come to detest each other for no apparent reason, and this irritating trope of pitting women against each other also goes entirely unexplored.As for Andrea, there is no light and shade to her character, nor is there any context given to suggest why she is such a cartoonishly cruel stepmother. She is placed in contrast with Danny and Maeve’s largely absent birth mother, who, despite effectively abandoning her children, is repeatedly excused within the narrative since she is a ‘good’ and ‘Saintly’ person, off doing worthwhile charity work in India. Utilising such starkly opposite archetypes felt like lazy shorthand for character development on both fronts. I also found the end of Andrea’s arc incredibly problematic. ***Slight spoiler warning for the rest of this paragraph, though I would say the novel isn’t particularly plot driven anyway.*** Andrea ends up suffering from Alzheimer’s, becoming frail, bedridden, and confused. If this was a push to incite sympathy for the character by supposedly adding another dynamic to her characterisation, it fails, as in no way does it explain or justify her prior behaviour. If, instead, it’s supposed to be some sort of comeuppance or poetic justice, it’s nothing short of tasteless.The characters also act in absurd ways on several occasions. With all of them lacking discernible motivation, rational thought, and relatable outlooks, they never feel believable beyond the confines of the story. As such, I found it impossible to root for – or even care about – any of them.The book is supposedly set in the aftermath of WWII, but aside from occasional historic references that actually served to jolt me out of the narrative more than anything, a sense of time and place are almost entirely absent. Again, this may have been a deliberate move to lend the story a timeless feel – a trait often inherent to fairy tales – or it could simply be another flaw in the book’s construction. Either way, I found it odd and disappointing; an evocative setting could have really elevated things somewhat, especially given the importance of the eponymous Dutch House.In general, I found the whole thing flat and directionless, but the many rave reviews elsewhere suggest others will get on a lot better with it than I did. Patchett’s style is clearly not for me, and I won’t be in a hurry to pick up more of her work."

353,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5873473-darryl-suite,Rating 4 out of 5,"FINAL REVIEW: Disclaimer: This review is melodramatic. Do I apologize for it? Nope.The Dutch House comes off in the manner of a Victorian novel, there’s something very old fashioned about the writing. Even the plot, mood, setting, and characterizations seem inspired by the flair of classic literature. That was the first thing that struck me, and my love for the book was immediate because of it. This novel is about a middle class family’s relationship to The Dutch House, the old mansion they call home. This novel was caressing my book-loving soul, everything was going so well; I was getting excited: could it be? Could it be that this book would top the perfection of her previous novel Commonwealth? Oh my, it just might, I could cry...and then Part 3 happened. Oh heavens, Part 3.An event occurs during this section that shifts the tone of the story, and like a petulant child, I kept bellowing: “Are you serious? No one would ever react this way. No way, no way, no way.” I recognize that The Dutch House is a piece of fiction, but the characters’ actions and decisions felt totally unbelievable to me. The moment was supposed to be life-altering, and a character acted as if they were told their shoelaces were untied. Sadly, because of this moment (or non-moment), the book started to fall apart right before my disbelieving eyes. Heavens no, heavens no. I guess what I'm saying is this: in order for The Dutch House to fully work for you, you need to fully believe in these plot points. If you believe in them, the rest of the book will be very rewarding. As for me, the book lost me at this point.Despite this, I did like the book. Even though there are plot points I didn’t agree with and motivations that seemed for lack of a better word, random, I still walked away in awe of Patchett’s talent. The writing style is smooth as freshly churned butter (I’m laying it on thick). Despite my pettiness, Patchett proves that she is a master of the written word.https://www.instagram.com/p/B_S2A6xAF..."

And still I got a wonderful feeling after finishing it...It depends on narrator how he or she presents the story to us... And there is the Ann Patchett's credibility of weaving the this story with simplicity but in very graceful way.. Patchett is not new as a writer but I have felt a freshness in her writing throughout the book...And just like an artist she drew every character so carefully and gave them a appropriate color... No great twist and turn, no mystery, the plot is simple with amazing writing which depicts family relationships, the bond between sister (Maeve) and brother ( Danny) centered with the house where they lived once and after that they were exiled from there, memories of these two siblings ...,how the house made their mother to left them behind in very early age, how the house made impact on their growing up life, on their expectations , career, job and daily life too..There is a humor, there is a crisis , there is a hope, and there is lesson ...If you haven't read any Patchett yet, then I will suggest to give her writing a try with this book, and of course if you wanted to read something simple yet Amazing story-telling with best narration then definitely it is the great choice to read ...Though lil bit slow pace writing ( In part 2 specially) and few jumping between time lines make me give it less than 5 star...My Rating 4.4/5#thedutchhouse #annpatchett #bookreview"

I am a sucker for family dramas, and this one exceeded all my expectations, especially because the audio version was read by TOM HANKS. Can Tom Hanks read all audio books always?! He exquisitely captured the spirit of the book and of narrator Danny, who tells the decades long story of his family, but more precisely, of his sister Maeve, who is so beautifully captured in the cover art. This truly is a must listen, and one of my all time favorite audio books. The lives of the Conroy family are forever changed when they move into ""The Dutch House"" outside Philadelphia, and Danny and Maeve are ultimately left to fend for themselves (without spoiling any story lines), with Maeve essentially becoming a mother figure to Danny as they navigate decades of life and often return to The Dutch House. The story so beautifully comes full circle that I actually had chills in the last few minutes of the audio. My first Ann Patchett book was the most tremendous success! She writes with the subtlety of a world class musician or athlete who makes the craft look easy. I hope everyone decides to read (or LISTEN!) to this book. I had fun with the cover of this book over on Instagram here: https://www.instagram.com/jules.buono/"

Ann Patchett, that’s who!This book was horrible. Everything from the writing (almost a full page of the narrator contemplating the chance of taking a certain train at a certain moment because of a certain mishap blah blah blah we’ve all read this before so many times) to the fact that not once could I picture the time period (it was supposed to span decades, I guess), the house, or the narrator (who felt very female to me though the first part). And of course there’s the fact that a large portion of the book was set in the Philly area and the author clearly had no idea about the Philly area. She said in an interview that all those northern towns run together for her and she wouldn’t want to write about a place she knows ‘too well.’ So basically I hated it and now have a pretty low opinion of the author. Two stars because I made myself plod all the way to the thoroughly predictable end. "

Some even call this one a ""masterpiece."" Hmmmm.Now, still in the minority, I'm going to step out on a gangplank in saying that I really didn't like Tom Hanks reading this book, nor his narrating style. Don't get me wrong, as much as I absolutely ADORE Tom Hanks [as an actor], I feel like the only reason I should be listening to an audiobook read by him is if it's his autobiography... particularly since it's read in first-person. I've listened to numerous audiobooks read by well-known actors and actresses, but this one I just couldn't past the distinctive voice of Tom, not Danny.For me, 
The Dutch House
 was ok, but not WOW. I didn't feel like I really cared about the characters at the end, an ending which I felt was ho hum. I liked how some of the relationships came full circle at the end in a good way, Brother Danny and sister Maeve's relationship was interesting and the writing was good.

It’s safe to say that The Dutch House was not written for me. I had quite high expectations going in as I’ve heard so much praise for the novel and both the description and cover really intrigued me, but I was sadly very disappointed. Although I’ve finished the book, I still cannot seem to describe what it’s about. It focuses on a highly dysfunctional family and the strange people who live in the house...If an author isn’t going to have a strong plot, I NEED to feel deeply engaged with the characters in order to enjoy it. I couldn’t connect with any of the characters in the novel, and the rambling nature of the narrator did not help the situation. I certainly would have given a higher rating if there was a major plot twist or any shocking shift of events, but it just never came. The book dragged on and I’m honestly shocked I took the time to finish this. Overall, this was a painfully boring read that felt quite shallow and childish, and a sad waste of some real potential! "

It’s an emotional family saga that spans a generation between the 2 main characters, a brother and a sister. One could argue the house was the third main character. Many themes are addressed: unique kinship between siblings, inheritance, dysfunctional family, loss of loved ones, life expectations, the haunting of the past and ultimately, forgiveness. The story didn’t drag and all the characters were well developed. The latter part of the book through the ending continuously surprised me, yet tied things together; highlighting Ann Patchett’s skilled writing.Standout Excerpts: “We had made a fetish out of our misfortune, fallen in love with it. I was sickened to realize we kept it going for so long, not that we had decided to stop.”“There would never be an end to all the things I wished I’d asked my father. After so many years I thought less about his unwillingness to disclose and more about how stupid I’d been not to try harder.”"

Most importantly, never underestimate the power of forgiveness and letting go of old resentments. Tom Hanks was an absolute delight as narrator and one of my favorite actors since way back to his days on the sitcom 'Bosom Buddies'. Thought extra fondly of him during this time as he was one of the unfortunates who contracted COVID-19 early on, and wish him the best.Ann Patchett is always a joy, and I relish all her novels.

I think Ann Patchett has a wonderful way of building a world through layered stories and moving back and forth in time. This novel, however, really dragged for me. It felt like most of it was spent in an endless loop of the characters' obsession with their childhood home and everything that had happened. I get that the endless loop was part of their experience of not being able to move past childhood resentments, but as a reader I wanted a stronger sense that the novel was moving toward something. The best part of this novel is the last quarter when it starts to pick up momentum."

This defining event somehow provides momentum and urgency to the story so that even when life is ordinary the reader is compelled to keep turning the pages..In The Dutch House two siblings keep returning to sit outside the house of their childhood, the idyllic house where everything went wrong. Through all their troubles it is this central relationship that holds their lives on course. Patchett's exploration of character and her understanding of the human psyche is one of the joys of reading her work, as is the surprising ways in which she resolves her plot. Her characters are very relatable, yet never ordinary and I like the way she takes on the voice of a male protagonist. What an enjoyable book!"

Kažkodėl patraukė dėmesį tas mergaitės portretas ir tie paukščiai, ir net pats pavadinimas – „Olandiškas namas“. Ir pataikiau. Šitas romanas kaip tik toks, koks ir viršelis. Lyg jaukus, bet kartu ir šaltas, įtraukiantis, bet niūrus. Vietomis mielas, vietomis atgrasus. Iš esmės – pasaka apie Jonuką ir Gretutę. Pagrindinis veikėjas ir pasakotojas Danny užauga keistomis sąlygomis. Jo tėvas, buvęs skurdžius, po karo netikėtai žiauriai praturtėja iš nekilnojamojo turto ir su žmona ir dviem vaikais įsikrausto į milžinišką, ekscentrišką, nepaprastai prabangų išmirusios olandų turtuolių šeimos namą. Su visais tos šeimos daiktais (ta prasme net plaukais apsivėlusiu šepečiu, papuošalais, paveikslais...) Denio motina niekaip negali pritapti tame ekstravagantiškame name ir pabėga. Ji taip siaubingai ten jaučiasi, namas ją spaudžia taip, kad ji pasirenka geriau palikti savo vaikus, negu likti jame. Danny ir jo vyresnioji sesuo Maeve lieka su šaltu, tolimu tėvu ir tarnaitėmis didžiuliame, mįslingame name. Name, dėl kurio juos paliko mama. Netrukus į jų gyvenimą ateina piktoji pamotė...Romanas apima vos ne visą Denio gyvenimą. Kaip jis augo name, apie jo nepaprastai artimus ir sudėtingus santykius su seseria, su tėvu ir pamote. Pateikiama visa perspektyva, kaip jį paveikė tėvo šaltis ir motinos nebuvimas, kaip išsirutuliojo jo ir sesers gyvenimai po vaikystėje ištikusių netekčių. Romane daug froidiškų kompleksų, įdomiai, nors vietomis ir banalokai nagrinėjamas brolio ir sesers / vyro ir žmonos santykis. Namas veikia kaip atskiras veikėjas, tarytum jis būtų kaltas dėl visų šeimos negandų. Tačiau Denis su Meive į jį sugrįžta kiekviename knygos skyriuje, sėdi priešais jį mašinoje ir kalbasi apie vaikystę, žiūrėdami į tą namą bando aiškintis savo gyvenimo prasmę. Kaip Jonukas su Gretute jie vis grįžta pas pamotę raganą, į saldainių namelį, kuris iš pažiūros toks dailutis ir skanutis, toks viliojantis, tačiau iš tiesų yra pražūtingas. Romanas kiek snobiškas, vietomis nuobodokas, jam apibūtinti tinka angliškas žodis „pretentious“. Nrpliojami vyrų ir moterų santykiai dažnai (ko gero sąmoningai) pateikiami seksistiškai (na, aišku didžioji dalis veiksmo vyksta 60s-70s), bet tas mane bet kokiu atveju nervina. Tačiau suprantu, čia dalis to psichologinio žvilgnsio – kaip vyras žiūri į moterį, kai yra užaugęs be motinos ir beveik be tėvo ir vienintelė jo atrama vyresnioji sesuo... Žodžiu, kyla visokių minčių, knyga tikrai ne plokščia, yra ir ką pagalvot ir jausmus sudrumsčia.Duodu 4 žvaigždes ir skaitysiu kitus autorės romanus! Rekomenduoju kol kas originalo kalba, bet gal leidyklos susidomės išversti?... O ką jūs jos skaitėt ir (ne)rekomenduojat?"

The main characters of Maeve and Danny are obviously traumatised by the disappearance of their mother. The reasons being only obscurely referred to by the author, ""she didn't like the house"".History has a knack of sometimes going full circle. So it is for Danny and Maeve Conroy. The story is narrated by Danny, the son of a successful investor of residential properties. As a young child his mother disappears and for which his sister Maeve being older than him suffers more from the disappearance of their mother. The father initially is distant towards his children who are mainly cared for by the staff, Fiona (Fluffy) who has been part of the house since the original Dutch owners with Sandy and Jocelyn hired by the children's mother. In due course the father marries again to a woman who seems more in love with the Dutch House and it's potential than her husband. Andrea brings with her two daughters Norma and Bright and as most happens more often than not begins to have her daughters take precedence over Maeve and Danny. The personalities of Maeve and Danny are direct opposites, Maeve is feisty and not afraid of speaking her mind while Danny at first appears as little boy lost, he is compliant, aware of his father's moods. The two have a strong attachment which becomes more and more intense as they grow older even after Danny marries and has a loving wife. As the family history moves on, the father dies leaving everything to Andrea with the exception of an Educational Trust and from this Maeve pushes Danny into his Medical Degree in order to use all the Trust money so as to deny Andrea's daughters such an education. Danny having no desire to practice medicine and with the obscure training from his father begins a similar business investment journey. From out of the blue with a health crises involving Maeve their mother returns. This puts Danny at odds with the relationship of mother and daughter. This is understandable, he has had a very close relationship with Maeve and almost overnight there is a change in the dynamics. For a long time Maeve has had an obsession with the Dutch House and becomes a voyeur of events that take place there even knowing the time of night when the lights will be put on.It's not until the end that the courage to reenter the house reveals the final twist regarding Andrea and Norma. Danny realises that all he harboured he has to let go."

Then I saw on Instagram that the audiobook was narrated by none other than THE Tom Hanks!! When I saw that it was available to listen to on Scribd I immediately pressed the ""start listening"" button!! I could listen to Tom Hanks talk forever, and the way he performed the narration was like listening to one of his award winning films!! Other than loving Tom Hanks as an actor, narrator, and simply as a human...I truly enjoyed this story very much! It had somewhat of a slow start and build up, and at times I didn't really know where the plot was leading. The plot structure was curious but also in a way, fun! I didn't expect going in, to get as deeply attached to the characters as I did by the end. I also didn't expect to feel emotional when I realized the story was over. The main focal point of this book is a beautiful sibling relationship, which has grown so strong by the fact that their mother left them at a young age, to be ""raised"" by their apathetic father. The main setting which the book is named after is the Dutch style house in which they grow up in. This house was used as a fascinating setting, metaphor and paradox. I found it deeply compelling, how Ann Patchett used The Dutch house itself almost as its own character. It has a different affect on each character, making for a very unique affect on the reader as well. Although this isn't the best book I've ever read/listened to, I would easily recommend it!! The plot did feel aimless in places, but it's following a person's life path, which can be irresolute at times. This book is a wonderful testament to the bond between siblings and parents. (I would definitely be interested in re-reading it physically!)"

Κατά την γνώμη μου, οι χαρακτήρες του βιβλίου ήταν άψυχοι και αδιάφοροι και η ιστορία δεν σου έδινε λόγους για να διαβάσεις παρακάτω. Η τριτοπρόσωπη αφήγηση με έκανε απλά να βλέπω την υπόθεση από απόσταση και να μην ""ζω"" τα γεγονότα (εν αντιθέσει με άλλα βιβλία που έχω διαβάσει που παρά την τριτοπρόσωπη αφήγηση, καταφέρνουν να σε κάνουν ένα με την ιστορία). Δυστυχώς, δεν συμπάθησα τους ήρωες του βιβλίου ούτε και δέθηκα με κάποιον από αυτούς συναισθηματικά. Με ενόχλησαν τα συχνά πισωγυρίσματα στον χρόνο με αποτέλεσμα να υπάρχει σύγχυση σχετικά με το αν τα όσα διάβαζα εκείνη τη στιγμή αναφέρονταν στο παρόν ή το παρελθόν. Ακόμη, το γεγονός ότι κάποια γεγονότα έσκαγαν σα βόμβα και αναφέρονταν συνοπτικά αντί να αναλυθούν ήταν για μένα ένα τεράστιο φάουλ της συγγραφέως, μια προσπάθεια να επισπεύσεις ανεπιτυχώς τα γεγονότα και τη ροή της ιστορίας γενικότερα. Θα μπορούσε, ωστόσο, να πει κανείς (και το αναγνωρίζω) ότι ο πιο ενδιαφέρον, ίσως, χαρακτήρας του βιβλίου ήταν η μητέρα, η Έλνα, καθώς υπήρχε ένα μυστήριο γύρω από το όνομά της ήδη από την αρχή της ιστορίας και λόγω του χαρακτήρα της κατάφερε να γίνει αγαπητή στο κοινό. Η γραφή της ιστορίας δεν με εντυπωσίασε, ούτε και θεωρώ ότι είχε κάτι το αξιοθαύμαστο. Τη βρήκα άψυχη και με κύριο γνώμονα την παράθεση γεγονότων κι όχι την εμβάθυνση σε αυτά. Έλλειψη πλοκής.

How to even summarize it, let alone draw out a few succinct thoughts? She has such a way with writing families, capturing the way the people closest to you can be simultaneously blind to who you are and yet intimate enough to shatter you.So - what is this novel about? It's about the Dutch House, a beautiful museum of a house with unique architecture (a ballroom on the third floor, a starry sky on the dining room ceiling, a glass hallway that creates a line of sight from one end of the house to the other). It's about a man who buys the house for his wife as a surprise, and what the house comes to represent to each of the characters. Because the house always stays the same, it lets Patchett play with ideas like memory and childhood perception.What also made this a really moving read for me were the ways the story mirrored my own life (No, I didn't grow up in a museum). I had to put it down several times, especially in the beginning: it's intense, it's heartbreaking and visceral. I think much of the power of this story comes from how Patchett destroys everything at the beginning, shows her characters working through grief and unimaginable loss, and brings them out the other side.Read this one for gripping literary fiction with themes about growing up and through."

It will certainly be in my top reads of 2019. I loved it! I can hardly put my thoughts into words. It was one of those books that a fellow reader described as a ""rare literary page-turner "". I couldn't agree more. It is an expertly crafted book featuring complex characters, including a majestic house, whose story is formed through a complicated family history, a dynamic sibling relationship and nostalgia. I absolutely adored the way Patchett incorporated the power of memory. How these seemingly small snippets of time shape who we become and even more importantly, how we remember them. As a Mom I wonder what my kids will remember when they look back on their childhood. I've come to the conclusion that it won't be the big things- it will be these small, impressionable moments. Those moments that I couldn't plan for even if I tried.*sigh* I loved this book.

He read it with the right amount of passion, humour, and emotion. You don't go into a Patchett expecting a major plot. Her study of character and the ability to translate it onto paper is incredible. That is what you find here in The Dutch House 100%. I actually teared up when I was around 75% of the way through it.

Sometimes we cannot move past our past, and this book wonderfully explores themes of family, of love and loss, of sibling bonds, of class and memory. I was sucked in from the first line and loved every minute of it. When I closed the book I felt like I knew and cared about these people. I listened to the audiobook which was wonderfully narrated by Tom Hanks. He had some quirks that reminded me it was Hanks, but he captured the voice of Danny really well. If you are in the mood for a slow burn family tale, I'd highly recommend this one."

Very enjoyable, I often thought about the characters and the story when I wasn’t reading it and was really looking forward to picking up where I had left off and finding out more about Danny and Maeve and how their lives pan out. I thought it was great the way the house was just as pivotal a character as anyone else. In fact, when you think about it, the house was probably the most important aspect of the whole story. It brought everyone together, tore them apart, then reunited them and brought a measure of peace and reconciliation. I wanted more of Maeve’s story, I know it was told from Danny’s perspective so we had more of his POV but his sister was the glue that held everything together. Also, I did feel that everything fell into place a little too neatly in the end otherwise I would have given it 5 stars."
384,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/263948-sara,Rating 5 out of 5,"I've always loved Ann Patchett's emotional intelligence and the depth of her characters' emotional lives. She's amazing at writing about all the nuances in human relationships and how they affect people. It's so hard to see the good in people after they've hurt you, to hold two warring parties close to you without taking sides, to have a close relationship with someone who is neglectful or abusive to someone else who you love. The Dutch House  doesn't have your stereotypical formulaic plot and I'd have a hell of a time explaining what it's really about, but I can say that I miss the main characters Danny and Maeve already and I know I will think of them often in the years to come."

Sometimes I think “I could write a book, can’t be that hard,” but then I read something as well-crafted as this and... NOPE. The audiobook is narrated by Tom Hanks, and I can’t decide if that enhanced my enjoyment or detracted from it. You never quite forget who you’re listening to. Because of this, I’d like to revisit The Dutch House in print form at some point. Also of note, this book isn’t really about anything Dutch. It’s kind of a misleading title. "

It may be Ann Patchett's style; I haven't read any of her work before. The two main characters have been locked out of their own lives or believe that they have been - fortunately for them, there was a trust fund. I read this entirely because it was longlisted for the Women's Prize -- I am compulsively reading that Longlist during social distancing/lockdown. It was worth a read."

Before I listened to this audiobook I would not have thought of Tom Hanks as a great audiobook narrator, but his voice is perfect for this story. There was an unexpected scene toward the end that made me laugh so hard that tears came out of my eyes (which rarely happens when I read or listen to novels). This book is a five stars for me. 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩"

Maeve Conroy, her brother Danny and their father occupied the space of The Dutch House with their workers. Their mother hated the Dutch House. Maeve took over their mother's role taking care of Danny. Then without warning, their father brings home Andrea Smith who finagles her way into their home with her two daughters. Their father's behavior was odd, and his life was all about his work.After Maeve and Danny's father suddenly passes away from a heart attack, Andrea, the evil stepmother, kicks Danny out of the house to live with Maeve, not caring about what would become of them. Maeve was diabetic. There is something so endearing and emotional about Danny's narrative throughout this story. He meets Celeste on a train as he headed home for Thanksgiving. Maeve didn't like Celeste, and Celest didn't like Maeve. Celeste and Danny dated, eventually got married and had children. They later divorced after Maeve passed away.This book, narrated by Danny, shows a sometimes quirky and rather clueless side of him. His sister Maeve is his heart, and when his mother returns one day, after all of the hardships they endured as children, he doesn't forgive her, but Maeve does. Even as he learned that his mother had been taking care of underserved people all these years in the same city they lived in, he doesn't care because she left them when they needed her. Maeve had taken on the role of Danny's mother figure. She forgave her mother and yearned for her when her mother appears after decades of being absent from their lives. This reappearance surfaces when Maeve becomes ill. After Maeve passes away, I felt sorry for Danny. Home is so sad. After all of the years since they were kicked out of The Dutch House, Maeve and Danny pretended that what they had lost was the house, not their mother, or their father."

Maeve Conroy and her brother Danny grew up in the VanHoebeek mansion outside of Philadelphia. Their home was beautiful, but at a young age they lost their mother and were rejected by their step mother. Both were bright and moved ahead, forging successful lives. But tragedies continued. Danny’s father always said, “The only way to really understand what money means is to have been poor.” Danny’s explanation was that “traditionally the first generation makes the money, the second generation spends the money, and the third generation has to go to work again.” He said his father “completed the entire cycle in his own lifetime.” There is a lesson there. This also is a story about the relationship between parents and their children, and what roles each plays. It’s about forgiveness and acceptance. Families are complicated."

406,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/931455-dorothy,Rating 5 out of 5,"The main character in The Dutch House is the house itself. It looms over the lives of the human characters and haunts them to the very end of their days.The house was built in a suburb of Philadelphia by a Dutch couple, the VanHoebeeks, who had made a fortune in a cigarette distribution business that they started before World War I. The facade of the house was glass; you could look right through it. The lives of the people who lived in it were never so transparent.The VanHoebeeks raised their family there, but it was a family stalked by tragedy and by post World War II years, the only family member left was the mother who was cared for by a servant, Fiona (later nicknamed Fluffy). When the mother died, the house reverted to ownership by a bank and it was sold.The buyer was Cyril Conroy, a man who had grown up poor but through a combination of acumen and luck had parlayed a single investment in a property into an enormous real estate empire. He was a man with a wife whom he adored and a young daughter, Maeve. He wanted to give his wife an amazing gift and the Dutch House just fit the bill.When he took his wife and daughter to see the house and he told the wife he had bought it for her, she was astounded and appalled. She hated it! It was ostentatious, clearly the finest house in the town where it was located, but Elna was a woman who also had grown up in poverty and had flirted with the idea of becoming a nun and following Sister Theresa. She believed in the value of living simply and of serving the poor and needy of the world. She could never be happy in this house.Nevertheless, the family moved in. A son, Danny, was born. But over the years, Elna would be absent from the home for extended periods, leaving the children in the care of their father and the caretaker ""Fluffy,"" as well as two house servants who treated them as their own children. Finally, when Danny was three and Maeve was ten, she left for good. Her note said she was going to India.And so we have the two motherless children and the makings of a fairy tale. Shortly, Maeve develops Type 1 diabetes, which will be another burden she and her brother will bear throughout her life. She is devoted to the care and protection of her little brother, even in adulthood. She essentially sacrifices her life to ensure that he has everything he needs.In time, Cyril marries again to a much younger woman, the odious Andrea. Now we have the evil stepmother on the scene. We learn that Cyril's main attraction for her is in the house that he owns. She desired that house.Maeve moves out of the Dutch House as soon as she can. Danny is left alone with Andrea and her two daughters and his father. But not for long. His father dies at age fifty-three and Andrea is in control. She kicks him out of the house.Andrea is left in control of the business and the house. The only thing provided for Maeve and Danny is an educational trust, so Maeve devotes herself to seeing that her brother receives the most expensive education available.I could go on and on and recite the whole plot for you, but I have to leave something for you to discover!Patchett's prose is so straightforward and one could almost say old-fashioned. It is a very traditional way of telling a story, without tricks or embellishments, and I very much appreciated that after some of the other books I've read recently. (I'm looking at you, Marlon James!) I loved just about everything about her book, except I was a little disappointed with the ending. It seemed to just sort of fade out and I guess I was hoping for something a little more dramatic. I should have known better - no tricks, no embellishments, only real life."

This is a beautiful character driven novels about a family, a house, and how throughout their lives it continues to tear them apart and bring them back together. The main characters are written in such depth that by the end of the book I feel like I really knew them and mourned having to leave them behind on the final page. The house also felt like a whole character. The author describes it so vividly that you feel like you've walked its halls.I really enjoyed this. If you are looking for a book about love, loss, family both found and by blood, with lots of nods to the way of life of the past. This book is for you."
409,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27024624-suelucie,Rating 5 out of 5,"For me, the overwhelming themes of this novel are self-determination (for Danny and Maeve, and especially where Elna is concerned though I hesitate to elaborate for fear of spoiling the story for others) and the bond between siblings that both sustains and threatens to harm them both. Deprived at a young age of the privilege and luxury they were born into, Danny and his sister Maeve are forced to fend for themselves, eventually moving to New York but retaining strong ties to Philadelphia and the looming presence of their childhood home, the Dutch House. Maeve in particular who, a decade older than Danny, can remember their earlier lives, their father and their absent mother more clearly, obsesses for decades over the past and the calamity that exiled them. She decides her role in life is to care for Danny, pushing him in the direction she thinks best for him and putting aside ambition for herself. Their relationship is central to them both. Danny goes along with her plans but yearns for a different life. We follow their paths over many years to a superbly poignant conclusion. I am a huge fan of Ann Patchett’s writing. All the books I’ve read from her extensive back catalogue have been very different, though this one bears most resemblance to ‘Commonwealth’. Characters are key, especially here. Maeve is a terrific creation - brave, funny and utterly determined, if blinkered for most of the novel. Danny’s growing up is a journey I enjoyed very much. A couple of examples:‘That night in my sister’s bed I stared at the ceiling and felt the true loss of our father. Not his money or his house, but the man I sat next to in the car. He had protected me from the world so completely that I had no idea what the world was capable of. I had never thought about him as a child. I had never asked him about the war. I had only seen him as my father, and as my father I had judged him.’‘There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you’d been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet in place, and for a moment you’re suspended, knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself.’A great story that just flowed from the page, so beautifully written, and much food for thought here. I’ve no hesitation recommending it.With thanks to Bloomsbury via NetGalley for the opportunity to read an ARC."

A capa é fantástica, sem dúvida nenhuma. Mas não foi o que esperava, confesso, apesar de ser uma boa história familiar, ainda que só no início.É um livro que começa de forma forte e que nos agarra, mas lá para o meio, comecei a perder o entusiasmo… Tudo se passa em torno da casa que o pai dos protagonistas compra a uma família holandesa falida. Gostei da forma como a casa acaba por ocupar um papel tão central na narrativa. Os irmãos Maeve e Danny crescem nesta casa com o pai e as empregadas… a mãe, uma mulher simples mas sufocada pela nova vida e pela casa que quase a envergonha, abandonou a família. Os irmãos vão crescendo unidos, até o pai casar de novo. A madrasta, que se percebe que tinha um fascínio pela casa e não pelo marido, acaba por expulsar os irmãos quando o pai morre. E é nesta nova fase que os irmãos estreitam ainda mais os laços que os unem, acabando sempre por voltar à casa, ainda que só a vejam do lado oposto da rua. Ao longo da narrativa, vamos acompanhando a vida dos irmãos ao logo de décadas, e gostei particularmente da relação cúmplice entre eles – eu, que não tenho irmãos, fico sempre apanhada por estas relações tão fortes, cheias de memórias.Gostei da escrita da autora e fiquei com curiosidade de ler outros livros. Destaco a forma como a casa assume tanta importância: simboliza o declínio da família holandesa e a oportunidade de “crescer socialmente” da nova família. Ao mesmo tempo, foi a mudança para esta casa que fez desmoronar a família de Maeve e Danny, já que a mãe não suportava a nova vida. A casa assume o papel de porto de abrigo mas também de discórdia, sendo foco de guerras e famílias desfeitas.Além disto, o que me ficou deste livro? A partir do ponto de viragem que foi a morte do pai e a expulsão dos irmãos, a narrativa desenrola-se de forma pouco consistente, a meu ver. A vida dos dois irmãos torna-se pouco interessante, cheia de acontecimentos que não acrescentam muito, até ao fim, em que há lugar para reencontros e perdão e que, de certa forma, quase nos faz sentir os dois irmãos “vingados”. Mas o fim pareceu-me completamente inverosímil, confesso…"
411,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1415863-debbie,Rating 4 out of 5,"Re-Read July 2023 for Lit Wits Book ClubThis time I read the book instead of listening to it, but could still hear Tom Hanks’s voice as Danny as I read. I was struck again by how much history repeats itself as Danny made the same mistakes with his wife that his father did with his mother. I felt sorry for Danny’s wife because it would be hard to be married to a man who shared all his dreams and plans with his sister instead of his wife. I really enjoyed this re-read and all the details of the beautiful Dutch House. I also think the cover, which I’m sure is supposed to be the painting of Maeve, is beautiful.As I listened to The Dutch House, I couldn’t help but think of Ann Patchett’s previous novel, Commonwealth. Both books feature blended families. But Commonwealth needed a directory of all the different family members and The Dutch House focuses on Danny and his sister Maeve. It would be more correct to say that The Dutch House is a story of an “unblended” family. Danny and his sister decide early on that their father has married the wrong woman when he marries Andrea and brings her 2 young daughters to live at the Dutch house. Every character in the book has strong feelings about the Dutch house – Danny’s mother hated the home and left the family to work with the poor in India; Danny’s father felt it was s symbol of his success; Andrea loves the Dutch House – much more than she loves Danny’s father or his children; Danny and Maeve both love the home and are drawn to parking outside it and talking over old times after Andrea kicks them out of the house.I had hoped there would be some additional information about the Dutch House at the end of book. I can’t help but believe that Ann Patchett based this upon a real home. I would love more details!I admired Maeve for devoting her life to taking care of Danny and making sure he got through college and had a great life. Danny reminded me a lot of his father and I was reminded over and over that history repeats itself. Tom Hanks is the narrator for the audio book and does an outstanding job in telling Danny’s story."

Maeve and Danny who depended on this house with every thread of their being find themselves out of the house after Andrea, their stepmother decides that they are no longer her responsibility. With the recent demise of their father and a mother who ran away to India so she could 'help people' and also because she wanted to put some distance between herself and the house that suffocated her, these kids are left to fend for themselves.-The Dutch House, with all its inherent glory, meant different things for the people in this family. While it was 'home' for young Danny and Maeve, it was more of a status symbol for Cyril, a real estate developer. As Andrea came along, she prioritized financial security for herself and her family grabbing the first thing she could lay her hands on- the house.-As the mystery around the house continues, we get to see the mosiac relationship between siblings. Maeve has always been the responsible, mature and understanding one. She raises Danny like her own child and even sends him to medical school, in order to give him a better life (and to spite her stepmother). As the years pass by, Danny reciprocates this love but in a more fierce manner.-Patchett writes about this family (including the help) passionately. Danny's stubbornness, his way of handling relationships came from a place of suffering and misfortunes, whereas Maeve, always the accommodating one stays put like a rock even in pain and illness. @vivekisms describes this book as 'deceptively simple' and I could not agree more. The story peels off in layers, each layer more intricate than the other. While the pace might bother you a little, I would advise you to stay determined. Because it will be extremely rewarding."
413,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10110896-robert-blumenthal,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is a really quiet novel, akin to the novels of Alice McDermott and Colm Toibin. It is very much a character study, with some but limited narrative drive. If the reader does not become absorbed by these lucid characters (hard to fathom), I don't see him or her liking this book very much. There is a story here, one, obviously, involving a house and children growing up in it. But it is a very quiet, subtle story. One thing that the author definitely avoids is any melodrama at all, which is a good thing.Maeve and her younger brother Danny, the book's narrator, grow up with their father and stepmother in an old regal house in a suburb outside of Philadelphia, PA. Imagine my surprise upon learning that it is in Elkins Park, which is in the same school district in which I grew up. Maeva and Danny's mother leaves for good when Maeve is about 8 and Danny is an infant. The father eventually remarries to a woman who is rather cold and unfeeling to the children. After the father dies, she essentially kicks the children out of the house (Maeve is an adult, Danny is 15). They live their lives, Danny marrying and moving to New York, Maeve staying single and living in the same area. They are both still bound to the Dutch House of their youth, regularly driving to it and talking in the car. It becomes a ritual for them.As I said there isn't a lot of drama in this story. The reader is following the lives of these two who are as close as two siblings could be. I appreciated the subtlety and lack of melodrama in the telling and found myself absorbed in their lives. I also appreciated how the author made ""characters"" out of inanimate objects. The house, of course, for one. Also, much is mentioned about Maeve's hair. And there are portraits in the house that take on a life of their own. Patchett has really honed her craft and has settled into a very assured and unassuming place as a writer. The words seem to flow from her easily and with much grace."

I was captivated by the story and the writing. I lent the book to friends and relatives who also loved it. Because of that novel, I knew this one would be equally captivating.I was wrong. I fell asleep almost every time I sat down to read this book. Then I started skimming just to see if anything -- anything at all would happen. But no, just more of Danny sitting with his sister, Mauve, in a car in front of their childhood home (the Dutch house) reminiscing about all the ugly things that happened to them in the house. For some reason, never explained, Mauve does not like Danny's wife which causes a rift between them for several years but finally they get together again to once again sit in front of the house over and over for who knows why to review over and over their terrible childhood in the house ad nauseum.We are supposed to believe their mother abandoned her family when the kids were small because she hated this house. She goes to India to help the poor instead. Then she returns to the states to live on skid row for years. Years later she is 'found' by a former nanny and returns to her 'family' who embrace her unreservedly; in fact consider her a saint. Really? A saint? The step mother (who still lives in the house) has treated the children horribly, kicked them out of the house when they were still children, tricked them out of all the father's money, but in the end all is forgiven and everyone gets together and 'loves' one another because of the saintly mother's return! Happy endings are sprinkled throughout.This novel fell totally flat for me....."

It's just pipped her last novel, Commonwealth, another family saga, to top place as my favourite of her novels that I've read thus far.This is the story of a house. Before I started reading I found it hard to imagine how one house could be so instrumental in impacting the lives of the members of one family, but this is exactly what this novel goes on to explain. We follow the narrator, Danny, and his sister Maeve, as they grow up in the Dutch House in Philadelphia. What happens in this house as they grow up shapes the rest of their lives, and I found the resulting story totally captivating. This novel is, for me, Patchett at her best - just when you think the narrative might be losing its way something happens to suck you right back in to the story. One thing I love about books is when they make me view my own life and relationships in a different light, and that's something The Dutch House definitely achieved - namely about sibling relationships and the nature of family. While they're by no means identical novels I'd venture that if you enjoyed Commonwealth you'll find something to enjoy in this novel, too.Thank you Netgalley and Bloomsbury Publishing Plc (UK & ANZ) for the advance copy, which was provided in exchange for an honest review."

But what would I expect from Ann Patchett, she is one of my favorite authors. The character development was perfect as the story so intimately unfolded through the words of our narrator, Danny. The relationship, love and bond between he and his sister, Maeve (a new favorite character of mine by the way) knows no bounds. I can't recall being so affected by a relationship in a very long time. There's so many layers, emotion and depth to this story that I would not even know how to begin to give a synopsis. But if you are a fan of Ann Patchett, I do not think you will be disappointed. You may have many questions and thoughts to unravel after reading this book. I certainly did, and I grappled with how things turned out. My mind changed about a couple of the characters as the story drew to a close. And one of my Novel Ideas friends suggested how easily this could turn into a sequel - one can hope!

No entanto, achei a construção da narrativa um pouco confusa, as idas e vindas no tempo. Num parágrafo, Danny estava a falar da sua adolescência, no parágrafo a seguir já tinha 40 anos e a sua vida era outra. Levou-me algum a adaptar-me a estas mudanças.Sinto que as personagens evoluíram muito pouco, tendo em conta que a história é passada em mais de 50 anos. O Danny de 11 anos era o mesmo do Danny de 49. Basicamente, um banana. E achei bastante estranho que as personagens falassem da mesma forma, tivessem o mesmo discurso tanto aos 15 como aos 55.É verdade que é um livro para sentir e pensar nas coisas, na família, no passado e no peso que ambos têm em nós, na nossa personalidade, na nossa forma de reagir ao que nos acontece. No futuro.Contudo, não consegui sentir uma ligação às personagens, não consegui conectar-me à história. Admito que estava à espera de amar este livro, o que não aconteceu. Não desgostei, nem amei, apenas me passou ao lado. E é uma pena porque eu adoro tanto esta capa, penso que é das capas mais bonitas que eu tenho e talvez queira um quadro destes Como escrevi, gostei muito da escrita e vou querer ler mais da Ann Patchett. Talvez leia o 'Bel Canto', um dos livros mais conhecidos da autora."
418,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7022024-mike,Rating 4 out of 5,"I am not entirely sure why I enjoyed this book. There were no dragons or space ships in it, nor was it a history or energy book. It was simply a story of a pair of siblings and how they navigated their lives, with its ups and downs and not a little bit of bitterness for their step mother who kicked them out of their home upon the death of their father. The story told their lives both before and after this event and explored their familial and social relationships this event impacted. The non-linear unfolding of the story worked well with various points of tension of self-revelations for the characters, informing the reader how past events influenced their perception in the future. While not a pleasant read at all times (since any narrative worth its salt that covers decades of life is bound to have its low points) I found myself invested in the lives of the characters as well as curious to see how the story would resolve itself. An enjoyable reading experience overall that inly works if you like the main charatcers (which I did). If they don't end up clicking for you this book becomes insufferable."

I think I will need a few days to gather some coherent thoughts about this book, but suffice it to say that I thoroughly enjoyed every second of it! Tom Hanks actually managed to improve upon a text that was near-perfect to begin with; if I could I would give the audiobook a thousand stars, but alas, the boundaries of the flesh...By the way, I figured out that this is the perfect representation of the kinds of books that I tend to love - slow-paced, a doorstopper (well, this one isn't, but David Copperfield and War and Peace definitely are), not much plot to it but a story spanning several decades and generations, lots of introspection and reflection upon the bigger revolutions of human life; in short, a Bildungsroman."

A story about a house but also, I thought, a story about a sister who did everything for her brother and her family. When I started this book I was wondering ""why do people like this book so much"" but the more I read, the more I liked the characters and this is something this author does with all her books IMO, she really gets you to care about the characters because she lets you know them so well. By the second half of the book and also by 3rd section, I was in love with all the characters and also by the end I loved the fact that the house had gone full circle with the family.

I have to admit I struggled to get into this book , though I wonder if it less the book than my current reading doldrums. Over all I enjoyed this multigenerational tale of a family home, called The Dutch House.Ann Patchett is a genius at painting a literary portrait that come alive in the reader's mind. I could see the house clearly and all the drama that unfolded there. The middle lagged a little. I found I enjoyed the siblings more as they navigated their adult relationships.

441,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5015851-ms-pegasus,Rating 5 out of 5,"Descriptions of the Dutch House suggest the spirit of the Dutch “Golden Age” with its celebration of worldly success. It was actually built in the 1920's by Mr. VanHoebeek who made his money in the cigarette business. To the characters of this book, the Dutch House is the stage for ever-changing memories and interpretations of the past. Patchett pursues this theme of unreliable memory with poignant vignettes. A pre-pubescent Danny imagines star-crossed lovers as he gazes at the portrait of a young girl. (The house came with its fastidious vintage décor, complete with VanHoebeek family portraits, clothes, and personal artifacts). Danny calls her Julia. Who was she, he fantacizes. His sister Maeve, older by seven years, bursts his fantasy. The portrait is the girlhood version of old Mrs. VanHoebeek. The visible reminder of aging jolts him.  “They were paintings of the same women seated at either end of her life, old Mrs. VanHoebeek and young Julia caught in a breeze. And really, even if it wasn't the same woman, such a likeness made it clear how one day the daughter would become the mother .""(Location 728). There is no worry, however, that his sister Maeve will become her own mother. Their own mother was young, immature and naive. She hated the house, the surprise “gift” from her husband Cyril. She felt lost and shamed by its opulence. She left when Danny was four. Maeve becomes Danny's fierce protector for the rest of her life. Danny, with no memory of his mother, hardly misses her. Maeve has different memories, and finds the familial security and affectionate acceptance she longs for in her job working for Mr. Otterson. Despite graduating first in her class at Barnard with a mathematics degree, she is content to work as his bookkeeper. It's a reaction as much to their mother's absence as their father Cyril's emotional absence. Cyril has one passion, his work as a developer. He loves houses, He loves building and renovating houses. We watch how Danny's indifference toward his mother coalesces into anger. However, it is Maeve who rightly points out Cyril's shortcomings:  “Out father was a man who had never met his own wife.” (Location 2446)When Cyril remarries, his shortcomings will fall on his new wife, Andrea. In one sense, they are a good fit. Cyril is self-absorbed with his work; Andrea is self-absorbed with the house. In every other way, the marriage is a mistake, and Patchett has some fun by having Danny describe how Cyril had to work with the scant material of Sunday mass (Andrea is not Catholic) in order to escape from even more unwanted family time. Patchett's technique is subtle. Since we see Andrea through Danny and Maeve's eyes, she deflects much of the blame for Cyril's faults. It's a pattern that is unconsciously repeated: when Danny marries Celeste he notes that his own faults are often blamed on Maeve. Both Danny and Maeve are stuck in the past, but the narrative is presented in a unique way. There is almost no present-day timeline. Instead, Danny and Maeve recall a remote past through the lens of their past selves. These double-mirrored reflections skip around in time. Recollections about Fluffy (Fiona) their nursemaid who actually grew up in the house, the premature death of Cyril at age 53, and Andrea's usurpation of all of their lives occur as Danny looks back on his youth, his years in med school, and his adulthood as a developer like his father. Danny and Maeve are rooted in an obsession with the past, one that is further represented by their eerie compulsion to periodically stalk the house from curbside, speculating about the lives of Andrea and her two young daughters. Characters absent from their lives exert a powerful hold on their emotions. Danny asks Maeve at one point:  “Do you think its possible to ever see the past as it acually was?....we overlay the present onto thee past. We look through the lens of what we know now, so we're not seeing it as people we were, we're seeing it as the peeople we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.” (Location 584 ).This is a beautiful book – beautiful in its structure, beautiful in the vulnerable characters it brings to life. It was the selection of our local book club."

I'm sure this is subjective, but there is just something about her writing that is just so soothing and effortless to me. This is also going to be subjective, but it also amazed me how well she wrote a man. Perhaps some of all genders think this way, but some of the lines she threw out oh-so casually seemed so very masculine:Then I remembered what my father had told me, that the things we could do nothing about were best put out of our minds. I gave it a try and found that it was easier than I imagined.AndWhat I wanted was what I had: three nights a week. And to be perfectly honest, I would have been happier with two.Last example of writing that I loved was the unintentionally hilarious sort:""I couldn't tell your sister. I couldn't make her diabetes worse.""""Knowing where your mother is doesn't make diabetes worse,"" I said, trying to apply logic to a conversation where no logic existed.The pleasure of reading it, plus the unexpected pleasure of hearing all my SEPTA stops (I live in the Philly suburbs and work in Philly), made this an absolute treat and a delight to read!The characters were rich and nuanced for sure! She might not spend a lot of time on detailed characteristics, but she makes sure to give you certain very identifiable traits that, at least for Danny, the narrator, define that particular character. The whole thing just felt like a conversation with an old friend.The crazy turns of Danny's life were also a trip to read. He was a very interesting character with an interesting life that I was definitely drawn into. And the way Patchett wrote it, skipping around in the timeline, should have been jarring but it wasn't; again, it was like talking to an old friend where they're telling you a story about when they were 30 but have to add in a detail about when they were 13 in order to inform a part of their story from when they were 30. The whole book flowed like this.I understood and appreciated the bond between siblings, it was incredibly strong throughout, like, outrageously strong. And while neither spent a lot of time talking about how much they loved the other or all the things they were so grateful to the other for doing, you could just feel it emanating up out of the words. That was powerful and moving.However, the book description sets you up for rage and not being able to let go of the past and confrontation and relationships being tested and it was never, ever that dramatic. It did have all those things, but it was never dramatic... Why would you try to make it more dramatic than it is?As I mentioned first off, there was no plot, as such. I feel guilty taking a star off for a book that was beautifully written because it wasn't 'action-packed' enough, but honestly, that's not it. I didn't need action - the coming-of-age and everyday life of these people was awesome to be a part of. It was just hard for me to grasp the point, and as a result, I don't ever see myself reading this again. I highly recommend the book, but I don't feel the need to own it, and revisit it again and again."

Their father remarries, but after he dies, their stepmother kicks Danny and Maeve out of her life and out of the house. Suddenly, all Danny and Maeve have is each other. This story explores their complicated lives and relationships.If you love Ann Patchett and her heavily character-driven stories and beautifully written literary fiction, you will likely love The Dutch House. If you’re looking for a page-turning plot, you might like to look elsewhere. If you love complicated family drama with a great deal of reflection, stick around! Danny and Maeve analyze every aspect of their childhood experiences including the domestic help, their father, the stepmother and her children, and, of course, the Dutch House.Danny is the matter-of-fact narrator and Maeve is the overprotective and, at times, controlling older sister. We feel a great deal of compassion for these siblings as we learn more about their abandonment in various ways by mom, dad, and stepmother.Thoughtful themes in The Dutch House include an incredibly close sibling relationship, the effects of abandonment on children, wealth and privilege, materialism, family loyalty, expectations, revenge, greed, compassion, childhood, and memories. If my book club reads this, one topic I’d like to discuss is the house as a symbol or metaphor for childhood. The most fascinating part of the story for me is when Danny and Maeve return to the house (parking out front) over and over again throughout their lives to reminisce about their childhood and to work through their various viewpoints and feelings. It seems to me that this is the real heart of the story.I listened to the audio of The Dutch House because I couldn’t resist Tom Hanks as the reader! He is magnificent as Danny! Honestly, this story might have been a DNF for me except for the performance of Tom Hanks. I highly recommend the audio version!Content Warning: Medical issues related to diabetesRecommended: I recommend The Dutch House for fans of Ann Patchett, for those who appreciate literary fiction, and for readers who love character-driven stories and beautiful writing.For more reviews visit my blog www.readingladies.com"
444,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9281934-louise,Rating 4 out of 5,"At times I was riveted, and sometimes not. Some of the sections are longer than their value to the story. The characters were well drawn so I read it quickly, mainly to see how it would end.Patchett creates a 1950's life of an upwardly mobile family. You have a ""dad"" who openly favors the son over the daughter, but neither child knows him at all. This dad is becoming wealthy in real estate but still collects his own rents in units where some tenants are struggling to pay. He is no bleeding heart, but is not oblivious to the needs of these tenants.This 1950's family lives in a neighborhood, not an estate or isolated place as is the norm today. Despite the valuable antiques and the swimming pool (today a liability if not secured) there are no gates or alarms. The family has a nanny, cook and housekeeper that relate to them and care for them (and vice versa, with the exception of the dad) as people, not just ""staff"".You also see something not often acknowledged about the 1950's: the way Protestants looked at Catholics. Also, like the 1950's there is no mention of race. The mother of this family is the only weakly drawn character. Her post-war marriage is about the only thing that seems realistic about her and her life.For the 1960's there are some references to anti-war protests, but this family does not seem to have a point of view on this. (While it is not mentioned, most likely a student deferment shelters its son.) After the clarity on the 1950's, particularly on the role of women, I was expecting more as the story moves into the 70's and 80's. Maybe there should have been some helicoptering, boomeranging or even generation gapping or just terms like dad's: ""knucklehead"". While it isn't the best pacing for a work of literature, I'm glad the ending was rushed, since I stayed with it primarily to see where it would go. If not realistic, the ending is satisfying and worth the read."
445,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5887880-lorilin,Rating 5 out of 5,"Danny and Maeve have an interesting relationship with their childhood home. Named the Dutch House, their father bought the impressive but imposing house as a surprise when Danny and Maeve were young. Though the children love the house and come to think of it as their magical castle, their mother can’t stand the new home and eventually moves out, never to be heard from again. Their father soon remarries a cold woman named Andrea who loves the house…but never much cares for Danny and Maeve. When their father dies just a few years later, Andrea kicks both children out, leaving them destitute (save for a trust for future educational expenses). Danny and Maeve make their own way in the world—and do surprisingly well for themselves—but they still routinely drive back to the old neighborhood to sit in front of their former home and talk. It’s a way to support each other, but also a way to revisit and process the pain of their childhood.MY THOUGHTSThe Dutch House is all about the internal lives of characters. Told from Danny’s perspective, the reader doesn’t always get an accurate understanding of what really happened. But that is one of the main issues explored in the book, this question of what is real, what really happened, and if we can ever know the “facts” of our past when there is so much emotion layered within our memories. There are so many interesting relationships explored here—between siblings, between children and their parents, between a family and their home. It’s not a book that gives answers, but it does ask the reader to think and to question, and, more importantly, to look into the past, accept people’s limitations, and ultimately to be willing to forgive. The Dutch House is a captivating, thoughtful read, and I think it’s going to stay with me for a good long while."

Period. I don’t know if I would have liked this or finished it otherwise. It is perfection.Hanks puts 110% effort into everything he does. He embodies Danny, all the emotions, perfectly captures his POV, but yet also does an excellent job of narrating Maeve’s and the others’ POV’s as well. Pretty much he needs to make this a second career, but I digress.The book centers on the Dutch House and its main occupants, the Conroy family. Danny and Maeve are about as close as a brother and sister can get, and it was a joy to watch their relationship ebb and flow over their lifetime. Their father raised them after their mother left, and then one fateful day Andrea officially became their stepmother and she and her two children moved into the house. This created an additional strain, and she eventually exiles them from the house when their father passes away suddenly. At its core, this is a story about a family and relationships. The family led interesting lives at times, at other times not so much. What captivated me throughout was to see how both Danny and Maeve matured, and how they each relied so much on each other, because they were all each other had throughout the majority of their life. People came and went and threatened this reliance, but it was always there. I grew to love both Danny and Maeve, and in the end, was not ready for my time with them to end.I do recommend this one, as I still think about it after having finished it over a week ago. However, I highly suggest that you experience this via audiobook, I believe it is a game changer."
447,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2635637-jenniferd,Rating 5 out of 5,"this review is for the audiobook edition, narrated by tom hanks.my goodness, this is so damn great! like, seriously excellent. patchett's story and writing are pitch-perfect, and her characters are vivid. the relationship between siblings maeve and danny is the most endearing and lovely brother-sister bond i can ever recall reading - it's layered and nuanced.hanks' embodiment of danny is outstanding. his tones, expression of emotions and moods, and comedic timing are fantastic. (i mean, this isn't a comedic novel, but patchett can be quite a funny writer at moments, through dialogue or observation. hanks certainly made the most of these moments.) i guess for clarity: i am not a die-hard tom hanks fan. of course i enjoy him, and believe him to be a kind and thoughtful guy (god - hope that continues to be true). but i was not predisposed to automatically loving this story because he is the narrator. i guess that's all i'm trying to say. 😊)given our current global pandemic, and coupled with my currently dismal reading abilities, this novel has proven to be the perfect balm during a tough time. so perfect, in fact, that i finished it, then immediately started it again. then again. i am just about finished my 3rd round with the dutch house and i enjoyed each reading/listen as much as the first - perhaps even a bit more each time. it's rare for me to do any re-reading, let alone more than twice.i can't imagine loving any read more in 2020 than this one... for me, it was the perfect book at the perfect time, and a lovely, lovely experience that was very much needed."
448,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38644153-pranjal-joshi,Rating 5 out of 5,"A Banquet of Halcyon DaysPatchett romances Past in her latest work- a trope so ruminatingly written and so delicately marinated in the most exquisite word play of language. The narrative feels like the peeling of one’s own sense of loss and bereavement layer by layer; we all have stories/truncated missing pieces of the past that we find ways to recycle-repatch and share them time and again for it to be embedded in our collective memory of the bygone times like an embroidered motif on an inherited handkerchief that one feels the compulsive need to keep on touching to assure its fading presence –‘taking apart the past with a flea comb.’‘Do houses ever die of grief?’The Dutch House- the pivot of its central characters’ collective emotional past-present life is a work of art in the neo-classical/Mediterranean/French architecture, a magnificent mansion of Maeve and Danny’s childhood and an emblem of their banishment with the advent of their stepmother. It is said that writers have the craft of spinning the same story every time with different weaves and patterns hitherto, Patchett revamps the myth of the evil stepmother throwing the brother-sister duo out in the woods, with a touching story of the shatterproof sibling connection spanning decades- ‘We had made a fetish out of our misfortune….’This book can be judged by its piercing and striking cover….The character of Maeve is so impeccably written and finely detailed that made me stare its cover every time Danny revives the memory of his sister when she was a 10 year old-red-coat wearing Maeve, with a world full of possibilities laid out in front of her…A very fulfilling reading experience!

So much so that I struggle to come up with the right words to describe it, so I'll let this New York Times review do the job for me:""Patchett’s prose is confident, unfussy and unadorned. I can’t pluck out one sentence worth quoting, but how effective they are when woven together—these translucent lines that envelop you like a spider’s web.” There wasn't much I didn't love about her latest novel: the incredible bond between Danny (our narrator) and his sister, Maeve (whom I adored); the remarkable gem of a (Dutch) House they spent their childhoods in until the moment they didn't—a house that became a character unto itself; the smart way Ann hopped narratives between the present and the past in a way that almost, but never quite, lost me; and the way this book felt at once like a modern-day classic.It wasn't the fastest of reads for me, but that was okay ...it just meant that every time I picked it up, I savored anew the setting, the language, and being back with a cast of characters I came to love all the more.A great novel to kick off my fall reads, for sure. Also: I loved reading Debbie's review  after I finished—I agree with so much of it!"

I am enjoying it. There is a huge waiting list!*********************Return to Reading! February 12, 2020The focus of this novel is, as implied, a house. It is a lovely, unique, stately, yet enchanting glass structure. The setting was as fitting ,in the countryside, with few neighboring homes. Of course a home must have its inhabitants, so the reader meets the Conroys and all their associates. This is mainly about Danny and his sister, Maeve, who grew up there and had continued to persist, both in reminiscence and in actual visits to this home well into adulthood. This is something of a fairy-tale, complete with a cruel step-mother. Patchett has introduced many interesting, even likeable, characters. The narrative is told in a thoughtful, careful manner, complete with devoted relationships to friends and family, anger and forgiveness. I have continued to feel that Patchett's, Bel Canto was her best offering. As I read this book I frequently sensed that it would shamble (to coin a GR friend's term!) along pleasantly without offering much stimulation or surprise."

Due to the plethora of amazing reviews I forced myself to the end, to make sure I'd given it my all - but it felt like a chore. I listened to the audiobook and however much I love Tom Hanks (tbh he's why I got it), I can't say he helped the story for me.I normally think ""the book is always best"" but this one reminds me of my experience of reading the Handmaids Tale and being very underwhelmed but blown away by the series. I can imagine The Dutch House making a decent movie or miniseries where the characters could be given some depth, the story brought to life and the padding in the book just becoming incidental, in the background stuff. What am I missing? I am such an eclectic reader and normally enjoy meaty, character driven novels - this just didn't feel ""meaty"" to me, characters felt two dimensional, the story just went on and on and then eventually ended. I breathed a sigh of relief. I'm still interested in other books by Ann Patchett as others, who have rated this book in a similar way to me, have commented on books by Patchett that they have really enjoyed.Time to move on, can't please everyone!"

The cover is gorgeous and it's based on a portrait done of the daughter of ""the Dutch house"". I kept seeing this as a movie. It's a colorful book. Not only the spectacular house, but there would be scenes of India, medical school, home repairs, ballet and New York City which brings a million viewers. My own issue was, I kept expecting some big reveal or plot twist. All the loose ends are tied up, but there's not that many. I was thinking perhaps Maeve was the vegetable factory's longtime mistress. How did the stepmother get so evil? I expected Norma and Bright to do *something* or Sandy, Jocelyn or Fluffy would do something nebulous that bring about a happier result. Who was Elna married to, that she was still wearing a wedding ring? Or as a Catholic did she not believe in divorce? Or was she a sister and took her vows?Not that I know that much law, but I was thinking perhaps Andrea would only have use of the house for her lifetime. That was a weak part of the plot. The father was so keen on business, but not to have a will? Or a prenup for that matter."

Maeve was single and then watching Danny's family grow up. They only had each other after their mother left when they were young and their father died eventually. I know it's not saying much about the book but I'm just overwhelmed at all that was going on and all that happened and how it all came together in the end.

It is steeped in character studies and imagery. It is a novel that readers will get absorbed in, or will not finding engaging. I listened to this on audiobook, and loved Tom Hanks' narration. He took the time to give the characters the unique voice Ann Patchett developed. While, as the title suggests, this novel is about a home, it is more about what makes a home. In this case we have two siblings trying to find answers to that question. The Dutch House is a slow simmer of a read, but well worth the time.***I received a complimentary copy of this ebook from the publisher through Edelweiss.

Nie je to výtka, je to konštatovanie. Práve tým si kniha získava široké publikum. Len kde-tu prebleskli jemné rebelantské vety (opustenie rodín mužmi, poznámka na možnosti uplatnenia sa žien). Samotný dom je spojivom, tak trochu tým pripomína Dom duchov, napokon aj postavy a vzťahy mi Dom duchov niečím pripomínajú. Asi najzásadnejšiu výhradu mám voči postavám. Hoci sa zdá, že sú veľmi komplexné, po dočítaní som si uvedomila, že boli vykreslené veľmi jednotvárne. Prakticky počas celého života sa správali stále rovnako, nedošlo k ani jedinému vybočeniu."

The dynamic between these characters is so absorbing, you will get sucked into this story and look up 80 pages later. I loved all of the dysfunction as well as all the connection between Danny and Maeve and their situation with Andrea. Every single character is fleshed out and believable. There are enough surprises to keep you breathless but the heart of the story beats throughout - the indelible love between Danny and Maeve.

Perhaps Tom Hanks would’ve sweetened the pot, but I’m not an audiobook listener and doubt that I ever will be. In every single character I could not find a single trait that I admired or enjoyed, and the most I got out of this novel were the sweeping descriptions of the house and environment. On the basis of those descriptions alone it earns an extra star- I could even smell the house as it was described to me. However, this beautiful panopticon look at an architectural marvel was somewhat sullied by the throes of family drama, and so, I was left feeling disappointed by what was put forward. "

There was at once fairy tale quality to it and psychological insight conveyed despite and through the narrator's own biases and misreadings. I found Maeve heart-breaking.

475,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4272284-kristina-coop-a-loop,Rating 2 out of 5,"I am no fan of Ann Patchett. The Dutch House is my first read by her and probably my last. When I attended a reading by David Sedaris last November, he couldn’t praise The Dutch House enough. David Sedaris usually tries to bring attention to lesser-known authors when he is touring, but he had recently finished this book and was still caught up in its magic. Well, the magic he felt it had. Being a David Sedaris enthusiast, I too became excited about this book and finally got around to buying and reading it. Meh. Strike two, David. He also recommended Ottessa Moshfegh’s Eileen and I hated that. The Conroys live in a fabulous house, a mansion really, outside of Philadelphia. Dad is a real estate developer who has achieved the American Dream—starting poor and ending up rich through lots of hard work and persistence. There are two children, Maeve and Danny, born several years apart. When Danny is very young, his mother leaves and Danny is essentially raised by his older sister Maeve and the family’s two loyal servants, the sisters Jocelyn and Sandy. To everyone’s dismay, the father eventually remarries. His new bride, Andrea, brings discord and unhappiness to the Dutch House. The modern equivalent of the mythical evil stepmother, she successfully distances Maeve and Danny from their father (and the Dutch House) and stops them from gaining their inheritance. With only themselves to rely on, the siblings form strong bonds to each other and the past—but will these attachments prevent them from making the most of their futures? The Dutch House is brilliantly constructed, weaving past and present events into one seamless narrative. For the most part, the pace of the story is good as well. I had a difficult time putting the book down even though it is not a thriller of any kind. This is a deceptively simple story of the relationships within a family; its resentments, loyalties, acts of cruelty and carelessness, love and selflessness. I didn’t like it. To be clear: there is nothing technically wrong with the book. The prose, while I don’t find it enthralling or sparkling, is competent. Even though there is one narrator, Danny, the author cleverly presents the perspectives and memories of several characters throughout the novel. I think this book would be an excellent pick for a book club. Even though I found myself generally irritated, I wasn’t necessarily bored and some great conversations could be had about the characters. What I like best about this book is the jacket illustration of the girl wearing the red coat. It’s beautiful. When I donate this book, I may keep the dust jacket. My distaste for this novel is definitely personal, so if you want to read it don’t be turned off by my review. I have many reasons for not liking this novel. Overall, I don’t care for Patchett’s style of storytelling. I felt as if she was telling me everything and left nothing for me to discover. When a character has a change of heart, I’m explicitly told this. Patchett doesn’t merely describe the actions of the character and let me decide for myself how that character feels, I’m told flat out: X has decided to forgive Y and move on. I often felt as if I were reading a family newsletter: now the Conroys did this and did this and this is how they felt when doing these things. Maeve and Danny did this because they felt this. There wasn’t a lot of mystery left because all the motivations of the characters were so thoroughly discussed by the characters themselves. Danny’s former nanny is named Fiona. No one calls her that. She is referred to as Fluffy. She is not a dog. She is not a cat. Don’t call her Fluffy. That irritated the shit out of me. Also, adults calling their parents “mommy” and “daddy” puts my teeth on edge. Maeve—even up the age of 50+—calls her mother “mommy” through the whole novel. I formed no connection with the characters. Maeve, Danny, the parents, Andrea the evil stepmother…. I was interested enough to want to know what happened and how the story would end, but I have no strong feelings for any of them. The problem is the stakes aren’t high enough. Sure,  Andrea disinherited them, but in the end, so what? Maeve carried all that anger and resentment and hatred for years, but when their father died she already had her degree, had a stable job and could support herself. Their father, despite his incredible level of carelessness about his children and inability to see Andrea for what she was, managed to establish an education trust that Danny used to get his schooling. That in turn helped him become a successful real estate developer. No one went hungry, no one was homeless. If Danny and Maeve had truly been left penniless and the anger and hatred for Andrea had stunted and ruined their lives, the sentimental and all-too-perfect ending would have resonated more with me. But they were fine. Conversely, what would have changed if they had inherited the Dutch House and all the money? Despite Maeve’s obvious intelligence, she wasn’t ambitious. She was happy with her life as it was. Danny, the person who should have been more resentful because his dream to join his father’s company and eventually take over was completely destroyed by Andrea (and the idiocy of his father), was the most unaffected emotionally. He didn’t hold onto the anger and resentment; however, as a loyal brother who loved his sister, he did what she wanted—which was to put her plan of revenge into play by depleting the trust as much as possible. He got a medical degree he didn’t want and still followed his dream of real estate development. The actions of a jealous and resentful stepmother didn’t affect their lives in any long-term way. History looms large in this novel. In order to piece together a coherent and complete account of past events in the Dutch House, nearly all of the characters from the Conway siblings’ past (including Maeve and Danny) take their turn to relate bits of history. The stories are woven into the narrative as conversations so it’s not awkward, but the constant cycling back to the past eventually becomes exhausting and irritating. Yes, we get it. Do we really need to hear from another character about Days Past In the Dutch House? I guess I just didn’t think it was all so tragic and awful as the characters did. Constant repetition stripped the events of their drama and again—everyone pretty much  turns out a-okay.Despite the book’s title and the constant mention of the Dutch House, I didn’t have a clear picture of it. Of course, the image of the house isn’t important. The house is a symbol of frustrated dreams, hopes and how we deceive ourselves. I also thought of the house as a stand-in for the patriarch, Cyril Conroy. His decision to buy it for his bride demonstrates how little he knew her—a pattern he continued throughout his life. He never really knew his family. He took what made him happy and transferred that to his wife and kids, not understanding (or taking the time to care about understanding) their happiness. Ironically, he eventually does recognize that Andrea married him to become mistress of the Dutch House (and have his money) but he still misjudges her character enough to leave her in charge of his children and his business. I find it odd that Maeve and Danny save all their anger for Andrea and none for their father. It was his responsibility to secure their futures and he didn’t care enough to do that. I see this tendency in Danny—the obliviousness—but I think sometimes this is Celeste’s fault. She was not a young, shy bride and had been vocal about her opinions on other matters so when she tells Danny (years later) that she hated their New York City house, he’s surprised and then feels bad. I call bullshit on that. If she didn’t like the apartment, why didn’t she say so? She certainly didn’t hold back on her dislike of Maeve, so why should a building be a more difficult subject? An interesting discussion could be had on who is the villain of the story. Or does the story have a villain? The father’s lack of attention to his family caused Andrea. Andrea was the quintessential (and considering the prominent place she holds in the novel, she’s surprisingly and disappointingly undeveloped) evil stepmother. Celeste forms a deep and lasting dislike of Maeve, but that’s mostly because she’s unhappy with Danny. Is Danny a bad guy for doing what he wants and not making Celeste happy with his career choice? (I don’t think so; she wanted the superficial social status of being a doctor’s wife so her disappointment and unhappiness is her own.) Did his close relationship with Maeve stop him from being fully committed to his family? What about the mother who abandons the family to go to India to help the poor?  Andrea isn’t the villain. She’s basically a plot device to set everything in motion. Mom is the villain. She causes the most long-lasting damage to the family unit. She abandons her family to be a do-gooder in India. When this doesn’t work out the way she wanted, she travels around the world basically becoming some kind of martyr for good works. When she eventually returns and Maeve forgives her, my sympathy is 100% for Danny’s unwillingness/inability to be as gracious. As the wife of a wealthy real estate developer, she could have stayed and helped the families in Philadelphia—as she was doing before she left. Maeve defends her mother’s abandonment by saying that men does this so why shouldn’t women? “Men leave their children all the time and the world forgives them for it…They set out on their noble journeys to do whatever the hell they wanted to do and thousands of years later we’re still singing about it. Our mother left and she came back and we’re fine” (297). My problem with Maeve’s argument is she is speaking of generalities—maybe those children abandoned by the fathers aren’t fine with it? We don’t know. Danny is speaking of his personal hurt, not a woman’s right to go on noble adventures just like men. And, really, they aren’t fine. The mother is described consistently throughout the novel by different characters as being a saint. I call bullshit on that too. The mother abandoned her children to the (eventual) tender mercies of Andrea because she felt that she, and ONLY she, could help save the world’s poor. That’s not being a good person or wanting to help the poor. That’s a very specific form of narcissism. Eventually, Do-Gooder Mom abandons adult Maeve for the sick and dying Andrea because Mom felt that Andrea needed her more and again, SHE was the only person who could help her. Do-Gooder Mom’s second abandonment of Maeve hurt Maeve deeply and may have caused her death. This extends the idea presented earlier in the book that Maeve’s juvenile diabetes is caused by the first abandonment. Do-Gooder Mom is despicable.The end of the novel is way too tidy for me. Patchett neatly bookends the story of the Dutch House and Do-Gooder Mom by having Mom, who fled the house when she was young because it was too fancy pants for her, return to the Dutch House to take care of Andrea—the woman who stole the house from her children. Then Danny’s now famous and successful actress daughter buys the house. Sigh. The author wraps this story up with a bow and every copy should have come with a box of Kleenex for the resulting sentimental tears. Blech. I didn’t like this book and wouldn’t read another Ann Patchett novel. Good discussions can be had over the story, but in the end, I’m left shrugging my shoulders. So what? I didn’t take anything from this novel and its exploration of family relationships didn’t present me with any new perspectives on the theme. The narrative was more about telling than showing and too neatly packaged for my tastes. "
476,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2845518-f,Rating 2 out of 5,"August 28:Hi, I have been thinking about ""The Dutch House"" and I have realized that the saint-like white woman who only wants to help people and is (boo-hoo!) punished by the world for it is far too egregious for me to ignore anymore. I am lowering my rating.I did not like it when it was a plot point in the book and, thinking back about it for the past week, I REALLY do not think there was any sort of purpose for it in the novel. I am talking about, of course, EVERYTHING about Elna. Ann Patchett's reasoning for Elna's behaviour is to have everyone repeat that ""[Elna] wanted to help people!"". That is LITERALLY all the detail and reasoning that is given for everything Elna does, and somehow I am meant to think that this is saintly behaviour which excuses abandoning your children. The maids, who are hired by Elna, repeat, over and over again, that ""Poor Elna could not live in the Dutch House. She had to leave because she wanted to help people!"". First of all, this book is written by someone who has never been around a nanny, or spoken to someone who is lower class. Please talk to anyone who is required to take care of neglected children because their mother wanted to go ""help the poor"" in other countries.I mention this in my earlier review, but I genuinely hate how vague it is all phrased: ""help[ing] the poor"". You have to forgive your mother because all she wanted was to ""help the poor"". What kind of patronizing bullshit is that? Everyone who has ever met Elna gives her the same excuse. Maeve and Danny's dad seems like the most reasonable person in the book.I can understand how this is written if I felt like the author, Ann Patchett, was also criticizing Elna's behaviour, but I did not get that from ""The Dutch House"". Everyone in the novel is more or less okay with the vaguest, most absurd ""Elna went away from 30+ years because she wanted to help people"" because... everyone in that book is stupid? I cannot say. I absolutely LOVE that Maeve forgives Elna, and has long conversations with her about their past, and Danny, our narrator, is never privy to those conversations. How convenient.I am leaving my original review up, but I have realized that I don't like how the book unfolded or ended anymore. I stand by what I said: it was engaging enough that I did not want to put it down. But that does not mean that it was good, and that does not mean that, once I had finished reading it, I did not feel absolute disappointment. I might also remove ""Bel Canto"" from my TBR list. We'll see.August 22:It’s hard to rate “The Dutch House”. I believe it’s a 3.5 rating but I’m marking it higher because I liked well enough that I needed to finish it as soon as I started reading it.Please be warned, there are major spoilers for “The Dutch House” in my review.You have a self-sacrificing, savior-complex of a mother Elna, who sets this whole thing in motion. You can blame the Dutch House or Cyril but, well, Elna is the one who leaves. You have two kids: Maeve and Danny who are so stunned and stunted by their mother’s departure that it defines their childhood. Their father’s remarriage defines their teenagehood. Being summarily kicked out of the Dutch House by Andrea defines their adulthood. They spend their lives either in the Dutch House or parked outside of it, reliving their times, trying to move on, but kind of failing, and then finally, actually moving on.There is a lot that feels disjointed and unedited in ""The Dutch House"". It moves back and forth in its narrative which I do not mind, and actually enjoy! But the story itself, the personalities and characteristics change a lot. For one, the novel's religious overtones came out of left field. I just don’t buy the reasoning Elna gives for being gone, nor the reasons she gives for coming back. Maeve mentions once that their mother likes going to church, and when she comes back it is her entire personality. It feels sudden and out-of-the-blue because religion is mentioned only in passing, and only barely. I can barely justify it by thinking that, well, Danny is not religious, his sister is, and this is Danny’s story so we do not see the importance of religion in their lives. If that’s the truth, then have the story from Maeve’s perspective.But we don’t. This is what I mean by the book being disjointed and unedited: so much is just up in the air and unexplained and I am supposed to go with the flow. Make the book longer and explore everything you want to explore.I can understand coming back to take care of Andrea. That is, frankly, the kind of batshit nice thing that my mother would do and which would drive me insane. But she did not even know that Andrea was sick? She just decided to come back and see her kids because, I don't know, she has been in the United States without them for too long. But to live in that house again, the house she abandoned her children in, and consider it a penance because now she’s taking care of Andrea? Where did that come from? Nothing in that book made sense.Back to Elna, this mythical figure who drives and causes so much of the novel's action: Elna travels to India, to Mexico City, to other countries wanting to go help the poor. That is literally how it is phrased, your mother has left to go “help the poor”. And Elna is upset and disillusioned when she travels to India and instead of toiling in hospitals, she is sent to the big embassy parties and gatherings to ask wealthy people who live there for money. The Indians/Mexicans who work in these charities and hospitals DO NOT want her in their hospitals fucking shit up for them. They do not need a LITERAL UNTRAINED HAND to work in the hospitals with them. They have nurses for that. They want someone who can booze and schmooze and get them the funds that they needed. And Elna was UPSET about that. She travels from one developing country to another hoping it'll be different. It is ""Eat, Pray, Love"" except the female character only visits countries in need, has abadoned two children at home, and is actually a woman who want to discover herself with the vague notion ""helping the poor""! Ridiculous.I just wish that part was emphasized even more. God, I would hate, and I do hate, knowing that someone with, once again, this savior complex is going to think “Gosh, Elna truly WAS a saint like Jocelyn, Sandy, and Fluffy kept saying! She’s amazing! I should do that!”. For the longest time, I thought Patchett would criticize Elna, not even just for the fact that she abadoned her children, but for the damaging notion she had about developing countries. She just books a yacht, and travels to India one day. Like, that is her grand plan. I thought that a book written in 2019 was building to this big idea about how dangerous these ""old"" white saviour ideas are. And yet, life disappoints once again.Reality check: if you travel to third world countries to ""help"" them, and leave your kids for, you will not get to live in a massive house as penance. Please read any article about the dangers of white peace corps volunteers cause in the countries they visit before you think what Elna did was so amazing. Look up volun-tourism. Really, what I think everyone should focus on is what Maeve and Danny kept saying: were there not poor people closer by? She could have worked in churches, orphanages, rehab centres in the United States. She could have gone to school and studied to be a nurse or volunteered all her time at the church. But no. Going to where the brown people are makes white people feel better, so of course, she left on a boat and was not seen by her kids for 30 years.Also, Let us return to the fact that this took place in the 1960s and Elna was married to a man who was alright with her sleeping out of the house for weekends at a time because she was helping out at orphanages. I kind of forgot to be surprised at that until I ended the book. It really is surprising. Cyril was actually extremely kind for that.Additionally, Elna had two maids at home. If she was that angry at Cyril for, I don't even know, providing for her and buying her a beautiful home, then she could have spent all her time cooking for the vague, unnamed orphanages she apparently went to every weekend. She could have taken her kids with her to teach them to be more helpful and kind. I don't know. Patchett's entire premise is flimsy and reads like a voyeuristic view of what she thinks a well-meaning rich person would do.I am the kind of person who goes through her history with a fine-tooth comb. I find it hard to forgive, and even harder to forget. Forgiving Elna and bringing her back into the fold? Could not be me. But, maybe, if I was 50 years old like Maeve. If I had been like Maeve, 30 years on, and pretty starved for the attention of a mother. Maybe I could understand forgiving Elna and letting her back into my life.It was a bittersweet ending for “The Dutch House”, but I would still recommend reading it. I am giving it 4 stars in spite of Elna, her thinking, her presence, her “selflessness” which, in fact, is merely selfishness disguised as sainthood. Maybe I don’t understand Catholicism enough to judge Elna’s actions."

This book was selected as our August book club selection so I went into it blind, and I was pretty much hooked from the beginning. I read this in one day. The story centers on Danny and Maeve two siblings who had the fortune (or unfortune) to grow up in the stately manor known as the Dutch house. The house is dark and gothic and is essentially a character. Their childhoods center around this house, their mother left because of the house, and when they are forced to eventually leave the house they can't keep away. What is the pull? Why does it matter? Maeve and Danny are two ultimately flawed and relatable characters, both of whom I grew to really enjoy - throughout the book they never grow apart and have a great sibling bond even as their lives change. A fantastic book with great ""villains"" and thoughtful questions. It's a title I will definitely think about often. "
479,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23473417-kelly,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book gave me a strange reading experience. Once the book was down, it would be a few days before I would pick it up again and I would have to force myself to delve back in, however, once I had picked it back up, I was completely absorbed and couldn't put it back down! I have never had a reading experience like it before.The book itself was a brilliant study of character; Danny and Maeve were wonderfully complex characters that grew throughout. I liked Maeve at the beginning but, as the book went on, I could see her selfishness amplified through Danny's actions and, at the end, I thought she was just simply a bitter woman without a purpose. I really enjoyed the expanse of time in the book, ranging from childhood up to late adulthood and that it was a good analysis of life itself, however, I did feel that it was a book where not much happened, just life which I guess is a good thing and the point? It was the structure that I felt let it down in places, especially when it came to the flashbacks as I didn't feel they were clear cut enough and I found myself having to go back and reread when I realised that I wasn't reading the same time frame.Overall I think this is a really accomplished book that is one where characters are explored in depth as well as life itself. It is one that will stay with me as it gave me a unique reading experiences that still confuses me even now!"
480,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25352638-theresa-smith,Rating 5 out of 5,"‘There is no story of the prodigal mother. The rich man didn’t call for a banquet to celebrate the return of his erstwhile wife. The sons, having stuck it out for all those years at home, did not hang garlands on the doorways, kill the sheep, bring forth the wine. When she left them she killed them all, each in his own way, and now, decades later, they didn’t want her back. They hurried down the road to lock the gate, the father and his sons together, the wind whipping at their coats. A friend had tipped them off. They knew she was coming and the gate must be locked.’This novel is divine. You know how you can sometimes stumble across a novel and it seems as though it has been written to perfectly match your tastes and moods; a six out of five star read. That is what this one is for me. Perfection.‘But we overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.’The narrative is character driven, and while there is a plot, it is not something that I could easily sum up if asked what this novel is about. Instead, my answer would be that it is about a brother, a sister, and a lost house and it is utterly fantastic and you should read it. As soon as possible. However, you probably want a little bit more than that. Nevertheless, can I just point out, it is Ann Patchett, and for me, that alone speaks volumes. She writes so well. What she does with words is remarkable and that is why there are so many quotes in this review. Her own words should tell you all you need to know about this novel.‘The idiocy of what we took and what we left cannot be overstated. We packed up clothes and shoes I would outgrow in six months, and left behind the blanket at the foot of my bed my mother had pieced together out of her dresses. We took the books from my desk and left the pressed-glass butter dish in the kitchen that was, as far as we knew, the only thing that had made its way from that apartment in Brooklyn with our mother. I didn’t pick up a single thing of my father’s, though later I could think of a hundred things I wished I had: the watch that he always wore had been in the envelope with his wallet and ring. It had been in my hands the whole way home from the hospital and I had given it to Andrea.’Danny narrates the Dutch House in a hindsight fashion, walking us through his life from infancy to the present day when he is a man in his forties. Yet, this is not just Danny’s story, and such is the skill of Ann Patchett that she is able to convey just as much about Maeve, Danny’s older sister, as she is about Danny himself via his gaze. I really liked both of these siblings, as well as their relationship, and over the course of the novel, I became so invested in their combined fate. What happens to them after their father dies is very shabby, and I have to say, I never accepted or forgave Andrea’s treatment of them. When Maeve and the family solicitor came up with their ultimate plan for revenge, I really got a lot of enjoyment out of it. That Danny went along with it was such a testimony to his love for Maeve. It is a certain type of person who can put his or her own dreams and ambitions aside to fulfil another’s destiny.‘There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you’d been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet in place, and for a moment you’re suspended, knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself.’No commentary on this novel would be complete without touching on the topic of their mother, whose absence was a looming presence throughout, a thorn that could not be dislodged. When she reappears, decades after leaving, Maeve and Danny have very different reactions. I was able to fully appreciate each one’s view, but I was firmly in Danny’s court on the issue. I could not forgive her and her reasons for having left in the first place just gave me further reason to not forgive her. I know what it is like to be living a life removed from what you thought you would be, but when you have children, you press on. You live it anyway, and then you go and do what you want after. The disappearing mother is a bit of trigger for me. Maybe that is part of why I loved this novel so much; I could relate to it so well.‘Making a mistake is not giving the floorboards enough time to settle before you seal them. Abandoning your children to go help the poor of India means you’re a narcissist who wants the adoration of strangers.’Although, I will say, being in a position where your husband just buys a mansion, still filled with the previous occupants’ belongings, even down to the clothes and kitchen utensils, and then presents it to you as a fait accompli; well, that is something else. There is a lot within this novel about the loss of agency over one’s own life. Their father took away their mother’s agency, and he repeated that with Maeve, who in turn took away Danny’s. An interesting cycle that Patchett played out with precision. I love this quote from Maeve:‘God’s truth,’ Maeve said. ‘Our father was a man who had never met his own wife.’So I loved this novel. And obviously, I recommend The Dutch House whole-heartedly. It is one of the rare few that I may read again.Thanks is extended to Bloomsbury Australia for providing me with a copy of The Dutch House for review."

Gostei de ler a história de Maeve e Danny , dois irmãos unidos por uma forte amizade e que vão superando as dificuldades que têm de enfrentar.

483,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4834343-martha,Rating 5 out of 5,"In this Rags-to-Riches-to-Rags-to-Riches novel, Danny recounts how his life (and every other character's life) has been shaped by The Dutch House, an architectural marvel in suburban Philadelphia. The house has a magnetism that pulls every inhabitant to the brink. Danny and his older sister Maeve are forever impacted by the house and what it means to them individually and as a family.After WW2, Danny's father, Cyril, quietly acquired The Dutch House, despite being essentially penniless. He had been looking for a way to enter the real estate market and this crumbling estate was his way in. When he presented the elaborate home, complete with a small staff, to his wife Elna,  she was repulsed by the grandiose gaudiness of it all. It went against everything she believed and what she thought that they believed together, as a couple.As a result of this non-meeting-of-the-minds, Danny and Maeve were raised motherless. Eventual victims of Andrea, the evil step-mother, Danny and Maeve are banished from the premises. But the Dutch House never really leaves their minds as they regularly park near the house to conspire about their futures and reminisce.For me, Patchett has either left me singing from the rooftops or utterly disappointed. This is the former. I loved every word and I had to slowly dole out chapters to myself so as not to read it all in one go. It is beautiful in all ways. I especially loved Danny as the narrator, too much like his father in his lack of forgiveness and metered doses of affection. But ultimately it is Maeve who will stay fixed in my mind for a long time to come."

486,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2454496-dustin-the-wind-crazy-little-brown-owl,Rating 5 out of 5,"A novel about holding on, and letting go.I'm a fan of the magical writing of Ann Patchett and The Dutch House is no exception. A beautiful story of connections - the significant places and people that impact our life. I was impressed with the legacy of Cyril Conroy - of how he remembered the lessons of being poor, even after becoming rich, of how he treated people and how this legacy particularly affected his son, Danny. Maeve and Danny have a wonderful sibling relationship.I believe that as seen with The Dutch House, certain places can have ""ghosts"", kept alive by memories and stories. Favorite Passages:The Dutch House, as it came to be known in Elkins Park and Jenkintown and Glenside and all the way to Philadelphia, referred not to the house's architecture but to its inhabitants. The Dutch House was the place where those Dutch people with the unpronounceable name lived. Seen from certain vantage points of distance, it appeared to float several inches above the hill it sat on.________Not only could you see into the Dutch House, you could see straight through it.________""The house is a piece of art.""_______""The only way to really understand what money means is to have been poor. . . . . That's the strike you have against you. . . . I don't know how a person overcomes a think like that. You can watch these people all you want and see what it's been like for them, but that's not the same as living it yourself.""_______""The biggest lie in business is that it takes money to make money. Remember that. You've got to be smart, have a plan, pay attention to what's going on around you. None of that costs a dime.""_______When I'm in a charitable mood, I look back on this moment and I tell myself that this was the reason things played out the way they did. My father was trying to give me the benefit of his experience.My father was always more comfortable with his tenants than he was the people in his office or the people in his house.________They had all become characters in the worst part of a fairy tale.________Maeve and I were forever under the impression that we were moments away from cracking the code on our life, and that soon we would understand the impenetrable mystery that was our father . . .________The basement of the house was from another century. It bore no relationship to the structure that sat on top of it. In certain corners the walls devolved into piles of dirt. I had once found an arrowhead there. I would have dug around for more but the truth was I didn't like the basement myself.""Why do you come down here?"" Norma asked, half in horror, half in wonder.""I'll show you.""____""Do you think it's possible to ever see the past as it actually was?"" I asked my sister.. . .""I see the past as it actually was,"" Maeve said. She was looking at the trees.""But we overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we're not seeing it as the people we were, we're seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.""____The problem, I wanted to say, was that I was asleep to the world. Even in my own house I had no idea what was going on.____There was no extra time in those days and I didn't want to spend the little of it I had sitting in front of the goddamn house, but that's where we wound up: like swallows, like salmon, we were the helpless captives of our migratory patterns. We pretended that what we had lost was the house, not our mother, not our father. We pretended that what we had lost had been taken from us by the person who still lived inside.____""They put his knee on backwards. You remember that.""Someone put his knee on backwards?"" I shook my head. ""That must have been before my time.""Maeve thought about it for a minute. I could see her scrolling through the years in her mind. ""Maybe so. He meant it to be funny but I have to say when I was a kid I thought it was true. His knee really did bend the wrong way. He used to go to orthopedists all the time, trying to get it to bend the other way I guess. When I think of it now it's kind of horrifying."". . . .""Even if the surgeon put the knee on backwards, which, of course, isn't possible, we should probably be grateful he didn't amputate that leg. That happens all the time in war, you know. It takes a lot more time to save something than it does to cut if off.""Maeve made a face. ""It wasn't the Civil War,"" she said, as if amputation had been abandoned after Appomattox. ""I don't think they even did surgery on his knee. He said in France the doctors were in such a hurry that they didn't always pay attention. Things got turned around. Really, it's kind of touching that he could even make a joke about it.""____A kid with a backpack full of bricks kept turning to say something to his girlfriend, and every time he did he clocked me with the full weight of his possessions. ____The universe might have been expanding but the luggage rack was not.____Maeve looked back out the window to the house. ""Celeste has beautiful children,"" Maeve said.""Thank you.""""They look nothing like her.""Oh, would that we had always lived in a world in which every man, woman and child came equipped with a device for audio recording, still photography, and short films.____""Since when did you ever take a poetry class?"" I asked once we had climbed back in the car.""Since I saw her shove a book of poetry in her bag."" Maeve cranked up the car's useless heater. ""So What?""____On my way to look for a pick-up game at Mount Morris I became the sole beneficiary to an inheritance greater than my father's business or his house. My entire life snapped into sudden Technicolor clarity: I needed a building, specifically the one on 120th near Lenox, in order to be who I was meant to be.____The line was quiet for minute.

As soon as I said it, I understood what we were talking about._________After all those years of banging on a locked door, I found the door wide open._________Maeve and I had been playing tennis over at the high school when she broke up the game after a single crack of lightning. I had an aluminum racquet and she said she wasn't about to watch me get electrocuted during a serve, so we got in the car and drove to the Dutch House, just to check on things before dark.____I had remembered my life very clearly even since Fluffy cracked me open with the spoon.____""There was this horrible, feral smell, like a wild animal and the shit of that animal and the dead cousin of that animal all at the same time.""____""Fluffy said she'd just been passing through and she wondered if we still lived in the house.""""And you said No, I just stalk the place.""____After years of living in response to the past, we had somehow become miraculously unstuck, moving forward in time just like everyone else.____""I was afraid of the house. I kept thinking the VanHoebeeks were still in there, that they were ghosts. I just couldn't imagine the place without them, even if they were dead. I could barely make myself dart in there once a week and look around at the height of the day, so I didn't know the raccoons had eaten their way into the ballroom with all those fleas. They must have just hatched because there were no fleas when the banker came and there were no fleas when the Conroys came to see the house, but by the time they moved in the fleas were everywhere, you could see them hopping around in the rugs, on the walls. I wouldn't have blamed them if they'd put me out on the spot.""________As we stood there shoulder to shoulder, the dishes done and the most frustrating mystery of my life resolved, I remembered that this was the woman who had hit me once when I was a child.

I thought of what a better life it would have been had Fluffy gotten her way.________I could have been in that building every waking hour, every day of the year, and still not made all the necessary repairs: uncontrollable steam heat, illegal garbage disposals, one tenant whose daughter flushed an orange down the toilet to see if it would go, another who left her door open so her cat could shit in the hall, and the terrier two doors down who would always find the shit and gobble it up and vomit on the hall floor.

He said it was because Mr. Otterson's family was Swedish. ""Cold-weather people,"" he said. He saw Mr. Otterson as the Willy Wonka of produce. Once he was satisfied by a day of watching peas being sealed into plastic bags, Maeve would return him to his grandparents, where he would immediately call his mother tell her he wanted to work in vegetables. ________""Let's go to the house,"" Maeve said once we were back in my car.""Really?""""We've never gone over there this time of day.""""We've never done anything this time of day.""________A brigade of nutcrackers could come pouring out of the dark hedges at any minute and be met by a battalion of mice.

Then I realized she was my mother.Maeve's heart attack had lured her out from beneath the floorboards. She had not been there for graduations or our father's funeral. She had not been there when we were told to leave the house. She wasn't at my wedding or at the births of my children or at Thanksgiving or Easter or any of the countless Saturdays when there had been nothing but time and energy to talk everything through, but she was there now, at Abington Memorial Hospital, like the Angel of Death.

She pulled one out then handed me the pack so I could decide for myself, then she handed me the lighter. Soon we were each blowing smoke out of our respective windows.""As good as that dinner was, this cigarette might be better,"" I said.""If you did an autopsy on me right now you would find I am nothing but dark meat and gravy, with maybe a tiny vein of mashed potatoes inside my right arm.""

We had to keep it all in the closet with us.""____I had a mother who left when I was a child. I didn't miss her. Maeve was there, with her red coat and her black hair, standing at the bottom of the stairs, the white marble floor with the little black squares, the snow coming down in glittering sheets in the windows behind her, the windows as wide as a movie screen, the ship in the waves of the grandfather clock rocking the minutes away.____There was no distance between them, no recrimination. They were living together in their own paradise of memory.____I was looking at my wife and for just a second I saw her, the round blue eyes and yellow hair. The woman I had known for more than half my life floated in front of me, and just as quickly she vanished.____I wanted to see the past. I got out of the car and stood in front of the Dutch House again, and my mother came and stood beside me. For that moment it was the two of us, me and Elna. I would never have believed it would happen.As for what was coming, we were not made to wait . . .When she saw us there she raised her hands and began slapping them hard against the glass, her mouth opened in a rounded howl. I'd heard that sound in emergency rooms late at night: a knife pulled out, a child dead . . . We were frozen, the two of us outside and Maeve in the car, waiting for the moment when the whole front of the house would shatter into a million knives and she would come for us like the fury of hell itself.____""I had this dream once,"" Maeve said to me, and I started to laugh.____In my dreams, the intervening years were never kind to the Dutch House. I was certain it would have become something shabby in my absence, the peeling and threadbare remains of grandeur, when in fact nothing of the sort had happened. The house looked the same as it did when we walked out thirty years before."

We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we're not seeing it as the people we were, we're seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.” A slice of life book that touched the right chord with me. Narrated by Tom Hanks - Danny came to life along with Maeve, May, Andrea and Celeste. In life, objects become symbols and grow so much more in importance that it changes the lives of people. The author takes that premise to spin a beautiful melancholic tale of growing up and old - revisiting history through the prism of the dutch house.Danny and Maeve view the Dutch house as their happy place from which they were displaced by their stepmother Andrea. The Hansel and Gretel reference does not go unnoticed in the way they keep picking the breadcrumbs of memory to keep coming back to it at different stages of their lives. Their mother who abandoned them found the house an indulgence that was against her values and their dad saw it as a symbol of love. Andrea, the stepmother, viewed the house as a possession and what she wanted for her children. The relationships are close to reality and it feels as if the brother-sister bond makes everything else a side story. Nothing wrong, but then the other characters don't stand a chance to shine through. Felt connected to the story and hence loved it."

I learned about Ann Patchett couple of years back when her Commonwealth kept coming at me every day on Goodreads. I can only hope that her other books are as compelling as this one, because I may have found a new favorite contemporary author! Speaking of compelling, The Dutch House is just the right amount of drama, mystery and darkness. I was drawn to this book because of its title. Who is the girl on the cover? Is she Dutch? Doesn't look like it. It reminded me of Girl with a Pearl Earring. Is it like The House of the Spirits? So many questions only based on the title and the cover, I knew I had to read it and I was not disappointed. This is a story of a family, but cleverly intertwined with a history of a house. The book follows the perspective of Danny, a young boy growing up with his family in the Dutch house. His father, rich real estate entrepreneur, bought this lavish estate in the suburbs as a surprise for his wife. But the thing is - the wife and mother is nowhere to be found. Danny and his sister Mauve have a strained relationship with their father, which is slowly untangled for us as we learn more about the Dutch house. Danny and Mauve are wonderfully written characters and I had no choice but to sit back and admire Ann Patchett's crafting skills. Danny was sensitive introvert, while Mauve was self-assured, loving and protective sister. I loved their relationship! They often joined in an exploration of the history, craving to learn more and scared of what is true. They had such a deep impact on each others lives that everyone around them felt isolated and less important. Growing up without a mother and a distant father, left the siblings only to each other. Ann Patchett slowly revealed clues and details that Danny's and Mauve's emotional issues have gradually emerged only by the end of the book. Shocking revelations were done so discreetly that I had to go back to read the jaw-dropping sentences one more time. Even if, for any reason, you don't enjoy the story, there is no way that you could overlook Patchett's talent.This is a psychological portrait of abandonment and its consequences. All wrapped in a story of a house. If you enjoy metaphors, looking for hidden meanings and reading between the lines - this should go on your must-read-right-now list!I got this edition through Edelweiss, thanks to Harper Collins!"
492,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44143662-evie-braithwaite,Rating 4 out of 5,"On the simplest level, ‘The Dutch House‘ by Ann Patchett tells the story of a Gatsbyesque mansion and, across five decades, captures the indelible bond between brother and sister. In a rags-to-riches move into a glorious, neo-classical home, it should be the beginning of a comfortable, happy life for the Conroy family. However, the house harbours family tensions behind its luxurious façade. Danny and Maeve’s mother flees without warning when they’re both still young, leaving them with their cold, distant father. Enter evil stepmother, Andrea, and her precious daughters and the end of Danny and Maeve’s childhood follows suit.‘The Dutch House’ is a slow burn, yet incredibly immersive. It begins with Danny’s memory of the first time he met his requisite wicked step-mother, Andrea. This almost has a fairytale quality in that it was the day where ‘everything’ seemed to change. Indeed, she separates the siblings from their father, their house, and everything they hold dear. Accordingly, we see how Danny and Maeve make a ritual of parking outside their former home. For decades, the grand old mansion acquires an emblematic role in their lives: it represents their childhoods, their father, his marriage. Yet, as Danny continues to recall the memories of his youth, he questions the very veracity of them:“But we overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.”As he grows older, he reassesses certain moments and figures of his past, discovering hidden complexities in what had first appeared to be unremarkable occurrences. The glass-walled Dutch House may offer every passer-by a glimpse inside, but the truth it contains is obscured.Family sagas never fail to captivate me, and from the first page to last, I’m invested in their characters. In ‘The Dutch House’ I resonated with Maeve in particular: flawed, funny, unapologetic. But all the characters who populate this book are memorable. The house itself even becomes a character in some ways. Patchett doesn’t waste words with architectural descriptions but brings specific features of the mansion to the forefront: Maeve’s window seat, the looming paintings hanging the walls, the grand staircase, she leaves the rest up to us.Overall, Patchett spins a true family epic that digs realistically into false memories, what it’s like to look back on places and people as an adult; a meditation on growing up, forgiveness, and mistakes. A spellbinding book with subtle mystery that anyone who loves family sagas will enjoy.Thank you Tandem Collective and Bloomsbury UK for my free copy in exchange for an honest review!"

Zupełnie nie wiem dlaczego, bo nie przypominam sobie, bym w ogóle o tej książce cokolwiek czytała. Z nieznanych przyczyn nazwisko Patchett spowodowało, że wrzuciłam tę książkę do worka książek 'nie dla mnie'. Zbyt lekkie? Zbyt proste? Zbyt wtórne?Jednak udzieliło się mi oczekiwanie polskiej premiery i postanowiłam sprawdzić nie tylko, czym jest ten Dom, ale o co chodzi z tą Patchett. No i proszę. Skończyłam i od razu wyruszyłam wirtualnie na zakupy po kolejne książki autorki. Czy mogę nazwać się nową fanką? Jeszcze nie wiem. Ale z pewnością Patchett rozbudziła we mnie przyjemność zanurzania się we wciągających książkach, które pisane są swobodnie, jakby opowieści te czekały na spisanie. Książkach, które w zasadzie nie zachwycają warstwą językową (tu nie oznacza się fragmentów, tu się namiętnie przewraca kartki), ale jednocześnie nie ma się w nich za bardzo do czego przyczepić. 'Dom Holendrów' opowiada o dwójce rodzeństwa na tle ich rodzinnego domu, który staje się pełnoprawnym bohaterem opowieści. To w tym domu Danny i Maeve się wychowują. To z niego ucieka ich matka (motyw matki marnotrawnej 👌). To w nim żyją ze zdystansowanym ojcem. To do niego przeprowadza się nowa partnerka ojca z córkami, by wprowadzić nowe zasady (kolejna zabawa motywami). I to w końcu przed nim, w samochodzie, po wielu latach Maeve i Danny przeprowadzają bardziej i mniej ważne rozmowy. 'Dom...' to dla mnie przede wszystkim piękna opowieść o rodzeństwie. Opowieść, w której porzucenie zderza się z lojalnością, chłód z ciepłem, egoizm z empatią, smutek z nadzieja. To historia pełna kontrastów, które nadają jej żywotności.To elegancka, niewymuszona proza, która nie ucieka w tani sentymentalizm. Patchett nie boi się nadawać swoim bohaterom negatywnych cech. Nie boi się włączać w opowieść ich pomyłek. Nie boi się iść czasem na skróty, dopuścić się pewnych uproszczeń. Nie boi się bawić chronologią, jednocześnie trzymając się złożoności i rozwoju relacji między bohaterami. I robi to z dużą świadomością i dojrzałością.Ann Patchett w mojej opinii fajnie łączy literaturę piękną z literaturą obyczajową. Plasuje się gdzieś pomiędzy literaturą popularną a wyższą. Jest świetną opowiadaczką, kreatorką bohaterów i kierowniczką ich losów. Przypomniała mi, czym jest czytanie dla samego czytania, pełnej rozrywki, wnikania w odrębne światy i tej ekscytacja towarzyszącej połykaniu kolejnych stron. Bardzo mi się ta Patchett podoba."

Afterall, who’s family doesn’t have drama? I was unimpressed with the first half. It was slow. Not much happened. It was just siblings Danny and Maeve reminiscing about all the bad times and forming a strong bond due to being abandoned by their mother, then suffering the cliché evil step mother. The one trait almost all characters shared were that they were clamped up. It was layer upon layer of ice. There are all these gaping questions, with plenty of people around who have answers and yet no-one wants to really ask or tell. That made tough reading for me. I need at least a trickle of meltwater to keep me amused. Half the bookclub agreed that the first half was less engaging but the others liked the slow build up of tension. Everyone agreed that the writing was good, the picture was well-painted. The message touched a few notes. I will just state early, the ratings were 4, 4, 4, 3.5 and my 2.5. It could be that I had just had a tooth removed during my uni break and wasn’t in the mood for hating a whole bunch of awful characters (other than the siblings). It could be that abandonment is an issue in my immediate family (I won’t get into that) therefore I couldn’t accept some key turn of events. Having said that there is one Maeve-like and three Danny-like people in my family, (in relation to the original Mrs Conroy). I really don’t think the ending was believable and it spoiled some of the build up. Christians may be more accepting of the ending but I thought “not a chance”. As expected, one of us said that what the kids went through was not good but why do mothers get judged more harshly than fathers who don’t take responsibilty for their children.Another related to Maeve from a diabetic point-of-view. But was sick and couldn’t elaborate too much.The others thought everything was viable and that families do crazy things to eachother and how trauma is generational.So at the end of the day, it was easy to read, I rolled my eyes several times but not as much as usual, the second half was faster paced and more interesting, though became ridiculous, it did get me thinking about the generational abandonment issues in my family (so that could be good or bad but probably more bad as I have moved on from all that and don’t want to go back there). I would suggest it for bookclubs, grief-lovers, and family-drama-lovers. "
495,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5889162-marlene,Rating 5 out of 5,"This novel presents an intimate portrait of a dysfunctional family including two siblings, Danny and Maeve, who find the sense of “home” in each other when their parents failed to nurture them. Their mother believed that her social responsibilities always came first even to the point of neglecting her family and eventually abandoning her children. Their confusion multiplied when their emotionally distant father brings a new wife and her two young daughters into the house. This stilted situation led Maeve and Danny to find refuge in their relationships with the maids and nanny. They were forced to grow up earlier as they navigated the uncharted childhood losses that bound them together and indelibly changed them forever. The setting of “The Dutch House” begins with a grand mansion, where former residents had died leaving behind their belongings including their portraits hanging on the walls. The house is such a strong and important part of the story that it plays the part of another character. As life moved on and Danny and Maeve thought they moved on as well but they couldn’t. A special piece of their hearts always stayed with that house because it gave them hope that one day their mother might return. Even when they are forced to physically leave, they never actually left and the house never left them but it left a vulnerable scar on their minds and souls. Even as adults it became their routine for years to stop their cars in front of the Dutch House watching for any activity inside or out. The story is narrated by Danny and the audio book is told through the fantastic and perfect voice of Tom Hanks. The subtle jumping between time-lines was confusing at times. Patchett’s insights into the complexities of family and her observations of human nature are exceptional. The author’s smooth writing style, vivid characterizations and amazing story-telling ability kept me totally captivated throughout."

Fast forward three months and here we all are, barely able to leave our homes, much less think of moving across the globe. Joke’s on me. I did move to a new place, though. Now this new pad and I are joined at the hip.This book is also about moving, specifically, the eviction of two young people by their stepmother. I should have been getting Cinderella and Snow White vibes, but it put me more in mind of The Sound of Music (novice reluctantly leaves the convent when love comes knocking), The Royal Tenenbaums (tragic, deadpan siblings), and Franny and Zooey (it’s been too long, but I think tragic, deadpan siblings as well). What it reminded me of most, though, was Kawabata’s Beauty and Sadness, with memories immortalized in a mythology that keeps the nostalgic rememberers trapped, forever looking aft.A page-turner with an easy flow, but what sunk this for me was the dry, unsophisticated writing and mood. This is not the style that I’ve admired in other books by Patchett. I found it monotonous and bland, with the narrator endlessly droning on in an indifferent catalog of the bric-a-brac of his life. The schtick is two adult siblings sitting in a car outside their childhood home, practically stalking it, for decades, nursing their very boring lifelong grudges. So much repetition of fetishized anecdotes, like a dog sucking a bone to nothing, while key and profound questions are left unengaged. There’s no momentum or beauty, and I didn’t believe in any of it.Though I did kind of enjoy imagining that I was getting to see how Edna Pontellier’s children turned out, learning what they really thought of their mother’s abandonment at middle age. But those were my flights of fancy, not the author’s."

Let’s start with a random thought first- it felt a little strange reading a book narrated by a man! I realized that a majority of the books I read are centered on female characters, so I definitely took note of the male presence here.It’s a book about a brother and sister, Danny and Maeve, the house they grew up in, and their family dynamics. The house is such a looming character in this novel and I felt they were obsessed with it, both in the past and the present.I really enjoyed reading about the relationship between Maeve and Danny and the way they took care of each other. She was his main family and he was hers. As the oldest, I’ve always felt like the second mother and guardian of my siblings, and so I could relate to Maeve in that way.The timeline was a little confusing for me as this book takes place across several decades and Danny is often jumping around in time as he’s telling their story. And as much as the house was such an important figure, while I could kind of picture it, I couldn’t fully visualize all of the elements. I think maybe that’s why I struggled a little with this book. While the house did seem wonderful, I found it difficult to connect with their obsession with the house. I found their childhood fascinating and compelling, but as they got older, I think I lost a bit of interest. Patchett does have that cleverly quiet writing style that I enjoy, but this novel didn’t fully grab me the way I was hoping it would. And I’ll end with a quick note about the cover- I love it! It’s so striking and I wonder if it is actually a real painting."

Il padre Cyril si risposa con Andrea, una matrigna degna di Cenerentola. L’unico momento in cui Cyril dimostra vicinanza a Danny è durante i weekend quando se lo porta in giro come aiutante a riscuotere gli affitti nelle varie proprietà, gettando le basi per quello che sarà anche il suo lavoro e passione: le case e la compravendita di immobili. Le case, anzi la casa olandese, presente fin dal titolo, è una presenza ingombrante, opprimente, che sa conservarsi e sopravvivere ai suoi abitanti, quasi una Hill House con una volontà propria.Un romanzo bellissimo, con protagonisti memorabili (Maeve su tutti), che parte in sordina e conquista lentamente e che parla senza banalità di famiglie e dei danni provocati dall’incomunicabilità, dal disinteresse, ma anche della necessità di mettere da parte i rancori quando si è costretti a perdonare, il tutto senza tanta retorica."

501,no user info,Rating 3 out of 5,The Dutch House is a gaudy mansion built to announce the newly acquired wealth of a 19th century family. It is the manifestation of the aspirations of an ambitious WWII vet. It is the crushing weight that threatens to destroy his young wife who longs to serve among the poor. It is the shimmer that lures an avaricious young woman into the role of second wife and step mother. It is the magnetic pull that draws and constantly realigns the lives of two aging siblings who grew up beneath its roof. The Dutch House is not so much a character in this family story as it is a force that blindly pulls and pushes the characters who encounter it. The power it exerts does not distort but rather brings into sharp relief the personality and disposition of each character. This is a slow book with an understated emotional voice. The characters do not develop significantly. Most have little to no depth. Those whose behaviors are the most incomprehensible early in the book remain an enigma throughout. 
502,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13040717-louise,Rating 5 out of 5,"I've loved every Ann Patchett book I've read, and this is no exception. It's the story of two siblings, Danny and Maeve, whose mother who has fled to India to help the poor, leaving her children with their successful, property-developer father in an ostentatious house (the Dutch house of the title) to be nurtured by the household help—Fluffy, Sandy and Jocelyn. Their father weds Andrea, who, it soon becomes clear, is a scheming, greedy stepmother. When their father dies, Andrea takes everything to which Danny and Maeve were entitled, including the house. But this is more than a story of wicked stepmothers. It's about wealth, greed and forgiveness, about good men who don't know how to be husbands and fathers, and about women exercising power in the only way they can. Mostly, though, it's a story about sibling love and devotion that will sweep you along to one of the most beautiful final scenes I've ever read in a book."

Some reviewers have said that they felt frustrated “waiting for something to happen”. To me, though, SO MUCH happens in this novel, just not in a fast-plot, big drama kind of way. Patchett’s multi-generational story line gently unfolds, slowly revealing the truth about Maeve and Danny’s abandonment, exploring their relationship through adult life, and finally allowing each of them to let go of their past. Reading this book is a bit like doing a psychological jigsaw.... slowly putting the pieces together and trying to understand why each character behaves as they do. Subtle, gripping and with undercurrents of a fairytale."

Maeve, as the older sibling, becomes Danny’s mother, advisor and protector. As the pair grow up and are exiled from their home, we see how their co-dependence impacts on their adult lives and relationships. In our reading group we discussed that the novel has all of the elements of a modern fairytale. The Dutch House is the castle, the children are effectively orphaned, there is a very wicked step-mother and a revenge of sorts. This is a narrative driven by its characters and the relationships between them. Ann Patchett’s unpretentious writing style lulls the reader into a false sense of simplicity and all the while there are spider webs of emotion being spun to gently entrap you without you ever even knowing."

This is my first Ann Patchett read - and I tell you it won't be the last.

A novel that is beautiful, heartbreaking, fast-paced - I could've easily finished this in one sitting if life didn't get in the way -, immersive and touching. I loved the characters, their bonds and their journey through life. And I loved the Dutch House.I also gotta admit that the audiobook played a role in me enjoying this as much as I did. The choice of Tom Hanks to be the narrator is so on point; he added so much character and life to the story. I throughly enjoyed the novel from start to end. "

""The Dutch House"" is everything an Ann Patchett reader could expect of hope for--deep, real, heartfelt relationships, delicious writing, humor, and a satisfying full circle at the end. This is the kind of novel that you crave to get back to and while you're reading, wish could go on forever. But Patchett knows what she's doing. She leaves us wanting more. I hope she's at her desk right now working hard on whatever she has next for us.I am so grateful to the publisher and Edelweiss for approving me to read and review ""The Dutch House."" In a year of so many fine novels, it is a stand-out.~~Candace Siegle, Greedy Reader"

Principal, como elemento agregador, foco de desentendimento, de ódios e amores de todas os restantes.Este livro é, também, uma forma de nos mostrar como tudo nas nossas relações inter-pessoais é mutável e relativo. É, também, uma forma da autora nos mostrar de como de uma ideia simples se contrói uma narrativa magistral, cheia de vivacidade e onde a caracterização dos personagens joga um papel preponderante que nos permite revermo-nos em cada um deles.Excelente.

In ‘Het Hollandse huis’ ontstijgt ze haar oerdegelijkheid met het schouwspel rond een herenhuis in Philadelphia, een weggelopen moeder, een doortrapte stiefmoeder en een onvergetelijke broer-zusrelatie. Dankzij een verbluffend slotstuk over het diepmenselijke duel tussen obsessieve nostalgie en wrok versus verzoening en genade tilt de Amerikaanse het scenario van dertien in een dozijn naar een familiekroniek uit duizend."

No puedo decir que sea malo, está bien escrito, se lee con facilidad, incluso te llega a enganchar en cierto modo.....pero hay algo que falla: la historia circular de tres generaciones de una familia en torno a una casa familiar no es demasiado creíble, el tema de la madrastra mala está muy manido, los personajes no me acaban de enganchar. No sé, me ha parecido como una historia Neoyorquina de Auster, pero sin intensidad y devaluada. Espero no desanimar a nadie, insisto no es un mal libro. "

535,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2697302-maine-colonial,Rating 4 out of 5,"A sort-of wicked stepmother fairy tale, implicating Patchett’s usual theme of the main character(s) having their lives suddenly disrupted. But the underlying themes are love, hate and forgiveness. Not in big sweeping terms, but these emotions in all their varieties. One person’s love doesn’t look like another’s, and that’s especially true of forgiveness. And even the same person can travel through different phases and types of love and forgiveness. Although these characters are nothing like anybody I’ve ever known, it’s still an immensely relatable book.This would make an excellent book club choice. Although the story is told in Danny’s voice, the story is dominated by women—his mother and stepmother, his sister and his wife—his relationship with them and theirs with each other. There is so much to chew over about these characters and their relationships.About the audiobook: I decided to get the audio version of the book because I was intrigued by the idea of Tom Hanks being the narrator. Actually, when voicing the opening credits, Hanks says the book is “performed” by Tom Hanks, rather than the usual “read” by or, my favorite, “read for you” by. Well alright, I thought, let’s see how you perform.The answer for me is that Hanks’s performance is erratic and too performance-y. I want the narrator to bring the story to life; emphasis on story. Here, you’re always aware this is Tom Hanks. His voicing of Danny is fine, but his rhythm sounds a little too much like the Sam character in Sleepless in Seattle. And he does this very weird thing: at the beginning of each chapter: he goes to town reading the word “chapter” and whatever number it is. Sometimes he acts like he’s surprised it’s a new chapter. For Chapter 17, he reads “Chaaaaaaaapter 17.” This took me out of the story, made me hyper-aware that it was Tom Hanks doing the narration, and I couldn’t help but think he wanted to draw attention to himself in this way.I also got the impression that he didn’t read each chapter to himself before performing. Numerous times his emphases were off. I appear to be in the minority, but I came away wishing I’d gotten the print version of this book rather than the audio."
536,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37980042-andy,Rating 5 out of 5,"I started 2021 well when it comes to reading. There wouldn’t be a thread of continuity in American literature without beautiful contributions like this.“ Mothers were the measure of safety, which meant that I was safer than Maeve. After our mother left, Maeve took up the job on my behalf but no one did the same for her.”“But we overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.”“There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you’d been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet in place, and for a moment you’re suspended, knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself.”“ And so I made the decision to change. It might seem like change was impossible, given my nature and my age, but I understood exactly what there was to lose. It was chemistry all over again. The point wasn’t whether or not I liked it. The point was it had to be done.”‘She shrugged. “I gave up caring where I lived a long time ago, and anyway, I think it’s good for me. It teaches me humility. She teaches me humility.” She tipped her head backwards the way Maeve would do. “You have to serve those who need to be served, not just the ones who make you feel good about yourself. Andrea’s my penance for all the mistakes.”’"

544,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48570258-kathleen,Rating 3 out of 5,"It's interesting why this book is so popular. I had it on hold for four months before it was available to download. When I got it and realized it was chock full of dysfunctional family members, it made me wonder why people like to read about dysfunctional families so much?? Is it because there are so many of them? Or they're from one?? So it makes us feel less abnormal? Whatever the case, this book exemplifies the human condition and despite its flaws, the crazy, mixed-up ways family dynamics are formed. Just for fun, I think we should review this book by dissecting the characters! Cyril Conroy = the most emotionally closed off/unavailable, uncommunicative, passive aggressive man. His strength was building a financial empire. The last people on his priority list ~ his family. We learned very little about his childhood so who knows how that contributed to forming his person? He was absolutely inept at talking to his children (or anyone else for that matter) so everyone was operating in a vacuum about what was going on in the family. He was married but basically behaved as an independent entity. If only he could have brought himself to 
converse,
 a majority of the problems that occurred, could have been resolved.The absolute worst person in the whole book (and I cut her no slack whatsoever) is Elna Conroy, the ""supposed"" Mother. You probably thought I was going to say Andrea ~ the step-mom??? Nope. She doesn't even come close to matching Elna. Elna should never have been pulled from the nunnery. She should have followed her first instincts, navigated her way there and never, EVER left the sheltering confines of those walls. It's almost impossible to believe, but Cyril must have had a brief moment of persuasive glibness to convince her to leave there and marry him?? It will forever perplex me how it happened?? I wish it hadn't. If this selfish woman wanted to help people, she should have helped her children. If she hated the idea of being wealthy, spend the fricking money on the needy. Make Cyril double down and earn more. Distribute it, buy food, buy clothes, donate it, whatever. I can think of infinite ways it could have done good, without her traipsing around the world in the guise of a homeless person, convincing herself she was ministering to the downtrodden, all the while totally screwing up her own family. I didn't buy that she felt any guilt whatsoever when she reappeared in the picture? It was narcissistic to expect mercy for her disappearance or for God's sake, be referred to as ""Saint-like"" for her actions??? Far from it, what a piece of work. Maeve and Danny. Theirs was a complex sister brother relationship but rightly so. The only two real victims of their parents foibles. I understand why Danny felt so compelled his whole life to be connected to his sister. Who wouldn't when that person was your anchor after every other stability was lost. Those two had only each other to count on and that's what they did. Was it unhealthy? Did they cling to each other too much? Probably. But who am I to fault them for it?? I might do the exact thing especially if I was Danny's age when I got thrown out on my own. As strong a woman as Maeve presents, she clearly had a void she'd long disguised (probably for Danny's sake) and lamented the loss of her Mother. I hated that she accepted her back without reservations tho and I know hate is a strong word. In this case, justified. I thought Danny had the more ""normal"" response in his feelings toward his Mother. In the end, I think it truly did kill Maeve that she only got her Mother back, to lose her again to Andrea. The poisonous Elna strikes havoc again, always looking to do good for anyone BUT her biological family. Is it obvious how much I disliked her? Egads. If the woman wanted to live a life of piety, she should never have been a parent. Danny's children and Celeste were the most grounded characters in the book. May was my absolute favorite. In the end, the house ended up in the hands it should have rightfully descended to from the beginning. It just took a huge toll on all their lives getting to that point. As beautiful as 'The Dutch House' was portrayed to be, it should never have had the power it was attributed nor dictated how the lives inside its walls lived. That's the sadness of this story. Everybody placing importance on things except what is truly valuable."

546,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29667871-inside-my-library-mind,Rating 2 out of 5,"More reviews up on my blog  Inside My Library Mind   Actual rating: 2.5 stars Let’s start with the stuff I enjoyed about this one. I found the writing to be really palatable and readable, and this book never was a chore to pick up. This is definitely partially because of the fact that I read this via audiobook, which Tom Hanks narrates. The narration was superb and I am starting a petition for Hanks to narrate every single book in the universe. So I was actually excited to get back to listening this one, and I wasn’t bored, which is something I usually struggle with in historical fiction. This book, however, is not a historical, not truly. This has no sense of place or time to it, and to be honest it could have been set at any point in history, since the point of this was to tell a family story. There were some plot points that referenced stuff that is relevant to the time period, but not many. That was great for me personally because if that was added on top of the issues I already had, I never would have finished this one.One other thing that worked for me (or at least in theory it worked) was Maeve. I found her character intriguing and I liked reading about her, so I could not help but wish we got her perspective here instead of Danny’s.Where the issues start (and end) with me is the characters. For a story that focuses solely on the characters and their relationships, these characters were unbearably flat. There was no character arc that made sense, not even Maeve’s. Not only were the characters underdeveloped (which is truly a feat to accomplish in a 340-page book where nothing happens), but they did not make a lick of sense. I was baffled by some of their actions and I struggled so much to understand their motivation. At times it felt like the author made characters do stuff that made absolutely no sense for them as characters just to propel the story forward.The more I think about this one, the madder I get, because I feel like this book had potential. There was a lot of room to do really interesting stuff with these relationships, but the book never went anywhere. Moreover, it felt into some really stereotypical tropes which I hate – like women hating each other for no reason, or step-parents being actually, comically, almost fairytale-esque evil. Seriously, what was the deal with that? Danny and Maeve’s step-mother was almost a cartoonish character from a Grimm fairytale and made absolutely ZERO sense. I was also frustrated that even Maeve, which I really liked, made decisions and did things that I could not justify. Mind you, I don’t care when characters are unlikeable or annoying, but I really do need to understand them, which this book just never manages to do.It was also frustrating that the house, which the title suggests will be grand and almost be an entity in itself, also never made an impact. I love when places are given meaning and when they exist independently of the characters but because of them, but even that wasn’t an aspect that I think was well accomplished in this book.This also lacked any sort of emotion or heart for me. I kept waiting for something to move me here, but because the characters were so poorly constructed, I could not find it in me to care. I cannot help but compare this with another book from the list that did not work for me – Actress. My issue with Actress was that it was too historical, it had too much description of parties and plays, but I did think it was well written and that the characters were interesting. Moreover, there was heart and emotion there, but I was bored out of my mind at times. The Dutch House was the opposite – I did not have any issue in finishing it, but the characters were mind-numbingly flat. To Sum Up  Sadly, this one did not really work for me. I felt like the characters were really flat and underdeveloped, and it’s really hard for me to care or like a book where I don’t care about the characters at all.

I could not put it down. Unlike Commonwealth, I think this one will stick with me, in no small part because of the cover painting, which was made especially for this book. This novel felt very Tolstoylian to me. "
548,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4999879-lindaj,Rating 5 out of 5,"Ann Patchett is one of my favorite authors. I have read all of her fiction and some of her non-fiction - all worth the read. My first Patchett novel was Bel Canto. It was so good, I immediately went looking for her earlier work and now routinely read every new book. She never disappoints me. This book is no exception. I chose to read this one in audible because the reader was Tom Hanks. He was a the perfect choice.This family story is narrated and told from the point of view of Danny Conroy, the son of Cyril and Elna Conroy and the brother of older sister Maeve. The book moves back and forth in time over a period of 50 years. Danny, Maeve, and the Dutch House are the lead characters. Cyril bought the Dutch House while still in the military just after WWII. It was a mansion built by a Dutch family who made their money in tobacco. But the sons were killed in the war, the husband died, and finally there was only the wife. The daughter (Fluffy) of one of the servants from the glory years cared for her and when she died, Fluffy became the caretaker. When Cyril bought the house, he hired Fluffy as a nurse for daughter Maeve. Cyril loved the house. Elna hated it - it was just too opulent. Elna did not know how Cyril had come up with the money to buy it. She did not know he was among the new rich. When Danny was about 2 years old, Elna left to become a missionary in India. Maeve, six years older than Danny, was devastated. Danny did not remember his mother. Maeve pined for her. Two sisters, hired by Elna to keep the house up, are like members of the family and never loose their connection to Danny and Maeve.Cyril marries Andrea Smith, a widow with two young daughters - Norma and Brit. Andrea loves the house. Andrea dislikes Maeve very much and, to a slightly less degree, Danny. Every Saturday, Danny and his father collect the rent from their tenants and, as Danny moves into his teen years, Cyril involves Danny in his building projects. Maeve, super-smart, seems to never have her father's attention. Disaster strikes when in his early 50's Cyril dies. Suddenly, Maeve and Danny find themselves on the outside of the Dutch House looking in. Maeve is the most important person in Danny's live and that causes Danny problems in his relationships, especially with his wife Celeste. Maeve and Danny do not always remember things the same (what siblings do?). Danny has no memory of his mother; Maeve has never stopped missing her. Danny does not hate Andrea; Maeve despises her. And so the years go by. Danny and Maeve are frequently found sitting in a car outside the Dutch House, watching and remembering, and always wanting their house back. But life goes on. Danny marries and has two children who love their aunt, even if their mother doesn't. Then as the story moves into its final part, there is a change. As always, Patchett knows how to build characters. She seems to have an understanding of the messiness of blending families. And she does a great job with memory - how and why it may vary. Excellent book."
549,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17074498-carla,Rating 5 out of 5,"I finished listening to The Dutch House, narrated by Tom Hanks and it felt like I was saying goodbye to friends. I am still thinking about this story, it's characters, the themes, and the house itself. This is something very different from anything I have read before. This is a modern day fairytale, complete with the evil stepmother, a father dying young and children exiled from the life they knew. The story is told from the point of view of Danny Conroy, the youngest of the two Conroy children.Danny Conroy and his sister, Maeve, grow up in a huge home that is the Dutch House, a 1920s mansion in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania. It’s a building with huge, wide windows, giving every passerby the opportunity to look inside. Danny's narration is a look inside the lives of the Conroy family. Cyril Conroy was a self-made man who bought the Dutch House and all its contents. His wife hated the house, and eventually left, leaving the children behind. When Danny is 10, his father remarries and moves in with her two daughters. Danny and Maeve love the children, they do not love their new step-mother and the feeling is mutual. When their father dies unexpectedly five years later, Danny is thrown out of the house to move in with Maeve, they only have each other to rely on. This is a story about family, decisions, forgiveness, obsession, dreams, and honesty. The Dutch House is as much a character in this book as the human characters as this story shows us how one family's dynamics are affected by it as well as each other. There were times that I loved Maeve and times that I was so angry with her. She pushed Danny to follow a path that was not his, but was for revenge. She also didn't take care of herself like she should have causing a lot of grief. Having said that, the relationship between her and Danny was amazing. This was sibling love that was far-reaching and unshakable. When their mother returns, it is heartbreaking to see how Danny's emotions are brought to the surface for a person that he really didn't know. This book is very much character driven, not plot driven. We go through the lifespan of a family and witness their lives. There are a lot of other characters, but they all revolve around Danny and Maeve. The Dutch House is a slow, but immersive story. Before you know it, you're drawn to these characters and want to know what's going on in their simple lives. It’s full of questions that invite judgement and decisions that demand reactions. It was a book that was not on my radar until I saw that Tom Hanks was narrating it and I jumped at the chance to listen to it. I was hooked by this story and definitely recommend it to lovers of family sagas, something a bit different, and even those who love modern day fairytales. Tom Hanks did an amazing job with the narration. He was Danny in my mind and I definitely recommend you listen to this one if you have the opportunity. The publisher generously provided me with a copy of this audiobook at my request. The rating, ideas and opinions shared are my own."

I loved her previous, family novel, Commonwealth and she takes steady, aim, on another family here, following the Conroy clan, in the suburbs of Philadelphia. With the son, Danny, narrating, we move through the decades, through heart-ache, joy and loss. Patchett's prose remains clear and effortless. She just keeps getting better."

552,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63602401-leah-agirlandaboy,Rating 3 out of 5,"SHORT REVIEW: This felt like a stranger sat down next to me on the bus and started telling me a series of disjointed stories about his life, but he was only doing it because his therapist told him to and neither of us were getting much out of it. LONG REVIEW: Let me preface this by noting that most of the reviews I’ve seen from people who loved the book seem to reference the audio version, and most reviews of the “meh” variety seem to be in reference the paper version, and so now having finished the paper version I will say: What a coup to get Tom Hanks to redeem an utterly robotic, unfeeling, bitter, distant, emotionless, incurious, developmentally arrested, uninterested-in-anyone-but-himself-and-even-when-he-realizes-it-he-doesn’t-change-at-all narrator! Yikes.I am truly baffled at how much...hero-won tenderness(?) I’ve seen directed toward a narrator who appears to think that by spending his life going through the motions and doing what people tell him, at least on the surface, he’s being a “good guy.” Several times he defends his “decency” in situations when what’s *really* being asked of him is some *humanity,* some honest-to-goodness authentic engagement with his life and the people in it. Instead, he does the “right thing” and then congratulates himself with the words “It cost me nothing,” but dude, the reason it cost you nothing is because you’ve invested nothing and are so detached you can’t even see it. Perhaps the closest he got to figuring something out was when he realized “We had made a fetish out of our misfortune, fallen in love with it.” As a story about how a traumatized child grows into a traumatized adult unable to feel or express emotion, this is okay, but was that the point? (Is Danny himself like the Dutch House—sturdy and impressive on the surface but ultimately hollow save the flea-bitten raccoons upstairs, in the room intended for celebrating with friends and family? #symbolism)Was this all intentional or am I just spinning? I highlighted so much plain evidence of Danny’s...misanthropy(?) or...perhaps clinically antisocial behavior(?) that it *feels* intentional, yet that doesn’t seem to be what other people are taking away from the book, so I don’t know. (I’ve only read one other thing by Ann Patchett and it knocked my socks off, soooo...?) Is it me or is it Tom Hanks? I guess perhaps my frustration is less with the book than with its reception? (Or at least what slices of its reception I’ve seen?) Ha. Classic me. If I write an actual essay about this, can someone read and grade it for me? This is why I’m such a spaz in book clubs. I’ll see myself out now."

A dysfunctional family that did not share anything, then a wicked stepmother made for an interesting life. Danny, who we hear in the first person and her older sister Maeve really did make memories in Dutch House”. Author Patchett has written a wonderful heartwarming story from start to finish. Great character development as the years go by and their memories all come back together. One of my favourite quotes from Danny” Then, I remembered what my father told me, that the things we could do nothing about were best put out of our minds. I gave it a try and found that it was much easier then I had imagined.” "
555,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4823153-bridget,Rating 5 out of 5,"Ann Patchett is one of my absolute favourite authors. I love her gentle but pointed prose and I look forward with eager anticipation for every new book. This book did not disappoint, the tone is so perfect and she drew me in from the first sentences. It is always such a relief when an author you love delivers you another book that you love.This is the story of a brother and sister, their mother has 'run away to India' as they are told when they are children. Danny and Maeve are left with their father, Cyril, in a magnificent house, a house which has remained largely untouched after the previous owners died, the house has personality, it is glass and from the street you can see all the way through it, nobody else in their town has a house anything like this mansion, but a lovely house doesn't necessarily mean a happy home. The children live there with their largely absent father and the housekeepers and cook who look after them as if they were their own. Maeve is considerably older than Danny and assumes the role of his protector and this continues all their lives. It is this relationship which makes the book so special. When Cyril brings home Andrea his wife to be, she immediately takes against the children, her jealousy and rage permeate the house, poison the atmosphere and when she comes to move in she arrives with two daughters that Maeve and Danny had no idea to expect. Why didn't Andrea mention at any point that she had two small daughters? Why has Cyril chosen such an unsuitable person to marry? Why is Andrea so incredibly spiteful to these perfectly pleasant children? The story unravels these mysteries and the stories of all of the characters.I loved these people, I became incredibly caught up in their lives, this is the gift Ann Patchett passes to her readers, an involvement in their stories and a deep feeling of attachment for these people, some of whom are difficult and prickly, but as you unravel the complex web you come to understand their struggles and trials. This is sitting right up there with my top books of the year. I'm off to buy myself a paper copy because this is a book to keep and to go back to. And I'm sure on the next reading I'll have a little sob in the same place that I did this first reading. Sigh. Lovely. Sigh.Thanks to Netgalley and Bloomsbury for giving me access to this treasure."
556,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21442406-frosty61,Rating 4 out of 5,"As others have said, this story of childhood abandonment and an evil stepmother has been told before, but it's still a riveting tale. The opulent Dutch House is the catalyst for events that forever change the lives of siblings Danny and Maeve. The track of Danny's life is determined by what happens after he and Maeve leave the house and are forced to figure out a different future than the one they'd imagined. His bitterness threatens to ruin any chance of happiness while Maeve orchestrates their future with revenge as the primary motivation. Their love for each other is the only constant in their lives. Memories of their childhood in the house are full of blank spaces and assumptions. As the story moves back and forth in time, the truth gradually emerges and narrator Danny struggles to adjust to the revelations. His life threatens to mirror the past unless he can move forward with acceptance, maybe forgiveness and self-awareness.Full of emotion that's hidden beneath the surface and a lot of symbolism, I found I really enjoyed the story. In my opinion there were a few problems with its structure. I liked the pace of the first 2/3 then it slowed down to a snail's pace until picking up again near the end. The flashbacks were confusing at times and I found I was much more invested in the present time period than those of the past. The descriptions were vivid - I want to visit the Dutch House, take a tour and sit by the pool. :-) However, an implausible event near the end of the story detracted a bit (though as others have said, it is a fairy tale). Though that event seemed far-fetched it certainly helped move things toward a more hopeful and uplifting conclusion. Otherwise, this would've simply been too depressing and dark for my taste. A favorite quote: ""There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you'd been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet in place, and for a moment you're suspended, knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself."""

Its a powerful narrative about family, misunderstandings and betrayal.Real estate developer Cyril Conroy buys The Dutch House an extravagant Pennsylvania mansion without consulting his wife Elna, confident that she'll like it as much as he does.Cyril is wrong, Unfortunately, Elna hates it with such a passion that she leaves it, him and their two children and goes off to do charity work in India, cutting all ties with the family.Danny, who narrates the novel in middle age, was 3 at the time, and so has no memories of his mother – but his distinctly saintly sister Maeve, seven years older, proves a to be a better mother anyway. Their distant father forms a relationship with the materialistic Andrea, who has two children of her own and, although he doesn't love her, he marry s her.Andrea treats Maeve and Danny with resentment and indifference When Cyril dies, she kicks them both out without a penny. Left with nothing, they are forced to fend for themselves and have only each other to survive.As the story moves along, the house becomes more and more like another character, creating tension as time passes, and representing the failures of the past as well as the shattered hopes and dreams for the members of this family, as well. As time passes, it continues to pull both Danny and his sister Maeve back time and again to confront their feelings of anger and their regrets over the past.This book is one that I will reread, reminiscent of The Gentleman in Moscow, its absolutely wonderful."

Het is zijn droom om hier samen met zijn vrouw en twee kinderen een nieuw bestaan op te bouwen. Helaas blijkt dit niet zo uit te werken, zijn vrouw heeft een enorme hekel aan het huis en laat het gezin in de steek wanneer de kinderen nog jong zijn. Maar dit blijkt slechts het begin te zijn van het leed wat achter de muren van het Hollandse huis verborgen ligt. Wanneer dochter Maeve en zoon Danny direct na de dood van hun vader verbannen worden uit het Hollandse huis wordt het hen pijnlijk duidelijk dat ze alleen elkaar hebben. 'Het Hollandse huis' wordt verteld vanuit het perspectief van zoon Danny en is opnieuw een prachtig geschreven familiedrama van de hand van Ann Patchett. Patchett bezit het unieke talent om je als lezer slechts in enkele pagina's mee te trekken in levendige scènes en ieder personage zo'n eigenheid mee te geven dat je bijna gelooft dat je ze echt kent en erbij was. Vooral de manier waarop Ann Patchett de traumatische impact van emotionele verwaarlozing naar voren laat komen vond ik erg sterk. Ze doet dit invoelbaar en oprecht, zonder daarin aan te dikken of te overdrijven, en dat is wat mij betreft een zeldzaamheid maar ook zo ontzettend waardevol, omdat juist dit soort emotionele traumatisering vaak niet gezien of erkend wordt. In dit verhaal wordt pijnlijk duidelijk wat voor enorm spoor dit achterlaat in de levens van Maeve en Danny. Maar probeer dit maar eens uit te leggen aan iemand die er niet bij was en die de slangenkuil niet van binnenuit heeft leren kennen."

""Холандската къща"" на Ан Патчет обаче ми хареса. Може би не чак толкова, че да ми стане любима, но е факт, че още я мисля, въпреки че я свърших още преди празниците.Историята ни среща с Мейв и Дани, които са брат и сестра. Майка им ги е напуснала, когато двамата са били деца и те цял живот се опитват да го преживеят. Баща им се жени повторно и това още веднъж преобръща живота им. Десетилетия по-късно къщата, в която са живели и която играе важна роля в решенията на всеки един от героите, продължава да е неизменна част от живота им, макар и от разстояние.Обичам да чета семейни саги като тази, защото са ми интересни отношенията между деца и родители, братя и сестри, съпрузи и новите семейства, които идват след брака. В случая ми беше забавно как Мейв и съпругата на Дани се опитват да си го поделят. 😄 Други теми, засегнати в романа, са тези за изборите на родителите, за спомените, за миналото, от което понякога не можем да се откъснем, за бъдещето, към което не смеем да пристъпим. Оценявам също и оригиналната корица, която от издателството са решили да запазят, защото играе важна роля в историята.

A place that is more than walls and floors. Like a hug from a loved one, it gives you comfort. It gives you security. It shares all your memories, your dreams, and your life - the good and the bad. It is a home that has come to define you. For Danny and Maeve this house was The Dutch House. Like Scarlett O’Hara trying to get back home to Tara during the Civil War, Danny and Maeve spend a good portion of their lives trying to get back to The Dutch House. Exiled from their home by their step-mother after their aloof father dies, Danny and Maeve forage their own way through life while constantly feeling the pull back to the past. Almost to the point of obsession, they return in search of what is missing in their lives from the Dutch House.Padgett has crafted a wonderful story about siblings and the things that bond us to a place and to each other. Great character building and story pace are just a few of the great things about The Dutch House. This novel is worthy of the high ratings it is receiving and, most possibly, will be considered one of Padgett’s finest works.

Danny's life is inextricably bound with that of his sister (and for most of the novel, only living relative), Maeve and with the Dutch House, their childhood home in Pennsylvania.I don't really think I can add much to what's been said in many of the excellent reviews here on Goodreads - this is a fascinating book, and a worthy nominee for the 2020 Women's Prize for Fiction.One thing I did find jarring - and I admit this is only because it's a pet hate of mine - was that, on two occasions in the text, the phrase ""could care less"" appeared, rather than the correct ""couldn't care less"". I sincerely hope that this was an error that crept in at the printing stage, as it's a pretty glaring copy-editing error.All in all, an enjoyable and thought-provoking read. Highly recommended."

Príbeh sa tiahne od detstva hlavných hrdinov, súrodencov (brata a sestry) až po ich dospelosť. V prvej etape románu tiahnu dospelí za kratší koniec ako deti. Danny a Maeve vyrastajú s mĺkvym a zaneprázdneným otcom, ktorý si po odchode ich matky nájde novú partnerku. Maeve sa tak stane pre Dannyho najdôležitejším človekom - prevezme úlohu ich matky. Vzťahy a atmosféra v holandskom dome sú čoraz viac napäté a napokon to teda vôbec nedopadne dobre. V dospelosti sa súrodenci stále vracajú k domu, pozorujú ho a spomínajú, kladú otázky a snažia sa prísť na odpovede. Danny toho potrebuje vstrebať podstatne viac ako Maeve. Obom sa to napokon podarí možno trocha iným spôsobom, no predsa len podarí 😊. Z deja nechcem prezrádzať viac, keďže sa v príbehu udeje veľa dôležitých zmien.Knihu Holandský dom určite vrelo odporúčam. Je písaná príjemným a nenásilným štýlom, číta sa sama. Príbeh nesie v sebe akurátnu dávku napätia, drámy a emócií, povedala by som, že je to jeden z tých „silnejších“ príbehov. Autorke sa podarilo veľmi pekne rozpracovať a napokon aj uzatvoriť veľmi dlhé časové obdobie, v podstate celý život hlavných protagonistov.

I will happily sit down with a cup of coffee and read her shopping list. I’ve read everything she’s written, my favorite being Bel Canto, and was overjoyed when The Dutch House came out.What I like most about Patchett’s writing is that it’s beauty is completely unpretentious. She wants her readers to care, not scratch their heads and wonder if they may be too dumb. All of her characters are multidimensional, with complex personalities, aspirations and motivations. The story is sort of a fairytale in which two siblings are thrown out of their house by a wicked stepmother after their father’s death. They are each other’s world and stick together all of their lives, and even after the boy marries and has his own family, they are both constantly parking outside The Dutch House and reliving their memories of it.Ultimately, their mother comes to them and shows herself to be (in my opinion) as selfish and inconsiderate to the sibling’s feelings as the wicked stepmother.This one is a gem, and I actually listened to the audiobook narrated by Tom Hanks, who was perfect."
564,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21437715-james,Rating 5 out of 5,"I had never read Anne Patchett before, and The Dutch House did not disappoint as my first foray into her work. The Dutch House follows Danny Conroy and his sister Maeve on a journey from childhood to adulthood, detailing all the trials and tribulations one family faces along the way. Beginning in earnest with their abandonment at the hands of their mother, it is the relationship between the siblings, and the building the called home, that is the beating heart of the novel. Despite spanning such long period of time, Patchett’s narrative picks us up and drops us off regularly enough that The Dutch House never feels too long. The warmth and familiarity that builds as the novel progresses draws one in as the reader becomes a part of the Conroy family, despite its dysfunction.I found myself not wanting to put The Dutch House down - reading into the early hours of the morning, and picking it up promptly upon waking, which is likely the best example I can give to demonstrate my high praise for this wonderful, almost classic work of fiction.

I looked forward to him as I drove in the car. I knew little of this book except that the house itself functioned like a character. And it did. The house lived in the DNA of a number of people who kept returning to it. It never changed, while the people around it did. The house was shared memory, the bond of estranged people coming together. Danny tells the story of his sister Maeve, but he also tells a whole host of other stories, most prominently his own. His father, his mother, Celeste, Fluffy, Sandy, Jocelyn, the Vanhubakes, and his children. The story is at times painful, at times endearing, but always beautiful and heartfelt. Much like this house stays with the people who inhabit it, the house and its story, and these characters stay with us in quite the same way. A five star read through and through. Just loved it, and it made my top ten for the year easily."

Ann Patchett's audiobook narrated by Tom Hank is marvelous. Tom Hank's voice is like a warm hug, satisfying and enveloping. There is a lot of subtly to this novel told from the perspective of Danny the son of a real estate entrepreneur. His relationship to his father and absent mother are very deep and well developed in the story. My favorite thing about this novel is Danny's relationship to his older sister and protector. There are so many layers that can be peeled back for book club discussion. For example, the effect of abandonment, forgiveness, and selflessness are but a few topics to discuss. Danny's sister asks Danny to forgive their mother for leaving them. She says and I paraphrase, I imagine all saints in history didnt make their families very happy either. I love it.

Not really; my favorites are still Bel Canto and Run, but Dutch House is right up there. As always, her characters, major and minor, are vivid, complex, and unforgettable; my favorite is May who, although she appears later in the narrative and is not one of the most prominent players, nevertheless embodies the resolution of the anger, unhappiness, and regret experienced by her antecedents in the story. The multi-layered plot has internal integrity; it has its surprises but is predictable, in a good way, in that events, sometimes disturbing but entirely believable, fit the characters perfectly. Metaphors abound, as the story starts (and ends) with the house itself. To some extent, magical realism has a role in much of Patchett's work, most notably in Bel Canto and State of Wonder; it's here, but is subtle, in Dutch House. A very satisfying and beautiful novel by a master storyteller."

A dark fairy tale, complete with brother and sister, clueless Dad and evil step-mother turns around the setting of an old house, which is both the familial home and the site of its undoing. Fragments of Patchett’s own life and her childhood under a cloud of divorce create the undertones of this story, which begins when patriarch Cyril Conroy buys “the Dutch House,” an elegant estate outside Philadelphia. When their mother takes off and a new stepmother makes the house her own, brother and sister Danny and Maeve find themselves impoverished and virtually cast out, both testing and strengthening the existing bonds between them in ultimate ways.

What makes this book so excellent is everything else about it. Patchett is at her best here, the characters area all fully developed, there is depth and there are many other good things.

They have such a strong bond, always there for each other, supporting each other. I also liked the relationship between them and the maids, treating them like family.At the end, this book teaches us that we shouldn't bear a grudge for people even if they were evil to us in the past.

He and his older sister, Maeve, have each other to work through their deep longing for lost family, symbolized by a house their father bought as an impetuous grand gesture.Ann Patchett is a master of the nuanced, detailed storytelling that lets readers feel they are part of the story, in the room or the car or wherever hearts are exposed and broken. This book is for readers who loved Patchett's previous novel, Commonwealth, and for anyone who loves a deep dive into a family's painful history.

573,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2650868-leah-rachel-von-essen,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Dutch House by Ann Patchett is a really lovely work of literary fiction that on its simplest level, captures a brother and sister battling an evil stepmother. Rich, complex, and twisting through time, this book is rooted in the close sibling relationship of Maeve and Danny. Older sister Maeve in particular, with her unshakable strength, resonated with me deeply, but all the characters who populate this book are deeply memorable. The novel leaves no one behind—not even the stepsisters. A true family epic that digs realistically into false memories, into what it's like to look back on places and people as an adult; a book about growing up, forgiveness, and mistakes. This one had me hooked from first page to last."

It is so engaging, with superb character development (even the house is a character!), and a really tightly woven story/plot. Loved it. I would call this mostly a family drama, with some coming of age elements. The protagonist is a man, who narrates the story from when he was a boy until his older age. And the main relationship at the heart of this book is a sibling one, which I found extremely unique in many ways. Although there are other books that have siblings in it and somewhat explore the relationship between a brother and a sister, this one was really strong. A beautifully written study of a brother and sister facing the hardships of the world together with humor and love. I will miss them! "

The relationships in this story are full of discussion potential.The Dutch House was originally owned by... some people from the Netherlands. Who would have guessed? They died and the house fell into disrepair. Along comes Cyril Conroy, a rich man who has bought many houses, and snatches it up.Cyril, Elna, Maeve and Danny - the Conroys. Cyril bought the house, Elna hates it, Maeve and her brother Danny are good with it. Danny tells this story, starting with their move to the house. The story spans 50 years. Danny is very close to his older sister Maeve. Neither can forget their past, based on experiences after they left the house. The past is negatively affecting their present.5 stars"

Reading the raving reviews of this book and its audio version made me wonder was the same one I had just listened to?!The story was intriguing at first, I was immediately hooked and had a lot of high hopes for a great read! However, one third in I kind of lost track of the purpose? I kept waiting for something interesting to happen, or a meaningful resolution to kick in, but it was honestly nothing but a lot of unrealistic incidents done by unlikable characters with absolutely no drive or clear direction of where the story is headed (and not in a good way).The audiobook was alright, Tom Hanks did a good job, but to be fair I have listened to SO MANY better ones."

This beautiful, benign mansion has a lifelong effect on the people who lived in it and the people who were forced to leave it. The novel is a tangled family tale with some very compelling characters who behave in ways that are often incomprehensible. As a mother, I couldn't understand the motivation of this particular mother; as a stepmother, I deplored the stereotypical stepmother! I couldn't really sympathize with the main male character, either. This was an entertaining read, although not one that I was eager to return to every time I set it down."

They grow up in a ‘Dutch House’, a lavish mansion that their father bought. The Dutch House made Mrs Conroy uncomfortable, having grown up in a poor household. When Danny is 4 and his sister Maeve is 11 years old, their mother disappears. Their father, a successful property owner, developer and manager divorces and marries Andrea, who has two daughters. Events occur bringing Danny and Maeve closer together. A very satisfying reading experience. Highly recommended.

However, the ending was brusque and offered little explanation for surprising subsequent events."

""We had made a fetish out of our misfortune, fallen in love with it.""
This isn't the type of book I typically read, so it's kinda hard to rate and even harder to talk about, but here goes...The Dutch House is the story of 3 generations of 1 family, the Conroys, during the latter half of the 20th century. A father buys the locally-legendary ""Dutch House"" outside of New York City in about 1950 after its creators and original owners, a wealthy Dutch family, all die and leave the house to the bank. His choice to buy a decadent home spins the family into a series of dramas over many years, narrated by Danny Conroy, the son who grows up in the Dutch House. His relationship with his sister, Maeve, and her relationship with the Dutch House and everything that happened there when she was young, are the main driving forces in this story.I won't share any more detail because pretty much everything beyond the Conroys first moving into the Dutch House is a point of drama/twist, which I suppose attests to the Dutch House's interesting plot. I did not expect to care so much about this story, I'll admit. The characters, at first, were nothing special, the story a bit boring now and then, and I remained skeptical for a while. But suddenly, things started to go ""wrong,"" and the perfect little family and the perfect big house became fragmented and increasingly unmoored. These conflicts revealed more about the characters, most of which I liked because most of them were women- I did not like the men much, which caused me to get a bit annoyed at the fact that one of these men was the first-person narrator.That being said, the core of this story is the relationship between a brother and a sister whose parents' choices around a house affected them for the rest of their lives. The Dutch House is an apt title for this book, because while the actual plot centers around a group of people, those people center themselves around the Dutch House. This makes for an interestingly-structured tale, with most major plot points having to do, in one way or another, with the Dutch House, even once the main characters don't live there anymore. They always find themselves there again, one way or another.Overall, most of this was good. I was invested in the story even though it did get a bit slow at times, and my dislike for the narrator was overshadowed by the fact that, by listening to the audiobook, that narrator had the voice of Tom Hanks. I also learned to love Maeve, the sister who becomes the true center of this story, maybe even more so than the Dutch House. While the Dutch House may be the setting of this story, Maeve Conroy becomes the primary actor on the stage. This starts out a bit slow, a bit strange, but soon the characters come to life and the secrets that made them who they are are revealed, and it was pretty hard not to become invested in this tale of family, memory, mistakes, and moving forward."
608,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37410306,Rating 4 out of 5,"Обърнах внимание на „Холандската къща“ не толкова заради това, че е финалист за наградата „Пулицър“, а защото някой ми каза, че като писане и атмосфера наподобява това на един от моите любими български автори Камелия Кучер. С��ед като прочетох книгата не съм сигурен до колко това сравнение е удачно, но определено съм доволен, че се докоснах до историята написана от Ан Патчет. Книгата определено ми хареса – не толкова, че да ми стане любима, но определено си заслужава четенето. „Холандската къща“ е роман, който те потапя в света си и ти наистина губиш представа за реалността. Заживяваш живота на героите, влизаш в техния ритъм, страдаш с тях, смееш се с тях. А това е лесно, защото историята е много човешка – въпреки че на Дани и Мейв се случват много тъжни неща, всеки от читателите може да припознае себе си в даден период от техния живот. Книгата ни показва как понякога наистина е добре да пуснеш миналото, да се отърсиш от него и да продължиш напред, защото когато си вкопчен в един спомен, оставаш на едно място. Тъпчеш без да се развиваш, а годините минават и като се обърнеш назад все още виждаш, че живееш в един живот, който отдавна не е твоя. Най-хубавото за мен в романа е връзката между Дани и Мейв. Те имат само себе си, но това е напълно достатъчно. Тази любов е над всичко. Тази любов просто няма еквивалент.  Историята е разказана от името на Дани, но за мен главните герои в този роман са Мейв и Холандската къща. Въпреки че в живота на Дани се случват много повече неща като учене, кариерно развитие, създаването на семейство, така историята е фокусирана върху Мейв и нейните мисли и чувства. Дори, когато разказва за своите случки, Дани споделя със сестра си, разказва на нас читателите тя какво мисли за всяко негово действие. Просто самата книга се основава върху Мейв и притегателната сила, която Холандската къща има върху нея. А самата къща е отделен герой в тази книга. Тя играе по свои правила. Къща, която толкова много привлича, но в същия момент и изключително много отблъсква героите. Къща, която е виновна за първоначалната загуба на Дани и Мейв, но и къща, която веднъж като посетиш просто имаш нуждата да се връщаш при нея отново и отново. Тази странна магия на това място продължава до самия край на книгата, когато по един ироничен начин кръгът се затваря напълно. Писането на Ан Патчет е много добро, но ме знам какво ми липсва, за да заобичам тази история. Не успя да ме грабне до толкова, че да съм ентусиазиран от прочитането й. Да, определено е добро заглавие, вече знам и на кои мои приятели мога да я препоръчам, но нещо ми липсва, за да има този огромен ефект върху мен, от който да нямам търпение да разказвам на всички за нея. За финал мога да кажа, че корицата на книгата е брилянтна, а ако я прочетете ще придобие огромно значение за вас. Препоръчвам да се потопите в историята на „Холандската къща“, защото съм сигурен, че ще ви омагьоса.Още за книгата може да прочетете тук ===> https://www.bookadventureclub.com/202..."

That is because she is a masterful storyteller, like John Irving or Stephen King. I don't require murder, running around, secrets or adultery for these books to be good. Instead they are talented enough to bring characters to life, to build emotional bonds and complicated chemistries and lifelong angst...and keep the reader riveted. I dare you not to pick up any of her books and fall in love. And she's done it again with her latest.The Dutch House is an old historical treasure located in Elkins Park PA, on the outskirts of Philadelphia. This house is where the patriarch, Cyril Conroy, a self-made real estate mogul, chose to raise his kids Maeve and Danny, with his wife Elna. But when the kids were 10 and 3 respectively, Elna leaves her family to work with the poor in India. While Danny doesn't even remember his mother, this abandonment devastated Maeve, and caused her health to suffer for a time, and even developed diabetes. Their father remarries to the wicked stepmother (haha), and once their father dies, Ms. Nasty Pants kicks the young adult Conroy children out of the house to fend for themselves. Maeve and Danny learn to rely on each other exclusively throughout their lives, and adult Danny, narrates the course of these lives in this story. One might argue that nothing ""happens"" in this story, but I found it unputdownable. The close relationship between siblings, even to the point where it gets in the way of Danny's marriage. How Maeve convinces Danny to go to an exclusive boarding school to finish out high school, and get his medical degree, in order to squeeze every penny from their father's education trust he left for his two kids and two stepchildren. The fact that Danny's only dream in life is to develop commercial real estate like his father. The deep wounds that refuse to heal from the abandonment of their mother and the treatment from their stepmother. And what it really takes in order to forgive. All a rich, thoughtful gift about human nature. I couldn't stop listening and I am in a malaise now that it's over. This book was a finalist for the 2020 Pultizer Prize for Fiction.The audiobook is sure to receive an award for Tom Hanks' work here. Seasoned actors tend to do amazing jobs with audios, and Hanks hits it out of the park here. He becomes Danny Conroy. "

It’s not one I would’ve picked had it not been passed to me at Book Club, and I was interested to see what the fuss was about. I didn’t love it - the writing is nice, but the story dragged, and there wasn’t much point to the plot, but I did finish it. Danny and Maeve have grown up in the architecturally stunning house in Philadelphia that their wealthy father bought their mother, who then abandoned them for reasons they have never understood. When their father marries a younger woman, then dies, they are evicted from the house, and spend the rest of their lives resenting their stepmother for the loss - but at least they have each other.The first third of this was really good, as the siblings stick up for each other against their greedy stepmother Andrea, who is really only interested in the house. Unfortunately the rest of the book, which is all narrated by adult Danny as a series of non-linear memories of the different stages of the next forty or so years, was not that interesting - Danny is bullied into studying medicine by Maeve but only really wants to follow in his father’s footsteps, while Maeve puts her life on hold to look after him.Not much happens until the end, then there’s a rush to make the ending sorta-happy. It was ok but I won’t be in a rush to read more of Patchett’s books."

Tom Hanks' narration is flawless. There were only a couple of times when the inflection in his voice made me laugh and say ""That's so Tom Hanks"" while visions of Woody from Toy Story and Joe Fox from You've Got Mail popped into my mind. I really loved listening to him.The story itself is like nothing I've read before. It seems like a gentle story of a brother and sister, their childhood, and their quest to be free of it. But it held within its chapters more drama than I expected. The characters are each so complex and believable, and the first-person narration refreshingly consistent after the omniscient, head-hopping POV I recently read in this author's Bel Canto. For character studies alone, this book would be worth studying, as an author who strives for robust and nuanced characterization.(Note: There's a handful of curse words in the book. I wasn't counting them while listening, but they were few and far between.) "

And after listening to this one via Audible, there is no doubt that Tom Hanks can narrate a book like a boss. This is a story about loss and forgiveness and redemption. However, I found The Dutch House to be equally enthralling and painfully slow. I absolutely love complex family dynamics stories that span many decades. I enjoyed getting to know Maeve and Danny; their bond was touching, yet somewhat frustrating at times. I loved that the house played a major character role in this story and the lives of Maeve and Danny. Having said this, I found myself desperately wanting/needing more from the second half of the book.This is my first Ann Patchett book, but after reading The Dutch House and hearing and reading so many accolades for her other work, I'm sure it will not be my last.

It's at the center of each character's life and crucial to the choices they make. The father is destined to make seriously bad choices from the day he buys the house. He'll marry two women, one who hates the house on moral grounds, the other who will sacrifice anything and anyone to own it. The children, all four, are left to deal with the wake these three parents leave behind, and no matter their success or failure, their choices have been strongly influenced by the ever-present Dutch House.As life unfolds over three generations of the Conroy family, Patchett sustains major threads of tension: the mother, is she alive or dead? Maeve, will she die young? Danny & Celeste, is there's another marriage of wrong choices? Andrea, what other devious plans does she have? This was an interesting exploration of family relationships, possessions, and the long reach mistakes can have beyond death."

Puedo decir que la narración es excelente, como un tejido maravillosamente entrelazado en el que no falta ni sobra nada; que es el retrato de dos vidas, dos hermanos a los que les ocurren al mismo tiempo cosas extraordinarias y las más comunes del mundo, las que nos pasan a todos: crecer, amar, sufrir, decir adiós y sobrevivir. Maeve y Danny son dos personajes que van a quedarse por siempre conmigo; con ellos he reído, me he indignado y he sufrido mucho, mucho; leer su historia, conocerlos a fondo, verlos crecer y enfrentar la vida ha sido una experiencia fantástica. La recomiendo de todo corazón. "

618,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71540326-lucypriest,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book has been sitting on my shelf for almost 2 years only God knows why I didn’t pick it up sooner.Narrated by Danny, The Dutch House is a family saga of sorts that moves back and forth through the decades with the Conroy family at the centre - but for most of the novel it’s just Danny and his sister Maeve. At the start of the novel Danny asks Maeve, “Do you ever think it’s possible to see the past as it was?…We overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know, so we’re not seeing it not as the people we were, we’re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past had been radically altered.” This is a book about the past, a past we can’t let go of and how it informs the adults we become. The Dutch house is the past for Maeve and Danny, their complicated childhood home that exerts so much influence over their lives it almost acts as a second sibling. It’s a character focused novel so, naturally, there are some complex familial dynamics going on but the reason I loved it so much is because of the strength of Maeve and Danny’s bond. The Dutch House speaks to the unique relationship shared between siblings; perhaps the only other person who can understand the full picture of your life. Maeve and Danny are so deeply wounded and all they ever try to do for each other is make it okay. I’m hesitant to reveal too much of the plot because I think this is a book you need to discover for yourself. I know Maeve and Danny will live with me forever.If I haven’t already sold you the audiobook is narrated by Tom Hanks. Happy reading."

636,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8300581-sam-sattler,Rating 4 out of 5,"Those who enjoy multi-generational family sagas that take place over a number of decades (me among them) are going to enjoy Ann Patchett’s The Dutch House. The story is told over a fifty-year period during which the Cyril Conroy family manages to go from poverty, to riches, back to poverty, and then back to riches again all without really trying very hard to make, or stop, any of it from happening. Passivity, in fact, seems to be a Conroy family trait – and going-along-to-get-along is not the best approach to dealing with a sociopathic gold-digger, a lesson Cyril didn’t live long enough to learn.The ominous tone of The Dutch House is set in the book’s first chapter when Danny, the narrator, explains how he and his sister Maeve ended up living in such a large Philadelphia home with their father and the two women (themselves sisters) who did all the cooking and cleaning. Cyril had purchased the old mansion, complete with every physical possession owned by the Dutch family that owned it before him, without telling his wife that he was doing so. Mistake number one. Mistake number two came a few years later when Cyril let Andrea, a woman eighteen years his junior, wheedle her way into the Dutch House for good. Andrea was not so much the stereotypical evil stepmother, she was more the indifferent stepmother. Indifferent, that is, until the day she was able finally to banish the newly penniless siblings from her life forever. Now Danny and Maeve have only each other to depend on, and Maeve literally takes to sleeping on the couch of her tiny apartment so that the taller Danny will have a place to sleep at night. Maeve, who has always been more mother to Danny than sister, is suddenly thrust into the role of being her brother’s only protector, a role she claims as hers for the rest of her life. Danny, on his part, deeply feels their special bond and is always there when his sister needs him.Danny and Maeve eventually get on with their lives but, no matter how hard they may try, neither can ever forget all they lost to Andrea and how the indifference of their mother and father allowed it all to happen. Now, the two of them feel most comfortable when sitting together in a parked car across the street from the Dutch House talking about the past and what was stolen from them. And for years and years, every time Danny visits Philadelphia that’s exactly what they do. But can they ever really be happy as long as they allow the past to eat at them this way? And what will happen to Danny and Maeve when they are finally forced to confront the people who treated them so shabbily all those years ago? Will they ever be ready for that moment?Bottom Line: The Dutch House is the kind of beautifully written novel that readers have come to expect from Ann Patchett, one filled with nuanced characters and (at times melodramatic) situations that will leave those readers thinking about them long after they have turned the book’s final page. Patchett uses multiple flashforwards and flashbacks to build tension all throughout the novel, sprinkling hints along the way as to what Danny and Maeve still have to endure before their story is finally told. And what a story, it is.(Perhaps it’s just me, but The Dutch House reminds me very much of the kind of novel I’ve come to expect from Anne Tyler, another of my favorite writers.)"
637,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33603612-chrissie,Rating 5 out of 5,"I was admittedly a bit nervous about picking this one up. While I loved Commonwealth, I had recently tried Bel Canto and found myself unable to finish it (or even really begin it, honestly). And that's all the Ann Patchett I had known up to that point. I wondered then if Commonwealth was just a fluke? A short time ago, I had heard on a podcast a host describe Ann Patchett's earlier works as more plot-driven (which she, the host, normally prefers), adding that Commonwealth and The Dutch House were more character-driven stories (which she liked less). But that is actually what I do prefer. So...with fingers crossed I borrowed this one from the library. (Also, I was hesitant because all I could hear was that the brilliant Tom Hanks was performing the audio version of this one and I honestly didn't want him dictating the words for me just yet. I'm very tempted, now that I have finished, to borrow the audiobook version of this one and give it a re-read.)The Dutch House is a wonderfully moving and explorative family story. With overlapping hints of Sense and Sensibility and The Goldfinch, The Dutch House delivers a touching and timeless tale centering around two siblings with plays on themes regarding loyalty, love, abandonment, forgiveness, and entitlement. This one was powerfully intimate and yet somehow not at all invasive.”Our childhood was a fire.”Danny Conroy, the narrator and younger sibling to Maeve (whose portrait is featured in the book and appears on the book's cover), is so relatable, so human. The ways in which he misunderstands himself and how he has actually processed his life throughout its different stages—specifically regarding his relationship with his mother, who is absent from his life after abruptly leaving when he was four—was so familiar to me and deeply reflective of things in my own life with which I have had to come to terms and analyze and re-examine.While Danny supplies some of the flawed human side to life, the allowance to have made the wrong assumptions and not even realized it, Maeve, his older sister, supplies the powerful backbone and self-sacrificing side. Almost acting as a single unit at times, their bond was absolutely heartwarming to read. Covering almost fifty years, The Dutch House breathes some fresh life into the idea of picking yourself up, dusting yourself off, and starting all over again."
638,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"The title of this book is what attracted me. I am drawn to anything Dutch; ice skating on the canals, delft, orange chocolate. So when I saw this book on our library stack, I couldn't resist. And it didn't disappoint. The story is of the Dutch House as seen through the eyes of the people who live in it. It is described as a beautiful older home whose original Dutch occupants are now deceased. The current occupants are not all so happy to be there. Cyril Conroy and his young wife have been raising their young daughter in low middle class circumstances. And they are happy. But life circumstances puts Mr. Conroy in the position of being able to buy this beautiful Dutch house for his family in the suburbs of Philadelphia. Unfortunately, he gives this gift to his wife as a surprise, not having consulted her before he bought it. It is instantly seen that she does not want to live in this kind of opulence. Elna becomes a mother who leaves her house every chance she gets, not to go out and have a good time, but to do service work for other people in need. She neglects her family which now consists of a young daughter and a little boy and ultimately leaves them to go help the people of India. The children, ages ten and three are left to be raised by a pair of sisters who have been hired to take care of them and the house. Maeve misses her mother most, because she had ten years of memories with her. Danny was only three when she left. Ultimately Mr Conroy brings in a girlfriend and then marries her. The new wife, Andrea, loves the house and when the couple weds she brings in her two young children to share the house.Here is where the Cinderella story begins. The stepmother wants only the best for her own two girls, and Maeve and Danny begin to be pushed to the back. When Maeve leaves for college, Andrea puts one of her own young children into Maeve's room, which has a window seat and moves Maeve to the attic. After her first visit home to experience this, Maeve does not come back. She stays with others and ultimately gets her own apartment. She becomes an accountant for a vegetable business after college.The story switches back and forth between Mave and Danny's lives and the life of the people in the house. When Mr. Conroy unexpectedly dies, Maeve and Danny are left alone, and with no fortune.There are five groups of various generations that live under the roof of the Dutch House. Every family grouping has its own idea of how it is to live there. We see the frailties of people and how they make bad choices. But the house maintains dignity and unexpected good happens. However, the story left me wondering how a mother cannot see the needs of her children because of the needs of the world. "

She doesn't fear talking and exposing how weak and frail our emotions are how beautiful and important any relationship in our lives can turn out to be.Pure joy to read, you should read if looking out for a fiction with wisdom, emotions and relatable human behaviour saga"
640,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23704706-cor-t,Rating 5 out of 5,"Ann Patchett finally got me with this one. I admit to having a bias against ""chick lit"" and being somewhat irritated by her previous novels. The novel opens in the midst of a family saga, when the narrator, an 8-year-old boy, meets his future stepmother as a first-time visitor (and supplicant) to the house. As he relates this tale in the first chapter, he also tells us that he learned about this time “many years after the fact, in a car parked outside the Dutch House with my sister,” where Danny and Maeve habitually meet to talk as young adults. Thus the reader is compelled to know: When was the house theirs, and why did they leave it?Though Danny has no memory of his mother, the story of why she left him and his sister Maeve at age four and eleven, along with the extravagant VanHoebeek (“Van Who-Bake”) House (and its belongings) that her husband, Cyril, ostensibly bought for her - a house he loved and a lifestyle that he aspired to, but one that went against everything she stood for - is the central question of their lives. When her mother leaves for India to help the poor (so the story goes), Maeve steps up to nurture and protect Danny, but at the same time develops diabetes. A few years later, the new stepmother comes along and kicks them out to make room for her own children, leaving them to the indirect care of the former housekeeper, cook, and nanny outside of the home environment. On a macro level, it’s a Cinderella story of stepmother threatened by a powerful teenage stepdaughter; in this case, the stepmother wins, but in the long run, everyone loses. Maeve’s health issues eventually pull their mother back into the circle and loose ends are tied up, though Maeve makes her peace long before Danny does.Why did I like this book? It’s a life story told by a member of a nuclear family which detonates seemingly from a single bad decision - the well-intentioned decision of a man to buy a house completely unsuited to his wife - and how that decision radically alters the lives that were touched by it. It reminds me of The World According to Garp, in which Garp’s single, quirky parent (a radical feminist), decides for her own reasons to raise him in an unusual (boarding school) environment: drama and trauma ensue. Patchett and Irving portray family life as unique for every member, each of whom has a story that can be made sense of in hindsight. I guess that works for me #realitybites"
641,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6199901-novel-visits,Rating 5 out of 5,"{My Thoughts}The Dutch House has cemented Ann Patchett at the very top of my favorite authors list. I have loved so many of her books including Bel Canto, State of Wonder and Commonwealth, but for me The Dutch House tops them ALL. Yes, that’s exactly what I’m saying. This IS my number one Ann Patchett book, but I can’t tell you much about it because I refuse to rob anyone of the wonderful reading experience I had as her story unfolded before me. I had intended to savor the story, to stretch out my reading of it. I failed. The Dutch House was just too compelling, too immersive. I got lost in her story and nothing else mattered until I’d reached the end.Make no mistake about it, The Dutch House is a love story, but a very different kind of love story. It’s the story of the lifelong bond between Danny and his older sister, Maeve. These are siblings who truly care about each other throughout their lives, often putting the other before all others in their decision-making. If there is any dysfunction between the two, it lies in that bond, but I found it very refreshing.“…then she turned and went back inside, leaving me to stand in the swirl of leaves and think about what I owed her. By any calculation, it was everything.”The other love story in the book is that of the relationship Danny and Maeve have with the house they grew up in, the Dutch House. To both that home means everything and they never can let go of their feelings for it, making the house itself a character in this novel. Herein lays the dysfunction in The Dutch House, some from Danny and Maeve and their joint obsession, but much more from the house itself, and the reasons for the siblings no longer being welcome there. That’s all I can say!“My father said we would pick Maeve up and the three of us would have lunch, then he would drive back to Elkins Park without me. It sounded so nostalgic when he said it, the three of us, as if we had once been a unit instead of just a circumstance.”Whether or not you’re a fan of Ann Patchett, I highly recommend you try The Dutch House. It’s honestly difficult for me to imagine anyone not loving this book. I already knew Patchett as a master storyteller, and this quiet, lovely story is further proof of that.Grade: A BONUS INFO: If you’re a fan of audiobooks, you might want to listen to this one.

642,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1223942-keith-taylor,Rating 4 out of 5,"Not that Ann Patchett needs any help from me, but here's a short review I did of her most recent book, which was a lot of fun to read:Ann Patchett writes good stories, the kind that catch us and keep us interested, that build to emotional climaxes and invariably are moving, even when we guess the ending that might be coming. She creates characters who feel real and whom we care about as well as any novelist working. But there is something unique in each of Patchett’s novels–an idea or image or event–that never quite recedes to the background and that shapes the characters and their actions. In Bel Canto, her most famous novel, beautiful music underlaid all the conflict and relationships. Even readers who knew little or nothing about opera found themselves interested in the intricacies of fine singing. State of Wonder, from earlier in this decade, layered science and the discovery of new medicines under its character studies and intrigue.Patchett’s new novel, The Dutch House, features, as you might guess, a house. Immigrant merchants built the place after they made a fortune distributing cigarettes during World War I. The house is large and ornate, bordering on ostentatious, but art nouveau ornamentation keeps it from being tacky. As Danny Conroy, the son of a seemingly heartless developer and narrator of the book, says as he approaches the house after thirty years away, “I had known … that the world was full of bigger houses, grander and more ridiculous houses, but none were so beautiful.” Most, but not all, of the Conroys, its current residents, who made their money in New York real estate after the next world war, are oppressed by the place.But the overriding theme of The Dutch House is forgiveness, particularly the kind that is necessary within families. Danny and his sister, Maeve, were abandoned by their mother, who could not live in the new affluence her husband’s success created and the house he chose for his family. Instead, she traveled the world dedicating her life to the poor, while leaving her own children to the ministrations of a troubled stepmother. Though that stepmother trope seems a bit too obvious, she too becomes part of what must be forgiven. And then that trauma of forgiveness centers in the house, becoming an overriding presence, one that each character must learn to live with, even when they cannot accept it.https://annarborobserver.com/articles..."
643,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7630898-bonnie-brody,Rating 4 out of 5,"I love Ann Patchett's depth of characterization. She can, and does, give life to both the animate and inanimate objects she writes about. This book is as much a story of 'the Dutch house' as it is of the people who inhabit it. The novel encompasses several generations of the Conroy family as they deal with issues that many people grapple with during their lifetimes - difficulty communicating within the family, sickness and health, economic concerns, step parenting, sibling relationships, and what it means to feel at home where you are and within yourself.Cyril Conroy, the story's patriarch has hidden riches that his wife knows nothing about. He is a penny pincher but he's also made excellent investments in real estates. He purchases the Dutch house for his wife Elna and she ends up hating it. Prior to Cyril's purchase, the house was owned by the VanHoebeek family and it was sold with all their possessions still in the house. Portraits of the VanHoebeeks stare at the Conroys from over the fireplace mantle and, while the size of the house is enormous, parts of it are falling apart and it is in general disrepair. How the Dutch house contributed to the undoing of the Conroy family is a central theme of this novel.The novel is told in Danny Conroy's voice, the younger of the two Conroy children. His sister Maeve is seven years his senior. Shortly after moving into the Dutch house, Danny and Maeve's mother leaves. Supposedly, she goes to India but no one is certains. Maeve cares for Danny in most practical and emotional ways, a practice that continues well into adulthood. Maeve is diabetic and after her mother leaves, she gets very ill.Cyril hitches up with Andrea, a gold digger with two children who is cold to Danny and Maeve. She loves the Dutch House and everything in it. Danny and Maeve hate her and develop and animosity and taste for revenge that rests with them like an albatross.I won't say more about the story line except to point out that Ms. Patchett writes beautifully. The first half of the novel ran with the wind as I tried to keep up. The second half lagged and I couldn't stand the denouement. I felt like the ending was tacked on, perhaps due to some personal issues that the author has experienced of witnessed. I rate the writing and first half of the book a 5 while the second part is a low 3 for the thematic elements. It just didn't ring at all true to me."
644,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2025739-jess-clayton,Rating 5 out of 5,"Ann Patchett has become one of my favorite authors in recent years. She is a master storyteller with a unique talent for writing intricate character studies. This is my favorite book of hers so far; I think it is a perfect summer read for anyone who enjoys an absorbing family drama!Short plot summary: The story revolves around a grand mansion in Philadelphia that was purchased in 1946 by a real estate tycoon, Cyril Conroy, for his wife. The house is named ""Dutch House"" after the family who first owned it and left everything in it, including their portraits and personal belongings. Danny and Maeve are siblings who were raised by their father and the household help in the elaborate house after their mother abandoned them when they were young. Their father is so preoccupied by his job that he remarries a much younger woman to help with his children. She treats the siblings with hostility and eventually cuts them off when their father dies suddenly. They find themselves homeless, living in poverty and forced to start over when all they've ever known is a life of luxury in the Dutch House. As you can imagine, the house made quite an impact on their lives and they find it difficult to let go of the house and their childhood within it. If it sounds like a fairy tale, it's not. It is more of an retrospective story about forgiveness and how our childhood reflections can alter how we see people and whether we, as adults, should reconsider that. It is told in first person by Danny, grown now, in retrospect. He isn't the most interesting character by far, but Patchett created other strong characters in contrast to his bland personality. He jumps around several decades, sharing memories of their misfortune and how it has impacted his and Maeve's lives. I found it to be a really interesting story. Some parts are annoying in the way these siblings refuse to move on. The fact that, 40 years later, they are still allowing this situation affect their life decisions seemed ridiculous and a bit childish. But, overall, I was captivated by their story and hated to see it end.To get an even better experience, I recommend listening to the audiobook. It's narrated by Tom Hanks, who did a fantastic job bringing some much-needed color to Danny's dialog."
645,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/888138-suzanne,Rating 4 out of 5,"Ann Patchett’s “The Dutch House” is a multilayered modern fairytale addressing fundamental psychological concepts in defining why we are who we are. The storyteller is Danny and chronicles his life from his earliest memories living in “The Dutch House” as a baby in post Second World War Pennsylvania through the the end of the twentieth century.  Cyril Conroy, Danny’s emotionally remote father, is the archetypical post war father pursuing the American dream of success. Elna is his wife, a woman he “rescued” from the convent and a life of chosen poverty. They have two children, Maeve and Danny who are seven years apart. Cyril surprises his wife with the estate sale purchase of the fully furnished magnificent mansion known in town as the Dutch house. Elna is horrified. She cannot live in such opulence, surrounded by servants. She sees herself as an ascetic for reasons never explained. How could this couple be so unaware of each other’s needs? Elna flees to India and a life serving the poor, abandoning both her husband and children when Danny was 3 years old. And from that tragic choice the story begins.  This is a well-written novel that would be a great book club choice. Danny and Maeve struggle with attachment issues throughout their lives. Maeve, like her mother, denies herself love with the seemingly caring owner of the frozen vegetable company ( frozen being a great symbol) for whom she works. Caring for Danny is Maeve’s purpose in life. Danny, like his father, becomes a real estate mogul , rejecting his education as a physician and a life caring for others which is so unlike his mother. Neither seems capable of joy or pleasure, except when they are together in a parked car, furtively stealing a cigarette while looking at the Dutch house from afar and reimagining their childhood.  The last half of the novel is a page turner and full of surprises. This is a well written novel with humor and memorable lines the reader may return to. It benefits from a second read."

Although I never forgot it was Tom Hanks speaking, my suspension of disbelief was spot-on as if Ann Patchett had written this book with Tom Hanks in mind as the narrator, Danny, the younger brother of his loving sister (7 years older than he) Maeve. The story revolves around these 2 siblings and the house...The Dutch House. Now, I love homes - the architecture, intricacies, and history of a home, and I have since I was a young girl. This novel is much more than a story about a house/home, and yet the house and it's place in the story didn't disappoint. It fascinated me, as it was both at the heart of the story and as a sideline since it's really about Danny and Maeve's childhood trauma and how it affects them as they become adults. There are other family members and characters who have very meaningful roles, which Patchett does so well. However, one of the most memorable parts that will stay with me is the focus and love between these two siblings. It's also more than just a family story or a story about this house. Patchett is an artist at creating a world where the reader becomes a part of it, regardless how heartbreaking, unfair, or emotionally fragile. There are step-parenting and abandonment issues, as well as success and premature death(s), and yet the constant is Danny and Maeve's relationship, along with the ebbs and flow of their lives.There were some unexpected twists and turns, and I just kept getting more more drawn into it, which is sometimes rare. Towards the end, all the pieces of this puzzle came together into an ending that I fully appreciated. I never once got bored or needed a break, which says volumes about this beautiful novel at a time where I can stop and get exasperated and want to give up on a book. This novel....I only wanted more and more of it. It has found a place as a new favorite and a gloriously memorable novels."

For anyone unfamiliar with her work, then this is a good place to start.Young siblings Maeve and Danny grow up in relatively impecunious circumstances. One day their father, who has found his way into property development and management, acquires the eponymous Dutch House of the title. It was the creation of the VanHoebeek family (pronounced Van Who-bake) in the early part of the 20th Century and their father has now bought up the whole house lock, stock and barrel and it is full of their possessions. This spontaneous purchase however destabilises the marital relationship and soon Mum has left this new family home, leaving Maeve and Danny in the care of their father. What comes next forms the crux of the story.This is very much a story of two people growing into adulthood, forging their way, forming relationships and dealing with childhood events and experiences. It is also about memory and how we can layer our own interpretation over the actual facts and come to regard personal history in a very different light. People do this in order to survive emotionally and they become adept at reframing traumatic happenings in order to ward off depression and overwhelming feelings.This is a beautifully written and mesmerising novel that feels like an American family epic. Highly recommended.The edition that we read is a Waterstones special edition and is beautifully executed. It has Delft sprayed edges and at the back the author talks about how she worked to produce the cover and obtained the image of the young woman, a perfect illustration of how she saw Maeve at one stage of her life, immortalised in the house in a painting."

But everything falls apart with his death, their Stepmother makes her motives apparent, bringing in turbulence in everyone's life.Their growing up years and adult life marks a strange affair with their old home.:The layered storyline oozes with love, care, familial bonds, sacrifices, longing,losses and forgiveness.The lucid prose alongwith the engaging narration gripped my attention till the end.The majestic presence of The Dutch House can be felt throughout the story, the emotions interwind with the inanimate objects and corners echoes loud through the mind. As we delve deeper into the lives of siblings, we are gripped by throes of pain and hurt that left an incurable wound in their lives and affected many others in the course.I couldn't help falling in love with Maeve, the accomodating, patient and caring elder sister and Danny an equally loving, sensitive and protective brother.Their relation with Sandy, Joecyln and fluffy shows few bonds are stronger than blood.The climax left me speechless as if life comes full circle through decades of agony and longing.Redemption is many a times found in most unlikely places.:The multi-generational family saga made my heart heavy, words will always fail to describe the way it made me feel.A must read for the lovers of fiction and family dramas."

I am partial to a good family drama and some good ol’ Rich People Problems, but this book takes age-old themes and packages in a way that feels so fresh and colorful.We follow decades of the lives of Danny and his sister Maeve, whose father manages to quietly save money until he can purchase, and move the family into, a luxurious and iconic mansion. He does this as a surprise to his wife, who seems to be wholly unaware of their financial capacity to do this and struggles to unroot herself from the lower-class life she has only ever known, that is deeply entrenched in her identity. She is unable to adapt to - and actually rather disgusted by - the sheer excess of the house and her new servant-laden lifestyle, and abandons her family without a trace to give her life to charity and escape the house. Danny and Maeve grow up motherless until their father remarries a younger woman who is clearly only interested in the status that accompanies living in such a famous property, and the broken relationship causes the facade of their affluent lives to crumble.What I love is what this book doesn’t do: it doesn’t make this a diatribe against the wealthy and the privileged; it doesn’t make this a story about how family is more important than anything else. That’s what makes it so impressive; it’s modern without beating the dead horses that so many other contemporary books feel the need to beat. (It helps that this was a really great escape from my previous read, Very Nice, which is the poster child for overdoing it on the social awareness). I think this is actually my first five-star book of the year.More book chatter over at @ode.to.myshelf on instagram!"

While I will admit it was well-written and engaging for the most part, I can't say it was one of my favorites or something I'd highly recommend. However, if you like this author and the subject matter interests you, it's worth checking out.I was expecting a lot more from this story, based on all the good reviews. I was hoping that Danny and Maeve would have to struggle more after being kicked out of their house. However, it seemed like they just went on with their lives and that was it. They tended to obsess about the house and its current inhabitants a lot though. Ann Patchett does a good job writing about a male coming of age in the twentieth century, although I would have loved chapters from Maeve's perspective too.There were some parts where the story jumped around in time, making it confusing. They also barely mentioned what the year was. I know some parts took place in 1968 and 1971 was mentioned too, but then they just went by age and I had to do the math to see what year it was. It wasn't really clear based on settings and there weren't really any pop culture references either. Overall, it was interesting enough to keep me turning the pages, but some of the characters could be really frustrating. Since there's so much age progression, I didn't have any casting ideas for this one. There's a lot to unpack for a book club discussion and it was a relatively quick read."

Reading one feels like fine dining - I savor every bite and can't wait to read it again. The Dutch House was no different. Patchett weaves a family saga like few authors can. She also does a terrific job of orienting you to Place, and in this case, it's a grand and luxurious home called The Dutch House, formerly owned by The VanHoebeeks and procured by Cyril Conroy. The purchase surprises his wife, but propels him and his family into wealth, while changing the course of their lives forever. Elna Conroy, Danny and Maeve's mother comes to life slowly as a character, somewhat in tandem and opposition with our awareness of the uniqueness of the house. Through their reminiscing in front of the house, sitting in a car and smoking cigarettes, Maeve and Danny recount memories and life choices. Small dips back and forth in time like this might be confusing in the hands of another writer, but Ann Patchett handles it deftly. I love reading a novel that deeply pulls me in. I could see the settings, the characters, the cigarettes hidden in the pockets of hospital scrubs and the tears shed by aging women. I saw it all and wanted to drink it all in, and I often took a moment to pause and reflect at the whole of it. And maybe the highest compliment I can give is that it constantly gave me a desire to reread it soon. Tears were shed and in the end, there was no question this is a 5 star read for me. Well done! "

I read it as part of my classic book BINGO challenge I'm doing this year and will use this for the G5 Book from another book club or library list square.

Tarinaa kertoo Conroyn perheen poika Danny, jolle Santeri Kinnunen antaa innostuneen äänen. Isä Conroy hankki perheelleen toisen maailmansodan jälkeen ylellisen talon, jota aiemmin asutti hollantilainen VanHoebeekin perhe. Kauppaan kuului kaikki: irtaimisto, sukupotretit ja astiastot, mutta köyhistä oloista kotoisin oleva äiti Elna ei pystynytkään elämään kaiken tämän rikkauden keskellä, vaan lähti pois. Hän jätti Dannyn ja tyttärensä Maeven apulaisten hoiviin ja hävisi lastensa elämästä vuosikymmeniksi. Isän kuoltua talo siirtyi äitipuolen omistukseen ja sisarukset joutuivat jättämään ylellisen kotinsa. Taloon jäi myös pienestä lettipäisestä Maevesta maalattu muotokuva, joka koristaa kirjan kantta. Vuosikymmenien ajan Maeve ja Danny istuvat autossa entistä kotia vastapäätä tarkkailemassa taloa. He näkevät joskus ehkä äitipuolensakin, mutta eivät koskaan uskalla soittaa ovikelloa. Romaani on kiehtova elämänkudelma, joka kertoo sisarusten elämästä pitkälle keski-ikään. Menetyksistään he eivät katkeroidu, vaan välittävät toisistaan kovasti. Tarinan imuun oli ihanaa upota. Myöhempikin elämä toi Dannylle ja Maevelle pettymyksiä, mutta myös onnellisia jälleennäkemisiä. Nuorena Maeve oli sanonut ahneelle äitipuolelleen Andrealle, että tämä jäisi yksin. Toteutuiko ennustus, selviää kirjasta. Hollantilainen talo on nostalginen ja hieno sukutarina, jossa on kosolti lämpöä ja hurmaavuutta."

As many others have said, the pacing is definitely slow, and this is in no way an action book. It's entirely about deeply knowing just a few characters, and I'm definitely here for that. That said, I'm thankful I listened to it on audiobook rather than reading it as I have a feeling the slow pacing may have left me reluctant to keep picking it up. I saw a couple reviews bemoaning the fact that nothing really happens in this book, and that's definitely not true: real life happens, and as with most of us, it's a subtle unfolding of days following days rather than a crash and bang. As for the audio narration, I have mixed feelings. Obviously, listening to Tom Hanks read this is a joy. What is it about his voice that's so oddly soothing? While I appreciated having his voice draw me into the story, though, my familiarity with him also made his role as narrator somewhat jarring. Am I the only one who pictured Forrest Gump from time to time? I think the problem for me was that I have such a strong image in my head for Tom Hanks, and it wasn't the same image I would have naturally given Danny. Still, it's a fantastic story of a life gone sideways, and it goes on the list of books I'd recommend for those who love character studies."

Danny tells the story — full of recognition of his then-obliviousness — of himself, his older sister Maeve, and their sometimes senseless path through life. Much of the story centers around the Dutch House — the outrageously lavish estate purchased by their newly-minted real estate mogul father at the end of WWII) — which purchase begins the unraveling of their family.I’m a big Ann Patchett fan — her insight into character and how it is expressed and molded by events and situations is incomparable. While sometimes frustrating in the cluelessness of characters (as seen from our safe reader’s perch) and lack of closure, the story is ultimately a realistic portrayal of the way lives and relationships evolve and what we do and don’t learn from the path. It’s one of those books that gets better the more you think about it after reading, although to be honest it is not one of my favorite Patchetts.Thank you to Harper Collins Publishers and NetGalley for providing an advance copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.

Nobody was really able to overcome childhood trauma, while that may be true I think we all prefer to hope that we actually can live on to be happy or at least content.Spanning a period of forty years in the lives of Danny Conroy, the narrator, and his sister, Maeve, The Dutch House by Ann Patchett unfolds memoir-style, in a fluid timeline, moving back and forth in time to propel this family drama relentlessly forward. The result is an addictive, unflinching look at the making and unmaking of a marriage—or several in this case— and the repercussions for the younger generation left to pick up the pieces.I was entranced by the depth of the story and character development. I liked the ‘Dutch house’ and had no trouble visualizing how that ostentatious house loomed large in the consciousness of the Conroy children and their stepsisters. I loved both Danny and Maeve; they were dealt a tough hand of cards and had to learn to live accordingly. I had no sympathy for the abandoning mother and the evil stepmother, but their dynamics with the younger generation made for one heck of a novel."

But his wife is not pleased and eventually she leaves the family. Danny and his older sister Maeve cling to one another, especially after their father remarries. I love Patchett’s writing. I love the way she reveals her characters in what they say and do. We see Danny grow from a young child to a middle-aged man with children of his own. And we watch Maeve take on the mantle of responsibility for her younger brother, encouraging and pushing him to succeed, to prove that they can thrive without the legacy they expected. We watch as their relationship stalls and eventually grows. And we watch as the next generation of Conroys begin to repeat some of those same patterns.

670,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40394023-betty,Rating 4 out of 5,This is a story that is combination of Cinderella and Handel and Gretel. There is a mansion that some love and others dislike. The mansion brought happy and sadness to their lives. The relationship between Danny & Maeve Conroy is of a very close sibling unconditional love. Even when they don't like the people each other chooses to be with they do not allow to get in between their love for each other. They sit in front of this house in their car seems weird but its their way of dealing with everything. The end was my favorite part of the book. It definitely had me reading fast so I could see how it would end.

Andrea is heartless. She is as nasty and devious as The Wicked Witch in The Wizard of Oz. Ann Patchett weaves an intricate, mysterious tale about a beautiful old house and the role it plays in the lives of Danny and Maeve. Danny is endearing. His loyalty to his sister is touching. I found myself rooting for their success. I couldn't put the book down and the haunting story stays with me. "

To my disappointment, I found that there was no such house. I stumbled upon an interview with the author who explained that she intentionally chose not to depict a house for the cover or name an inspiration. The idea is that we all have a Dutch house. She’s right- when I thought back, I realized I had been picturing my grandparents’ house the entire time I read the book. I wouldn’t read this book if you’re looking for a suspenseful plot, but I enjoyed it for what it was-a rumination on memory, nostalgia, and growing up."

This is everything that I love in a book: a complex family dynamic, a house that is as much a character as a person, a narrative timeline that moves between years in a non-linear form, nothing happens and everything happens all at the same time, emotional without being overly sentimental, perfect writing.

This is Ann Patchett’s finest work of literature. It has a bit of a lull midway through, but that is its only flaw. I did not love all of the characters, but they’re essential to the narrative. All of that being said, it is a marvelously rich story of a brother and a sister, and their complicated relationship, and complications from an extended family, and, yes, a house.

The house, of course, is only the brick and mortar that binds the love of this dysfunctional family. Such wonderful characters.

714,no user info,Rating 1 out of 5,"I've read mostly glowing things about Ann Patchett's writing and her talent for portraying families, but had never read her work before. This was a finalist for the Pulitzer, so I figured I better board the train. I can't speak to how this fits into her other work, only how I feel about it as an individual entity. And I found very little to appreciate. There was nothing challenging about this book. I don't mean there was nothing challenging occurring within the book - we are told over and over again how challenging it was for the first person narrator, Danny, and his sister Maeve to have a mother who abandoned them, a distant father, and an evil stepmother. But therein lies the problem - we are TOLD. Everything is a reminiscence, and I found the overall back and forth, back and forth structure of Danny's reminiscences to be frustrating. It reflects the unreliability of memory itself, yes, but his memories were never that...engaging. He doesn't reveal anything deep or poignant enough about his memories, or the emotions attached to them when they happened or when they're being told, to draw you in. So I was not convinced he had anything deep or poignant to say about them at all. Much information was repeated at different points in time, usually without any new insights gleaned the second time around. This all adds up to a retelling that felt not just aimless but purposeless.This book did not engage me as a reader, period. It did not ask me to think about anything, ask hard questions, or do any work. I was merely told how it was for Danny, and how miserable and bitter he and Maeve were. The only thing I really found myself pondering was the position mothers are put in when they feel suffocated and trapped - is it right to leave your children so you can feel alive and be a person again? I was curious how their mother's reentry into their lives would shake up and challenge the narrative with exactly that question. By the time it happened, however, it had been so long coming and so predictable that I didn't care either way. There was nothing challenging about the way it happened, or about how Danny and Maeve reacted to it. There was a flash of drama and tension in how it shook up Danny and Maeve's relationship, but it all happened in the space of a single insular conversation and then bled right into the background of Danny's detached morosity on the subject. It happens much the same with Danny and Maeve's reunion with their evil stepmother at the end, who is both humanized and dehumanized in such a way that robs the moment (and the laborious lead up to the moment) of anything remotely challenging or dramatic.The time period(s) this book were set in could have added something magical to it (this book has been described as a ""fairy tale"" for some reason, but there is not much magic in it for me). There are scant mentions of racial and income inequality, the Vietnam war...that's literally all I can think of in terms of historical or cultural markers. And they all happen outside of the narrative, as if the narrative itself takes place in a bubble universe of its own, as if the many decades and events of the entire 2nd half of the 20th century that pass by have no bearing on it. Perhaps that is what makes this seem like a fairy tale to others, but I found it a loss rather than a boon.Many readers have expressed their feeling that the Dutch House itself was a character, but it did not feel alive to me. I did not feel the grandeur of it when Danny reminisced about his childhood there, or the suffocation when their stepmother took it over, or the loss of it when they left. I was told many times there were intricate bannisters and beautiful chandeliers and a ballroom on the third floor and many many stairs. Still, I couldn't picture it in my head. What I could picture and what did feel alive were the paintings in the house - of the old VanHoebeeks who owned the house previously, and of Maeve as a child - because of how those portraits weighed on the inhabitants of the house. The paintings oftentimes felt more alive to me than the living characters, and that's because we see everything and everyone through Danny's dull, clueless lens. Not even Tom Hanks' audio narration was enough to liven it. It was mildly compelling when he was a child, waking up to the injustices in his world. But for the most part, Danny is a passenger in his own life, letting Maeve or his wife steer him around, and perhaps there's something to be said for a male character in that position when so often it is a female. But he as a human was so ineffectual and uninteresting that I found him consistently grating and hard to sympathize with.To put forth a little spoiler as an example: We learn at the end that Danny did the exact same thing to his wife that his father did to his mother - as a grand romantic gesture, he bought a building that was to be their home without consulting her, assuming she would love it because of its magnificence. And as it happens, both wives hate their homes. Danny fails to make any connection between his own actions and his father's, despite the fact that that was a major reason why their mother ended up leaving. Danny has not bothered to learn anything throughout this whole ordeal, so why should I have bothered to go through it with him? It makes the rare times Danny does realize how clueless he's been about his life seem pointless and impotent.The character of the stepmother, Andrea, was another issue for me. She was an easy villain. Evil for no reason, or that's how Danny and Maeve saw it, and the only way the reader could see it. Danny and Maeve's whole adult lives orbited around the fact that Andrea was so horrible to them as children/adolescents, to the point that they become the villains in their own story out of bitterness and spite. Such a progression could have been a powerful exploration of human nature, and if that was Patchett's intention, it was lost on me through the shallow mess of Danny's narration. For that reason I also didn't find the writing itself to be all that fresh or sparkling. There was very little drama to it, at the micro sentence level and the macro story level. Danny's sentences were flat, monotonous, unsophisticated, as was his overall narration. I don't need a dramatic plot or even dramatic characters, but I do need drama (conflict and tension). This was misery for misery's sake, and the misery was repeated ad nauseam: Maeve and Danny sitting in the car outside the Dutch House talking about how terrible Andrea was; Maeve's diabetes; draining the education trust to spite Andrea; their father's bad knee; Maeve's diabetes; Maeve and Danny in the car outside the Dutch House; Danny hating medical school; how terrible Andrea was; Maeve's diabetes; their father's bad knee; Danny hating medical school; Maeve and Danny in the car outside the Dutch House; Danny wanting to own real estate like his father; Maeve's diabetes; Maeve and Danny in the car outside the Dutch House; real estate; the education trust; how terrible Andrea was; their father's bad knee; Maeve's diabetes; real estate; Maeve and Danny in the car outside the Dutch House; Maeve's diabetes; more cars, everyone in cars talking about how miserable they are all the time.Overall I found this book tedious, detached and uninspiring, in large part because of Patchett's choice to write it from Danny's first person POV. I did not enjoy or appreciate the experience, and it did not leave me with anything significant to think about. No lingering questions about life or family or relationships or forgiveness. I'm truly sorry to say I don't know how this ended up a finalist for the Pulitzer. It did not feel urgent or profound enough to warrant the praise it has received."

It was all over bookstagram and people shouting about how it has this gorgeous cover and is this beautiful story about a house and a family and blah blah blah. I just COULDN’T CARE LESS! Hot take: I didn’t think the cover was gorgeous like everyone else, and who gives a SHIT about this giant house and the assholes living in it?Cut to Thanksgiving weekend and my friend telling me that Tom Hanks does the narration for the audiobook, and I immediately added myself to the library queue for it. #anythingfortomhanksI’ve bemoaned in the past that I am not a good audiobook listener, but 🎉🎉🎉 I am here to tell you I AM CHANGED! I GET IT NOW! I am IMPROVING! This is GROWTH! This book was a gorgeous listen. I adored this bildungsroman. I was enraptured the whole time—Tom Hanks helped in this, but truly, it’s the writing. This lyrical telling of two siblings growing up and evolving, all revolving around this grandiose and magnetic house was just what I didn’t know I needed or wanted. I cannot tell you how many times I found myself letting out soft and surprised chuckles or audible exhalations, both of the pleased and upset variations. I lingered in my car, in the shower, and getting ready to go out just to get a few more moments with this book. Patchett’s ability to create this loving, funny, and frustrating sibling relationship felt so natural and made me deeply miss my brother and sister. I get the Patchett love now. I saw  Commonwealth at the library sale and immediately snatched it up. If you, too, were like me and just DGAF about this book: put your pride away. Let Tom Hanks’ voice and Patchett’s words take you on a journey of love, anger, and forgiveness. One of my favorite things about this book was listening to T.Hanx announce the chapter titles. What a splendid gift to us all. Sometimes, he announced it with petulant impatience; others like a joyful secret to be revealed; sometimes with the graveness that leads to a moment of silence. You never knew what you’d get, and I waited with bated breath for each one. I legit made my colleagues listen to three of them during lunch one day. If you don’t love it, then you’re missing out on some joy. A dog does bark! 🐶🔊 A dog named Lumpy excitedly barks in chapter 16. "
716,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75779839-charles-edwards-freshwater,Rating 3 out of 5,"Patchett's Dutch House is a family saga, warped fairytale and interesting exploration into themes such as identity, parenthood and the power that the past has over the present.This was June's choice for book club, and one of those novels that is pretty rare - I actually liked it slightly less after discussing it with others and becoming more aware of some of its flaws.But, we'll start with the positives:The writing is sumptuous and evocative - the titular house especially is gorgeously described and this lends an almost gothic feel to the tale. It's one of those houses that is definitely a character itself a la Manderley in Du Maurier's Rebecca, and the perfect setting despite much of the action taking place elsewhere.The two main characters are both well-rounded and felt very real - Maeve, in particular, was incredibly lifelike and very believable throughout.I liked the narrative structure despite it being slightly confusing here and there - dipping in and out of different time periods and points of their lives gave the narrative a pleasing fluidity and added to the overall cyclical nature of the novel.Some of the secondary characters are brilliant too, Fluffy, the much maligned nurse maid and Celeste the long-suffering wife were expertly portrayed.The negatives:If I hadn't known that Ann Patchett had wanted a fairytale feel to this novel, the characters of the father, mother and stepmother would've felt very flat and not rounded at all. I still think they were a bit too two dimensional, and this is repeated in some ways by the later generations who echo the same choices as the people that came before them. It's a bit on the nose and not particularly subtle.Although the story is pleasing in its structure, there are contrivances to make it work so well, and some characters perform actions that are not very in keeping with their characterisation in order to make the plot work. (e.g - if the father was so money minded and good at accounts etc. why would he leave only an educational provision for the children but refuse to write a will? It's explained that he feels too young to make a will, but with Andrea being militant and effectively signing up for co-ownership on everything, it's hard to believe he wouldn't have been savvy enough to provide for his children, especially as he has no great affection for the stepmother anyway.) Another example is the daughter becoming a famous movie star in order to buy the house at the end - fine...but also it's just sort of done to end the novel with a sort of homecoming for Maeve and it felt a bit false and silly even though I enjoyed it.I also struggled with Danny's narration in parts and didn't necessarily believe in him as a male character - I think Patchett is much more skilled at writing women (Danny is perhaps the only real male character in this story who isn't built entirely from memories) and something about him didn't ring true at certain parts.I found the novel strangely hard to get into - for the first 120 or so pages I didn't care at all, and although this definitely changed by the end (I still really enjoyed this book) I wasn't desperate to continue reading and I could quite happily put it down between chapters.Its a good story, but one that is perhaps a little too calculated to be truly satisfying. Luckily, the gorgeous writing and interesting characters help to patch this flaw over, but not enough for this to be a new favourite.3.75 stars"
717,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/130584594-emily-strom,Rating 5 out of 5,"huzzah! a modern work of fiction that I actually enjoyed! big shoutout to anna for this recommendation (and to clare for corroborating her)I had to start reading this book in pdf version on my phone (because I was dumb enough to only bring one book for a 15 hour car drive), but once I got a physical copy from the library, I accelerated to the finish. While this story is obviously about a house, it is more specifically about the role the house plays in the disintegration of the Conroy family. Sometimes stories about family dysfunction are simply depressing because you get a close-up look at how already broken human beings can become either twisted or crushed by their misfortunes, but this wasn't that. Maeve, particularly when Danny was growing up, was almost unbelievably good, putting his needs first to try to fill a hole in his life. And I loved the Maeve/Danny dynamic - without that, this story would have only been a shadow of what it is. I also enjoyed following them from childhood to middle-aged adulthood because it really helped you understand why they were the way they were and to see how they changed.It's hard to say much more without spoiling anything, but I was fascinated by the parallelism between Danny and his father and the retrospective tapestry of narration combining past and present.""But we overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we're not seeing it as the people we were, we're seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.”“We had made a fetish out of our misfortune, fallen in love with it. I was sickened to realize we’d kept it going for so long, not that we had decided to stop.”“The dinner was a huge production, with kids stashed in the den to eat off card tables like a collection of understudies who dreamed of one day breaking into the dining room.” (incredibly relatable description of family holidays!)"

For a good portion of this book I was like ugh this guy is one sexist fuck, the author must be a mysogynist. Then I realized it was a woman writer and she was just accurately depicting the way men and boys are raised and live in this world then I liked it better lol. The whole time he was just in his own world, only really focusing on his dad and sister and even then he was one self absorbed fuck. I definitely didn’t like him as a person but the story was good enough that it was ok. His relationships are also weird, but I like how they developed. The whole book was kind of sad but in a numbing way, the kind that just sits in the background the whole time, kind of like a lull as you read. Like there was never a point that I was heartbreakingly sad, even when really sad stuff happened. The ending was so beautiful though. Also tom hanks narrated it and his clout definitely got him points because he narrated it the way he wanted to. Definitely broke some rules but I liked it. It was a good comforting book in a weird way, but I don’t know why it was a Pulitzer finalist that’s for sure. Some reviews said they didn’t like the jumping around timeline, but I surprisingly liked it. Especially since I usually have a hard time with stories like that but I felt like it was done really beautifully here. The story covered a lot of complex characters and their complex relationships which I think is the best part of this book. It is unfortunate that we had to hear about it all from a main character is so fucking dense and lacks any kind of empathy. Love the cover, especially once I realized what it was."

Het is zijn droom om hier een gelukkig gezinsleven op te bouwen, maar zijn vrouw kan er niet aarden en verdwijnt, eerst voor korte periodes, later voorgoed, Cyril achterlatend met hun kinderen Danny en Maeve. Al snel komt stiefmoeder Andrea in hun leven, maar zij kan de kinderen niet uitstaan en zet Danny en Maeve uiteindelijk, vlak na het overlijden van Cyril, uit het huis, waardoor ze op elkaar zijn aangewezen.De verteller van het verhaal is zoon Danny, en Ann Patchett krijgt het voor elkaar om binnen een paar hoofdstukken zulke volledige, complexe, levendige personages te schetsen, dat je al snel het gevoel hebt dat je ze kent en kunt inschatten welke keuzes ze zullen maken en welke motieven daarachter schuilgaan. Toch spelt ze niet alles voor je uit en is er ook ruimte voor eigen interpretatie, wat ik erg sterk vond, omdat juist dat wat niet gezegd wordt vaak de meeste indruk maakt. Danny was nog erg jong toen bepaalde gebeurtenissen plaatsvonden, waardoor hij ook op zijn zus Maeve en personeelsleden vertrouwt om herinneringen aan hun tijd in het Hollandse Huis in te kleuren, waardoor je een vollediger beeld krijgt. Het huis speelt zo’n grote rol dat het een personage op zich wordt.Grote thema’s als (emotionele) verwaarlozing, wrok, uitsluiting, eenzaamheid, verwerking van het verleden, het herhalen van patronen uit je jeugd en hoe een ongelukkige jeugd doorwerkt in de rest van je leven komen ter sprake, maar nergens voelt het boek te zwaar. De intense band tussen broer en zus springt overal bovenuit, ook al maakt die band het voor beiden soms lastig om diepe relaties met anderen aan te gaan. Ann Patchett heeft een prachtig verhaal geschreven over een (gebroken) familie en door haar mooie, sprankelende schrijfstijl heb ik het boek verslonden. ‘Het Hollandse huis’ was het eerste boek dat ik van haar heb gelezen, maar het zal zeker niet mijn laatste zijn.4.5⭐️"

721,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7677778-udisha-saklani,Rating 5 out of 5,"I have tried reading Ann Patchett's work before but could somehow never get all the way till the end. I kept coming across fantastic reviews of The Dutch House, which I always took note of, albeit with considerable caution. I stumbled upon a paperback version of the book in my neighbourhood library, and thought - why not? Three days later, I have been left hugely surprised and considerably moved by this understated and engrossing novel. For a reader, it had so much to offer. I was completely drawn into the world of Maeve and Danny, their bond as brother and sister, their (unhealthy) obsession with their past, the indeterminate and imposing effect of their childhood home on their present lives, the multilayered portrayal of the Conroys family, and the constant twisting back and forth between five decades as characters evolve and mature. There is a moment in the book when realisation finally dawns on the two siblings that they had been trapped their whole lives by their childhood trauma and narratives. It was a sober reflection on the stories that we tell ourselves all the time and how they end up shaping our life. For me, this is a thoughtful, poignant story that has been told elegantly, with much richness, depth and texture."

Maar toen ik de omschrijving van dit boek las voor de #ikleesmee leesclub, werd mijn interesse geprikkeld. Ik heb erg van dit boek genoten. Ik vind het erg goed en fijn geschreven, het sleept je helemaal mee in het leven van Danny. Ik denk dat ik liever vanuit Maeve dan vanuit Danny had gelezen, omdat ik haar een interessanter personage vindt.In deel drie raakte ik de sfeer uit het boek kwijt. Het ging meer aanvoelen als een opsomming van gebeurtenissen dan de het persoonlijke verhaal uit de eerste twee delen. Ook voelde het voor mij een beetje alsof er sneller werd beschreven dan in de eerste delen, en die snelheid vond ik minder passen bij het geheel, en vond ik ook minder fijn lezen. Afgezien van wat er dan allemaal gebeurde.. Het riep wel meer emoties op, maar toch vond ik het minder sterk dan de eerste twee delen.Ik heb echt wel genoten van de eerste 3/4 van het boek. Maar ik denk toch niet dat het een boek en verhaal is dat me heel lang goed bij zal blijven. Ik vind het gewoon goed en fijn. Ik twijfel tussen 3 en 4*, maar ik rond toch af naar 3* denk ik omdat de afwikkeling me zo tegenviel. "

I so disliked her Commonwealth that it put me off reading her latest novel till now. After many glowing reviews I decided to approached The Dutch House with some apprehension, no-one likes to criticise a book enjoyed by so many friends. Happy to say that I share the enthusiasm for this book, I too loved this beautifully written story of this big mansion and the complex relationships of the blended family that lived in it. For me this novel was one of Patchett’s best, up there with Bel Canto. I would highly recommend the audio by Tom Hanks that does a stellar job with the narration."

There is a seven (or eight?) year age difference between them, but they become very close, especially after their father remarries Andrea and Andrea and her two daughters move in. Danny is still only 15-years old when their father dies. The story is told from Danny’s point of view and goes back and forth in time between them as adults and growing up.Wow, Andrea is the modern-day evil stepmother from hell, isn’t she!? Like many others, I listened to the audio, which was done so well by Tom Hanks (I’m upping my rating by ¼ star due to his narration). I never lost interest, though it is a slow moving book. I didn’t much like the interaction between Celeste (Danny’s wife) and Maeve, either. I identified more with Danny’s feelings near the end than Maeve’s though I can sort of understand why she would feel the way she did.

A simple book at the surface that felt so easy to ready, but I'm left here with lots of thoughts swirling inside my head about family and life. One of the smartest things Ann Patchett does is to uncomplicate a very complex family structure by giving us a pretty unreliable, detached, uncomplicated narrator. The fact that she chose the son to be our window into this world rather than one of the complicated and powerful women in his life was an interesting choice but I think it works. She left me wanting more but let me, as the reader, fill in alot of the blank spaces on my own. A beautiful read. "

What it is, is family dysfunction at its best. If that’s your thing, then be sure to check this one out. Danny and Maeve are 2 siblings at the heart of this story that spans from the end of the Second World War, through the 90’s. You follow them as children through adulthood. These 2 go through a lot, and you definitely feel for them, even if you don’t always like them. Its so beautifully written that at times you laugh along with them, have your heart broken with them, and so on. Bottom line, The Dutch House is one of those types of books you just should go read for yourself to understand why everyone is enjoying it so much."

By and large it works thanks to the subtlety of the relationship between the narrator, Danny, and his sister Maeve. Danny is a low-key narrator and, therefore, even the more dramatic events are not dwelt upon or overlaid with an excess of emotion. As the title suggests, the house is important, almost becoming an additional character. The weakness, for me, was Danny and Maeve’s parents whose motivations are explained but not fully convincing."

Everything else I read by her I start fearful it won't live up to my expectations. The Dutch House did not let me down however.As always, her characters are so interesting and real. At least the one's she explores. In this, Andrea stays very much the one dimensional evil step mother, but even that feels deliberate - this is not her story, it's Danny and Maeve's. It's the story of a house that holds them enthralled, a house that made their mother disappear and their father unable to understand why. In the end, the house is a character in of itself.Danny is so implacable. He's happy to go with the flow, do what he is told until he's not. He does what he needs to do to make others happy until it doesn't suit until he wants to do what makes him happy. Even then he's OK with biding his time. As for Maeve, I don't think I could have been as forgiving as she was.Patchett is a master of the family saga that is slightly left of centre. This book is a great exploration of family relationships, what makes them, what breaks them and the ties that bind, even when we wish they didn't."

At first I was really into the story, learning about Maeve and Danny's childhood, why their mother left them and most interesting part for me was the history and details of the Dutch house. But by the end of it I got a little bit bored to be honest and it was hard to get to the ending, so that's why I gave it 4 starts.

Not one I liked or didn’t like...they were just human. The story was okay for me. Interesting to see what played out and the choices made. No major trauma drama just regular family dysfunction ha ha. Getting there can be a bit long but the lessons learned throughout the book are the real gem. Forgiveness, loyalty, family & everyday life decisions and their consequences. I did love the sibling relationship between Danny and Maeve. That is something I personally relate to. Driving by your childhood home where so much life happened I also relate to. Not in a sad way like in the book but a nostalgic way for sure. I read some but listened to the rest and that was the way to go. Slow going to read plus you get the magnificent Tom Hanks to narrate for you and that is a voice I love.I want to see the Dutch house in real life!"

She somehow writes intimately about grief and family while also making the story feel epic. I ended up liking the narrative structure even though the jumping around confused me at first. Side note and probably TMI but - I feel like Maeve and Danny are my little sister and brother in an alternate, twisted universe if not because my sister has thick black hair and my brother looks exactly like my late father then maybe because we grew up in a Dutch colonial? But in all seriousness an important lesson about grief and the balance between processing and becoming encompassed by it."

Their tumultuous fluctuations, fizzing out, etc. What she has problem with I think is bringing it all together. Glad I finished it.—————— Sorry, but no.I was not invested in this book. It felt like I was hearing a distant tale from someone about a family, rather than actually getting a glance into the heads of the people involved. Maybe I got the timing wrong? I don't think so.

768,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14371463-suzanne-arcand,Rating 4 out of 5,"I have not enjoyed a book as much as this one in a long while. I hardly have anything to say against it except maybe: “Why did the author have to kill Maeve?” I even loved the cover portrait, which was commissioned by the novelist herself and painted by the portraitist Noah Saterstrom. Patchett learned about him from the author Donna Tart. It corresponds so well to the description of Maeve: “… Maeve now stood like a soldier in the queen’s court, or like the queen herself. Even I could see how she might have been intimidating: her height, the shining black wall of hair, the way she would lower her eyes to look at a person rather than bend her neck. “ To go back to Maeve, she’s the whole story for me. Much more interesting than her brother Danny, the narrator. A strong, kind woman. She plays the role of the mother for Danny, since she raised him from age four. She dedicates her life to him, without ever giving the impression that she is making a sacrifice. She’s always protective of her little brother. When Fiona hits him, “ … she flew across the kitchen the way the deer would fly across the hedgerow”. Danny recognizes this fact when he says: “Mothers were the measure of safety, which meant that I was safer than Maeve. … Maeve took up the job on my behalf but no one did the same for her.” Maeve is good to everybody. When their father remarries, she takes care of Norma and Bright the daughter of their evil stepmother. She even tries to make Norma feel better when Norma is moved to Maeve’s room and Maeve has to move to the attic. She’s bright. She has a sense of humor. When Danny tells her that he’s studying pulmonology, she answers, “The study of trains?”The parents are hard to understand. They both neglect their children, each in their own way. From the start they’re oblivious to their children’s needs. For example, right after describing how the incompetent Fluffy (Fiona) neglected the house comes this sentence: “My parents had hired Fluffy to be my sister’s nanny.” Danny ends up having a lot in common with his father. Not only is he also in real estate, but he is somewhat neglectful of his wife and daughters.All the characters in the book are complex people. Except maybe for the mother, whom we never really get to know. She remains a mystery. Even Andrea, who is the villain of the story, I can understand somewhat, but not the mother. She wants to be a saint, but doesn’t show much compassion for her own children. It seems that she is motivated more by her own ego. I don’t understand the father either, when I think of it. How can he disown his children? Even the domestic aids are well-rounded character. Fiona turns out not to be a simple character as Danny, the narrator, founds out. The descriptions are marvelous, particularly those of the house. The scenes are vivid with color and sounds: “ … the pea gravel crunching beneath our Sunday shoes…”The structure, that goes back and forth in time, is fairly complex but the narrative remains limpid. The book is a lot about the situation of women at the time. Danny and Maeve’s mother is dependent on her husband. Until she leaves him, she had no say in where or how they lived. Same with Andrea, who marries for money and Celeste who wants to marry Danny in large part because she thinks that he will become a doctor. The only truly independent woman is Maeve."
769,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59814215-carolyn,Rating 4 out of 5,"I listened to the audiobook narrated by Tom Hanks and I think that his reading really added a quality to the story that I wouldn’t have been able to conjure myself. The expression he gave Danny, the narrator of the story, was excellent. Patchett’s writing is quite unique in its subtlety and character observations and Danny felt like quite a flawed, emotionally tone-deaf person. Hanks gave Danny’s voice just the right kind of tenor and nuance that I could see where he was coming from. I wouldn’t say I loved the story but it gets four stars from me as an audio. "

775,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75898435-marcin,Rating 1 out of 5,"Postmodernistyczny miks bajki o Jasiu i Małgosi, przypowieści o dobrym samarytaninie oraz o synu marnotrawnym oraz wątków złej macochy, dobrej wróżki oraz utraconego pałacu w naprawdę złym wykonaniu!Ta powieść to kolejny doskonały przykład petryfikowania literatury przez dyletantów, imających się pióra z braku lepszego pomysłu na zarabianie hajsu i tłuczących kolejne bestsellery według oklepanego, ogranego schematu wypracowanego przez orędowników kursów kreatywnego pisania. Wyrób prozatorskopodobny Ann Patchett jest bardzo readable, w końcu przeczytałem go w trzy dni. Napisany przystępnym językiem, bez fajerwerków, strony same się przewracają, więc to pozycja idealna dla tych, którzy marzą o niezobowiązującej lekturze i chcą poćwiczyć lub podtrzymać kontakt z angielszczyzną. Naczelny warunek powieści napisanej pod linijkę według dekalogu kursów kreatywnego pisania, owe wspomniane bycie readable prozatorski potworek amerykańskiej autorki spełnia z naddatkiem. Niestety drugi warunek, mianowicie credibility zawiódł na całej linii. Dlaczego? Już wyjaśniam.Tytułowy Dom Holendrów to posiadłość wraz z okazałym domem wybudowana przez pochodzących z Holandii potentatów przemysłu tytoniowego, w którym po zakończeniu II wojny światowej zamieszkuje narrator powieści wraz ze swoją rodziną. Jeśli spodziewaliście się jakieś sielanki rodem z cyklu powieściowego o Annie Shirley albo cukierkowych obrazów rodem z Domku na prerii, to nic bardziej mylnego! Dom Holendrów – mimo że nie posiada żadnych nadprzyrodzonych mocy, a sama Patchett napisała ckliwą obyczajówkę, a nie horror – jest niczym Trzewia Lewiatana: przytłacza swą monstrualną wielkością, onieśmiela bogactwem i historią, tłamsi wrażliwe jednostki, wzbudza nienawiść w matce głównego bohatera. Dlaczego? Z książki się tego nie dowiecie. Sama autorka pewnie nie ma zielonego pojęcia dlaczego, ale Dom Holendrów fajnie się prezentuje w tytule, jest intrygujący, trochę tajemniczy, przyciąga uwagę, więc coś trzeba zakombinować w fabule, aby uzasadniało to obecność tego domu – niczym artefaktu - w tytule, a że pomysł jest kompletnie do dupy jest zupełnie bez znaczenia. Wszyscy bohaterowie powieści wypowiadają się o nim per Dom Holendrów. Nikt, nawet narrator, który w nim się wychował od bobasa, nie mówi o nim „mój dom”, tylko i wyłącznie „Dom Holendrów”. To tak, jakbym kupił mieszkanie w Loftach u Scheiblera, a następnie powiedział siostrze, że zaproszę ją do Loftów u Scheiblera (a nie do mojego mieszkania), jakbym obwieszczał znajomym, że urządzam przyjęcie w Loftach u Scheiblera (a nie po prostu w moim mieszkaniu). Albo gdybym się stamtąd wyprowadził, a następnie przejeżdżając przez miasto poczuł nagłą chęć zobaczenia Loftów u Scheiblera (a nie mojego dawnego mieszkania). Fakt, że przez całą powieść jej bohaterowie o miejscu, w którym mieszkali i się wychowywali mówią „Dom Holendrów”, zamiast po prostu „nasz dom” wali sztucznością na kilometr!!!Matka narratora jest praktykującą katoliczką, której życiowym powołaniem jest pomoc bliźnim, którym się w życiu nie udało. Wstydzi się swego wysokiego statusu materialnego osiągniętego po spektakularnym sukcesie biznesowym męża. Jej poczucie winy i chęć czynienia dobra jest tak silna, że pewnego dnia odchodzi od męża i wyjeżdża do Indii nieść pomoc misjonarską. I ja jako czytelnik mam niby uwierzyć, że gorliwa katoliczka, uczestnicząca w życiu parafii i uczęszczająca co niedzielę w nabożeństwie, porzuca męża, któremu ślubowała w obliczu Boga miłość, wierność, uczciwość małżeńską i że go do śmierci nie opuści, z powodów altruistycznych przekreśla wszystko to, w co wierzyła, aby zostać misjonarką… Mam uwierzyć, że pragnienie niesienia posługi chrześcijańskiej w egzotycznym kraju jest tak silne, że wbrew dogmatom swojej wiary praktykująca katoliczka w latach 50. ubiegłego wieku porzuca dom, męża i dwoje małych dzieci (sic!), bo nie radzi sobie ze swoim wysokim statusem materialnym i wyrzuty sumienia zaganiają ją do Indii, gdzie wreszcie może pomagać biednym, jakby w Stanach Zjednoczonych w tym okresie nie było nikogo potrzebującego pomocy i miłosierdzia…Narrator powieści jest złotym dzieckiem. Mimo że matka porzuca go w wieku lat 4, w ogóle nie docieka przyczyny takiego stanu rzeczy. Jego wiek wręcz predestynuje go do zadawania kłopotliwych pytań w najmniej sprzyjających ku temu okolicznościach – w końcu czteroletnie dziecko nie ma jeszcze wyrobionego poczucia przyzwoitości, nie wie, co wypada a co nie, które pytanie może okazać się kłopotliwe i lepiej jest trzymać język za zębami. Narrator w wykonaniu Patchett już w wieku czterech lat doskonale zrozumiał, że nie ma sensu pytać nikogo, zwłaszcza ojca, o to gdzie się podziała mama i kiedy wróci. Przyjmuje po prostu za oczywistość to, że w USA matki po prostu ot tak znikają po pewnym czasie. W okresie dojrzewania również jest potulny jak baranek. Gdy ojciec odwala kitę i zostawia sporo kasy w funduszu powierniczym, narrator pod wpływem swojej starszej siostry idzie do colledge’u i rozpoczyna naukę na kierunku pre-med, choć zupełnie go to nie interesuje. Wszystko dlatego, że medycyna jest jednym z najdroższych kierunków i istnieje spora szansa, że cała kasa z funduszu pójdzie na jego naukę i nic nie zostanie dla pasierbic zmarłego ojca – córek nienawidzonej macochy, która wysiudała narratora i jego siostrę z Domu Holendrów. Narrator więc bez przekonania – ale z rewelacyjnymi stopniami – przechodzi przez colledge, później przez kilka lat studiuje medycynę, następnie zostaje stażystą w szpitalu, by po ukończeniu stażu… rzucić medycynę w cholerę i pójść śladem swego ojca, zostając przedsiębiorcą w branży nieruchomości. I mam uwierzyć jako czytelnik, że chłopak poświęca kilkanaście lat życia na ciężką naukę czegoś, co go zupełnie nie interesuje tylko dlatego, aby siostra wzięła rewanż na złej macosze i rozpoczyna życie zawodowe, dochodząc po stażu do niezłych perspektyw zawodowych i kasy, aby zrezygnować z tego wszystkiego i rzucić się w niepewny biznes w branży handlu nieruchomościami… Brawo, Patchett, brawo!!! Totalnie wiarygodny bohater i totalnie wiarygodna historia!W każdej bajce jest czarny charakter i tak też jest u Patchett. Zła macocha to, jakżeby inaczej, druga żona ojca, która po jego śmierci wyrzuca narratora i jego siostrę z pałacu – mitycznego Domu Holendrów. I mam uwierzyć, że po śmierci majętnego rodzica jego dzieci zostają z niczym tylko dlatego, że za jego życia macocha uzyskała tytuł prawny do nieruchomości… Owszem, rozszerzenie wspólności ustawowej na przedmioty majątkowe nabyte przed ślubem jest dopuszczalne, co nie zmienia tego, że w razie śmierci małżonka, jego udział w tych przedmiotach wchodzi w skład masy spadkowej i podlega dziedziczeniu na zasadach ogólnych. Zupełnie nielogiczne dla mnie jest rozwiązanie fabularne zaprezentowane przez autorkę, jakoby fakt uzyskania przez macochę tytułu prawnego do nieruchomości, przedsiębiorstwa i innych składników majątkowych męża sprawiał, że po jego śmierci z automatu tylko ona staje się właścicielką całego majątku, z pominięciem dzieci z pierwszego związku małżeńskiego. Sytuacja taka nie różniłaby się w niczym od faktycznego wydziedziczenia tych dzieci. Patchett, przed napisaniem takiej głupotki skonsultowałaś się może z prawnikiem? Bo powieściowy pomysł jest z lekka niedorzeczny i - rzekłbym - niekonstytucyjny.Jak w każdej klasycznej powieści napisanej według jakże kreatywnego klucza kursów jeszcze bardziej kreatywnego pisania, jej bohater musi zostać skonfrontowany z demonami przeszłości. W recenzowanej pozycji dochodzi do spotkania bohatera i jego siostry z marnotrawną matką. Mimo że nikt nie wie, gdzie ona jest, co się z nią dzieje i czy w ogóle żyje, gdy siostra głównego bohatera ciężko choruje, nieobecna przez dekady matka wyskakuje nagle jak królik z kapelusza. Okazuje się, że w obliczu poważnego stanu zdrowia dziewczyny była niania odnajduje marnotrawną matkę i zawiadamia ją o wszystkim. Aby tak błyskawicznie kogoś znaleźć, trzeba wiedzieć, gdzie szukać, czyż nie? Ale to drobny szczegół w obliczu tak piramidalnych głupot, jakimi ta książka jest przesiąknięta.Po lekturze nie mam poczucia zmarnowanych trzech dni, lecz towarzyszy mi rozczarowanie, że taka mielizna zdobyła nominację do Pulitzera. A porównywanie tej pisaniny do twórczości F. Scotta Fitzgeralda jest policzkiem dla tego ostatniego. Nie mam też cienia złudzeń, że z uwagi na popularność autorki i zasięg rynku amerykańskiego, takie słabiutkie pozycje, opromienione blaskiem nominacji do poważnych nagród literackich, będą wyznaczać wzór do naśladowania, ścieżkę, za którą podążać będą inni rozmarzeni o sukcesie i laurach. Nie mam wątpliwości, że błyskawicznie ten wyrób prozatorskopodobny zostanie przerobiony na serial. Nie mam też wątpliwości, że poważna, wymagająca amerykańska proza umiera, skoro pod takim szyldem reklamowana i wciskana nam jest słabo dopracowana fabularnie obyczajóweczka, która wywietrzy mi z głowy za parę godzin i zleje się w pamięci z innymi podobnymi czytadełkami, podobnymi do siebie jak dwie krople wody."
776,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597746-laura,Rating 3 out of 5,"Why do Ann Patchett’s novels always feel so empty and lifeless to me? She tells interesting, widely varied stories. But in the end they don’t feel quite human to me. (The exception, the book that keeps me hoping her next novel will work, is State of Wonder.) All the characters move around and notice things and do things, but no one ever seems to learn anything worth learning. It’s an interesting story but just as with Commonwealth, feels like Patchett loves to describe the complexities of wealth but never draws any conclusions. She’s far too easy on her characters, even the ones who do horribly selfish things, and I feel more like Danny than anyone at the end: vaguely annoyed with everyone."

A part of me wishes I would have listened to the audiobook though, seeing as Tom hanks was the voice. But then again, at someParts I imagined his voice.. lol. There were many, many parts of this story I enjoyed. I loved how it was written. I really like books that are “coming of age” or go through many periods of life. This book had it all. I loved the relationship between Danny and Maeve. It was so sweet at times, and the devotion to each other. Amazing. I’d say there were only two things that I didn’t like about it. One was a grown woman calling her mother “mommy” constantly. I think that’s more of a personal thing, but it really annoyed me and made the character feel childish. The other thing was the ending. I thought maybe there could have been more insight and it could have gone into a little more depth. I thought it was a bit short. I would highly recommend this book to anyone. I loved it. I hope this one becomes a movie and they use Tom hanks as the older version of Danny. That’s how I pictured him anyway! Haha. :) "
780,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6845568-lonestarwords-deb-coco,Rating 5 out of 5,"There are certain books I finish and have to let settle for a bit before I review. And then there are books I just don’t feel equipped to review, because I don’t know if I can A. do them justice and B. adequately summarize. The Dutch House falls into all of these categories, so where to begin. This is actually my first Ann Patchett. I became totally enamored with her after hearing her speak at the Dallas Museum of Art this fall. If you EVER have the opportunity to see her - do it! She’s one of the most entertaining and fascinating authors I’ve ever had the pleasure of listening to. So, I decided to begin her books, and The Dutch House had just debuted. And as often is true, her writing is exactly like her speech. Thorough and descriptive, but not flowery. Patchett chooses her words so well, doesn’t gush and gets to the point. Some authors (and I am often drawn to them) are very heavy handed with their prose, and she is not one of them. Her writing feels classic - in the same family as Donna Tartt and Amor Towles. This is a quiet book, about a family and the history of a family home. The deep dive is in the sister and brother relationship between Maeve and Danny, and we follow them from childhood through their adult lives. I can’t remember a book since George Eliot’s Mill on the Floss, that so profoundly examines the complexities of the male/female sibling relationship. This novel also reinforced how much I love a story where the house becomes a character, and Patchett draws this so well too. She explores what home means and how it shapes a family’s history, for good and bad. I adored this book. The writing is as exquisite as fine china, but I don’t think it’s for everyone. It is quiet and slow and if you’re hoping for lots of plot, it probably isn’t your read. But if you’re drawn to unique family sagas (with a bit of a twist ending) and want some of the best writing out there, check this out. I’m already on to my next Patchett."

The Dutch House has nothing much about the Dutch House. I believe the author wanted to spook people out with that title but that's the biggest misleading anyone can ever make. What a melodrama. Little Princess No.02. Mom leaves, dad marries, dad dies, step ma shows claws, failed marriage, mom returns, they move back to the house, sister dies, and a lot of unbelievably boring and dramatic mumbo jumbo in between. Danny is an extremely insecure child in an adult body who just can't let go of what's done and dusted. Maeve is another eccentric character. Dan reminded me of a dog chasing his own tail. Maeve is the super woman and both these fellows are stuck in a bubble. It was just going nowhere.

Unfortunately, the book became progressively disappointing past part 1 -- and I had to force myself to finish it. The writing and dialogue lacked the subtlety and quiet elegance of the first half, and the central characters' interactions with the prodigal mother felt completely shallow and implausible. When a parent reappears into the lives of her children after forty-plus years of absence, it's difficult to imagine a reconciliation unfolding as smoothly as it was depicted. Even if I suspended all disbelief in this resolution, my central issue as a reader is that I was told -- not shown -- that the mother, Elna, is a ""saint"" and was ""too good for the Dutch House"". Readers are not shown any glimpse of her life in India, or her life in service anywhere else. Although this kind of detail is naturally limited by the first person narration of her son, Elna's presumed goodness is never revealed through dialogue with either of her children and therefore, feels implausible. Overall, the dialogue felt trite, the characters, shallow and undeveloped, and the relationships - even between the two siblings -- never deeply mined enough for me to care about any of them.  Finally, there's the ""Dutch House"" itself; it never really emerges as a significant presence with an affecting history; there is no enticing backstory from the previous owners, the Van Hoebeeks, and there is no compelling evidence to show that the house was oppressive enough to drive away a mother who claimed to ""love"" her husband and children. The house is merely an attractive backdrop and convenient excuse for the mother's choice to leave her children.Housekeeping, by Marilynne Robinson, established a much finer and nuanced exploration of setting, a more realistic motive for a mother abandoning her children, and explored the long-term adverse effects upon sibling dynamics. The Hours, by Michael Cunningham, also did a much finer job of depicting the inner turmoil of mothers oppressed by time and situation in the 1950s, as well as the effects upon the children left behind.It may seem unfair to hold a work of popular fiction to the high standard set by these literary masterpieces, but I do think that it's justified for a reader to expect a nuanced and thoughtful treatment of a topic such as parental abandonment, and to expect the same level of quality in the second half of the book that was apparent in the first half."

Everyone's done this: Walked into a room they haven't been in since childhood, and marveled at how small it seems now, compared with how big it seemed in their memory. This effect is the result of the haziness of nostalgia, how nostalgia sort of warps memories, and how much present circumstances influence the way we see the past. Ann Patchett has built her wonderful, propulsive new novel, The Dutch House, around this idea of the trickiness of memory.The Dutch House is at once a 50-year family saga, and a sort of ""dark fairy tale,"" complete with a modern-day evil stepmother. Siblings Maeve and Danny grow up in a fancy old house in the suburbs of Philadelphia in the mid-1950s (or so). Their mother leaves them at a young age, with no explanation. Danny doesn't remember her, but Maeve (seven years older than Danny) does, and this abandonment is a specter that haunts Maeve both physically and emotionally her whole life.Years later, their father remarries. But their stepmother Andrea is pure evil, and manipulates their father into including her on all his financial holdings, including the Dutch House, and his successful real estate business. It's not long before Andrea kicks teenaged Danny out of the house and essentially cuts him and Maeve off. So Danny has to move in with Maeve who has just graduated from college, and the two begin a long process of navigating life, as once-wealthy and now-on-their-own adults.Everything that happens for the rest of the siblings' lives is a direct result of this childhood/young adult upheaval and how they remember things slightly differently. The two siblings maintain an incredibly close bond their entire lives, even as their lives branch — Maeve staying near home and Danny making a life for himself in New York City. And that's the meat of this novel — how do they overcome their pasts? And more specifically, how do their differing memories of the past inform their current and future relationship? Really fascinating questions.Patchett is her usual captivating self in this novel. Her writing tugs you along in the way of all remarkably talented writers: You don't even realize you're reading. Ever since I read and loved State of Wonder, and then some of her backlist, Patchett is always a must-read for me, and this novel is absolutely one of her best. I loved it. There is so much story here."

His father, Cyril Conroy, from Brooklyn, who took chances and became very wealthy. He bought the beautiful, old Dutch House, which his wife hated. Elna was against being rich. Both of the parents treated strangers much better than they treated their kids. Cyril was a cold, indifferent man, interested in architecture, buying and selling buildings and making money. The Dutch House is located in a high class neighborhood outside Philadelphia.The story is told by Danny about his walk through life and goes over a time of about fifty years. He and his sister, Maeve, are very close. She is seven years older and mothers him, he doesn't remember his mother.Then into their lives comes Andrea, a pretty woman, a friend of Cyril's. It is an indifferent relationship. Andrea comes to the Dutch House, stays, then leaves. She has done that many times, who knows why, but Cyril is wealthy. Then the two get married.

He surprises his wife by buying the Dutch House, a huge mansion in the suburbs. But is it a good surprise?With the house comes a staff of three women who help raise the two children, Maeve and Danny. Their mother seems very unhappy, and disappears from time to time, until one day she leaves and never comes back.Tenacious young widow Andrea sets her sights on Cyril, and their shared love of the Dutch House brings them together. When Cyril marries Andrea, she brings along her two young daughters. Like the wicked stepmother in fairy tales, Andrea bides her time until she can force Maeve and Danny from the Dutch House, and claim it as her own.This devastates Maeve and Danny. They have lost the only home they have ever known, and any connection to their parents. Maeve, who is out in the workforce, takes in her high-school aged brother, and they live together in a small apartment.Danny narrates this beautifully told story as he tries to understand where he fits into this world. Although the narration switches back and forth in time, Patchett is such a skilled writer that it all flows so smoothly, and the reader is never confused.Maeve and Danny occasionally park outside the Dutch House, peering inside and reliving the past while talking about the future. We follow them through college, work, adulthood, and eventually Danny has a marriage and family of his own.Maeve can’t seem to move forward with her life, and she tries to push Danny to go to medical school to become a doctor, but for her own reasons. When Danny meets the woman he wants to marry, she is concerned by how close Danny and Maeve are, and the influence Maeve wields over him. This causes problems for Danny as the two people he loves most don’t like each other.Since we see Maeve through Danny’s eyes, she is perhaps not as well known to the reader. But they have an unshakeable bond that gets tested at the end of the story as they confront their past, the cost of forgiveness, and the meaning of family. I loved The Dutch House and highly recommend it."

I don't know what it is about Ann Patchett, but I am utterly enchanted by her work. Each book is different, yet they are all approachable and unexpected. I am never disappointed (except perhaps by The Magician's Assistant) This is an epic family story writ small, as large as a grand, imposing house and as minute as the invisible threads of loyalty that bind a brother and sister. Danny and Maeve never recovered from being thrown out of the Dutch House, their family home, by their stepmother after their father's death. Now that they are grown with families of their own, the house has become a touchstone that ties them to their dead, largely mysterious father and missing mother, who abandoned them when Danny was a toddler. The mystery and myth that surround their parents haunt them until they finally confront the occupants of the Dutch House one last time, and learn the truth about their father's silence and mother's disappearance. Reader, I loved it. There is nothing I adore more than a quiet domestic drama steeped in grudges and mystery. Get thee a NetGalley account post-haste or enjoy the delicious wait until September."

Au crescut în spectaculoasa Casă Olandeză, pe care tatăl lor, Cyril, a cumpărat-o la scurt timp după sfârșitul Celui de-al Doilea Război Mondial, acesta îmbogățindu-se în urma investițiilor imobiliare. Mama lor, Elna, nu a putut suporta gândul că ei trăiesc într-o asemenea casă, în timp ce alții nu au nici măcar un mic acoperiș deasupra capului, așa că era tot timpul tristă și pleca deseori mult timp de acasă pentru a îi ajuta pe cei nevoiași. Până într-o zi, când a plecat de tot! Plecarea Elnei a lăsat răni adânci în sufletele celor rămași în urmă, în special în sufletele copiilor. Maeve s-a îmbolnăvit, dar după ce s-a pus pe picioare, a devenit o adevărată mamă pentru Danny. Cyril s-a închis în el, iar după mulți ani, a încercat să își refacă viața cu o altă femeie, Andrea. Aceasta va avea un rol decisiv în viețile celor 2 frați, întrucât îi dă afară din casă după moartea lui Cyril și îi lasă în voia sorții. Mă opresc aici cu detaliile despre acțiune, și așa am zis cam multe! Mi-a plăcut foarte mult cartea, îmi venea așa s-o strâng la piept. Deși este o poveste tristă în mare parte, a emanat așa o căldură, încât mi-a topit sufletul! Îmi venea să intru în carte și să îi mângâi pe Danny și Maeve pentru a le alina durerea, să o scutur bine pe Elna pentru a o face să se întoarcă la copiii ei, să îi deschid ochii lui Cyril pentru a realiza că Andrea este doar pe interes, să o iau de păr pe Andrea și să o dau afară din casă! Ohhhhh, prin câte stări nu m-a trecut! Casa Olandeză a fost și ea un adevărat personaj, la care toți ceilalți s-au întors într-un fel sau altul. Coperta are și ea o poveste: este tabloul lui Maeve la varsta de 10 ani, tablou atât de frumos descris în carte. ""Există momente în viață când faci un salt în timp și trecutul în care erai bine instalat se năruie în urma ta, iar viitorul pe care vrei să îl atingi cu piciorul nu e încă bine conturat, și astfel rămâi un timp suspendat în aer, nemaiștiind nimic și pe nimeni, nemaiștiind nici măcar cine ești tu însuți."""

So much so that he surprises his wife with a huge home that he bought in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania. His wife, Elna, thought they were poor, so The Dutch House, aptly named for its former Dutch residents, is a surprise she necessarily wanted. It's a foreboding mansion and isn't one that she would choose to raise her family in. Nonetheless, the Conroys move in along with their young daughter, Maeve. Many years later and their son, Danny, comes along, but one thing remains the same. Elna doesn't like living at the Dutch House with its sprawling rooms and ominous portraits staring back at her. One day Elna leaves and doesn't return, which leaves Fluffy, the nanny, to help raise the two Conroy children as their father is really hands off. Obviously, the moment their mother leaves and doesn't return is one that truly shapes Maeve's life as she is ten years old. Danny is much younger and can bounce back a bit, but this leaves a hole in Maeve's heart. A few years later, Cyril starts seeing someone new and to complicate matters further, this woman has two young daughters. Cyril marries the new Mrs. Conroy, who loves the old Pennsylvania mansion, and now Maeve and Danny find themselves with a new stepmother and two young stepsisters. The new Mrs. Conroy is exactly what you would expect from a quintessential stepmother straight out of a fairy tale. She is cold, she is manipulative, and she doesn't like Maeve or Danny. Without giving too much away, Maeve and Danny find themselves in dire circumstances when their stepmother wants them out of the house. Maeve and Danny find themselves on their own and facing poverty. The Dutch House by Ann Patchett is a brilliant study in human behavior; it's a story that truly made me linger and soak up each memorable scene.Read the rest of my review here: http://www.confessionsofabookaddict.c..."

Their mother left them when they were young and their father remarried to another woman with two young daughters. Their father died suddenly and their stepmother somehow finagled things with her lawyer that she ended up inheriting all of her husband’s properties, including The Dutch House. She kicked off Danny and Maeve from their home, but Danny was able to get an education trust fund from their father’s estate. Danny and Maeve goes on with their lives but somehow keep finding themselves drawn to The Dutch House.One thing for certain is that Ann Patchett is a wonderful storyteller. There’s a steady flow to Ms. Patchett’s writing peppered with wit and humor throughout. I was instantly hooked with the story and was thoroughly invested in both Danny and Maeve, as well as the other occupants of The Dutch House (Sandy, Jocelyn & Fluffy). I hated their evil stepmother and started wishing the worst possible outcome for her. 🤣In spite of what happened to Danny and Maeve, there is so much heart in this story. There is a lot about confronting your past, forgiveness, and coming home(although not what you may expect). What also resonated with me in this story is how things always come full circle and sometimes you have to let go in order to move forward. One thing I didn’t like was that the ending seems rushed. Without going into spoilers, I wish Patchett squeezed more emotion from that one major event. There was enough foreshadowing that it was going to happen, and my heart was ready for that inevitable heartbreak, but once we got there it was disappointingly anticlimactic.Despite that one negative thing, I still wholeheartedly enjoyed this novel. Big bonus point that I listened to the audiobook version which was narrated Tom Hanks. Now I can actually envision this book being adapted to a movie with Tom Hanks playing an older Danny Conroy. 😍"

I really enjoyed her character development and the flawed people and dysfunctional families. I found her observations of human nature to be smart and witty.In The Dutch House we live with one family for five decades. They are broken and have shared a lot of pain. Danny (our main character) and his sister Maeve are very close and have a relationship that sometimes baffles others in their lives. The title of the book refers to the home that they grew up in. Their father bought the house as a gift for their mother. The house is drawn in a way that it serves as a character in the story which is something I really enjoyed. Patchett created a sense of place so real and vivid that I felt I had been in that home myself.The narrative moves back and forth in time through five decades, and we watch as Dutch House is a trigger for the events in the lives of the family. Danny and Maeve's mother leaves, their father grows more distant, and Maeve finds herself in the role of Danny's protector. She is his caretaker; much more than a sister. Their father remarries, and his new wife and her children move into the home. She is ambitious, and often cruel. When their father dies their stepmother throws them out of the home, and they plummet from lives of privilege to ones of poverty. Neither of them can let go of their past and are obsessed with the home of their childhood.The book is about family, love, loyalty, grief, obsession, forgiveness and acceptance. It is thought-provoking, well written and I enjoyed it very much. Despite the fact that the ending felt appropriate and brought things full circle, I was disappointed. It felt out of place and rushed.*****you can also find me:https://www.facebook.com/Kelly-Hunsak...and:www.instagram.com/kelly_hunsaker_reads"
794,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7310558-liina-haabu,Rating 3 out of 5,"The Dutch House has first-rate storytelling - I read almost half of it on one rainy Sunday. We follow a brother and a sister from childhood into adulthood. A family saga, as it is marketed I believe. Patchett steps back and forth in time with remarkable ease - the reader is never confused and even though it is a quiet book there is enough tension to keep turning the pages. All this may easily lure one into thinking it is a five fat stars kind of novel. Only that it isn’t. That is because the plot is just so ridiculous at times and the lives of the characters so far from the common reality of modern-day Americans that it becomes almost a parody of itself.Everybody goes to med school with full tuition paid (and by the way whine about not wanting to become a doctor but still finishing their studies), a mother leaves their children and is forgiven in almost a blink of an eye upon her return, real estate developments succeed with only one passing mention of the unbelievable stress the risks of them bring along, acting careers succeed and in the end, all the storylines come together neatly. I like my novels with more believable drama and characters with flaws and lives that don’t always work out for the best. But as I said - the writing amends this major flaw of this novel pretty well. It reminded me of Donna Tartt, especially her Goldfinch (the main themes are similar though Tartt did the hurt of losing a parent more convincingly). The first two-thirds of Patchetts's book went by like a breeze and only in the last third did The Dutch House started to really irritate me. But I can see the appeal of it. It as a very distinct American feel (similar to Paul Auster novels) and reading it feels like watching a good movie where everyone lives in a brownstone, men play basketball and all the children look adorable. But that is not what life is like. And that is why it is a pretty mediocre novel in my opinion."

And the fixation with the house I found quite odd to be honest. I kept asking myself - is this book really just going to be about grief and anger over a house?But at the heart of the book is a reflection on the rawness of human spirit: how different people can forgive more easily than others and how some are more generous in spirit than others. The structure of the book as I alluded to above I found unweighted - the first two-thirds was consumed by endless focus around how two disgruntled people losing a house to a nasty step-mother were bitter and could not move on. Patchett examined the grief around losing their father and never feeling any sense of connection to him in the first section of the book, however we did not really see these two characters grow until their mother re-entered their lives and taught them generosity and forgiveness in the last third of the book - and then what progressed after that just felt so rushed. Far more could have been made of Danny's relationship with his daughter May, and his son who ended up following his original career path as a doctor, but who was able to approach such a profession with a completely different mind-set to his father's. The book just didn't leave me walking away moved, I think because the awakening was left such little time in the book. You saw nasty protagonists for too long, and then when the good emerged, it was rushed and lacked emotional detail and the all important journey some people need to go through in order to forgive."

And then I heard she had a new book coming out — The Dutch House. And then I saw the cover. It's a cover that can't be ignored. And then a friend gave me an extra copy, and I couldn't wait to start it. But then I learned Tom Hanks narrates the audio version, so you know what had to happen next.I downloaded the audio book and was immediately immersed. The Dutch House is such a great story. It's a story of a beautiful house that tears a family apart. It's a story about a motherless brother and sister (Danny and Maeve) with an unbreakable bond. It's a story about horrible choices. A story where the house is as much a character as the people in it. A house so remarkable, I wanted it to exist in real life. I wanted to go see the Dutch House. I wanted to experience the Dutch House.As Tom's familiar voice and easy cadence filled my car, I found myself longing for more time with my parents (who, thankfully are still here). I became wistful for dusk-filled skies, sitting with my grandparents on a lazy summer evenings. As Danny and Maeve sat in their car week after week across the street from the Dutch House contemplating their unexpected banishment from the property, I was brought back to the many nights my best friend and I would escape our college campus, late at night, and drive through the desert solving our problems and contemplating life's questions.

The characters are very well written and the story has a fairy tale like quality to it. Danny and Maeve are a brother and sister who are abandoned by their mother at an early age. They are left with their emotionally distant father and are brought up in an enchanting mansion which is almost its own character. The story is told through Danny's perspective who is a lot younger than Maeve. I love how the past is revealed to him and how everything connects in the end. A great read!
799,no user info,Rating 3 out of 5,"Wow, this book was such a mixed bag! First, I have to say that Ann Patchett is great author. This is the 4th book I've read by her. Bel Canto was one of my all time favorite books, really what I consider a masterpiece. I also read ""Run"" and ""Truth and Beauty"", also well written and I believe I rated each of them 4 stars (Bel Canto 5). So leaving less than 3 stars for a book that is so well written was impossible. This book was also very well written. However, this shows that a book can be very well written, but not have much substance. When I look at this story, it's just dark, kind of dull and doesn't really go anywhere. There is so much reference to this house, the dutch house, that I was starting to cringe at yet another description of a room or a fond memory someone had in the house. The characters are just okay. I listened to this on audio mainly because Tom Hanks narrated and I thought he was great. SPOILER******The two main characters in the book, Danny (the narrator) and his sister were the main characters in the book. They kept my interest because of they were close siblings. They went through a rough time when their father died. Mauve, the sister, really took care of Danny at that point. Danny got kicked out of the dutch house by his step mother. This part of the book, when Danny went to boarding school and then college, and then Mauve worked and he stayed with her until he was on his own, I found this to be interesting and wondered where it was going. Here's where it went--to the two of them going back to the damn dutch house and just sitting outside it in a car, looking at it and talking about their childhoods and speculating about their lives. The book just never got much better. In fact, it got rather depressing. Toward the end of the book, I couldn't wait for it to be over."

I really didn’t know what I was signing up for and was neither prepared for the in-depth narration nor for the emotional investment I put into each character.

But, eventually, I could stop turning the pages as I started myself reading this book. The story telling is so brilliant one could instantly absorb itself in the story, feel the way characters were feeling and in no time I got too attached to the character. The characters are so real and related-able, you laugh at them,love them, hate them, get angry over them and yet you forgive them.The book follows the story of two siblings, Maeve and Danny, and the house where everything got started. As the days passed things started to get disorder, their mother abandoning both, their father marrying a second wife, the death of their father, a eventually getting exiled from their own house and compelled to leave their house. The story is narrated from the view-point of Danny, where as he describes, their life's story drifting in and out from past to the present, encountering people whom they thought would never meet. Though separated from 'The Dutch house', unknowingly their heart always stayed where their childhood rested, it's their past that they could never let go off, the past shaping them what they became at the end. A gripping tale of sibling, family, relationship, their memories, love that never perish and about what life could actually throw at you even when you are too sincere to realized. I am utterly delighted to read this piece of work. The only sad part about this book is, it ends."

Typically, I love a fictional story about siblings. It's one of my favorite relationships to analyze, and some of my favorite books that have interesting sibling dynamics include The Nest or Everything I Never Told You. In The Dutch House, Danny and his stoic older sister Maeve struggle with forgiveness of a parent in a way that felt messy, realistic, painful, and hit really really close to home. Their own relationship isn't perfect, but on more than one occasion brought tears to my eyes. Like everyone else who listened to the Tom Hanks narration, the audio book is wonderful. Bravo to whoever made that decision. For about the first 20 minutes, I kept thinking TomHanks, TomHanks, TomHanks. But as I got into the story, he really becomes Danny and I could have listened to another 9 hours of his story. There were also many time while listening to this that I wished I could talk about it with my mom, who liked Ann Patchett and now this is the second book of hers that she's missed.

With absolute ease and understanding, Mr Hanks slips into the character of Danny Conroy. His performance captures the tone with excellence. I do hope this is just the first of many book narrations for him!The Dutch House expertly explores the depth of a sibling relationship in the context of a behemoth grandiose mansion-sized house and how it shaped the lives of Maeve and Danny. Patchett expertly captures, with acute insight, a brother and sister's singular experience of growing up in the specter and shadow of this house. At times, The Dutch House seems like a dark fairy tale complete with a not-so-nice stepmother. What I loved most was how well Patchett explores that no one can understand Maeve and Danny's particular childhood except them. She captures their bond so deftly that I understood Celeste's (Danny's wife) frustration and jealousy over his connection with his sister. I also loved the grand description of the windows and the ornate details of The Dutch House. It felt like a mystery I could not crack, a mystery, I did not want to crack. I really liked that the house contained secrets. I also loved that at the heart of this novel is a painting of Maeve as a young girl. The painting is at the crux of a dysfunctional family that did not know how to handle the transition from poverty to wealth.The Dutch House is a fine example of quiet character study and how the sense of place shapes who we become.

Love this man! His perfect voice and amazing nonverbal skills really brought the best of the story. Yes, audio books are books too, I dont care what anyone says. It takes the same amount of time and maybe even more attention. I am not a lazy reader. If anything, I'm not lazy at all, that is why I dont have 2 free hands all the time! But back to this beauty 😍.And it goes like this: Dannys father Cyril gets rich and buys the Dutch House, a lavish estate where their family of 4 should be able to find their happily ever after. But, the house sets something in motion. Something that threatenes to destroy the Conroys...No, this is not horror or thriller. Nothing of that sort. Its a the most captivating family saga. We get to follow a bunch of wholesome characters through decades. Watch how their life paths separate only to become oddly brought back together in this orchestra of destiny. The main outline is the brother sister bond, but it is so much more. A glimpse into WWII and economy, a marrital parody, handbook of forgiveness.❤️To me, this book is embodiment of why I love books and reading. To dwell in the cadre od unperfect humans trying to get their world on the feet. Learning about every single mistake, happines and atonement. This book made me wish I was in a bookclub so I could debate over every single scene and exchange. Like, how hipocrite it is to condemn women who refuse to accept motherhood, but the same doesnt apply to men. I could go on and on..."
807,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10706354-kevidently,Rating 5 out of 5,"What a glorious novel! The Dutch House is the story of a brother and sister, Danny and Maeve, and the house they grew up in. The Dutch House remains the center of their lives, both physically and metaphorically, even when they no longer live there, and even when the house isn’t technically theirs. It’s also the story of parents: Danny and Maeve’s father, their mother, and their stepmother ... and Maeve herself as she becomes Danny’s caretaker. It’s how the mistakes of the past echo on the dreams on the future, but not violently, as you’d expect with a book whose beginning is as tumultuous as this one. The echoes are gentle, nudging, and yet so exciting and involving that you’re compelled to read on, gobbling up the next sentence and paragraph and chapter.To say much more would be to spoil all the twists. The first one, the big one, knocked me for a hell of a loop, and then they all kept coming. All of them shocked me, and all of them built logically out of the story and these fascinating characters. By the end of the book, I was fully in love with every person in it, and wanted to know everything about their lives. I was greedy for closure, and when I got it, I wanted more story. That’s how good The Dutch House is: you wish it would continue indefinitely. What a glorious novel."
808,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26041131-julie,Rating 5 out of 5,"I fell in love with the characters and this novel by the time I finished the first chapter. I was all in for the journey. Though, I’m not sure the narrator/protagonist was the right choice to tell this story. The novel is about childhood. More specifically, it’s about our memories of what was and what we wish was and wasn’t. It has the flavor of a Grimm or Anderson fairy tale, as the story revolves around siblings who are in the world sans a parent or two. It even has a wicked stepmother. The story also touches on the can of worms that are childhood homes. The siblings of this novel have a fabulous and unusual childhood home. It’s almost another character in the novel. It is the center of this story and has a strong gravitational pull. The novel was very well written. The novel travels around in time a bit as there is a sense of looking back on all of it. At all points in the novel, the protagonist is looking back. To the original owners of the Dutch House, to the time before moving into the Dutch House, to losing family and then the Dutch House. The novel comes full circle in the end but in an unexpected way. It touches on things that are hard to understand like a mother abandoning her children to care for the children of others without parents. It explores forgiveness and letting go and how we repaint our childhood memories whether we know it or not. "
809,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1927745-sharman-russell,Rating 5 out of 5,"What I particularly appreciate in this novel is how the characters were angry and then…let go their anger. That’s not supposed to happen in fiction. Anger builds and creates conflict and drama and sets that drama and conflict in motion and thus you have an exciting story. People don’t let go. People don’t evolve. People don’t behave well. And thus you have tragedy. I also like that this different approach to people and their emotions doesn’t mean that bad things don’t happen to these same people—that there weren’t divorces or disappointments or deaths. But in critical ways—in the ways we can control our responses to what happens to us—these main characters were models of a sort and people I wanted to spend time with.As with other Pratchett novels I have read, the characters live in a privileged world of resources: money, education, and a socialized understanding of art and beauty. I assume this is the world the author knows best, and so she writes about that world, and she writes about it with humor and compassion and depth. I’m glad, of course, that there are other authors writing about other worlds, maybe ones I resonate with more. I felt quite like a visitor in this novel, rather than at home. But literature is about visiting, too."
810,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53329-abby-johnson,No Rating,"I am a huge fan of Ann Patchett and I loved her upcoming new novel about a family whose lives center around a sprawling mansion they call The Dutch House. Narrated by Danny, a baby when his mother left and a small child when his father remarried a woman who never really accepted him and his sister, the tale follows Danny and his biological sister Maeve as they grow up and experience Circumstances. No spoilers, but I was just enthralled by the characters. Reviews have said that some of the characters are not wholly fleshed out, but I read it as because the story's narrated by a younger brother. Danny's pretty clueless about anything that's not centered around him, so to me it feels natural that he doesn't have the whole story about even his sister who he's closest with. Fans of family dramas and historical fiction (set in the 1960s-80s, mostly) and especially stories about strong sibling relationships will like this one. Even though it is NOT fantasy, it reminded me a lot of Alice Hoffman's THE RULES OF MAGIC. I think fans of Barbara Kingsolver's THE UNSHELTERED will also like it (although I much preferred DUTCH HOUSE). "
811,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28105228-alison-hardtmann,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Dutch House is named after the first owners, a Dutch American family that made their fortune, then lost it in the Depression. When Maeve moves into the opulently furnished house with her parents she has no idea of how that house will shape her life. Told from her brother's point of view, Ann Patchett's novel follows Maeve, an intelligent, resourceful girl who is constrained by both familial and societal expectations into caring for her younger brother after they lose their mother, and pouring all of her dreams and aspirations into him and into the Dutch House. This is a quiet novel, and while Danny and his father are the ones who make the choices, the novel centers on Maeve and her relationships with her mother, her step-mother and her daughter-in-law as she lives her life through her brother and through her obsession with the house of her childhood. Patchett is a talented writer and she writes brilliantly about the not always easy relationships between women. It's a cliché to say that the house is a character in its own right, but Patchett writes so evocatively about a specific time and place. This is an extraordinary novel."

I spent November complaining about the fact that I was desperate to read a great and captivating novel but I couldn’t find it. The Dutch House, released last September, is that novel.This book tells the story of Maeve and Danny Conroy, two siblings that see their life completely changed after the death of their father. Their paradise is gone. This is a tender and engrossing story about love, forgiveness and inheritance.Everything about this novel worked for me. The writing is super engrossing, the characters were real and extremely interesting. The pace of this narrative was perfect, keeping myself interested in the book at all times. I think The Dutch House is the perfect read for the holidays and would make an amazing gift! The cover is also superb, seriously! Funny story: I read this book when I was home but also listened to the audiobook when I was out. The narrator was incredible and I was like: this guy's doing an amazing job!! And, then, I realized it was Tom Hanks. I didn’t know he narrated audiobooks but he does it pretty well! 4.5🌟Thanks to Harper Collins for the gifted copy.

813,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/909198-mary,Rating 5 out of 5,"Dutch House was a binge read for me. The characters of Maeve and Danny were fascinating. In so much of 19th century literature, children are missing one or both parents and must make their way in the world. Patchett does not leave us without an evil stepmother either. Andrea is a grasping selfish woman. She wants to possess the Dutch House and all the other trappings of upper middle class life. She has no room in her heart or the house for Danny and Maeve. So Maeve and Danny’s survival depend on Maeve. She is a self reliant and intelligent young woman who doesn’t let her Catholic faith get in the way of her need for justice of a sort. The real mystery of the story is their mother. All who know her swear that she is a saint who abandoned her children knowing they would be cared for by others, so she can help less fortunate children. Patchett leaves readers speculating on whether the families of saints aren’t all dissatisfied with their saints. I am sure all the children of the men and women who serve the public as physicians, ministers, and other professions where family life is intruded on by the outside world frequently will relate to this novel.

We're taught to always be grateful for gifts, but in truth, gift-giving and receiving can be fraught with disaster. And that's the inciting incident of THE DUTCH HOUSE. Cyril Connolly buys his wife a fabulous house as a ""surprise"" and the gift backfires so spectacularly that the after-effects reverberate through three generations. I adored the characters in this book--they were all flawed, but all basically good people (except for the evil stepmother). As an only child, I was fascinated by the sibling relationship at the center of the novel. And of course, I love this cover! Ann Patchett commissioned an artist to paint a real painting of the fictional painting of the fictional Maeve that hangs in the Dutch House. And what a gorgeous painting it is! I love Ann Patchett, and this is her best book since Bel Canto, which remains my favorite. But this is a close second. Highly recommended. "

She writes characters and familial relationships with such skill. Childhood abandonment plays out over decades for siblings Danny and Maeve. “There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past you’d been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet in place, and for a moment you’re suspended, knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself.” p121Danny and older sister Maeve hang onto each other and the touchstone of their house, The Dutch House, for dear life, at the expense of other relationships (Celeste deserved so much better!) and personal growth (Maeve!). Eventually, the siblings are confronted by the past. Old wounds are reopened and past traumas faced. They each find their own unexpected path to understanding and healing. “The rage I carried for my mother exhaled and died. There was no place for it anymore. What I was left with was never love, but it was something-familiarity maybe.”p331"

For this book, I was neither. Ok, I was entertained for maybe like 3 hours because of Tom Hanks voice, but Tom can only distract you for so long from the fact that you’re listening to something so boring that’s only going to get worse. Overall, I was very underwhelmed by this book, and just couldn’t empathize with or feel any sort of emotional connection to any of the characters—and frankly, found them annoying and like they were “woe is me” the whole time. Get your shit together and stop complaining!!! You have a free ride to college and medical school that you don’t even want to go to!!!!! 🙄🙄🙄🙄!!!!!! You have your sister, you have each other!!! But the tone is sooo negative the whole time and by hour 10 of listening I was just like K BYE.

There's not one single word out of place or sentence that isn't glorious to read in The Dutch House. Her characterization is so subtle and slow-building, and I loved that she used Danny for our first-person limited narrator. I read other reviews that found him selfish, annoying, and pompous. I don't know if I misread the book, but I found him funny, charming, kind, and, albeit ignorant to his privilege, a pleasure to spend a 400 page novel with. The Dutch House examines the many dynamics of family relationships and exposes what is both tragic and hilarious about them. It's also a fascinating story about the mending of relationships. Patchett explores the idea of how much stress a relationship can withstand before cracking, and whether or not it can ever be fully repaired. And on top of all of that, this book was funny! There were multiple times when I laughed out loud at the dialogue between Maeve and Danny. Overall, just a joy to read from beginning to end."
818,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/930401-maya-lang,Rating 5 out of 5,"I didn't love this book at first based on its opening pages—that imposing house, formidable and chilly. I felt I was on the outside. But then slowly this book opened up, inviting me in, until I was immersed, with no idea how it had happened, a kind of magic trick. I love its beguiling chronology. It moves back and forth in time, as memory does, casting us back. You never know where the next chapter of this book will take you, where (or when) it will open, the same way that we never know where our own thoughts might land, yet I was with it, in it, not wanting it to end. Its mood—melancholic—reminded me a bit of The Goldfinch, though of course it is not nearly as detailed or sprawling or vast, far more contained and tidy, in the way that Patchett's writing is always tidy and purposeful. I especially admired the notion of the prodigal mother, Odysseus via the matriarch. When do mothers choose themselves? What happens to them if they do? Patchett has taken a risk in daring to take on this theme. This novel holds volumes of ideas. It is one I will want to re-read."
819,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27884607-bonnie-dennis,Rating 2 out of 5,"Not what I was expecting I did not enjoy this book. I blame this largely on the description- particularly the claim that it’s a “fairy tale” and that there is a lot of “suspense.” It is neither of those things. It follows one emotionally closed-off guy with a sort of vaguely depressing life that kind of weirdly revolves around his sister. It’s poignant at parts, but ultimately just completely not relatable for me. His wife, Celeste, seemed to be the character I identified with the most, but she’s only mentioned sparingly. I’m not sure how the publisher defines a “fairy tale,” but this is honestly about as far from a fairy tale as I can imagine. It is completely mundane. As far as suspense... I can say that there were a couple of times that I experienced... a passing curiosity. That might be overstating it, though. Overall, not an engaging story or characters. I can say that the writing is eloquent. But the plot is a yawner."
820,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3179289-kristina,Rating 5 out of 5,"Every time I read an Ann Patchett novel, I'm reminded of her ability to create sympathetic, yet realistic characters within the first few chapters. I went into 'The Dutch House' not knowing too much about the story and then realized it was a twentieth-century version of a fairy tale---motherless brother and sister Danny Conroy, our narrator, and his older sister Maeve, are of differing opinions about their father's new lady friend. Soon it will become apparent that Andrea, a pretty young widow with two little girls, is much more interested in their family home aka---""the Dutch house"" than she probably is in wealthy, quirky, divorced dad Cyril, but her entrance to the family is a plot catalyst.To say more about what happens to Danny and Maeve wouldn't be fair, but I will say that once I realized Tom Hanks was the narrator for the audiobook, I returned my hard copy and quickly downloaded it from Audible. He is the perfect narrator for this story. "

The whole way through I didn’t want to stop listening, and on the occasion when I did have to pause to go and do something else I found myself thinking about the characters.But what did I like about this book exactly? That’s hard to say. It’s a generational tale, of both a family and a house, but I can’t say that anything big really happens. It’s more like everyday life unfolding. But Ann Patchett’s characters are so wonderfully rich and real and you really feel like you get to know them on a deep level.

Patchett makes you feel unbelievably emotionally invested in the lives and wellbeing of the characters she has created. She is not afraid to jump between the past and the present and the future at any point in the story; she offers you all the necessary crumbs to find your way towards the ultimate destination of the story while still taking you by surprise in many ways once you do reach it. The way she crafts these people's stories and the way she puts the idea of the Dutch House either at the center of their stories or looming ominously at the periphery is phenomenal. Patchett subtly uses fairytale elements while crafting a slice of life type story and the result is nothing short of fabulous. I can see many different types of people enjoying this book

I'm so glad I didn't write her off as not for me based on that book because I absolutely love The Dutch House. I'm not even sure what drew me to it or why I requested it from the library (maybe someone's positive review?), but I really loved reading it. It's got very believable characters who are also interesting and flawed, and while there isn't really what I'd call a strong plot, there is a strong story of a family.

This is a love story...not romantic, but a deep, abiding love between two siblings, Maeve and Danny, who were abandoned by their mother when they were young. They grew up in the Dutch House of the title, a stately mansion in the Philadelphia suburbs, with their distant father, and really looked after by the household staff. But when their father ends up marrying a much younger woman with two daughters of her own, their lives will change drastically. This novel is such a generous, warm-hearted character study...done so beautifully by the gifted Anne Patchett. Do not pick this one up if you're looking for a propulsive plot.

It’s that kind of book.I felt such anger and pain on behalf of these characters! Then I felt such intense resentment at being asked to understand and forgive other characters who did unforgivable things. I had Big Feelings reading this book. But I came around and eventually felt the relief and peace we all feel when we allow ourselves to choose grace. I don’t know how else to explain it. You can choose to hang on to resentment and pain, or you can choose grace and forgiveness, no matter how unfair it may seem.

Ann Patchett’s extraordinary storytelling narrated by the one and only Tom Hanks is a match made in heaven. I could listen to this straight through again. Important to note that throughout the first hour I wondered where the story was, and if there was a plot. And then. And then I sank right in and became a piece of the house, a sibling to Danny and Maeve, a part of the city and its real estate, a representation of both the living and the dead. I don’t know how she does it. It’s not magic. It doesn’t feel complicated. But Patchett spirals in and out with her stories and makes room for the reader to join at every new twist and turn.

The beginning of the novel is really fast-paced and gets you hooked but after that, it all went downhill for me.

834,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/576203-sera,Rating 5 out of 5,"I became fully immersed in this story about a sister and brother coming of age in Philadelphia and later NYC. At the center of this tale is the Dutch House, which becomes its own character in the story, by directly impacting some of the decisions that the characters make it in this book that have long-lasting effects. This book is character-driven, which some readers may find to be slow moving. I agree that it's not an action packed read, but there are twists and turns that occur that surprised me as a reader. I also really enjoyed the relationship of the two siblings in this book. I was rooting for both of them to have happy and healthy lives.I highly recommend this book, and I have heard that Tom Hanks reads the book on the audio version. "

Are you kidding me ? Maybe the members of jury couldn't read but i can and with all due respect to fans of Ann Patchett's books , The Dutch House is a pointless book full of shallow characters . I couldn't care less about Danny the narrator , his tall sister , his idiot father , his stupid mother , his cartoonish devil stepmother , his cheap vengeful wife , his kids , his stepsisters , his nanny , his money , his medical training , his meaningless conversations and above all his bloody childhood house . I will never ever touch any other Ann Patchett's books . I promise ! I swear to the beard of Dostoevsky and the moustache of Shakespeare . So help me God !"

837,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/135956107-hina,Rating 4 out of 5,"The Dutch House is a beautiful and emotionally gripping novel. Ann Patchett has woven a complex family saga that explores love, loss, and the enduring bond between siblings. The characters are richly drawn, and their relationships are both heartwarming and heartbreaking. The house itself is almost a character in its own right, an enchanting and mysterious backdrop for the story. Patchett writes with a lyrical, understated style that captures the reader from the very beginning. This is a truly unforgettable novel that will stay with you long after you've finished reading it."
838,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43400334-carriebeth-garrett,Rating 5 out of 5,"I am deeply in love with this book. As soon as I finished, I started again and found that it was if I was reading a companion book. I saw the characters through different eyes the second time around. I love it even more for Patchett’s skillful and beautiful way of writing a story that shimmers differently depend on how the lights of our eyes read it. My favorite quote from the book is, ”We overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we are not seeing as the people we were, we're seeing it as the people we a, and that means the past is radically altered.” "
839,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1740304-linda,Rating 4 out of 5,"I've been meaning to read this ever since David Sedaris raved about it at one of his readings. It's my first Ann Patchett, but I'm adding her to my list.Well-paced, beautifully written family tale of siblings Danny and Maeve from childhood to middle age, with all the comfort, humor, grief, regret, grudges and forgiveness that entails. And a house with a lot of character.I'm a little impressed that it's an epic spanning half a century, without being stupidly long.Tom Hanks narration is perfect, and he really seemed to have fun with it. I love the swooping tones he uses to announce some chapters."
840,no user info,Rating 2 out of 5,"I've been a fan of Ann Patchett since her early works, but this book is a case of her buying into her own accolades. The writing lacks forward momentum and much of it feels like she is trying to show the reader how smart she is. It's very much a character driven novel, but it takes so long to figure out who the people are that by the time you know them, you no longer care. So much attention is put on the house that Danny and Maeve aren't given enough of the narrative. I know people love this book, but I couldn't get into it and thought it fell pretty flat."

We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.”A modern-day fairy tale complete with a wicked step-mother. Not many writers can do the family dynamics theme quite as well as Patchett does. I imagine a reader with a complicated history involving step family members might especially relate to this story. Tom Hanks does an excellent job narrating the audio version. Definitely a good listen!"
842,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2184808-charlotte-burt,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is a difficult book to review, without giving you huge spoilers. It is about Danny who narrates in the first person who is telling us about his childhood in the Dutch House of the title. He and his sister are both haunted by the house and the life they could have had. Their mother left when Danny was a baby and her loss haunted his entire life. Their stepmother betrays them and they both have to grow up fast. I almost gave it five stars but it does jump around in time a bit too much for my liking. "
843,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83410007-k-j-ramsey,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is a story about the way we struggle to step into stories of life when people betray us and our place is lost. It’s an exquisite example of how we get stuck in storylines that shroud rather than stretch. It shows, in piercing, even mundane detail, how we strive to retell stories that keep us stuck and struggle to relinquish their hold. It’s also a story of forgiveness and coming home, and it left me with the singular taste of wanting to live and love well now by making peace with the past.It’s a bit slow at first, but I felt it built to a glorious, soul-stirring end. Hang with it."
844,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3466126-kathryn-casey,Rating 4 out of 5,"I thought this book started out a little slow, but maybe 20 percent in I became involved with the characters. The house is a character in the book, giving the story continuity. It's a good book to make one think about life and how it slowly unfolds and sometimes takes unfortunate turns. It reminds one of how much in life we do to please others, how we perhaps too often bargain for one thing by giving up another, and how anger is ultimately destructive. Yet in the end, fences are mended and much of what was wrong is righted."
845,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3679784-drew,Rating 3 out of 5,"A totally fine slice of literary fiction. I appreciated, particularly in the early goings, Patchett's experiments in chronology -- but the novel sags irrevocably in the back half and I found myself asking why I was meant to care. Danny, the narrator, is an often frustrating character and while Patchett delivers her usual beautiful prose and deep characterization, I found the hazy memory-play aspects of this book to be frustrating by about the 2/3rds mark. Not on par, for me, with Patchett's best works."
846,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1669005-melissa,Rating 5 out of 5,"Absolutely amazing!Three generations, but contemporary, not some sweeping poetic historical fiction (though heaven knows I love those too). The truth and realness of these characters was breathtaking. I kept waiting for some giant plot twist; but just like real life, the most predictable thing is exactly what happened 99% of the time. The love, the hurt, the laughter, and the shocking changes that are the only constants in life are highlighted with a deftness I have hardly experienced before. "

This story would have lost one star if not for his narration.The whole novel is centered around two relationship a bother and sister abandoned by their mother as young children and their relationship with the house they grew up in. The famous dutch house was meant to be a gift for their mother, but it turned out to be the thing that drove her away. This story chronicles the life of everyone in it in relation to the house and its effect on them."
848,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31175766-kathy,Rating 4 out of 5,"A richly woven, very American, multi-generational family tale. Our guide through the generations is the son of a man who used his wits to invest in property throughout his life, starting with the payoff from a tip from a soldier in hospital. That soldier also had a connection to the house that anchors and connects the lives of the many characters portrayed in the story.The family relationships, life choices and important events revolve around the Dutch House, an elaborate structure shed by a Dutch entrepreneur who gained wealth through cigarettes.Library Loan"
849,no user info,Rating 2 out of 5,The Dutch House is an unexceptional family saga replete with all of the attendant miseries and dichotomies of modern existence. There's hardly a bromide left untouched. Patchett is a capable writer who breathes life into her characters but this time out she forgets to set them in a convincing story. The plotting was inexplicably sluggish and the characters' actions too frequently unnatural. Readable if you have nothing better on the shelf but instantly forgettable.

896,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49094939-cindy-tebo,Rating 4 out of 5,"In Ann Patchett’s, The Dutch House, the house itself is as important to the architecture of the story as the novel’s characters. The house is like no other one in the neighborhood because it is constructed primarily of glass. Anyone can see inside. The building has a museum quality to it—a place to visit occasionally but who would want to live there? Then, again, what makes a house, a home? While our lives may unfold inside its walls, what happens when we are forced to leave the security we once found there? These are just some of the important questions that I considered while reading this novel.Danny, the narrator of the story, is thrown out of the Dutch house shortly after his father dies. His stepmother, Andrea, has two young daughters of her own and wants nothing to do with Danny or his sister, Maeve. He has nowhere else to go so he moves in with his sister.They manage to become successful in their own lives but keep returning to the Dutch house as though they were somehow psychologically tethered here. While it’s natural for adults to want to see their childhood home as a source of curiosity, it’s rare they keep going back again and again as do Danny and Maeve. Perhaps if they had not been forced to leave, it would have been different. Or if their birth mother, Elna, hadn’t left them when they were young. Danny barely remembers her other than the fact that she had deserted them. Is it the house that drew them back or the last memories of their mother? In a moment of revelation, Maeve says, “Our father was a man who had never met his own wife.” At one time, Elna was preparing to become a nun. Cyril, Maeve and Danny’s father, talked her out of it. Elna married him. She had ideas of a simple life—one where she could be of service to others. Apparently, Cyril never understood this. Instead, he buys, ""The Dutch House,"" a glass mansion. He assumes that Elna will love it because he loves it. Not only does he buy her a mansion, but he hires a servant, so Elna doesn’t have to do a thing. She no longer cooks or cleans house. It never crossed Cyril’s mind that Elna enjoyed doing those things.In essence, she isn’t needed. Or so that’s how Elna feels. This is not the life she wants for herself. Elna needs to be needed so she leaves her two children on a mission to serve in India. She justifies this by thinking her children will be in good hands with Cyril and the servants (at this point, there’s more than one servant.) She doesn’t see how this will impact her children nor does she seem to realize that they need her. Why couldn’t she serve others and raise her children, too, is a question that is never fully answered in the novel.I was very frustrated with, Elna, because I couldn’t relate to her just walking away from her family. I had to ask myself, would I have felt the same way if it were Cyril who had walked away instead? Are we harder on women who leave than we are men? Questions like these are left for the readers to decide and fill in the blanks. I don’t care for the ending of the novel. It has a full circle vibe that seems more contrived than believable--like one readers would find in a fairy tale. It’s not necessarily a flaw in the novel but more of this reader’s preference. If the architecture of the story is not a fairy tale in the beginning, I certainly don’t want it to change into one at the end for the sake of closure. I tried to see the glass in, The Dutch House, like Cinderella’s “glass slippers,” but that image didn’t hold because there was no Prince to be found in this story."
897,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59687979-ely,Rating 5 out of 5,"when the book is good, it’s hard to put down but your eyelids won the competition. That’s what I felt while I started this book yesterday and totally have my attention all night long. 4⭐️ for sureThis book told me the story from Danny’s perspective (the second child) of Conroy’s family. It was beautifully written especially mentioning the families, the past holding you down, the eagerness to become rich, and the spiritual awakening. How the author pours her words into sentences and retells this story based on Danny’s is something I couldn’t put a word for that appraisal. She did a great job on it because when I was starting this book, I am devoured by her words and couldn’t even mind anything around me. The storyline really went well with how the flow is going. And the book itself is divided into 3 chapters like 3 stages of life; (1)The beginning of our youth, (2)The stage of life we tried to find its meaning, and (3)The time when we could put the past in the past. I was immersed in how every chapter in this book has its own meaning to tell the readers on the moral of the story on their own. The stage of life Danny and Maeve have in this story tell the readers different perspectives of their own person. The Issues this book holds dear for me:➊ The stage of a person from poor — rich — poor, the Conroy families➋ The doomed of the Wealth, Andrea is a witch➌ Parent’s regression, Elna and Cyril’s doomed to their own children➍ Catholic cultures➎ The fear of ending up like the trees with the apples, Danny’s fear➏ The look of the Mirror, Maeve's relationship with Celeste➐ Making Peace for the sake of your own sanity, Maeve and Elna to the Dutch House➑ The Jealousy, Danny’s towards Maeve and Elna's relationship➒ The Spiritual Awakening, Elna’s spiritual calling and leaving her family behindIn the end, I am glad I picked this book and devour it only one day. Not only the writing is magnificent but also the storyline has its own meaning for each character written. This book tells you lots about families in any way you could imagine; from the doomed, the forgiveness, the struggle, and the love. While reading this book, I felt any emotions I had inside and burst into it immediately on certain parts. However, what I dislike about it is the backstories of Andrea and the reasons behind it, if it was intended to do it as a mystery. Please make it better rather than leave us clueless at all. Also, the things about the plot jumping from one present time to the past are hella confusing at first.I love this book and will recommend this to anyone who wants the feel of ”families.” I also love the meaning of each storyline inside the book. This book is beautifully written and I do want a physical copy soon."
898,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7356675-stephen,Rating 3 out of 5,"This isn't going to be a normal review for me. Because Ann Patchett stole this story from the life of my cousins, right down to the evil stepmother.Okay, I highly doubt that Patchett had any clue of my relatives' story--though they grew up only a few miles from the eponymous Dutch House. And I hesitate to call my aunt an evil stepmother. Though she did try to have my cousin thrown in prison for trying to claim his inheritance after my uncle died. So my review may be a little colored here. There are more differences than similarities, but there are lots of similarities.So here's the thing. Patchett is an amazing writer, she does a great job bringing characters to life, making you care about them. But what I appreciate here is that she also has, in the past (in some books more than others) grounded those characters in a plot that might be worth reading on its own. But such isn't the case here.And if I think about the characters in too much depth, I can't be too sympathetic. The children of the evil stepmother were kicked out of their house when the younger is still in high school, but also of their very rich life. Sure, the story isn't about their wealth, but then why did they have to be wealthy? And ultimately, why did they have to end up successful.Okay, the older, Maeve (aside--it just occurred to me that is not a name at all that would have been given to a child in the 40s) has gotten through college and gotten a job. If things had been different she might have gone to graduate school, gotten a better education and a job, but she's satisfied with her lot in life. (Or at least she insists she is--she's the type who wouldn't go to a doctor unless dragged, so maybe she just doesn't want to complain). The younger, Danny, though is doing what he loves, and what his father did, building a real estate empire, living as a landlord. Maybe his real estate empire isn't as big as his fathers, but he has more than enough that he can't complain.Just because he still had the privilege of having been rich, he ended up going to med school on a trust fund though he never planned to practice as a doctor. He had on the job training, so to speak, from his father on how to be a landlord.But they do long for the house they were kicked out of. As another character says ""At what point do you say to her, Okay, it was an awful childhood, it's a terrible thing to be rich and then not to be rich, but now everybody has to grow up?"" The character who asks speaks in part of out hypocrisy, but it's a perfectly reasonable question for the reader to ask. And even if longing for the house is about an idyllic past, not about the wealth, the wealth is still a problem.And then there's the gentrification. Danny's real estate empire, being centered in Harlem and Washington Heights, taking buildings in poor conditions and cleaning them up to earn rents can only have contributed to gentrification. And though gentrification isn't mentioned there, it is specifically mentioned in the house Danny and his family end up in. About the neighborhood he'd move into: ""The winds of gentrification were starting to shift towards the Upper West Side and I wanted to get ahead of them."" So he's making his money off of personal gumption and the destruction of existing culture. Good for him.This book isn't about the wealth, but it really should have dealt better with wealth, or maybe made the story about at least a somewhat less wealthy family. The points it was trying to make about family might have worked better if the characters had to struggle for a living. At all.Back to that stepmother. For a while, I was thinking that this is the most pedestrian story of an evil stepmother that I've ever heard. And, even comparing it to real life, it still is more pedestrian. I saw an interview with Patchett where she said she didn't fill out the stepmother's story because she wasn't able to write a villain--if she'd tried, the stepmother would have become sympathetic. I've never really sought the details of what happened after my uncle died, but if I were reading the book of it, I would want to know."
899,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64620666-murray,Rating 4 out of 5,"The story is centred on an ornate and beautiful house and the residents who unsuccessfully attempt to sustain contented family lives within it, as well as the staff bound up in their efforts. It’s a gentle, but intense read, which lovingly depicts a house built and furnished to be a unique haven, but where lives instead go off the rails in a major way. The book’s also about the high price women can pay if they decide to leave the domestic and family realm, or if they want it too much, or are flung from it too young, or if they are staff whose livelihoods depend on the goodwill of the families they serve. And it’s about attitudes to beautiful things - ranging from taking unthinking pleasure in them, to calculated covetousness. To a limited extent the book projects backwards in time from the main two sets of occupants, as well as forwards in a way that is ultimately hopeful. Patchett does a great job of writing a book that is insightful, while using a narrator (Danny) and several major characters who definitely aren’t. For example, in one small incident, it’s a complete surprise to Danny to discover that the two housemaids who have lovingly cared for him for years are in fact sisters. The other central male figure in the book - Danny’s father - clearly has a similar self-engrossed, unobservant nature. Despite this, father and son are not malicious, they are successes in the larger world, and they distractedly try to do their best during the limited times they are at home. But the book is focused on domestic life, and the characters whose actions have the biggest impact - not that it does any of them a whole lot of good - are three women: Maeve (Danny’s sister), Elna (his and Maeve’s mostly absent mother), and Andrea (Danny and Maeve’s stepmother). Like Danny and his dad, Elna and Andrea don’t have a high level of emotional intelligence - though it manifests in ways that are polar opposites. I liked this book a lot. For recognising how personal and family identity can be completely bound up and anchored in a house. And for showing how it can become a beautiful, overwhelming prison unless those within it can share it, and use it to help them connect with the larger world."

I've been following her ever since first finding out that she's the co-owner of Parnassus Bookstore in Nashville, and more recently from her blog that I check in with every few weeks. You can't help but love her when you read about all the author events that she organizes at the bookstore, or the wonderfully sweet interviews she does with authors who she visits with while they are in town. I mean, seriously, look at these pictures of her with author Emma Straub, who by the way is another wonderful author who co-owns a bookstore, (Books are Magic, don't you love it?), with her husband in Brooklyn. https://parnassusmusing.net/2020/05/0... Doesn't she look like the kindest, most huggable and lovely person ever? Don't you just want to hang out with her? I definitely want to hang out with her and her crew at Parnassus since they have shop dogs. Really, everyone gets to bring their dog to work. And from the pictures I've seen it looks like everyone who works there has a dog. That's my kind of job. Books, dogs, and probably coffee too. Definitely my kind of work environment. Anyway, the reason I'm saying all this is that, and I dislike even saying it, her writing for the most part I just find kind of meh. Her blog, wonderful. Her author chats and interviews, lovely. But for her fiction I'm sorry to say, I can't find much empathy or interest in most, but not all, of her characters. I've now read 9 of her books and I've given 3 stars to 6 of them. Oh boy, this is getting to be a long explanation, isn't it? So......this book. I took the advice of a friend and listened to it on audio read by Tom Hanks. He did a great job, but it really wasn't enough to make me enjoy the story. It took me a week and a half to get through it, which is a long time for me. Mostly I was bored and uninterested and kept looking to see how many more hours I still had to go before it was over. It just wasn't my kind of story. But check out her blog and Parnassus Bookstore. Both of those I can definitely recommend."

We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we're not seeing it as the people we were, we're seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.”― Ann Patchett, The Dutch HouseOur past might not define us, but it certainly influences us and it does influence how we see possibilities. Experiences shape who we are. Some people have been through extremely hard things and can’t escape their past. It may not be easy, but the past can be used to help us grow instead of hurt us. After all, the past is behind us.The Dutch House was a deserving finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for fiction. It tells the story of a brother and sister, Danny and Maeve Conroy, who grow up in an elaborate mansion in the suburbs of Philadelphia called the Dutch House. At the end of World War II, their father Cyril Conroy used a bit of luck to turn a real estate investment into a fortune. An emotionally distant man, Cyril buys the Dutch House, which is meant as a surprise for his wife, Elna. This purchase, meant to be a wonderful gift, leads to the unraveling of family. Troubled by this extravagant show of wealth, the mother abandons the family. Cyril remarries, but Danny and Maeve are exiled when their father dies suddenly.The story is told by Danny, as he and Maeve learn to count on one another. This unwavering bond both rescues them and frustrates their futures. The relationship between brother and sister is finally tested when they’re forced to confront individuals who abandoned them.― “And so I made the decision to change. It might seem like change was impossible, given my nature and my age, but I understood exactly what there was to lose. It was chemistry all over again. The point wasn’t whether or not I liked it. The point was it had to be done.”― Ann Patchett, The Dutch HouseThe Dutch House is a moving story that explores the place of family, loss, and the past. Don’t miss it.

And am I just reading it yeah sorry)To be completely honest I didn't feel very compelled to pick up this book and read it until recently when I couldn't decide what to read and remembered that this book has been sitting on my tbr stack for a while. This was a pleasant and enjoyable read, especially the 1/3 of the book. I really liked the retrospective style Patchett took on (similar to To Kill a Mockingbird). But I have to admit sometimes the time jumps back and forth confused me a little bit but I surprisingly found myself liking this retrospect. What I also liked was Patchett added a twist to the construction of Andrea being the 'evil stepmother'. She wasn't just a cardboard copy of an evil stepmother but she at least had some character construction which was refreshing to see. And some of the dialogue between Maeve and Danny was rather comical to my surprise. But I felt the plot got a little lost up to when Danny went to college. I kind of lost interest and I really felt bored. All the characters had or were moving forward with their lives and I just thought that it was just a really prolonged ending for most of the part. I also really hated Celeste. She was just that annoying character that was just...there. She just functioned as the wife who marries the main character and has his kids and there wasn't much development or construction of her either. Maeve and Danny's mother was also annoying with that humility, altruism and helping people no matter what even if they kicked your kids out of their house after their father died and stole their house and everything. That shit was annoying as fuck and she just annoyed me. The only thing that kept me going was Patchett's writing. Anyways, this was a nice read but I personally didn't feel a connection to it. The writing was quite beautiful and I really did like the retrospective. "
903,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5308813-janine,Rating 4 out of 5,"This was worth it just for Tom Hanks narrating the audiobook. I've had more than one discussion over the last few months about Anne Patchett, and how she is hit or miss for a lot of people. Generally, you either love her or you hate her. I think I'm one of the rare people who fall middle of the road with her. I loved Bel Canto when I read it, but just haven't really found much reason to go back to her over the years. The Dutch House seems like a book that most people love, and for good reason -- it's a great story. One of my favorites - character driven, centered around a fairly dysfunctional family. Danny is a great character to tell this story because of his unique role in the family - as the youngest, as the boy, as the one who doesn't remember his life with his mother as a part of it. It's partially this, and again, partially Tom Hanks narrating as Danny, that gives him this sense of calm and reason as he tells the story. Crazy things have happened to him and his sister Maeve - but somehow Danny takes it all in stride, biding his time until....well, I don't know what exactly. I loved Danny's relationship with Maeve -the thing that helped him weather a whole lot of crazy. Their relationship was interesting. Close, and yet Maeve in particular seemed to put up some walls when it came to Danny. She could never allow herself to seem too vulnerable or like she wasn't in charge. She was all he had, after all. The family dynamics at play in the story are so interesting - the way the people that surround Danny and Maeve come into their lives, float out of them, and often somehow find their way back into their orbit. And then, of course, there's the Dutch House itself. The all glass piece of art that puts anyone inside of it on display for the world to see. So much of Danny's life revolves around that house, even though so little of his life was spent living in it. This is a fascinating character study, and incredibly well done. "

Labai džiaugiuosi, kad lietuviškam leidimui paliktas originalusis variantas. Kadangi tai ne pirmasis Ann Pattchett skaitytas kūrinys, galėjau numanyti, kas manęs laukia. Nežinau, ar pagrindinis veikėjai čia Konrojų šeima, ar vis gi Olandų namas. Sirilas Konrojus - talentingas verslininkas praturtėjęs atsitiktinai nuperka Olandų namą Filadelfijos priemiestyje su visais prieš tai gyvenusios šeimos daiktais (kurie taip pat buvo labai turtingi, tačiau karas paliko be paveldėtojų). Deja, bet šeimai tai laimės neatnešė - Sirilo žmona Elna negalėjo gyventi name, apsuta prabangos, todėl išvyko ir paliko savo du vaikus. Meivė ir Danis vaizduojami jau suaugę, vis grįžtantys prie namo, kuris jiems nebepriklauso, - tik žvelgdami į jį gali dalytis mintimis.Kaip ten bebūtų, žavėjausi Meivės ir Danio ryšiu. Meivė tapo broliui lyg mama, nes tėtis suko verslą, o vaikų priežiūra buvo palikta samdytoms darbuotojoms. Vis dėl to Meivę labiau veikė Namas - ji gyvendama kaimynystėje ten vis sugrįždavo... Beje, tik perskaitę romaną sužinosite, kodėl būtent toks yra jo viršelis.""Olandų namas"" man labiau patiko nei ""Vieningieji"", kur buvo tikra makalynė giminaičių. Pati istorija kažkaip įsiurbė, lyg realybės šou - buvo įdomu stebėti, kaip keičiasi Konrojų gyvenimai. Vis dėl to, intrigos buvo per maža, kad išlaikyti dėmesį...

The first thing he buys is the Dutch House, a huge estate outside of Philadelphia, which he presents to his young wife as a surprise. This act is the beginning of the end of his family’s life, so to speak.The story covers five decades and is told by Cyril’s son, Danny. He and his sister Maeve are eventually exiled from the house and left to fend for themselves after Cyril’s untimely death. Abandoned by their mother years earlier, they are left orphaned and it is only through Maeve’s determination and love for her brother that they scramble and succeed... but always with the Dutch House looming in their heads. Despite their accomplishments, they are never quite able to escape its clutches. The Dutch House is arguably a character itself; one that impacts every move of the rest of their lives.This is a story of family, loyalty, forgiveness and love. It was a tad hard to believe in places (specifically, some of the characters’ reactions in the latter half of the book), but I was enjoying the story enough to overlook that. Readers who enjoy slow-burning family dramas (with a good share of lighter moments) will like this one."

The connection all the characters try to make by holding the house central to their story, captives of their past, trying to build a life while life is taken from beneath their solid feet makes this an engrossing read.

Other books are like a slow ride down a lazy river, you take in every nuance along the way. This lovely book is the latter. I devoured it slowly and enjoyed every single morsel. I absolutely adore this book and I can’t stop thinking about it. Of course, the house is a big part of it. A house so big and loaded with things from the previous tenants that some people wanted nothing to do with it. Some people would give anything and anyone up to have it. The descriptions of it put you right inside it. I would love to walk through it. The heart of this novel though is really the love between a brother and a sister who were everything to each other. A sister who would do anything for her brother and a brother who would give up anything for his sister. There are so many emotions on display throughout the story. The heartbreak is heartbreaking. The disappointments, the triumphs, the struggles are all so real. It was hard to say goodbye to these characters and I love how it completely went full circle. One of the loveliest books I have read in quite a while.Thanks to Netgalley and HarperCollins for this wonderful book. The review is my humble opinion."
908,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2058617-cindy,Rating 4 out of 5,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️This is just a really good story. I feel like it was not just written....it was crafted. It is absolutely “character-driven” (a favorite phrase of one of my daughters), and the characters are very real and relatable. It is told by Danny, who, with his older sister Maeve, struggled with great emotional loss and then great physical loss. Their father bought The Dutch House as a surprise for their mother. And she hated it. It was too grand for her humble tastes. So she ended up leaving. Danny was so small he doesn’t remember her. And a few years later, their dad remarries a woman who DOES love the house—to the exclusion of all else, it seems. She ends up banishing her stepchildren from it. This pivotal event impacts Danny and Maeve for decades to come. Through school, work and relationships, the siblings cling to each other and can’t seem to let go of the harm or the home. They don’t set foot in it, but they frequently park outside on the street to discuss the past and what could have been. There is a lot of irony in how their lives evolve. I won’t say more about that because it would require clicking on the “spoiler” tab, but it is part of what makes this book so intriguing. You should also know that the story flashes back and forth in time, even within chapters, but it is never confusing. The flow is so well crafted that it is easy to slide from the past to the present, and back again, without becoming confused. An impressive novel."

Poznajemy życie dwójki rodzeństwa z bogatego domu, tytułowego domu Holendrów i ich najbliżej rodziny. Szczególnie podobał mi się motyw ich „porzucenia” przez matkę. Autorka zwróciła bowiem uwagę na to, że być może czytelnik nie byłby tak oburzony postawą rodzica, gdyby w jej miejscu postawić ojca. Ustami Maueve mówi, że świat jest pełen wybitnych mężczyzn, którzy porzucili swoje rodziny by w całości poświecić się jednemu celowi. Podobało mi się również to, że tytułowy dom Holendrów pełni w opowieści jakby rolę oddzielnego bohatera - jest przez członków rodziny uwielbiany, albo nienawidzony. Jego pojawienie się pod sam koniec książki twórz klamrę podsumowująca cały system rodzinny. Jeśli chodzi o podejście systemowe to ciekawym zabiegiem było napisane części historii głównego bohatera Danniego na wzór błędów własnego ojca.

910,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35349691-trish-parkinson,Rating 2 out of 5,"The Dutch House is an interesting type of novel.We follow the strong bond that two siblings have throughout their lifetime drawing them back to the house they knew as a child. This novel has a promising premise. Many classics have taken on the idea of a house that drives the narration. One example is Wuthering Heights, granted I didn’t really enjoy that novel either. This book plays it entirely too safe. Patchett works hard to include long expository sections about characters, however, it doesn’t seem like any of these characters are completely whole. I do not feel any sort of connection to the characters, and some of them seem so outlandish and comical that I cannot begin to understand their motivations. If we were veering onto theatrical that would be completely fine, but this book does not take risks so we are left with an odd bag of characters and quite normal, happenstance situations. This book lacks an “it” factor. Nothing here made me want to finish reading it because on all accounts, nothing of interest truly happens"
911,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13555414-olga-miret,Rating 5 out of 5,"Thanks to NetGalley and to Bloomsbury Publishing for providing me an ARC copy of this book that I freely chose to review.I’ve heard of Ann Patchett but hadn’t read any of her novels until now, and this seemed like an excellent opportunity to get started. And I really liked the book cover and was intrigued by the title as well. Having read this novel, I’m sure it won’t be the last of the author’s books I read.Although most reviews are positive, some readers who are familiar with her previous novels felt disappointed, while others loved it as much, if not more, as her previous work. As I said, I have nothing to compare it with, but I enjoyed it. I loved the characters (most of all), I loved the setting, and the writing, that can be lyrical, touching, and humorous in turns. This is the story of a family, or, to be precise, of two siblings and the people they meet along the way. Maeve and Danny become a family-unit through unfortunate (and at times bizarre) circumstances. Their mother leaves when Danny, the younger of the two, is only three years old, and Maeve becomes his sister/mother/life coach/career advisor and many more things. Their father, Cyril, a real estate magnate, is consumed by his business and never explains much, either about his background, their mother, or the house, the Dutch House of the title. When he marries Andrea, who has two daughters of her own, things change, and when he dies, things take an even more dramatic turn. The story, such as it is, is narrated in the first person by Danny, who claims to have intended to tell the story of his sister (a rather extraordinary individual I’d love to meet in real life), but he realised that this could not be done in isolation from his own and from that of many others who had also played parts in the events they might not have been fully aware of at the time. Although there is an overall chronological order to the novel, Danny’s memory sometimes circles back and forth to moments or events that are related or linked, at least in his mind, to what he is thinking or talking about at the time. He explores the memories around the Dutch House (a seemingly mysterious place although things don’t go in the direction readers might expect), and how the different people seem to have contrasting versions of what went on and totally different feelings about it as well. Was their mother a saint, or a heartless woman who abandoned her children in her eagerness to help unknown others? Was Andrea a greedy woman (the wicked stepmother of fairy tales) who married their father for his money and then threw them out? Or did she truly love him and resented them for their connection to him? Was Maeve domineering and manipulative or selfless and generous? Why didn’t Danny’s wife, Celeste, and his sister get on? What power did the Dutch House have over its inhabitants?As I have already mentioned, I loved the characters. Although we don’t get to know all of them completely (this is the story Danny is telling, and at times he can be remarkably lacking in insight and even curiosity), that is part of the charm of the story. This would make a great novel for book clubs, as there is much to discuss, and I am sure different readers will have totally different opinions on the characters and their possible motives and/or justifications. Interpretations are left open, and although there is an end (yes, a happy ending of sorts), the ending does not necessarily provide an explanation for everything that happens, at least not a definitive one. As is the case in real life, people are unknowable, and even those we think we know best can surprise us at times.I also loved the house. The similarities to a fairy tale are mentioned in the description and in many of the reviews, and perhaps because we first see the house from the perspective of a little boy, there is something magical about it. There are secret drawers, paintings of previous owners, gold leaf decorations, hidden storage places, and the house seems to hold an ongoing influence over those who’ve ever lived or worked there. I would love to visit it, and the combination of grand mansion and some of the characteristics of a gothic castle work well and give it a strong personality, although it might not live up to everybody’s expectations.I have read some of the negative comments, and I do understand them and don’t necessarily disagree with the points they make, although I feel they don’t detract from the novel. Some people note that there is no plot or story behind it and complain that it is slow. This is a family saga, and as such there is no conventional plot or a great revelation (there are quite a few secrets and misunderstandings that get cleared out, but that is not the same) at the end. Because this is a book about memory, family life, growing older, and forgiveness, it is not a straightforward narration or a page-turner where the main point is to keep the action moving. Life happens at its own pace; there are funny moments, sad moments, enlightening moments, inspiring ones, and disappointments as well. The writing is compelling, but people who love stories full of action and a quick pace should not attempt this novel, unless they are willing to try something different. Some readers also complain that some of the storylines are unrealistic… Well, this is a novel, and I’ve read some that required a much higher degree of suspension of disbelief than this one, but I am sure realism is not what the author was after.I loved this novel and would recommend it to readers who appreciate a focus on character, beautiful writing, and some touches of magic and are fond of the adult fairy-tale. As usual, I recommend readers who aren’t sure if they’d enjoy it or not, to try a book sample and see how they feel. I look forward to reading more of Patchett’s stories in the future. I have the feeling that they won’t disappoint."

It started off very slowly for me, but I knew to hang in there as her novels are always worth the wait! Family dramas are always interesting--especially the messy, complicated ones that test the characters and their devotion to loved ones. The sentence that defined it for me was this: ""Our childhood was a fire. There had been four children in the house and only two of them had gotten out."" Danny and Maeve (brother and sister) are tested by unusual circumstances; their mother leaves unexpectedly when they are young, and their father marries Andrea, the stepmother from Hell who doesn't bond with them at all and brings her two young daughters into the home to ""replace"" them. And so it goes....Years later Danny and Maeve are still dealing with the repercussions of their mother's absence while attempting to live their own adult lives. It certainly makes you question your own relationships with loved ones and realize that redemption is possible and family bonds are imperative, or as Moss Hart believes, that ""the umbilical cord is made of piano wire."""
913,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5851767-thatbookgal,Rating 4 out of 5,"Fundamentally, The Dutch House is about siblings Danny and Maeve, and how they cope when everything they love is taken away from them. Their bond was beautiful, although it had a great deal of flaws, it was heartwarming to see a brother and sister genuinely care about each other. Their story wasn’t always an easy one, but the relationship between the two took the edge off a little.At certain points in the novel my heart ached for Danny, who was something of a lost boy. Even into adulthood he never really seemed able to stand up for himself. Yet Patchett kept the sense of realism alive but giving him some major flaws, he was undoubtably selfish and often walked the same path as his father before him. Maeve similarly was headstrong and intelligent, but it came with a side of extreme stubbornness and a refusal to look at the bigger picture.Although at times emotional, this was certainly one of those gentle tales that drops you into the lives of one family across several decades. Plot wise, aside from the odd moment or two, nothing overly dramatic happens. It really added to the sense of it being historical facts, as opposed to a work of fiction. Patchett’s style of writing is just perfect for this sort of novel, it’s so easy to read.If you like your books full of dramatic plot twists and tons of action, The Dutch House is no doubt not for you. But if you want a gentle tale of family trauma and recovery, then I certainly recommend giving it a go. Tom Hanks also narrates the audiobook, and I can’t think of someone with a better suited voice for this tale! If you enjoy audiobooks definitely check that out!!"

The book itself it wonderful. It is a family saga, following the Conroy family throughout their lives as they moved into ""The Dutch House"" while Danny and his older sister, Maeve were still children and into adulthood. The character develop was terrific and the interaction between the characters was so realistically portrayed.I loved this family but even more so with the choice of Tom Hanks as the narrator as Danny. He was the perfect choice.The spell that The Dutch House held over the lives of this family was extraordinary. Over a fifty year life-span, Maeve and Danny attach so much meaning to the icon of this house that it takes on a life of its own. Even when they move into adulthood and the life of careers and family and children, they are still focused on the house where they occasionally return to sit and observe it.This is an amazing book that is highly recommended. #TheDutchHouse #AnnPatchett #Harper"
915,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12652354-carolw,Rating 4 out of 5,I assumed going into this book that it was about a house because of the title but I did not know it was a story about the effects of this house on the people that lived and worked in the house. While reading this book I thought about the house that I grew up in and if it had lasting effects on me. Of course my house didn’t have a name or wasn’t as grand as The Dutch House. I didn’t have traumatic things happen to me in my house like Maeve and Danny so I have very fond memories of my house. But like Maeve and Danny I do go by my house and park on the street when I am back in my hometown. It is good to remember the happiness of a house too. I loved all the characters in this book and the stories about all of them. There were things in the book that bothered me and I wonder if they would be true reactions to situations in real life but overall I really enjoyed the book. Listening to Tom Hanks read the book was a huge plus for me too!!!!

And I'm sad all the way down to my bones.That said, I really liked this book. This was my first time reading Ann Patchett, and it's definitely made me want to pick up another work of hers right away. There's this sparse way she writes her prose that I came to appreciate as she detailed the Conroy's sprawling saga. Sharp and cutting, right to the heart of everything--the places, the people, and everything that happened to them.Learning the fate of the Dutch House and its inhabitants should have felt slow, taking place over so many years and with so much rage-inducing heartbreak. But I read it in two sittings, two quick stabs that hurt but not as much as they could have if delivered by a less skilled writer.I'll hold the painting of Maeve and her red coat in my mind for a very long time. I'll carry her and her story with me, just like Danny. "

However, growing up with the siblings in the mid-section of the book grew pretty tedious for me. Maeve is a more interesting character, and Maeve and Danny's co-dependence as a result of being the only thing the other has in the world is compelling, but the story is told through Danny's eyes and I just didn't care enough about him as a character to not get frustrated by the rambling nature of his career and family life. I liked some of the plot developments later on, but I was too impatient by that point to fully appreciate them. Not even being set 30 minutes down the road from where I grew up could save this one for me."

Pochłaniająca i zajmująca saga rodzinna. Gęsta i gorzka jak dym tytoniowy. Cierpka jak czarna herbata. Sentymentalna jak pożółkłe polaroidy. Klimatyczna jak stary dom. Wyraźnie zarysowane postaci, zjawiskowa sceneria i ciekawa historia. Atmosfera wielkiego, tajemniczego i przytłaczającego budynku. Oczy spoglądające z portretów. Ciepły uścisk opiekunki. Dwójka dzieci. Wersy przesiąknięte żalem i rozczarowaniem.„Dom Holendrów” to jednak przed wszystkim studium relacji międzyludzkich. Relacji małżonków. Dzieci z matką. Dzieci z ojcem. Macochy. Rodzeństwa. Przyjaciół. Ann Patchett napisała powieść o ludziach. O pustym domu. O pustych sercach i niewypowiedzianych słowach. O znaczeniu przeszłości. Po odłożeniu książki czuje ciagle jej obecność. Słowa powieści osadziły się na mojej skórze. Zostaną ze mną jeszcze przez jakiś czas. Bardzo polecam. "

Just a satisfyingly intimate portrait of a complex family. Beautiful evocative writing. Fascinating characters. The story is told by Danny, about life with his beloved and amazing sister, and the family who fail them. The male voice can tend to be more detached (I found it to be a detached style in this story) and honestly he was flawed in many ways (the way he talked about his wife, ugh) but he grew and evolved too. This is a story about family that fails, making peace, gaining perspective. What can be changed, what needs to be let go. It’s gentle and emotional, I felt tender and enraged at different parts, and near tears at the end. It’s so good to be in the hands of an excellent writer, when you can just relax and let a story unfold. What all good novels should do! I really want to visit the Dutch house haha. This is a great read for sure. Look forward to getting my hands on some more. "

Ir dabar rašau „nerandu“, nes nė nenutuokiu, ką pavyks pasakyti. Ir čia ne apie tai, kad istorija man nepatiko. O ne, Ann Patchett aš labai myliu – skaičiau ir kitas jos knygas: „Vieningieji“, o ypatingai „Nuostaba“ man prilygsta stebuklui. Šių istorijų niekaip nepavadintum banaliomis ar nuobodžiomis. Jos kažkokios „kitokios“, ir tas kitoniškumas man labai artimas.Taip ir ši, prabėgom skaityt nepavyks. Tekstas nelengvas, tačiau gražus, o kai tai nutinka, visada žiūriu, kieno vertimas.

922,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/95055-allison,Rating 5 out of 5,"Ann Patchett is obviously a master of fiction, and she continues to prove as much with The Dutch House. Her writing and characters are just so lyrical and pitch-perfect, which was enough for me with this book. The only thing that I didn't quite get - and I post this only because I'm curious if other readers saw something that I missed - was the resentments between Maeve and Danny's wife (leaving out her name, so no spoiler). It was obviously a present theme and thread but...I didn't really see it, and I wonder if that tension had been more clear (for me), if the undercurrent of the book would have been more propulsive.That said, I truly couldn't put it down and thought about the characters throughout the day when I wasn't reading. That's the mark of a great read."
923,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1561203-shelli,Rating 4 out of 5,"This story started a little slow for me. I kept going back to look at the cover or blurb, because for me, it was quite different than I was expecting. Once I got caught up in it though, it really was engaging. The story is narrated by Danny who tells us about living in the Dutch House with his older sister Maeve and their parents, and the hired help, until everything starts to unravel. This part from the blurb most closely describes the story for me....""Despite every outward sign of success, Danny and Maeve are only truly comfortable when they’re together. Throughout their lives, they return to the well-worn story of what they’ve lost with humor and rage."" I really liked these two characters and the bond they shared. I kind of thought ""the house"" might have been a bit more prominent in the story. While it is referred to often, we spend a lot of time outside of the house.It has a cast of very interesting characters. Sandy and Jocelyn, cooks and housekeepers, are wonderful secondary characters and I enjoyed the scenes with them. Cyril, Elna and Andrea ""the parents/step-parent are people who were impossible to relate to but interesting to read about. I was glad this was a bookclub read as we had many things to discuss. I read ""Commonwealth"" by this author and loved it and was not disappointed in this one. She has a way of writing characters that seem so real to me. Even if I don't like them, I believe them. The cover of this book is also beautiful. A great start to the new year of reading."

You know that an author has done her job perfectly when you feel all the losses and regrets at the end so completely that it’s as if you were a part of it all, as if you were there, as if they are your own. That is how this book makes me feel. What a journey with this family but really with Maeve and Danny. The building of their characters and their relationship was so well done - I feel like I know them so well and they mean so much to each other and now to me. I’m sad that I won’t get to know them anymore now that the book is done. Ann Patchett is one of my favorite authors and her ability to quietly weave you into her characters lives in such a deep way is, for me, mesmerizing. New stories, new locales, new characters and still that quiet detail that holds you and won’t let you go. Wonderful book. Many tears at the end - happy, sad, thoughtful, meaningful. This will stay with me for awhile. "

Narrated by Danny, the son of a man who bought a magnificent house without consulting his wife, it tells the tale of the family he grew up with ( his sister, step sisters and step Mom) and continues to tell of his own family which grew with his children and the reappearance of his biological Mom. It speaks of relationships, dysfunctional families, friendship and loyalties, love and loss with the constant connection of the Dutch house. A wonderful story to lose yourself in for a few days."

I devoured The Dutch House and loved getting lost in the story of Danny and Maeve, siblings who are haunted by the loss of their parents, their massive childhood home, and their understanding of the past.

A gorgeous mansion, an absent mother, a distant father, a wicked step mother, and two siblings - Maeve and the much younger Danny - who are left to cling to one another and form an inseparable, lifetime bond. Danny is the narrator but the brilliant, brave Maeve is both the heroine and the tragic figure. Danny tells their story through the filter of his memories: ""But we overlay the present onto the past, we look back through the lens of what we know now, so we're not seeing it as the people we were, we're seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered."" This is a character-driven, relationship novel that is very heartfelt and beautifully written. It goes on my list of favorites."

I didn't enjoy the cover, but you know the saying. The name seemed dull. But the story kept me engaged, I wanted to follow the story, I earned to know where it will lead. Though simple and without extra action, I found myself enjoying it very much. And the levels of relationship here.. Anger, forgiveness, loyalty, determination..

As it was, I had the opportunity to listen to Tom Hanks read it to me. Can I just say: I want Mr Hanks to read all my books now. His tone, his voice, his inflections were perfect in characterizing Danny, our narrator for this story of his sister Maeve. Of course, it all starts at the Dutch House. Danny, younger than Maeve by 7 years, is our narrator, but this really is about the journey of Maeve, told from his point of view. Of course, their stories are intertwined and the Dutch House is there, in the background. The events that occur there, the people who have inhabited the house affect all our characters in one way or another. This is a story, though, of what is important in life, what gives our lives meaning, how we measure our success, failure - the ebb and flow of life and how it gathers us all in to it's bosom, regardless of our roles in one another's lives. The Dutch House really touched my heart. It's lesson is subtle, so understated. It's really about loving each other, being kind, and giving more consideration to how life can toss and turn us. We can only ever control our own outcomes. And that is enough. Has to be enough, in the end. "

I loved that the Dutch house was almost a character in its own right. I loved the relationship between Danny and Maeve and the way they stuck together throughout adulthood. I loved the warmth of having Sandy, Jocelyn and Fluffy included in the Conroy's lives. And, of course, I loved all the references to Philadelphia. "

I finished this book feeling both frustrated and empathetic, and to me, conflicting emotions / opinions are a sign of a story well concocted and time well spent."

Now under the care of a loving couple after going through years of neglect, the house is one I returned to as would my two sisters over the years. One sister passed away on Valentine's day but glad she had a chance to enjoy a signed copy of this novel for Xmas. Naturally, I bought a copy for both of them and Ann was kind enough to endorse my copy with birthday wishes so it is her thoughtfulness that prompts me to view her kindly and follow her publications so closely. I also have to love Ann and her business partner, who, after Borders and Barnes&Noble bailed out of Nashville as it was ""not profitable enough"" opened Parnassus Books, doing very well and one of my favorite stores - 999 miles from my house, been there, bought stuff, got the T-shirt.

Now, about the book itself: this is my second Ann Patchett and while it had similar themes to Commonwealth, in the sense that it’s also a family drama, Dutch House was much better. I didn’t find Danny to be as annoying as some of the other reviewers, though perhaps I’m a general apologist for somewhat oblivious, straight, white, rich guys, so it makes sense for me to feel less offended by the narrator. It’s hard for me to pinpoint exactly what I loved about this book, only that I guess my achille’s heel in terms of genre are epic family dramas and this counts as one, more or less. You watch lives play out over decades and some choices are infuriating while others are endearing. Only minor complaint is that perhaps the ending is a little too neat, but the closure I felt from it was so satisfying, it didn’t take away from the overall experience."

Set over the course of five decades, The Dutch House is a dark fairy tale about Danny and Maeve Conroy who cannot overcome their past. The book made me feel so cosy. It's like reading in a beautiful old Dutch House. The portrait on the cover of this book has its plot in the story. To be honest I fell in love with this beautiful portrait. The storyline is very smooth and intense at the earlier stage. I love reading the part where Maeve look after Danny. A sister's endless love and responsibility towards her brother. She always ensures that Danny gets the best education and life assurance. It was quite an emotional struggling to be in character and get through together with them during their difficult time. I admit I had my tears running down my cheek while reading the almost end part of the book. Such a beautiful family saga to be read. A very exciting improvised version of a fairytale. Ann Patchett and The Dutch House deserve five stars rating from me.This review is from my point of view. We may have different opinions. Feel free to share if there is any."

I read it within 24 hours of receiving it because I love Ann Patchett so much. I predict this will not be one of the most popular of her books. There's no truly compelling plot, but the characters are very interesting, and their issues kept me engaged from start to finish. I appreciated some important insights--and no doubt I will write more when I have had a day or two to think about the book some more. It's--of course--beautifully and masterfully written. It's just not Belle Canto, nor is it State of Wonder. I just need to think about whether that's, in the end, perfectly okay."

988,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/787357-jennifer-s-brown,No Rating,"I always seem to be reluctant to read books by Patchett, and then when I do, I'm floored by how good they are. I listened to the audiobook of this, and it's narrated by Tom Hanks. While he is, of course, an excellent reader, his voice is too familiar to me, so instead of picturing the narrator, Danny, I was picturing Tom Hanks.Danny and his older sister Maeve grew up at the Dutch House, a house purchased by their father, Cyril, as a surprise for their mother. Yet their mother leaves them and the father marries a woman, Andrea, who is obsessed with the house. She brings her two children to live there and proceeds to take over. When Cyril dies, Maeve is an adult and Danny is 15, yet Andrea kicks Danny out of the house.The book spans decades, as we learn about Danny as a baby all the way through to his own children growing. The Dutch House is at the center of everything, even when it isn't. It's a tremendous story of sibling love and family dynamics. I confess, at a sad moment, I got teary, which was a little awkward because I was walking the dog. A stunning book."

Every character is drawn with a lot of depth and dimension. I liked the way the story unfolded with this breadcrumb trail throughout. Slight issue with the pacing, there were some dull moments.

If she used that strategy to write this novel, she must have truly known these characters like old family friends.

This is a character driven novel with such lovely writing. I think it's good to know that coming in and choose to just dive in and let yourself be absorbed in this book.This is Danny's story - and especially the story of his relationship with his sister Maeve. I listened to the incredible audiobook read by Tom Hanks and felt it was the perfect way to take it in. It really felt like listening to someone share his history - and in that way, I also loved the way Patchett moved through time. It isn't strictly chronological - but if I asked you to tell me about your life, you also probably wouldn't tell it chronologically - you might start that way, but something would remind you of a major moment at a different time and it would take you there. And in this way, we wind back and forth through Danny's life. This book is about Danny and Maeve. It's about our relationships with our siblings. It's about the ways our parents' presence (and absence) shape us. It's about a beautiful old house in the Philadelphia suburbs. It's about the small choices we make and their consequences on our lives. It is all of this - and it is also so much more than this. Thank you very much to Harper for the free copy to read and I purchased the audiobook."
1001,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34293771-laura,Rating 1 out of 5,"I really have to lower the rating from 2 to 1 star. It is yet another novel about a house and this is during a time when people cannot leave their house. I honestly don’t know why this book is being marketed as a fairy tale, because it lacks so much in imagination and story to even be called a fairy tale. A fairy tale would be much more imaginative and exciting than a story about miserable wealthy people. Maeve and Danny are siblings. Danny, the narrator, is the most insufferable and annoying character I have ever come across. All he does is whine and complain about his privileged life and he is so passive that he lets his sister Maeve decide everything for him. He is also unappreciative and oblivious. He is also very boring and he whines about how he doesn’t want to become a doctor, yet he has an unexplained interest in buildings and buying out homes for reasons that are not very insightful or deep. Cyril, their father, brought the mansion called The Dutch House for his family. Cyril is probably the only character that makes any sense. Elna his first wife hates The Dutch House so much that she abandons her children to “help the poor” in India. Then Cyril meets Andrea, a widow with two children of her own. That’s all the reader knows about Andrea. Maeve and Danny do not like her because they find her “too controlling .” I didn’t find Andrea’s bad behavior that convincing and if the author gave us more information about her it would give a lot more insight into her character and into what motivates her. Being obsessed with a house isn’t enough. I would like to know more about her past. Cyril dies seven years later and Andrea decides to kick Danny and Maeve out.Also, I thought Maeve wasn’t a very well-developed character and I didn’t connect to her at all. She grew more and more unlikeable as she became more spiteful towards Andrea and worked the same job her whole life. I thought the author put too much emphasis on the fact that Maeve has beautiful black hair, beautiful posture, and diabetes. Those aren’t interesting character traits. There are worse things than what Andrea has done. She never physically abused Maeve and Danny or her own children, and it shows how formulaic this book is. I thought that Ann Patchett was very mean to Andrea, and Elna is arguably much worse because Andrea never abandoned her own children. This author seems oblivious to the lives of working people like Sandy and Jocelyn. I really didn’t like Maeve especially when she complained about having her room get taken away when she already had an apartment of her own, so I couldn’t understand exactly what she was complaining about. I don’t understand the connection to material things. It seems like Maeve and Danny are connected to only the material things in the Dutch House but I don’t understand why. It is also really superficial because Cyril is the one who worked hard to buy that house and I don’t understand the obsession with the house. Instead of getting a lawyer to use a trust fund so that Danny could go to Columbia for free and also go to medical school for free to get revenge on Andrea so her children had no money for education, Maeve and Danny should have gotten a therapist if they were so upset. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. Danny constantly whines about medical school despite the fact that he’s good at it and he goes for free. He meets Celeste who becomes his wife, and he complains about her too. I really did not like the portrayal of female characters. I think Celeste was justified in thinking that Maeve and Danny’s relationship was strange, because Danny is passive and he has no direction in his own life. I like reading about men who can take action and can make their own life decisions, not men who need their sister to decide everything for them. Ann Patchett cannot write from a man’s point of view and it really shows when he constantly complains about Celeste and is so clueless to all that she does for him. I never understood Maeve’s resentment towards Celeste. It really bothered me when Danny said that she was not distractingly pretty. Maeve was just really rotten and spiteful.It was unbelievable when Elna came back and how the children forgave her so easily after all the pain she caused her family. Other readers on here are bothered by the “hallmark” ending and I completely agree. It was just a very unrealistic novel and reading about these kinds of people reminds me a little bit about the Trump family, and I do not want to think about them at all. It’s a novel about over privileged people and it is an unimaginative poorly developed story"

1007,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61197974-the-escapist-reader,Rating 3 out of 5,"3 out of 5 starsI tend to dislike family dramas that include ""evil"" step-parents and to be honest the dynamic described in the book is an overused plot-line, but the book wasn't too bad for it.We are following two siblings through their childhood and adult years in a non-linear fashion. The story is told through the perspective of Danny, the boy, who idolizes his sister, Maeve, and after a certain point comes to view her as a parent figure, especially after their father's death with whom they'd had a withdrawn relationship. Amidst the events taking place in their lives, the Dutch House looms through the years as a reminder of their lost childhood, a place they cannot enter any more and a symbol of all their regrets and resentments.The writing style was engaging and didn't drag, but there are some passages that read as ""fake-deep"" (imo!); for that I am subtracting a star. Final verdict: not too shabby, maybe a little overhyped.Happy reading!"

1009,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/165114-leah-williams,Rating 5 out of 5,"I wanted to read this book again immediately upon finishing it. As it was, I tore through it in two days of frantic, impassioned reading. It surfaced many emotions and even now is difficult to write about with objectivity.Patchett's writing is lucid, arresting, and subtle. But the real, lingering pleasure of this novel is its thematic richness. It's a story about the tragedy of unfulfilled potential with a particular focus on the lives of women. We're challenged by the female characters to see past our facile morality judgments (one mother leaves her children in service of a greater calling, while the narrator's wife's ambition is sublimated to her obsession with her husband's occupation.) The narrator himself, much though he loves his sister and his wife, struggles to see them on their own terms. It's a universal failing but one with particular poignancy in our times as society reckons with the ambition, intelligence, and talent of women which for so long has been denigrated or made invisible.The synopsis of the book describes it as a fairy tale and for all of its incisive realism it does have a feel of the mythic. Home and family of origin are mythic subjects to us all, and as the narrator reflects on his extraordinary and ordinary circumstances it allows us to view and assimilate our experiences of family and home.Like all of my favorite fairy tales the novel has a sweet ending but one that feels hard-earned and not untinged with bitterness. I held my own young daughter (also named Maeve..!) tight afterward. I'm looking forward to re-reading this exquisite book again soon."

I have never read a Patchett book before - I’ve wanted to for a long time, but I am glad this one was what I chose to read of hers first. I love stories about the complexities of families, and how we all oddly long for things and places that we can’t quite explain. And how the objects and times of our lives can become things we simultaneously hate and love and resent and admire and yet don’t understand why they affect us. "

I think the perfect example is my love for Normal People by Sally Rooney (and conversation with friends. Review coming soon!). My brother listened to parts of the dutch house and found it ‘boring’ but I was hooked. Just something to keep in mind if you’re considering picking up this book!Spanning five decades, we follow siblings Danny and Maeve as they move in and out of the Dutch house but could never really emotionally part from the house and all their memories there. The Dutch house is more than a house. It’s hope, love, pain, anger, grief, forgiveness encapsulated in the three-story elkins park home on vanhoebeek street. - My heart was attached to Danny and Maeve from the very beginning to the end. They endured so much over the years and though important people came in and out of their lives, they were still each other’s rock. Tbh reminded me a lot of my relationship with my own brother. - Major bonus points from me for the type 1 diabetes cameo. I honestly screamed with excitement. - Ann Patchett’s characters had so much life and and complexity to them. "

This is a of Maeve and the house she was brought up in. It is told by her younger brother, a complex character who it is difficult to empathise with. Maeve herself is equally complex and the story flows around the other key character, the house, gradually revealing the background to their lives. The writing and the storytelling dovetail to produce a captivating read."

I mean, maybe it was just because Tom Hanks did the Audible, but he continually made the narrator sound like he was deeply annoyed and it made me deeply annoyed.But I liked it. I have complex feelings about it I think. It bothered me that every female character had either a pretentious or hyper-feminine name (Maeve? Celeste? Fluffy????!!?) but the choices were so blatant that I can only assume they were intentional. I must also assume that the lack of depth and complexity in Danny's understanding of the women in his life was also intentional. As a woman listening to a book narrated by a fictional man but written by a real woman I'm not sure of the point she was trying to make, but somehow I'm more annoyed by men more than ever."

1026,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17082415-lily,Rating 2 out of 5,"1.5 stars // Given The Dutch House was a Pulitzer Prize finalist and Ann Patchett's status as a prolific writer, my expectations for this novel were high. Although I enjoyed the writing, which felt similar to the Dutch House itself - sturdy and simple while at the same time stylish and ornate - the plot and characters were uninteresting at best. Besides Maeve, who was in my opinion the most well-developed and only redeeming character, the other characters, including Danny himself, seemed to be extensions of generic cardboard cutouts. The unoriginality of a mystery runaway mother, absent and cold father, nasty step-mother, and vapid and devoted wife made it boring and difficult to get through the novel. The motivations behind many of the characters' decisions were also left unexplained or grazed over, leaving me confused and annoyed. By the end, I was reading just to finish. At first I appreciated the symbolism of the Dutch House, but as Danny and Maeve's constant return to and fetishization of their past misfortune took over and eventually became the plot, it started to get old. The cover is undeniably beautiful and intriguing, but it's probably the most exciting part of the book."

This book was a gift from a friend and the first thing that drew me to it was the cover- a portrait of a beautiful, young girl whose eyes betrayed both reservation and a strong sense of resilience.This story beautifully captures the trials and travails of two siblings who survived life by clinging on to one another while the rest of their family fell apart. As we progress through the narrative, we observe how the characters gamble their life away in lieu of the hold their tragic past has on them, specifically a house. A house, whose ownership forever remained elusive to those who sought after it the most...I am constantly amazed and blown away by how authors like Ann Patchett find it in themselves to not only recognise the subtleties that mould,strengthen and weaken human relations but also lay them out with such tenacity and clarity that even the most dense of us feel like we've just topped a course in psychology. The meandering timelines, thoughts and plot lines often had me wondering where the story was going, if at all. Much like the cover though, if you manage to sit through it all, you will indeed be gifted with a true work of art. For me, the best kind of books are the ones that force you out of your comfort zone and into a realm that questions your own beliefs and helps shed light on refreshingly new perspectives. At one point the protagonist/narrator of asks his beloved sister - ""Do you ever think it's possible to see the past as it actually was?"" As we grow older, we tend to generate varied notions of our past, coloured and corrupted by the winds of change and time. This book had me stopping to ponder about life at various intervals which I absolutely loved.But most of all, I loved the book for its ability to refrain from judging even its most vulnerable and complicated characters which is something I strive to put into practice in real life."

1029,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5683254-carmen,Rating 5 out of 5,"Very interesting character study, and the effect of family dynamics on each member. The story is narrated by Danny, the youngest child of Cyril and Elna Conroy. Early on, Elna abandons her family to work with those in abject poverty, a la Mother Theresa. Danny's older sister, Maeve, takes on the roll of mother to him as he grows. There are constant maternal characters in the maid and the cook, who are sisters, and the appearance of a cold and manipulative step-mother and her two young daughters. The house is central, but not in the way that it becomes a character in and of itself. While it elicits emotions from the people living in the house, and it is definitely an imposing structure, it is more of a symptom rather than a cause. For example, Cyril falls in love with it and presents it to Elna as a gift. Elna sees it as a garish waste of money, an afront to good taste, and hates it from the beginning. The second wife, Claudia, marries Cyril simply to get into the house. She has loved it from afar for years, and finally becomes the mistress of the manor. It is the only home the two main children have ever known, and find that they are slowly and systematically ushered out by their new stepmother. While all of this is happening, the two main siblings are aging, going to college, living their lives. To avoid getting into the weeds of the story here, and to avoid any further spoilers, I will get straight to what I considered the matter of the book: the deeply interlocking relationship of Maeve and Danny. Maeve lives her life for Danny, never fulfilling any desires or dreams she may have of her own life. As a matter of fact, to see her vision of Danny come to life seems to be her main driving force. And Danny readily complies, oddly enough. There may be a little pushback, but nothing of consequence, and they both go through life knowing that this is the nature of their relationship. She decides that he will become a doctor, so he does. However, he hates practicing, and so never uses his degree. Instead he somewhat carries on in his father's footsteps of renovating properties, especially those in gentrifying neighborhoods, and either sells or rents them. Meanwhile, there is a very odd habit/tradition/compulsion for the two of them to drive back to the house and sit in the car, parked on the street, and stare at the house. Even after they move away, when they are in town, they do this. So, while there is the idea of Danny renovating properties, there is the juxtaposition of his stagnant life. There is a definite growth cycle that he enjoys professionally; but personally, he simply cannot or will not move on. And, as life so often does, they are all doomed to repeat the past. In one way or another, you will see the characters from the beginning emerge from the aged characters at the end. In tiny ways, in subtle ways, and in ways that almost knock you over. Patchett's writing is, as always, beautiful. Her story is compelling and emotional. There is a lot going on in this book. A lot of important characters, and decades told through the pages. But it is not cumbersome, trite or gratuitous. Patchett's ability to tell the story of so many disparate characters, living intersecting lives, and tying all of the threads together in the end is a marvel of her talent. Highly recommended."

1031,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6824064-zhixin,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Dutch House is another of those books that possesses such an utterly compelling voice, you know early on in the story that it would be 1) excellent and 2) impossible to put down. While being irresistibly carried along by the story’s motion, a part of you that you hold at a distance from the action is also marvelling at Patchett’s mastery of craft, in the amount she reveals and conceals at each point, the strokes she uses for an oblivious main character, the economic way she depicts relationship dynamics. It’s magnetic.The titular Dutch House refers to our protagonist’s childhood home, a beautiful house situated in Philadelphia, so-named because it used to belong to a Dutch family. It’s also the fixed point around which all the book’s events swirl, by virtue of its status as shared obsession among all the characters. Danny’s mother leaves him and his sister when he was 3, for the strange reason, he finds out later on, of hating the house; his father possesses that classic brand of masculinity that speaks little, expects full compliance, and prefers the traditional delineation of duties between men and women, neglecting the brilliant Maeve while grooming Danny to take over his company. Unfortunately two things happen to derail those plans: he marries a woman who has had her sights set on the house for a long time, and he dies. Danny and Maeve are kicked out, and their bitterness at the unjust turn of events binds them to the house and each other through the decades. Their subsequent decisions for survival are driven by this event; they have a habit of sitting in a parked car a distance away from the house observing it, and their narrow obsession naturally creates a barrier between them and people outside the household.I just read the synopsis that compares it to a dark fairy tale, which makes so much sense — there’s that delicious sensation of larger forces at play, there’s the evil stepmother of course, but I’m thinking as well of the house as a curse that needs to be broken — by future generations, by forgiveness, and letting go of its status on a pedestal.Beyond the symbolism, the undercurrents of gender dynamics also contribute to the book’s pull — we see the world through Danny’s eyes, which makes our recognition of how much he has been shielded from the day-to-day tasks that run a household, and the sacrifices his sister and wife unquestioningly make, even more frustrating. This is where Patchett’s skill shines — the moments where Danny’s self-occupation is broken through as he learns of something he should have connected long before, like his housekeepers being sisters, are when it dawns on us that Danny’s perspective is a restricted one. Like a mystery novel, we try to read between the lines of what Danny himself misses out, to unravel the subtext of the web of relationships.It’s a quest, at the end of it, for our characters and us: to reach a point of closure through a satisfactory understanding of events and motivations. First we go over old ground with new information, much like a literary analysis, much like the way we resolve the things that hurt; then past a point, say Enough. Move on."

1033,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6296954-jessica,Rating 3 out of 5,"Thanks to the publisher for the free review copyThis is my first Ann Patchett novel. The synopsis and cover of this one was super intriguing. I actually pre ordered the audiobook because it’s narrated by Tom Hanks. It’s getting a ton of buzz, Jenna Bush Hager just picked it as her monthly book club pick, and my favorite bookstagrammers have all rated it 5 stars. I was ready to love it, but it fell short for me.Here’s what I liked / what worked for me:Tom Hanks’s performance on the audiobook was perfection. The writing was good and the overall story was interestingHere’s why it didn’t work for me:I think I’ve realized that I have a limit on reminiscing. Are you the type of person who loves to tell the same stories over and over and reminisce on the past? Then you will probably like this book. It just felt like main characters (siblings Danny and Maeve) were always reminiscing on the past. Things like, “Do you remember when this happened..” or “I remember when....” or “I had forgotten about how....”. I think I feel more *immersed* in books when I’m not just hearing about things second hand or on the periphery. I want to be experiencing things alongside the characters.The actual Dutch House is like part estate / part museum. So you will either be enchanted by the descriptions of the architecture and all the historic details, or you might just get bored after a while (🤭😬🙋‍♀️).They would often visit the Dutch house after they no longer lived there, “We got in the car and drove to the Dutch House, just to check on things before dark”. To check on things? What??Danny and Maeve had a rough childhood, and in a sense they just couldn’t move on. I get it. They also would talk about the family that lived in the Dutch House before they did as children, even though they had never met them. Like “I wonder what Mrs.VanHoebeek was like”, or “what they thought about this”, or some other random thing. You learn random facts about the VanHoebeek family throughout the book but they weren’t particularly interesting to me. Again, if you’re interested in history, then this might be something that would be fun to read about.The synopsis states “Throughout their lives they return to the well-worn story of what they’ve lost with humor and rage”, which is pretty spot on with the tone and direction of this book. I’d describe it as “Rich kids lose everything and are obsessed with the house they grew up in and spend many nights parked across the street in the dark staring at the house and reminiscing”"
1034,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4725799-dana,Rating 3 out of 5,"The reviews of Patchett's newest novel were really, really good. Unfortunately, I could not give it a 4, let alone 5, star review. The cover is exquisitely beautiful, and the writing is, technically, perfect, The plot left me limp. At times, I was disengaged and could not connect well with the main characters, nor with their obsession with the house in which they lived as young children. The Dutch House was a massive house purchased in suburban Philadelphia by patriarch, Cyril Conroy, for his young wife and young daughter in the years following WWII. Maeve, the daughter, and subject of the painting which hung over the mantel in their home and which is also the cover photo of the novel, remembered more of her upbringing there than her little brother, Danny, born years later. Danny narrates the book about their life without their mother, who abandoned them and their father, when Danny was very young. We are brought inside his close relationship with Maeve, who was part mother, part sister to him. Years later, she needs him as much as he needed her when he was a little boy. Cyrill remarries a conniving and cruel woman, Andrea, who arrives with her two young girls, and proceeds to uproot the lives of Maeve and Danny, leaving them penniless, and without their rights to the Dutch House. All of this is explained in the book jacket, so I am not spoiling anything. We are then told about the decades which follow, the trials and tribulations, the minor joys (no one ever is really happy) that follow. My favorite story line pertained to Danny's relationship with Celeste, a girl he meets on the train when he is living in NYC to attend college, but I found the entire book quite depressing. I never mind a really sad book, but I like to be moved by the experiences of the characters. In this one, I was not moved, could not emote, and just wanted to get to the end, so I could bid the book farewell. The ending unfolded at record speed, with several major events happening at once. Some of it seemed contrived to me. I could only recommend ""The Dutch House"" to those who want an artfully beautiful book on their shelves, not for those who want to read a really good book. P.S. I hope this review makes sense. I am recovering from miserable dental surgery, and am on pain meds. Chalk up any non-sensical sentences to the meds! "

This is one of those rare books that I not only enjoyed from the first sentence to the last, but also it touched my heart and soul in a way I always hope will happen with each book I read but only rarely does. Magnificently written by Ann Patchett, this is the story of the Conroy siblings, Maeve and Danny. Told in the first person by Danny over a five-decade span, it begins with a recounting of their extraordinary childhood, growing up in what was known as ""the Dutch house,"" a mansion—with a ballroom on the third floor and a dining room ceiling decorated in gold leaf—in the suburbs of Philadelphia. But all too soon, this magical world was destroyed for the children by the parents who were supposed to be loving them and taking care of them. First abandoned by their mother, ignored by their father, and later cast out on to the street by their stepmother, Maeve and Danny only have each other. She fiercely protects Danny. He idolizes Maeve. But when the unimaginable actually happens, their loving sibling relationship is tested to the core. This is an astute psychological study of what it means to be a family and how those relationships—no matter how damaged they may be—ultimately determine who we are as adults. And it is only by forgiving, even when everything about it seems unforgiveable, that we find real happiness and contentment in life. The writing is bold and forthright, but when needed it's perfectly subtle and nuanced. The story is definitely one that is character-driven so the plot plays second fiddle, but even so the ""what happens next"" part is absolutely captivating.Bonus: Maeve Conroy is a type 1 diabetic, as are my son and grandson. I am forever grateful to Ann Patchett for her intelligent and perceptive descriptions of what it means to live with this dreadful disease.This is a 10-star book in a five-star world. Read it. Savor it. It's a very special book."

The story follows the lives of brother and sister, Danny the younger sibling by seven years, who tells the story and his sister Maeve. The house was unique their father had bought it before their mother saw it. It was his haven and her hell. Elma had always been a careful woman with money and now there she was with servants. Not something she could adjust to. Their mother often left and returned until one day their father told them she wouldn’t be coming back.When their father turned up one day with Andrea, a much younger woman than him, their lives began to change. When Andrea brought her two daughters Maeve and Danny were left to look after them, their lives became secondary. When tragedy struck their lives became their own.This is an epic read that stretches years through the lives of the two siblings as the past and the people that had impacted them are never far away. The Dutch House still has that magnetic pull to them but a greater pull keeps them still at arm’s length away.The story is tremendous, with characters you feel you have known as they age from chapter to chapter. Their struggles and heartbreak, with an end that just knocked me off balance with its shocks and aftershocks. Perfection, just perfection.I wish to thank Rachel Wilkie Head of Marketing at Bloomsbury Books for inviting me to read and review this book and for an e-copy of the book via NetGalley, which I have reviewed honestly."
1037,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"There is no doubt that Ann Patchett is one of our greatest novelists. The Dutch House proves, once again, that Patchett can entrance and engage the reader as she invites us into the lives of her characters. This novel is narrated by Danny, struggling under the weight of being deserted by his mother while living with his aloof father. His life is held intact by the devotion of his older sister Maeve and the house staff. It is the marriage of their father to the very wicked Andrea that becomes the catalyst for much of what happens to Danny and Maeve in the novel. She is so well drawn that she is the wretched symbol of step-parenting. Essentially, Andrea’s actions cause Danny and Maeve to become a lifelong unit, and this co-dependence will impact every event in their lives. I think the concept of blended families will certainly be questioned after reading this. Clearly, the Conroys did not become The Brady Bunch. I was totally mesmerized by the novel and will highly recommend it to all my book clubs. I know that there is so much I want to share with others, that I cannot wait for the discussions. Though this is a sophisticated and thought provoking novel, much like RUN (an earlier Patchett novel), that it can have a place in libraries and reading groups of High School students since there are so many who are members of challenging families, and will identify with the family situation. I truly thank Netgalley for giving me the gift of reading this extraordinary novel. It’s certainly on my best books of the year list."

But now a few days after finishing it I have realised that, for me, it provided so much to think about and the messaging that it gave me has upped by rating to a 4 star. Ann Patchett’s book “Commonwealth” that I read a few years ago was amazing – some of the best writing and observations that I have read in a novel. I recall that the first chapter of that book was one of the best I have ever read. So I came to this novel with high hopes. Yet, it was a subtle book and in the end I realised this is truly her style – observing and then writing about all the subtleties and complexities that underly our basic relationships. This is the story of Danny and Maeve – told from Danny’s perspective – brother and sister. They have an unusual relationship for siblings – extremely dependant on each other well into their middle age. At the centre of everything is “the Dutch House” – an enormous grand house that his poor war veteran father manages to acquire. His mother can’t stand the house and all that it represents and that simple stance sees her abandon her young children. The impact of this decision and the impact of their father remarrying is jarring and creates daily, life long issues for Danny and Maeve. When their step mother throws them both out they weirdly find themselves returning to the street the Dutch House is in regularly. They can’t live without each other – despite marriages and careers – and the eventual return of their mother when they are in their late 40’s is also life changing. Despite it’s slowness, it is a book that provides much to think about. "

I've read a good many and they hurt they are so good. The author's talent is overwhelming. The plot, delivery, message, words, sentences are so perfectly arranged it doesn't seem possible. When I finish one of these books I usually burst into tears and I realize how shallow I've been breathing. Barely enough breathing to keep me alive. ""It's a good thing the book is over,"" I think. Crying. I lack oxygen. I generally clutch the book. Trying to keep a bit of it close. Because it's over. And I did all this with ""The Dutch House"". I cried, clutched and shallow breathed. Ann, Ann, Ann. Thank you so much for sharing your talent. Some things I loved: The house as a character. A fully developed, yet still mysteriously hazy. What the heck did it REALLY look like? I think I know then, I really don't. I need a photo. But it's a mystery.The bringing up of both a mother leaving her kids and of parents sending their children to boarding school.

I appreciate her beautiful use of language, her ability to imbue a novel with atmosphere, and her capacity to create complex and relatable characters, folks who are as flawed as they are heroic. Her newest book did not let me down. This is the story of a family, how it’s created and how easily it’s destroyed. Told through multiple timelines, we see marriages begin and end; a mother who leaves and the stepmother who replaces her; a father who provides and disappoints; servants who become family; and a brother-sister relationship so beautiful and strong, it left me in tears.But my favorite character? The house. Make no mistake, the Dutch House is the central character of the story. It informs, influences, and is otherwise responsible for every pivotal moment in the lives of the Conroy family. Though haunting, it claims no paranormal power. It manifests the true power of how we define home, how we long for it and how we can abuse it. This story asks tough questions. What are we owed by our parents? Can we ever truly be free of the past? What is the cost of obsession? Is forgiveness really possible?Much like life, Patchett doesn’t provide any real answers. We have to find those on our own. If you need quick narrative action or are easily confused by jumps in a story’s timeline, this is likely a book better left on the shelf. If you’re into audiobooks and like Tom Hanks, this should be added to your TBR immediately. His narration absolutely brings the book to life!"

The book kept me interested the whole time I was reading it, again I don't know if it was because I was enjoying it so much that Tom Hanks was narrating! 😂"
1042,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1003131-m,Rating 5 out of 5,"Many thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for the ARC of this title, another fascinating and satisfying novel by Ann Patchett. ""The Dutch House,"" bought by self-made real estate magnate for his family at the end of WWII, becomes almost a character unto itself, as it looms large over the Conroy family members' lives in the fifty years following its purchase. Central to the story are Danny and Maeve, the Conroy children whose lives are deeply shaped by their experiences both in the Dutch House and outside of it after they are evicted by their stepmother. The bond between the siblings, the different paths their lives take, and the evolving, sometimes surprising family dynamics make for compelling reading. Another wonderful, re-readable novel by this author, and one of my favorite books of 2019 so far. Five stars."
1043,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"The house is the central character in this novel. The story begins and ends at this large, wondrous house built in the early Twentieth Century with it's intricate carvings and portraits of the owners on the wall. The house attracts some like honey and to others its largesse is repellent. The other central feature of this novel is the relationship between big sister Maeve and her little brother, Danny. Maeve becomes Danny's central caretaker after their mother abandons the family. Later a wicked stepmother enters the scene- she wants the house maybe more than she wants their emotionally closed off father. Maeve and Danny spend the rest of their lives grappling with what the house means to them. It's a really interesting premise for a novel. I read it greedily and enjoyed every minute. But as an Ann Patchett fan, I can't say this is her best work. The story is narrated by Danny in simple, rather choppy language. He's one of those men who just reacts to all the women in his life- his sister, stepmother, wife, daughter. I wasn't convinced that Patchett had really gotten into his head. Maeve is the far more interesting character but we only know of her from Danny's perspective. The ending is wrapped up hastily and not in the most convincing way. That said, I would recommend reading this. It's a memorable novel- far better than many. Just not in the league of Ann Patchett's best."

In the space of an hour, Ann Patchett managed to share the agonies and ecstasies of writing The Dutch House (including the entire destruction of the first draft) along with an enormously entertaining view of various other books by other writers and/or interviewees whom she has read and/or met in recent years.An especially great story was the one about how Patchett commissioned local Nashville artist Noah Saterstrom to paint the portrait of the book's heroine Maeve Conroy at 10-years-of-age for the book cover by asking for ""a ten-year old girl, in a red coat, it has been painted in 1950, in the style of 1910, the painter is Scottish and she is in love with him."" Saterstrom produced the work in 4 days.My thanks to Different Drummer Books of Burlington, Ontario for supporting this author's talk and others. I well recommend their store and authors' series if you are in the Greater GTA area of Southern Ontario."

This was the second Ann Patchett novel I read, but won't be the last. It had the same feeling for me as Bel Canto. Characters that I loved to spend time with, following their growing up and turning into adults with their strengths and flaws. Lovely cover as well.As the lives of brother and sister Danny and Maeve progress, the Dutch House is always a factor in their lives. First as the symbol of prosperity for their father, then the force that drove their mother away and attracted their stepmother. Later as a meeting point for brother and sister when they spend time in the car emphasising their tie to eachother. In the end a place where the people from their former lives meet again and reconcile.The strongest theme was the sense of duty of care. The duty that parents have towards their children, the duty that couples have to care for eachother, the duty of the servants towards their employers and vice versa, the care between siblings, the responsibility of the stepparent, duty towards society."
1048,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4753536-elle,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5 stars.I listened to the audiobook of this novel, which was narrated fantastically by Tom Hanks. The book is a character-driven novel focusing on the life of two siblings in Pennsylvania, following them from their childhood years into the ends of adulthood. The writing is descriptive and flowing with great character to the dialogue. The narrative is delivered by Danny, the younger of the two siblings, and the portrayal of him by Hanks in the audio version is incredibly well done. This is not a book for those who are bothered by a shifting and non-linear timeline in a plot. Though I feel it was done quite well, I can see that some may become confused, and even potentially aggravated, by this approach. For me, it added another layer of complexity that helped to keep the book interesting and to develop the plot in small strokes as the chapters moved on. I enjoyed this sweeping narrative and felt that it added a bit more diversity to my reads this year. It's a good story and well-balanced between positive and negative events. There is a large range of emotion in the pages and the saga kept me intrigued. Though not in my usual range of reading (I prefer plot-driven stories), The Dutch House was definitely worth the time and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a strong narrative with full-bodied characters and a family focus.

The family dynamics, the undercurrents, insecurities and resentments were interwoven to produce an intoxicating stew! And what a fascinating cover! There have been countless glowing reviews, and I’m right there with them! A skillfully woven plot, peopled with believable, flawed characters yielded an excellent novel.There was much prose to savor, as Ann Patchett’s fans have always maintained! Here is a quote I found noteworthy. Danny is enrolled in med school, and while he’s succeeding with ease he’s not thrilled. When his sister Maeve asks Danny what’s so terrible about medical school, he responds:‘The worst part is understanding you’re going to die. You think you understand it. You think that when you’re ninety-six you’ll lie down on the couch after a big Thanksgiving dinner and not wake up, but even then you’re not really sure. Maybe there’ll be some special dispensation for you. Everybody thinks that.” I understand that the audible version, read by Tom Hanks, was beautifully done. It’s tempting! And I’ll certainly consider giving another of Ann Patchett’s novels a second chance! "

It’s hard to beat Tom Hanks as a narrator and I enjoyed the sassiness he brought to Danny’s first person voice. This story was ultimately a love letter to Maeve and a lovely one at that. I was worried when so much action with Andrea took place in the beginning that the rest of the book would have nowhere and would drag along but this never took place. I was just as engaged with any given predicament Danny and Maeve found themselves in over the rest of their lives. I liked the play on an atypical family structure, as when both of Danny’s parents were out of the picture one would think he’d have felt more lost the rest of his life but he always had Maeve’s steady presence. The rest of the cast of characters were intriguing as well, especially Celeste and the housekeepers (though I didn’t care for Fluffy as much). I was completely on Danny’s side when their mother did reappear. I don’t think I could have been nearly as forgiving as Maeve in that situation, considering the years and years of absence. I could not believe she wanted to take care of Andrea. That being said, I did enjoy the reunion of the characters at the end and thought for a novel that spanned so many years, it felt complete. "
1051,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8247644-brooklyn,Rating 4 out of 5,"The Dutch House - Ann Patchetts latest - is family drama and fairy tail. With rich and beautifully detailed and insightful characterizations- esp the relationship between Danny the narrator and his sister Maeve that spans almost 5 decades. Other reviewers have noted that this is the story of Hansel and Gretel complete with a wicked stepmother Andrea. There is such rich characterizations here that draw you in - the father, the mother, the stepmother and the brother and sisters. And then there is the Dutch House a character in the story as well as an almost magical presence that draws all the characters in. Descriptions of Danny and Maeve growing up in the Dutch House with their father is very gripping and moving. Themes of compassion- family - love - ambition - life itself and how it plays out are gorgeously displayed and elaborated. I enjoyed Bel Canto and State of Wonder more overall- and this the 4 stars - but still found this book hypnotic - haunting- elegiac. And often very moving. There is a sense of magical realism here - with the house as central character - who never changes and remains constant on the characters lives - the house which influences and inspires and motivates much of the action. Beautiful read."
1052,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31954975-meggie,Rating 4 out of 5,"Can a home be a character in a novel? Well, Ann Patchett thinks so, and she did a pretty great job with it. I’m a sucker for epic family novels and this one was a super read. The Conroy children (brother and sister Danny and Maeve—what a name) find themselves living in a spectacular home: the Dutch House. The grandeur of the home sucks the family in and spits them out, setting the family’s course for the whole novel. There were slight twists and turns that kept me swiftly turning the pages!Certainly character driven, I loved the development of the characters—major and minor—and would have loved even more description of these fascinating people. And really, the beauty and details of the Dutch House could have been developed even more to build the suspense and pain and memory. But perhaps that was designed to let our minds run wild. And one more note, Patchett narrates the book from the perspective of Danny. Often, I’m not a fan of writers telling their story from the opposite gender. But Patchett does so convincingly, and perhaps better portrays Maeve and Danny’s wife Celeste better because of it.Everyone has some longing and pain and struggle associated with home, and Patchett touches those parts of humanity so well."
1053,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19317957-fiona-mitchell,Rating 4 out of 5,"While the lives of the family in this epic novel keep altering, the Dutch House remains unchangeable with its ornate fixtures and carvings, built of so much glass that someone standing outside it can see right through it.Siblings Danny and Maeve keep driving back to their childhood home, sitting in a car on the kerb to talk about the past which unfolds through Danny’s eyes. When Danny and Maeve’s mother abandons her children and they end up being brought up by their father, the ice-cold Andrea enters their lives. And while she appears to show the siblings no love whatsoever, domestic helpers Jocelyn and Sandy step into the breach.Patchett's writing is without fanfare, so that style never gets in the way of this transfixing tale. There is love; there are family feuds; there are sacrifices. The plot isn’t in a rush to get anywhere and towards the end I found myself wanting a little more pace. Having said that, what a welcome experience it was to read a novel that is simply good old-fashioned storytelling at its best. If you want strong characters and a read you can linger over - instead of frenetically rushing through - this one’s for you. What a fine writer Patchett is. "

It is a beautiful family saga about a house, familial bonds and accepting the life you want to live. I think that Patchett is better than almost anyone else about describing the bonds that develop between humans, whether it be during a hostage situation, at a home for unwed mothers, deep in a jungle or between family members trying to distance themselves from the past. I received a digital ARC from the publisher through Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review. "

I had started out in the first quarter thinking it would be a five star rating , however I was really disappointed at the lack of development in the characters. I usually appreciate family dynamics in a novel but this one left me with reservations and questioning who I was rooting for . The disappointment I had in the mother leaving and the wicked non empathetic step mom taking over the house made me feel very angry . I loved the bond between Danny and Maeve though it seemed as though there was always something left out in their conversations . The children and their father had a very unusual relationship, it appeared to be a strain in letting them know the whole truth in their lives . Maybe it’s the time period that creates this strain , I don’t know. I think I just wanted more detail on why the mom left and why the dad married again and why take Andrea . The novel ended on a very unique level so I felt a little redeemed by the outcome . Still I would give 3 stars for the lovely writing and story telling but as far as the characters, I wish they were more developed. Great book choice all the same ! "

I don't feel like I read an Ann Patchett book, so much as inhabit it. The slightly wistful and melancholic tone of the narrator reminds me of the narrators in some of John Irving's books, like A Prayer for Owen Meany and The Cider House Rules. I don't want to give the impression that this is a depressing book - the characters are lively and witty in their own ways, not least among them the incomparable Maeve who is such a strong character, lightly drawn. We don't know her inside out, but if we did, the character wouldn't be Maeve. And the Dutch House - I think Patchett purposely described it in bits and pieces, giving the reader some visual specifics, but leaving us to put it together using our own imagination. Mine was Frank Lloyd Wright-ish."

Ann Pratchett is a gifted writer - I read all of her books but this one is such a moving piece of art. Danny narrates the story how he and his sister Maeve were heartbroken when their mother left them as young children to go to India. Danny never quite got over his resentment. ""Abandoning your children to go help the poor of India means you're a narcissist who wants the adoration of strangers.""Then years later their stepmother kicks them out of the beautiful house that was their only link to a lamented childhood. Danny goes to med school, raises a family, keeps close contact to his only remaining family member Maeve but each generation has some sort of binding connection to their majestic childhood home, the Dutch House. Danny always believed what his father told him. ""Maeve got sick because our mother left and if our mother ever came back, Maeve would die."" Good mix of joy and misery written oh so elegantly."

The story follows their lives as they grow, how the childhood events influence them and how their feelings about those events alter over time.I spent much of the first half thinking this one of those books good enough to continue, but with main characters I felt I could root for if not relate to. The ending and closure, while not affecting my perception of Maeve and Danny, brought them and the story to such a beautiful close that my rating rose. My third Patchett after The Magician's Apprentice and State of Wonder, both of which which I thought very good, this one joins them as warmly recommended."
1059,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1425835-michael,Rating 4 out of 5,"Ann Patchett can write a compelling novel on just about any topic. In The Dutch House, she focuses on a family who becomes wealthy, and spends part of their life in a beautiful mansion in Pennsylvania. But things don't last forever in this world, and the two adult children, Maeve and Danny find themselves unceremoniously banished from their childhood home to make their own way in the world. Danny narrates this tale, but Maeve is the powerful presence, beloved guardian, fierce force of nature. The hold the house has over this family is a strong one, even as past secrets emerge, and future lives are built.There aren't a whole lot of novels that focus on the relationship between a brother and a sister, and Patchett really does a great job capturing this one. I enjoyed watching Maeve and Danny grow up and deal with past regrets, new loves, the rise, fall and rise again of fortunes, and well... life. And in Ann Patchett's hands, it also makes for one top notch novel."

Patchett explores her theme of home and family through a story about a mother who has gone (to India and who knows where beyond) and a wicked stepmother straight from fairy tales. The story is well told and the characters, particularly the siblings Danny and Maeve, are well developed. The most interesting parts of the novel for me were, firstly, the different characters' attachment to, dislike or even obsession with the house of the title. Then there were the study and employment pathways the characters took because or despite of their abilities and interests. Finally, there was the return of the mother and how this played out in the lives of those she had left behind. It is a rich novel in many ways but it simply didn't engage me as fully as I would have hoped. Three and a half stars."

I have so many thoughts about this book but I don’t think I will be able to put them into a review. I read bits of this on print, and some on audio - and Tom Hanks narrates the audiobook, so would highly recommend checking that out. I loved the character of the Dutch House, which serves as a sight for Danny and his entire family’s ruin and fortune. I loved the tense relationships, the arc of their mother, the jumping time lines, Celeste and May, but most of all I loved the sibling relationship. So much of Maeve is my sister, and I got extremely teary eyed by the end. But I can’t express how wonderful the characters of the two siblings are, and what they mean to me as a team, and in terms of the book in general! I even love the side characters, which are so flawed and humane: Fluffy, Danny’s father, Sandy, Celeste. Gosh, I really loved this book! Highly recommend."

I really loved the characters and I thought the writing was beautifully simple but there was no climax.  	The only word I can think to describe the Dutch House is normal. Everything here could easily happen in real life…every single thing. The Dutch House's normalness is both good and bad. Good in that the dialogue is witty and convincing, the characters are well-developed and likeable, and the situations are believable. However, bad in that there are no over-the-top scenarios or exciting moments to drive home any real point. 	The Dutch House is just a good book. Cute, but nothing to blow you away, no grand themes, no defining moment. Just a lifetime of interesting family drama and a big old house. With that being said, I do think this will be one of those books that I remember more fondly the longer I have to digest it. Verdict: Puzzlingly normal"

It's the story of a family and a home, an edifice, that bound them together. It is the warp and weft of real life, of wounds and love, loyalty, conflict, anger, hurt, expectations, promises broken and kept. It is written beautifully, and I loved every minute of listening to it. Throughout I was reminded of the home I grew up in, the one my eldest brother purchased from my parents, the home he has restored and is selling to his daughter. The Dutch house of the title was built in the 1800's by the Vanhubakkes, who see their wealth disappear in the great depression. It is then purchased by Cyril Conroy as a surprise gift for his wife and their young family. What happens to the Conroy's and the people in their lives is the story, the house is the repository of their lives, and ultimately of their healing."

Her character development is always superb which allows the people she writes about to become part of the reader's life. This book was no exception.The very complicated relationship between Danny and Maeve was fascinating! The other players that Patchett brings to the canvas are unique and diverse. The insights into human nature that each character provides are so slowly and beautifully developed as to make than unforgettable. This book also creates a scenario where a house also seems to be a ""character"". Patchett's creativity makes this plausible.  ""There are a few times in life when you leap up and that past that you'd been standing on falls behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet in place, and for a moment you are suspended, knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself.""

I’ve never read or listened to a story by Patchett though I’ve seen her name countless times and I guess it took Hanks to get me interested but now I think it may be the beat modern fiction I’ve read in...years? It was emotionally and psychologically insightful, moving, and visually absorbing, which I love. I loved the descriptions of this old Dutch House, its history of Gatsby-esque parties and imperfect humans, the idealism, the failures, the loves, and then the odd come-full-circle conclusion. It didn’t answer all my questions and the mom figures all made me extremely irritated throughout, but that’s what made it very real and provocative. I can see why Hanks chose to narrate it."

The story is narrated by Danny (played by Tom Hanks in the audio version), the son of occupants of the dutch house, and his relationship with his sister, Maeve. The book begins in Danny's childhood and tells the story of his life through adulthood and then his own family. Frankly, I expected more after the rave reviews. I was quite bored through the first third until (no spoiler here) something happens that alters the path of Danny's life. What follows is better than the first part and an ok story. I looked through the reviews of people who gave it 4 or 5 stars, but, that's all there was, the star rating, no reason. Sorry, no raving about this one from me."

His mother left when his was very young as he's been told: because she never liked the house. The story takes the reader/listener through five decades of Danny's life and is really a love story between Danny and his sister and their relationship with the Dutch House and everyone's life it touches. The Dutch House is simply a beautifully written story and very touching story about relationships and how the importance of things change as we get older. And you just can't help but adore Tom Hanks who narrates it. I think my favorite part was how he always kind of sounds annoyed at how he had to read out loud what chapter he was on.

It is just unethical :) And even though I’m not a huge fan of fiction, I have to say that I really enjoyed this. Loved the main protagonists, Danny and Maeve, and their brother-sister relationship dynamics. On the other hand, I was so irritated by their mother and I just couldn’t fathom how she had abandoned her kids because of a house while being “Mother Teresa” to other people in need (including the evil stepmom! That was the last straw for me!). The wallpaper of that house, the Van Hoebeeks’ portraits, and the ceiling of that dining room did not sound that terrible to me!"

I can't say there was one character that I didn't like. It just all fit so well. My favorite character would be Maeve for sure. I loved her sarcasm and the bluntness she delivered to everyone. It was so endearing to listen to her and Danny's relationship. I would like to say more but I will just end up blowing the book wide open and that wouldn't be nice for those that haven't read it. It was so enjoyable growing up with these two siblings.*I gave it 4 stars because there was a bit of language and some sexual content. It wasn't very descriptive, but there nonetheless."

It is the story of the relationship between a brother and his older sister and their parents. The large elegant mansion, called The Dutch House, in which these two siblings grow up, and from which they are later evicted by their evil step-mother after the death of their father, serves as the centerpiece of this entire decades-long story.This story really made me reflect on the significance and the fragility of the relationship between parents and their children. It also sheds a lot of light on how those relationships are so intertwined with memories and experiences from our childhood. All of this gave me a lot of food for thought and reflection as a more-than-middle-aged father of four fully grown children."

Paljon tässä sen kanssa olikin samaa, jonkinlaista rauhallista, yksittäisen perheen (ja talon) elämään syventyvää kerrontaa, jossa kohtalot kietoutuvat nätisti toisiinsa. Pidemmän päälle tarina oli kuitenkin varsin puuduttava - eikä yksin siksi, että tämän taustalla olevat perustarinat tuntuvat toistuvan amerikkalaisissa kulttuurituotteissa kirjasta, elokuvasta ja tv-sarjasta toiseen. Sopii kuitenkin mainiosti, jos kaipaa jotain lempeää, maailmaa mullistamatonta kirjallisuutta, ja voisihan tästä varmaan vähän syvempääkin teemaa saada kaivettua, jos lähtisi tarttumaan pieneen koukkuun siitä, miksi äidin hylkäämä perhe on kulttuurillisesti edelleen niin suuri tabu verrattuna isien hylkäämiin perheisiin."

This book is so beautifully written, it’s so human, so very emotional and whimsical while being blunt and unforgiving. I will think about the wonderfully constructed relationship of Maeve and Danny, the struggle with their father and the disappearance of their mother for a long time and that’s such a hard thing to do. The tension the house creates is with out a doubt one of the best accomplishments I’ve read by an author, the house became another character. Representing the failures, hopes and dreams of the family. Narrated by the son Danny, it feels like these stories are real people coming from real life and not fictional. Anyway not to ramble on any longer, I highly recommend you pick up this book if you’re a fan of the author or just love a good story. 4 stars. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ "
1073,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13009180-leslie-ann,Rating 4 out of 5,"Ann Patchett is one of the few authors whose latest work I will read regardless of what she writes about. The lively prose - wonderfully narrated by Tom Hanks - eased any discomfort I had over the nonlinear structure. It will take me more time to appreciate how Patchett wove together the numerous storylines about motherhood, forgiveness, and destiny (among other themes). For now, I am simply in awe of her skill.7 May 2020 update: discussing this book with my book club really helped make this book more memorable. It is striking that this book is unlike Patchett's previous novels in that there isn't a single event that propels the action. Instead, the book is about relationships and the vulnerability needed to maintain them. "
1074,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48335662-jackie,Rating 3 out of 5,"Updated: Since this came available on audio, I decided to give it another shot. I finished it, but I definitely don't get what people were raving about. This is the second Ann Patchett book I’ve tried to read but couldn’t finish. The story is all over the place, constantly shifting back and forth in time, and nothing is happening. The story idea described on the jacket copy bears no relation to what I’ve just read 50+ pages of. I am having the same problem with this novel that i had with the other (Commonwealth). Patchett is describing ridiculously wealthy people who share no similarities with actual human beings i know. These characters are glamorous and wealthy, living in estates and having servants about whom they know nothing. I fail to see the interest they hold."
1075,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/843571-tensy-bookdoyen,Rating 5 out of 5,"I love Ann Patchett's writing and am a big fan of her previous novels, Bel Canto, Commonwealth and The State of Wonder. She has a way of writing which is inscrutable in a way that absolutely engrosses the reader in a slowly evolving plot with wonderful characters. This story centers around a fractured family living in a suburb outside Philadelphia told through the point of view of the youngest child, Danny Conroy. It covers a lifespan of conflict, joy, the struggle to follow your dreams, and how love can heal lasting wounds. I loved that Patchett made the house itself a central character of the novel as is the portrait of Danny's self-assured sister, Maeve, reproduced on the cover. I found the cover so beautiful that I looked up its painter, Noah Saterstrom. "

Sure, it's well written and sure, Tom Hanks as the audio narrator is wonderful - but its just a story about siblings clinging to each other after the desertion of their mother. It's now several weeks since I finished the book and I've had a chance to think about my thoughts on this. How much do we live in the past? How much does the past affect the choices we make as adults? And how do we draw the line between devotion to our family and devotion to our well being? Its a very good and thoughtful book that you'll be able to read at night without fear of nightmares but will ponder during the light of the day."

Patchett's writing is like a sip of red wine that you need to let sit on your tongue to let its flavour fill your mouth.~The plot is slow-paced but beautifully so. This sweet, slow pace transported me to the world of Maeve and Danny Conroy and the phenomenal Dutch House they lived in.~The Dutch House witnesses a mother leaving her children, a wicked stepmother, children being thrown out . . . a family come apart.It was an absolute delight to read this book—even though I was wiping my tears away while reading the third and final part.~This book is a story about memories, longing, relationships, secrets, and, maybe, even forgiveness.Highly recommended!"
1078,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13201059-kateryna,Rating 3 out of 5,"The story is centered around a house, known as The Dutch House, and the Conroy family whose mother left because she couldn't stand the house any longer. There’s not really a plot beyond two people growing up and going from childhood to adulthood. It started as a 5 star book then as the story progressed from the past to the present it just kept slipping to a 3 star. Although I thought this book was well written, I found the story frankly uninteresting. I kept waiting for something to happen, but then it would go to a flashback for the hundredth time. There was resolution in the end but rather hurried and unbelievable. All that being said, I wanted to love this book but I couldn't get into it and thought it fell pretty flat. "
1079,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2725704-brett-benner,Rating 5 out of 5,"Ann Patchett having a new book published should be classified as a national holiday. She is such an amazing writer and creates such honest, relatable, flawed, real characters you can’t help getting completely attached to. Spanning fifty years and as told by the younger of two siblings, Danny and Maeve spend their early years being raised by their emotional aloof Father after their Mother abandons them. Their home is an expansive estate in the suburbs of Philadelphia which quickly becomes a prison of sorts after their Father suddenly dies and they are left to be raised by their self serving Stepmother. It’s a book about letting go of the past and learning to forgive. It’s about the bond of siblings,the pursuit of dreams, and the memories and people that tether us. Great book. "
1080,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/352711-leftbanker,Rating 3 out of 5,"The mostly elegantly-written novel of a completely pointless and unmemorable story, if I can even say that there is a story between these pages. Most of it reads like an endless creative writing exercise which for me is pure torture. Ann Pratchett can write, she just seems to have nothing to say, if this novel—my first—is any indication of her work.Call me a class warrior, but I usually hate books about rich people, or royals, or minor royals, or semi-rich folks. In this tale, the boy goes to Columbia medical school just to waste his step-mother’s money. It was completely preposterous, and even if ever there was a kid in real life who made it through medical school only to become a real estate mogul, I wouldn’t want to read about it."
1081,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54036132-misty-galbraith,Rating 5 out of 5,"My favorite audiobook of the year! I loved listening to the familiar voice of Tom Hanks…it felt like watching a movie with him as Danny, the storyteller. The characters were endearing and I wondered what it would be like to have a sibling bond like Maeve and Danny? Their bond both saved them and doomed them in many ways. The illusion to Cinderella, a slight reference in the text, shows through with the evil stepmother and two step sisters and the death of the father. I was in awe that Danny would struggle through medical school to satisfy his sisters need for revenge, when he never intended to be a practicing doctor! I will miss the soothing voice of Hanks and continue to think about the characters and their complicated, very human relationships. "

The narrator is Danny and he's telling their story. The focus point is The Dutch House where they live. The language is so fluid and easy to read but I had a hard time getting in to the story. I think it was because I didn't warm up to any of the characters. When the story is character driven and you don't like them, it's difficult to find it more than ok. I read Bel Canto by Ann Patchett and thought it was so great. This book didn't live up to my expectations, unfortunately.Thank you to Edelweiss and the publisher for the free copy in exchange of an honest review. "
1083,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39302063-joan-happel,Rating 5 out of 5,"Ann Patchett is at her best in this family drama, lightened up just enough with elements of humor and the quirkiness of some of her characters. It is a novel about distance that can exist between parents and children, about the strong bond that can exist between siblings, and how these relationships change and mutate overtime. The story deals with the human need for possessions and what happens to us when we lose those beloved possessions. This is a sweeping, engaging and often thought-provoking novel that readers will clamor for. Beautifully written and atmospheric with characters that you will love and hate. I highly recommend.Thank you to Harper/Collins and NetGalley for the eARC"
1084,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5848832-janet-lynch,Rating 4 out of 5,"Beautifully written, sometimes achingly sad, I really enjoyed Ann Patchett’s newest book. She’s an author that always delves deeply into her characters and this book was no exception. It was a book about two children, Maeve and Danny, but also a book about a house. Narrated by Danny, the book spanned five decades and it felt as if the The Dutch House was in charge of the plot through it all. Deserted by their mother at a young age, raised by an indifferent father, The Dutch House provided stability for them both. Until it wasn’t theirs any longer. Can you spend your entire lives fixated on a house?"
1085,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19389962-authentikate,Rating 4 out of 5,"3.5 STARS rounded up.The Dutch House is a moving family saga. It deftly plays the right notes—ambition, grief, jealousy, loss—with the kind of honesty that few writers possess. But...for me, it wasn’t historical enough to fit the genre of HF. That disappointed me. History was nothing more than a time period, a backdrop for the drama between father and children...stepmother and step kids, etc. History played little role in the novel and for a HF buff, that took this rating down. It didn’t deliver here. That said, readers wishing to visit The Dutch House will be treated to a skillfully told family yarn, painful and poignant in equal parts. "

I felt the characters Danny and Maeve hard to get excited about. I really wanted to get inside their heads, but that was never going to happen. They were given little depth, and I found myself wondering about anyone who would sit in a car for hours like a cardboard cutout gazing at the house they had once lived in. Where did their obsession with this house come from? I know I am in a minority here, but I just don't understand why so much praise has been given here. "

I think it is Patchett’s skill with character presentation and development. Her characters live, you care deeply for them, they react to each other and the world around them with nuance and insight. With Patchett’s skilled touch, they evolve subtlety and believably. We feel strongly with them as they experience joy, anguish, betrayal, devotion. She tells an interesting story about the people who lived in a house - “the Dutch House” - over several generations, and how they impact the lives of each other. But it is the characters themselves, more than the story, that give this book a life of its own."

This book doesn’t disappoint as Ann Patchett rarely does. The Dutch House is a wonderful story about growing up and growing old and the things that wound us and heal us. Cyril Conroy buys a palatial mansion on the outskirts of Philadelphia, The Dutch House, and the story begins. It weaves through multiple generations with one narrator, Danny, Cyril’s son. A wonderful family saga and a pleasure to read. "

I can't add to them, and one reason I can't is because I can't really explain why I loved this book. I think because the way Patchett writes, the characters are so REAL and HUMAN and loving and flawed that when I close the book at the end I don't feel like I've been reading a book. I've been IN the book, in the Dutch House and I'm not sure I ever want to leave there. Ann Patchett has done it again. Every once of her books is different, and everyone is marvelous."

I adored this book and could not stop listening to Tom Hanks as the narrator; I wanted this book to never end. Heartbreaking, redemptive, and at times, soul crushing, this story revolves around the Dutch house, an exquisite mansion that is the main character of the book. It is difficult to write a review while tears run down one's face but I will come back to this after some reflection. This book, just wow. Now i have to read some reviews!"
1092,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15794408-mk,Rating 3 out of 5,"This book doesn’t really fit into any one category. It pegs itself as a multigenerational story but, while there are many generations they aren’t the focus. It starts off seeming as if it might be some kind of revenge drama, or childhood trauma drama, and it kind of is that but not really. There’s not really a plot beyond two people growing up and going from childhood to adulthood. So if you like plot, don’t bother with this one. If you are looking for an interesting character study for 2/3rds of the book that fails in the final act, this is your story."

The story scans decades with a mother who disappears, an emotionally distant father, his new wife and her daughters and, eventually, Danny’s wife and children. There is an epic feel to this novel but it is also an intimate portrait of siblings who have found home in each other when they are failed by the adults who were supposed to nurture them. Patchett is an incredible writer with very well developed characters that drive the story. Very well done and so very close to perfect."

 “We had made a fetish out of our misfortune, fallen in love with it.”
I have been listening to this book for over a month now and I am not sure if what I feel for the book is just mere attachment to something that has been around for a while or a more substantial liking. The Dutch House is a very intimate portrayal of the relationship between the Conroy siblings, Maeve and Danny, as narrated by the latter. A mother who left, an emotionally unavailable father, evil stepmother and an unexpected uprootal from everything they held as theirs bring the siblings closer, forging a strange relationship with the past in their young minds that manifests in various ways till the very end. At the center of it all stands the Dutch House, tall and majestic. It is where the story begins and it is where the story will find itself back, time and again. The narrative is mainly character-driven but the problem was that I just did not care enough about the characters. Danny was annoying and self-absorbed to say the least (even after being read by Tom Hanks!). Maeve was an assuring presence but beyond her lush black hair and a toxic obsession with the past, there was little to look forward to. Andrea, the stepmother, is the evil stepmother to the point where her entire personality is just being cruel and unreasonable. Character development is something our main characters do not relate to and even the little character development we do have is so random. What saved the book for me were the relationships explored in it. Even though Maeve and Danny weren't my favorite individuals, their bond was very personal and true. It is a very humane relationship with significant flaws but it was clear all the way till the very end that the two truly and fully felt at home only with each other. It was refreshing to read a book that was centered around siblinghood. I was also fond of Sandy and Jocelyn - the caretakers who practically raised Danny and Maeve - and the relationship they had with our main characters. Danny's daughter, May, is an absolute delight and I loved the scenes where she was there. However, I was very disappointed with the trajectory of Celeste, Danny's partner. She was initially presented as a quirky and interesting character but soon after her entire personality was around wanting Danny to marry her and ignoring Danny's shortcomings by blaming Maeve for it. I was not even remotely fond of the way the author created a trade-off between the time Danny could spend with Maeve and the time he could spend with Celeste. If this was all that was there, I might have given this book a 3.5 stars, but there are two significant plot holes that throw this down to the 2.5 star ditch. It made absolutely no sense that Cyril Conroy, a man who has been so meticulous his entire life, would leave his children with nothing but an education trust fund upon his death. He was more than aware of the fact that Andrea did not care for them and he was also training Danny to take over the company. He himself was not too fond of Andrea either. It is hard to believe that a shared admiration for the Dutch House and the business was enough for Mr. Conroy to make Andrea the partner of all his assets without any provision for the financial security of his children. And then we have the mother, Elma Conroy. She is absent as a real character through most of the book and then suddenly she drops in out of nowhere when Maeve is sick. She never even bothers to explain her disappearance or to even make the slightest attempt to get to know Danny, the little son she had abandoned. Yet, she claims to love him and somehow she is the one being punished. The only explanation given is something along the lines of 'she is by nature a saint and saints are not liked by their families'. And just when I thought that she was redeeming herself in earnest, she decides to be the caretaker for Andrea, despite hearing how adversely it would impact Maeve. I found her character poorly developed. Overall, it is a decent book. "
1184,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48646-melissa,Rating 5 out of 5,"It’s hard to tell others what this book is about without making it sound rather boring, but what’s remarkable about The Dutch House is that it’s unputdownable. The voice and characters are so vivid and my interest never waned. Even though it wasn’t hard to follow at all, when I was done, I went back to the beginning and read through the entire book again. I also love that this book made up for the type 1 diabetes inaccuracy that was in Bel Canto, which has the only occasion I can think of in a book where a character just has diabetes. She doesn’t die from it, it’s not the main thing about her, her getting diabetes isn’t even exactly a major plot point, beyond the people around here believing that Maeve’s loss of her mother had brought on the illness. The book mostly gets diabetes right. The only part where I didn’t think they exactly got it right was her going low at The Nutcracker, having a sugar of 38, eating glucose tablets and her eyes were clearing, and testing again and having a sugar of 42. Like, really? Glucose tabs brought her up 4 mg/dL and she’s feeling better? No way. Her sugar should have been, like, 72 when he tested her again. But whatever. It’s better than the musician in Bel Canto not having his insulin with him and letting himself die rather than taking the opportunity to go get the insulin then come back so he didn’t die, and instead dying what would have been a painful and horrific death. That was my least favorite part of Bel Canto. Dutch House was way better about diabetes and I’m curious what Ann Patchet’s experience with type 1 diabetes is.I only have two mild critiques. I didn’t like that, at the end when Danny is talking about his divorce from Celeste and how she didn’t want their house, that he reveals that he’d bought the house as a surprise gift for her, just like his father has bought the Dutch house for his mother, which was a wholly inappropriate gift for a woman who clearly believed that such largess was a sin, weighed against the poverty and suffering of others. How could Danny have made the exact same mistake? Yes, he’s like his father, but that was entirely too on-the-nose for me. And Danny, in his narration, fails to even put it together that this was the exact same thing his father did—how odd! Totally out of character. I also wish that we’d been given more with Andrea’s daughters and their relationship with Maeve so that the ending, when Bright is so thrilled to see Maeve again that she literally says something like, “I’ve missed you from the time you left until a few moments ago, when I saw you here.” I mean, that’s really intense. That’s some serious missing right there. Yes, Maeve was both kind to the girls and just a super cool person, but for me to buy that kind of missing, she would have had to fill some emotional need that Bright never got before and never got again. I didn’t see that, though. I just saw the old “cool babysitter/adoring kiddo” dynamic. Still, despite these small complaints that both came at the very end, great book. I’d kill for 1/10th of Ann Patchet’s talent and I will be reading all the rest of her books."
1185,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/104683913-sara-raquel,Rating 4 out of 5,"The dutch house tells the story of a family through the course of five decades. Cyril Conroy brings his family from poverty to wealth through his real estate empire. He buys a mansion, the dutch house, which will have a big impact on his wife and children. The story is told by the younger son, Danny. And what is especially remarkable throughout the book is his bond with his older sister, Maeve. They both admire and look out for each other in a beautiful way. Their closeness and open and sincere relationship was really what made me like the book and tear up. They help each other deal with their past, their fears, their regrets. I love reading about siblings dynamics and this one was probably the most beautiful and special one I have ever read about.I also loved Danny and Maeve's relationship with Fluffy, the nanny, Sandy, the housekeeper and Jocelyn, the cook.The story moves back and forth between the different timelines, which I found very interesting and worked very well with the story.It's a story about grief, family, resentments, sacrifice, nostalgia, childhood memories.I won't be giving it a full 5/5 rating because I thought it was slow paced and at the end I was a bit frustrated with one of the characters. I was also always expecting something exceptional to happen, like a twist. But it never did. I guess this isn't a book that is supposed to be plot-driven and exciting. Don't go into it expecting that. It's supposed to be character and emotion-driven. I think it's supposed to make you think and feel nostalgia.""But we overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we're not seeing it as the people we were, we're seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.""""There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you'd been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet in place, and for a moment you're suspended knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself.""""Like swallows, like salmon, we were the helpless captives of our migratory patterns. We pretended that what we has lost was the house, not our mother, not our father. We pretended that what we had lost has been taken from us by the person who still lived inside."""
1186,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29720345-jo-scho-reads,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Dutch House took me a little by surprise. I’d heard the great reviews so picked it up in the library and hung onto it for a while cause I wasn’t sure I’d like it, for some reason the cover put me off. Yet when I started reading it, to my delight I found I couldn’t stop. It’s essentially about two siblings; Danny Conroy and his older sister, Maeve. Together, they live in the Dutch House; a large and lavish house in Pennsylvania, with their father. It’s the 1950s, their mother is long gone and their father is often preoccupied and distant, so Danny and Maeve form a strong familial bond. They are always there for one another, despite the odds. When their father brings home Andrea, who eventually becomes his wife, Maeve and Danny are pushed out. Years pass by, circumstances change, life moves on, but somehow they are still drawn back to the Dutch House, like some invisible cord, never quite letting them go.I wouldn’t call this an uplifting book, I found it quite bleak at times often with a sense of foreboding - I was always waiting for bad things to happen when I turned the pages. But I was still completely and utterly absorbed in the story of Danny’s life. I love books that span decades, I find they aren’t as popular these days so when I get one I fall headfirst into it. This book is exquisitely well written and beautifully crafted. I loved the idea of a childhood home having so much significance and the memories that float there, like old ghosts. I adored the relationship between Danny and Maeve; their bond made me so envious for a sibling. And finally, I thought the plot was top notch. I’ve read a few reviews where the story has been criticised for the direction it took at the end - but I thought it was perfect. We are all so different with books and our opinions aren’t we? Oh and when I finished the book the significance of the cover it made total sense! Definitely one of my 2021 favourites, I need to read more by this author, that’s for sure."
1187,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30594990-maddie-lee,Rating 4 out of 5,"3.5 starsan inarguably beautifully book, i just don't think this kind of story is my cup of tea; the ending pushed me to round up to 4 stars in the end. pratchett is a wonderful storyteller, maybe this is just bc i thought tom hanks did a great job with the audiobook, but i loved the oral feel of this book, as though danny were sitting in a creaky rocking chair relaying the entire story to me with all the gift of retrospect. pratchett creates such lifelike characters and paints realistic portraits of everyone without sparing their flaws, yet still endearing them to you. you can't help but feel fond towards them even as they make questionable decisions. the dutch house is in itself a character, the descriptions are lovely and the weight of this building pulls all the characters down into its gravity. it feels a bit like the painting in The Goldfinch, in the way that it's not always present in the narrative but everything is inevitably linked to it somehow and it circles back to be all about the house in the end. i'm suspicious of it but i will credit pratchett for creating such a mesmerising building. her writing is incredibly evocative, though to be honest i'm not sure what emotion she evoked in me. i said that the ending pushed me to round up to 4 stars on goodreads, because towards the end i found myself getting gut-wrenchingly invested in the outcome of these characters lives. i picked up this book on the premise of ""a dark fairytale""; i mean yeah, i guess that's true, but i think i set my expectations askew by hanging the fairytale sign above it. the only reason i would give this book anything less than 5 stars is bc i just don't think sprawling family histories are in my particular interest, i thought it was excellently executed and i can recognise that while also acknowledging that it's not getting a spot on my top shelves. "
1188,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29368822-natassa,Rating 5 out of 5,"This was perfection? 5/5 stars? A slow paced, yet absorbing read? I'm so so pleasantly surprised.Not having read any Ann Patchett before, I didn't know what I was getting myself into when I bought this one, only that people I follow on social media had been enjoying it. Sometimes it only takes someone whose tastes you admire praising a book for you to convince yourself you will love it, and yet I didn't expect myself loving it THIS much. And it wasn't even the racing hearts, squeal-emitting type of read I'm used to when I end up calling a book a favorite. It was a slow burn, time consuming, quiet type of experience, and that is what made me adore it.Stretching out over five-ish decades, we get to follow two siblings as their lives move further away from the Dutch House, the place they grew up in and had to eventually leave. But just because they're not physically there it doesn't mean their minds aren't constantly returning to it. With this slight obsession, their strong bond, the way we move back and forth in time, and the historical aspects, this was a highly enjoyable read. I found the narration familiar, and yet I can't explain why. It was like coming home, each time I picked it up. Knowing I would get a calm moment as I watched these siblings' lives unfold (despite their lives being anything but calm). I don't know how to explain it, but I was never bored, never restless, always engaged. The slow pace only worked in its favor. It was just over 300 pages and yet it almost rivals my experience of reading The Goldfinch (which took me months). I was reading it for about a week and yet it feels like I just lived a whole life with these characters, it was amazing.Do I want to read everything Ann Patchett has written now? You can bet your ass I do."

It is rated as an audiobook as I did not read the novel. He did great voice inflections and even when he announced each chapter. He is the narrator of Danny, the second child. He talks about their dysfunctional family how they acquire this house (mansion) in Elkins Park near Philadelphia. How his mother hated it and left them. Eventually his dad married a wicked stepmom, Andrea. Who as the story goes along u despise her for practically throwing her step kids out and being incredibly selfish when their father died unexpectedly at 53. I am from Bocks County pa area originally so know all the towns they talked about. Horsham PA was near me too. The book has a hold on you and you need to know how Maeve and Danny's lives enfold. Danny talks about their feelings and sitting on the car with his sister looking at the house they no longer own or live in thanks to their deceptive stepmom. Danny likes his step sisters though. The book goes through the decades and you find both characters a little complexed perhaps with their childhood. Their mother left them, their father was hugely absent. Their is a closeness to Maeve and Danny and sometimes u understand feelings of both children. Maeve has many medical scares. There was also humor in this book. Their mother shows up and their are different feelings each child feels about this. The book shows a strong bond between siblings, forgiveness, compassion and strength.I give this a 5 as an audiobook. Will read the book in future to see if that is the same. If u get a chance though do it as an Audi as Tom Hanks makes these characters seem real."

Doch als er von seinem hart erarbeiteten, ersten kleinen Vermögen das hinreißende Holländerhaus kauft, zerbricht seine Welt: Seine Frau erträgt den Luxus nicht und geht. Ein Schock für die beiden Kinder, und Tochter Maeve muss die Mutterrolle für ihren jüngeren Bruder Dave übernehmen. Die Geschwister werden unzertrennlich und sind eigentlich glücklich – bis Cyril wieder heiratet. Die Neue hat zwei eigene kleine Mädchen, denen sie, ganz böse Stiefmutter, das Erbe sichern will, vor allem aber das Holländerhaus ... Aus einer Geschichte, so alt wie das epische Erzählen, wird bei Ann Patchett ein facettenreicher, kluger und ganz und gar moderner Familienroman der Meisterklasse.MeinungDas Buch ist aus der Sicht von Danny als Ich Erzähler geschrieben. Wir steigen ein als Danny acht Jahre alt ist und sein Vater nach dem Weggang der Mutter, zum ersten mal eine Frau ins Holländerhaus bringt. Danny erzählt die Geschichte des Hauses und iher Bewohner, dabei springt er in der Zeit hin und her. Besonders zu Maeve seiner 7 Jahre älteren Schwester hat er ein inniges Verhältnis. Diese ist auch ein sehr großer Bestandteil der Handlung. Das Holländerhaus spielt im Leben der Geschwister immer eine wichtige Rolle, obwohl sie nur kurze Zeit darin gelebt haben. FazitLeider konnte ich nicht so richtig warm mit der Geschichte werden. Ich fand sie stellenweise fade. Der Einstieg fiel mir schwer. Das lag daran das der Geschichte die Wärme fehlte, obwohl Potenzial da gewesen wäre. Die idee an sich war gut, sie wurde nur zu kalt, distanziert erzählt. Es fehlte ihr einfach an Leben.ein modernes Märchen dem man hätte mehr Emotionen angedeihen lassen müssen."

Maeve and Danny Conroy are siblings who live in the Dutch House, an obscenely extravagant mansion built in the early 1920s, an architectural marvel rivaling Versailles, a house that's a sign of pride for their father, and of guilt and vulgar wealth for their mother. Soon, the mother goes out of the picture and their father brings in Andrea, a woman who sees the house as something worthy of her stature and possession. Andrea does something that sets the plot rolling and the repercussions reverberate beyond the last page of the book.Does our past ever leave us? Or does it loom like an omnipresent entity, forever dictating our desires and actions? Do we outgrow our childhood wounds or do we keep searching for ways to heal them as adults? Is closure ever possible? Are we doomed to live and re-live our parents' mistakes, an exercise in irony that spans bloodlines? The book takes on such ideas and weaves it into its subtle storytelling.That's one of the things that I loved about this book. Outside of the ridiculous opulence of the house, everything else was understated and subtle - the characters, the dialogue, the pacing, the conclusion. Hidden between the deceptive simplicity of the prose were observations on life and living. And it's so relatable! Haven't we all done that? Both - hoped that one day we'd let go of the past that haunts us and also scraped and scratched the scabs till they bled again? And somewhere in between, we find time to grow up and find careers and make families and live out lives.Maeve Conroy, as a character, was somebody I related to a great deal. This was my first Ann Patchett book. My push to read her was her brilliant essay in Harper's magazine 'These Precious Days' (check that out, please!). And I'm sure I'll wind my way through her oeuvre slowly."

Patchett is a genius when it comes to explicating messy, nuanced, beautiful, and not so beautiful intergenerational relationships -- between children and their parents and their step-parents and their parents' friends who knew them first and longer and in ways the children never will. She did the same thing in 
Commonwealth
 (a book I loved and want to reread). How can we understand the choices our parents made when they were young when we can't fully understand the people they were when they made those choices? How can we forgive them? How can they forgive themselves? And, more importantly, how can we be fair, objective narrators of our own lives? (We can't.)Patchett covers a lot of ground in The Dutch House (and does so beautifully) but doesn't break any. The distant father, the evil stepmother/gold digger, the sister who takes on the mothering role, the jealous wife -- these portraits are fully realized in this novel. I'm just not sure anything new is being said. What's most interesting, of course, is the eyes through which all these characters are being sketched. Any analysis/discussion of this novel must center on that: Danny and why he thinks the way he does. (I'm not sure every reader will view it that way though.)Tom Hanks's narration is brilliant. I even went to see what other books he's narrated so I could listen to them, too, but this is pretty much the first one."

Each page and each chapter is layer upon layer which are forming a story that I can’t quite properly express as how I fell about it, but comes down to being ‘rich/full’ in a way, even though it's not a happy story perse. I was really emotional when finishing this book, which I wasn’t expecting anymore to be honest after having read Part 1 & 2 but somehow, the last part of this book, it’s divided into 3 parts, was just a perfect conclusion and made me 'feel' everything all of a sudden, that was building up to that point, which was a bit overwhelming even. Suddenly it clicked and BAM. Looking back on this read, it’s one that I liked in general right away though, because the writing by the author is just incredibly beautiful and had me constantly wanting more. But it was also a story that took time to really sink in and well... The further along I got, the more I 'saw and felt' this story unraveling, in the best ways possible. It’s not always nice but it has its beautiful and more uplifting moments. It’s not action packed, it’s not plot twist focused; It’s a story about family in its core and it comes with loss, anger, sadness, doing penance but also redemption and forgiveness. It’s raw, pure and real; it’s the way of life. Incredibly well done by the author.A book that’ll linger with me for a while to come, a story that I only truly came to appreciate in its fullest now that I’ve read it in its entirety."
1194,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/74793983-nancy-schek,Rating 4 out of 5,"I'm not sure what i think of this book. It's been popular in my area because the story is set mainly in Elkins Park, the town which directly neighbors my community of Melrose Park. The story revolves around a sister Maeve and brother Danny, who grow up in a mansion that formerly belonged to a very wealthy family. Without giving away details, their family falls apart, and the siblings must rely on each other as they go through life, and they love each other fiercely. Danny narrates the story; and along with the reader, he discovers and comes to understand his family's history, little by little, throughout the book. In fact, he and Maeve are obsessed by their family's history and they constantly try to build a coherent story for themselves. Some other characters are their parents, their father's second wife and children, three women who work for the family, plus Danny's eventual wife and two children. There is an intense focus on all of the relationships which feel very ""real."" Two problems i have with the book are: 1) the setting didn't ""ring true"" to me, even though i've lived in the Elkins Park area for a long time. However, the time period was earlier, with the family moving there in 1946. Nevertheless, while a real town was chosen so deliberately for the setting, there is not much of the real town portrayed other than its name. 2) Maeve has type 1 diabetes with seemingly no other chronic health problems until her late 40's. This is pretty unrealistic, based on the state of care for diabetics in those earlier days.The book had some slow segments, but all-in-all it held my interest. I found myself caring about the characters in much the same way that Danny does. Also - I love Maeve's portrait on the book cover and the portrait's place in the story."

In jest, my friend knows how much I ""READ"" books and said, ""unless you have audible, Tom Hanks narrates this story and...."" ~SOLD~This is the story of (appropriately named) The Dutch House. Or rather, the people who live in, leave and return to the Dutch House.We all have memories of where we grew up. Siblings Maeve and Danny are obsessed with the Dutch house (or maybe just Maeve including Danny). Their step mother was equally as obsessed. But what makes them obsessed is the entire premise of the story. It is also about family and how we need to work to overcome anger, learn from mistakes and forgive each other. For example, the adult children had to find it within themselves to forgive the mother, who left them at a young age, alone with their father to move to India. It's about the people in our lives who look out for us that become family. This author has found a unique take on lives that are all too easy to relate to...but in the audio, Tom Hanks narrates!!!!One of my favorite parts throughout this read that made me laugh is the fact that every time Maeve and Danny went to ""stalk"" the house, they ended up smoking. They each thought the other had quit!!Whether you read or listen to the book, I wholeheartedly recommend it! The storyline flows well and the characters are relatable (lovable and hatable). It's funny, sad and thought provoking.100% Enjoyable!!"

I've been seeing Bel Canto in bookstores but never felt the urge to pick it up until my husband showed me an article of an interview with Ann Patchett which instantly made me curious about her. The Dutch House caught my interest mainly because of the intriguing cover and of course, because the blurb felt like something I'd really love (family intrigue, why not?). Several chapters in and I immediately realized that Ann Patchett's writing is something to be savored slowly. She's an amazing storyteller, weaving the past and the present deftly, reserving powerful revelations towards the end. There are no wasted scenes, everything on the pages, even those which I thought were trivial, were actually relevant to the story as a whole.Ann Patchett, as I've discovered, is known for her richly drawn characters, and this is very much obvious in The Dutch House. I loved Danny and Maeve, even the seemingly unlikeable Celeste. I loved the thoughtful dialogues. Most of all, I love it that this book is more show than tell. It left me with a lot of thoughts to process. I'll definitely be picking up another Ann Patchett book soon.4/5 stars. 06.29.2021"

I’m still gathering my thoughts on this book, but: - She writes siblings so intensely well: here how deeply known and unknown they are to us at the same time. I loved to watch Maeve and Danny root for each other across time, and I loved to see how they dealt with such different reactions to the same events. - I liked how we mostly tracked chronological time, and I liked adult Danny’s perspective on younger Danny, occasionally getting a knowing voice commenting on a teenager. - Another thing I really appreciated was how authentic this book was to its place. It’s a pet peeve of mine when authors pick a setting for a book and don’t know it very well, but I was pleasantly surprised to find out this story takes place nearby and rang true (except for how often people drove from Jenkintown to Harlem…. Maybe it’s different today?). I love a Philly-adjacent story. About to do some googling and see if the Dutch House is real and if I can go see it.- I didn’t love the twists in the second half; they felt a little contrived in order for the story to reach a predetermined endpoint, but I loved Maeve and Danny enough anyway. - I found it truly flabbergasting to watch Danny repeat some of his father’s biggest mistakes, but loved how the author convincingly made them Danny’s own, too. Such strong genes in this family!- This is a really lovely cover, and I extra appreciate that it’s a painting original to the book."

Patchett explores issues of forgiveness and reconciliation in this tale of a seemingly distant and detached patriarch (Cyril Conroy) and his wife, who apparently fled the stately family home (The Dutch House) in the tony 'burbs of Philadelphia to work for Mother Teresa (or someone like her) in India, never to be heard from again (or so it seems). The couple's adolescent daughter Maeve and young son Danny basically raise themselves under the watchful eye of the housekeeper, nanny, and cook. Enter the ""wicked stepmother."" Cyril remarries. Andrea is a cold-hearted gold-digger with two children of her own. The story pivots when Cyril dies and Andrea literally sends Maeve and Danny packing with just the clothes on their back and little or no financial resources. From riches to rags. How will they fare?

It deals with the complex subject of motherhood and includes a biological mother who left her children in order to participate in charitable and community service initiatives, a stepmother who adopts her typical role, maids who are an important part of the upbringing, and a child who is forced to fill the role of a mother far too early in life. Mothers were the measure of safety, which meant that I was safer than Maeve. After our mother left, Maeve took up the job on my behalf but no one did the same for her.It also focuses on how we have a fixation on the past and dwell on the pleasant memories of bygone eras in the hope that the glorious eras will come back. But we overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.The quote where one of the kids realizes how they had been grieving the loss of the material things like their house more than the loss of their childhood in the wake of their parents' passing and absence was probably my favorite of all the quotes.Like swallows, like salmon, we were the helpless captives of our migratory patterns. We pretended that what we has lost was the house, not our mother, not our father."
1200,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"Ann Patchett does not disappoint--her writing is beautiful and it carried me quickly through this story of two siblings, Maeve and Danny, written from the first person of Danny. Patchett writing in a male voice rings true. A lyrical exploration of a family-a messy and dysfunctional family but one that has at its core an unbreakable sibling bond. The book addresses blended families, abandoned children, marriage, motherhood, nurturing, finding one's path in life. At all times it rang true. The story covers their time in the Dutch House, the magnificent yet flea ridden and overwhelming mansion their father bought and their eviction. The siblings spend decades watching Dutch House, but never approaching it. Maeve and Danny have been abandoned and forgotten by crucial adults in their lives, yet at the same time other adults have fierce attachment to them. Their connection is paramount. Knowing that Patchett is married to a physician, I found the sub-plot of the son who becomes a physician but never practices, interesting. Although the story comes full circle, it did not feel contrived in any way, as the characters have grown and revealed themselves. I found it a book that resonated and the characters are fully explored. And a pleasure to read."

Since then they visit the house from time to time reminiscing about the old days. We follow them through Danny's perspective throughout their childhoods until old age and even death. It took me a while to get into the story, because I didn't connect with Danny, especially because he can be rather pretentious and some things he says considering women were irritating:I did not ask my father about women. Not women in general an what you were supposed to do with them.  Women are not objects you can do things with. What I did like, though, is the theme of 'moving-on'. Moving on from the past, from the hurt and from the negative feelings bound with the past. Both, Maeve and Danny, are well into adulthood until they can leave the Dutch House and it's habitants behind and move forwards with their lives. Holding onto hate does more harm than good, which both of them come soon to realize. Even though, their lives weren't easy and they had to go through some hardships, they managed to evolve into better people, find their way and move forward with their lives.

Hearing the familiar inflection in his narration conjured up all the warm fuzzies I associate with my fave Hanks films and appearances. So, already, I was feeling like I was going to enjoy ANYTHING he was going to tell me. - the book itself - the book was ok, a very interesting story told from the POV of a younger brother obviously devoted to his nurturing older sister. The book was really their story as siblings navigating the world on their own, with the Dutch House being a cool backdrop for how they grew up and viewed the world around them. A slow burn of a book, nothing really monumental happened, no epic peaks and denouements, but a steady paced novel that told a simple story. It was alright, but I think if I had read it rather than listened to Tom read it to me, I would have given it a lower rating. "

On the 5 star side, I have to give Patchett credit for masterfully telling a 60+ year multigenerational family story in about 330 pages. Every single word is important and impressively linked to all the other words. I truly appreciated the writing. But...I didn't enjoy it at all. It's the book version of melancholia or ennui. I didn't like a single character, but I also didn't hate them. I didn't feel enough about them or the house to spark any emotion. I also didn't like who I was while reading it, finding I spent a lot of time judging the characters for things they did or didn't do. Was Patchett's intention to help us reveal some of our own biases? Something to think about, but I'm not sure I want to give the book that much belated attention or credit. This is definitely an ""it's me not you"" situation as every single person I know who's read this has loved it - including the person who gifted it to me. "

I think the setting had a lot to do with my preference; I am always a fan of stories revolving around odd houses that seem to have a life of their own, reaching out to mysteriously impact the characters in subtle ways. I think Ann Patchett very skillfully gave life to this setting and made the Dutch House a character almost as much as Danny, Maeve, Andrea, and the others. I do, however, think that it was missing something. While I was incredibly invested in each of the characters, and raged and cried at Patchett's cues, I still closed this book with the feeling that it was both too short and too long. Too short, because it seemed everything happened quickly and with no real sense of time; too long, because if it had gone on for any more pages it would have become tiresome. Still, I devoured this book and I held on to the sense of doom and mystery that followed each of its characters. It was essentially a tale about privilege, and I think this theme was excellently crafted.I say, skip Bel Canto and dive right in to The Dutch House instead. "

The Dutch House is a character driven storyline, following the lives of siblings Danny and Maeve from childhood on. I can often get bored by a slower, character driven plot, but I got so caught up in the authors beautiful writing that I didn’t pay much attention to the slower paced plot line. One thing I do always love about these types of books is that you really get to know the characters, their thought processes and emotions, and feel deeply connected to them.This is also the first time I’ve done a mix of print and audiobook and I really enjoyed reading that way. Of course I had to listen to some of the audio because Tom Hanks could read the phone book and it would be soothing to listen to. Needless to say, his narration was fantastic. I had trouble with the nonlinear timeline on occasion, but other times it worked well.

I liked the story. I liked everything about it, except, it just didn't move me. I didn't like the characters. I wanted them to be better, do better, live better. I was so frustrated that Danny spent all of those years in school, not because he wanted to, but as revenge against his step-mother. Such a waste. The writing was amazing (5 stars!) and there are so many good quotes, that I find myself thinking about those words more than than the story.Favorite quotes: (this last three might be because I read this in March, just after ""shelter-in-place"" orders came down.)There is a finite amount of time.

I've only heard good things about The Dutch House and Ann Patchett, not to mention Tom Hanks' performance of the audio (which was, indeed, great). But I really disliked all of the characters, and that makes it really hard for me to enjoy a book. The other thing that didn't work for me was the setting of the Dutch house. A few of the reviews I read mentioned how it acted as a character itself, but I didn't find that to be true. Instead, I felt the house could have been removed from the story and very little would have been changed. I read it as more of a character study in relationships, especially as a result of some type of loss. Danny and Maeve's relationship evolved after the loss of their mother, then again after the loss of their father, and once more after the loss of their stepmother. All different losses with varying effects on the siblings. I'm giving The Dutch House 4 stars because the writing was excellent, the story was interesting enough, and I would still pick up another Ann Patchett with the hope of finding one that resonates more with me."

Instead, it's a much more contained look at two siblings and their unbreakable bond. And it's beautiful. We have Danny, who is vaguely insufferable, and his older sister Maeve, who I would probably fall in love with if she were real. Danny, with all his vague insufferableness, is the narrator of this story, and while I wondered whether the novel would have been better if Maeve had narrated it while I was reading it, I think now that Danny probably had to be the narrator. He has a necessary amount of distance from certain aspects of the story—his absent mother, his detached yet still sometimes loving father, and the titular Dutch House he grew up in—that we as readers get to learn alongside him. This is beautifully written, and while I have some complaints about how some of the flashbacks are set up more toward the middle and end of the novel, it's kind of amazing that this book is only 340 pages long. It feels longer, and that's a testament to Patchett's ability to tell this story with precision and love. I enjoyed this, and appreciate the essay that Patchett wrote that lead me to want to read The Dutch House. If you haven't already, I highly recommend ""These Precious Days,"" which is mostly about her friendship with the artist Sooki Raphael, which blossomed during the beginning of the pandemic. Patchett also talks a little bit about her process in writing this novel. (I wish I had read it after I finished the book, but alas.) https://harpers.org/archive/2021/01/t..."

He does an excellent job narrating this book. But it is mainly the story line and characters of Danny and Maeve that will stay with me for awhile. I love how Danny can be so insightful about some things and so obtuse about others...just like the rest of us. One that stands out for me is when Maeve and Danny are standing outside looking at the gutter on her house (so they can have a private moment) and Maeve brought him to task on a behavior of his. He thinks for a moment and says ""and of course she was right...so I changed."" And that, to me, is the story of life. You go along thinking you know how things are and you behave accordingly. Then something shakes up your world or enlightens you, you see that you are wrong, and you change your behavior accordingly.

To me, the book is really about Maeve, who is a singularly wonderful character. I wanted the book to be from her perspective, not Danny's. But now that I've read this book, from Danny's perspective, I want Patchett to write the same story from the perspective of Maeve, and then from the perspective of Celeste, and then from the perspective of Andrea. There's so much to explore here that went unexplored, which is my one minor quibble. This book is not particularly uplifting, but it does deftly explore all the many ways in which families either hurt or sustain each other (and sometimes both).Unrelated to the text: I make a motion to have Tom Hanks read every single audiobook ever published from here on out (except for the ones read by Bahni Turpin, who gets first dibs).

1212,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"Friends, please read this beautiful book. I loved the characters, I loved the setting, I loved the struggles, I loved the way it coped with family dynamics. It was so wonderful and so poignant and so thought-provoking. Plus it's under 350 pages - it can be done! You can write a packed and meaningful story in less than 400 pages. The main theme in this book is being stuck and the difficulty of getting un-stuck so you can move on with your damn life. I feel this so hard. Things happen to us that shape the people we become and we hold onto that past so hard because it defines who we are. And then when confronted with the idea that other people surrounding us experienced those same events differently and their truth is different is hard. Am I making any sense? What I'm trying to say is this book gave me a lot to think about and a lot to learn from and I can't wait to read it again. 5*."
1213,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13056357-artemisia-hunt,Rating 5 out of 5,"One of the most memorable and fascinating multi-generational family sagas I've read in a long time, The Dutch House is peopled with a diverse cast of multi-faceted characters and a house that could probably be called a kind of character itself. Particularly well-developed was the sibling relationship between Maeve and Danny and their interaction is one of the things that makes this novel so good. (Between her last book Commonwealth and this one, you could certainly make a case that Ann Patchett has become a contemporary master of creating and writing about sibling bonds.) Add in the elements of a fairytale: an amazing ""castle"", a 2nd wife that easily fits the ""evil stepmother"" archetype and two ""poor orphans"" banished from the castle, and the whole storyline becomes poignant and heartbreaking at times, but also tinged with a beautiful nostalgia and a sense of redemption. Although this redemption is not at the hands of some fairy godmother, but due to the pluck and determination of the resilient Danny and Maeve. Having read pretty much every published word that Ann Patchett has written, this exquisite novel would definitely be my pick as her masterpiece. And before I'm finished raving about The Dutch House, I can't say enough about Tom Hanks superb audiobook reading of this novel. He didn't just read the book, he fully embodied the character of Danny, the narrator and protagonist."

Unfortunately Danny is not so lovely- he is oblivious to other, indulged by all the women in his life but loves Maeve fiercely. This quiet book is a character study of the Conroy family who struggle with loss and forgiveness. At first I thought the title didn't reflect the book, but as the story has stayed with me, it is a picture of this family with all its quirkiness. By now, I am impressed with the writing style of Ms. Patchett. She takes everyday situations that allow us to pause and reflect. Whilst this one may not be as sublime as State of Wonder, it still is beautiful in its own quiet way. At first I too was underwhelmed with the story, but as I let the story fester a bit and by reading other stories with themes about family and secrets, it still is able to shine. Just not as brightly as other stories I have read in 2021 thus far. "

Ann Patchett's writing is divine.Really, I thought that this was going to be like watching a train wreck as a family dissolves before your eyes, but it turned out to be something so much more.... The power of family ..... the importance of connection ..... how life can turn in circles ..... how one person sees the world through their experiences versus another who has almost the same ones, and how different they can be. But mostly it's about the beauty from within and how that makes a family rock, regardless of the state of the home and how imperfect it seems to be. I really am not doing this book justice at all. The writing was so smooth and silky, like running your hand through a baby's hair or running it over velvet. Her phrasing was exactly perfect - succinctly summing a feeling or a thought that it hitched my breath more than once. It was wonderful. "

История о жизни семьи, о том, как один и тот же дом по-разному отразился на судьбах всех тех, кто когда - либо жил или бывал в этом доме. Все герои надломлены, со своими тараканами, но вместо того, чтобы остаться лицом к лицу со своими проблемами, комплексами и сосредоточиться на их решениях, герои тупо хватаюся за обиды, за прошлое, за чувство мести и сваливают свою беду на дом... 🤯Не убедила меня книга, не поверила я в высший альтруизм и предназначение матери, одной из героинь, чей поступок изменил жизни многих.

Maeve and Danny have been abandoned by their mom and they ended up spending their childhood with their dad in the Dutch House. This House ended up become part of their identity, even though they ended up getting thrown out of it by their mother-in-law after their dad died. I felt so endeared by the close relationship of siblings Maeve and Danny. How they grew up and their lives didn't prevent from staying close and not being able to live without the other in their life. This book is the story of everyone 's life and how things happen and you either hold a grudge or decide to let go and forgive. A book I will definitely read again as it helped me see things in a different perspective in my own life. Ann Patchett is a genius author."

It follows the lives of Danny and Maeve as they grow up in a dysfunctional family and of course...in the titular ""dutch house."" Although Danny and Maeve physically leave the house, they are continually drawn back to it.The book shines in its character development and description of complex family relationships. I really liked and cheered for some of them (Maeve) and hated others (Andrea, and even Elna). The description of the house also was wonderful: the history of the people who had lived there and each of the rooms and charm. I could picture myself sitting in Maeve's room with the large window.This falls short of a five star review because there really isn't an exciting and thrilling plot making me turn each page. If that is what you want, possibly pass on this. However, if you are intrigued by a well written book about dynamic relationships, then give it a try."

I suspected Ann Patchett of being a wonderful novelist, but I didn’t expect her to floor me in this way. Her gentle way around her characters made them feel so incredibly real that I wanted to visit the Dutch House myself. It is a novel where not much happens besides life that happens, and it is made for readers who can’t get enough of exactly that. This family, Danny and Maeve, and how they cling to each other in the storm of their lives.Tom Hanks in Danny’s voice is as compelling as it is evocative, and I hung on to every word. And Maeve. What a woman, and she’s not even real. I feel as though I know her as well as I would a best friend. She is an eldest daughter through and through, and I hold her story so dear to me.Easily one of my new favorites."

It felt simple, and yet the execution felt masterful. Jumping decades between timelines in the lives of a brother and sister, this is a story of family, loss, guilt, obligation, the ways life traps you and surprises you. There’s nothing BIG or WOWING in this novel, and yet it is powerful in the mundane. It ebbs and flows the way life ebbs and flows, and somehow Prachett makes it all so interesting. I listened to the audiobook of this one along with the physical book. I have to say, I was excited for Tom Hanks narration...but ended up not really loving it. It was somehow TOO Tom Hanks. It lacked the voices and variation of a skilled audiobook narrator. Still good, but not great. "

It touches on the memories of childhood, it is about acceptance and forgiveness, relationships and human complexities. I fell in love with the gorgeous cover (naturally), the writing (Ann Patchett writes beautifully) and the well-written characters. THE house itself is a main character in this story. I mean, of course it is! Hence the title 😁The dynamic between Maeve and Danny was my favourite part of the book."

Patchett’s writing is so rich with detail that you lose yourself in her descriptions of both setting and characters. Danny, Maeve, Andrea, Sandy- every single character felt three dimensional and oh so real. I empathized with them. I vehemently disagreed. I hated them. Any writing that can evoke such strong emotions in the reader wins in my book. This book was narrated from Danny’s perspective and follows him from childhood into adulthood. Chapters jump around frequently and the timeline is nonlinear. Normally, this would bother me, but Patchett used this structure to great effect. It felt as though Danny was telling me a story or having a conversation in which the telling of the various events of his life arise organically instead of in a scripted or linear fashion. This work was truly a marvel and an ode to sibling-ships. I was sad to finish it and leave Danny and Maeve behind. "

What was even better was getting it on Audible read by Tom Hanks. His narration added such an extra layer of richness to the book that passages made me ache with emotion, cry, laugh, be shocked. I'm not going to give a way the story but it tells of a family who live in the Dutch House ( named for the Dutch people who built it) and how the house is woven around their lives even after individuals no longer live inside. It is a tale of loss, grief, abandonment, marriage and childhood. I loved it and may very well reread it as I felt so sad to have reached the end today. There were times when I was genuinely shocked by the actions of individual characters, the consequences of those actions and the all out for everyone. The lack of compassion, the empathy and the love shown from even minor characters show tremendous maturity from Patchett. Once you've read it you will understand how rich and layered this wonderful novel is and the writing from Patchett shows she is absolutely at the top of her game now. Looking forward to her next, whenever that may be."
1224,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Dutch House is the story of siblings Danny and Maeve Conroy. Their father Cyril bought the Dutch House for his wife without her seeing the house pre-purchase. Ann Patchett has given us some detail about the house but not too much, leaving us to imagine what the house might look like. Danny and Maeve's mother Elna leaves her husband when the children are young and Cyril eventually strikes up a relationship with Andrea (the evil stepmother). Andrea moves into the home with her two daughters, Norma and Bright, and when Cyril passes away, she asks Danny and Maeve to move out. For a number of years Danny and Maeve park across the road from the house and reminisce about their childhood. The novel spans a number of decades and there was great character development which I always love. I found it hard to put down, it was a great read."
1225,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34430514-rae,Rating 4 out of 5,"A novel written by best-selling author Ann Patchett, narrated by my favourite actor, Tom Hanks - who could resist such a stellar combo? From the outset the title sets us firmly withinthe Dutch House, a sprawling, stately, slightly ghoulish mansion nestled in the suburbs of Philadelphia. But for young Danny Conroy and his elder sister Maeve, it is the place they grow up and call home. We then follow them through the next five decades, exploring their relationship with the property and why they find it impossible to let go. It’s a slow burn of a novel, examining sibling relationships and family ties, insecurities and resentments that linger long after childhood. It’s a family saga that weaves back and forth in time, until eventually we understand why the players play the parts they do. Hanks is superb as narrator, as he captures Danny’s personality perfectly. Let’s hope the duo of Patchett and Hanks get together again soon."

It’s a complicated story of a brother and sister growing up in the Dutch House in an elite suburb of Philadelphia in the fifties. The story takes place over a forty year time span. Danny and Maeve are uncommonly close growing up and remain so even into adulthood. They make decisions that are really not in their own best interests, mostly from a sense of having been cheated out of an inheritance that they thought was owed to them. Ultimately, this is a story of the American Dream gone awry, set into motion by their father, who believes that you can work your way up from poverty, insure your children’s good education, and ultimately buy happiness. As I previously stated, it’s a complicated story and was worth every minute of my listening time. An exceptional novel!"

Always like when you get to follow a child growing up, as the tone, pace, and focus change with age.Nice to see that Patchett wasn't in any rush to tell the story, as the pace was calm but never boring. This allowed for the blurriness of the recounted memories to become visible, and for the reader, it was compelling to follow such detailed descriptions of fragments. The narrative never felt fuzzy or disorientating despite the jumps in time.The house is its own character, not really given a voice, but pressing on every other characters' existence. It tells of how inherited privilege can become a heavy burden, a perspective that lets you in on (yeah I'm saying this) the struggles the rich are faced with when greed takes over."

Misschien is het het feit dat ik snel uitgekeken ben op boeken. Maar ik vond het eigenlijk heel saai. Ik vond dat er niet echt een hoogtepunt kwam in het boek. Pas de laatste paar hoofdstukken kwam er een beetje vaart in, maar de rest van het boek was niet zo heel bijzonder en vond ik een beetje van de hak op de tak gaan (ik mag niks zeggen, dat gebeurt ook in deze review).Ondanks dat is het wel een boek die me bij is gebleven. Ik onthield alle karakters en daar ben ik normaal echt the worst in. Ik wilde doorlezen omdat ik wilde weten wat er met het Hollandse Huis zou gebeuren, wat op zich ook wel een goed teken is.

She often writes about the complexity of family life and relationships, in a realistic but ultimately optimistic way. This story had a somewhat evil stepmother and parents who were emotionally remote from the narrator and his sister. This had significant consequences on both of the siblings’ lives. The story was completely absorbing to me, a perfect vacation read that left me contemplating forgiveness and selfless acts of generosity toward others."

I viewed it as a novel about the relationship between a brother and a sister -- others might differ, but that's what stood out for me. Their childhood was initially problematic, and it became truly horrendous. But they stood by each other and grew into competent adults, always reflecting on how their childhood affected them, symbolized by the house they lived in through childhood, the eponymous Dutch House.This is a WONDERFUL story about relationships -- not just the brother and sister, but the women servants in their household, their step-sisters, the brother's spouse, the sister's employer... all of them lovely, flawed people who are trying.When I finished it, I gave it to my brother.

One’s home is almost as much a part of your narrative as anything else in your life. The “Dutch House” as it’s referred to by the Conroy family, is the place where siblings Danny and Maeve’s story begins and holds such a big piece of their history which they cannot let go of. There are so many things about this book that will pull you in and keep you reading.

Very briefly, the Dutch House is a very beautiful mansion just outside Philadelphia which Cyril Conroy buys for his wife. However, she hates it, and goes away, leaving her two children, Maeve and Danny, to be raised by the help, Fluffy, Sandy and Jocelyn. Mr Conroy is busy with his construction company, which Danny hopes to follow him into. Then enter the wicked stepmother. Andrea Smith moves in on Mr Conroy, he marries her, and that is when the trouble started. I really can’t say more as it would involve spoilers, except to say the portrait on the cover of the book is of Maeve, age ten.

After reading two of Patchett’s stories now, I’m starting to see a pattern to her writing that I don’t completely love. At the beginning of her stories I’m so sucked in and invested I feel like it’s a 5 star worthy, outstanding book. Then she looses me at some points and my interest wanes because she tends to drag on a bit too long about mundane detail. Right when I find myself skimming though, the story will pick back up and I become invested again. Also, her tone always feels pretty formal and cool, and I feel like I’m hanging out with a friend who has a wall up and won’t quite let me in. But this friend is also really intelligent and so in tune to the nuances of human behavior that you want to continue spending time with them to learn more. Overall I think this story is worth a read, and I will continue to read other books by her, but I’ll just go into them knowing it won’t be one of my favorites, and that’s okay, because I appreciate the good moments."

I would have been so much more interested in a perspective from the evil stepmother or stepsisters, what about the mother that abandoned her kids? I don't want to read stories about grand houses anymore - like the Dutch House they are lonely and hanging portraits of dead people we don't care about."

Maeve is surely one of the most wonderful sisters in literature and Andrea the most purely evil stepmonster outside of the realm of fairytale. And yet there is no reductiveness to any of the characterisations, the dialogue is perfectly attuned to the rhythms of family and power, the devastating emotional terrain she charts is tender and never manipulative.

I just loved it, it’s a big ol’ American novel, very cinematic in its description, I felt drawn on and on, not wanting to put it down at the end of each chapter. The characters are fully realised and I do love a novel that covers such a huge expanse of time in such a clever way. I don’t really know what else to say, I loved it. "

Luckily, I didn't have to. Along with a hardback copy, I had the audiobook checked out through Libby. So, in the evenings, I'd read my copy, and during the day, during my commute or doing the dishes, Tom Hanks read it to me. Maeve and Danny were so fully sketched and developed, they walked right off the page. And it's been a long time since one specific location, one specific home, felt so fully alive. The Dutch House was not only a physical space, but was a symbol of inheritance and the complexity of both wanting our parents and wanting to be everything they were not. The Dutch House is not a real place, but Patchett made it so."

All the characters are realistically flawed which propels the story forward and lends to the mystery of why the mom and dad made the strange choices they did. I never felt a strong attachment to the parents and the way The Dutch House effects those choices is a little far-fetched to me... I mean, it's just a house!I have fond memories of my childhood home and would love to walk through its walls today to see how it's been changed but it is an inanimate object and doesn't control the course of my life. I guess, the slight irrationality of these characters helps the reader identify and with them on a humanistic level.

And it is wonderfully enough.David Sedaris recommended this book when we saw him live about a year and a half ago. Like Sedaris, the Patchett did not disappoint.

Can a house both divide and unite a family? These are questions I’m considering after finishing “The Dutch House,” a book I loved in the beginning and end. I got bogged down in the middle but ultimately understood why Patchett centers the house when the character Danny is seemingly the novel’s center. He really isn’t. He’s just the filter through which we see the house. Patchett’s critique of home ownership and the types of dwellings that make a home adds to a long line of books in this sub-genre in which the American (and world) narrative (myth?) about where and how we live is centered.

It is about a brother and his relationship with his older sister. Their age gap is the same as me and my brother and it really got me in the feels about growing up with a little brother. Maeve is not a perfect sister but their bond is unmatched as they toil through the ups and downs of life. I hope that I too can grow old with my brother, watch him grow up and have a family, and have a close relationship through the years. "

The characters were believable and it was an interesting look into their lives, but now that it’s over I’m thinking “that’s it?”. I think this would make a good book club book for further discussion - maybe I’m missing some hidden gems.Lastly, when I saw it was narrated by Tom Hanks I rolled my eyes (I’m not particularly fond of him), but holy moly he is a great story teller. I fell deeply into this story and loved having him tell it to me. I may just like Tom Hanks now…"

Počas začiatku čítania by som to ale netipovala. Vtiahlo ma to postupne, ako rástli a dospievali hlavní hrdinovia. Je to príbeh súrodencov Maeve a Dannyho, v podstate počas celého ich života. Ani neviem presne povedať čo bolo také výnimočné, lebo to bol obyčajný život, mnohokrát s prekážkami a krutosťou, ale aj s láskou, šťastnými okamihmi, nečakanými náhodami a odhaleniami z minulosti. Páčil sa mi aj štýl písania, taký nenútený a zároveň podmanivý."
1250,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5775891-andrea-evergreensandbookishthings,Rating 5 out of 5,"As with any new novel from a beloved author, I go into it with a great amount of excitement and about as much anxiety! What if I'm disappointed? My expectations were even higher than normal for this book, as Patchett's latest is getting so much positive buzz. I can say I found that the buzz was well founded and the more I sit with my thoughts on The Dutch House, the more I feel as if it miiiiight have overtaken State of Wonder as my favorite of her work.Early in the novel, the story churns with righteous anger on behalf of the protagonists: Danny and Maeve. Creating utterly compelling, authentic characters with rich inner lives is one reason I love Patchett's books so much. Right from the beginning, I feel as if I have a unique understanding of these people based on their actions and idiosyncrasies that are just odd enough to seem completely real. ""The madder Maeve got, the more thoughtful she became. In this way she reminded me of our father--every word she spoke was individually wrapped.""Man, I loved that passage! Individually wrapped! Perfection. The choices Danny and Maeve make as their lives spin outward from the tragedies of their childhood seem outrageous and understandable all at once.""There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you'd been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet in place, and for a moment you're suspended, knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself."" The underlying tension of their inevitable march towards the final conflict in the book propelled me forward in the pages at a rapid-fire pace. I don't rehash plot in my reviews, so I won't spoil any bit of it for potential readers. But I will say that even when I knew what was coming, Patchett still delivers the inevitable with utter gut-punches - another trademark I love. Beyond the plot, there is so much lovely and atmospheric writing and symbolism to unpack about the architecture of a dwelling and how it mirrors the architecture of our lives, as well as what the Dutch House, frozen in time, represents to each character. There's also a trove of material to examine about love and loss, how the past shapes our present and future, how our perceptions shape our memory, and ultimately what it means to forgive.Many thanks to the folks at Harper Books for a complimentary advance copy, I will cherish it!For more reviews and bookish musings, visit http://www.bornandreadinchicago.com/"
1251,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5994220-angela,Rating 5 out of 5,"Simply amazing. The best book by Ann Patchett yet. The Dutch House is just as big of a character as Danny and Maeve. We watch them grow up in this house, get booted from the house by their evil stepmother, and rebuild their lives while trying to figure out what happened to their mother. Patchett’s writing and character development are simply amazing. I was able to see both Danny and Maeve’s side of things, even though they were completely different and the story is told from Danny’s perspective only. Ok, now back to nursing my book hangover."
1252,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42652962-janet,Rating 5 out of 5,"Once in a while, I read a book that stays with me long after I've turned the last page. This is one of those books. While I prefer print books, I listened to the audio version of The Dutch House, narrated by Tom Hanks, which made it even more delicious. I laughed, I cried, I was transported to Maeve's car sitting in front of the house and I could smell the cigarette smoke and see Danny and Maeve's arms hanging out the car windows to flick the ashes from their cigarettes. I walked through the house with them, saw the glass, the grandfather clock, the paintings of the Van Hoebeeks. Ann Patchett is a master storyteller, and Tom Hanks's narration was the icing on the cake."
1253,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"I love Ann Patchett's novels and will read everyone she writes. This one left me a bit unsettled and unsatisfied as the characters didn't quite click for me. The mother who deserts her children to follow in the path of Mother Teresa - sorry, Ann. The son who fulfills the family ambition for him to become a doctor and immediately forsakes his profession to manage and develop property - yes, Patchett gives the entire backstory, but all the same. . .. State of Wonder - my favorite. I will revisit it one of these days. "
1254,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/88836558-jeanette-kim,Rating 5 out of 5,Probably a four star book but I enjoyed it at a five star level. Loved the title house as a motif and the use of physical and figurative perspective surrounding it. Also enjoyed the theme of sacrifice and duty and how it presents differently for different genders and generations. The author inserted the right amount of pluck in her characters and narration to make this a very good read. Highly recommend.
1255,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6069769-rachel,Rating 5 out of 5,"I felt like a bad wife every time my husband asked me to take a walk with him because I chose Tom Hanks instead! Without my commute to work, it was the only way I was going to finish this audio-book before my book club (Zoom) meeting. And, oh did I love my drives and walks with Tom! He was the perfect narrator for this engrossing, fascinating, absorbing, and thought provoking modern-day fairy tale of two children expelled from their family's mansion by an evil step-mother. I highly recommend it, especially the audio-book. "
1256,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4811947-addie-dehart,Rating 5 out of 5,"I get why this book wouldn't be everyone's cup of tea. It's definitely low on plot. But I personally loved this family drama. The characters were so rich and I love how the author took us through time weaving the story together. I can't count the number of times I smiled while reading this story. The book was simply charming.The ending was the perfect amount of sad, sweet and hopeful. Also Tom Hanks narrating the audio was perfection."
1257,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16842726-lisa-kost,Rating 4 out of 5,"I enjoyed this book. I find it interesting to read other reviews and have completely different feelings about characters from others who also liked the book. For instance, one reviewer disliked the narrator for multiple reasons and I never had that feeling when reading it. I can see where some of the dislike might generate from but it was not my take on it. I feel like who you are and where you are at in life when you read this has a larger impact on your perceptions of the characters than other books. "
1258,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57614807-april,Rating 5 out of 5,"I thoroughly enjoyed this :') And yes, like many others I, too, listened to the audiobook performed by Tom Hanks! He does an incredible job with Ann Patchett's beautiful writing. The characters and the themes (of family, memory, forgiveness) really grabbed me and I loved the way the different periods in time were all woven together. As soon as I finished I started it again because I didn't want it to be over. And perhaps it struck a chord with me because I've often been guilty of driving to visit houses that I used to live in with my family, staring up at the windows, remembering the past. "
1259,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4020888-maya-sophia,Rating 5 out of 5,"One of the easiest five stars I've ever given. This is the kind of novel that is so far up my alley it's not even funny. It's a family saga that spans decades, beautifully written, with flawed but lovable characters. I wouldn't go so far as to say that the plot was wholly unpredictable, but the nuance that was present in all the relationships made sense for the direction the story went. I also loved how the house was a character in and of itself and I, admittedly, spent pages wondering how the house was while I was following Danny and Maeve's story in other places. The Dutch House ticked all the boxes for me and I'm so excited to dive into more of Ann Patchett's work because it is obvious to me that she writes the kinds of stories that I want to read."
1260,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/145031895-ellen-summerlin-minor,Rating 5 out of 5,"a very captivating book with lovable characters that can frustrate you and also frustrating characters that you can have a soft spot for, which should teach the reader something about loving people over decades. the storytelling is blunt and not drawn out, but also has descriptions so good that it’s like you’ve been to the Dutch House. the plot is well paced and has a satisfying end after several heartbreaking moments. the story does revolve around economic privilege, so there are moments that not every reader could relate to and would do differently than the characters, but it is a wonderful book all the same. a perfect january or rainy day read. "
1261,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11861720-petra,Rating 2 out of 5,2.5 stars. The first disappointment of the year. I really wanted to enjoy The Dutch House because I have heard so many amazing things about Patchett. However I felt so detached both from the characters and plot and in the end was just confused what was the point of the book. It definitely doesn't have a plot but at the same time I don't think that the characters are very well developed either. I can see that Patchett can writes but this left me so lukewarm that I'm hesitant to pick up anything else she has written.
1262,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1122708-megan,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is essentially a domestic drama - the story of a family over many years, primarily the two siblings. It’s honestly just really well told and moving. I listened to the audiobook, brilliantly read by Tom Hanks. It’s such a good reading performance that it may be bringing my rating up for the content of the book itself, but I loved this all around. Just a really interesting, unusual but not unbelievable family with interesting, sympathetic characters. "
1263,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/144867643-grace,Rating 5 out of 5,"Well - I was right. This book really hit me. Teared up & cried multiple times. The exploration of the sibling relationship between younger brother & older sister, Danny & Maeve, over the course of their lives together made me think of how I hope to remain close friends with my brother as we progress through life. The admission of imperfection of all the characters makes this book so much richer & increases the affection the reader has for the characters. The devotion Danny & Maeve have to each other is admirable & endearing. Will definitely be reading more by Patchett in the future. "

1265,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/106348785-ava-ray,No Rating,"My Ann Patchett love affair continues. I feel ill with how much I enjoy Patchett’s writing style, storylines, and characters. From what I’ve gathered, this woman does not set out with plot-heavy intentions; she has characters… and she wants you to love and care for them, know everything about them, and have your heart bleed out for them at the end. If you’re someone who wants ample amounts of dialogue, a set plot, and a true “ending,” this book is not for you. There is no destination, just a really charming ride. The sibling dynamic in this book gutted me. The unavoidable, life-changing situations took me out. The last two chapters repeatedly kicked me in the gut. I am bruised and bloody. Life changes and change is so complex and lonesome, and apparently, Ann knows exactly how to describe it.I read this book until the 90% mark, where I then listened to the last of it - Tom Hanks reads it. I might re-read on audio just to hear him tell this entire story. I have a suspicion it would be a 10/10 experience. I don’t know what I need to do to get you all to read this, but I’ll do it. Gosh damn it, Ann, I feel so wonky when I finish your books; you’re a great writer. I love you so sincerely, please write more. "
1266,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7408617-cheri-mcelroy,Rating 4 out of 5,"This story will haunt me. It’s about selfishness disguised as generosity and unforgiveness brought on my loss and brokenness and the desire for revenge. It’s about people who are imperfect and often unkind but don’t see that plank in their eye because they’re busy looking at the speck in another’s. It’s about complicated family relationships, and is thus totally relatable. It reminds me to let things go before it’s too late."
1267,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1015705-christine,Rating 3 out of 5,"I am so confused by my feelings about this book. So many friends have really loved it and I did not. It may be because I was listening to an audio book at the same time that I thought was better. But I found myself trudging through this novel like it was an assignment, and I didn't enjoy it. The writing was fine, but I felt the storyline meandered too much. And I didn't really care much about the characters, or at least not as much as I feel I should have. Maeve's departure at the end made no sense to me and needed more of an explanation. So this is not up to par for Patchett in my estimation."
1268,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68171410-victor-the-reader,Rating 4 out of 5,"“The Dutch House” is a story full of sorrow and family drama. Told by Cyril Contoy, it centers on his and sister Maeve’s lives as children and adults and the home they once called home before being ousted from it. The beginning caught my interest as it felt a bit like a Cinderella story, but it definitely takes a more heartbreaking turn. It’s not a joyful or happy read, more sad and emotional and tragic near the end. A- (91%/Excellent)"
1269,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18687446-hannah,Rating 4 out of 5,"I kept seeing The Dutch House everywhere and decided to pick it up from the bookstore on a whim. What an enthralling read it was! I couldn’t put it down. It’s an emotionally-charged family drama that explores childhood, siblinghood, motherhood, loss, obsession, and forgiveness. I had never read anything by Ann Patchett before, but surely I’ll be checking out more of her other books now."

While I had known of Ann Patchett, I read a book by her in late 2019 (The Magician’s Assistant) and loved it so much I made my husband read it (not a fiction reader) and he thought it was great also. So late to the party but a HUGE fan!!! If you listen to the book, Tom Hanks narrates it. I will read everything she has written eventually. "

It reminded me of Hearts Invisible Furies and Secret life of Sam Hell. It’s a story about nothing, just the life of Daniel from when is 10 years old, to 50 years old. Nothing exciting, no climax, no murder, no sex. Just a sweet story of his boring life. Tom Hanks was the narrator on this Audiobook, and it was wonderful. "

It lived up to everything I hoped it would be!Beautifully written, relatable characters, and a slow and enjoyable storyline. I really liked how it spanned across several decades and we got to see Danny and Maeve grow up and take on life both in and out of the Dutch House. I loved every second of it, especially since I listened to the audiobook (can I just say that I want Tom Hanks to read everything to me forever?) I’ve enjoyed a few of Patchett’s books and am looking forward to more!!"

I think I could read anything by this author and find it marvellous. I think I mainly preferred the first half with all the drama and switching between timelines. The second half took a bit more of a disappointing turn."
1275,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13129149-meredith-mccaskey,Rating 5 out of 5,"Ann Patchett is magic. This is her best one yet. It is a mark of a truly masterful author that she can take a story that is fairly simple on the outside, and delve so deeply into human nature within it, with writing so perfect that reading it is effortless. It made me think, and I didn’t want it to end. "
1276,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/902322-bronson,Rating 5 out of 5,"In 2003, Ann Patchett made a visit to Driggs Idaho to speak to a group of people about her recent book titled Bel Canto. She’d made the commitment to come to Driggs before Bel Canto took off and it felt a little out of place to have her in a high school auditorium in rural Idaho talking about this very popular book. The organizers of the event arranged for a couple of guests to join her, they had a BYU Professor / Opera singer and a very accomplished pianist. Music has a strong presence in Bel Canto and it was fun to hear some of the pieces referenced in the book performed in person. To hear the author’s perspective and insight on the book made it so personal. It endeared me to Ann Patchett and to Bel Canto. I’ve read some of her other books over the years, I respect and appreciate her as an author. I like her style and I think she’s very good. Recently my sister gifted me the audio edition of The Dutch House. I didn’t know anything about the book and I didn’t have any expectations going it. I trust Patchett but she’s pretty versatile so I wasn’t sure what I’d get. I was excited to learn that Tom Hanks is the reader of the book. I haven’t been this touched by a book in a very long time. It’s so much more than a story, it’s an emotional journey of family, relationships, life, death, forgiveness, healing and it’s all tied beautifully together with the house as a central character and setting. It consumed me, I loved every word and when I wasn’t listening to it, I wanted to be listening. I loved the characters, the story and especially the reader. Tom Hanks becomes the personality of the book; I think his performance propels this from good book to a great one. This book took me to places and feelings I haven’t experienced since reading The Goldfinch. Fiction is powerful and Patchett is a master of her craft. I don’t think I can say enough good about the Dutch House. Highly recommend this one."
1277,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61244166-sam,Rating 5 out of 5,"When you care about the protagonists in a novel so deeply that you cannot possibly close the book until you find out what happens to them (and their house! which is like another character!), as if they were real people you actually knew in real life, you will inevitably stay up long past your usual bedtime and finish the story quite quickly...only to be sad when the story inevitably ends.Rather than merely entering Goodreads updates indicating the percentage read, I could not resist posting a few quotes, since this author's writing is absolutely brilliant. I laughed, I cheered, I hoped, I sympathized...but no spoilers here.May I humbly suggest reading this book as soon as you can obtain it from your local library or independent bookstore. One of my most highly recommended books of 2020 so far, and it's been a stellar year (for books, that is)."
1278,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/286017-lis,Rating 5 out of 5,"I’m giving it five stars partly because it was just a really good story, and I felt engaged and pulled in all the way through. The structure is seamless. I love thinking about structure, and when a novelist can weave one like this I just enjoy myself immensely. Tom Hanks really brings the whole thing to life, so I can’t say how I’d feel about the characters if it wasn’t in his voice in my ear, but I really liked this one. Sad, moving, funny, frustrating people. A dysfunctional family drama for sure and I suppose if that isn’t your thing then steer clear, but it’s definitely mine, so this was perfect."

Nie, nie je to strašidelný príbeh typu Domofón, ale obyčajná stavba s presklenou halou, veľkými oknami, ozdobnými lištami, krásnymi lustrami, schodiskom, tapetami, bývalými holandskými majiteľmi, ktorí dom vlastnili a teraz sa na nových majiteľov pozerajú len z olejových portrétov. Kedysi stál na mega pozemku s dlhou príjazdovou cestou, dnes je už len na menšom, no stále vzbudzuje impozantný dojem. Holandský dom v Pensylvánii.Vlastne je to príbeh dvoch súrodencov a ich matiek. Vlastná mama tento dom nenávidela až príliš a nevlastná ho milovala nadovšetko. A tiež je to príbeh o dedičstve a o tom, čo si v sebe deti nosia až do dospelosti. Vlastne je to aj príbeh o otcovi a chybách, ktoré syn zopakoval. A aj o mame a dcére, ktoré sa obetovali pre druhých. O citovej naviazanosti, o spomienkach a o odpustení. Obálka je prenádherná a úzko prepojená s príbehom. Dej plynul pomaly a zároveň rýchlo. Meniace sa pohľady do minulosti súrodencov Dannyho a Maeve sa prelínali so súčasnosťou.

Engraçado como esta casa, que suscitou tantos ódios e amores, continue, ao longo de todo o livro, como farol, desejo e aspiração (até para nós/mim). É incrível como uma casa pode mudar e influenciar tantos destinos. Foi impossível não julgar algumas das personagens (a mãe, Andrea, …) e não amar outras (Maeve, May, …).

She excels at subtly building the tension of complicated family relationships, and even though many of the characters in The Dutch House aren’t especially likable, they are utterly human, and I found myself rooting for nearly everyone in their own particular way."
1285,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1212527-melissa,Rating 3 out of 5,"This is a story that requires digestion, so I may come back later and change my rating. First impressions: I loved some of the characters (Sandy, Jocelyn, Maeve, May) and moments in the story were achingly poignant. The Dutch house itself was such a massive character I found myself wanting to park outside and sit in my car and admire its formidable frame for myself.I am not entirely on board with a few of the plot choices. While a part of me really likes how it ended, another part thinks it was unwise. I also have conflicting feelings about how it presented many of the novel's themes. (injustice, loyalty, forgiveness, etc.) I am not sure I agree with some of the stances the novel holds on these themes. I do think this book will provide a lot of material for discussion though, and I always appreciate that in a novel."

But Danny is....a child. And he stays a child for a long long time, well into his middle-age. And I don't particularly like Danny, and he's the narrator....and I just.....meh.That all being said, Tom Hanks NARRATING Danny is lovely.

1290,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4787868-angela,Rating 5 out of 5,"Her all-time best book. The story was simple and profound at the same time. Who was worse, Elna or Andrea? Was one of them forgivable and the other not? Good book group choice based on that question alone."
1291,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1021525-jean,Rating 4 out of 5,"I thoroughly enjoyed listening to Tom Hanks’ interpretation of this book.Characters include a wandering mother, a well-meaning but ineffective father, a finagling stepmother, a grand family home, and an unbreakable bond between brother and sister. There is an Ethan Frome twist. "
1292,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19530825-beth-sponzilli,Rating 4 out of 5,This book revolves around a house that is loved and despised all in one. The characters are well thought out and have their own story revolving around this big old house thru the decades. I thought it got better as it went on and I was fully invested in seeing how it all turned out. Good story!
1293,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/82923508-francisco-soberanis,Rating 4 out of 5,"El libro comienza bien, quiero decir, me gustó, pero creo que pierda ritmo casi a la mitad.Pensé en darle 3 estrellas, pero las ultima páginas me llegaron al corazón, es por ello que decidí las 4."
1294,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/106347265-tony-bertino,Rating 5 out of 5,"By far the best Ann Patchett book I've read yet, far ahead of Commonwealth and Bel Canto. Epic and sprawling, yet intimate. It's beautifully written. Every character and storyline is crafted with so much care."
1295,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1620394-mike,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book, about broken children from broken marriages, lost inheritances, and parents with dementia - well, yeah, hit close to home. I loved it, but it made me want to check my old family albums and see if I could spot Patchett in the background, quietly observing me my whole life."
1296,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5382856-laura,Rating 2 out of 5,"I can appreciate obsession, longing, nostalgia, parental issues, and general ennui. The writing was phenomenal. Tom Hanks as narrator for the audio was entertaining. But god, what a drag. A whiney rich white boy is upset his sister is forcing him to become a doctor, he never grows a spine, and he’s unhappy. I could NOT care less about this privileged nonsense. Literary MFA NYC superiority strikes again."
1297,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14978379-laurel-perez,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is a unique fairytale-esque novel of familial drama set in and around the Dutch House, which is a character all on its own. I really liked Maeve, and her relationship with Danny was well wrought. However, somebody the other characters were a little flat for me, but the push writing style saved my final impressions of this novel that spans many many years."
1298,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5664164-kathryn,Rating 5 out of 5,"Full circle. The house given as a present to a wife. Lived in with another, died in, and a future generation circles around. I have to say that listening to Tom Hanks read this story was wondrous. The siblings had to move on with their lives after their father died. So many thoughts."

1302,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15236138-reem-ghabbany,Rating 5 out of 5,Best read of 2021This book was so great I loved every single page of it! There was no part that I thought was boring or unnecessary The brother-sister bond is what I could relate to most and the animosity they harbored for their stepmother is something I relate to as well
1303,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"I’m still kind of wrapping my head around this one, since I listened to the whole thing in one sitting on a road trip. I really loved Danny and Maeve: their realness, their complex relationships, their many endearing qualities in addition to their obvious faults. I sort of wish the book had ended earlier, since after a while it started to feel like they were truly stuck in one place (I mean, yes, I know that was the point…but it still could’ve made that point and allowed them to get closure a little earlier). I’m not sure I would’ve finished if it hadn’t been for the fact that I was driving and had the time to listen. It was just slow and a bit plotless. But lovely writing, fantastic characters, and Tom Hanks’s dulcet tones are enough to give it four stars from me, a not-very-harsh critic. "
1304,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8907554-katie,Rating 5 out of 5,"Oof, that was a good book. Didn’t know anything about it, but saw it recommended on my library app. Not only was the narration fantastic, but the story was SO good. So. Stinkin. Good. I would love to have a visual of the Dutch House — it was so well described I can allllmost picture it. "
1305,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/95609976-alyssa-gonzales,Rating 4 out of 5,4.5 I liked this book the only thing that I couldn’t understand and get was the brother sister relationship. It seemed a little too much for me (her input on his life and vice versa) but maybe it’s cause I’m an only child 🤷🏻‍♀️ 
1306,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17287686-alex,Rating 4 out of 5,"A lovely novel The characters are well rounded. The chapters mostly don’t play out chronologically, but feel more like how someone shared memories over the course of their lives. Not a typical book but an engaging and pleasant read."
1307,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5834201-astar-reads,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.75 stars. Tom Hanks’ narration was amazing! I have thoughts about my feelings on this story, which have a lot to do with personal taste. But I will read more Ann Patchett books in the future and I hope that some of her other stories are more impactful for me."
1308,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"I love stories about families that span generations. In this case the story spans the lives of two siblings, tight in their relationship forged by their mum’s departure from their lives and the interruption to their lives of a stepmother. The two protagonists remain central to the story, we follow their lives through careers, missed or mischosen, to children and the return of their errant mother. This return brings all the complicated disruptions in the smoothish flow of their lives. It begins and ends in the Dutch House, a bit part character but significant to two generations at least. "
1309,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13366014-donna,Rating 4 out of 5," Exquisitely written novel of family interactions, and relationships over a lifetime; I listened to the wonderful audiobook version narrated by Tom Hanks."
1310,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6461259-conner,Rating 4 out of 5,"A lovely, timeless novel. Patchett may have set the bar too high with the opening 100 or so pages (which I adored), but even though the story felt slightly less compelling after its opening act, I still struggled to put it down due to the commitment I felt toward the novel's main characters: Danny, a somewhat oblivious yet entertaining narrator, and Maeve, his selfless, protective, and much more interesting sister."
1311,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4244170-andrea-larson,Rating 5 out of 5,"I don't usually have the patience for meandering stories, but this one was wonderful. Touching explorations of character, a house that is not just a setting but a force, and pitch-perfect writing. Plus I listened to the audiobook, and Tom Hanks' narration is stellar. I could listen to that guy read the phone book. Highly recommended."
1312,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/106415102-vito,Rating 5 out of 5,This one hit hard (especially the last few chapters.)Nothing is guaranteed. 
1313,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2134607-debbie,Rating 5 out of 5,"Although parts of the plot seem incredible, forcing children to sacrifice years of their life for revenge, for instance, in the context of the book it is believable. The love or hate for this unique house brings out the worst in people until, perhaps in the end, love of the house has fallen into perspective and people can simply be happy in it. But maybe not."
1314,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63076-rory,Rating 4 out of 5,"Agnes's and my two-person book club read this for this month's selection and I was so glad we did.

1322,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/78262286-taylor-harper,Rating 4 out of 5,"i think The Dutch House more deftly accomplishes everything The Goldfinch set out to do and more—beautifully explores family relations, objects as memorykeepers, and what it means to tell the story of one’s own unfinished life. Danny is not a particularly compelling character and he is a sort of passive narrator, but his relationship with Maeve is rich enough to almost excuse it. the language is lush without being overwhelming and it never feels flashy, just honest i’m not entirely sold on the ending—the last quarter of the book wraps up quite quickly and nearly too neatly, but it’s also not bad... just doesn’t quite stick the landingdefinitely recommend, especially for folks who are fans of Donna Tart "

1337,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2736585-emily-philbin,Rating 5 out of 5,"Let’s see: a grand (grandiose?) house + motherless children + a distant father + wicked stepmother + two stepdaughters + a death + an exiling = the makings of a typical fairytale... but this novel is far from anything predictable thanks to the author’s compelling storytelling. Patchett’s writing is all-engrossing — she transports you inside the massive windows of the multi-level, ornate Dutch House, seatbelts you in the car alongside Maeve and Danny as the siblings smokily stalk their lost home, and so thoroughly attaches you to these characters it’s as if you are a part of the Conroy family, thus you are invested in every chapter of their lives. That intimacy exists within the pages of a novel that covers decades and decades, yet doesn’t feel so vast, especially with its moments of familial strife, vengeance, ambition and forgiveness, just to name a few. And all of that is simply connected to a home, which is anything but simple, much like its inhabitants, past and present, and the focus of such a wonderful read. "

However, after that great start, and especially in part two and forward, the book started lacking any originality, going in circles, from one timeline to another, leaving few elements and twists to be actual surprises for the reader.

But when a librarian recommends a book, you read it. They're rarely wrong. Dutch house was so compelling I became as consumed with the house as Maeve and Danny were. I want to see it, see the large windows, see the pictures hanging over the fireplace, and see the view out the upstairs back window. The character and plot development were seamless and natural - it didn't feel contrived or too clever (sm that's been bothering me with lit lately). I fell into the story and found myself discovering the Dutch House along with Danny.Takeaway: So far, best book of the year!"

I absolutely loved it!-This was my first Ann Patchett book and it did not disappoint! I loved so many different aspects of this book, but first, a quick summary. The book takes place after the Second World War and focuses on Maeve and Danny, two siblings who live in the Dutch House with their father. Their mother left them, and they are forced to come to terms with a new step mother. Maeve is much older than Danny, so she tries to take care of him and offer him a mother figure, even though she is young herself. The book goes on to depict the rest of their lives, and their strange connection to this House that impacted their lives more than they know!I loved the relationship between Maeve and Danny. Maeve wants what’s best for Danny, and she’s willing to do whatever it takes for him to get it. Through all their ups and downs, they are always there for one another and I thought their connection was truly beautiful. I think Maeve is my favourite character just because she is such a strong character that faces adversity head on! Danny is strong too, but just in a different way!The writing is also amazing! Patchett is able to paint this picture of a family struggling to find their place in this world, and is able to connect the reader to a house that doesn’t seem that important, but ultimately is in the long run! I definitely recommend this book if you enjoy a family tale!"
1369,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9169245-sarah-clancy,Rating 5 out of 5,This one is a must LISTEN. Tom Hanks is a marvel and the prose is perfect for a fairy tale. I wanted to relisten immediately.

I loved the view into this house and outside of it. Values are on full display, and more than the portraits, or the gold-leaf ceiling, or the window seat, it is values that bring this book home. Brava, O Parnassian goddess. "
1371,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2597121-laura-hoffman-brauman,Rating 5 out of 5,"Patchett has outdone herself with this novel about Danny and Maeve, siblings that started their life in a grand house but with a very dysfunctional life. The story weaves through the next 50 years and I lost myself in these wonderfully drawn and perfectly flawed characters. If you like family dramas, this is an excellent read. "

Usually I end up skimming some part of every book I read, but I read every word, and didn't want to go too fast. A lovely story, and written so well. I loved Danny most, then Maeve, then everyone else. The mom was fascinatingly hard to wrap my head around."
1374,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/529705-beverly,Rating 4 out of 5,"A strong, well written family saga is one of my favorite things. Finally Ann Patchett doesn’t disappoint. This is the story of self made real estate magnate Cyril Conroy and the family he moves into the most beautiful house in the world. As the family grows and moves on the house remains the emblem of their lives, its continued existence keeping and bringing them together. Not too sentimental and reaching beyond Patchett’s usual limited realm of women’s fiction."

This had none of that. What it did have was a repetitive family drama drawn out over decades. That said, I read to the end to see what happened!"

Patchett does a wonderful job of a painting a picture that reveals how complicated relationships are, especially in a family, and how people aren't always clearly good or bad; most characters have a little of both in them. While not necessarily an unhappy ending, it felt unsatisfying because I wanted better for Danny and Maeve. "

1413,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20456905-joanne-kelleher,Rating 3 out of 5,"My favorite part of this book was Tom Hanks on the audio version! Hanks was perfect as the steadfast Danny, doggedly pursuing an unwanted medical degree, then methodically building a real estate empire.There was not much action; it was more of a study of the relationship between Danny and his older sister Maeve and their childhood home, the Dutch House. For all the time Danny and Maeve sat in a car watching the Dutch House and talking about their lives, it took them a really long time to realize some truths about themselves (as is does for all of us!) If you like this type of slow boil of a character study, you will enjoy taking this journey with the Conroy siblings. "
1414,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,Thank you Stacey Wolfe for recommending I put this in my library cue back in November- when you told me Tom hanks was the reader. Took 3 months to get and so worth it. Lovely multi generational story with wonderful characters but my fave character was the house. A great listen. And that step mother character Andrea... here is hoping you don’t have an Andrea in your family.

1420,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19808215-brett-howe,Rating 4 out of 5,Danny is the main character and narrator. I started off feeling sorry for him and his plight but then realized rather quickly that he was basically self-centered and uncaring probably by design. The plot has a few good twists and turns. The evil stepmother thing is in full swing as well. This is great storytelling. It is worth a read and 4 stars but I personally had trouble staying engaged with a main character who did not deserve my empathy. I do have a pretty high bar for empathy though. I could have also done without the last chapter that tied up everything in a nice neat now. I feel the book could have ended more abruptly one chapter sooner. But then LOL I would have probably complained about that. 
1421,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/91550046-kellyann-sutton,Rating 5 out of 5,FIVE STARS! I let Tom Hanks lead the way as I listened intently. A beautiful story of a sibling relationship that surpasses years + finances. LOVED IT! 
1422,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70364053-anya-ryazanova,Rating 4 out of 5,"A perfect portrait of American entitlement and privilege. A bunch of WASPs lose their sh… over a piece of real estate, their supposed heirloom, which was never theirs to begin with and came to them by chance, luck or their father’s half legal dealings. But they will spend most of their mature lives carrying this anguish and bile towards anyone who dares lay claim to their precious possession, although they themselves have always hated it (count all the times they complain about stairs)As good as this book is written in terms of style, the central characters are simply annoying. And the most annoying part is that there is no real conflict, no trauma and all of them end up owning the house or living in it. His “sacred by right of birth” lot came back to Danny and his kids as if by magic - miraculously none of his stepmother’s kids or family wanted it - the right order of succession is restored, continuity of wealth is unquestionable. Even their vagabond mom, who had wanted nothing to do with the house is now ok living there?I enjoyed reading this book, but I don’t really know what to make of it…"

Boring and at times confusing because it jumped back and forth between too many time periods, not to mention the fact you never really knew what year it was. Some parts of this were great, while others were lacking and had me rolling my eyes. The theme I guess would be forgiveness and letting go...and I struggled with the people that were forgiven in this story as for me there are some things that just can't be forgiven."

I am delighted I listened to the audio version, as Tom Hanks does a wonderful job narrating. I found myself wrapped in a world of nostalgia, as my life (oddly) has so many parallels to this touching story. The most striking similarity was the close relationship between Maeve and Danny. A sibling relationship based on unconditional love - the same as my brother and I had; as siblings do when they go through hard times together, take care of each other, and have a truly blessed relationship. So beautifully written and such a great read for me - thank-you Ann Patchett."

It is a story of learning to let go, especially of the stories we tell ourselves. My only quibble is that it is about sometimes poor but mostly rich or upper middle class white people, including two characters who become rich being slum landlords. I would have liked some reflection by at least one of those characters on that, but it passes by unremarked."

I can't imagine liking this so well if it hadn't been Tom Hanks reading it, definitely recommend the audiobook over reading it.After the first half I second guessed whether I wanted to keep going—family drama is not my favorite genre—but the quality of the writing was so good and I wanted to see if there would be resolution or redemption. It's like most lives—a mix of tragedy, irony, revelation, and, in the best of circumstances, forgiveness and acceptance—and worth seeing through to the end."

1464,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52444769-fantine,Rating 4 out of 5,"My main critique was going to be that I wasn't that emotionally invested in the characters- until the last 200ish pages when it suddenly began to feel as though someone had reached into my chest, firmly grasped my heart, and was squeezing harder with each page.Quiet and thoughtful this novel failed to fall into melodramatic family tropes and instead plodded along in a confidently even pace, skipping through time with great restraint revealing only what was necessary when necessary. At its core this is a story of family bonds, made strong not by blood but by actively loving and the continuous choosing of one another. Danny and Maeve's relationship was by far the strongest aspect of this novel, it was refreshing to read such a well crafted and genuine sibling relationships, especially between a man and a woman.“There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you'd been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet in place, and for a moment you're suspended, knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself.”Unfortunately, the combination of slow pacing and gradual reveals teetered on the edge of tedium. The earlier chapters felt emotionally closed off in a way that made sense for the character of Danny, but did not serve the story. The Conroy siblings grow from children to adults through disjointed snippets, and it was these chapters of supposed growth and change that I found underwhelming. The youthful years lacked the messy exuberance that I love so much in coming of age novels- the formality of the writing felt at odds with the perspective of a child and quickly became monotonous. I found myself clinging to small moments of spontaneity; a swear, a sneaky cigarette or mention of a drunk college party. These moments were few and far between, and although they did not completely bridge the distance I felt from these characters they were a welcome reprieve.My patience was rewarded with a succinct and poetic pay off that was neither expected nor unexpected but felt right and wrapped up a very thoughtful story about the layered nature of time and place, and the flawed individuals can only navigate by doing what they feel is best. ""But we overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we're not seeing it as the people we were, we're seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.”"

The house itself becomes a character, with its individual relationships intertwined through time and space. Small visual and thematic parallels punctuate the book with little gems, satisfying. This story spirals out and gravitates back in the way you expect an Ann Patchett novel to. It’s quite good, but not her best."

What I can say, though, is that I highly recommend listening to it. The characters, Danny (Tom Hanks) and Maeve, are superbly written and how their relationship evolves will stay with me for a very long time. I am not going to give anything away as I think it better to just experience it page by page. What a gem!!  Maeve had no use for parties. She would have come outside. I stood there quietly, as if it were possible to scare her away. I gave myself this small indulgence sometimes, the belief that, if only I paid attention, I would see her sitting in the darkness outside the Dutch House.

1485,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1119121-julie,Rating 5 out of 5,"Satisfying, fully realized portrait of a Philadelphia family and their house. This book is every possible thing that could mean, and more. Newly rich real estate speculator Cyril Conroy buys a beautiful jewel of a house as a surprise for his wife, Elna, around the end of WWII. She hates the house, and a few years after her second child is born, leaves the family for parts unknown. Left to carry on, the child Danny is cared for by the help, Sandy and Jocelyn, his older sister Maeve, his remote father, and a nanny called Fiona, or ‘Fluffy,’ at least until the latter is dismissed in disgrace. Jumping around in time, the novel’s main objective is for Danny to provide as full a portrait of his sister Maeve as possible, chronicling her intelligent, no-nonsense personality and the life choices she makes to preserve the siblings’ interests despite the thoughtlessness of the adults in their lives.Andrea, the evil stepmother character of this dark rags-to-riches-to-rags fairytale, gets her claws in Cyril just because she wants the house. Andrea turns out to have two daughters of her own. Danny and Maeve fend for themselves much of the time, and even after they have gotten away, they share their unfinished grief over their mother’s abandonment by returning again and again to park on the street in front of the Dutch House, talk, and sometimes sneak a cigarette.The novel moves to a satisfying conclusion that ends as well for the house as for the family. This is a character-driven story, but one of its protagonists is the house. We learn that everyone hates the elaborate ceiling in the dining room, which keeps people from using it. There is a little door in an upstairs closet that hides treasures. It has a third-floor ballroom which was full of raccoons and fleas when they bought the house, but Conroy did not know that because he had a bad knee from the war and did not climb all the stairs. Presiding over all are dour portraits of the Dutch House’s original owners, the VanHoebeeks, along with a portrait of Maeve as a girl (presumably the cover art).“We overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.” The non-linear narrative works well because Danny can unfold events at different stages in his life more or less clearly depending on whether he is an adult, an adolescent, or a child. As a three-year-old, his memory of Fluffy smacking him with a spoon is traumatic, but when he encounters her later on as an adult, he finds the grudge he ought to hold just isn’t there. As one does, he lets his memories come and go from different years, but as a result the portrait is built masterfully. I deeply appreciate the opportunity to read the ARC through NetGalley. This was really a treat."

I was still at the point in my life when the house was the hero of every story, our lost and beloved country.
It was apt that I read Ann Patchett's latest novel, 
The Dutch House
, while I was at McCrae. McCrae is the place where I've spent all of my summers. This year, I saw for the first time, the house that has been built where my family's fibro beach shack once stood. When the shack was sold (I was devastated) people said to me, ""It's just a house, you still have the memories."" Logically, I knew this to be true but it didn't explain why I continued to pass the house, seeing the unfamiliar cars in the driveway, and the new curtains hanging in the window, and always wondering, ""Did 'they' love the house as much as I did?""In The Dutch House, I found kindred spirits in siblings Maeve and Danny. The house in question is named for the nationality of its original owners, the Van Hoebeeks (although features Delft mantlepieces, a dining room with a deep blue and gilt ceiling, and a powder-room with carved walnut panels of birds and flowers). Danny describes the house as “...more in keeping with Versailles than Eastern Pennsylvania..."" and as a child, found its opulence 'mortifying'.Danny and Maeve are forced to leave the Dutch House but, as adults, they frequently return, parking across the street, observing the house from a distance and reflecting on what had happened to them (I won't give that part of the story away!) -
""...like swallows, like salmon, we were the helpless captives of our migratory patterns. We pretended that what we had lost was the house, not our mother, not our father. We pretended that what we had lost had been taken from us by the person who still lived inside.... 
It is during one of these visits that Danny asks Maeve whether she thought it was possible to '...ever see the past as it actually was.' While Maeve insists that she does that, Danny is not so sure and proposes that we in fact '...overlay the present onto the past,'
""We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we're not seeing it as the people we were, we're seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.""
So where does this leave me, and my memories of a far-from-opulent beach shack? I think I'm with Danny, and that my 'past' with the beach shack represents a carefree childhood; an endless summer; family; a life free of responsibility, timetables, and expectations - all seen though the far more burdened lens of the present.I've said little about the plot of The Dutch House - I won't go into specifics but know that the gentle twists and turns are absolute perfection.Equally wonderful is the deliciously complex theme of motherhood, which Patchett magnifies by adding fairy tale elements to the story - the 'wicked' stepmother; the distant father; the fairy godmother; a red coat; life-saving elixirs; and the magical castle (and in the case of the Dutch House, its secret doors; curtains enclosing window-seats; a dark basement; and chests and wardrobes full of things that hadn't been touched in decades). These narrative elements are familiar and yet Patchett incorporates them out in a way that is unexpected but nonetheless believable.
Mothers were the measure of safety, which meant that I was safer than Maeve. After our mother left, Maeve took up the job on my behalf but no one did the same for her.
5/5 I didn't think I could love a story as much as I loved 
Commonwealth
, but there you go, Patchett has done it again.I received my copy of The Dutch House from the publisher, Bloomsbury Publishing ANZ, via NetGalley, in exchange for an honest review."

I have to say that this book did not do it for me. I found the whole story sad and found the characters, one after the other, as odd and not very likeable. I felt sorry for the two main characters and found their decisions odd. For the main character, he went through Med school simply because his sister wanted to deplete the trust fund as aggressively as possible. Really? Would you go through all of that for revenge? Or to please your sister, who seems to have complete control or influence over your decisions? And if you didn’t really want to be a doctor would you not pursue something for yourself?"

The reason, of course, is that reading is such a subjective pursuit; I often look for things in a ""good"" book that others do not consider at all. That being said, The Dutch House didn't quite resonate with me. It wasn't a ""bad"" book - seriously, it's by Ann Pachett! I simply didn't connect well with it. There are some specific reasons for my misgivings, mostly related to plot and somewhat to characterization. I did enjoy the time-hopping structure, and a there were a few of lovely moments. Overall, though, the story fell flat. I still recommend reading it, however; from all the wonderful reviews, many others felt much differently about it."

"
1506,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/81810516-mina-vucicevic,Rating 3 out of 5," Original rating:  2.5 starsYou can find the full review on  Stacked The Dutch House basically takes the fairytale structure and turns it upside down. Instead of our heroes journeying through poverty and suffering in order to get their happily ever after, they start off as a sort of prince and princess, only to have their stepmother take it all away from them. I have to say, I loved the premise and the first third of the novel. Danny’s and Maeve’s childhood, their mostly absent father, relationships with the stepmother and stepsisters, they all play a big role in their connection to the House. At some points, it feels like a fairytale, like it’s too good to be true. Once Andrea enters the picture, there’s this feeling of impending doom that gets worse and worse as time goes by. Honestly, I think the first part is a fantastic set-up for a great story about grief and loss. So what went wrong?I feel like the main problem with The Dutch House is the choice of the narrator. Danny is a good-enough main character in Part 1, and I felt that his childish naivete added to the suspense and the overall narrative of the novel’s beginning. Once they leave the House, following the course of events from his POV stops making sense. For him, it’s rather simple — as Celeste put it, you were rich and now you’re not, get over it. He’s not as damaged as Maeve, nor as traumatized, bitter or obsessed. He didn’t stop living after they were banished; she did. I feel that by sidelining Maeve’s (way more compelling than Danny’s) character, Patchett not only made her a flat character and left many questions unanswered but also detached us from the consequences of the events that took place in the beginning. With Maeve as a POV character, the novel could have explored trauma, grief, and the way all these events affected them with more heart. There’s an overall lack of plot, and Danny’s cold narration of what they did after they left the House just doesn’t cut the mustard.Another issue I have with this novel is the general lack of character development and motivation (and again, I think this wouldn’t be as noticeable had Maeve been our narrator). So many of our protagonists’ decisions make zero sense. Yes, Danny was a kid when he enrolled in medical school, but why would he, a decade later, as an adult man, still remain in the field he dislikes? How many adults would sacrifice their whole professional lives only to feed their sister’s obsession? And while we’re at it, why on Earth did Maeve insist on draining the education fund when she obviously cared for Norma and Bright? And yes, the House represents the childhood they lost, but we still can’t see why everyone is so obsessed with it during their whole lives. It’s not only the main characters I have issues with. Celeste is a one-dimensional cardboard box with no real storyline, development, or general purpose in the novel aside from being there to give Danny a wife and kids. The only part of the story related to her character I liked is the reason Danny decided to marry her — it’s ugly, but that’s what many people do, so that’s probably the most realistic bit about her.Andrea is the flattest of all the flat characters I’ve encountered recently, so I really don’t have much to say about her. I also hated the direction Patchett took with her character in the end. The introduction of another “motherly” character (I’m trying to avoid major spoilers, so I won’t name her) is also a complete failure and serves no real purpose in the story. I think that The Dutch House had a lot of potential. Yet, if I had to describe it in one phrase, it would definitely be — a missed opportunity. What started as an amazing tale about siblings who cannot learn how to deal with loss and nostalgia turned into a mediocre story that never really goes anywhere. Still, I can’t say it’s a boring or a bad book. The beginning is truly amazing, and Patchett’s writing is compelling enough to keep you invested. So, I would recommend this book as a light read, but my advice is not to expect too much from it."

In many other hands, I wouldn't have appreciated a story of a messed up family, imprinted on a beautiful, impractical house. But of course Patchett made it work. This is a bildungsroman and an exploration of family ties, and the differences that can exist between blood and marriage. It's also about greed, forgiveness, and what it means to sacrifice.

It means so many different things to different characters. And watching Danny and Maeve grow up and start attaching a feeling.The character studies conducted by the Dutch House were fascinating — from the siblings' attachment to their childhood home to Edna's strong disdain of it.The sibling relationship was so precious. And their relationship with their mom was interesting as well.The plot was quiet and easy to follow. Yet, it has enough conflicts to keep me engaged. The writing was perfect for this novel. It's pretty but not too complicated. And I can admire it without struggling to comprehend its content.Overall, it's brilliantly executed, well-crafted, and definitely complicated (in a good way)."

Absolutely amazing.I will not give a full plot summary, because I think going in without expectations, or judgment, allows the reader to fully immerse themselves in the book. I found the audiobook version of this book, read by Tom Hanks, and could tell from the get go this was gonna be a good one. Thus, I decided early on to buy a physical copy from the bookstore, and immerse myself in the full experience of the book. I’m my experience touching the paper, hearing and seeing the people in my mind, makes the connection with the book and characters that much stronger.I had that experience with this book.The main characters, siblings Danny and Maeve will stay with me for a long time. We follow their intertwined lives, complicated childhood, adulthood, with the setting of the Dutch House always on the background. I felt like I was with them, breathing alongside them, feeling what they felt. The book is written from Danny’s point of view, which I think adds another layer of complexity- the story is seen from his eyes: The past, the present, the future. The emotions felt are his. How does that influence how we feel as a reader? How does that influence how we see the other characters? How does it influence how the past is portrayed? Complex questions to contemplate upon completion of the book. From tears, to laughter, to frustration, this book made me feel a lot. At times I wondered where the story was headed and what would happen next. But now that I finished it, everything feels like it fit together like a puzzle. Every moment was necessary for the next. To create a whole.Like Danny’s experience with chemistry class, you can’t understand chapter 2, if you don’t have the knowledge of chapter 1.Author Ann Patchett delivers a remarkable book that I think is a must read. There is so much room for discussion regarding the character development, the ins and outs of the house, the family, the people, the story. Yet, for me, there is no discussion regarding the love I feel for the imperfect, and beautiful characters.  I hope you will consider reading this book! "

I love Ann Patchett, and I say this with the authority of someone who has read a decent number of her books (some marked as unread here only because my reading predates Goodreads) and has even visited her bookstore, where the people who ring up your purchase compliment you on your choices and tell you interesting facts about them that you won't find in the normal book blurb. So yes, I'm a super fan—skeptics take this with a grain of salt, but really, you should read it anyway. This is not a perfect book, but honestly, it is about as close as I've come in a while. The characters are all flawed, and ugly and remarkable, just the way I like them. I've seen reviews that cast the narrator in a bad light, but he bared his soul in the telling, and willing to admit he did not always do the right thing. And also, the narrator of the audio book is Tom Hanks, so you literally forgive him everything. Definitely recommend the audio-book on this one, especially if you are quarantined and eager to hear a new voice in your house."

Maeve would be fine…Even the oldest angers could be displaced.”With her novel The Dutch House, Ann Patchett bends our ideas of characters. She weaves a story around two children, Maeve and Danny, who grow close as most of the people in their lives fail to understand and properly love the children. We follow the sister and her younger brother through the trials of their lives, but both are also caught in the ever-progressing history of their childhood home, the Dutch House. When their wealthy father remarries, the story feels reminiscent of a Cinderella story, with their step-mother Angela always putting herself and her two young daughters before her step-children. When the children believe themselves to be parentless, their lives are thrown into partial chaos, with their step-mother in control of all of their father’s assets, except for a trust for Danny’s education. Maeve vows to send Danny to the most expensive schools, hoping Angela will not be able to touch the one thing their father left for his children. Patchett makes the Dutch House its own character. Danny and Maeve feel drawn to the house and when they are near it, they reminisce on their past and futures, jumping around the plot of their lives. The reader gets to experience the character’s lives as their memories, not often progressing in a linear order. The house becomes the center of many of the novel’s conflicts and trials. The reader is made to feel they know the house and its residents, both current and past. The home is located in the suburbs of Pennsylvania, so I felt a geographical connection to the novel as well. It’s always a surreal feeling when a book mentions cities and roads familiar to me as a reader. Maeve quickly became my favorite character. She is often the voice of reason in the novel, being the older and more experienced sibling. She is forced to take care of her brother when her parents go off living their own lives with little emotional care for the siblings. As a child, Maeve is diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, and Danny must constantly worry over her health and if his sister is properly taking care of herself. I easily related to Danny, with my own sister having this condition and our closeness as siblings facing the trials of life. This novel had me in tears numerous times, as Danny is often forced to act as the older sibling, making sure his sister stays alive and healthy. As a woman, Maeve is often looked over by her father, who did not leave her any money to continue her education like he did for Danny. She is extremely intelligent and hard-working and endlessly ignores her own needs and desires. In the Dutch House, there is a portrait of Maeve which continues to be a part of the siblings’ lives even as they no longer feel welcome as a part of the household. The portrait holds stories of Maeve’s past, but also weaves itself into the future of her family. I highly recommend the audiobook version of this novel. Tom Hanks narrates as the voice of Danny, and I could not stop listening to his mesmerizing way of storytelling. The novel jumps around on the timeline of Danny and Maeve’s lives often, but it was never jarring in the audiobook. The cover art is also gorgeous, looking like the painting of Maeve, and I often found myself starring at the artwork as I listen to Tom Hank’s reading. This novel shows the possibilities of character studies and pushes the limits of this kind of story with the characterization of the Dutch House. Anyone who enjoys character description, art, and architecture will enjoy this novel. Happy reading!"

1520,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11751450-stephanie,Rating 5 out of 5,"In The Dutch House, novelist Ann Patchett skates the same fine line between creative nonfiction and fiction as she did in Bel Canto. In that earlier novel she took an event in Peruvian history, the occupation of the Japanese embassy by Shining Path, the Maoist communist party, and made a magically human story.In The Dutch House, she turns a dwelling into a totem. Is there a doubt in any reader’s mind that this piece of early 20th century architecture is a fiction? Surely, this edifice built by a fortune amassed from cigarettes sale during the first World War exists somewhere in the world. It is realer than real.The VanHoebeeks House resides in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania. Its three stories, its paintings, dishware, hidey holes and third floor ballroom are what tear apart a family and temporarily reconstitute themselves around another with the intrusion of a second wife, Andrea, and her two young daughters, Norma and Bright.On a large scale it is how people react to poverty and wealth.Danny, 8, and sister, Maeve, 15, meet their soon-to-be stepmother in the drawing room of the Dutch House where she gazes at portraits of the founders. What unites Andrea with their father Cyril is appreciation of the estate, the house he bought for their mother.Danny narrates the story from the perspective of a middle-aged adult looking back on the wrenching events of his childhood: the abandonment of his mother, Elna, the descent into grief and diabetes of his older sister, who takes on his mothering, and the stability provided by two housekeeper/cooks, Jocelyn and Sandy.When Cyril Conroy dies of a heart attack four years after taking a second wife, Danny and Maeve are driven from the Dutch House. Their stepmother takes all, only leaving monies for Danny’s education.The book traces three generations of this Irish Catholic family, whose stories swirl around the purchase and loss of property.Much about the stepmother Andrea remains in the dark. She seems to have just stuck around like a “virus,” Danny remembers. As young adults and even later, when he and Maeve would park across the street from the house, smoking, they wondered how their father even met her.“I always thought he (Andrea’s first husband) put her out on the curb with the kids, and Dad must have driven by at just the wrong moment and offered them a ride,” Maeve said.One of Patchett’s great gifts as a storyteller is the way she interrupts a tense or tragic moment with humor. Like here. When Andrea delivers her two little daughters to the care of Maeve on a Saturday night, she waves all questions aside: ” ‘Do you have books? Norma, ask Maeve to get you a book.’ ”“Maeve had a stack of Henry James novels on her bedside table,” Danny narrates. “The Turn of the Screw? Is that what they wanted?”As a narrator, Danny leaves many details to be filled. “I was asleep in the world,” he admits, having to be told that Sandy and Jocelyn, his long-time caregivers, were sisters.Maeve demonstrates herself as the hard-headed realist; Danny is unobservant with a kind heart.It’s Maeve that insists that Danny undertake a career as a doctor, hoping to impoverish Andrea and the girls. When he says he feels sorry for Norma and Bright “over there by themselves,” Maeve says: “May they rot in hell. All three of them.”Through the course of the book, we go through three generations, starting with Cyril’s and Elna’s, ending with Danny’s children. If possible, The Dutch House may be too sprawling, too filled with truths and little stories.Strangely, even though The Dutch House didn’t stay with me, I can pick up any page and want to get right back into it. It was a near impossible book to put down."

This book is all about wealth, greed, forgiveness and family - inspired by the 2016 election where ""the country seemed to be caught up in this massive celebration of extreme wealth.""

There had been four children in the house and only two of them had gotten out.”Danny Conroy is telling the story of a family. It’s about his parents, his father and his absent mother. It’s about his stepmother and her two daughters. Eventually, he adds his wife and his own children to the continuing saga. But, mostly this story is about his sister, Maeve. It’s also the story of the Dutch House, a lavish, incongruous mansion which is the centerpiece for decades of family drama. There were times when I didn’t like any of the characters in this book. They all seemed so determined to create more loss and heartache. But, I couldn’t sustain my dislike or my frustration with their behavior. Patchett has a way of writing characters who are humanly flawed individuals. I cared about them. I kept hoping life would turn out well for them. I liked that the book didn’t end with a cliched happily ever after, but with a sense of a full life coming full circle. I don’t think I need to say anything about the audio performance.

The vivid portrayal of the Gatsby-esque Dutch House itself is evocative and remains central throughout the lives of the siblings as a symbolic remnant of their childhood. Yet, I found the characters themselves to be intolerably two-dimensional and left me feeling cheated. If only we could have had greater access to intricate thoughts and feelings, particularly the female voices of Maeve, Andrea and Elna, as opposed to being largely reliant on dialogue and Danny’s rather limited interpretations. The ending only added fuel to the fire.All that being said, the book’s themes prompted many interesting questions and personal reflections. At what point does nostalgia and sentimentalism become ‘wallowing’ in one’s own resentment and trauma? What is the fate of the female ‘saint’? At what point does a protective sibling relationship become co-dependency? And why was Cyril so bland...?!"

1541,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/418309-jane,Rating 5 out of 5,"I was not at all impressed as I read the first third. The characters seemed cold, the house (the setting seemed cold). I ached for the children. And. I was determined to continue because so many people I know loved it and it's the next book for one of the book clubs I belong to. I ended up enthralled. I love Ann Patchett's wizardry. It's unlike anything of hers I've read. And the issues of cruelty and forgiveness are so woven into my own life that I was humbled by how Patchett handled them. I live right up the road from Elkins Park, in Wyncote, which is also next to Jenkintown, where I taught for 37 years. The geographical setting fascinated me. It's my home. But I haven't seen any houses quite like this one, although many of the houses in this area are fancy, far more than our home. I'm curious about how she settled on this place and what home she imagined there. The people are so clueless as they marry and choose careers. That's actually not the thing that struck me most...it was how so few people told the ones they married or the people in their families what they wanted...in a house, in a relationship. Andrea is the clear villain. And yet some might say that Danny and Maeve's mother is the villain for leaving them to go to India. If you are confused yet still fascinated, read this book. I wasn't sure, but I ended up realizing how much it enchanted me, and taught me...about my own flaws, about families and families' flaws and how much kindness can survive in spite of the way we hurt each other.Later I found out that the impetus was that Patchett wanted to explore the ""evil stepmother"" through the eyes of her step-children. So we experience Andrea through Maeve and Danny's experience of her. Also, there were her thoughts about wealth, about how, often, it can cause a life to turn in on itself in a really horrible way, controlling the person's psyche and therefore their life. What if someone decided to walk away from wealth, to ground one's life in simplicity and kindness...Of course, that leaves your children stranded. The setting was chosen, because Elkins Park, a long walk from my neighborhood of Wyncote...the same old mansions from the early twentieth century...was a place she visited often. Her college room mate's family lived there...not in quite so fancy a house, but similar. The landmarks are all familiar to me...I live three blocks from the Jenkintown train station, and Jenkintown is where I taught. So I can picture where Maeve lived. The house is definitely an important character in the book. My childhood home in Mt. Airy, a Philadelphia neighborhood, is certainly a character in my life. For a while all eight of us kids lived in this house with our parents...until my brother went off to college. So many memories. Our house was always filled with our friends, my parents' friends. The house is haunted by the mother's absence and then contagious with the step mother's power. It's very different from most books I read. I think the setting drew me in so thoroughly...also, it was a book group choice"

The audio version took me through at a slower pace than I usually read to myself, so I savored words more, noticed details more, enjoyed the people more. On top of that, the reader is Tom Hanks, so there's another extra star right there.All that follows this, which I wrote after my first read:I’m wandering around real life in a fog this afternoon because I can’t shake the world the Dutch House fills or my feeling of loss that my time in it is over.This is a deep, sweet, piercing book. I loved it.I was disoriented on the first page. It took a second reading of the opening paragraphs for me to realize I was seeing the world through the eyes of a little boy. Danny is sitting on a window seat, draperies pulled around him, for privacy, he says, “though at eight I had no notion of privacy. I liked the word and I liked the boxed-in feel the draperies gave when they were closed.”And I liked him right off the bat. Someone named Sandy was hurrying to get him and his sister presentable to appear on the house’s main floor. Maeve’s “hair was long and black and as thick as ten horse tails tied together. No amount of brushing ever made it look brushed.”A few pages later, they’re sitting in a car, smoking (or maybe this was one of the times they were stopping smoking?), remembering. Danny shivered but “Maeve was an Icelandic truck driver at heart, no weather stopped her.”Patchett moves back and forth through time the whole book. Without any garish clues or bold headings, she deftly keeps you with her.Danny and Maeve grew up in the Dutch House. Now they look at it from the street and try to put their memories in order. Danny thinks it’s an impossible task.“We overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.”Maeve laughs and asks if he’s taking a psychiatry class.Patchett’s writing is as good as ever. She lets you in on the secrets as Danny learns them, so some hit hard and some feel like you knew them subconsciously all along. She picks the exact details to bring people and moments to life.Danny, on the train: “A kid with a backpack full of bricks kept turning to say something to his girlfriend, and every time he did, he clocked me with the full weight of his possessions.”His one-time nanny: “This was a woman whose biology betrayed her at every turn. Emotions stormed across her face with a flag.”But all of that is just the well-lit wall that creates the perfect space for the real art: The story. It will make you think about family, and who you are with and without them. It will make you deeply love the people who are their family, in practice and in fact. It may make you cry. It did me."

Soon their father, Cyril Conroy, remarries and Andrea Smith enters their life. For Andrea, The Dutch House was the ultimate prize but not the children that came with it. When, at 53, Cyril Conroy passes away from a heart attack, Andrea finally gets the opportunity to kick out Meave and Danny from her castle. 🏠It's wondrous how certain inanimate objects can exert so much pull over us humans. Wise ones call this our material attachments, but I think there's something else too. Possibly, it was the same thing that caused Andrea to become so ruthless towards Meave and Danny. And it was the same thing that kept drawing Meave and Danny back to The Dutch House, despite their shocking exit from the house.🏠I have rarely come across 'things' in stories that claim as much significance as the characters. Perhaps it is here where Patchett shines as a storyteller. The Dutch House is not a mere structure. It is the nucleus that holds together the saga of the Conroys across decades. The house claims as much personality as other main characters. Yet its magnanimity is neither a colour that outdoes others in the story's canvas nor a missable shade in the background - it stands there silent and solemn claiming its integrity over the expanse of 50 years through the way it anchors Danny and Meave to itself.🏠The Dutch House is everlasting. It doesn't ever seem to lose its grandeur and so is it's namesake story. The Dutch House is a story of relationships, of siblings, of family, of their long-drawn inside jokes, of deep brewing resentments, of betrayals, losses, and forgiveness.🏠Before The Dutch House made its appearance on my feed, I was not aware of Ann Patchett. Few superb reviews, that glorious cover with the portrait, and the fact that Tom Hanks performed it's audiobook made me pick it up. And once I started, I was just sucked into it; completely invested in the siblings' lives as if they were my own, and being so worried about them that I could not pick my other reads.🏠Ann Patchett blew me away. She took seemingly simple characters, put them through all kinds of life's crests and troughs and brought out a beautiful and lasting tale of familial bonds. Although the story has multiple instances of lows, in no way has Patchett romanticised tragedies. She has treated all the situations - miniscule or life-altering - in the most normal way. And though it's a tale which covers decades of people's lives, there was no point when I felt like skipping pages and moving on.🏠Of all the characters, I felt most connected to Meave. As a result, I was left a little unquenched when Patchett did not help me with a more detailed picture of her life. All I had were Meave's interactions with Danny and later his family. Ignoring this bit, I found The Dutch House a beautiful and supremely satisfying read. And I am quite sure I will carry around its hangover I for days to come."

Her stories always involve family in some way, often spanning generations and memories, and her extraordinary previous book, Commonwealth, was a poignant, multiple perspective masterpiece which took my breath away. •Her latest, The Dutch House of the gorgeous cover, is mostly a tenderhearted sibling tale, told through the somewhat unreliable eyes of the younger brother. This time, the “family” that comes in and out of the lives of Danny and Maeve, the devoted siblings (whose relationship with each other is more significant to each other than any other) includes absent and distant parents and an evil step-mother, as well as a kindly housekeeper and cook who become surrogate parents to the motherless children. An unabashed fangirl of Anne Patchett, I read this one a few months ago. Sometimes I delay reviewing my favorite books, even if I will only be singing their praises. It’s as if the review will really, truly end the reading experience, and I don’t want that to happen! Anyone else do anything like that or am I the only weirdo?😂•I find Patchett’s books irresistible.

Her stories always involve extraordinary “family” in some way, often spanning generations, and her previous book, Commonwealth, was a poignant, multiple perspective masterpiece which took my breath away.•Her latest, The Dutch House—of the gorgeous cover—is mostly a tenderhearted sibling tale, told through the somewhat unreliable eyes of the younger brother. This time, the family that comes in and out of the lives of Danny and Maeve (the devoted siblings whose relationship with each other is more significant than any in their lives) includes absent and distant parents, an evil step-mother, and a kindly housekeeper and cook who become surrogate parents to the motherless children. As in her other books, the narrative jumps around in time and the past, along with the nostalgic memories that accompany it, is ubiquitous.•To me, Patchett’s gift is always how much we end up caring about her characters, their stumbles and pathologies and reunions and falls from grace, as time marches on and they grow older and mostly wiser. She also demonstrates the power, presence, and absence of money in her characters’ lives. The enchanting Dutch House itself is an opulent mansion which functions as an additional character in the story. It is a pervasive presence packed with meaning—not the least of which is that it literally is the paradise from which the children are expelled—and whether it is in the hands of our protagonists or the antagonist, it hovers. Real estate and its meaning and value is actually a theme, and forgiveness and compassion are powerful currents. As in her other books, the narrative jumps around in time and the past—along with the nostalgic memories that accompany it—is always present.•"

1548,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5859754-tina-woodbury,Rating 4 out of 5,"I simply could not decide whether to read this book or not. I thought the synopsis seemed interesting, but prior to this book I had only read one book by Ann Panchett and it was not a huge success. I had a lot of trouble connecting with the writing style of that book and had decided that although others really enjoy her books, she was not for me. To my surprise I actually really enjoyed this book, maybe I don’t need to swear off Ann Patchett after all!Full disclosure – I chose to listen to the audio version of this book rather than reading it. I heard it was the way to go so I decided to follow suit. Tom Hanks is the narrator and no surprise here, he did a fantastic job with the narration!This book is book club gold! The characters are fantastic, so much to explore there. Relationships between husbands, wives, and siblings to dive into and dissect. And then there is the ever-popular family dysfunction, abandonment, and forgiveness to name just a few topics that can be discussed.Everyone in my book club enjoyed the story. It made for a great conversation! One of the more notable things we found interesting was how we all had different visions of the dutch house. Some saw a very large grand house, others envisioned a house that was architecturally beautiful, but on the smaller side. I have no doubt that this was Ann Patchett’s intention when she held back a bit on describing the house so that we can fill in with our own imagination."
1549,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43030143-roxie,Rating 4 out of 5,"To be honest, I'm stumped. My star rating is an arbitrary, waffling 4. The story is rich in themes, scant on plot, reflective and placid in tone. I do wonder if this is a case of audiobook being the most well-suited format, because it seems like the loudest praise is coming from those whose experience was essentially Tom Hanks pulling up a chair and leisurely recounting the events of his life like a long-lost uncle of sorts. While the print version kept my interest and attention, I never became as fully emotionally invested in Danny's narration as I would have liked or expected. Personally speaking, Patchett's Commonwealth was more successful on that front. Both novels track the intricacies and adversities of an unconventional childhood, specifically examining the fallout of a parental figure straying from the traditional path and disrupting the whole family's future in the process. I had an easier time just drifting along with the dysfunctional family lore of Commonwealth, but the quiet background drone of ""where is this going?"" never quite left my brain as I read The Dutch House.That said, I haven't fallen off the Ann Patchett bandwagon. There were things I really loved about the book despite the way it meandered with a wistful directionlessness that reminded me of a much older novel. The undeniable bond between Danny and Maeve, codependent as it may have been, was the heart of the story. I enjoyed Patchett's style of blending time and recollection with such a broad swirly brush, because I think that's often true to the way we see things in retrospect. The repetition of past mistakes—generationally, as well as recurring in the same character decades apart—resonated deeply. The descriptions of the house itself, the sibling stakeout tradition, and the ideas surrounding unreliability/disparity of memory were some of my favorite elements. The full-circle ending satisfied in ways I hadn't dared to predict. Danny all but announces the thesis of his entire account in three sentences, and in those three sentences you understand the shadowy burden he and Maeve carried—so often unacknowledged or misidentified—for the duration of their adult lives: ""Like swallows, like salmon, we were the helpless captives of our migratory patterns. We pretended that what we had lost was the house, not our mother, not our father. We pretended that what we had lost had been taken from us by the person who still lived inside.""Between that and Danny's late-in-life assertion that ""they"" should have allowed Maeve to always be the girl she had been in the portrait, I couldn't help but feel a tad less stumped, a little bit wistful, and mostly just hopeful that the next era of Dutch House inhabitants would recapture much of what was lost in the years that came before."

1551,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/74768849-gayatri-saikia-per-fictionist,Rating 4 out of 5,"The Dutch House by Ann Patchett is a multi generational family saga revolving around three families but most essentially the Conroy's. The Dutch House unravels the story of its namesake house and how it shaped and intricately effected the lives of its inhabitants. With all its magnificence and grandiose, the house brings along with a reputation that the owners feel the need to uphold.Be it Cyril who thinks of the house as his most prized possession and a symbol of his gratification or his children Maeve and Danny who considers the house as their safe place. Their mother on the other hand sizes up the house as something too much and is overwhelmed ever since they set foot in their magnanimous mansion.After the unfortunate and sudden departure of their mother, the children are left in the care of house-helps and soon Cyril marries Andrea, who supposedly is the evil stepmother. How the story moves forward since then with all the previous residents being thrown out is a masterpiece to behold. Ann Patchett brings to us a chronicle of flawed family ties, of bonds that are as strong as blood if not stronger and passionately writes about every nook and corner of the house. Patchett is a master storyteller who presents to every minute detail in such a way that you would not only fall in love with the story but also her words. Maeve's unrequited love for her brother Danny, her seemingly kind attitude to her step sisters and her relationship with Sandy and Jocelyn was unalloyed and pure. Sandy and Jocelyn, who were just house helps gave much more to the house and Maeve and Danny than they were required to. I was however particularly unimpressed by the characters of Andrea because even though she was presented as an evil step mother, the author kind of left it to the readers to guess what made her so. And in this event, i rather had an indifferent attitude towards her, while i was supposed to hate her. Also, the character of Cecile was another character that felt alien to me and I couldn't justify her actions : why she despised Maeve so much later on (i am sure that she might have felt a sense of foreboding because of her close relationship with Danny but I personally donot think that is a reason valid enough to harbor such hatred)The ending broke my heart and I couldn't let it go for a very long time and that proves how attached I got to the story and the characters in all. Ann Patchett entices you with her riveting characters, a house that asserted itself as more than an inanimate object and a never told before story within a story.THANK YOU BLOOMSBURY INDIA FOR THE COPY. ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN."

The layers and angles of memory and the past are incredible constructed. So clearly considered but effortlessly pulled off, and never pretentious. I don’t know how Ann Patchett creates such confounding but still compassion-inducing characters. All of them! Somehow! Her writing reminds me of Alice McDermott’s, and I’d pair The Dutch House with The Ninth Hour. (Also, this is minor, but as a diabetic, I so appreciated the way one character’s diabetes was written authentically but not exploited for its dramatic potential.)Gorgeous cover, masterful writing, but so thematically approachable and engaging...a read I know I’ll keep thinking about long after finishing it.

I did stay up late every night reading it, but the characters left me cold in a way Patchett’s characters never do, and I missed some of the magic in the writing I have become so used to in her books.

We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.”If you keep up with the world of recent book releases, you’ve probably heard by now that The Dutch House’s audiobook is narrated by Tom Hanks. And yes, I heard you just go, “oOoOoOoh.” Your reaction is entirely appropriate. This audiobook is glorious.The story itself, too, is beautifully written and some really top-notch literary fiction. If you’ve read any other books by Ann Patchett, this won’t surprise you either. So basically what we have here is two masters of their respective crafts coming together to make magic. MAGIC.The Dutch House is narrated by the story’s main character, Danny. He tells us about his life, from childhood to old age, jumping forward and backward in time in creative and illuminating ways. He and his sister, Maeve, have been close his entire life. When Danny was little, their mother left — fleeing a stifling (to her) life of comfort to go “help the poor.” So they live in the Dutch House, a grand estate near Philadelphia, with their father, until he remarries a woman named Andrea who has two daughters of her own and absolutely no love at all for Danny and Maeve. (What she loves, it turns out, is the house.)After their father tragically passes away, Andrea kicks them out, and Danny and Maeve adjust to a new reality with no one for family but one another. The rest of the story illuminates the gratingly human experience of nostalgia, old wounds, family, independence, and love.I did find that the jumping timelines were occasionally tricky to keep up with, but once I settled into the format, I began to see how important it was to the overall story, and I think it was a really interesting literary device. I love Maeve, both as an independent character and the way Danny sees her through his own eyes. Again, this is brought to life even more beautifully through Tom Hanks’s narration.If you are a fan of literary fiction, definitely don’t miss this one. And I highly recommend the audiobook."

1559,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50823437-sonali-dabade,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5 starsThe Dutch House is the story of how siblings Danny and Maeve Conroy struggle to come to terms with their situation when their mother leaves and their father marries Andrea, a woman who has her eye on financial security. The center of the entire drama is the Dutch House, which they have admired and found themselves mulling over in the strangest of ways. The familiarity, the unfairness, the mind and power games – they have to deal with it all. Amidst all this, they have to deal with the past, each looking at it in a wholly different way.What happens when time passes by and the two siblings keep going back to sit in their car outside the Dutch house and talk? What happens when the past and the future get mixed up in an unsettling cocktail of emotions? Will Danny be able to forgive his mother for leaving? Will Maeve be able to forgive Andrea for done what she did? Will the siblings find peace?What I loved most about 'The Dutch House' is the fact that none of the characters in there are perfect. Some can be plain mean, some selfish, some poke their noses into business that is clearly not theirs, and some even make decisions that are clearly not theirs to make!Despite this – or is it because of this? I don’t know! – the entirety of this story is a beautiful lesson in handling human frailties. It doesn’t teach you, per se, but tells you as way of example that we make mistakes sometimes – big ones at that – and we deserve to be given the benefit of doubt, even if it is from ourselves.Another beautiful thing about this book is that it, in no certain words, lists out the reasons behind a person’s attitude and gives us everything for us to decide if you like that character. And if you don’t like that character, you’ll at least understand why they did what they did or sympathize with them if not agree with them. It is this intricate style of storytelling that reels you in and makes you stay put. 'The Dutch House' has a story that is well-paced in my opinion and it has layers that you probably didn’t think could kick you in the gut like they do. It caters to the most basic of your human emotions and will seem simple, but be prepared for that punch in the gut. Because if you let your guard down for one second, you’ll be down before you can say, “Ouch!”"

Tom Hanks is the narrator and he does an outstanding job. It is my pet peeve when a male narrator tries to sound female with a high falsetto, and when a female narrator makes some breathy, scratchy voice, for all male characters. Tom Hanks gives clear voice to female characters without the absurd inflections. I walked around with headphones in for two straight days to keep listening to this book, it was that good. Anyone who has an attachment to a childhood home, or hurt from a parent who walked away, will deeply identify with this book. "

It wasn’t *quite* as good as the first novel this author had written, but it was still very engaging, and it kept my interest fully. I liked the characters even with their faults, and I enjoyed hearing about them. This is a quiet, thought provoking novel, that’s shows how a dysfunctional family got along (or didn’t). Tom Hanks the actor read the novel, and he didn’t do quite as well as professional narrators do, but I still enjoyed his performance a great deal. Hanks has a wonderfully calming voice that is pleasant to listen to, and you can differentiate between his characterizations if you are really paying attention well. Hanks also has a delightfully different way to announce the chapter numbers, and I enjoyed all the different ways Hanks could announce them, like he was trying on different emotions or something. It was unintentionally funny, once in a while. Thanks you Tom Hanks, that was fun.Anyway, this novel is a great way to spend a rainy day inside with a cup of tea, relaxing. Don’t expect tons of action and adventure, as this book ain’t it. But it’s still good.3.5 stars, and recommended."

I would read pages and then go back and read them again just because of the prose. Her writing style is one of my favorites. I loved the subtle dry humor and the way the book was narrated.

I may have enjoyed it even more because of my personal fascination with old houses. In fact, I have my own ""Dutch house"" - my grandparent's home in Pittsburgh across from the Frick mansion. Patchett's writing is excellent and the long family drama that unfolds evoked all the emotions. It was a reflection of motherhood even though the narrator is a son, brother, husband and father. I listened to this on audiobook- narrated by Tom Hanks and on regular speed- savoring the slower pace and writing. I give it a 5. "

1567,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62515860-kglibrarian-karin-greenberg,Rating 4 out of 5,"Ann Patchett's novels are always a sure thing for me and The Dutch House was no exception. This complex family saga is character-driven, introspective, and beautifully written.Reminiscent of Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca, the novel is centered around a mansion in a suburban town near Philadelphia. Danny Conroy, the grown narrator, recounts his childhood, beginning on a day back in the 1950s when he is eight and is introduced to Andrea, a friend his father has brought to their home for the first time. He and his 15-year-old sister, Maeve, smile politely but immediately feel a coldness from this strange woman. From that day forward, the siblings' lives, which had not been normal since their mother abandoned the three of them and took off for India, become even more challenging. Danny's father bought The Dutch House to surprise his wife early on in their marriage. Not only was she uncomfortable living in such a lavish space that had all of the furnishings and caretakers from its former owners, but she soon became tormented by being there. What started as small trips away from home ended in one final escape from which she never returned. Danny and Maeve settled into a life with only their father, until he brought home Andrea and and thrust them into another kind of life entirely, one in which they no longer had any control. As the siblings look back on their childhood, they struggle to uncover the foundations that made them the people they have become. They have intense conversations about what happened to them while living in the Dutch House and wonder about circumstances that could have made their lives turn out differently. When tragedy strikes, they are tested yet again, and must rely on their inner reserves of strength to make sense of it all.The Dutch House is written in that slow, intimate prose of Patchett's that I have come to love. There are parts toward the end of the novel, however, that I found lacking her signature precision. Some situations seemed to be tied up too easily. Aside from that, though, The Dutch House was another extremely enjoyable read from one of my favorite authors."

Cyril is proud of his purchase as a surprise for his wife Elna, but she hates the enormous mansion, still populated by the spirits, paintings, Delft mantels, and possessions of the previous owners, the VanHoebeeks. Elna eventually has to leave, abandoning her son Danny and daughter Maeve in the process. The tale of their lives is narrated by grown-up Danny as his father marries his second wife Andrea, and more misfortune is piled upon the motherless siblings. Danny and Maeve are intensely devoted to each other, with Maeve directing, protecting, and making decisions for Danny's life and happiness, and Danny following along while still heading towards his own goals with persistent stubbornness. I could tell the way we felt was exactly the same, like we had nearly drowned and then been fished from the water at the last possible minute.I have 432 books tagged as audio in goodreads, but I can honestly say that this is the best one I've ever listened to. It's read by Tom Hanks and is the perfect match of narrator and story. The Dutch House has several elements of a fairy tale, but the characters, including the house, are much more clearly drawn. The people that Ann Patchett has written about exhibit kindness and cruelty, love and hate, make mistakes and do things right, relive childhood memories and make adult reflections, mirroring us in real life. I lived in this area for several years and found myself wondering exactly where this house was. Maeve and Danny drive there whenever he is home from school, and they sit together in her parked car to view the mansion and to talk about what they have lost, and I felt as if I could do the same. Even if it's not a real house, I can picture it in detail, along with all the people that lived their lives there, thanks to Patchett's skilled storytelling."

1570,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/241108-gayle,Rating 4 out of 5,"Full review at: http://www.everydayiwritethebookblog....The Dutch House is about two siblings – Danny and Maeve – who grow up in an odd but beautiful home outside Philadelphia called the Dutch House. Their mother left when they were young, and they lived with their aloof, inscrutable father and a cadre of household help who raised and took care of them. When their father married a younger woman, Andrea, and then died, they found themselves booted from the house and cut off from their father’s wealth. The Dutch House is about how their relationship survives into adulthood, and their lifelong obsession with the house and the wrongs committed by their stepmother.I had been in a reading slump over the last month or so, and The Dutch House was the book that got me out of it. Ann Patchett is an expert storyteller, and I was immediately drawn in to these kids’ lives and their unfortunate circumstances. I thought the middle third of the book was the best – the part that covered Danny’s journey to adulthood and the evolution of his life separate from Maeve’s, despite their codependence.Ultimately, The Dutch House is about forgiveness and acceptance. How do we forgive those who wrong us? How do we accept that people – especially parents – make decisions that we cannot understand? Sometimes that process can take a lifetime. I felt deep empathy for Danny and Maeve, even as they were turning inward or reinforcing patterns that only prolonged their hurting. While sometimes I wondered whether it was reasonable for them to be angry so many years later, to continue to drive to the house and sit outside, recounting the injustices done to them, in the end I could understand how those wounds from childhood were still raw decades later.I liked The Dutch House quite a bit. It’s a juicy book to get caught up in, and I stayed up late reading it last night for the first time in a while. I am always impressed by the variety of Ann Patchett’s settings and plots, and how convincing I have found almost all of them. I highly recommend The Dutch House – great read."

1574,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/113940275-sue-gardner,Rating 5 out of 5,"A richly drawn portrait of the closeness of two siblings, Danny and Maeve Conroy. After their mother leaves, their father marries a woman with two daughters, who similar to the Cinderella /fairy tale type myths moves in and moves the siblings out of the way. It's frustrating to see but does happen in many families where a stepmother joins the ranks and seeks to protect her own prodigy. The Dutch House is Danny and Maeve's home and continues to be a place they return to even after the death of their father. Maeve is the elder and in college, while Danny is still in high school when their father suddenly dies. The way estate law actually unfolds leaves the reader slightly in the gray arena of inability to withhold disbelief but that's a detail I tossed aside given the format I choose was the Audible version read by Tom Hanks, so I avidly plowed on. Over the course of the book, it is both sad and frustrating that Maeve who clearly had a business head on her shoulders choose to remain employed in a company and doing the books for her brother, not achieving any 'light at the end of the tunnel' rewards other those afforded to a good Catholic spinster. Danny goes on to medical school to spurn their stepmother given he's given a trust that will pay for his schooling and the only means that both he and his sister have to separate their stepmother from their father's assets. The story is about the bonds of siblings and how the death and separation from parents can scar, blind, and maim children left behind to pick up the pieces. It is both sad and poignant in that there was little change that either main character obtained by the end of the book insofar as an arc but then again, who among us actually go on to become more than a spoke in a ever-turning wheel, which makes The Dutch House both a believable story as well as one that is well-told by author Ann Patchett. This book won't leave a reader with a sense that all is well in the world, more like a vague feeling of regret that people act the way they do especially where money is concerned. "

Lubię proste opowieści i nie zawsze musi dziać się w nich wiele, jednak wtedy oczekuję poruszenia moich emocji bądź przynajmniej bohaterów, z którymi mogę się zżyć. Niestety wszystkiego mi tutaj zabrakło. Zachowanie postaci bywało niesamowicie absurdalne, a żaden moment tej historii nie skradł mojego serca. Zbyt wiele tu opisów dotyczących wyglądu samego domu, a zbyt mało ""mięsa"" w postaci wzajemnych relacji, zgłębienia portretów psychologicznych poszczególnych osób czy istotniejszych wydarzeń. Oczekiwałam wrażeń, jakich nigdy nie zapomnę, czy pięknych cytatów, do jakich będę mogła sukcesywnie wracać i jakie skłonią mnie do refleksji. Żałuję, iż tak się nie stało. ""Dom Holendrów"" zbiera masę pozytywnych opinii w sieci, zatem zachwyca ogrom osób. Przykro mi, że na mnie nie wywarł takiego wrażenia, bo bardzo tego oczekiwałam.

Why is it not only on many people's Pulitzer shortlists, it's also on the New York Times bestseller lists, nestled among all the dysfunctional detective serials? I don't get it.I'll admit, the title domicile is fascinating - a grandiose but tacky three-story rural Pennsylvania monument to new money, built in the 1920s by Dutch immigrants who made a fortune manufacturing cigarettes but died out before the end of World War II, leaving all their nouveau riche trappings behind them (including servants) to be acquired by Brooklyn-born aspiring slumlord Cyril Conroy, who moves his miserable wife and two small children into it some time in the late 40's. After the first wife runs off to India, Cyril marries an aspirational young divorcee named Andrea, and dies a few years later, leaving his young children, Maeve and Danny, to battle for control of the Dutch House with their scheming stepmother. Now, I'm not sure I could ever love a book in which the house is the most interesting character, but I can sure enjoy a classy, slightly Gothic soap opera, and I was riveted right up to the point where the fiendish Andrea kicked poor teenage Danny out. I was prepped for a delightfully devious battle between the dispossessed Danny and the avaricious Andrea, but . . . instead, Danny goes on to have a boring adult life and only parks in front of the Dutch House now and then to smoke cigarettes and reminisce over the childhood home which has reduced to a symbol of lost innocence. Based on her previous (and much better) novel ""Commonwealth,"" Ms. Patchett is entirely capable of writing from multiple perspectives, and if one page or even one paragraph of ""The Dutch House"" had taken place outside of Danny's head, it would have improved the book considerably. I loved to hate Andrea, and maybe I would have hated to love her had I spent a little more time with her. She's a lot more fun than Danny. "

It engrossed me entirely in the second half, and I read nearly all of it in just one evening. There were so many things to note in this novel, where the sense of place is so deep and the chronology is played with; I could see it playing as a movie in my head. In the end, I found myself in tears. Sitting on the last page, not wanting the book to be over. I would highly recommend. "

Somehow, several months passed before I picked it up again - and when I did I was swiftly reminded of why Ann Patchett is my favourite author! A few chapters into the story, my heart was in my throat thanks to a shocking plot twist. And like the best plot twists, it seemed absolutely inevitable once it had been revealed. Patchett creates such wonderful, convincing characters - when the book ended, I missed their company."

His first order of business is to buy the Dutch House, a lavish estate in the suburbs outside of Philadelphia. Meant as a surprise for his wife, the house sets in motion the undoing of everyone he loves. Cyril's son Danny and his older sister Maeve are exiled from the house where they grew up by their stepmother. The two wealthy siblings are thrown back into the poverty their parents had escaped from and find that all they have to count on is one another.Why You Should Read It:This one crept up on me. By the end of the book, I felt like Tom Hanks was reading the story of my own family rather than made up characters. None of them are all good or all bad, just flawed humans. I really enjoyed this on audio, namely because Tom Hanks could read me the phone book and I would listen with rapt attention.You Might Also Like:The Butterfly Lampshade by Aimee Bender"

”there are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you'd been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet in place, and for a moment you're suspended knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself.”
there was something about the language and characters that hooked me right off the bat. the premise itself was enough to intrigue me, but i grew so curious to know the next thing to happen in danny conroy’s (the narrator) life. ann patchett wrote dual timelines so well and it made seeing the characters’ continuity and change over the decades incredibly satisfying.this wasn’t not an overly emotional book, but i think that adds to the dutch house’s charm. despite the approachable language and patchett guiding us through the characters’ thought processes, i still felt like i was looking in as an outsider. like danny remarks to himself, 
the dutch house is impossible
. the house truly felt alive. i find it interesting that the characters describe the house with either reverence or revulsion, as if it was living and breathing creature, rather than a glorified backdrop to their lives.there’s also the fact that tom hanks narrated the audiobook LOL i’m confident that he’s partly responsible for how animated danny conroy’s character was.in general, i’m a sucker for interesting family dynamics and this definitely checked that box. unfortunately the only other book i can only name that gives me the same ~vibes~ is little fires everywhere by celeste ng. i’m looking forward to finding more books like these in the future :D i swear the only thing keeping me from putting this on my best of the best shelf is the fact that i didn’t cry........”they were disasters. they were mine.”"

1585,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9911544-donald-schopflocher,Rating 5 out of 5,"Like Commonwealth and Run, this is a multigenerational story of lives lived within an unusual family structure, this time circling around and through a singular house. Much like real life, I suppose, important mysteries have mundane unwindings in the end, but what a wonderful emotional rollercoaster ride to get there."
1586,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4376074-elizabeth-cruikshank,Rating 3 out of 5,"This one was a disappointment. I was hoping for Commonwealth and for me it didn't live up. (I appear to be in the minority here!) I always enjoy Patchett's writing style, although this one was less propulsive and compulsive than either Commonwealth or Bel Canto, both of which I read in a single sitting. But she is so good at creating a rich sense of place, and that was definitely on display here. I always love a multigenerational family saga, and I enjoyed the way Patchett played with time.As for the story itself, however, Patchett was going for a fairy tale (complete with a truly evil stepmother), and perhaps that's why it didn't work for me: Though many of the characters were multidimensional and nuanced, I didn't always feel that I understood their motivations, and their behavior didn't always seem to follow naturally from what I knew of their personalities. I found Elna and Andrea to be especially flat and disappointing, and I never forgave Elna or found her explanation for her behavior redemptive. (I'm not sure if I was supposed to, but Patchett seems to be trying to communicate something about forgiveness and redemption that just didn't get there for me.) I did love that the core relationship at the heart of the story was about two siblings. That's a rare dynamic and it was really beautifully done here. But even that lovely relationship didn't ring entirely true to me; it was hard for me to buy that someone with Maeve's talent and drive—which was on full display as she charted Danny's whole life for him—would be so lacking in personal ambition and that she could have such depth as a person while being so structurally stymied by the great betrayal of her childhood."
1587,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/95217-andy,Rating 4 out of 5,"“But we overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.” – Ann Patchett, “The Dutch House”“The Dutch House” perfectly captures how it feels to grow up and look back. The quote above is one of many astute observations Ann Patchett infuses into the novel that will make you pause and reflect before devouring the rest of the story. Through siblings Danny and Maeve, Patchett explores how shared experiences are sometimes inextricably linked to certain places even if the memories of when, how and what happened there are different. While I didn’t always love the characters of Danny and Maeve, I loved their relationship and reading how it evolved and changed over time. It was easy to relate to the goading, unsolicited life advice and fierce loyalty that comes from an older sibling – especially a sister – and thankfully that made up the core of the story. I found the rest of the novel a little all over the board. Since it spans such a long period of time, it’s only natural that some of the characters and plot points won’t hit the mark, and for me that’s about the last third of the novel. The re-emergence of three characters that were written-off so early and so frequently by Danny and Maeve get way too much page-time at the end, which creates some unneeded drama between the two and dilutes the emotional hit of the final events. Still, this is probably one of my favorites reads of 2020.I’d also like to encourage this as an audiobook listen, because Tom Hanks is the narrator, so, yeah, that’s pretty much as good as it’s going to get."

I have long said that I didn't understand why everyone loved Ann Patchett books so much. I've read three others (to my credit, I keep trying) and my general impression has been that they seemed a bit pretentious -- artsy and angsty in a trying-too-hard way. Enter The Dutch House. I don't know if I've changed or if the author has. Honestly, I don't care. This book was everything. It didn't hurt that I listened to the audio version, which is read by Tom Hanks. He's flawless.One of the ways I judge a book (other than by it's cover -- ha!) is by whether it makes me feel something, and this book certainly did. I hated a few characters (the mom, Andrea), strongly disliked others (Celeste) and adored the rest (Daniel, Maeve, May, Fluffy, Norma and Bright). I desperately wish I were in a book club right now because I have so. many. thoughts. I actually cried when Maeve died. I laughed at other parts. I **seethed** about the mother -- haven't stopped yet.I know lots of people are going to say that the house is a character in the book. The whole ""(insert place here) is a character in this book"" trope feels very, well, trope-ish. And why does the place have to be anthropomorphized to be important? In this book, the house is a crucial setting and that's plenty.In summary, I was wrong, and I'm having to rethink my opinions on all authors now. What an enjoyable way to be wrong!"

Holandský dom je totiž omnoho viac ako len nejaká kulisa, názov knihy. Je to prakticky strojca všetkého nešťastia a utrpenia, ktoré súrodenci Maeve a Danny zažili. Je to prízrak, ktorý ich mátal celé roky aj potom, čo ho boli nútení opustiť. Je to magické miesto, ktoré dalo veci do pohybu a odhalilo charaktery. Na začiatku príbehu, ktorý je zasadený do Philadelphie päťdesiatych rokov, v ňom Danny a Maeve žijú so svojím otcom, pomerne uzavretým a chladným mužom, ktorý citmi a ich prejavmi rozhodne neplytvá, a dvoma pomocnicami v domácnosti. Vďaka starostlivosti a láske týchto dvoch žien, ale najmä staršej sestry Maeve je Danny - rozprávač príbehu - spokojné dieťa, ktoré výrazne netrpí tým, že jeho matka opustila rodinu, keď mal sotva tri roky. Všetko zmení otcova nová známosť. Andrea je Holandským domom absolútne očarená a je jasné, že v jej očiach značne pridáva osamelému otcovi dvoch detí na sexappeale. Stane sa to, čo sa dá očakávať - zaznejú svadobné zvony a Danny a Maeve získajú pomerne typickú macochu, pričom z ich otca sa stáva pomerne typický nezasahujúci manžel. A to nie je to najťažšie, čo súrodencov čaká... Holandský dom je výborne napísaný komorný príbeh jednej rodiny. Rozprávanie muža, ktorý nám priblíži päť desaťročí svojho a sestrinho života, je o láske, pochopení, odpustení. Atmosféra je melancholická, ale nie ťaživá, autorka netlačí nasilu na pílu a nedoluje z vás za každú cenu slzy.

I must be honest; the premise of this book did not intrigue me. I imagined these characters to be shallow and unlikeable. Thank you for proving me wrong. Patchett has created characters with depth and authenticity. Although I read this book, I do wish I’d listened to the audio. I’ve heard that Tom Hanks, who narrates the book, did an outstanding job.The Dutch house, is a formidable character in this book. It speaks to some and pushes others away. It survives many years of neglect and some years it pulses with attention. It becomes a prize and a burden, and symbolizes so many things, especially wealth and belonging. This is definitely a character driven book; their actions and behavior are what makes the story rise. Danny, who narrates the book, and his sister Maeve are both meaty characters that book clubs can really dig into. Oddly enough, it vaguely reminds me of another 2019 fave, The Most Fun We Ever Had, by Claire Lombardo. They are both very hard to describe other than they both focus largely on family and the adult children in that family.I applaud Patchett for getting Type 1 Diabetes right and creating a character who lives with highs and lows. She shows that this disease can come on suddenly, with no warning. The scene that depicts Maeve going low while in the audience of a theater, was done perfectly. Trust me, I’ve been there.Fans of Patchett and first-timers will be thrilled with this release. I personally sold it to a woman at Costco today. I saw her hemming and hawing, so I did my thing.*For more honest reviews like this, please visit www.GoodBookFairy.com*"

If I were rating this based solely on those criteria, it'd be a 5-star. But a number of plot and character elements bogged me down, most notably Danny's passivity and passive-aggressive behavior that never changes, the abundant and repetitive descriptions of the house itself along with excessive use of flashbacks, and the wholly unsatisfying ending. I try not to include spoilers, which in this case leaves me with little I can say specifically. Generally, in my opinion, both Andrea and Danny and Maeve's mother got off too easy (which frustrated me). And neither Danny nor Maeve seemed to grow much as people as they aged. If anything, they regressed, which--while ultimately arguably a realistic portrayal of a family--did not make for the most satisfying reading experience. I understand that some wounds are nearly impossible to overcome, but I didn't buy that in this case. Yes, their mother abandoned them, but their father raised them and they had loving caretakers (excluding their stepmother). Even when Andrea pulled her nonsense, they had each other and access to the most important thing one can have outside of love--an education. Seriously, at various points throughout this book, I wanted to yell at these siblings and tell them to get over themselves and get on with their lives. I suppose I don't have a lot of patience for people who can't move on, which is why I never really connected to Danny or Maeve.But I see many MANY reviewers here and elsewhere calling this a masterpiece, so I concede that my only personal biases have skewed my read."
1595,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10537669-lyn-mahler,Rating 5 out of 5,"What a great read! The Dutch House is essentially the story of a brother and sister whose extraordinary love and devotion provides the structure for their lives. Danny and Maeve are (presumably) orphaned young and lose the family wealth. The iconic mansion they grew up in remains a touchstone in their lives for decades, reminding them of all that was lost. The story comes full circle with what I thought was a very sweet ending.The real beauty of this novel is in Ann Pachett’s incredibly beautiful writing. The way she uses words to create scenes that evoke powerful emotions, even in the absence of dialogue is masterful. The reader intuitively feels what the characters feel. The characters are so well thought out and complex in nature, they could be your own family. You will love some (Maeve) hate some (Andrea) and feel ambivalent about others (Elna) but they are all REAL. Their behavior is consistent with their complex personalities. Even the supporting cast stays true to their characterization throughout the novel.There are themes of abandonment, forgiveness and reconciliation but the sweetest element of this story was the tender care and devotion of Danny and Maeve throughout their lives, of the ties that bind... formed in their youth when they only had each other, strong and enduring enough for a lifetime.I just listened to the audiobook read by Tom Hanks. I loved it even more! He gave Danny the perfect voice and recognized the cynical humor in him. Ann Patchett has a unique voice that resonates with me, and Hanks got it just right!"

The simplicity that comes with forgiveness and strange justice. What a book!"

When a character points out that (paraphrased...I've already returned the book) men leave their families every day and we celebrate them for it, while a woman is vilified for leaving her family, it recast the whole book for me. Was Elna a bad mother for leaving her children? What obligations do parents owe their families and do those obligations differ by gender? But also, what a fascinating story about one house and people it holds.I'm glad I followed my sister's suggestion and listened to the audiobook."

To remedy this I began reading books from the list of Pulitzer Prize winners. These books are uniquely “American” stories in that they have somehow managed to capture the essence of American society at a specific moment in time. As I worked my way through the list I became a better reader but also a better American, albeit, in a foreign country. I’m bringing this up because this book is definitely a Pulitzer Prize book. It reminds me a lot of Updike, Roth and Smiley. Without getting into some kind of comparative lit essay, I’ll say it carries the same weight as those stories written by those writers. Ok. Anyway.This is a book about women. Told in the voice of a male character. There are so many beautiful things in this book that it is destined to become a classic. It has all the hallmarks of a generational saga about a family struggling to find their place in the world. It is also like a fable in that there are many lessons to be learned about treating others with generosity of spirit. It is about class, religion, and cities. Truly, this book has packed it all in. The writing is flawless. The story, intriguing. It only loses itself around the middle when the author seems to have forgotten her purpose, but then draws it all back together for a momentous finish. I really liked this book. It was a pleasure to read and I regret not reading her work sooner."

The prince does not come to the rescue in this one. It spans beyond and deals with its aftermath in the real world.The novel follows the pattern of a powerful start, tiresome mediocrity in the middle and back to a powerful end. There were times when I thought it was futile to keep it going, that contemporary fiction once again failed me in originality, that Tom Hanks was wasted. I cringed at the characters’ unhealthy obsession with the Dutch House, was annoyed by the haughty narrator and despised the league of recurring flat characters. While everybody hated on the stepmother, I was disturbed to the extreme by a narcissistic mother, who ruthlessly abandoned her own children for the adoration of others, misinterpreting the drive with higher calling. Only in the course of the events the author starts cleaning up the mess. By the end there is a closure and no disturbance left. You grow sympathy towards the mother who is flawed as any human being, witness the metamorphosis of the narrator from thoughtless snob to affectionate father, and discern the imperfections of the life as they are meant to be - without fairy grandmother granting wishes in the magical Cinderella land.I am asking to read it through. The reward is awaiting."

I love Ann Patchett books and this was no exception. The story is told by Danny Conroy and follows his life originating in the Dutch House, through his college years, marriage and parenthood. It is basically the story of his family and how his childhood home became an obsession. There is a gothic ambiance, but the character's story gradually takes predominance over the story of the house. Ann Patchett is extraordinary at exploring themes and dynamics in families. How well do you really know your spouse or their dreams? How does abandonment affect a child? How well do you really know your parents? How much influence does a sibling have or should they have in your life? What are the effects of a chronic, treatable illness? What happens to the family dynamics when you acquire step siblings or a step parent? What kind of awareness do children have for the adults who care for them and how does it differ with age? How difficult is forgiveness? I wish I had a reader's guide. This book would be excellent material for a book club discussion. And, it's perfect for those who watch a bit too much HGTV. The descriptions of the house are vivid. Would recommend to readers of all genres. It will hold your interest throughout. "

As this was my first Ann Patchett novel, all I knew was that a lot of people enjoy her books and the premise sounded intriguing. I have a fondness for books where a house is a character unto itself. In this case, the actual object of The Dutch House was just as intriguing as the characters that, at one time or another, resided in it. Patchett's description of the house was exquisite, not only helping to paint the picture in the reader's mind of the building itself but also of the situations within its walls.Family dramas are very hit or miss for me but the fact that this one concentrates almost solely on the sibling relationship between Danny and Maeve allowed me to become fully invested in them as characters. The surrounding members of their immediate and extended family were there only to further the plot but it always came back to the two siblings. Also, the switching of timelines throughout the book was seamless and easy to follow and made for great storytelling start to finish. It reads as though Danny is having a one on one conversation with the reader, allowing it to be a more personal narrative than many modern fiction novels.I now can't wait to read more from Ann Patchett.

As in all Patchett's books a good story with a lot of sense and life, a bit complicated with really well developed and well described characters. My favorite, Maeve, of course. Absolutely loved Maeve. Even the ending made sense.

To be honest, I haven't really liked any of the books she's written after Bel Canto, except State of Wonder. This novel feels like a long, stretched out backstory before the action actually starts, and one of the problems with this exposition-heavy narrative is that it doesn't allow for much ""showing"" (I'm sorry, I'm a writing student, I had to mention it), and feels like it lacks subtlety.  We are told three times that Celeste's dislike of Maeve is just displaced criticism of Danny, something I could have inferred for myself. By the third reiteration of this idea I wanted to scream.  Danny is a boring character and Patchett's prose, though it flows well and is easy to read, is light on the beautiful imagery and turns of phrase I loved so much in her older writing.

This book is objectively very good. It's well written, well crafted, nuanced. I just...didn't particularly enjoy (or dislike for that matter) reading it. Which has much more to do with how the subject matter and characters hit me at this moment in time than anything else. Danny and Maeve are the children of a wealthy real-estate mogul (strike one tbh) who lose almost everything when their father dies and their evil step-mother inherits everything. This haunts them for most of their lives. We hop back and forth between their childhood and adulthood when they park in front of ""the dutch house"" where they grew up. There aren't really any surprises because of this format, which took any tension out of the book.I couldn't help but feel that nothing particularly bad or tragic happened to them. Did they carry a sense of injustice with them for most of their lives? Sure. But that was sort of it? To the book's credit, I think it is meant to be this way, but I just didn't know that it was a story that I needed to read.I genuinely think this would have hit me differently if I had read it at a different time and I did think the book ended well.

Gotta sit with it for a while....After sitting with this for a few weeks I think I'm ready to talk about it.This book was soo interesting. The pacing was different. Some parts that might be not typically ""important"" things had pages and pages on it and other very important things like marriages and births and deaths were mentioned in a single sentence. It made this book feel off balanced to me, but not necessarily in a bad way - kept me on my toes. It took me a second to get into this book, but once I did I could not put it down. I think I read it in 3 sittings - which is remarkable for me and my kids running around the house. I lost a few hours of sleep over this.

It also hit close to home and that was painful.Was it beautifully and brilliantly written? YesWere the characters unbearable at times? YesDid it make me think and think and look at the world through a different lens? YesWould I recommend it? Probably - but only if the person promised to talk with me about it afterwards so we could commiserate and I could talk about my frustrations with the characters."

As beams of sunlight cascade through an east facing row of windows, the narrator reveals moments of truth about the past in the Dutch House. Golden light spills through each sad memory. By the time the story is finished, you close the door behind you and pause on the walkway to gaze back through the windows. “Saints are universally despised by their families.”I enjoyed this bittersweet tale by Ann Patchett. I found it in hardback at Barnes & Noble, then downloaded the Audible format narrated by Tom Hanks. It has one of those easy going paces that make it a great story to read before falling to sleep at night. And, Hanks is a mesmerizing narrator. But, you won't be able to stick to a plan to just read it at night. It will overtake you in the daytime, and before you know it, you will be reading in every spare moment to know the end. “You have to serve those who need to be served, not just the ones who make you feel good about yourself.”The hardback is nice to have, but honestly the Audible can't be skipped. Hanks nails this character! You'll love the story. You'll listen again for the narration.“There would never be an end to all the things I wished I'd asked my father.”"

I already want to read it again for myself and see how the experience differs. Tom Hanks' narration was so good - the inflection, the pacing, I loved it. I was excited to commute every day so I could listen more.The story was the type that you feel burrowed inside, sitting next to the characters, experiencing everything as they're experiencing it. It circled in and out of itself over and over, running between current times and past events and remembrances of past events during current times. I loved Danny and Maeve's relationship and I loved how Mae circled in to start filling the gaps left by Maeve in the end. The house was a character in itself and it was so clever and beautiful how everyone eventually returned after hovering around it for so many years. The love, the anger, the forgiveness... it was just such a human story."

The mother - who has mental health issues - leaves her two children with their father and goes to India forever. Their father remarries a woman with two younger children. When the father dies, the stepmother orders her step-children out of their home.The older sister, Maeve, is strong and independent but her rage is the fuel that powers the rest of her life. Her younger brother, Danny, goes along with her because he adores her. Her anger shapes his life too. Ultimately things change in various ways and everything comes full circle. "

It’s a family saga and the book begins after the end of WW2. It centres around two main characters, Danny and Maeve, and the impact The Dutch House has on them. Told from the view point of Danny, we experience all the heartache and loss, abandonment and bereavement as well as some of the happier moments he goes through in this life.This book’s major strength and selling point is the way Ann Patchett brings the characters to life. Her characterisation is amazing, and you feel the sadness, happiness and utter rage that the main characters feel. Danny and Maeve, as well as the others, literally jump off the page at you! There are no twists and turns in this books, no great excitement but still it draws you in and infuriates you all at once. There were times when I felt so frustrated with the characters and wanted to shake them, but at other points you feel utter sadness at the heartache and abandonment they faced. Whilst it is quite slow paced at times, the writing completely takes you on a ride that you just want to keep on until the end."

Each page is packed w observant details and startling metaphors. Thorough and fascinating characters. I can’t get over how much I loved observing the heroine Maeve through the eyes of the narrator Danny—the oblivious, doted upon, distracted, but loyal, loving younger brother compared by Ann in an interview to a cork floating in an ocean who doesn’t realize he’s in an ocean. Something about him seemed so familiar and true, perhaps he reminds me of many oblivious, selfish, yet devoted boys. Perhaps for that reason, his attention to Maeve and his witness and recording of her life is more poignantly a testament of his love for her, even if flawed and at times distant. In addition to exploring the concept of kinship and home, this book examines the impact of familial and caretaking bonds and wounds; and memory and meaning making and how that changes w knowledge, age, experience, and compassion. Ann was able to capture both childhood and adult memories and perceptions in an honest and truly impressive way. Still mulling over the ending and my feelings toward the mother. That I’m left pausing is part of the point. I wish I had the painting."

Spanning five decades, the story makes for a great family saga as it shifts back and forth between their childhood and the present. Narrated by Danny, the book takes us through how his father, Cyril Conroy, built an enormous real estate empire from nothing, and how things take a worse turn when the young siblings are thrown out by their stepmother.Patchett is a fantastic writer - she has so beautifully narrated the story, given us a slew of brilliant characters, and beautifully portrayed the relationship between the siblings and the various other characters. The book was at once sad, funny, and, heartwarming. Maeve and Danny, and the bond they share, will always have a place in my heart.However, I struggled a bit with the constantly shifting timelines. At some instances, the pace was a little too slow for my taste (but I feel that it's a given when it comes to most family sagas).Nevertheless, I haven't read such a good family drama in a long time. I highly recommend listening to the audiobook narrated by Tom Hanks. His narration is spellbinding; he truly brought the book alive."

That said, I do hope her other books aren’t as tedious as this one was in spots. Still worth my time—I lived in Danny and Maeve’s world while I was reading it, which is always a sign of a favourite author for me. "
1614,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7811312-sarah,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Dutch House has instantly won a place on my favourites list. It is a wonderful exploration of complicated family dynamics, home, inheritance and exile. However, what I enjoyed most of all is the way Ann Patchett describes memory: the stories we tell ourselves and each other, our own family 'legends' and how we think about significant figures from our past. For me, this book belongs in that rare 'literary page-turner' category, brought alive by its memorable characters and insightful, understated writing. I have read and enjoyed three of Ann Patchett's earlier books but, for me, this is the best yet. I'd recommend this to those who liked Ann Patchett's last novel 'Commonwealth', as well as to lovers of 'The Last Romantics' by Tara Conklin, 'Little Fires Everywhere' by Celeste Ng or 'The Goldfinch' by Donna Tartt. The Dutch House leaves a lasting impression on its visitors and I fully expect it will stay with me for a long time to come.My thanks go to NetGalley and Bloomsbury UK for the opportunity to read a free advance copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."
1615,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15647098-lizanne,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Dutch House is the story of a brother (narrator), his older sister, and the house in which they grew up. Since it’s an Ann Patchett novel, what more do you need? The protagonist, Danny, is seven years younger than Maeve, making quite a diff in their upbringing and expectations. She wants security and routine; he takes more risks and can’t understand how she can satisfy herself w so little. Both of them emulate their parents in ways that aren’t recognizable until adulthood and middle age.The Dutch House is awe-inspiringly roomy and grand, though some — like their mother — find it egregiously large. How the siblings leave and return to the house is the basic plot. I’m trying to avoid spoilers. The voices of these characters are as familiar as any in Patchett’s work. Like Commonwealth, I wanted this novel to continue because the characters were — for the most part — warm and complex and fully realized. The only superficial ones are the characters who are not developed, one of whom is a catalyst."

I also fell in love with this cover! It’s a character driven story, and has been described as a modern take on the fairy tale Hansel and Gretel. The titular house is a lavish 1920s mansion that was abandoned by a wealthy Dutch family and bought by successful property entrepreneur Cyril. He thinks that it will impress his wife, but she is overwhelmed and horrified by its decadence that she flees to India to help the poor. She leaves behind her young children, who five years later, feel a sense of loss again when their father gets remarried to a gold digger. He later dies and the children are eventually evicted by their stepmother, but over decades the siblings keep returning to sit outside the house in their car and reminisce. It’s a book about dwelling on the past, wealth, entitlement and abandonment..The writing is lovely and understated, evoking a melancholic, nostalgic mood and alluring setting, so for this reason I’ll give it 3/5. But unfortunately, I didn’t care for the characters - they just didn’t come to life for me. "

1618,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19977850-flybyreader,Rating 5 out of 5,"What a stunning masterpiece! This modern, 20th century version of Cinderella offers the classic elements of a poetic story: A mother, who is too altruistic for her own good and her children’s sake, escaping a dream home to help the needy and the poor in India; a negligent father, who drowns his pain by marrying too soon without considering the consequences; two siblings with an unconventional bond and a cliche step-mother, who throws the children out as soon as the man of the house deceases. All this drama revolves around the one and only Dutch House, a beautiful mansion at the heart of the book.This captivating story narrated by the younger of the siblings, Danny, offers everything a reader needs: A boy and his sister grown up in a dysfunctional family, find true peace and love by creating an unbreakable bond with each other against the whole world. An entire life passes with a broken heart and trauma so deep that proves we never truly recover from our family issues. I listened to the audiobook narrated by Tom Hanks and he deserves a million stars for the performance. It felt like a private storytelling session by one of my favorite actors."
1619,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/369975-lisa,Rating 5 out of 5,This family saga hit all the right notes for me. The brother and sister sitting out in front of their childhood home felt reminiscent of the times that I have driven by our childhood home with my siblings. I will never forget the time my sister made us get out of the car and go check out the backyard because it looked like no one was home. I was terrified but she has gone up to the door and taken tours before so a quick peek in the back was nothing for her. Any book about sibling loyalty and forgiveness will suck me in every time. Tom Hanks was the most fantastic reader. It made the whole experience so much richer.

Linguistically, the writing and dialogue of this book is rich and witty, making the sibling relationship between Maeve and Danny feeling truly authentic. Danny’s narrative tone is so dry, entitled, and sarcastic, that I found myself unexpectedly laughing at his recognizable manner and immersive story. The descriptions of the VanHoebeeks’ “Dutch House” are so comprehensive and ingenious that I almost couldn’t believe that it was not based on a real home. This is the sort of book that, after reading for the first time, one could pull down from the bookshelf and enjoy simply by beginning at a random page. I loved the way that the story flicks meticulously between Maeve and Danny’s ages and phases of their lives, blurring character development, and creating an account that feels authentic to the scatterbrained manner that most people retell their life stories. Just as The Dutch House was extolled to me, I would highly recommend this book!"
1622,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76022455-april,Rating 4 out of 5,"I listened to this book on audio with the wonderful Tom Hanks as the narrator, thanks to LibroFM and Harper Audio. I have gone back and forth with my thoughts on this book and landed at 3.5/4 stars. I love a good family story told over many years and love nostalgia in stories and looking back at the good and bad in people's lives. So based on this synopsis I was very excited, and I would listen to Tom Hanks narrating anything, so those were big factors in my liking this book. Many parts of this story I was riveted and didn't want to stop listening, but then there were other moments in the story where I just wanted the characters to move on and I didn't care to keep listening. I enjoyed the flashbacks to all the family's memories in the house and their childhood, but also wanted them to just move forward at other times and live in the present and look towards the future. If you love character driven stories that really deal with nostalgia and childhood memories then I think you would love this one! "
1623,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1256226-lyn,Rating 5 out of 5,"My rating would be a 4.5 if they allowed half stars.I always feel so secure reading Ann Patchett, knowing that I can invest in the characters and will not end up feeling disappointed or like I wasted my time. The cover was not inviting to me, so I was surprised to enjoy the book, and to like and admire Mauve (the character in the painting). I don't bother to reiterate the plot in my reviews, as that can be found easily elsewhere. I loved the connection portrayed of sister and brother Mauve and Danny. I usually vastly prefer reading a book rather than listening to audio, but hearing that Tom Hanks does the audio (voice of Danny) has me knowing that if/when I reread this for a book group, I'll listen to that audio, as I imagine he is perfect in that role. I had personal difficulty with the ending, which has to do with forgiving the unforgivable, but I consider that to be a mark of good writing, in that it has started in me an inner dialogue about potential forgiveness and going past having been treated badly by someone I was once close to."
1624,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17593788-katie,Rating 3 out of 5,"I liked this book. Despite following the classic fairytale trope of siblings with a dead mother and an evil stepmother who banishes them from their palace (in this case, a gorgeous Philadelphia-area mansion known as the Dutch House), the story's vibrant, interesting characters - especially Maeve, who leaps off the page - as well as tweaks to the trope like Maeve forcing her brother to go to Columbia medical school as a clever way to burn through the education trust their deceased father set up, thus taking the money from their stepsisters, and a couple unexpected character developments (an 11th hour appearance by their mother, a sad, pitiable fate for their stepmother) keeps it fresh, and I was thoroughly absorbed while reading. It meanders a bit in the middle but eventually gets back on track, and while there's no happily ever after in this fairytale, it's a realistic, moving depiction of two siblings growing up, moving on, and realizing that holding onto the past is never going to get you anywhere.

1625,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1535057-greg,Rating 4 out of 5,"This was a beautiful novel. One of the best I've come across in a while. The characters were flawed and fascinating. Facing agonizing circumstances, it was fun and surprising to see what choices they made.The story follows two very close siblings, Maeve and Danny, over the course of their lives. They're raised in The Dutch House, a historic home in Pennsylvania with unique architecture that their father bought, and which may have drove their mother to abandon the family. When their father dies, they lose the house in a way that's so unjust and without mercy it's monstrous. How they address the loss of their father and their house sets their lives on an arc of varying repercussions. But through medical school, marriage, and unexpected reunions, they remain in orbit around the house.The Dutch House is one of those sprawling novels like The Goldfinch or even Lonesome Dove that doesn't seem to be about just one thing. The characters and their choices are what make it worth reading."

I was immediately drawn in by Ann Patchett’s vivid descriptions and engaging storytelling. I think what I took away from this book that drew me on was the close sibling bond between Danny and Maeve. They stuck together like glue during some pretty rough times. I was almost envious of that close bond between them....although it may have been part of why Danny’s marriage broke up. It seemed that Celeste was jealous of that close bond. And boy did I want to give Andrea a piece of my mind. What a horrible woman! I kept saying to myself-ok, now is a good time for their mother to come back. But she didn’t until it was all resolved and they were adults. I wanted to like their saint like mother but couldn’t. Yes I was glad she came back, but still never could reconcile her abandonment. In the end, I appreciated the calm recollection of the past and how spot on it portrayed how we all at times long for the memories of our childhood. Great book!"
1627,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32344696-karen-f,Rating 5 out of 5,"4.5 rounded up. This is my third book by the author and my favorite by a long shot. Commonwealth was full of unlikable characters. Was surprised I read another of her books after that. But ended up reading Bel canto which was a lot better. This was my favorite. Do listen to it, though. The narrator is Tom Hanks and he brought the story alive. May have even bumped the rating up by 1/2 star or more. A brother and sister grow up in the Dutch House. A very non-traditional house full of unused rooms. The belongings of the prior family surrounding them, including art from famous Dutch artists. The walls of the house were giant windows offering little privacy. Probably a metaphor for their livesIt’s a great story of the love between siblings who are really close. Their life takes a turn but their relationship sustains them throughout their lives. This would be a good bookclub or even lit class story to dissect."

If I had never read another Ann Patchett book, I would have read this one solely on that. I listened to the first 2/3 of the book on audio and loved Tom Hanks' narration. Then I finished it on kindle because my car ride was over. Tom Hanks was the perfect voice for Danny. I just loved this book! This is a story of love, disappointment, and resilience. It would be a terrific book club choice. Thank you to the publisher and Netgalley for the advance reader copy."

I found the first half of the novel to be stronger than the latter half - it was gripping and I couldn’t put the book down. I felt the anger that Maeve and Danny were feeling after Andrea came into the picture. I just didn’t wanted the book to end.However, the story went a little draggy in the second half. The story continued through Maeve and Danny’s adult years. I was unable to picture Maeve and Danny in their forties; for some reason, I had always picture them in their adolescents years. I found myself yearning for the book to end already as the plot got a little repetitive. I loved the concept of how the Dutch house impacted Maeve and Danny’s lives though. If you’re hoping for a fast-paced read, you’re gonna be disappointed with The Dutch House as this is a book where its beauty unfolds itself in a slow moving pace in this novel. "
1630,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1432709-julie,Rating 5 out of 5,"5 BIG stars. This was possibly my favorite book of the year. First, it's a given that anything Ann Patchett writes is going to be carefully crafted with deep, complex characters and a plot that unfolds at just the right pace. But what I loved about this book was the universal theme of forgiveness. This story really highlights how we are all flawed and at some point of time, we've wronged someone in our life, sometimes damaging a relationship beyond repair. The message was subtle, but the impact was big, at least for me. My husband also read this story and now when we feel like we're going off into the weeds because someone has done something 'unforgivable' we remind each other not to go all 'Dutch House' on the situation. Powerful, powerful story.Can't wait to see what Ann Patchett writes next!One more thing, the narrator is Tom Hanks who does a superb performance. What a treat!"
1631,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7172918-chelsea,Rating 5 out of 5,"I'm not sure how to describe how much I love this book. This was my first Ann Patchett, and it certainly will not be my last. The way she crafted this story was incredible, not only telling the story of two siblings over the course of several decades, but describing the house itself as its own character, essential to the plot. I did listen to this on audiobook, which may be another reason why I enjoyed this so much. Tom Hanks did a phenomenal job at capturing the essence of the story and understanding each nuance of both Danny and Maeve that made all the difference to my listening experience. I felt each heartache and fear and smile through his narration, and clung to the words as they were part of my own story. I highly recommend this book - I went out and purchased after listening so I could read for myself and discover even more about Danny and Maeve, their relationship with one another and with The Dutch House."
1632,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71387262-cathy-o-neal,Rating 5 out of 5,"""The Dutch House"" is one of the few books I've read this year that I just couldn't tear myself away from. It was the perfect choice for my holiday reading break because I could devote uninterrupted hours to it. The story is centered on one family, the Conroys, who rise from working class to wealthy only to lose everything because of their parents' unfortunate choices. The Conroy children, Danny and Maeve, rely on one another for everything -- emotional support, financial support, shared history and shaping their futures as they overcome hardships and family secrets. Ann Patchett is one of my favorite authors. Her characters are fully developed, rich and relatable. Her writing is beautiful and descriptive. The depth she brings to her characters and the story line allow her readers to immerse themselves in her work. In this novel, she meets the challenge of making unlikable characters redeemable and sympathetic. ""The Dutch House"" is not only a story of family, it's a story of kindness. "

Maybe I'm being harsh on the book, but I feel like if I read the print version, that's how I would have felt. Tom Hanks is so good reading that if the acting thing doesn't work out, he has a bright future in audiobook narration. I mean, he even does the women's voices well. He really does breathe life into the characters and added drama to the narrative.The Dutch House follows a brother and a sister throughout their life and how they bond over their childhood home (although they only lived there for a few years). Their father dies when Danny is still a teenager & the wicked stepmother kicks him out of the house, turning him over to his older sister Maeve. Their birth mother disappeared years before so they are for all purposes orphans. This is the story of their struggle, their revenge & how they reconcile their feelings towards their parents. Not something I would normally enjoy, but Hanks made this compelling."

É tão bom quando o fim de um livro não desilude e é coerente com as personagens construídas ao longo do mesmo.Não é só uma história sobre irmãos, é sobretudo uma história sobre o poder do rancor e do perdão, sobre relações familiares, sobre ausência e sobre o quanto um espaço fisico pode ocupar lugar de memória e consolo. Percebo bem esta ideia de uma casa ter vida, de ter vontade de voltar à casa da infância. Tenho essa relação com uma casa da minha meninice e algumas casas de familia. É um livro muito humano.De todas as personagens, aquela que mais me fascinou e agarrou ao livro, foi a mãe, praticamente ausente mas inevitavelente presente. Isso também é interessante, a forma como é possível construir um romance à volta de uma ausência poderosa."

Myself replied, Of course it is, it's by Ann Patchett. And indeed, this is one of Patchett's best books. The biggest criticism I can level is that it's a little self-indulgent at times, but the characters leap off the page, and are so true to themselves, that any self-indulgence was just a natural part of the progression of the story. I could go on and on about the language and the descriptions and everything else. I could even make a bad metaphor about how picking up this book was like rubbing velvet: it just felt perfect. But I won't. If you like Ann Patchett, you've already read this book. If you've never been introduced to her, this one is a great one to start with.Actually, my biggest criticism of this book is the cover. I hate the cover."

And he does an amazing job and made it worth finishing a book I only ultimately felt meh about. The story started out interesting enough. Siblings Danny and Maeve live through a lot in this book, and their story starts out strong. The Dutch House, its history, their parents and how their choices affect their children, and how Danny and Maeve's choices affect their future... all interesting stuff. But I was ultimately left with the feeling that this book lacked a purpose. Was it's purpose to display a type of forgiveness? If so, the lesson was a letdown. The last quarter of the book was particularly disappointing. So much and so many years being wrapped up, but just so-so. If it hadn't been for Mr. Hanks, I would have passed on this one."
1638,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"Aptly titled after a house, The Dutch House itself is a character just as much as the humans in Ann Patchett's latest masterpiece. This a fascinating and intricate story of what it is to be human, the complex nature of family and the dysfunctional dynamics that proliferate and reverberate through the decades. Danny and his sister Maeve are inexorably drawn back to the house from which they have been banished by their stepmother (cue the ominous fairy tale music because it is apt here), combing their memories for signs and moments and emotion, over and over and over again. The Dutch House really is a tour de force. Patchett's acute understanding and keen observational insights into family and its infinite dramas large and small is fully on display here.

1640,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/102703846-john,Rating 2 out of 5,"Setting aside the idealization of Cyril and Danny as landlords, I'm still not the biggest fan of this book. Danny is unlikable, we get almost no insight into Maeve, and all the other characters are cartoonishly good or evil. I understand that part of Ann Patchett's purpose in writing this book was exploring the idea of a fairytale in this novel, but I just didn't find it compelling. The one theme of this book that I do like is forgiveness, but I think it comes way too late to the story. The Dutch House is an easy enough read I just think it falls short in many ways. Lastly, my biggest gripe with the book. At one point Maeve is driving from 30th st station to Jenkintown and the book says she ""left the parking lot, working her way through the maze of Philadelphia,"" this is a severe insult to the perfectly designed grid of the best city in the world."
1641,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1518558-amy,Rating 2 out of 5,"Well here is a brief breakdown of why I gave this much lauded novel 2 stars. 4 stars for the evocative writing and how the author draws you in.5 stars for the overarching plot--I quite liked the idea of the house as a touch point for all these characters lives and their source of pain and longing.2 stars for character authenticity--who buys these people? I don't. Get over yourselves! Get over yourselves--you exhaust me.1 star for length--Ann Patchett, please end the book. End the book. How long do these people live?! It's 350 pages long and it felt like 800.1 star for unbelievable plot developments and coincidences. I can take that in Dickens but I'm not forgiving of it in modern authors. It just got all a bit too much. Correction, it became intolerable.I do not recommend this book--that probably goes without saying."
1642,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24500612-laura,Rating 4 out of 5,"Finished in one day - a rarity for me. Good story. I have liked all of Patchett’s books, especially Bel Canto, and this one is nowhere near Bel Canto. It was a quiet story of childhood memory, lingering effects on adulthood, questioning of way things were versus how you recall them to have been. Overlaying it for me was this huge question of “was it all really that bad?”, when you put one’s life into a global perspective. There’s a lot that we as Americans can focus on the negative, or how we expected life to be one way, or had it told to us that here’s the perfect childhood you should have had, and then the script is different from that. Especially liked one question when character was bemoaning his mother’s absence, sister reflected that famous men leave all the time to follow their path, and they’re hailed as heroes. Recommend. "

Although Hanks' voice is absolutely distinctive, as he read this novel, I truly felt like Danny was telling his own story about his father, his sister, his stepmother, and ultimately about The Dutch House, which was as much a central character as any of the others, if not more. The house was alive and part of the heartbreak and joy of all it had seen over the years, and what I found fascinating was how each of the MC's had a different relationship with the house and how it changed with time as each of the characters themselves changed. This was a wonderful combination of excellent writing and pitch-perfect narration. I highly recommend both the story and the narration."

This was The Goldfinch-like but without the Donna Tartt pretension™️The way Danny loved his sister so completely that it eclipsed, formed cracks in all his relationships was what slowly split open your heart throughout the novel. Maeve was endlessly fascinating, surprising. The House! The House. More gothic than actual gothic literature with its ghosts and hanging portraits and revenge and property ownership transferring. Ideas of self-sacrifice on a familial-level, of how lacking every person can be in various relationships, yet capable in other relationship. While my own personal emotions response was wavering, The Dutch House is just very well-written, well-paced, well- constructed fiction.( They will try to make this a movie, and I simply don’t endorse that idea).

Of course the writing was excellent, the characters extremely well developed, I think I would recognize the house if I saw it. I was looking for excitement perhaps, and that wasn't there. I will say I was intrigued by the organization of the book and if there is an article somewhere on how Ann Patchett writes her books I hope someone will point it out to me. I started to re read the book and was shocked at how effortlessly she weaved in and out of different times from the start and this wasn't apparent to me reading it the first time. It is a story about a family that the mother leaves when the youngest child is 3. A detached father and a house that holds them together but also tears them apart. "

Tom Hanks is the narrator for this unabridged version of The Dutch house by Ann Patchett and it really felt like Danny was telling me the story of his life. There was an intimacy in the way The Dutch House explored feelings of love and anger for family that was relatable, yet unique because of the way Danny and his sister, Maeve’s, lives were so effected by their childhood home and continue to be effected long after they no longer live there. I found the relationship between Danny and Maeve to be very heartwarming because of the way they so fiercely protected each other throughout their entire lives. Intriguing and yet not a life overly extravagant, I was never bored and found the experience of The Dutch House to be overall very pleasant. "
1647,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/139301-kaijsa,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is the story of a house and a family who lives in the house, and what happens to them even when they don't live in the house anymore. I love books like this, where you just get to know the characters and their stories unspool as you travel with them back and forth in time. Danny and Maeve live in the Dutch House in the 1950s-60s with their father, a cook, and a housekeeper after their mother leaves when they're little. Then their father's new wife and her little girls move in and push them out. The bulk of the story is Danny and Maeve trying to figure out how that could happen and how to let go of the Dutch House. But it's more than that, and it's impossible to describe. I loved it.I received a free ebook ARC from Harper Collins via NetGalley. This is my honest review. "
1648,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1731678-nancy,Rating 5 out of 5,"I have loved every one of Ann Patchett’s books, even the ones others find odd or minor entries in her canon. It’s about the writing— in every single book, even if the plot is unusual or unlikely. Patchett is at her best in books like ‘Commonwealth’ or ‘Dutch House’, family sagas where quirky people are closely observed and things do not proceed as expected. ‘The Dutch House’ really does center around a house, a beautiful old place with a history that has a way of calling its residents home. Patchett turns the reader and the narrator, Danny, around, with some unpredictable surprises, while always remaining true to the the idea that our earliest memories never really leave us. An absolutely delicious read. Five stars."
1649,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3076786-beth,No Rating,"I'm torn on my thoughts on this one. There's no denying that Patchett is an incredible writer and I sped through it. I found the novel engaging and solid and greatly enjoyed my time with it. However, I didn't necessarily feel like some of the characters came to life, namely Maeve, who plays a pretty large role throughout. It also felt very rushed at the end, with huge events occurring and only a sentence or two dedicated to any type of reflection. I'm left with a lot of questions about the book's overall message and know I'll be trying to work it out for the foreseeable future. It would definitely be a fantastic book club pick! It was reminiscent of Tartt's The Goldfinch, Attenburg's Saint Mazie, and Towles's Rules of Civility, so would likely be a hit if you enjoyed any of those titles."
1650,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59785585-vesna,Rating 5 out of 5,"A beautifully written novel that may well have been titled Maeve, the girl from the book cover, whose life with her brother Danny (and as told by him in the first person) enfolds quietly but in an emotionally engaging way. You just can't help but love her character and hope she eventually finds happiness in life by breaking from, or at least making peace with, her childhood past. Her brother Danny's life path is also shaped by their fractured childhood, but he is dealing with it in a different way. There are so many threads that run through the book, above all a sense of belonging (the family house), the ability to be cruel to a child, but also the ability to forgive, and heartbreakingly touching sibling devotion and love.

The story drew me in immediately and I felt an instant connection to the characters, whose lives we follow for over five decades. The Audible version is narrated by Tom Hanks, who is extraordinarily talented. I could listen to his perfect delivery for hours.Memories and regrets are at the center of the book. My favorite passage is: “We overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it is the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.” The Dutch House is complex, layered, and rich. I don't want to let it or any of its characters go. "
1652,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1428024-janice,Rating 5 out of 5,"The further I read/listened into this book, the more I liked it, until by the end I was immersed in the characters and their story. What I loved the most was the bond between the siblings, and how that was demonstrated by the affectionate bickering between them, by the way they sought each other's company, their understanding of each other, and loyalty to each other. And Tom Hanks gave voice to the characters, especially Danny with his dry wit and light sarcasm, in such a way that they seemed very real. While at times there is a lot of sadness in this story, there is also humor. And while there was justifiable anger and resentment on the part of these siblings towards others in their lives, in the end there is forgiveness and incredible compassion and kindness."
1653,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48314484-jennifer,Rating 5 out of 5,"I wasn't sure this book would be for me, but I was wrong. THE DUTCH HOUSE, told through the voice of Danny about his life with his sister, Maeve, from childhood to adulthood, is remarkable. Patchett’s writing is so skillfully done, you glide along like a figure skater on freshly smoothed ice. Danny's voice is pitch perfect, and the audio narration done by Tom Hanks, brings warmth and sadness and humor to add another layer of perfection. Danny and Maeve's supporting cast of characters -- their father, mother, step mother, step sisters, mentors, colleagues, and household help -- round out the story with complexity and dimension. Redemptive in a non-flashy way, this generational drama is truly masterful."

I love these deep character/family studies and the way the characters and their stories were slowly revealed.I read (library) and did the audiobook ...found myself really falling for the voice of Tom Hanks as the narrator, Danny. It took me longer to get through as I ended up mostly listening instead of reading. Hanks did not just narrate, he WAS the character of the narrator. (my only minor quibble was the way Hanks would try to add different inflections when he read out the the Chapter Numbers....I did not understand what that was all about and it seemed distracting to me). 4.5 stars...was a little slow to get going but I really did not mind."

It might seem like change was impossible, given my nature and my age, but I understood exactly what there was to lose....the point wasn’t whether or not I liked it. The point was it had to be done.”I am throwing 5 stars at this one easily. The characters gripped me and felt like old friends. It had powerful messages and moments of humour. The Dutch House is the main character in this book as it is central to the beginning, end and everything in between. I can not say specifically what was so amazing about this book but perhaps it is a sign of a great author. I also would love to go visit Ann Patchett’s bookshop in Nashville Tennessee. For now I will continue to follow it on Instagram."
1656,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/325850-emmy-griffith,Rating 4 out of 5,"Ann Patchett has such a stunning way with words. The Dutch House was full of beautiful writing, start to finish. Danny and Mauve are siblings who suddenly find themselves thrown into the world with only each other, having lost the life they had grown accustomed to.I’m often not a fan of family dramas; I find they are usually filled with characters who have little to no redeeming qualities and are full of self-loathing and, quite frankly, whiny. The Dutch House did not fall into that category. It is character-driven, but not a slow read. It’s a moving story of love and grief, and I would recommend it."
1657,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/128112973-kelly-miyar,Rating 4 out of 5,"I was immediately drawn to this novel by its attractive cover. This was my first Ann Patchett book, and I’ve heard wonderful things about her work, so with no literary expectations, I jumped into The Dutch House with great enthusiasm. The Dutch House explores the importance of siblings, and how only your siblings can truly understand you and your childhood. It also emphasizes the value of a location and how there are certain places in your life that are simply just “home.” While there isn’t major suspense, there are a few twists and turns that sneak up as you go. Although The Dutch House wasn’t high enough to achieve my 5th star, it does hold a rich amount of emotion and I still think it’s worth your time."

Acho que ela tem uma originalidade interessante, suas histórias acabam se desenrolando de forma inesperada, com reviravoltas e mudanças. The Dutch House é a história narrada ao longo de cinco décadas, de uma família que viveu nesta casa “holandesa”. O narrador é o filho/irmão, que conta sobre seu relacionamento com o pai, a mãe, a irmã, a madrasta, a esposa, os filhos e as funcionárias que passaram pela casa. Há muito de abandono, perda e raiva; mas também de amor incondicional, de dedicação, de perseverança e de perdão. Sobre quem somos para nós mesmos e como somos pelo ponto de vista dos outros. Leitura recomendada."

It lacked the suspense of many of her earlier books, I had no incentive to keep reading besides wanting to finish, and hoping it would start to feel compelling. Maybe to scope was too grand, to follow a story from a young boy through his later adulthood. Some of the characters felt underdeveloped and I didn't get the sense I really knew any of them besides Danny, the narrator, and his sister. All that being said, I am sure some people will love this book. The architectural descriptions, the bits of American history, etc. And I didn't hate it, I just had higher expectations."

I alternated listening to this one on audio and reading it and I loved every single moment of it. I was a big fan of Patchett's Commonwealth and this one certainly had echoes of that story with the sibling dynamics. I got lost in the story, fell in love with Danny and Maeve, mourned the passage of time in their lives, and fantasized about moving into the Dutch House. I've been recommending this book to anyone that will listen so, if you have doubts about it, get on the library hold list. If you're an audiobook person (or even not) listen to it on audio because Tom Hanks is amazing!⁠⠀"

I have just had a serious love feast with Ann Pachett’s classical formal style of writing. Ahh...so lovely! The first half of this book was so good that it definitely soothed my bruised feeling about the expensive ($14.99) cost of this ebook. The second half, however, had a few low parts which seemed like too much of the same thing, but then Ann Patchett gave us a few events to shake it up a bit.My main sort of complaint was in the unfolding of the mother. Among such excellent characters, she was just too incomplete for me. Still a good book, though."

I liked it, but I didn’t love it (don’t throw anything at me!). This is the second Ann Patchett book I have read, the first being Commonwealth, and while I do think she does a fantastic job of writing dysfunctional families, this one took me quite a while to get into. I did enjoy it but I just didn’t love it.... it may partly be because I ended up being so frustrated by the terrible decisions the parents made that it skewed my opinion. I will say that the audiobook made it more enjoyable. I’m not really into celebrities but I would definitely recommend the audiobook, because Tom Hanks was a great narrator! "

I think the narrator is intentionally somewhat bland because, as he tells us near the end, his entire intention was to paint a portrait of his sister. And the book totally succeeds at that. Maeve has stuck with me--she's the type of person that, in life, we might think of as average or even a disappointment relative to what she might have achieved, but in her brother's eyes, she is the (wholly deserving) center of the universe. I was really moved by her character and by that perspective."

This book was such a satisfying read - deep and complex relationships and characters, very vivid and unique settings and events... just great. I loved the ruminations on letting go things that upset us in the past, forgiveness and becoming who we really are (not who our family intends us to be.) I even got past my big hang up on the setting (they lived in Jenkintown and the main character went to Bishop McDevitt... which is a real place that is 2 hours away. C'mon. But I got past it... mostly.) Loved it. And just a gorgeous cover and I loved that the cover art was an actual part of the book. "

Character development completely missing, no plot other than people loving, hating, or missing this house (Come on kids, people move all the time. Sometimes to smaller houses. And they have lives!) The plot twists at the end are ridiculous, and since there has been no plot up until that point, seem out of place. Throughout the book, the narrator drones on and on. It’s like listening to a boring person catalogue every event of his life as if reading from a list. So, if you’re tempted by all the glowing reviews and best-seller status of this book, enjoy!

I love Ann Patchett and everybody should do the same, she is a brilliant story-teller! This novel somehow reminded me of “The goldfinch” and “The nix” which maybe shows that it’s not necessarily a never heard-of story - the idea of two siblings thrown out by their stepmother and the mystery surrounding their mother - but that the way in which it is presented makes all the difference."

I didn’t expect to read it as quickly as I did, and I didn’t expect to be so swept up in this family and their lives and drama, to fall for the house that is the ballast in their lives. The writing is beautiful. It’s honest and funny and heartbreaking. Though this story is about a house, it’s character that shone through for me more so than setting. The characters feel like family friends you know so well, you love, you forgive their faults. I was rooting for this team of siblings and wanted them to achieve their dreams and goals.

But my neighborhood book club was reading this book so I decided to give her another try. For such a character-driven plot, I was surprised at how hard it was to put this book down. There's not a lot of action, but I found the book really compelling and I think it will be a great discussion book. I have a few complaints (the ending was a bit unsatisfying, and I don't feel like the mother's reason for leaving her children made any sense), but overall I would recommend this book!"

Put down the book and find an audio edition. Might not want to listen in front of young children as there’s some swearing & talk of sex. As to the story, I was on the edge of my seat waiting for what would happen next. While it covered decades, it moved at a decent pace—I hated shutting it off. I would have listened straight through. The story hit a bit to close to home, probably why I felt compelled to finish it. If you have not-great step-parent relationships, be aware. The conclusion was the perfect wrap up. "

Is it a waste of a talent to choose a different career? What should the balance between my root family and my chosen family be?I love Mave, she's such a loving sister.

I typically really don't like ""slow"" books but this was really fun. The book had lots of humor, even in bad situations, and just like in a really good fairy tale, there was an evil stepmom and two orphans. It is a really great family saga from the point of view of Danny, who becomes a doctor because he wants to spend a ton of money on medical school just to stick it to his father's wife who wants her hands on his trust fund. He has no intention of working as a physician. Yes. The book is full of stories like this. It's really an extremely well written story. "

Norma seems nice; Fuzzy and Jocelyn and Sandy are my favorites; and I think Mr. Otterson and Celeste are the real heroes-loving and caring for these odd and broken half-people must be tough!!!!Mostly, I LOVE Patchett and her storytelling. She makes a house a rich, beautiful setting and an influential character at the same time.

I enjoyed the writing, the story, the characters. I looked for excuses to read it, and wanted to be reading it when I was doing other things. Having said that, it felt like that hug you'd get from your great-aunt, that was affectionate, but with a slightly stiff arm. Come close, but not too close. Enjoy these characters, but don't get too invested in them.

It's the way she creates characters--they are so crisp and clear in my head. The Dutch House is a soft book; I can think of no other way to describe it.

The Dutch House is easily Patchett's most entertaining and accessible novel since Run, and much better than her last, Commonwealth. With the Dutch House, I suspect Patchett is continuing an aim to appeal to a wider audience than she did with her earlier excellent novels, State of Wonder and Bel Canto. The Dutch House is an engaging, character-driven novel about a dysfunctional family and their extraordinary home, a character unto itself. Despite little action, the book's rich characters, heartfelt plot and succinct prose kept me hanging on every word."

Throughout my reading of Dutch House, I consistently felt that it was almost but not quite as good as Commonwealth. However, something happened for me in the latter half of the book that changed my mind. The best thing about this novel is the intricately written bond between Danny and Maeve; the ongoing tension between the two characters is palpable and moving and so relatable for anyone with a close sibling. Perhaps it is because I come from a big family, but no one does sibling relations and epic family dramas like Patchett."
1680,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/892011-jamie,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is a great novel and story of a family. I think it's one of Patchett's best novels, personally, though the frequent switching between past and present was a bit overkill at times, and the death of one of the characters was glossed over when it really should not have been. Other than that, read on, folks!Feb 2021: I listened to this on audiobook and it was wonderful. I was worried that Tom Hanks as narrator would be distracting or even off-putting because he is so famous and recognizable, but he was actually perfect as Danny. Highly recommend!!!"
1681,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30447649-dana-atkins,Rating 4 out of 5,"I will definitely have to read something else by Patchett. Her writing is so good.However, this particular story will likely not stay with me. I liked it all, but did not love much. I enjoyed how the reader was given a lot of “meh” characters; I feel like this is often how real life can be. I also felt like I didn’t have much of a connection to the main character, who was also narrating the story. It seems like I should have been able to connect with him more since I was seeing everything through his eyes. "
1682,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4325630-burnley,Rating 5 out of 5,"As one who is far too attached to her own house and indeed, houses in general, I have been deeply touched by The Dutch House. I love everything about the house, the dour ancestral portraits hanging on great walls, the beautiful portrait of the child Maeve, the first person voice of Cyril as he describes the growing discomfort that residents of the house exhibit, the years of aching for the house while he and Maeve sit outside it smoking cigarettes and reimagining their lives without the pull of the Dutch House. All of which confirms my suspicion that Ann Patchett is a genius."
1683,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21051996-sean,Rating 4 out of 5,"One of my new favorite books. I'm not sure why I liked it as much as I did...likely because I am a sucker for nostalgia, which is the essentially the recurring theme in the book. Patchett made me want to care about every character in the book...which is saying something, considering that I have recently read too many books full of too many characters that I cared nothing about. (I'm looking at you, FLEISHMAN.) Also: I should note that I listened to an audio version, narrated by Tom Hanks, and he should probably just go ahead and start doing this for a living and give up on the other thing. "
1684,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9866118-whitney-gaston,Rating 4 out of 5,"This story had such a real life feel. It is truly about the relationship of a brother and sister and their unconventional childhood. Their mother abandons them, and their father remarries to a woman who only seems to be after his fortune and the giant Dutch House they all live in.I loved seeing how the Maeve and Danny stick together over the years and have a special bond. It lasts them through decades and they stay close even as Danny has a family of his own. It is a beautiful saga of life and family and a raw emotional journey. It was not fast paced, but so engaging. I absolutely loved it."
1685,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7356613-mamey,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book is storytelling at its finest. The writing is so beautiful and much was learned about family and forgiveness. Ann Patchett captures the best details and delivers them to us in a perfect way; not overly wordy or flowery language, just perfectly executed, in my opinion. I annotated this book throughout to point out the most beautiful sentences. This is my 2nd Ann Patchett novel and she has become one of my favorite authors. I will read EVERYTHING she's written and will write in the future. Last but not least, I can not forget to mention this book cover; it's gorgeous! "
1686,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2753358-carling-barker,Rating 4 out of 5,This was probably a 3 star book for me but I listened to it on audiobook and Tom Hanks was the narrator so bumped it up to a 4. Can Tom Hanks just narrate every audiobook from now on? 
1687,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3285053-kim,Rating 4 out of 5,A masterful storyteller at work. Writing that vividly evokes the characters and setting. Thoroughly enjoyed the relationships between the characters. The house is almost a character in itself that has a driving influence on the story. I read the book in print but noticed that Tom Hanks reads the audio version and could just imagine him as the main character and narrator. Haven't come across anything that I haven't loved by Ann Patchett and I'll always be first up in reading any new release of hers in the future. Must get to those books from her backlist that I haven't read yet.

Maeve and Danny together. Celeste. Celeste & Maeve (relatable). Mr. Otterson. Sandy & Jocelyn. Norma. Cyril. Cyril & Maeve. So I guess I liked the characters. And the writing was good. And it had family drama, but without going overboard. And the whole fairytale quality to it. But here’s the problem. I need to talk this out with someone, especially the falling action and Maeve and Danny’s whole MO. So this would be a good one for a book club. "
1689,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/896512-linda,Rating 3 out of 5,"Is it possible???Is it possible to love the writing but not the story or the characters? Ann Patchett puts words together in charming ways. There are several memorable quotes. But Danny is annoying and spineless. Maeve is such a good sister in many ways, but why does she push her beloved brother to be something he’s not? And what about her boss? Why do I think a big secret died with her regarding that silent vegetable vendor? Not sure how long this will stick in my memory. But I don’t think it will be long. "

The writing is amazing, her character development is very layered, and I love a good male narrator. You know a book has hit home when you have such strong feelings (whether positive or negative) about the characters. This story line reminded me of a modern day fairytale with a wicked stepmother and I though the house on its own was its own character in the book! I didn't love the ending but I don't think that really mattered. The sibling relationship was SO true and honest, and one I will definitely keep thinking about."
1691,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/836943-jeni,Rating 4 out of 5,"Relationships, memories, growing up, aging, regret, forgiveness. Growing up and learning that adults are just children in older bodies who make mistakes are imperfect and have regrets, have weaknesses and desires. Can we make peace with the mistakes and choices others made that effect our lives? I don’t know if this book gave me any answers per se but it caused me to think. Side note, I could listen to Tom Hanks tell me a story every night to go to sleep! His voice made this book all the more enjoyable. Five stars for him and I hope he does more!"
1692,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8632733-missy,Rating 5 out of 5,"I alternated between reading and listening to this book and I loved both versions. The language, the story, the love, the beauty, the deep heartache and longing, the honesty and realness. There’s a level of forgiveness of certain characters that seems almost impossible to imagine. Oh, and Tom Hanks as the reader made the audio version exquisite. I nominate him to read all audio books forever.“Neither Norma nor Bright had children. Norma said that childhood wasn’t something she could imagine inflicting on another person, especially not someone she loved.”"
1693,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/101733811-janae-mast,Rating 5 out of 5,"Loved that the house was truly a character. I felt very close to the characters which may have been partially because of it being written in first person. I love that. The morphing of the characters as the years went by was also cool to see._______I loved this just as much reading it the second time! I have more context for Ann Patchett since the first time I read it, and so in some ways enjoyed it even more when I caught glimpses of her own life in the lives of her characters. I listened to the audio version which is fantastically done by Tom Hanks. "

Хорошо написанная качественная книга с хорошей долей иронии, правильным языком и интересным неизбитым сюжетом. Только для меня в ней акценты были расставлены по-другому: мачеха ещё та с…, конечно, но по сравнению с матерью, она просто белая и пушистая! Бросить детей, не вернуться к ним даже после смерти их отца, и при этом, играть роль матери Терезы?!!!! Очень понравились главные персонажи, которые научились жить, построили свои жизни и сохранили друг друга. "

Certainly well-written (as one would expect from Ann Patchett), with engaging characters and a well-paced story. However, when I finished, my overwhelming response was ""so what."" Not sure it was worth the investment, but maybe that's more a reflection of my mood than the book itself. I'll keep reading Ann Patchett, so make up your own mine."

There’s just no false note in this book and that’s Patchett in a nutshell. She has this remarkable ability to make every scene and situation, believable. The characters speak and act like everyday, ordinary people. Sounds simple enuf but it’s just not. i just love her books.I could’ve easily given it 5 stars and reduced it down to 4.5 stars. However, it’s not an entirely perfect book, so I’ll give it 4 stars. "
1697,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8203522-katie,Rating 2 out of 5,This book was hard to rate. I like books that are character studies when their language is really pretty. And I like books that are plot-driven and their language doesn't have to be as detailed. This book was weird because nothing happened. It was a character study with blunt language and it wasn't descriptive at all. I kept waiting for something to happen and then I realized after 75% that nothing was going to happen. I love that Tom Hanks narrated the audiobook.
1698,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/719724-rebecca-heneghan,Rating 4 out of 5,"I loved this...Ann Patchett is a genius in making the normal interactions of a family who lives in a big house a masterful story. I love the relationship of Danny and Maeve and love to hate the horrible step mother Andrea. I found myself putting this down so that I could have it last longer. I have a few unanswered questions so I can’t give 5 stars. I hope, when I hear the author in a couple of weeks speak, I can leave with better understanding of some of her choices. "
1699,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2573912-carole,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is truly a masterpiece of a novel, made even better by listening to the audio version narrated by Tom Hanks. The story is incredibly well told, with a timeline that's fluid but never confusing; the characters are beautifully created and real, full of flaws, loving and living and holding grudges; and the gorgeous Dutch house, which is really a mansion, is at the center of it all. Do yourself a favor and start listening to this one immediately, you will be enthralled."

There were parts of this book I didn’t care for but I’m still a fan and highly recommend this book.UPDATED: I’m re-reading Dutch House for bookclub & upon second reading I’m rediscovering the beauty of the story. I’m looking forward to discussing this novel as there are so many wonderful subplots and topics to explore. 
1701,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9542548-marjie-c-o,Rating 4 out of 5,"A fairy tale unlike any you might imagine. Subtle, beautiful and impossible to put down. Full of heart, observation, reflection and forgiveness. (All I can seem to do is make lists of the story's attributes as it sort of defies concise description.) ""But we overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we're not seeing it as the people we were, we're seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered."""

I just disliked everyone in this story. Such hateful characters. Between the resentment, bitterness, abandonment, selfishness.... I was like ugh! The whole way through. And by the end I was like. Yeah. Right. I know most people liked it but this book was not for me. If I hadn’t been buddy reading it with friends I probably would not have finished this book. "
1703,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/97764752-olivie-blake,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is the sort of book I tend to love most: the intimate exploration of a person’s interior thoughts and the interiority of their relationships. In this case, the primary relationship is with the MC’s sister, though I would argue it is also about a man who becomes his own inscrutable father over time. I suppose I have a little bit of literary voyeurism; I love books about people’s private lives. It makes for a story about nothing and also about everything. "
1704,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5354903-trudy-stachowiak,Rating 4 out of 5,"I’ve always loved Ann Patchett’s books but I struggled with The Dutch House. The characters seemed very real to me and by the end of the book I felt as if I’ve known them all my life. However the plot often confused me. There was a lot of flipping back-and-forth through time as the characters remember events. At times it seemed awkward to me and I questioned what was the point. So I wonder if it was just me, because as I mentioned I love An Patchett’s writing style and stories. "

I was intrigued in the beginning, gold digging step mom drama 👀 sign me up! I assumed the book would stay in that direction and build some kind of family drama plot. It just fell short for me🤷. I didn't really like any of the characters, especially Danny 💩. It progressively got more and more boring to me. I only gave it three stars because I did enjoy Tom Hanks narrating the book 👍"
1706,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1543806-erin,Rating 4 out of 5,"This was a good one. This book is all about the way children work to understand the mysteries of their parents and their families. I love how this family sits around and tells and retells stories and dissects the past. And the strong sister-brother relationship here is pretty fantastic. The story felt just a tad meander-y and aimless to me at times, which made me think: Where are we going? But I guess that's how life goes. My love for Ann Patchett continues."

Their lives evolve around this house and as the years go by the house comes in and out of their own personal history.

This was my first Ann Patchett and I really loved it, start to finish. I haven't read a ton of narratives about sibling relationships - the central connection at the center of this story. If that relationship + an old house + a lot of smoking + centrality of women characters interests you - please read this!"

The descriptions of grief, revenge and redemption were so completely spellbinding I was hooked as soon as I began the book 3 days ago. Reading a book in 3 days is not something I find myself doing very often, so that alone speaks to the way the writer was able to capture my soul. Truly beautiful, heart wrenching and tragic. This felt like a story of all of us, finding our way home."

Lo que sí puedo decir es que con esta historia me ha ganado. Lo que más me ha gustado es esa relación tan especial y hermosa entre los dos hermanos. La única pega, me hubiera gustado saber más de algunos personajes, en concreto conocer más sobre la vida de Maeve fuera de su trabajo y Danny.Una última cosa, lo he leído en digital, pero no descarto comprarlo en físico porque la portada me parece preciosísima 😍"
1711,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51431004-caroline,Rating 5 out of 5,"I'm glad I listened to the audiobook version of this, as Tom Hanks did a great job with the narration and made the main character more likable than he would otherwise be. It was a bit slow moving at times but then it became more interesting in the second half of the book. At times sad, at times maddening, at times funny...by the end it made me think about relationships and how we value locations and the people in them."

I kept waiting for something to happen or something to explain things, but it was just a random report of these siblings, their life and obsession with the house they grew up in. Stories like these live from you being interested in the lives of the characters and I can't say I cared much about anything.I have a suspicion that I would have DNFed out of boredom or lack of interest if I didn't have Tom Hanks narrating it to me."

I often found myself thinking, “This is Tom Hanks narrating the story”, it was distracting to me. The story however was magnificent. How Patchett the master she is, captured the convoluted dynamics of family emotions... the love, the betrayal, the anger, the resentment, the fear, the forgiveness...Your heart will open to the frailty...., your heart will cry to humanness of it all..."

The characters were so well developed and the story was very real. Something that has really stuck with me after finishing the book is the idea of revisiting past hurt, loss, or misfortunes and how that affects us in the present. This book was very powerful and was a good jumping-off point for introspection. I highly recommend The Dutch House."

Only thing I didn’t love was how Maeve and the housekeepers put the mom on a pedestal and it felt like the author was trying to justify her actions when she left her children! I don’t agree with the “she’s the best person I ever met” narrative at all. She was selfish and wanted to do what she wanted to do. That being said, Danny wasn’t having it with her and I respected that. Loved how it ended. "

The story , the characters, the house .. everything is extremely well written. Loved how the author has captured the threads of each relationship so well. So many sentences in the book made me pause , think myself, makes me want to pen it down in a special diary , so that I don’t lose this perspective. One of the few books I would want to read again. "
1717,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20773512-maureen-stapleton,Rating 5 out of 5,"A modern retelling of the Hansel and Gretel fairy tale, except in this version there’s not a house in the woods, but a mansion in the Philadelphia suburbs. More than that, this is a love story between a brother and a sister. It showcases the sacrifices the sister makes to help her brother become successful, and how the bond they have rises above the evil machinations of their stepmother. Beautifully written. I have given this book to many friends and family and implored them to read it."
1718,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22495169-debbie,Rating 5 out of 5,"I loved this wonderful, beautiful book. I do not have the words to say why. The Dutch House is really the main character. It is in the midst of every part of the story, representative of family-whether whole, fractured, dysfunctional, whatever-the house stands, sees and absorbs all. I am crazy about Maeve. I so relate to her, her drive, her humor and enthusiasm. She deserved to be hero-worshipped by her brother, who narrates the story. Every character was real to me. A truly special book."
1719,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/719759-pam,Rating 4 out of 5,"This story of a family that spans several decades has themes of abandonment, betrayal, greed, and forgiveness. It is a page heartbreaking and endearing because there’s so much to the emotions the two siblings face as they try to move on from deep wounds. Excellently written. A little bit of language, but not too much as to turn you off. There were some loose ends about adult relationships that were still left unresolved, but that’s part of life, I suppose. I’d give it 4.5 stars"
1720,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4924751-elise,Rating 4 out of 5,4.5 stars with a .5 star for Tom Hanks' hypnotic narration. This is a novel about so many things other than the house that the house is a red herring. The main theme is the destruction wrought by men who make decisions for women. Ann Patchett's use of language made me feel that deep sense of well being I would get when my cat would deign to sit on me and purr as if this was a small perfect moment we could both enjoy. She is a treasure for sure.

Tom Hanks did the reading (this was an audio book for me). However, I got lost in the purpose of the book. Not the story … I followed that just fine. Brother and sister, mother leaves, Dad marries again with two half sisters moving into the house, brother and sister don’t like new wife, blah, blah, blah. Family drama is simply not my preferred storyline."
1722,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22607470-lilly,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5 🌟 First off- loved the audiobook. Tom Hanks proves he’s just as good a voice actor as a face actor. Secondly, really liked the writing and the depth of character. There were some described scenes Rabat were so clear! What I couldn’t get over was that it’s just these privileged kids still rehashing the same trauma for the entirety. “Hey, that’s MY house!” Still enjoyed it, regardless of the temper tantrums. "

However, the main character of this book is The Dutch House, which, in all its glory, holds power over all the inhabitants who have ever lived there. Such an amazing story with the beautiful writing I've come to expect from Patchett. Now I have a book hangover! How do I start another book after this?"
1724,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4983650-serena,Rating 5 out of 5,"Patchett’s writing is so absorbing, I hate it when the story ends. This family saga meanders to a conclusion that surprises, but is somehow expected at the same time. The observations of characters, particularly the relationship of Maeve and Danny is masterful. This family will stay with you, despite feeling something like hate for some of their choices. A truly lovely story. "

1728,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/679681-erika,Rating 5 out of 5,I started this in print but 10% in switched to audio. It turned into the best way to consume this book because Tom Hanks is the perfect narrator (shocking!). A story of what could’ve been and how people find new paths. Of partially functional and dysfunctional families. Loved the pretty flawed but sensible main character Danny and his frank and selfless sister Maeve.

I loved the brother/sister relationship but the supporting characters were more annoying and were distractions. I did not care for the mother in the story and she drove me bonkers. Her character left me wanting, which knocked the story down a star. "

Basically it's about an evil stepmother, a rather special family home in Philadelphia and the psychological effects of disinheritance. I appreciate that it's very well written and the audio narrative by Tom Hanks is marvellous, but I felt the story fell a bit flat for me: I was expecting more twists."

Listening to Tom Hanks narrate is one of the most relaxing things ever! I wish he narrated more books!The story is a slow burn but sooooo worth the wait. All the characters, the good and the bad, all the places the author describes, make it feel like you are in the book. I love that. "
1734,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32387677-brooke-nuzie,Rating 3 out of 5,"For the record, I’d like Tom Hanks to narrate all my audiobooks. That’s what saved this one for me. While beautifully written, it just was not my type of book. Had I been reading it, it would have taken me a while to get through (though the 10 hour audio was no easy feat either). Still, a beautiful story of the life of a boy into a man. "
1735,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/112513712-nancy,Rating 2 out of 5,"Lacklustre in all aspects- writing, plot line and character development. The architecture and meaning behind the ‘Dutch House’ seemed to be the foundation for the story but I struggled to visualize or be captured by any of Patchett’s descriptions of it. Failed to finish.Also so over the cliche evil stepmother character."
1736,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/950170-kristen,Rating 4 out of 5,"I closed this book and said “what a strange story.” Not that the story was strange, but that it just came into Patchett’s head as a story to tell. Fundamentally good read- just a good old story of a family- mostly the relationship between a sister and brother-with disfunction, history, love and loss."
1737,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,This started slow but then grew on me page by page until I was utterly invested in the lives of these complicated characters. Complicated in a relatable way. These people live on our streets and maybe even in our own homes. Loved it. (Bonus is that it is set in Elkins Park so the familiar references were fun).
1738,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/91215881-chelsea,Rating 3 out of 5,"Wow. I’m not typically one to enjoy audiobook, but Tom Hanks (America’s Treasure) read this one, and it was magical. He truly made the story come alive. This book follows the lives of a brother & sister across several decades. Nothing too wild happens in the plotlines, but the character development is superb. Such a beautiful story so beautifully told."
1739,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19977072-alex-myers,Rating 5 out of 5,"Exceptionally good. The time, the people, the conflict... everything in this book had sharp edges and satisfying plausibility. And the place... the place was the real main character here; the house itself and the surrounding neighborhoods resonated deeply. I liked the structure of the narration, the way the move through time wasn't always linear. Deeply satisfying and a pleasure to read."
1740,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51194969-sulata-dhakal,Rating 5 out of 5,"*Audio version*This book was made so much better by Tom Hank’s Narration 🧡It has full spectrum of emotions and all those quirky characters with their dry humors. Loved it. The story goes for five decades and in the course of time you’ll love them, hate them, forgive them and accept them. Beautiful book about acceptance and forgiveness.MUST READ OR LISTEN"
1741,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63287307-heather-bassett,Rating 4 out of 5,"Its 'A Series of Unfortunate Events' for adults - clever orphans fending for themselves after being denied their rightful inheritance by a self-centred guardian, with mystery surrounding their parents. I'd really give it 4 1/2 stars, and it would have been 5, but I found the very last seen too much of a fairytale finish."
1742,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5889327-riitta,Rating 5 out of 5,"4,5 stars, 5 stars to Tom Hanks as narrator. I usually avoid long audiobooks, but this time I didn’t want to stop listening. I loved everything about this book, how the story unfolds, the characters and how it made me feel. Patchett is such a great writer, and if there were an Oscar for best audiobook narrator, Tom Hanks should get it."
1743,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15500129-esther,Rating 1 out of 5,Tot blz 80 gekomen en toen had ik er echt geen zin meer in. Langdradig en zoetsappig. Karakters zijn weinig sprankelend. Misschien kunnen lezers lekker wegmijmeren bij dit verhaal maar mij lukt het niet.. Ik ga mezelf echter niet forceren om het uit te lezen want er zijn genoeg andere leuke boeken :)
1744,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12785794-velvet,Rating 5 out of 5,"I really enjoyed this book! I listened to it and while I love Tom Hanks as an actor, I wasn’t sure I’d like him as a narrator. Maybe it was that the story is told in the sons voice, or that it’s Tom Hanks, but he was perfect and I was very caught up in the story. One part even made me tear up a bit, just thinking about life..the good and the bad. "
1745,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"My first Ann Patchett read was Bel Canto a while ago, which I loved! This book is very different, a family saga centering around a house. I loved Tom Hanks' narration, which seemed to have a cheeky edge, especially when announcing new chapters! It's a gentle read, with well drawn characters, and an easy listen."
1746,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29018967-rachel-vivio,Rating 5 out of 5,"I loved the story because it was simple yet complex, if that makes sense, and the characters were so interesting and easy to love! I'm looking forward to reading more by Ann Patchett because this was such a nice, refreshing read. Also the audiobook version is narrated by Tom Hanks, so getting to listen to him for 9+ hours made me feel very spoiled; he did amazing!"
1747,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5309480-ivy-kaprow,Rating 3 out of 5,"I listened to this because it’s narrated by Tom Hanks. It’s told as a story and tends to jump around from the time the protagonist is a young boy, to an adult, to a high school student, and so on and so forth. I think if I read it I wouldn’t have enjoyed it as much but listening to Mr. Hanks really felt like I was listening to someone tell me their life story. "
1748,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/82708036-david-whitinger,Rating 4 out of 5,"Enjoyed this very much. Brought back memories of my wonderful childhood and the bond I share with the two sisters that spent almost all of our childhoods together in a quirky home that to this day, we love to reminisce about. Probably a 4 1/2, and definitely a book I will hold onto and share with my children and my siblings as well. TYA!"
1749,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15021972-jennifer-rucker,Rating 5 out of 5,"Can Tom Hanks PLEASE narrate ALL of The books on my audio list? His voice lent the perfect feel to this novel. I enjoyed this book so much. I love love love old houses, so this book intrigued me. It was quirky, but perfectly kept me interested. In fact, now that I’m finished, I’m finding myself missing the characters. I can’t remember the last time I could say that about a book! "
1750,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75047428-robyn-orr,Rating 4 out of 5,I will give this a solid 4 1/2 stars. It took a while for me to get into it because it is a bit slow despite crossing about 50 years of time. But it is written so beautifully and has such interesting things to think about is definitely worth the read. This would make a great book club book with lots to discuss and with quality writing.
1751,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17872684-leticia,Rating 4 out of 5,"Li esse livro sem ter ideia do que a história iria se apresentar, o que me deixou ainda mais envolvida na história!Como foi bom acompanhar esses dois irmãos, a partir do olhar Danny, ainda que minha personagem favorita tenha sido a Maaeve. Foi muito divertido tentar imaginar o ambiente desta casa.O final da história é arrebatador e terminei muito emocionada."
1752,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/849475-barb,Rating 4 out of 5,"I was very reluctant to listen to this audiobook because Tom Hanks narrates and I knew I'd have a difficult time imagining his voice as anyone other than himself. And I did. However, I'm really glad I listened, I loved the story. Ann Patchett is an expert and this story is just the kind of character driven family story that I love."
1753,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/109066249-david-bylenga,Rating 4 out of 5,"I liked this one! First 1/4 was a bit blah to me, but by Part II and III I was super into it. I was entranced by the idea of a symbol that holds SO much weight to a family. And then to see what happens when the symbol is exposed for what it really truly is when all that is propping it up is taken away. Gonna have to read some more of her novels!"
1754,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/111434522-angel-torres,Rating 5 out of 5,"Such an honest and beautiful book. The characters feel very real while not raw and the progression of the story is similar to that of our lives while not suffering from slow pace or lack of understanding. Very well written, ingeniously crafted and overall a rich and gorgeous story of family, love, resentment, of purpose and life itself."
1755,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/103995549-toni,Rating 4 out of 5,"I have been avoiding this book for three years, only because I was not too fond of the cover and the historical fiction genre. Still thinking about how ""historical"" this book is, besides the plot that is during the '50s and '60s. There were no other elements to say it strongly fits into historical fiction. "
1756,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3190759-kimberly,Rating 4 out of 5,"Since their childhood, the Dutch House has been a central figure in Maeve and Danny’s lives. While its elegant and elaborate rooms attract some, the Dutch House brings out the worst in others. Danny brings us through the years, the house sometimes closer and sometimes farther away, but always a presence that he and Maeve can’t seem to shake. "
1757,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/117997-kris-patrick,Rating 5 out of 5,"I only read a couple arcs a year. Copies that I acquire through extraordinary luck, not because I hold any sort of literary or social media influence. It’s an exciting thrill.... then it’s a lonely experience because you’re dying to talk about the book with other people but you can’t! "
1758,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/766602-jennifer,Rating 5 out of 5,"I loved this book so much I added the audible version so I could listen to it in the car, not realizing it was narrated by Tom Hanks who reads it in way that make you feel like you are inside the book, living along side Danny and Mauve and the Dutch House. "
1759,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13440658-zoe-cattolico,Rating 3 out of 5,"FYI, the audiobook is narrated by Tom Hanks. Otherwise, love Ann Patchett’s writing. Though I felt the story was lacking and trying to cover too many years in too short of pages. It seemed inconsistently over-detailed about some plot points and brushed over others that seemed way more interesting. "
1760,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27707009-rick,Rating 5 out of 5,What a terrific book - I felt as if I could visualize the house and that I knew all the main characters. Such a beautiful story about a brother-sister relationship that lasted almost 50 years. This is a must read.
1761,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1692287-stacy,Rating 3 out of 5,"I liked this book at first, but there was very little to it. I kept waiting for something to happen, but then it would go to a flashback or the main characters would sit in the car staring at the Dutch house for the hundredth time. "
1762,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"3.5 stars. Very well written, but too many unanswered questions in this story. Not to mention how unrealistic the plot is. Yet, a joy to read. The best thing about this book, still, is its cover. "
1763,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7618467-janice-mcquaid,Rating 4 out of 5,"The generational novel is beautifully written and I enjoyed following Maeve and Danny's journey. Typical of Ann Patchett, this book takes it's time and there are many side tracks. If you're a fan, you won't mind the detours. "
1764,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1611637-amy-wright,Rating 5 out of 5,To give this 5 stars doesn't even begin to do it justice. Another 10 star story woven as only Ann Patchett can. She breathes such life and depth into each of her characters and the ones in this book are no exception. I am tempted to simply pick the book back up and begin reading it again. 
1765,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38189593-kristy,Rating 5 out of 5,"I loved this read. It was such an endearing read about the sweetest sister/brother relationship.

1766,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4647089-celeste,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.25 weird and wonderful. i loved how the house was such a character in and of itself as well as the intensity of the sibling quasi-orphan relationship. In fact, all the various and sundry relationships. "
1767,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5483382-jane,Rating 4 out of 5,"Why did I enjoy this so much, even though nothing much actually happens? Perhaps because it's such an unusual premise and the characters were so accessible.Tom Hanks was so perfect as the audio book narrator. "
1768,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6681877-laura-macy,Rating 4 out of 5,"As the title implies, the action and the characters revolve around the Dutch House and its inhabitants, past and present. The novel kept my interest start to finish, and the descriptions made me wish I could visit the Dutch House myself."
1769,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,What a great book on which to meet my reading challenge for 2019! Can this woman write or what?! Always such exquisite prose and dialogue. And what a unique story. So many integral characters. I loved it!!
1770,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/593392-carolyn,Rating 5 out of 5,"This novel reads like a memoir. There are more than 2,000 reviews already, so I won't bother with a detailed description of the plot and style. I enjoyed every minute of the story and as a librarian, I have to say it would make an excellent book club choice. "
1771,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5025127-chelsea-foshee,Rating 3 out of 5,"I honestly was only interested in this book because I knew Tom Hanks recorded the audiobook so I wanted to listen to him read it. The story was ok, a little slow at parts, but I love to ""watch"" a family grow and change over the years."
1772,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5167936-patrick-hackett,Rating 3 out of 5,"Ann Patchett is a magician with words -- I feel like I too have lived in the Dutch House central to the story. But I struggled to connect or truly empathize with Danny or any of the characters, and the ending felt flat. 2.5 stars."
1773,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9310118-jeimy,Rating 4 out of 5,Look at us: Undone by a house.That quote best sums up the plot of the book as the protagonists are still tethered to their past in the titular Dutch House.I highly recommend the audiobook read by Tom Hanks. 
1774,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/178121-amy,Rating 5 out of 5,"AUDIOBOOK Review - Wow. I loved Ann's style of writing, so fitting with the head dialogue of an individual person, relaying snatches of conversation, sharing moments without having to fit a chronology. I loved the story.

1777,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"Loved Maeve nurturing and caring nature towards her brother, Danny. Can’t understand theirs mom’s personality- who leaves their kids behind to serve poor?? Tom Hank’s voice added more impact to the audible."
1778,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4029311-cynthia,Rating 4 out of 5,This book is quite slow to get into. I listened to it and that was a game changer because Mr. Tom Hanks told me the story!!! I don’t know if the physical book would have held my attention as much as Mr. Hanks! I recommend the audiobook as it is an enjoyable listen. 
1779,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9681647-sue,Rating 5 out of 5,This book has been on the bestseller list for quite a while. I like Patchett’s writing. It was about “a house” and the family that occupied the house. It isn’t thrilling or exciting but it’s very thoughtful and well written. I’m putting more Patchett on my reading list.
1780,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22817184-christopher-febles,Rating 4 out of 5,"Finally - a book really deserving of four stars, maybe 4.5. Lovely writing. Great narration. Interesting, believable, smart and funny characters. Sad and winding and intricate storyline. Exceptional."

1783,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22536973-kristine,Rating 4 out of 5,"A terrific book that primarily centers around the bound between a brother, Danny and his sister, Maeve. It is much more complex then that, but it is the heart of the book to me. The only reason I gave the book 4 instead 5 is b/c of part of the ending. Excellent "
1784,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17408049-lynne,Rating 5 out of 5,"I really enjoyed listening to this book performed by Tom Hanks. The story was interesting, it was more about a family than a house. Class issues and perception is not always reality are some of the themes."
1785,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6022282-michelle,Rating 5 out of 5,Loved this audiobook. I think this might be my third audiobook and Tom Hanks narrated it and made it even better.

1786,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1299766-karen,Rating 5 out of 5,Another 5 star read by Ann Patchett. Looking forward to discussing with my bookclub. Review to follow.....Ann Patchett is the master at family drama. She can take an issue that in other author’s hands may be boring. The Dutch House lives up to it’s hype. Definitely a 5 star read!

His voice was just perfect for it. Listening to it forced me to slow down and take in all the subtleties of the writing. Just amazing and heartbreaking."
1789,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/97427032-dj-ruby,Rating 4 out of 5,"It was a good idea to have this written in first-person. It gave a feel of being there. I wish there had been more imagery, but the story more than made up for that. It was another take of the Cinderella tale, but there was a lesson in letting go of anger in it."
1790,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10937376-julie-anderson,Rating 5 out of 5,"Wow, this is the best book I have read in awhile. I listened to most of it and Tom Hanks is the perfect narrator for the story, but then I switched to reading the book and I could still hear him in my head."
1791,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/308927-amber,Rating 5 out of 5,I rarely listen to fiction on audio but Tom Hanks is a fantastic narrator and does an amazing job telling the story of Danny and Maeve. I liked these characters immensely and will surely listen to this again someday to so I can spend more time at the Dutch House.
1792,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12711189-kelly-fuddy,Rating 5 out of 5,My favorite by Ann Patchett yet; a masterpiece. Every character is equally sympathetic and equally flawed. This story tells us at the sameTime that no one really changes and also that we can change quite abruptly when we let go of the past. A deep delight. 
1793,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/99718712-got-twins-need-coffee,Rating 4 out of 5,I really enjoyed this book. The family dynamic was well done and with all of the details around the house itself you felt like you were there.

1796,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2277142-marion,Rating 4 out of 5,"4 to 4.5 stars. A complex family drama that is told from the perspective of a a boy and his sister who suffer emotional and financial highs and lows in life. A deeply felt, compelling read."

An unforgettable brother/ sister relationship, a house as a significant player, regret, resentment, revenge ... this book has it all. In the middle, things got a bit slow even for me, but the ending made me love it as much as I did in the beginning.Also, that cover art!Excerpts of incredible writing: Over the course of the next two months, our mother was gone for two nights, then four nights, and then a week. Maeve started getting up in the middle of the night to check our parents room and make sure she was still there. Sometimes our mother was awake, and she would see Maeve at the door and lift up the covers and Maeve would float across the room to the bed without making a sound and slip into the warm curve of her body. She would fall asleep without thinking, her mother’s arms around her, her mother’s heartbeat and breath behind her. No other moment in life could match this.She was turning into a ghost. When week she was there, then she was paler, everything deteriorated so fast. We were all folding up. Mommy would come home and cry for days. I would go and sit with her in her bed after school. Sometimes you’d be in the bed with her, playing. Whenever dad was home he always looked like he was trying to catch her, like he might as well have been walking around with his hands out. Sandy and Jocelyn and fluffy, they were all nervous as cats by then, but no one talked about it. When she was gone it was unbearable and when she was home it was unbearable in a different way because we knew that she was going to leave again.(While watching act two of the nutcracker ballet, his son whispered, “how can it be so long?“)I looked at him helplessly and mouthed the words “no idea.” Celeste and I had made a few halfhearted attempts to get the kids to church when they were young, and then we gave up and left them in bed. In the city of constant stimulation, we had failed to give them the opportunity to develop strong inner lives for those occasions when they would find themselves sitting through the second act of the nutcracker. “When she started walking towards the car I thought I was having a heart attack. I felt an actual pain in my chest just seeing her again, and it’s been how many years since she threw us out?” “27.” “That’s enough, isn’t it? We don’t need to do this. We can go someplace else. We can park at the Arboretum and look at the trees.”Habit is a funny thing. You might think you understand it, but you can never exactly see what it looks like when you’re doing it. I was thinking about Celeste and all the years she told me how insane it was that Maeve and I parked in front of the house we had lived in as children, and how I thought the problem was that she could never understand.I was sitting on the kitchen floor, screwing a series of shallow wooden trays I’d made onto runners in the bottom of each cupboard so the pots and pans would be easier (for Maeve) to pull out. Kevin sat beside me and handed me the screws as I needed them, and Celeste, who was forever in motion that summer, stopped for a minute and watched me, her hands full of flowers. “I’ve always wanted those,“ she said, as if in wonder that I had even known such things existed. I put down the power drill. “Really? Did I know that?”There is a finite amount of time. Maybe I understand that better now. I wanted my mother back since I was 10 years old, and now she’s here. I can use the time I’ve got to be furious, or I can feel like the luckiest person in the world.“ what kind of a person leaves their kids?”“ Men!” Maeve said, nearly shouting. “Men leave their children all the time and the world celebrates them for it. The Buddha left and Odysseus left and no one gave a shit about their sons. They set out on their noble journeys to do whatever the hell they wanted to do and thousands of years later we are still singing about it. Our mother left and she came back and we are fine. We didn’t like it but we survived it. I don’t care if you don’t love her or if you don’t like her, but you have to be decent to her, if for no other reason then I want you to. You owe me that.”Her cheeks were red, and while it was probably just a cold I couldn’t help but worry about her heart. I said nothing.“ for the record, I’m sick of misery,“ she said then she turned and went back inside, leaving me to stand in the swirl of leaves and think about what I owed her. By any calculation, it was everything. And so I made the decision to change. It might seem like change was impossible, given my nature in my age, but I understood exactly what there was to lose. It was chemistry all over again. The point wasn’t whether or not I liked it. The point was it had to be done.I had never known that Maeve thought about the girls again, but it made sense. Our childhood was a fire. There had been four children in the house and only two of them had gotten out.“Where were the Van Hoebeeks going?“Maeve opened one eye and smiled at me. “I love you,“ she said. “That’s exactly what I asked.”Things changed again after that, change being the one constant.One night, after a couple glasses of wine, she suggested that maybe she could be my sister. “Not Maeve,“ she said, “never Maeve, but some other, lesser sister, like a half-sister from a second marriage.”“ I thought you were my half-sister for my second marriage.”She shook her head. “I’m your stepsister.”"

1870,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/78854108-gil,Rating 3 out of 5,"2.5 starsAside from having all the elements I usually love in contemporary fiction (family saga, fairytale vibe, historical setting), The Dutch House was also my most anticipated read from the Women's Prize longlist, so I'm doubly disappointed at how little I turned out to like it.And it's not for lack of trying, either. I remember finishing Part 2 of the book (there are three parts) and thinking, ""The characters are still flat and I'm still not sure what the plot is, but maybe it'll get better...?"" Sadly, it didn't. After finishing the book, I even put off writing a review in hopes that it would ""age"" better in my mind, but to no avail—The Dutch House remained firmly mediocre.It didn't start out that way, though. At the beginning I could still see how it might turn out to be a 4-star read. The world of the novel was easy to plunge into, especially since the shape of the story is familiar. We have a set-up straight out of a fairytale: a beautiful and mysterious house, an absent-minded father, an evil stepmother, and a brother and sister à la Hansel and Gretel. The plot revolves mainly around the relationship between the siblings—Danny, the narrator, and Maeve, his elder sister by seven years—as they struggle to survive with only each other as family.I usually enjoy fairytale spin-offs, so I had no problem with these tropes. What I did have a problem with was that they remained little more than that. As the story progressed, the characters behave exactly as you'd expect them to—especially Andrea, the beautiful and evil stepmother, who behaves so stereotypically that she might as well join the ranks of Disney stepmothers. Plus, the main characters were so passive that they weren't so different from who they were as children. We're talking about some forty years here, and had it not been for the change of external circumstances, I wouldn't have been able to tell 15-year-old Maeve and 50-year-old Maeve apart. I think the flatness of the characters can be traced back to the lack of plot, which can be summarized in two points: 1) Maeve and Danny are thrown out of the Dutch house. 2) They pine for the Dutch house over the next thirty-something years. Clearly the heart of the story, despite all the changes that occurred in their lives, remains their abruptly-ended childhood at the Dutch house; but the emotional resonance of this was all wrung out by the first third of the novel. The next two-thirds have the feel of a group of long-time friends recycling the same stories and anecdotes to each other ad nauseam. To reiterate what Celeste, Danny's wife, tells him: “Jesus. It’s like you’re Hansel and Gretel. You just keep walking through the dark woods holding hands no matter how old you get. Do you ever get tired of reminiscing?”Aside from the characters and the plot, I also had a problem with the portrayal of women here. It was grating to see how they all seemed to exist solely to care for other people (i.e., Danny). Even Maeve, whom Danny respects and adores, is depicted as brilliant but with no ambition of her own: she consistently downplays her talents, works at a job far beneath her where she feels ""indispensable"" to the male owner, and does the books for Danny's real estate business. Danny himself describes his wife Celeste as having ""committed herself to smoothening my path and supporting my life"". The other significant characters are the cook, housekeeper, and nanny of the Dutch house, who consistently swoop in like fairy godmothers when the siblings are in need. Their doubly disadvantaged position (women, working class) was never problematised.In an interview with Time magazine, Patchett seems to address this point by saying that she had little difficulty writing Danny's point of view because she's known ""many men who are smart and charming and funny and interesting, who have no understanding of the fact that their whole life is built on the shoulders of the women who carry them around"". However, in my opinion, choosing Danny as the narrator was the least effective way to get this point across. The novel might have been more insightful had it been told from Maeve's perspective.The most exasperating part was the depiction of motherhood in the story. Patchett presents the readers with two exemplars of motherhood: Andrea, the evil stepmother, and Elna, Maeve and Danny's birth mother. Clearly Andrea is the 'bad' mother, but Patchett tries to forward a ""nuanced"" view of motherhood with Elna. It's true that Elna abandons her children early on in the novel, but she does it for a Noble Cause: to help the poor in India.Oh, please. Spare me. This seems to imply that the only way a woman can be considered 'good' despite abandoning her children is through 1) caring for other people, especially the disadvantaged; 2) living a life of poverty; and 3) having a history as a nun, because apparently it cannot be emphasized enough how 'saintly' she is. As if women need more impossible standards to live up to. I was more moved by Woodson's commentary on motherhood in Red at the Bone, which deals with the similar theme of the absent mother, but with far more nuance and insight.Overall, I was underwhelmed by The Dutch House. Its characters were flat and passive, the plot was virtually nonexistent, and its portrayal of women was problematic. But I'm clearly in the minority here. A lot of other readers loved this, so I'd still recommend this to fans of family sagas and historical fiction. This is my first read from Patchett, so while I won't be foregoing her works completely, I'm inclined to approach her books with more caution. 2.5 out of 5 stars.

1871,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47158996-marek-z-kop-an,Rating 4 out of 5,"Vydavateľstvo Tatran pokračuje v úspešnej tradícii vydávania kníh svetového formátu a prináša slovenským čitateľom román nominovaný na prestížnu Pulitzerovu cenu. Ann Patchettová síce v našich končinách nepatrí medzi známe mená, no má na svojom konte množstvo zaujímavých kníh, svietiacich na priečkach bestsellerov. Holandský dom predstavuje peripetie súrodencov Dannyho a Maeve, tiahnuce sa piatimi desaťročiami. Pritom rozsahovo nie je vôbec veľký, autorka dáva prednosť kvalite pred kvantitou, čo sa odráža aj v jej štýle. Je veľmi nevšedný, okamžite ma ním vtiahla do svojho sveta, kde sa prelína krutá realita s rozprávkovosťou. Občas mi pripomenula velikánov magického realizmu, inokedy zas úvahy existencialistov. Križovatky života a času sú totiž neoddeliteľnou súčasťou tohto originálneho príbehu.""Keď sa Andrea s dievčatami presťahovali do Holandského domu a Maeve sa vrátila do školy, s otcom sme sa zblížili. Odjakživa sa o mňa starala sestra, no keď odišla, otec sa začal nečakane zaujímať o moje domáce úlohy a basketbalové zápasy. Nikomu ani nenapadlo, že by úlohu, ktorú v mojom živote zohrávala Maeve, mohla zastávať Andrea. Otázka v skutočnosti znela, do akej miery môžem ako jedenásťročný žiť bez dozoru dospelých."" (str. 42)Dvadsať kapitol vás prevedie osudmi Conroyovcov, ktorí sa po vojne nasťahujú do Holandského domu. Ten kedysi obývala rodina Van Hoebeekovcov, po ktorých získal meno a museli ho opustiť pre zlú finančnú situáciu. Nádej, že novým majiteľom prinesie viac šťastia, netrvá dlho. Po odchode matky sa deti musia zmieriť s novou macochou a jej dvoma potomkami, ktorí sa nielenže veľmi rýchlu udomácnia v novom prostredí, ale prevezmú nad ním aj kontrolu. Andrea sa čoskoro stáva hlavou rodiny a nevlastné deti sú jej na príťaž. Ich ďalšie kroky preto smerujú mimo domu, nesúc si so sebou detské traumy a nepochopenie najbližšieho okolia. Staršia Maeve a mladší Danny netušia, že ich niekdajší domov bude s nimi prepojený aj naďalej. Klišé ohľadom nevyspytateľných ciest osudu sa v tomto prípade napĺňa do posledného písmena a na čitateľa čaká rozmanitý zážitok pri spoznávaní ich cieľa. Ann Patchettová zvolila zaujímavú kompozíciu rozprávania. Názov naznačuje, že dušou príbehu je samotný dom, rozprávačom je Danny, no na obálke sa vyníma mladé dievča, s najväčšou pravdepodobnosťou Maeve. Apropo, obálka. Som rád, že vydavateľstvo ponechalo pôvodnú grafiku, pretože ide o skutočne peknú kúsok. Dievčina akoby priamo odkazovala na maľby holandských majstrov, okrem toho jeden konkrétny obraz je aj súčasťou deja, keďže na dianie obyvateľov domu sa pozerajú portréty Van Hoebeekovcov. Pre Dannyho je Maeve strážnym anjelom a po čase si uvedomíte, kto je skutočným protagonistom knihy. Optika priameho rozprávača je skôr prostriedkom než sondou do vnútra postavy, no svoju funkciu plní viac než dostatočne. Keď��e príbeh zahŕňa niekoľko desaťročí, čaká vás tiež striedanie časových rovín. Aj tu sa prejavila autorkina znalosť človeka, pretože spomienky sú zvláštnym fenoménom a udalosti sa nemuseli odohrať vždy tak, ako si ich pamätáme. Nespoľahlivosť pamäti je prvkom, s ktorým by mal čitateľ počítať. A ak na to nebude dbať, o to väčšie bude napokon jeho prekvapenie a prehodnotenie prečítaného. ""Krivdy, ktorými sa jedna proti druhej previnili Maeve a Celeste, boli po všetkých tých rokoch bezpredmetné. Nemali sa rady už zo zvyku. Nemohol som si pomôcť, no bol som presvedčený, že keby sa stretli len ony dve nezávisle odo mňa, výborne by si rozumeli. Na začiatku to skutočne tak bolo. Obe boli múdre, vtipné a nekonečne oddané. Tvrdili, že ma ľúbia viac než ktokoľvek iný, nikdy si však nepripustili, ako veľmi ma ničí, keď sa navzájom kritizujú. Vinil som z toho obe. Mohli s tým konečne prestať. Mohli sa rozhodnúť, že zakopú vojnovú sekeru. Ale neurobili to a ďalej si pestovali svoju zatrpknutosť."" (str. 184)Holandský dom je román o rodinných vzťahoch, odpustení a pohnútkach, ktoré dokážu človeka priviesť až na hranice možností. Po dynamickom úvode síce trochu zvoľní tempo, ale ide iba o povestné ticho pred búrkou, pretože udalosti opäť rýchlo naberú spád, reprezentovaný prienikom do mysle a pocitov postáv. Odhaľovanie tajomstiev a zmena uhlov pohľadu na rôzne situácie sa dejú prirodzene, akoby išlo o skutočnosť a nie fantáziu Ann Patchettovej. A to je nepochybne ďalší pozitívny prvok tohto rozjímavého, dojemného románu."
1872,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10571401-mikko-saari,Rating 4 out of 5,"Amerikkalainen Ann Patchett on pitkän linjan kirjailija, jonka esikoisromaani The Patron Saint of Liars ilmestyi jo 1992. Patchettin aikaisempaa tuotantoa ei ole suomennettu; tämä uusin romaani vuodelta 2019 on ensimmäinen suomennos. Minun luettavakseni se osui vähän sattumalta. Kustantamon kuvastosta se oli mennyt ohi, mutta törmäsin kirjaan sattumalta kirjakaupassa, kun etsin joululahjaa vaimolleni. Kirjaa kehuttiin hyväksi juonivetoiseksi romaaniksi, mikä kuulosti lahjansaajan mieltymykset tuntien lupaavalta.Tuntematon kirjailija osoittautui nappivalinnaksi. Vaimoni luki ja piti lukemastaan, joten minäkin tartuin kirjaan, ja onhan tämä tosiaan hieno teos. Hollantilainen talo kertoo Philadelphian lähistöllä olevasta kartanosta, jonka hollantilaiset VanHoebeekit rakensivat 1920-luvulla. VanHoebeekit kuolivat ja talo jäi autioksi, kunnes sen osti vuonna 1946 vaimolleen lahjaksi Cyril Conroy, amerikkalaisen self made man -unelman toteuttanut kiinteistömoguli.Kirjan pääosassa ovat Conroyn lapset, Maeve ja Danny. Pikkuveli Danny toimii kirjan kertojana, jonka näkökulmasta perheen vaiheita tarkastellaan vuosikymmenten ajan. Kun Danny on kolmevuotias ja Maeve kymmenen, perheen äiti Elna sairastuu ja lopulta jättää perheen ja lähtee Intiaan auttamaan köyhiä. Cyril ottaa eron ja menee uusiin naimisiin. Pian Andrea, joka kenties rakastaa taloa enemmän kuin Cyriliä, muuttaa taloon kahden tyttärensä kanssa.Varsinkin Maeven ja Andrean välit viilenevät nopeasti, ja lasten ja pahan äitipuolen lopullinen välirikko tulee, kun Andrea pistää Maeven ja Dannyn pihalle kodistaan lasten isän kuoleman jälkeen. Alkaa vuosikymmeniä kestävä vihan ja katkeruuden kierre, jossa Maevella ja Dannylla on vain toisensa, kun isä on kuollut, äiti on kadoksissa ja koti on menetetty. Kirja tarkastelee Dannyn ja Maeven elämää pitkään, vuosikymmenten ajan. Kirjan rakenne on melko suoraviivainen, ryyditettynä takaumilla ja leikkauksilla aikakausien poikki. Tarina soljuu sujuvasti eteenpäin, keskiössään Danny, jolle monet talon käänteistä ovat jääneet aikoinaan vieraiksi. Danny on ollut kuitenkin pieni lapsi, eikä asioista ole muutenkaan puhuttu. Keskustelujen kautta vanhat tapahtumat kuitenkin avautuvat. Kun näkökulma on Dannyn, vaikkapa Andrean näkemys asioista jää täysin pimentoon: hän näyttäytyy vain pahana äitipuolena, eikä hänen motivaatioistaan ole kuin Dannyn, Maeven ja näiden lähipiirin arvailuja.Hollantilainen talo on hieno kertomus. Se on todellakin erinomaisesti kirjoitettu, eikä Laura Jänisniemen suomennoksestakaan ole valittamista. Tarinassa on monia herkullisia käänteitä, kuinka tietyt kaavat toistuvat sukupolvesta toiseen, vain hieman eri muodoissa. Vaikkapa isä Cyrilin ja Dannyn välinen suhde – kuinka Cyril toisti samoja virheitä uudestaan ja uudestaan, ja miten Danny on hyvin monella tapaa samanlainen ja toisaalta erilainen kuin isänsä. Myös Maeven osa elämässä, jota rajaavat toisaalta sukupuoli ja siihen liittyvät odotukset, toisaalta isän suhtautuminen tyttäreensä, on kiinnostava, samoin Dannyn ja Maeven välinen vastuullisen isosiskon ja huolettomamman ja asioista enemmän pihalla olevan pikkuveljen suhde. Hollantilainen talo on monikerroksinen kertomus, josta riittää ammennettavaa ja pohdiskeltavaa. Laajassa henkilögalleriassa on monenlaisia kohtaloita ja käänteitä. Oliko lasten äiti kammottava roisto vai muiden hyvää ajatteleva pyhimys? Oliko Andrea vain paha äitipuoli vai vain omaa etuaan ajava nainen? Miksi Cyril oli niin huomaavainen toisissa asioissa, mutta aivan sokea toisissa? Mikä kiinnostava sukusaaga tämä onkaan! Kun Hollantilainen talo on näinkin hieno kirja, on mukavaa, että se on nyt saatu suomeksi. Toivottavasti Hollantilaista taloa seuraa lisää Patchett-suomennoksia myös aikaisemmista kirjoista."
1873,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31515790-soumya-prasad-bluntpages,Rating 4 out of 5,"For a brief while on Social Media, this is the only book I saw and heard about. Everyone was praising this book and it even made to the shortlist of the best books of 2019 on Goodreads under the Historical Fiction genre. I was obviously intrigued, but wary too. I usually don't like over-hyped books and I prefer to make my own decision about it. Then, Nabanita included this book in her top 15 reads of the year and I was sold. Along with Shalini, she is another blogger whose reviews I would trust blindly. I have a penchant for historical fiction and I just had to cave in. I bought this book in November last year, but did not read it immediately. This was the first book that I read in 2020.As the title suggests, the story is all about the Dutch House and the people who live/lived in it. It is called the Dutch House by locals because of the provenance of its original owners, the Van-Hoebeeks, rather than its architectural style. It appears to float several inches above the hill it sits on and has huge glass windows, so much that you can see through the house. The house is indeed a piece of art with delft mantels, marble flooring, a ballroom and a gilt ceiling. The house is decorated with silk chairs, Chinese lamps, tapestry ottomans and huge oil paintings of the original owners, the Van-Hoebeeks. The Van-Hoebeeks were wealthy people who made a fortune in the tobacco industry. Later when they went bankrupt, the house was bought by Cyril Conroy, a self-made real estate mogul for his family that comprises of his wife Elna, daughter Maeve, son Danny and three helps, Fluffy, Sandy and Jocelyn.Elna dislikes the house and finds it too big for their basic comforts. Soon, she leaves the house and her family and is presumed dead. Maeve and Danny are raised by their father with ample assistance from the helps. When Cyril brings home a window, Andrea, Maeve and Danny are taken by surprise and dislike her almost immediately. Andrea and her two young daughters become a constant presence in the house and Cyril ends up marrying Andrea soon after. Maeve and Danny are not too fond of their step-mother, but take a liking to their step-sisters, Norma and Bright. When Cyril dies of a heart-attack, Maeve and Danny rely on each other for comfort and support. Like all evil step-mothers, Andrea soon throws them out of the house and refuses to part with her late husband's fortune. The only thing that she agrees to provide for them is a trust fund, just for their education.Thus, Maeve and Danny leave the Dutch house. Maeve is already working and has a small apartment, so Danny moves in with her. Danny takes up medicine, thanks to the coaxing of Maeve to fully utilize the educational trust fund. His real interest is in real-estate, just like his dad. Will he be able to achieve his dreams? Will Maeve and Danny continue to be close as they grow up? What happens to their individual lives? Most importantly, will they set foot in the Dutch house again?I thought that this book had some element of mystery or thrill in it, before I started reading it. But, it just turned out to be the story of a house. And honestly, that is exactly what works for this book. There is nothing great about the story and it most definitely is not unheard of, but it still makes you stay glued to it. I was so vested in the intricate and beautiful relationship between the siblings Maeve and Danny. Decades pass and they stand by each other like rocks. The writing is beautiful and easy to read. The story flows seamlessly from page to page from the past to the present. With just a handful of characters, each character adds something to the story and does complete justice to it. You can imagine all of them in your head, like a big happy family. But, it is the siblings who steal the show. Narrated by Danny and spanning across five decades, the story talks about their lives and their obsession with the Dutch house. So much that even after being exiled from the house, they visit as often as they can and watch it from a distance. Yes, it is like stalking, but of a house. That's the emotion they hold towards it. That's the same emotion the reader feels.I say it again. There is nothing great about this book. This is the story of the house and the people who live/lived in it. This is exactly what is so good about the story and the characters. The emotions are raw, believable and honest. As is the writing. I'd give this book a five stars, but I found quite some spelling issues in the book and misplaced words. They put me off lightly. I'll not flaw the story otherwise.Verdict: A very clichéd concept, but a story like none other. Read it now.Rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars."
1874,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53251866-maria,Rating 4 out of 5,"3,5/5I den fartfyllda värld vi lever i idag, behöver vi ibland något som inte alls är lika dramatiskt och fullt av action för att helt enkelt få komma ner i lite mer balans. Så även i böckernas värld. Det är så många som bara går i ett och en sak byter av nästa nästan innan den tidigare har hunnit avslutas.Det holländska huset är lite åt andra hållet. Under fem decennier möter vi Danny och hans storasyster Maeve Conroy. Deras far Cyril köpte huset som en överraskningspresent till deras mor Elna. Men det hela slår fel, modern hatar huset och lämnar familjen medan barnen fortfarande är små. Pappan gifter om sig med Andrea, som inte bryr sig om barnen, och när Cyril dör av en hjärtattack, står allt skrivet på Andrea och syskonen förlorar allt, utom möjligheten till att få sin utbildning betald. Maeve bestämmer att Danny ska läsa till läkare, för att mjölka så mycket pengar ur det som möjligt. För han vill inte alls bli läkare, han vill gå i sin fars fotspår och hyra ut fastigheter.Genom Dannys ögon blandas berättelser från uppväxten med sådana från vuxenvärlden och det är tydligt att det är en tillbakablick på ett liv som kanske inte blev som han tänkte sig, men som i slutändan ändå är okej.Persongalleriet är lagom stort. Främst är det Danny och Maeve som är i fokus, och ibland den familj Danny får som vuxen. Men eftersom de allra flesta personerna är med ända från bokens början blir det aldrig särskilt svårt att veta vem som är vem. Jag gillar att Maeve får vara bestämd och självsäker medan Danny är lite mer av en people pleaser, för det känns ganska tvärtemot hur det sett ut de senaste femtio åren. Jag gillar också att det är ur Dannys perspektiv berättelsen kommer, för det är ändå han som på något sätt samtidigt beter sig på det sätt han tror att alla vill att han gör, men ändå gör det han själv vill i smyg medan han gör det och sedan har hamnat i ett äktenskap han egentligen kanske inte ville ingå med en kvinna som mest ville gifta sig med honom för att vara läkarhustru. Egentligen är han ganska svår att tycka om, för han är väldigt självisk och egenkär, tänker sällan på andra (än sin syster) och har svårt att släppa taget om det som hänt för att leva i nuet. Men det gör det också mycket mer intressant att läsa den här boken, som jag tror hade tappat mycket av sin indragande karaktär på att ha en annan sorts berättare. Den behövs för att det ändå ska kännas som att händelserna går framåt.Det holländska huset har en central roll i berättelsen, trots att de inte bor där i vuxen ålder. Men Maeve och Danny brukar åka och parkera bilen utanför och bara sitta och titta och prata om saker de minns.Det tar ett tag för mig att komma in i läsningen, och eftersom det här är en bok helt olik mot dem jag brukar läsa, tror jag inte riktigt att jag lyckas att ta den till mig på det sätt som författaren menar att jag ska göra. Jag tycker om slutet av boken, mest för att det är där det känns som att det börjar komma igång på riktigt. Däremot är jag förtjust i språket och det får mig att direkt känna mig mindre stressad. Kanske är det därför som den här boken tar okaraktäristiskt lång tid för mig att läsa."

Nunca lo hubiera elegido por mi misma, y no me hubiera equivocado. No es de mi estilo. No he podido encontrarle nada que merezca la pena. Me ha parecido un libros con potencial pero que se quedaba a medias, como un proyecto.**Alerta spoiler!!1.-La historia. Se nos cuenta la vida de dos hermanos que viven en la casa Holandesa, que pasan de tenerlo todo a no tener nada. Puede que la sinopsis hable de la historia de tres generaciones, pero no es así (tampoco recuerdo si lo pone o no). Y todo lo que nos cuenta, lo hace como si pasara de puntillas, sin resaltar o ahondar demasiado en algo. Me resultó todo demasiado pobre, demasiado soso y demasiado vago.2.-Los personajes. Danny, el narrador, no tiene ni sangre ni horchata. Se nos muestra como una persona que no es capaz de demostrar sus emociones, igual que su padre. Pero es que los demás tampoco se puede decir precisamente que estén más desarrollados. Les falta carisma a todos. La más interesante es Maeve (hubiera sido una protagonista estupenda), pero al igual que los demás, tampoco llegamos a conocerla a fondo, nos falta demasiada información. Por no conocer, no llegamos a conocer a nadie, por eso simpatizar con ellos puede resultar difícil.No se ahonda a fondo en su verdadera naturaleza, se pasa por ellos como de puntillas, como si la autora tuviera miedo de despertarlos.3.-La pluma, la narrativa, la trama y demás. Trama, que trama? No pasa absolutamente nada. No hay giros que sorprendan, no hay tensión, no hay nada. Quizá pasa un poco en el capitulo 18, pero muy poco. Los capítulos son muy largos, aunque hay uno que dura un cuarto de página. Presentan saltos en el tiempo que lo único que aportan es confusión y están narrados en primera personaje por un personaje que carece totalmente de espíritu.Es un historia muy leeeeeeeeenta y aburrida. Intenta despertar emociones pero en mi caso no lo consiguió. Ha sido mi lectura más tediosa de los últimos tiempos. Todavía no me explico como llegué a terminarlo y no lo abandone antes de la página 50. Bueno sí, si me lo explico, lo termine porque valía una insignia del club de lectura (¡Lo que llega a hacer una por una insignia!).4.-El final. Un final feliz? supongo que sí. Y supongo que es lo que le pega a la historia, pero tampoco es uno de esos que te deja huella. Seguro que dentro de una semana ya no recuerdo nada. Y me alegro, no merece la pena ni el tiempo.En fin, 1 estrella sobre 5 porque no es un libro para mí y porque ha sido una de las lecturas más soporíferas que recuerdo. Si buscas un libro enganche, este no es tu libro. Pero si buscas uno para dormir, puede que te resulte perfecto.**Popsugar 2020 categoría 35. Un libro con título de tres palabras."
1876,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21869758-s-c-karakaltsas,Rating 4 out of 5,"This character driven novel broodily unpacks the drama of a family over five decades.Right after WW2, Cyril Conroy buys a run-down mansion as surprise for his wife, Elna. With their daughter Maeve, they move into the house which is still filled with the previous family’s abandoned belongings. Elna is uncomfortable and unhappy with the ostentatiousness of her new surroundings and Cyril brings in servants to help in the mistaken belief that this will make his wife happy. Elna has a son Danny, ten years after Maeve and she continues to be restless disappearing for days when finally, when Danny is three, she inexplicably abandons her family and disappears for good.Danny is the unreliable narrator of this story. He tries to make sense of his past as well as his present. He remembers little of his mother and his father is remote. He relies on the servants and his older sister for his care. When his father marries Andrea, two more children are brought into the house. Life becomes more difficult for Danny and his sister when it’s clear that Andrea is a reluctant step-mother. When his father dies, Andrea throws fifteen-year-old Danny and her sister out to look after themselves.The thing about an unreliable narrator like Danny is that he is on the periphery of the family story. As an adult, he is almost clueless about the women of this family, including his wife, struggling to understand how they think and why. Yet his clingy possessiveness of his sister (mother substitute) affects him for life.Is your childhood home as central to who you are? In this case it’s pivotal. The Dutch House is a symbol for what was good and bad in the brother and sisters’ lives.I found it interesting that Danny wanted so much to be like his father. A father who became rich without his wife knowing, who bought her The Dutch House as a romantic and generous gesture not knowing his wife hated it.‘God’s truth,’ Maeve said. ‘Our father was a man who had never met his own wife.’Danny falls into the trap himself with his own wife and history repeats itself except that he eventually comes to realise it. His reliance on his sister was interesting and almost stifling. And although we learn a lot about Maeve through his eyes, there’s a lot we don’t know. We never know if Maeve had romantic interests or friends and I wonder if the closeness Danny had for her was not as close as it could have been.The same can be said of the step-mother painted as evil and money hungry who loved the house, yet she is as mysterious to brother and sister and reader alike.It’s a modern-day Cinderella story up to a point and the love between the siblings is intense and tender. I love Patchett’s writing style, easy to read, yet beautifully crafted. It’s a slow burn of a story, so take your time and enjoy it."
1877,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19834555-margarida,Rating 4 out of 5,"From the moment I began reading this book, I couldn't stop. Patchett's writing is so immersive it truly feels like you're there, with Danny and Maeve, the ghost of a sibling they never knew they had. Her prose is flawless and effortless, and despite being very descriptive, Ann makes it so appealing you don't notice it. She paints the scenario, places the objects and gives them life, in a very organic, cinematic way. She's purposeful and methodical but simultaneously, natural. Unlike what so many say, Andrea is not the most hateful character in this book. She's the evilest, for sure, but their father is the one I blame for all the unfortunate events that came to pass after his death. How can a man put his new wife ahead of his children without so much as a second thought? It's not like he didn't know what he was doing. He knew, and he let it all happen. Many were the moments when he should've risen his voice to their protection, and yet he remained silent and careless. Danny says 'He had protected me from the world so completely that I had no idea what the world was capable of.' This thought only goes to show the depth of the abuse both siblings went through. Maeve was cast out, Dan was locked in. And when they think they'll get their independence, the truth of what their father did ruins it again, in such a way that Maeve becomes obsessed about revenge and ruins her brother's future. 'The Dutch House' reminded me of a twisted, grown-up version of Cinderella, where the father is absent, the step-mother abusive, and the step-sisters are too young to take sides. However, instead of having a happy ending, this story reveals the complexity of the human character and how a dysfunctional household affects a person's behaviour. Danny and Maeve are wonderful, flawed people, that made de best with what they had and turned out quite alright. But simultaneously, you can see how they could've been. I must say, however, that this book is very polished. Heteronormative white characters, that go from being rich to having ""solely"" an education fund. This book screams privilege - white privilege, economic privilege, gender privilege. But at the same time, the author touches important subjects such as family relationships, psychological abuse, male privilege - all of these throughout the three family generations. It's not the most profound book, but it certainly makes you think. I must confess, however, that in terms of plot-twists, Patchett failed to surprise me. In the end, it seems like she's just trying to be dramatic like she wants to destroy you but doesn't really know how to do so. Lastly, I must warn you of the chaotic timeline chosen by the author. It follows no pattern and no rule, which makes it hard (at times) to comprehend. I didn't have much trouble with it – I think it gave the book a certain flair –, but I saw many people complaining about it."
1878,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7616365-n-l-brisson,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Dutch House by Ann Patchett is a study of a family, an American family. It is a story told by the second child, a boy named Danny. It’s a story about a clueless father and husband who buys his wife a house, a famous house, built with much attention to detail by a wealthy family, the VanHoebeeks,. The ceiling in the dining room is a work of art, literally. The house has a ballroom and a conservatory. Since the sale was an estate sale, all the VanHoebeek’s belongings are still in the house, including portraits of husband and wife over the mantle in the drawing room. Despite all the architectural glories the house has a very small kitchen because the staff would use it, not the family. There is also a pool.Into this ritzy house Cyril Conroy brings his wife. He bought the house for her as a surprise. At the time they had one child, their daughter Maeve. The house was a source of pride for the husband who was a real estate investor and property manager. But his wife, was appalled by the expensive details. She yearned to dedicate her life to helping the poor. Clive found Elna just as she was preparing to enter a convent, not yet a nun. He whisked her away and married her. We often see our partners in life through cloudy mirrors. We make assumptions that if they love us they must be like us. The Dutch House is a story about misplaced love and misunderstood love. Maeve shoulders all the responsibilities of these selfish parents when the family falls apart. Some people should never have children. She yearns for what they lost, the family and the house and the hired women who took care of them, Fluffy, Sandy, and Jocelyn. Maeve is obsessed and cannot move on with her own life. Although this is a story of a family, and of loss and reunion, even more it is a story of a house. If you have ever given a home and your heart to cats you know that some cats fall in love with people, but some cats fall in love with houses. How do Maeve and her brother lose the Dutch House and then get it back? Although nothing earthshaking happens, there are plenty of repercussions. What stories are more interesting than stories about families? Take your pick, but I will usually enjoy a good family saga by any writer as skilled as Ann Patchett. This book will probably be made into a movie, but doesn’t even have to be made into a movie because it already creates one in your mind."
1879,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1227040-akin,No Rating,"When I was a child, my older sister used to read to me at night, night after night, after our parents had sent us to bed. Well, ""read to me"" isn't quite correct. She would relate to me, chapter by chapter and beat by beat, the story of a book that she had just read – The Famous Five, Secret Seven, The Magic Faraway Tree, stuff like that. She was 9 or 10 at the time, I was 5 or 6. Her recall, I assume, was amazing (true, I had nothing really to compare against, bu the cohesion and logic of the stories always added up to a complete whole); the entertainment value – the emotional value – was without parallel.I don't think I ever remembered to say thank you to her. It's important, stuff like this, because I suspect that it was thanks to moments like this that I became a reader, and then a writer (of sorts); thanks to her, I discovered the value to words and imagination and storytelling, in a form that couldn't possibly be replicated or taught at any other point in my life.(cf Poetry: Every so often, I wish she'd gone beyond The Owl and the Pussycat and ""Augustus was a chubby lad.."" (Struwwelpeter). I might actually be quite an erudite somebody now...)Anyway, the point is, I never said thank you because, in that little self-anchored orbit that many of us inhabit, moments like this are completely natural, It is, and so it ought to be. We take the beauty of simple gestures for granted. Which is terribly sad.The Dutch House brought this understanding back to me vividly. The notion of selflessness, and how the recipient sometimes accepts it...not as their die, not quite, but as they way things have always worked and will always work. Never to be missed until they are gone and will never come back. I'm fortunate (I think, I hope, I hope I can remember) because just possibly I've had that reckoning (thanks to this book, I'm embarrassed to say) at a time when just may maybe I have the opportunity to say and to act the thank you that I owe my sister for helping me become a half-formed person (rather than the uncouth savage champing at the bit within).The Dutch House is about selflessness, albeit on a different level – a brother and sister abandoned to the world, and the emotional sacrifices that the sister makes to protect her brother. It is a good book, even if somewhat unsatisfactory towards the very end – I suspect that Ms Pratchett intended to paint a picture, rather than to tell a story, and she (I think) found herself trapped into tying together loose ends that might have been better left unfurled, I don't know.As ever, the star system is inadequate, and can't really represent the fullness and subtlety of my thinking about this book. Somewhat inchoate as it is (in my view), it is a wonderful character study, a thoughtful consideration of love and loss and permanence and abandonment. And how we, selfish recipients of unconditional love, all too often focus on what we have missed, rather than what we have gained.Recommended"
1880,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7618432-ninab,Rating 2 out of 5,"I give it 4* for the narration. There was something soothing about Tom Hanks’s voice telling a story while I disinfected my house during this Coronavirus pandemic. For the story I give it 2*. I picked up the Audiobook version because I’ve heard excellent reviews of Tom Hanks’ reading it. I tried to read Ann Patchett before, but gave up on the book after about halfway. The Dutch House kept my interest most of the way and I credit that to Tom Hanks’s engaging narration. The story itself is a little frustrating, the ending unfulfilling. *** Spoilers below ***Maeve and Danny’s characters are likable enough that I wanted to see how their story would end. They are victims of their selfish, neglectful parents. It’s easy to see why they ended up extremely close and loyal to each other growing up. I would’ve liked to see them grow up a much better version of their parents. Instead, they were selfish and neglectful also, sadly unattached to anyone except each other.The mean stepmother is cliched. The absent father is portrayed as being business and real estate savvy, yet allowed himself to be manipulated by his wife? I also found it unbelievable that the case was tight against his children (one was still a minor) to receive any financial support from his estate after his death. Another irritating part in the book is how the mother, who abandoned Maeve and Danny, is characterized as saintly. She returned toward the end and everyone, except for Danny, received her with open arms. Then we are told it was her kindness and love for the poor that made her leave her kids. And then, her kind heart again decides to take care of her kids’ mean stepmother, the one who cruelly left her orphaned kids to fend for themselves, suffering from Alzheimer’s. The mom viewed this as penance. From a Catholic point of view, I guess this makes sense. But, it is not kindness to abandon your kids, even for her “noble” reasons.If Maeve and Danny had grown up with meaningful relationships, with a determination to become better than their parents, I would’ve liked this book better. That would’ve made the story more compelling. That would’ve shown that the injustice done to the Conroy kids caused them to become better people. That would’ve offered hope that the cycle of selfish neglectfulness has been broken. As it is, the story is not hopeful, but felt oppressively heavy. And I wanted so much more for those Conroy kids, after all that they went through."
1881,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3521069-laura,Rating 3 out of 5,"2.5 starsOVERALL: A long boring family saga with a dramatic house as the backdrop and connecting factor for many characters. Great narrator of Tom Hanks, which is how I could finish the book.CW: hospitalization, depression, divorce, abandonmentAt 40%-ish: So far this book is interesting in that I am fine to continue reading/listening, and the narrator is Tom Hanks so that is great. It is also a literary fiction book, so there's ""sort of"" plot but it's a lot more about the characters. Interestingly, I feel like we are learning a lot more about Maeve and getting to know her and care about her more than our main character of Danny.I finished the Dutch house: It was just so MEH. It was long and the point was... just a family saga study? I feel like Danny was one of the least developed characters of the book for me personally, he was really (as he says at the end of the book) telling Maeve's story. It annoyed me how lackluster his personality was, and how he seemed to drift through his life, unconcerned and never expressing strong emotion. He was the least curious or imaginative character I may have ever read, even bordering on selfish and uncaring at times.The house just functioned to be the dramatic setting for all of the good and bad things that happened to our main characters. It heightened what happened there: for some people the house made their situation worse, and for others it was for the better. And while that was to some extent the common denominator for the characters in this book, far more interesting were the relationships that existed between the people, not the setting.In some ways, I could kind of identify with Danny and Maeve going back to the house and sort of haunting it, because that's something my family members and I sporadically did with my own childhood home. And I was driven multiple times past my father's childhood home. Ultimately this story was just this long time frame covered vaguely and was mostly a character / family study.I'm not sure exactly what to think about Danny's mother coming back, and how differently he and his sister responded to her return... There is something interesting there, but the book didn't explore her abandonment enough for that to be a strong enough theme, in my opinion, to carry the whole book.... Maeve was obviously more affected by her mother's leaving, while Danny believed he was ambivalent until her return. I think this whole book from Maeve's POV would have been better: stronger emotions, more tension from both an absent mother and taking care of this younger brother, being diabetic, being in a job that was perhaps too easy, maybe missing out on love [I got LGBT vibes from Maeve]..."
1882,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54564996-robyn,Rating 5 out of 5,"There are very few words that can relate the beauty of the story and the writing of Ann Patchett’s THE DUTCH HOUSE. Very few authors have the ability to create such insight and depth in a story about a house and how it ties a family to it, whether or not they like it or even want to be there. Danny and Maeve Conroy lived in the Dutch House outside of Philadelphia. Their father Cyril purchased it for their mother, Elna but she never liked the house and one day, left when the children were 3 and 10, to help the poor in India and did not return. Later their father remarried Andrea with her two little girls, and four years later he is dead of a heart attack. Danny noted at that time that those left ""had all become characters in the worst part of a fairy tale"". The story is told by Danny, from childhood to adulthood, but the story he tells is really what and how he remembers Maeve, his beloved sister who was seven years older and stood in as a mother as he grew up and whom he loved dearly. Both children are educated, Meave having finished college before her father’s death, and Danny, only 15 at the time grows up and goes on to Medical School. But their inheritance is snatched away from both legally by Andrea, who retains all of Cyril’s fortune but an educational fund, and so… Medical school for Danny and years of sitting in a car on the street in front of the lost house that represented all that the siblings had lost, until … I was drawn in and totally engaged by the story so much so that I did not realize that Tom Hanks was reading it until I thought.. that sounds a great deal like Tom Hanks. And so it was. This made the story so much better… it is a great audio read. The story has reticent tones, sprinkled with humor, naiveté, and obsession and moves with age toward compassion, forgiveness, and some regret. The story spans over fifty years with so much grace, so much life and tenderness and longing for the family lost (mother, father, and stepsisters) that Maeve and Danny put together a family of sorts out of what is available, housekeeper, and cook before Danny marries. Patchett is a master at character development and all of the characters were delightful, even in their misguided ways they remained worthy of some compassion and understanding. I understood the anger at the loss of the house, but it was how it was lost that became the glue that held the story together. An amazing read.. 5 stars Happy Reading!The Dutch House"
1883,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2095931-jacki-julia-flyte,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Dutch House is a grand mansion in Philadelphia, originally built for a Dutch family. It's the house that Maeve and Danny (who narrates the book) grow up in. Their mother left when Danny was too young to remember her and the siblings share an intense bond. It's the kind of house that people fall in love with: their father did, their stepmother does. The ""Dutch House"" (as they always call it) leaves a lasting imprint on them for the rest of their lives. But while the house provides the central focus for the story, it's essentially about Maeve and Danny and the way their childhood and the loss of their mother influences the rest of their lives.This is a wonderful book, a book that you lose yourself in. Maeve and Danny are terrific characters. I loved them, I was invested in them. I was in awe of the way that Patchett advances the plot steadily whilst always weaving backwards and forwards in time. You barely notice she's doing it and even when you do, it's like expert stitching, you can't quite see where it happened. Oh and can I give a shout out to the gorgeous cover too? It's a painting of Maeve which also features in the story. Everything about this book feels considered and perfect.The book is divided into three parts. The first part is about Danny's childhood in the Dutch House. The middle section is about its ongoing influence on him and Maeve and the third section brings things full circle. Nevertheless it doesn't FEEL like a structured book. At the halfway mark I kept waiting for something to happen, thinking it was going to turn into a particular kind of story with a familiar arc. It doesn't. It's only when you finish it that you realise what Patchett was doing and you appreciate her mastery.At one point Danny's wife refers to Danny and Maeve as being like Hansel and Gretel - ""you just keep walking through the dark woods holding hands no matter how old you get"". There are many fairytale elements to this story: the absent mother, the evil stepmother, the house that's like a palace. And yes, there's a happy ending of sorts, but it's one that reflects real life rather than fairytales.Thank you very much to Bloomsbury who gave me an advance copy for review via Net Galley."
1884,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56104661-mark,Rating 5 out of 5,"The first-person narrator of The Dutch House, Danny Conroy, would have you believe he is telling the story of his competent, confident sister Maeve, who goes through life with one self-assured step after another without a single nervous backward glance. Stepping back from that idea, readers realize that Danny is, in fact, recounting the moving story of a special, lifelong brother-sister relationship. Beyond being thrown together by circumstance, Danny and Maeve are naturally drawn to one another by everything that is good and true between siblings.But this is Ann Patchett, an author renowned for crafting beautifully layered stories that embrace readers from the opening pages and take them by the hand deeper and deeper into the lives of her characters. Thus, stepping back further, Ann Patchett gives us a story of three generations of a family that is frequently splintered and then reintegrated in different ways. There are many children present, and we see them at different points in their lives from early childhood, to young adults, to mature individuals. Necessarily then, this is a fast-paced story of organic family pains that create conflict and harmony, love and loss, recrimination and forgiveness, and abandonment of responsibilities and finding of purpose.At the center of all the action is a house, the Dutch house of the book’s title, so called because of the builders and now-deceased owners of the house, the VanHoebeek family. When Cyril Conroy, the father of Maeve and Danny, purchases The Dutch House, it is a symbol of the crowning achievement of his rags-to-riches story through shrewd and savvy real estate investments. And though this not a gothic novel, there is a hint of something sinister about the way the house alienates some people and magnetically draws others back time and again. Even Danny and Maeve, after being banished from the house, routinely park outside its gates on the way to somewhere, simply to kill time, smoking and talking about events in their lives, and the lives of others they touched.Ms. Patchett’s literary skills are such that she infuses several mysteries into the novel, but doesn’t reveal answers all at once. Indeed, mysteries are often resolved for readers at the same time as they are for various characters in the story. There is a generous amount of nostalgia strewn throughout the story which affords many of the characters a chance to look—or at least to try and look—at events through a lens from days gone by rather than from the present time.Other reviewers have suggested that the elements and structure of The Dutch House make it something of a fairy story. I disagree. Ms. Patchett has written a very human, credible story with thoroughly authentic characters, and assembled everything in a way guaranteed to keep readers engrossed from lively beginning to satisfying end."
1885,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5277434-madeline,Rating 4 out of 5,"I have never read any Ann Patchett before, so I didn't quite know what to expect when going into this. But I think that really helped me enjoy this slow burn of a story.We follow two siblings, Danny and Maeve, as they navigate their lives, from youth surrounded by their controlling step-mother, until adulthood, as they struggle to put the pieces of their past back together. What Patchett gives us is a beautifully rendered character study, where we get to know Danny quite deeply, as he tells the saga of himself, and his sister. The events of their life seem to flow around them, as secondary elements that spur their development and growth. But even so, these events leave large impacts, and all center around one thing—the Dutch House, and the complicated memories left behind.I do wish we had gotten to know Maeve's perspective, though I think having two points-of-view would have ruined some of the mystery surrounding this story, which I think is quite necessary. I wonder what this book would have been like had it been written entirely from Maeve's perspective. Definitely more would have been known to us, spoiling the naïvety of Danny's telling, but I would have loved to get to know Maeve's thoughts more deeply, since she shares them so rarely to others. Even so, she is such a strong, deep character, and it was beautiful to read about her from her brother's admiring perspective. Their relationship is truly beautiful—they rely so much on each other, and know each other so deeply, that while they have their disagreements, it is clear that they both know they would be accepted by the other despite all of that. I do not have any siblings, so I have no way to relate to their intricate bond, but I loved reading about it, and admired the detail and care with which Patchett wrote. This story is clearly one full of love and loyalty—for people, for memories, and for the a physical space and all that it embodies. Danny and Maeve's journey is heartbreaking, surprising, complicated and bumpy, but it was a joy to read about. While this isn't a book you'll necessarily speed through, you'll find yourself quickly getting sucked into the story, which is all you can ask for from a book. I am eager to read more Patchett and return to her lovely writing, characters and worlds. "
1886,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/114901951-yasmin-luthra,Rating 4 out of 5,"Patchett's prose in The Dutch House is nothing short of stunning. There were several moments when I had to pause, finger on the page, to marvel at a metaphor—and sometimes I literally scrambled for a pencil in order to underline a passage, not ever wanting to forget it. Some such lines include ""Fluffy told Celeste the stories of the Dutch House like Scheherazade trying to win another night"" and ""Fluffy, who had not stopped talking since I walked in the door, shut down like a mechanical horse in need of another nickel."" So good! At the same time, the writing doesn't come across as self-aware, as if Patchett is trying  to write beautifully. It just is beautiful. As for the plot: like some reviews have noted, the story carried a lot of momentum for the first three quarters or so, but, as I neared the end, I started to think ""wait—that's it?"" Having had some time now to just reflect on the story, I appreciate it much more: I don't think Patchett meant for there to be a major, climactic ""a-ha!"" moment at any point in the story. Rather, it's a story about life and family and relationships, in all its messiness and mundaneness. Plenty has been written about the importance of place in the novel (after all, it's called The Dutch House), but my main impression of the book is that it is a work that explores what it means to be a good person (a saint, even). Is Edna Conroy, who  left Maeve and Danny because she just couldn't bear to be in the wealth-laden Dutch house while there were people to serve, a saint because she left her children to serve others? Is her saintliness impossible for normal people to understand, as Sandy speculates? Or is she selfish for trying to get the admiration of strangers, at the cost of caring for her own family, as Danny concludes? (Personally, I find it impossible to understand how she could leave her children, but then again I suppose I am not a ""saint"").  Perhaps Maeve is a better person because she dedicates her life to Danny—though perhaps she could also be criticized for pushing Danny to become a doctor simply to drain a trust fund and get back at their cruel stepmother. Danny tries to be good in his own way by  trying not to get in the way of Maeve's happiness upon being reunited with their mother, even though we learn he is unsuccessful at hiding his true feelings . Cyril tries to be a good husband to Edna by surprising her with the Dutch House, only to push her over the edge. Indeed, it seems like most of the characters in The Dutch House are trying to be good to one another, but do so without truly considering what would be good from the perspective of those closest to them. Perhaps the book is about the tension between loving others and not knowing how. Perhaps it's about opening your eyes to the people and world around you. Perhaps it's about trying your best.I don't yet know what to make of all this, but what I do know is that The Dutch House made me think about all this."
1887,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2871169-anita-notherbook,Rating 3 out of 5,"This book is about family dysfunction, maternal estrangement, a close sibling relationship, and a house. I felt it started off rather slow but then kept picking up and by midway it was really good. By the end it was fantastic. It also fit in a lot of time in one book and I get that books and movies have to do that to cover everything but I sometimes get whiplash or get confused about the timeline and dates. I THINK most of it takes place in the 60s but I'm not even sure. I found it a little hard to follow at first but that's probably because I get easily distracted and don't have enough time to pay close attention.But otherwise it was a great read about a brother and a sister growing up in a huge house with only their dad because their mom left. The story is told by Danny, the brother, but focuses in large part on Maeve, his sister. They have a trauma-bond type of relationship that is very close but doesn't allow for a lot of independence. Maeve takes care of Danny growing up while they experience even more tragedy, and in return, she expects him to live out her dreams of revenge and success. She herself is often ill with diabetes and so he is constantly worried about her health. And she maintains a mediocre job below her potential while wanting him to be a doctor. She also doesn't have any kind of love live or even friendships outside of her relationship with him. He does try to have a marriage but it's not very fulfilling because he is haunted by the demons from his past and he's rather emotionally incestuous with his sister. I felt really bad for Danny and as I write this review, I kind of hate Maeve. While reading it, though, I went back and forth about her. She was the mother figure in Danny's life but wanted him to live it for her and never let him grow on his own. I also hated the mom of course and I think I was supposed to feel understanding or even admire her in some kind of feminist theme but I didn't. Danny liked his dad but I didn't because he was emotionally unavailable and a workaholic. I guess I didn't like many of the characters in this book, including a lot of the housekeepers who were close with the kids but still somehow sympathetic or even admiring of the mom. Oh, and there's even an evil stepmother who I hated, of course. I did like Danny's daughter May. (He had a son but I kept forgetting that he existed.) I was ambivalent about Danny's wife Celeste but I did feel bad for her because Danny was never able to be a present or emotionally available husband. (Although luckily he did seem like a really good dad to May!) SLIGHT SPOILERS MAYBE, IDKI guess I would have given this book 5 stars except that I didn't understand why I was angrier at these characters than Danny was. I get that everyone wants an emotional uplifting read and as happy an ending as possible but I thought that literary fiction was more realistic. (I'm not sure if this is literary fiction or womens' fiction or kind of a mixed genre... I would definitely say more literary fiction though.) Maybe it's just where I'm at at this point in my life but I wanted Danny to live for himself for once in his sad life. To me, that would have been the happier ending but I know that everyone thinks love and forgiveness conquer all and that family unity equals a happy ending. I also try to tell myself that even though this book was told by Danny, it was really about the whole family and the house, and I should be rooting for all of them somehow, but I just can't separate my emotions from my logic I guess.And I don't want to make it sound like this book has a syrupy sweet ending or a fake happy family etc. Those are the worst and why I only read women's fiction or romcoms, etc., if I want a complete fantasy. The Dutch House is still a lot more realistic than that and shows the struggles of hardship so I mostly liked it but I think I just wanted more vindication for Danny. And even for Maeve. Although I found her selfish when it came to Danny, I understood her wanting her mother's love and like everyone she had some good traits. She had a lot of repressed anger that I think made her make her want to control Danny's emotions to match her own. There was one scene I particularly liked in which she finally expressed outrage. But I wanted more independence and vindication for her too. So maybe my only ""problem"" with this story was that it wasn't happy ENOUGH (in an individual character kind of way as opposed to the family-as-a-whole kind of way. The characters' quest to love others and chase their demons from the past kind of hampered their ability to discover themselves and live fully in the present. There was acceptance, which is good, but there wasn't a lot of letting go- it felt to me like the characters clung to their pain and the past and that's a sad ending to me even though things happened to help them confront the past and reunited old connections, etc.END SLIGHT SPOILERSThe house obviously plays a big role in this book and I ended up liking that it does. At first I was a bit bored because I don't care much about houses or architecture etc. The dad and then Danny are interested in buying and selling real estate and that part appealed more to me. But by the end the house plays a reoccurring role and you can see how it shaped their lives and was almost like a character itself.I listened to the audiobook version of this book and it was narrated by Tom Hanks, so that was nice. There was one part where a character was singing a little song and it was funny and I wished there was more singing for Tom Hanks to do. Haha.Overall I'm glad my friend Carey recommended this book to me and I would recommend it to anyone as a great read/listen. :) My issues with it are mostly based on my own preferences and life journey and I know that books aren't written just for me! I think the overall storyline is captivating and believable, the characters are mostly well-developed (I really didn't see the mom the way the other characters did though and found it hard to get a grasp on what was really up with her) and it kept me immersed. I think it would be perfect to have a movie made out of it and I could see a lot of it in my head already. And I'm glad Tom Hanks read it to me! Sometimes I'm amazed that I get all this entertainment for free, so, I would be remiss not to thank the Albuquerque/Bernalillo Public Library and the Libby app in my review of this great book. :)END OF YEAR UPDATE:I downgraded this book to 3.5 stars because I just didn't love it as much as some of my 4 star reads this year. It definitely stays with me in a haunting sort of way but I don't remember being as immersed in the story as much as some others and I didn't like the way the author's writing style was so detached and matter of fact, with very little exploration of emotions or details, just glossing over things and jumping ahead so far in time that I was left wanting more. I still liked it and would like to give another book of hers a try but it just wasn't up there with ""love it""... more like ""liked it."""
1888,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1124341-sunny-shore,Rating 5 out of 5,"Ann Patchett, you are always amazing us readers with your storytelling skills (Bel Canto, State of Wonder, Commonwealth) You never know where the story is going with Patchett as the story starts out small and like a luxurious, lush plant, grows flowers and petals. You have to stay with Patchett's books because by the last page, you have gained so much. I actually felt I'd grown from this book. The relationships between the character are so complex, human and real and many you will recognize in your own experiences. It is the story of loyalty and the love between siblings, of abandoned children, as well as adults. We go through 3 generations of the Conroy family, narrated by Danny, the son. It is sad and happy but mostly we root on Danny and Maeve with a certain pride as they begin their lives at Dutch House, a big mansion in suburban Philadelphia. This house has ""walls that talk"" and there is history preceding the Conroys, as well, introduced by former employees who have stayed on. When you read this complicated, beautifully written story, pay attention. You don't want to miss anything and although I never reread books, this is one I can see taking another look at. Its that good. Like Bel Canto, Commonwealth, State of Wonder (the ones of Patchett I have read) there is so much here to revel in, as a reader. Do yourself a favor and read it, but stay with it. Patchett doesn't write fast light books. She writes modern classics, which any reader who loves any genre will love. We are told the story is set between the 50s and present time (?), but that is not what is important. A modern classic could tackle any time period and still comes up shiny and new. When good writing and excellent themes, as well as a talented author, are in play, just immerse yourself. As a reader, you will be doing yourself a favor. And everyone will come away from Dutch House with different perspective, which is the ilk of any amazing book."
1889,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38401483-sam-young,Rating 3 out of 5,"lol i devoured this book to say the least!! i am happy to finally be reading a novel after so much academic/non fiction reading recently. and with that, i have OPINIONS!!!! okay so i have VERY mixed feelings about this book!! i’ll start with the positives lol. so i really enjoyed the pacing of the story and the overall plot read kind of like a beach read which is why i read it so quickly. i could definitely see myself in a lot of this book as well. i’m a very nostalgic person and one of the core themes of the book is nostalgia and it’s relationship with many of the characters. i also thought it was VERY interesting how woman-led the novel was! other than the narrator and a couple of other characters, the majority of the story is about women!! and women as complex characters (except maybe celeste lol). okay now for the bad LOL. first off, the formatting was kind of confusing!! they would jump back and forth from one scene when the danny was 6 and then in another hes 29! and it wasn’t like it added to the story either!!!! like i guess you could justify it as it is all in past tense so it’s all retrospective and that those two memories were somehow connected but i NEVER saw it!! second, once i got into the middle of the book, i felt like i had read this story before!!! archetypal new mom is mean and preys on her new stepchildren who later get back at her...like cinderella is that you??? it just started to feel too familiar that i wasn’t surprised by the majority of what happened by the end of the book. also at times the female characters seemed to be pitted against each other because of a MAN (danny) and tbh it wasn’t warranted! it was almost like danny was a pawn in all of their stories that they were trying to figure out where to place. not a bad thing necessarily, just something i noticed!! finally, it kind of made me think this book seemed made to become an A24 film rather than just be a book by itself....overall, it was a nice story and i enjoyed reading it but there were some glaring issues that i could not get over whilst reading! okay thanks for letting me rant!!"
1890,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12123802-julie,Rating 4 out of 5,"This Pulitzer prize nominee was my third book by Ann Patchett. While I think I appreciated both Taft and Commonwealth a little bit more, there was a lot to love about this family saga. For one thing, even though there was little to admire about the narrator, Danny, Patchett still managed to draw me completely into the story he tells. Her ability to skillfully manipulate the reader into caring about even a self-centered character is a testimony to her strength as a writer: no action or behavior goes unexplored, no emotion is left out, and there is no black and white, but always infinitesimally gradated shades of grey. Everyone has a backstory, and especially with this Henry Jamesian narrator, every story may be different from what he (or the reader) expects or describes. She writes so beautifully and so descriptively, without it feeling flowery or overblown. I could picture the characters and the scenes, and particularly the Dutch House, throughout the entire narrative.The story is, most of all, about the strength of a brother-sister bond, and Danny and Maeve's relationship is one of the most unbreakable I've found in fiction. Each flawed and trying to cope with their painfully difficult childhood, they lean on one other until they have to stop running from the past and confront the way they were left adrift by the adults who should have taken care of them.This may not be everyone's cup of tea, as it is extremely character-driven, but there are enough surprises along the journey that most readers should find something worthwhile. I recommend the audiobook, narrated by Tom Hanks; I listened as I read along and found that he was easily able to capture the joy, the rage, and the sadness of the characters.  "
1891,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"The author is great at portraying a dysfunctional family and dissecting each interaction. The narrator, Danny, shows no interest in people except for his sister, Maeve, who's like a mother to him. The story is really about Maeve who pushes him along in life, making almost every decision for him and he just goes along with it. The family was working class before he was born, then his father's business took off and he bought a ridiculously extravagant house. There's a theme of marital issues throughout the book. The father's first marriage where they were fundamentally different people, the second marriage where maybe they were too much alike?, and the Danny's marriage where he just didn't seem interested in his wife as a person. Another theme is men not seeing women as people with their own lives and interest. The father assumes what makes him happy will make his wife happy as well. The narrator knew nothing about the cook/maid in the house, people that have taken care of him all his life. The reason why he married his wife is because she makes herself ""not a distraction"", meaning she knows how to keep herself invisible like his maids.The book is about the struggle to let go of past grievances and moving on with life. It tends to jump around a lot between time periods. And I'm still curious about Maeve and Mr. Otterson's relationship, it seems like there was something there but it was never explicitly stated.Quotes:Danny ""she would ... make me a sandwhich and leave it on the table without comment the way Sandy and Jocelyn used to do. Celeste had been so adept at making me her job that I hadn't seen her doing it.""""I'd never been in the position of getting my head around what I'd been given. I only understood what I'd lost.""""Celeste blamed Maeve for everything she was afraid to blame me for.""Maeve ""I wish you could be happy about this,"" she said. ""But the truth is it doesn't matter. I'm happy enough for both of us."""
1892,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/120291824-kiki,Rating 2 out of 5,"2,5☆Округлять оценку не хочется, книга не понравилась.Сложно даже сказать, о чем она, просто очередной роман из списка книг, в которых ждешь одно, а получаешь другое. Это не семейная сага, не рассказ о роскошном, немного таинственном доме, скорее слишком сжатая биография главного героя, Дэнни, которая берет только верхушки основных событий его жизни, не давая возможности читателям сформировать мнение о чем-либо. Аннотация и обложка только сильнее сбивает с мыслей.Претензия к этой книге даже не в том, что это повседневная проза о — ну скажем честно — довольно скучной жизни средней семьи, а в том, как писательница ее подает. Поначалу кажется, что сюжет будет сосредоточен на детстве Дэнни и его старшей сестры Мэйв, работниках их богатого особняка, замкнувшего отца, неприятной мачехи, но нет. В какой-то момент ты находишь себя посреди нового этапа жизни Дэнни, и он еще более скучный, чем предыдущий. Ну то есть — нам показывают его жизнь вплоть до того, как его собственные дети выросли, причем ближе к концу книги скорость, с которой мы прыгаем из одного возраста Дэнни в другой, только увеличивается. Во всех второстепенных героях, за исключением родственников Дэнни, кухарки, няни и экономки, нет ничего такого, что могло бы удерживать интерес. Вероятно, это из-за того, что сам Дэнни, будучи взрослым мужчиной, так и не научился выражать свои эмоции, а так как книга написана от первого лица, то мы и видим все с его сухой точки зрения. В целом, не скучно было читать — или слушать, как в моем случае — только те главы, где Дэнни и Мэйв еще дети.Единственный трогательный элемент в этом романе — это отношения между братом и сестрой, хотя и они идеальными не кажутся. Мы видим, что Дэнни привязан к Мэйв не только, как к старшей сестре, но и матери, потому что та бросила их семью, и Мэйв фактически воспитывала и заботилась о Дэнни на протяжении всей его и своей жизней. Кусочки их совместного времени кажутся чуть ли не единственным плюсом книги, и поэтому в конце становится очень грустно. Две звезды в своей оценке посвящаю именно им двоим.С другой стороны, Дэнни рос в довольно травмирующей атмосфере, и если даже не применять это слово, то ему явно не хватало эмоционального воспитания, поэтому мы видим перед собой тусклого, черствого парня. Да, он любит свою сестру, но нет, прямо об этом он ей не говорит, впрочем, как и она. Но роман и задумывался как история о неправильной семье, только эта деталь сильно портить единственную вещь, которая мне понравилась в нем.Возвращаться к этой книге нет смысла, ничего нового она практически не дает, множество героев из взрослой жизни Дэнни быстро забываются, они лишены личностей, за ними неинтересно следить. Книга не оставляет после себя ни размышлений о чем-либо, ни интересных деталей, может быть, ее даже можно сравнить с картинами, которые висели в доме Дэнни и Мэйв — они есть и будут, но никому до них нет дела."
1893,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/158532191-abigail-hamner,Rating 3 out of 5,"This is my first time reading a book by Ann Patchett. I’m not usually one to read literary fiction, but this book was recommended to me by several people with whom I often share the same opinion about books, so I decided to give it a chance. Even though it’s literary fiction, it’s kind of like a combination of a modern day Cinderella (HELLO evil step mother!) and Hansel and Gretel (brother and sister fending for themselves) wrapped up in a heartbreaking coming of age story. It explores themes of poverty, religion, marriage, the importance of education, gender roles, and the impact that parents’ choices have on their children. Here’s my thoughts: ❤️ I LOVED the narration by Tom Hanks. This book is written in the first person narrative, and Tom Hanks really brought the voice of Danny to life for me. If you read this book, I definitely recommend listening to it on Audible. ❤️ I love Maeve! She’s such a queen. She’s spunky, independent, loyal, hard-working, and nurturing. ❤️ I loved the sibling relationship between Danny and Maeve. They’re the real duo. ❤️ I like how the author made such believable and relatable characters. Maeve’s stubbornness about her diabetes and how she refused to ask for help made her come to life for me. Danny’s resentment towards his mom was palpable. ❤️ Even though the plot is verrrrry sloowww, the unannounced changes in the timeline keep you on your toes and force you to pay attention. ❤️ Patchett really makes you care about the characters. Even though I wasn’t on the edge of my seat while reading this book, I had emotional reactions when things happened to the characters. I felt for them. 👎🏼 The plot is very slow. I feel like 40% of the content could be cut. But I guess that’s the whole point of the book. She focuses on creating characters and developing their personality and growth rather than furthering the plot or keeping you guessing. 👎🏼 Andrea. She’s the worst. That’s all. 👎🏼 Their mom is also the worst. There, I said it. 👎🏼 I think this style of writing is just not my vibe. Sorry not sorry. But Ann Patchett is a masterful writing and I have nothing but respect for her. "
1894,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20668719-wendy-bunnell,Rating 5 out of 5,"I received an ARC in exchange for an honest review, so thanks to the publisher and Goodreads for setting up the giveaway. I signed up for this giveaway because I really enjoyed Commonwealth. I read State of Wonder and didn't connect with it quite as much. But, I wanted to give this author another go, and I'm glad I did.The Dutch House is about property, family, and forgiveness. The title is the name of a house where our narrator, Danny, lives with his sister, Maeve, and their dad, Cyril. Their mom has disappeared when Danny was very young. He can hardly remember her. Then, their dad starts dating a new woman, Andrea, who moves in to The Dutch House with her two daughters (both younger than Danny), and Andrea takes over. Danny and Maeve are left to babysit their new step-sister while Andrea insinuates her way into every fascet of Cyril's life and business. One of Andrea's daughter's is given Maeve's room, displacing Maeve to the dreaded third floor which no-one ever visits.The atmosphere is pervasive. The series of jumping around in time reminds me of Commonwealth in that we see some scenes out of order. Danny and Maeve are continually drawn back to this house, even after the ugly events which cause a rift in their family. Can they forgive? Who all will they forgive? And what will it cost them, either to forgive, or to hold their anger and resentment?I'm a big believer of forgiving others, not because they deserve it, but because you deserve to not carry that anger and resentment around in your head and in your heart. This book is a beautiful exploration of living a life on the intersection of resentment and forgiveness. It's literary fiction, so don't expect a fast pace or lots of shock and awe. It does pack a powerful punch though that I'll probably feel for quite some time.  "
1895,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5816343-lisazj1,Rating 4 out of 5,"I have mixed feelings about this story, though the problems are all on my side. The story is a decades long look at the lives of a brother and sister, and the house they grew up in. The Dutch House and all that happened there and all the people they knew in it seemed forever interwoven into the fabric of their whole lives and touched everything in those lives, influenced decisions, education, careers, affected marriages and romances *or lack thereof, maybe*. I liked Danny & Maeve Conroy, brother and sister and for many years, the only family each other had, though they did have friends that were family too. But I didn't always like everything they did or the way they did it. There was plenty that was done wrong to them though and if nothing else, this book was the perfect example of how all things come back to you, both good and bad. And though there were things and people here that were just about impossible to like *ok, definitely impossible*, the way Ann Patchett turned the story had a way of making me unable to hold onto to my anger, even when I didn't want to let it go. The writing was excellent, the narrative smooth. It carried me along with the story so well that I wouldn't notice how much time passed while I listened. And there were some passages that were absolutely sublime, reminiscences or memories that made me remember too. And I have to give major props for my enjoyment of the book to the narrator, Tom Hanks. Listening to him read was marvelous. It honestly took me a couple of chapters to settle into his rhythm because sometimes he talks so damn fast I had to concentrate not to miss something. But his narration made this world live for me. Outstanding."
1896,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20539696-joshie-nicole-readwithjoshie,Rating 4 out of 5,"Thank you to my friends at HarperCollins for the review copy. The Dutch House is a riveting and gorgeously rendered modern day fairy tale, complete with castle and evil stepmother. The story follows Danny Conroy, son of real estate guru Cyril Conroy, through five decades of his life, from his time as a student into marriage and adulthood. The story is told in a non-linear fashion, jumping ahead in time and then back again, revealing more about the misfortunes and successes of the family Conroy. As more information is revealed about the fates and fortunes of the various characters, we grow further captivated by the mysterious force of the Dutch House at Elkins Park and its impact on all of those who live there.While the plot is engrossing, it is the characters that enchant the reader most. Maeve, Danny’s older sister, is a sharp and lovable presence in Danny’s life. The scenes between Maeve and Danny were my favourite’s throughout the novel. The entire cast of characters from Fluffy to Celeste, Cyril to Andrea, and even Bright and Norma felt fully realized, as though they could easily jump off of the page and into real life. The Dutch House was itself a character in this book; reminiscent of Manderley in du Maurier’s Rebecca, the house is as much a presence and force as any character. The house stays the same, unchanged throughout the narrative, offering a stark contrast and juxtaposition to our characters as well as a commentary on the way our memory impacts our decisions and perspectives. The house is fascinating. This was my first Ann Patchett of what I am sure will be many; I have fallen in love with Patchett’s atmospheric writing, her ability to craft characters that feel real, and the themes that she explores. I would recommend this book for fans of sweeping family dramas (think A Spool of Blue Thread, The Immortalists, or even A Tree Grows in Brooklyn)."
1897,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4375955-madeline-wright,Rating 4 out of 5,"Since I wrote a story about a house, I wanted to read another story about a house. :)This was a great story and I give it 4.5 stars.The best part for me is that this audiobook is narrated by Tom Hanks. I typically listen to audiobooks at 1.25x speed or faster depending on the density of the topic and my comfort at understanding the narrator's natural speaking pace. This is a 1x speed listening experience for me because 1) you should never rush Tom Hanks reading a story aloud and 2) he knows exactly how to modulate his reading speed to keep us engaged and hanging onto his every word. I would 100% recommend listening to the audiobook over the ebook or physical copy. 5 stars for that. Audio niceties aside, I thought the story was very well done.It made me feel like I was a fly on the wall of this Pennsylvanian family's life. Having the POV of the youngest child (Danny), the usage of the slow reveal via the eventual uncovering of the past as he grew up was a fitting way to tell the story. The only part I didn't care for was that it used the evil stepmother trope, a la Snow White. I get that it's a very popular fictional narrative for stepmother characters to be this way. See any classic Disney movie. Either that or she's a ""warm body"" stepmother, meaning this woman is present but otherwise has no significant development in relation to the protagonist. The stepmother storyline did redeem itself when the protagonist eventually matured and could see her as she was. The book left me feeling happy/sad at the conclusion which good books often do. I would recommend this title to people who like interesting family chronicles. Or Tom Hanks reading aloud. I enjoy both."
1898,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39306604-laura-tee,Rating 5 out of 5,"""We had made a fetish out of our misfortune, fallen in love with it. I was sickened to realise we'd kept it going for so long, not that we had decided to stop.""I honestly don't know why I enjoyed reading this so much. Perhaps because it is Cinderella for adults? The characters of the fairy-tale are fleshed out as real human beings in the real world. I feel as though I could meet Danny and Maeve in the street and I would know them. I mean really know them. I wouldn't idolise them in the style of an Elizabeth Bennett, but I would know them and empathise with their lofty aspirations, disappointments, pettiness, inconsistencies, and loyalty to one another. Perhaps it was Danny's 'voice'. Danny's introspection is truly relatable; I was first struck by his disappointment when he realises that he never took the time to learn anything about the women who kept house for his family during childhood. He realises that he has been egotistic to believe that they existed only for him, and to forget that they had lives independent of him, and he is ashamed that he never inquired about those lives. In this way, Patchett seamlessly handles the transition in Danny's voice from child to young adult to adult. His epiphanies are never grandiose or life-changing, but gentle and authentic, the way you might nod your head with recognition when you realise that you are distant enough from something in your past to finally see it for what it was. It mightn't be life-changing, but it might just alter your perception and, as a consequence, something about the way that you see yourself and your place in the world. It just felt very honest.I read 'Commonwealth' before and felt that it skimmed over interesting characters too quickly, but, if I were to criticise 'The Dutch House' at all, I would made the opposite criticism. 'The Dutch House' ties itself up all a bit too neatly. For such an honest narrative voice, the perfect circularity of the ending seems inauthentic and too tidy. But, despite that, I found this book utterly - and almost inexplicably - compelling. "
1899,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8700372-mahjabin-meem,Rating 5 out of 5,"I'm an only child. I've enjoyed it immensely and I never wished for any sibling. But this book made me want one. To have that unquestionable loyalty at your disposal at any given time, to have a Maeve of my own, a mother in a sister. On the surface, this book is about inheritance, revenge and loss. But at the heart of things, it is much more than that. There is so much love in this book, I could feel it spill out from the pages. Ann Patchett's writing is like a deep, calm lake, the water gently lapping at the shore. It is unfathomable to me then how this writing can cause such emotional turbulence in the reader. The relationship between Maeve and Danny is probably the best sibling relationship I've ever read. More often than not, siblings in literature are portrayed as rivals, the relationship fraught with hidden jealousy and betrayal. But there was no such thing here and I was immensely glad for that. A big part of this book is about how the past is altered in our minds even when we think our memory is infallible. 
“But we overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.”
One of the many things Ann Patchett is extremely good at is that she makes us one with the narrator, so it is almost impossible to have an objective view about the characters and their actions. It takes utmost mastery over character creation to be able to do that. And she is exactly that, a master at her craft. Our characters are obsessed with their past, living and reliving every moment, trying to hold onto every shred of emotion. 
“We had made a fetish out of our misfortune, fallen in love with it.”
I think most of us can resonate with emotion. But we also learn that unless you're willing to let of the past, you can never really move on to the future.If you're hesitant about whether it will live up to all the acclamation, just give it a try. You just might stumble upon a favorite of all time."

1901,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4930019-sara,Rating 5 out of 5,"I found this book to be quite humorous in its own little way. I mean, what other answer / what else is there to do from Maeve's point of view when you find yourself in a Cinderella situation because of an an evil step mother? Plus, the ostentatiousness of the house is sort of hilarious and its cycle through old money to new money, the idea of it being a fishbowl in a sense, etc. And Danny & Maeve's mother, Elna Conroy, was a bit of a Bernadette Fox from Where'd You Go Bernadette who was like... you know what? I don't dig being rich and all the nonsense that comes with it so she takes off and does a very rich white lady thing. Then there is Danny, the narrator (in my mind: Danny the lovable dud), who in a way represents all of the men in this novel. I was so confused by my own reaction to this book vs. other reviewers (yes I know the sibling bond, sweeping family saga is lovely but this book was also witty / bitingly funny) that I went and read some interviews with Patchett and she said that ""Danny was a very easy character for me to write because, oddly enough, I have known many men who are smart and charming and funny and interesting, who have no understanding of the fact that their whole life is built on the shoulders of the women who carry them around."" So I don’t feel like my takeaways were too off-base. I heard that Tom Hanks read for the audio book (!!) and I've got all my fingers crossed for a Wes Anderson film adaptation."
1902,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"""The Dutch House"" by Ann Patchett is domestic fiction at its core and a family novel that comes full circle by the end.The story revolves around two siblings - Maeve and Danny (who is also the narrator). As children, abandoned by their mother who left to help the disadvantaged overseas and a distant father who managed and owned rental property, the two had their lived changed when their house (called 'The Dutch House' for its history) is filled with three more people - their father's new wife, Andrea, and her two daughters.When their father passes away, Maeve takes on the motherly role for Danny who with his father's trust goes to medical school.It all sounds so simple, right? But Patchett does a good job of providing backstory and emotions that fill the novel with everyday scenes that somehow matter more than what's said. And this is because memory is a powerful thing.Memory makes us both experts and fools. Events tangle with emotion and the truth somehow is the future that can reconcile those things to make room for forgiveness and acceptance of the passage of time.That is what this novel does. Now, it's a bit depressing, I will say that. I don't think I'll read it again and wanted to get out of this world as soon as I could. But unlike other novels like this, this one worked as just a good piece of literature to peek into the lives of this family.Some of it was frustrating -storywise - but not the writing.At first I wondered if Danny was the right character to narrate the story, but as it went on I really did think by the end that as dry as his recollections were, they needed to be told that way to get a portrait - like the one discussed in the novel - that could tell without telling."
1903,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2528054-paige-connell,Rating 4 out of 5,"A modern-day Gothic novel, this story follows brother and sister Danny and Maeve from a very young age growing up in The Dutch House until 50 years later and all the events in between. Danny narrates the story, but he says late in the book, ""I was always meant to tell my sister's story,"" as Maeve and how he relates to her, her emotions, her tragedies, her experiences, her pull on his life are the real focus here. From the time they are young, Danny and Maeve must rely on each other--with a mother who runs off in the night, an emotionally-absent father, a nanny who is thrust out, an evil stepmother and her two young girls, and two servants who aren't allowed to be too close to them--all they have is each other. And as they age and go off to school, to college, into the real world, experience change, get married, find and leave jobs, find homes for themselves, etc., it becomes evident that their bond is the foremost tenet of their lives. Everything else pales in comparison. And all the while, The Dutch House pulls them back as well, causing them to wonder about their early lives.There are a lot of full-circle moments in this story, a lot of closure to character arcs, which is very satisfying. For a story that covers so much ground, it does so well. Danny is never happy unless he is with his sister, and Maeve just never seems happy. It's a powerful character examination. And I strongly recommend the audiobook, narrated by THE Tom Hanks, a wonderfully soothing narrator, who takes all the phrases and all the descriptions and makes them come alive."
1904,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/114814305-ginny-muse,Rating 4 out of 5,"I think my overall interest in and enjoyment of this story is maybe 3⭐️; but the audio by Tom Hanks helps it be 4⭐️ - so I’ll let my 3 1/2 stars round up to 4. (This might be because it got so many good reviews - I feel like I should round up. I’ve definitely enjoyed other 4⭐️ books more. I’d only recommend this on audio. I only got this book on audio because everyone said it was so good. ) I found this to be a pretty sad tale! I kept hoping for more redeeming qualities. This family saga tells us mostly about a boy, Danny, his sister Maeve, their dysfunctional family and their life in and outside of The Dutch House. The father, Cyril, seems cold and distant. The mother, Elna, leaves her family - 2 young children - to go travel the world and serve the poor and help the needy! (??!!?? This did not sit well with me!) Cyril remarries a rude woman named Andrea who has 2 daughters. When.the father dies Andrea kicks Danny out of the house! With no money - no nothing! (What?!) Young adult Maeve picks him up and becomes his caretaker - then forces him to go through medical school just to use up as much money as possible in the family education fund to spite Andrea. Even though he doesn’t want to be a doctor. They grow up and more unusual circumstances occur, but I won’t list more. It’s odd. And it all revolves around the house. At least Maeve and Danny like and support each other. (But Danny’s wife and Maeve don’t get along.) And their childhood housekeepers seemed to genuinely care for them, and be more family than their blood family. The story is often choppy - back and forth between past and present. There is love, and their is sadness, but it didn’t connect me emotionally very much. I just thought ‘that’s sad.’ Parts were bizarre! So it is kind of interesting. But not very enjoyable."

A casa que visito em sonhos tantas e tantas noites - inclusive esta noite - ainda que já tenha passado dos trinta. Olhar mais uma vez o cantinho do guarda roupa que gostava de me esconder quando ainda cabia sentada dentro dele, ou o recadinho que meu primeiro namorado deixou escrito de lapis na porta no banheiro. Andar novamente pelo pátio em que corremos de patins com os primos, quando estar com primos ainda era uma realidade na nossa vida - minha e do meu irmão. Na minha mente, sempre imagino poder abrir alguma das enormes janelas de venezianas de madeira escura, só para encontrar um dos gatos dormindo entre o peitoril e a grade. Daria tudo até mesmo para novamente, e sem querer, ficar triste porque pisamos nos caracóis do jardim em época de chuva. Queria armar as redes no pátio e balançar depois de escurecer, ou ver meu irmão cair porque errou a maneira de dar nó nos punhos. Sinto saudades de todos os medos que a casa me dava também, mas os medos não vou listar… A casa esteve lá comigo tanto quando meus pais, ou talvez até muito mais que eles.

1906,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21112323-rebecca-laporte,Rating 3 out of 5,"Tom Hanks narrating this book made it so much better, he is truly an enjoyable narrator. I really wanted to love this book, it is outside of my usual genre and I thought why not, a family saga that sweeps generations and is centered around the house that made and broke their family. I found myself wanting to know what was going to happen, I was just bored. There is nothing special about the family, nothing special about the good and bad things that happen. I just listened to their random lives and found myself wanting to figure out what our authors deeper meaning was meant to be. Maybe forgiveness? Maybe that you are more than your past and how you can overcome your hurdles and end up being just like the parent that let you down?I'm honestly not sure. I didn't hate the book, but I didn't see the point. We went through the trauma of Danny & Maeve's mom leaving when they were young children, then the hurt when she came back like 40 years later. We went through the death of their father and their step mothers greed casting them out.Then we spend the majority of this book with Danny & Maeve sitting outside the home smoking cigarettes and just talking about the past.I just never felt satisfied with any of it. There was never a resolution to their anger or pain, when things got hard the just ignored it and moved along. It was odd. I am glad Tom Hanks kept me listening, but overall I can't recommend this book, not because there were many things wrong, just because I found it to be very boring. "
1907,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5431869-andreea,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Dutch House is was an engrossing and addictive read, very much in the Ann Patchett style that I know and love. So it is not a plot driven book, but rather a character study, an exploration of emotions and identity, of the self and of how relationships can define your life. It is story of two children - Maeve and Danny - losing their home, but more importantly, it is a story of two children who lose their parents and are left drifting through life with only each other to hold on to - and that is why their relationship becomes so obsessive, feeling the need to share everything with each other, to always have each other's approval and to constantly reminisce. In absence of a family home, they keep returning to the house they used to share with their parents before these disappeared from their lives,the last place where they can remember being happy, but from which they were banished by their stepmother. For me, this story is also about people's fascination with things, objects, possessions. Cyril Conroy, Maeve and Danny's father, grows up very poor and becomes very wealthy as an adult through real estate transactions. A few years after marrying Elna, he makes no effort to get to know his young wife, but assumes she will be mesmerised by opulence in the same way that he is so he gives her the Dutch House as a present. Overwhelmed by the life her husband created for them, Elna bails on him and her two children. Different characters in the book say that Elna left because she couldn't live in the house, because she was a saint who wanted to help others; selfless. However, I cannot forget the fact that she abandoned her children to a life she hated. While there might have been a danger that this is a story describing 1st world problems in the odd setting of a flamboyant and opulent house, once you read it you realise it is a story about universal problems like loss, identity, death, abandonment, loneliness. I found it very easy to identify with the characters in the book, especially Danny, and very difficult to put this book down once I started reading."
1908,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5709329-samantha,Rating 4 out of 5,"I am so excited to finally be writing a review for The Dutch House! Ann Patchett is one of my all time favorite authors and this book had been on my TBR for months. I don't typically listen to fictional audiobooks (I usually use that platform for non-fiction), but my mom convinced me to give it a try and I'm so glad that I did. (It also definitely doesn't hurt that Tom Hanks reads the story and does an amazing job - feel better Tom and Rita!!!!)The book is told from the perspective of Danny Conroy, and spans over the course of his life - from early childhood to his mid-50's. Danny grew up in the famed Dutch House with his sister (Maeve), his father, their staff, and eventually his father's second wife (Andrea) and her daughters. Danny & Maeve's lives are shaped dramatically by their time in the house and the two continue to see its impact throughout adulthood. The story showcases dysfunctional families and the emotional connections that come from them, and explores how time can change our memories and perspectives but ultimately is the best healer of the damage we can cause one another. I know I already said this, but I seriously love Ann Patchett. Her ability to create emotional connections in readers to her characters is seriously an art. For me, Maeve was hands down the best character in the book. I absolutely loved the relationship between Maeve & Danny - I am super close with my own brother so watching their sibling dynamic was especially relatable (I think the only other book I've ever read that did such a good job with a brother/sister relationship was A Tree Grows in Brooklyn). So if you have a sibling you're close with, you'll love this book!I was also extremely pleasantly surprised by how much I liked the audiobook. I encourage everyone to give it a shot - while we're all stuck at home with limited to access to other people, listening could be a nice change of pace from your traditional book. Plus, most libraries/bookstores are making access to audiobooks as easy and inexpensive as possible. Support your local bookstores, people!!!Overall, I loved this book. Ann Patchett is amazing, and if you're already a fan of hers you will not be disappointed. Also, her bookstore in Nashville, Parnasus Books, is one of my all time favorites and you should definitely check it out if you're ever in town. Can't wait to hear everyone else's thoughts on this book!"

It didn't really have an intriguing plot, and sometimes a book has no plot but all the vibes! Only this one didn't really have a vibe either. The writing and the characters were well enough to finish the book, so It's in no way a bad book, but.. it just didn't do much.I don't know if the author wanted to say how you should always forgive people as like the lesson of the story? But I just hate that way of thinking, so I can't really find myself in that either.The characters are also a bit mary sue. How does the main character just end up rich again like it's easy? His daughter becomes some celebrity like it's all so easy. Oh medical school? Sure straight As even if he wasn't interested in anything of that study. Didn't love that. It all felt so easy. Also, I could've done with some more serious conversations instead of Maeve spoke to mom. I wasn't there. Im sure it was meaningful, I never really talked to mom until I did later on.Idk couldn't really find myself in any of that.I also don't get how Maeve forced him to throw away like 10 years of his life for her revenge, and nobody was mad at her for it?Also I was so confused with the time period of the book. Like it said the years, but it felt like modern day most of the time? I only sometimes realized it wasn't when they spoke about WO2. Maeve seemed so modern? While she is a bit older than my mother would be in the time of the book. And my mom grew up so differently and thinks so differently. Not like bad things, but generations are different and maeve and the other kids felt like they were born in the 90s? Not the 50sThe only thing about the book that I liked was that you somewhat did start a relationship with the characters. I did want to find out what happened to them. I just didn't care enough about the things that did happen. Which is maybe just all on me? Just wasn't my book, and that's fine."
1910,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/110258954-emily-minness,Rating 4 out of 5,"The Dutch House is a wonderful story of the love between siblings, complex family networks, friendships and nostalgia. Maeve and Danny’s mother has left the family - they’re living in this grand house of glass & memories - and they’re father remarried. A story of an “evil” stepmother, who enters the family house along with her two own children. Upon the death of their father, Maeve & Danny are forced to forge their own paths in life, away from the Dutch House and all its memories. The storytelling of Ann Patchett in this acclaimed novel is superb - the characters that she’s formulated are strong, identifiable and true to form. We follow the lives of these siblings, as they age...realise their potentials and strive to survive their personal tribulations. Maeve mainly fights against her health, whereas Danny strives to achieve a career in Real Estate, much like his father. The narrative continuously curbs back towards the Dutch House as Danny and Maeve often find themselves seated in a car outside of the property, reminiscing and tackling emotive conversations whilst observing the properties happenings unfold before them.A beautiful work of fiction - a very character oriented story, with minimal plot, but this does not in anyway take from the story’s splendour. After picking this book up, I found myself unable to stop reading until I reached the very end. It’s nice in some respects to read a book which doesn’t feel the need to be packed full of action! This book was long listed for the 2020 Women’s Prize for Fiction, and rightly so! "

Patchett draws in the reader with clever hints and teasers right from the get-go and my only complaint is that it didn't last me longer.The characters are so immaculately written that you find yourself lost in their world over 50-odd years. The relationship between Danny and Maeve is possibly the most beautiful of any fictional work I've ever read, and as both an older sister and the partner of a diabetic myself, the emotions I encountered in reading this book were deep and enlightening. There are several villains in the story (Andrea, Celeste, Elna) and numerous heroes (Sandy, Jocelyn, Morie, Otterson, Fluffy, May, Norma...) but there is one central character on whom I'm completely undecided: Cyril. Is he a proud, selfish and weak-minded victim of his own business success, or is he really a caring father who ultimately had his children's best interests at heart, and made just one mistake in putting his faith in Andrea over Fluffy? Is Danny a hero in his own right, or is he simply an evolved version of his father, making the same mistakes and bad decisions he specifically wanted to avoid? This beautiful mystery means I may have to read it again to resolve my feelings and I would honestly be excited to do so.Big shout-out to Bae for the awesome Secret Santa gift :)"

This is not the typical kind of book that I'd pick up - I'm actually not sure how it ended up on my ""To Read ""list - but the author's writing style really drew me in. I enjoyed reading it; I'm just not sure how I felt about the ending.  I think I was waiting for more resolution to the story, a more satisfying explanation for why Danny's mom left, or at the very least, an honest conversation between Danny and his mom where he explains to her how much her selfishness hurt him and she finally understands the consequences of her actions. The mom was aggravating to me, and I didn't understand all the characters who were so quick to excuse her and call her a good person. Even until the end, she did not see why her disappearance was so traumatic for her children. I do get that maybe the point was to leave it unresolved, because that's how Danny felt. He never got the closure he wanted, and he chose to move on anyway. But, as a reader, I was still left feeling kind of like....that's it? Also, Danny kind of annoyed me as a protagonist. I felt bad for him as a child, but as an adult, his condescending ""she makes my life easier"" attitude towards his wife, and his decision to finish all of medical school just because Maeve wanted him to, made me lose respect for him. I did think it was interesting how the whole thing came full circle at the end, when he found out that Celeste never liked the house he bought for her as a surprise. "
1913,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2953390-patricia-bracewell,Rating 4 out of 5,"I wonder if this story about a brother and sister thrust out of their home by a cold-hearted step-mother was initially inspired by the tale of Hansel & Gretel. The siblings band together to help each other in the aftermath, clinging together for support and comfort. The similarlity ends there, of course.The disinheritance of children from a previous marriage is a common enough event. (It happened in my own family.) I was surprised, though, given that the father was a successful businessman and had a fraught relationship with wife #2, that the father would not have made some provision for his children beyond a college fund for his son. That was the only aspect of the plot that rang false to me. (I can imagine Patchett stewing over how to make that believable. She did her best, I'm certain.)I enjoyed this story, set in the late 20th c. It was a comfortable read, and I really had no idea from one page to the next what was going to happen. I found it intriguing that the first person narrator is the younger brother rather than the elder sister. Although the sister is the prime mover and decision-maker, his life is of greater interest to Patchett and thus to the reader. He seems to know very little about his sister's inner life, and Patchett sacrifices the sister's story so that the brother's can be highlighted. Nevertheless, it's Maeve who gets her portrait on the cover of the book. Perhaps a fair exchange?"

I think it's a good omen when you kick the year off with a cracker read, and this was indeed a cracker read!I picked this up as it had a lot of buzz and several friends had reccomended it. I wasn't paying that much attention when I started reading it; I had it in my head that the author was Anne Tyler, an author I kind of like but I'm not that red hot about. Within a page I immediately knew - I'm loving every brilliant word, this is not Anne Tyler.That's when I realised it's Ann Patchett, who wrote one of my most favourite collections of essays ever. It's called This is the Story of a Happy Marriage and it's fabulous, especially when she writes about writing, and dogs. You should definitely read it, if you haven't.The Dutch House is also excellent. It tells the story of a brother (Danny), his older sister (Maeve), and a house, the Dutch House. Before Danny was born, and Maeve was young, their father brought the house as a lavish surprise for his wife. It's truly opulent - all gleaming glass and chandeliers, marble floors, gilt ceilings, velvet, silk, damask, and a ballroom on the third floor. Danny and Maeve's mum feels immediately uncomfortable in the house; she feels she doesn't belong there amongst all that opulence and after a few years disappears, running away to India.This is a family saga. We follow Danny and Maeve over five decades, through their traumas and triumphs big and small. At the heart of it all is the wonderful bond between brother and sister - both protective of each other, both sharing a dark humour over eveything they've endured. I adored the way Patchett wrote about this sibling bond; my favourite parts were Maeve and Danny sitting in Maeve's car, parked outside the house, smoking, chatting. I could've happily read a whole book just of their car chats...My rambling isn't in any way doing the book justice, but trust me, it's a good one. There's enough unanswered questions to keep you interested the way a mystery might, but the writing is so good - warm yet clear, clever yet real - that you don't really need it. And the house...what a character the house is!I'm giving it four family portraits, painted in oils ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ps. I should add that really I shouldn't like this book as it plays on the evil step-mother stereotype, but even that didn't put me off! I think Ann Patchett is a very deliberate thoughtful writer, and she explored this fairytale trope for a reason..."
1915,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1782163-deb,Rating 5 out of 5,"I both read and listened to this book (I really, really enjoyed listening to Tom Hanks narrate the audiobook!) and have given it 4.5 stars as I really liked it.I admired how cleverly Patchett wove together a number of different elements through the use of one main motif: the Dutch House. I liked how she wove multiple stories together under this symbol. These stories encompass the characters in the novel, the repetition of some of the the stories (events) and even the types of stories. The characters are, well, all of them. Somehow, ALL of the characters in the novel have a connection to the Dutch House -- even if it is from afar or via memory. The repetition of stories connects to the characters as well as themes and the fact that certain events repeated itself... the story of abandonment (emotional, physical, death), the story of love (between parents and children, between caretakers and care-ees, between husbands and wives and, most importantly, between siblings). Another element of the 'stories' is the fact that it really felt like it held fairy-tale elements (agree, Helen??) and this is what I meant by ""types"" of stories. Celeste, Danny's wife, refers to Hansel and Gretel at one point and I really found that apropos. Danny and Maeve could be these two young, parent-less children wandering the world and lulled by / influenced by the candied house which Patchett calls ""the Dutch House""... There are also elements of the evil stepmother (Cinderella, anyone)... But it is ultimately a story of a dysfunctional family held together (I think) by Maeve, the girl who's painting stood at the heart (literally and metaphorically) of the house. It is a story of the love Maeve and Danny had for each other (sibling) and how that panned out throughout the decades."
1916,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7400591-writer-s-relief,Rating 5 out of 5,"In Ann Patchett’s powerful novel, the Dutch House is an architectural marvel located in the Philadelphia suburb of Elkins Park. After accumulating wealth through savvy real-estate dealings, Cyril Conroy purchases the Dutch House as a gift for his wife. Within this lavish estate, the stage is set for the dramatic events that will shape the lives of the brother-sister duo, Danny and Maeve Conroy, and their extended family and friends. Unaccountably abandoned in early childhood by their mother—who may or may not have fled their opulent home to minister to the poor in India—the siblings are again unmoored a decade later when their stepmother, Andrea, forces them out of the house following the sudden death of their father.Over the course of five decades, this luminous tale of the children’s privileged beginnings unfolds into a story of stunning reversal of fortune and paradise lost. Incorporating familiar fairy tale and mythic themes of the wicked stepmother, abandonment, betrayal, loss, and redemption, this engrossing story captures the journey of Danny and Maeve from childhood to middle-age and features a memorable cast of fully fleshed-out characters, all of whom will likely linger in readers’ memories long after their story has been told. A definite must-read!"
1917,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2587533-alarie,Rating 5 out of 5,"My fifth novel by Patchette, I give it five stars like three of the others. The Dutch House, a mansion in Pennsylvania, acts as a character in the book: some members of the Conroy family would call it the hero, others the villain. It’s a quieter book than her other novels, and to me it’s better for that. It begins as a coming of age story, but we follow the main child characters, Maeve and her brother, Danny (the narrator) into middle age. It’s about family dynamics, what can scar us, who and what can fill the gaps left by family, what we can or cannot forgive. Even the people we love most can sometimes seem like strangers.The story feels genuine (even drama queens and people who perpetually make bad choices appear in most families, right?). Patchett shares a lot of psychological insights most of us can identify with. As I read, I kept worrying she was going to close with one of those explosive, out-of-nowhere endings that have been annoying me lately. I should have known from experience that Patchett would stay on target.A perfect finishing touch is the book jacket. It represents a portrait described in the book of 10-year-old Maeve. It annoys me when books have people on the covers who look nothing like the descriptions of the characters."
1918,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3840034-christina,Rating 2 out of 5,"A bit baffled by all the raving reviews—it was fine for me, but not really interesting or particularly enjoyable. The narrator seemed so strangely self-absorbed and emotionless to me in a way that was confusing and dull, and as for Maeve, the book’s original namesake according to Patchett, I just couldn’t see how this was supposedly about her. The characterizations all bled into each other, and I didn’t really get the sense of closeness that the narrative wanted me to believe (I wonder if part of that had to do with the fact that, based on personal experience, I found it difficult to buy into the fact that a brother and sister with 7 whole years between them would be the very best of friends). I enjoyed the somewhat unspoken theme about how so much of what men have is due to the women in their lives who carry them and support them (except for the mother who really was indecipherably obtuse, and the stepmother whose potential was better portrayed in the Disney live-action remake of Cinderella than was utterly unattempted in this book), but for the most part I felt like this was just a series of unremarkable and often cliched events that showed me very little of what Patchett was apparently trying to convey. Seemed almost hokey to me, but I’m clearly in the minority."

Das verworrene Leben der dysfunktionalen Familie und vorallem der Geschwister Danny und Maeve wird über Jahrzehnte verfolgt und erzählt.Das Buch besticht durch seinen Realismus. Die Charaktere sind alles andere als perfekt, was die geschilderten Leben sehr glaubwürdig und eindrücklich machen. Themen wie Freundschaft, Liebe, Vergebung und Obsession spielen in der Geschichte eine sehr große Rolle.Ich habe das Buch zusammen mit 2 Freundinnen für unseren Buchclub gelesen und finde es sehr spannend, dadurch Bücher zu lesen, zu denen ich ansonsten nicht greifen würde. Diese ruhige und sehr charakterbezogene Alltagsgeschichte war auf jeden Fall beeindruckend und für mich mal etwas anderes. Das einzige Problem das ich mit dem Buch von Zeit zu Zeit hatte, ist dass ich einfach keine Bindung zu den Charakteren oder zu der Geschichte aufbauen konnte. Die vielen Zeitsprünge und schwierigen Charaktere haben mich etwas aus der Geschichte herausgenommen. Ich denke aber, dass das eher an meinen Lesegewohnheiten und meinem Geschmack liegt und weniger am Buch selbst.Beeindruckende Familiensaga, nur einfach nicht ganz nach meinem Geschmack."
1920,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/108041326-siobhan,Rating 5 out of 5,"This was an outstanding read. I loved everything about the story and the characters. Danny narrates this book. He grew up in the Dutch House with his sister Maeve, who he is very close with. After some family drama the two of them are kicked out of this house and now have to navigate their new life with only a trust fund to be used for educational purposes. The story spans several decades and tells the tale of these siblings and the impact the Dutch House and their family issues had on them. I thought the writing was beautiful. The whole novel held a fairly mellow tone throughout. I laughed a few times at the some of the comments made by Danny as he got older and more sarcastic. The descriptions were perfectly detailed that the reader could picture the house and the surroundings instantly, especially the painting of Maeve.What made this book so great for me was the relationship Danny and Maeve had. I didn’t know what to expect from this book, thinking it was just about the lives of two siblings but the writing makes it so much deeper than that. I was so fond of those characters, I would happily read their story again. As well as being fairly sad at points I found it to be a very comforting, wholesome read. "
1921,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1404381-ai-jou,Rating 5 out of 5,"From the moment I read the sample first chapter of this book, I knew I would buy this book and read it. The novel is about Maeve and Danny, two siblings who lived in a sprawling 3-storey mansion known as The Dutch House with their cold, unemotional father, housekeeper, nanny and cook. Their mother left when Danny was just 3 years old. Danny has never known his mother so he is very close to his sister, who became a surrogate mother of sorts. As the narrator of the story, Danny shares his memories about the house, his family, their lives and the stepmother his father eventually marries. After his death, the siblings are thrown out by their stepmother and go from riches to rags, picking up their lives bit by bit. This is a very touching story about childhood memories that are tied to where we grow up, the trauma that occurs when the family unit is broken, and the choices we take in adulthood (which are all somehow tied back to our childhood experiences). It is a bittersweet novel that explores relationships, choice vs automated reactions, love and loss, family, forgiveness and our deepest roots. This was my first Ann Patchett book and I really enjoyed her writing. Reviewers did not rank this title as the best book she's ever written, and boy, am I looking forward to reading more!"
1922,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8161805-karen,Rating 4 out of 5,"Danny Conroy gracefully narrates this magnificent story centered around his childhood home in the beautiful suburbs of Philadelphia. After their mother disappeared, his older sister Maeve and the housekeepers essentially raised Danny while their father ran a successful real estate empire. Lonely but loved, the siblings adapted. After a few years their father married a much younger woman named Andrea. She moves into The Dutch House with her two young daughters and incrementally takes over their lives. Ultimately exiled by this evil selfish woman, Danny and Maeve find themselves torn from the only home and family they have ever known. This house becomes the obsessive center of their lives and every important decision is later made with a mix of regret and resentment based on this profound loss. A deep-seated attachment to the past and unfaltering commitment to each other breeds jealousy from Danny’s wife and solitude for Maeve’s future. Told over a period of fifty years, The Dutch House is more than just a house, it is a tale of love and hope. Every day we live our lives we are making memories, whether you realize it or not."

Tom Hanks' lovely voice encouraged me to keep listening (my son wanted to know why I was listening to Woody read a story haha) and I am so glad that I did. I felt like the story wasn't going anywhere. But now that I am done, I realized that a story doesn't have to ""go"" anywhere to be brilliant. And this book was brilliant. Quite basically, the story of a brother and sister who only had each other to depend on and of the home that shaped their lives. It was touching and sad but full of forgiveness and hope in the end. There are some things I didn't understand (like why didn't Maeve ever look for her mother?) but I was able to overlook that. I think I am going to have to go look for Patchett's other works - I'm a fan.And 7 million stars for Tom Hanks' narration. There is something to be said for having a familiar voice read you a book - and he could read the yellow pages (is there still such a thing?) and I'd listen to all it. "
1924,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10050737-lisa-eckstein,Rating 5 out of 5,"Danny is eight and Maeve is fifteen when their father first brings Andrea to the Dutch House for a tour. The house, Dutch because of its original owners, is a grand home outside Philadelphia that Danny and Maeve's father purchased in 1946 for their mother, who left when Danny was too small to remember. By the time Danny is fifteen, he and his sister no longer live at the Dutch House, but Andrea does. The siblings begin a habit of parking on the street outside the house to observe and discuss, a tradition they continue for decades. As Danny grows up and makes a family of his own, his bond with Maeve remains central to his life, and for good or bad, so does their past in the house.I loved this book and the brother-sister relationship at its core. Patchett is a master at crafting distinctive, fully realized characters, and I now feel like I've known Danny and Maeve personally all these years. The portrayal of a long span of time with the aid of quick jumps forward and back is similar to Patchett's equally excellent COMMONWEALTH, though this novel's approach is more methodical. The confidently rendered characters and structure, the engrossing story, and the subtle humor place THE DUTCH HOUSE among my favorite books of the year and confirm Patchett as one of my favorite authors."
1925,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"Never in my life has Tom Hanks read me a book and it was AMAZING. It is an experience I hope to repeat soon and often. When Tom Hanks tells me terrible things, I believe in my heart that things will still be okay and they will still work out for the protagonist. Such is the power of Tom Hanks. This book is a meditation on motherhood by a boy without a mother. As he grows, he sees the acts a mother would perform for a child in the actions and inactions of others. His dreadful stepmother is the kind of person who feels that other people should put her first and feels wronged when others don’t love her. She feels owed this loved despite how poorly she treats other people. She is the kind of deluded, fragile, self absorbed person who takes out her own insecurities on a child. This story is about imperfect relationships and about bonds of love so strong they can overcome that which threatens us, that which makes us feel lesser than, that which embitters our hearts, and shifts in how we see others that occur over time and with changes that accomplish the same thing. I loved this book. Finally a good book to read during COVID19."
1926,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9778469-alison,Rating 4 out of 5,"Themes of wealth & poverty, love, betrayal & forgiveness, obsession and inheritance are woven through this non-linear family tale that spans 5 decades. It's Maeve's story but it's narrated by her younger brother Danny, who has essentially lived Maeve's life, for his entire life, instead of living his own. In ways it is a modern day fairy tale with a creepy gingerbread house (as much an important character as the rest and the catalyst for much of what happens) and an evil step-mother who gains the house but loses everything and everyone else. It explores memory in all its faulty glory: ""But we overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we're not seeing it as the people we were, we're seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered."" And it shows how people can become trapped in their past and carry it as a burden forward through everything. I really liked this novel but I didn't love it; the writing was superb but there were places where leaps of disbelief were too great to take. I kept waiting for something to 'happen'; it was going somewhere but the author never quite delivered on what she promised. The difficulty I have reconciling unsympathetic characters with a truly great read is not the author's fault though, it's entirely mine."

It’s definitely a competent novel but I felt like it lacked some level of depth or spark somehow. I never felt very emotionally attached to the characters, they felt a bit flat to me (and given the fact that they were kind of messed up, it was a little jarring for them to seem so flat really). Although I’ve seen it described as a fairy tale in reviews, and it does have some fairy tale tropes, I didn’t feel like that was all that legitimate of a description. Maybe some unsatisfying air of coming full circle counts but it was hard for me to give it credit for that in the fairy tale department, really. I also struggled with pace, felt the first hundred pages meandered and I almost stopped reading. I did make it to the end — once it got going it did finally compel me to want to read the conclusion. 3 stars for being definitely technically well written, but I am surprised it was nominated for the Pulitzer. Like I said, it was a competent novel but it didn’t really knock me out — maybe that’s just a matter of taste though. "

I expected more from a book with so many starred reviews.The Dutch House follows the lives of two siblings, Danny and Maeve, through about fifty or so years. Danny and Maeve are smart people who find success in their careers, but cannot leave their past behind. It's an interesting premise, and I was excited to read about it. I'd complain about the slow pacing in the beginning, but I think my biggest problem was with the characters. I just couldn't connect to them. The story itself would be compelling, I think, if the characters were compelling. Pretty much every character fell flat for me. I'm honestly too tired right now to write thoroughly on my thoughts. Aside from the lack of character development (Danny and Maeve felt virtually the same throughout the story! I feel like Danny should have felt like a different person by the end!), the centerpiece of the story was not well fleshed-out. Danny and Maeve can't leave their past behind, yes, but that part of the story, which should have been the centerpiece, only flashed in once in a while to remind me that it existed. It wasn't omnipresent, as I feel it should have been, if Danny and Maeve were so attached to their past."

For multiple reasons, including the story -- which is a kind of a meandering exploration of the lives of the Conroy family, namely Maeve and Danny, siblings who grow up in a giant house in PA post WWII-- has kind of a relaxed pacing which flowed better for me in audio form (too put-down-able in print form). And more importantly, Tom Hanks narrates the audio and goddamn is there anything he doesn't make tremendous? It was quite something listening to him give this story so much TLC, just shines. Which is especially helpful because after I finished the book I thought about it and the story, which is from the POV of Danny, the younger Conroy sibling, is kind of a Nick Carroway figure, telling about the peaks and valleys of al the other more charismatic characters in his family. Anyway, I'm hit or miss on Ann Patchett, because I think they do take a bit to lure you in and because they are gentler and more meandering and internal storywise. But ultimately I did like it and I will always love Tom Hanks."

Two achingly crafted characters, a brother and a sister, navigate ten decades through 337 pages. In the background of it all is this hauntingly beautiful home with a treasure trove of history. The book navigates themes of loyalty, family, legacy, shame, growing up, and *home*—in every loaded sense of the word. Ann Patchett has written a story that enveloped me instantly with a subtle style of enchantment. It doesn’t hit you over the head, but creeps over you like fog in a field. The prose is admirable and makes you stop to read it over again. “A high-pitched whine seemed to emanate from her misery, like fluorescent tubing just before it burns out, like tinnitus, something nearly imperceptible that almost drove me to insanity”.“The person in the chair then shook her head and stretched her long legs out in front of her, pointing her bare toes. Still, miraculously, the illusion held, and I looked up into the blanket of stars to keep myself from seeing too clearly.”Pick this book up if you want to be welcomed into the world of Danny, Maeve, and the Dutch House, by a pair of chilling, gossamer arms."

Can't put into words how much I dislike this book and the incessant feeling of strangeness and empty grief that sticks with you throughout reading it. Its brilliant and reflects the stark reality of so many overwhelming events and emotions almost too well. No definitely too well. Severely dislike the mother. Complicated disgust and pity. Incredibly bothered by the father. And Danny's explicit likeness to him is frustratingly familiar. Really really well written with calm prose building up to hard hitting poetic one liners. Presents the concept of childhood in the exact same way I think about it : long and unbearable. Elicits really uncomfortable and frustrating ideas of forgiveness and guilt. Leaves you thinking endlessly about the house and the emotions, past present and future, so cruelly embedded into every corner, somehow both painstakingly static and fluid with the changing time and ages of the characters.

If you are going to read this book -do it that way. It made it so fabulous - Tom Hanks was the perfect voice of charming exasperation and truthfulness that made this story come to life in a way that I don't think I would have experienced had I simply read the book. I do like Ann Patchett books but it was a total coup to have him as the narrator. So because I am not sure where the story falls (because I was so head over heels obsessed with how the narration came together so well) I'm only giving it 4 stars - to recognize that if I had just read the book my experience wouldn't have been as grand as the audio version. Also I listened to this via my paid subscription to Scrib'd and I love that app - it's a little clunky but man, it's been ideal so I'm not using all my audible credits when I don't want to wait in line for a library copy (20 weeks out? 20 weeks out?

Dutch House is a well thought out and written story of one family, in all its authenticity and dysfunctionality. What I loved the most was how Danny’s character mirrored his father’s – both become enigmas to their children, and considering that Danny is the narrator, it fascinates me how his offspring are mostly absent from all those decades’ worth of storytelling. Instead, Patchett puts the relationship between Danny and his sister Maeve in the center, and it works on every possible level. It was so refreshing to read a book where the sibling rivalry has no place, where their relationship is so full of love and caring (which might be due to the circumstances but also might as well just because they genuinely love each other and we shouldn’t go looking for reasons why). There are many fairytale tropes and undertones in the book, there’s some degree of darkness to the Dutch House as well, but it’s a kind of inviting darkness, which one can’t get enough of. "

I'm sort of a sucker for the spans-a-whole-lifetime genre of storytelling. This one is narrated by Danny beginning when he's a boy and spanning his lifetime of hardships and successes, family loss, med school, marriage and divorce, and raising kids. The title refers to the house that defined him—where his mom abandoned the family, where he spent his childhood trying to live up to his dad's expectations, and from where he is banished by his step mom as a young teen after the death of his father. As almost an obsession over the decades, Danny and his older sister Maeve (his best friend turned guardian) return over and over to sit across the street from the Dutch House looking in and wondering about what's become of it and those who still live inside. I really enjoyed this book, even though there wasn't a ton of resolution in the end. But such is the way of life. And I feel like this book was such a beautifully and compellingly written story of the way life plays out in a dysfunctional family and how love can win in the end, even when all the cards are stacked against you."

I kept hearing “there’s a snake in my boot” and “that’s all I got to say about that” just my opinion but stick to acting Tom too famous for audibles and I’m so glad Tom and his wife Rita survived this awful pandemic and were so brave and transparent sharing their early diagnosis with the world. Oops sorry I went off topic. Great book, quick read, conjures great emotion, and made me miss and appreciate my own family. "
1938,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8322680-tyler,Rating 3 out of 5,"First Ann Patchett book I’ve ever read. I picked this up after she came to my university and spoke about the book for alumni weekend last fall. Her prose is good but not remarkable, not quite up there with the titans of the English language. It’s an easy, engrossing read, though, for which I was appreciative. The structure reminded me a lot of John Irving, an older narrator looking back on his life, like Owen Meany. At first I thought the sections where he was a young boy sounded unrealistic, but if you understand that he’s an old man writing, looking back, they are more forgivable. I generally liked the book. The strength was the characters, they are all quite complex and it’s interesting to try to judge them, to see if their motives and actions hold up. One of the most interesting things was realizing, as the book went on, that the narrator is not necessarily a great person, even though we’re hearing the story from his point of view. And trying to unravel him and judge him through his words is interesting. Of course, this is just one more demonstration of the outcome of the pain his family inflicted upon them.I thought the third act felt more tedious than the other two, almost directionless. Would have been 4 stars otherwise. Definitely worth a read!"
1939,no user info,Rating 3 out of 5,"Only took me one day to read this book about brother & sister Maeve & Danny. Abandoned by their mother, and left with a distant father who didn't know how to show love or any another emotion but displeasure. The Fathers only true love was the huge Dutch House and he ends up marrying a 2nd time to a women who loves the house and the perceived life that comes with the house. Which has disastrous out comes for everyone.Along with Maeve & Danny the house itself is one of the main characters in the book.About thirty pages into the book I was wondering why did I suggest this book to my book club, it's kind of boring. But slowly something creeps up on you and you start to care about the characters and what is going to happen to them. Each time something happens to either Maeve or Danny and their subsequent reaction to it, you realize how the past has damaged them. Sometimes I found their reactions unbelievable but I am not the writer of this story.All in all I found this to be a good read about people who are broken and how they carry on. And how do you forgive the people who have hurt you the most."

1941,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11812600-kellee,Rating 3 out of 5,"I was intrigued by the story line but it never seemed to get less depressing. I didn’t really understand why Danny would go through med school when he had no desire to be a doctor and knew he wanted to follow in his dad’s footsteps. I didn’t really understand his sister or why her push for him to do more schooling continued to propel him through school. She seemed to have a lot of control of him and yet I don’t feel like we really knew her. It was depressing to find that Danny’s marriage ended in a divorce, the blame being that Maeve had died and she had found it was Danny who annoyed her. I didn’t understand their mom who found it more important to leave her children to help the poor and don’t give a crap about the analogy of her being like a “Saint”. I don’t think anyone who leaves their children should be titled a saint. Andrea was horrid, and I can’t believe she’d kick them out of their own home. If the step-sisters, cared or missed them, why didn’t they reach out? The whole book seemed a bit of a let down and compiled into a lot of depressing events that seemed to perpetuate. And even in the end, Danny seemed so obsessed with Maeve and that his daughter, May, looked so much like her. I think it’s wonderful to have a best friend in a sibling but their relationship was a bit beyond that and seemed to cause problems in the other areas of his life."
1942,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"What a good story that was… there are books that cover a short period of time but explore topics in depth and there are books that go over many years and cover stories of many generations but sometimes they lose meaningfulness and only scratch the surface… The Dutch House covers at least two generations and does it so well. I liked the characters and cared about them, even the house itself seems to be a character in the book. The Dutch House is well written and kept me engaged, I was catching every break in my tight work schedule to read a bit more. I felt especially touched by the portrayal of the siblings Maeve and Danny (who is the narrator), their relationship and love and complexity of navigating their family. It made me think about my brother and how we are now after we lost our parents. Our story is not like that of Maeve and Danny but nevertheless it made me reflect on our relationship. The thing that stayed with me is how much they were attached to the past and how it shaped them as humans… I am looking forward to reading more of Patchett’s books. "
1943,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/134874944-brian,Rating 4 out of 5,"What a delightfully cozy read. The sibling relationship at the core of this book was so tender and pure. I loved how the final third of the novel tied it all together; in the end, everything is okay because why shouldn’t it be. Maeve is my superhero, as are Jocelyn and Sandy.Where this book lost me was the plot and pace. I found the story to be thin at times while overindulging in memories that didn’t really inform the present. A lottttt of details about the house that weren’t particularly thrilling. Because she didn’t take space to dive into big moments that were happening to the people we were rooting for (weddings, deaths, fights, reunions), I didn’t feel as attached to the characters as I wanted to be. The ending was ripe for tears but I wasn’t moved. Also, Danny was kind of incorrigibly selfish? I hated how he talked about his wife (who we didn’t have any sort of investment in, even in the best of times) and how his favorite quality of hers was her submission to his lifestyle. I know it’s rooted in his mommy issues, but cmon. "
1944,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2043963-beth,Rating 5 out of 5,"I jumped into this novel and didn't put it down. I felt completely immersed in the characters' lives and needed to see what happened to them. Patchett's writing style is not complicated, but she does make use of foreshadowing in what I thought was a rather obvious, intentional way. I loved the narrator. It reminded me of To Kill a Mockingbird in that the narrator was reflecting on his life as a now adult. He also lost a parent at a young age. It certainly was a coming-of-age story for Danny (rather like the beloved Scout). Through difficult times, the brother and sister, Danny and Maeve, are there for each other. Their stories made me laugh. The bits about Danny's careers is just hilarious. I loved their adventures and how they helped one another along the way. When I say Patchett's writing is not complicated, I don't mean simple. She has a way of moving a story along for the reader that make the words hold. I'll be thinking about The Dutch House for a long while."
1945,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4658421-peebee,Rating 4 out of 5,"I set the bar very high for Ann Patchett books: she’s one of my favorite authors and some of her past books have blown me away. Her last book, Commonwealth, just didn’t do it for me, however. So while The Dutch House came very highly regarded, and has an astronomically high score on Goodreads, I was still nervous that Patchett would let me down.I would say this book mostly delivers. Sometimes I feel that Patchett is such a skilled writer that when I feel a certain way about a character, that was by design. In other words, that’s a feature and not a bug. I expect I was supposed to consider Cyril an enigma, but I did keep thinking there would be some shocking reveal after his death that never happened. And then when Danny seemed fairly impenetrable emotionally, is that part of his heritage from Cyril and because his mother was absent for his upbringing? Maeve: did she ever have an adult romantic relationship? We see so little of her life, even though she’s central to the book in many ways. I thought Commonwealth was way too long. This book could have explained more, I think. But there are some beautiful insights and wonderful turns of phrase, and I read it quickly because I always enjoy Patchett’s world, whether fiction or nonfiction."
1946,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1338657-mollie,Rating 4 out of 5,"I loved this story about complicated family relationships, loss, and growing up. Young Maeve is one of the best female characters of all time—I love how she took care of her brother and acted the adult when the adults in her life didn’t. I liked her less as the story went on, though—I wanted her to not be stunted, and to find love, and to make a life for herself. I’m happy with how Danny’s life went. Draining the funds for education was hilarious and tragic. I wish he would have put more effort into his own family and a little less into Maeve—her neediness stunted his adult years as well. The mom was a loser for not offering any of herself to her children. I appreciated her lack of enthusiasm for the house, but that shouldn’t have trumped her sense of connection to them. She should have communicated better with her husband. The dad was fine—just needed to talk to the people around him more. I loved that the mom ended up taking care of the stepmom in the end. It seemed like some kind of redemption. I also loved how the whole story spun around that house. Beautifully done as a connecting piece! Such a great story that brought together my hero author and actor with Tom Hanks reading the audible. (I got to meet her a few years ago in her store and the joy brought me to tears. I’m sure the same would be true if I were ever lucky enough to meet Mr Hanks as well!)"
1947,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54892413-erica-sand-between-pages,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5/5.Here's an important thing to note about The Dutch House. I listened to this book - and Tom Hanks is the narrator. This made The Dutch House a significantly better experience for me! Had I bought a physical copy of the book to read, I would have probably regretted the purchase. That sounds harsh, but I think it would have been difficult to get into the story without my pal Tom telling it to me. While I ended up super invested in Maeve and Danny, the storyteller is what invested me..The Dutch House is an interesting story and mainly centers around the relationship between siblings Maeve and Danny. I really loved their relationship, how they supported one another and leaned on each other and were united through an uncharacteristic childhood. .The writing is wonderful - I totally get why Ann Patchett is loved. But I guess I am failing to see what the whole point of the story is? AND WILL SOMEONE TELL ME WHO THE WOMAN ON THE FRONT COVER IS SUPPOSED TO BE???"
1948,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23457420-dan-ries,Rating 4 out of 5,"I couldn’t quite round up to a 5 star on this one but…I am glad I stuck with this book which was feeling like a 2 or 3 star rating. One of my trusted reading friends recommended it so I didn’t think twice about diving in. I found myself a couple of times thinking about giving up on the book - once about 25% through and even once about half way through. I did not have the usual enthusiasm I have for a book I’m reading. I was finding myself doing other things to avoid picking it up. The main reason for this apathy was because I didn’t really connect with any of the characters enough to care what happened to them in the future or to find out what really occurred in the past. But halfway through the book, enter “Fluffy.“ Her character breathed life into the Dutch House. She enlightened some of the main characters in the book - and her character sparked a quest for knowledge in me. Suddenly I could not wait to enter the Dutch House. The time I spent there was time well spent."

There will be colleges essays about what the symbol of the Dutch House stands for, and honestly I would love to read them because I'm still unsure. I enjoyed parts of this book, I think Patchett captures the emotions / memories of certain experiences really well. But a lot of the characters felt like they lacked depth (the motivations for everyone's actions were often unclear) and at the end I just didn't really feel like I knew what I was supposed to get out of it. Glad I read it at the same time as a friend and we got to discuss, though! Highly recommend informal 1:1 / mini virtual book clubs during quarantine!Overall, I preferred State of Wonder and Bel Canto over this one, but there's something about her writing I really like even when the plot doesn't hit, so I will surely read more of her books! "
1950,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1544264-rachel,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is just the kind of story I love: a dysfunctional yet normal and relatable family, examination of the past and how it affects the present, and a house so central to the story that it’s a character itself. I had such a clear mental picture of what the Dutch house looked like. I loved Maeve’s character and her relationship with Danny. My only complaint was that the book was a little slow at times, particularly when Maeve and Danny got to be middle aged. And sometimes it jumped around in time without a lot of warning. But what was really excellent about this book was Tom Hanks’ narration. The cover says “performed by Tom Hanks” which is the best way to describe this. He didn’t read or narrate this; he performed it. His narration is part of why this is five stars. I don’t want to oversell his performance too much, but I think this is the best audiobook I’ve ever listened to. He made even the slow parts sound interesting and even the way he read the chapter headings was unique every time. This book is really good but Tom Hanks makes it amazing. Get it on audio if you can!"
1951,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13417219-emily,Rating 5 out of 5,"I could barely put down this multi-generational story of an extended family and the house that tied them together. Ann Patchett did such a good job of imbuing the Dutch house with as much life as the people that inhabited it over the years. I could see the house, walk through it, feel the sunshine through its windows, in my imagination. That is the mark of good writing.The relationship between Maeve and her younger brother Danny was reminiscent for me, as I am an older sister of a younger brother whose mother left us for a time to pursue career dreams, much as their mother left to help the less fortunate in India. My brother and I lived with our father and stepmother (and one stepsister) during our teenage years, and our relationships with our stepmother were difficult and complex. So, many long-buried emotions came up as I read this, even thought there were many differences between the situations. Ultimately, this novel had much to say about life: the ties that bind us to others and to a place. The emotions that place and home can invoke. Families and step-families and brothers and sisters and parents and aging. Love and anger and indifference. Life and death. Health and lack thereof. How things can change in an instant, and the things that you thought were stable and secure can come tumbling down without warning.Simple and elegant and perfectly drawn. A beautiful book."
1952,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18906322-joanne,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is the first book I've read by Ann Patchett, but I'm going to look for more. The cover repeatedly caught my eye all year on GR, and I'm glad I read it. It's the kind of meaty, multi-generational story that really resonates with me. I found Maeve to be an especially compelling character: strong, tenacious, yet secretly vulnerable and suffering. She is Danny's pillar of strength throughout his life, especially after the awful Andrea moves into their home. Although Danny is the narrator, I found him hard to know, but nonetheless interesting. Did anyone feel that history was repeating itself, with the father and son marrying two women (Andrea and Celeste) who seem very much alike? Most of the time, I don't like books where the author uses the last couple of chapters to wind it up, tie loose ends, etc. But in this case, I liked the way it was done. I needed to know. This was a terrific book."

Every sentence felt very deliberate. The characters fascinated me, including what I'd call the main character (aside from Danny)- the house. I don't need a storyline with a big mystery and grand finale as it's resolved to draw me in, so if you do, you might find this one lacking what you look for. Instead, this book acted more like a mirror into myself, making me question how I'd feel, what would I do? I felt a wide range of emotions from chapter to chapter as the characters grew in age but still felt remarkably the same as their younger selves. The book was painted beautifully, like the portrait of young Maeve on the cover. Well done, Ann Patchett.Note: I alternated reading the book and listening to the audio book on my commutes, and I recommend checking out the audio version of you have trouble getting into it at first. Tom Banks does a perfect job narrating. Loved it!"

Such well rounded, imperfect characters and such a heart-achingly beautiful storyline. I have never cared about so many characters at once while not knowing them fully. The author does a stupendous job of making the House feel like the central marionette. Maeve and Danny's relationship felt so remarkably real. It's a very moving narrative. I loved the portrayal of their attempt and inability to get over their past, of trying to grow distant to the same conversations, same thoughts about the same people in the same place and yet, longing for it all the same when they half-heartedly left it behind.All of this, and yet the ending disappointed me! The story is so good at being imperfect and it changing its course at the end didn't sit too well.But redemption: Tom Hanks does a wonderful job as the narrator of the audiobook! And it's written in a hauntingly memorable way."

However, this seems to be flipped for Ann Patchett's books! 🤷🏻‍♀️This is my third Ann Patchett book. Two were book club picks (fiction), and the other was her non-fiction short story collection I chose for a Kindle challenge. For some reason I loved the non-fiction, and haven't connected with either of her fiction stories. This one was a struggle for me I think because I didn't like any of the characters! 🤦🏻‍♀️ I didn't see the point of the whole story. There was only small bits of redemption for all the fallacies of the characters.It did lead to a lot of discussion at our meeting! That probably added a star for me. If you are an audiobook reader, this one is narrated by Tom Hanks (which she talks about how that came about in These Precious Days), so that was cool! But overall wasn't for me. A lot of others really enjoyed it though, so don't necessarily take my word for it."
1956,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1376410-lisa,Rating 5 out of 5,"Every time I hear about a new Ann Patchett book coming out, I get excited. The Dutch House was well worth the wait. I snagged an ARC of it several months ago, and made myself wait until September to read it. The novel surprised me because I could not predict where the story was going, even though the premise, that Maeve and Danny are kicked out of their childhood home and robbed of their inheritance, is spelled out from the very beginning. The story is believable, the characters are fully formed and flawed, just like normal people, and it was a real page turner.By the end of the book I really wanted to discuss it with someone and think it would make an excellent book club read. I am still pondering the question Maeve and Danny discuss, ""“'Do you think it’s possible to ever see the past as it actually was?"" This is a question that I often ask myself.Thank you to Netgalley and the publisher for a copy of this book. It hasn't changed my view of the book."

When I saw it was narrated by Tom Hanks, I didn’t even hesitate to read what the novel was about. Who cares? That combination would make the Mew York phonebook fascinating. I adored this. Hanks even made the chapter headings and closing credits interesting. And Patchett is at her best here. It’s just a story about a brother and sister. And it’s perfect in every way.From Anne Bogel: I love sibling stories and meaty family sagas, as well as stories told with a reflective, wistful tone. This one delivers on all counts. Cyril Conroy means to surprise his wife with the Dutch House, a grand old mansion outside of Philadelphia. But a symbol of wealth and success for some is a symbol of greed and excess to others—including, crucially, Cyril's wife—and the family falls apart over the purchase. In alternating timelines, we get the whole story, over five decades, from Cyril's son Danny. "

I think every novel I read that I give five stars to is speaking to some kind of deeply held fantasy of mine -- and for me, this is a fantasy about the loving relationship that I hope my kids will have with each other one day. Taking care of each other, long after Tony and I have died. The prose is incredible here. I fully escaped into this melancholy world through it. I listened to this on audiobook and Tom Hanks was a delightful narrator. Even the way he read the chapter numbers was lovely. I also think this book gives me hope in the human ability to soften and become more open to things as I get older. That forgiveness and acceptance are things that ordinary, broken people can give and receive, not just the saints. Please let me know if you read this one because I have a lot of words to say about it."

It spans decades of life for siblings Danny and Maeve, ultimately portraying a brother and sister relationship that becomes their anchor of safety and sometimes their complete undoing. Though some parts were uneventful it did not deter me from the steady journey of this story to its ultimate destination. My first from Patchett but I couldn’t deny the talent in her writing. The Dutch House is the center of the novel, which stands as a pillar of symbolism for greed, familial longing, love, abandonment and seriously becomes a character all on its own. There is so much inescapable grief and sadness for Danny and Maeve as they return to the Dutch House time and time again to sit in its driveway and remanence in the past which ultimately ties them there for a life time. There are characters here that frustrate me (sometimes all of them) and that I don’t agree with but the whole idea of the story makes me think.... which I think in its own right is the purpose of reading a good book. It’s description as a dark fairy tale holds true as this tale is far from a happy one. Nevertheless, this story will give you a conclusion that ultimately comes full circle celebrating family dysfunction at its best. •��**The only way to hear this story is through Tom Hanks narration. He is the voice of Danny through and through.My review hit somewhere between 4-5 stars, and I can’t quite figure that out yet."

State of Wonder and Bel Canto are among my favorite books of all time. I picked this one up in Australia at a book store that was having a buy one get one 50% off sale so I actually own the physical book, which is rare for me lately!The Dutch House is not an exception-is is evocatively written. Emotional and evocative with truly interesting characters. It is the primarily the story of Maeve and Danny Conroy-children who grow up in a stately mansion in a rural Philadelphia suburb. The mansion, dubbed the Dutch House because the initial family that built it were dutch tobacco barons, is at the heart of the family's rise & fall, their turmoil and loss, and ultimately, their reunion and reckoning.I really liked it. I had issues with some of the characters and some of the continuity but all in all-another home run for Ann Patchett. I hope they make this one into a movie. I would love to see how they build The Dutch House into a set!"

To those didn’t care for it, who find the characters unbearably selfish or self absorbed or obsessed with the past - how lucky for you. Some of us can understand the life before, and after, trauma- and the desire to understand how things were and above all where it all went wrong. Some of us can understand the constant inner battle between our need to know and make sense of time and place and what happened, with needing to live and love right now and not be trapped in the past, the exhausting work of getting outside of ourselves again. This work is a masterpiece of these things. It is a character driven study at its best. Some don’t like character driven works, to which I always think why not? Don’t you want to understand yourself, your partners, your parents, your children, or those around you? Anyway. Well done Ms Patchett. And the narration by Tom Hanks is exactly as compelling as you would expect. "

Just when you think the story isn’t getting to you THAT much, a good wrap around ending like that appears and who cares if it’s a little cheesy, it’s exactly how it should have gone and I LOVE a story that centers on a house and this didn’t disappoint. The jumping backwards and forwards in time was great, I love that, and I love that just when you think the house isn’t going to com up again, it appears at the end of the street, waving at you because of course, of COURSE, it is still there, it always has been, waiting for you to come back. I loved the sibling relationship, I loved how real it felt along with both their feelings towards their mother, how DIFFERENT these feelings were. I love how Danny knew his sister best but still didn’t know her completely to know how she would react to their mother. I love how different experiences and memories can develop, after sharing most of the same ones, because of a couple of years difference - a time period where you don’t belong/exist, is a time period you can’t judge, can’t place feelings over or take experience from. Patchett writes this so viscerally, it was amazing. I felt SO much when reading this book. "

To make my wish a rule and abide by is the safest way to reserve the charm, but, in any story, the climax is inevitable. There where the evil spirits bewitched me to break the talisman by reading this book. All in all, the story wears the cloak of our childhood nostalgic classic Cinderella in a modern way, overflowed with a mixture of feelings not easy to process. However, regarding the characters, I’ve never felt mad at a fictional, nonphysical existence, an imagination’s cooked character as I did towards Elna Conroy. For God’s sake, marrying is a commitment, a long life obligation to the husband, the wife, and the children. It’s like break oneself into pieces and share it with the family members. No one builds a family and decides to abandon it because the house is too fancy, or the call of duty forces itself outside the country. these are flimsy excuses for cowards. Maeve says about herself and her brother that they weren’t orphanages; I think they might not be orphanages formally, but they were orphanages heartily."
1964,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2954796-carla,Rating 4 out of 5,"I listened to the audiobook and I kept wondering if I really loved the book or just listening to Tom Hanks. He read it so well. The characters were interesting and despite there being lots, they felt developed and complex to me. Patchett did a fantastic job jumping around the timeline in a way that felt real, as if you were friends with Danny and Maeve slowly learning the story of their lives, piece by piece. And the importance of the Dutch House almost made it a character itself. I enjoyed this much more than Run by Ann Patchett.My favorite quote from the book:“‘The only way to really understand what money means is to have been poor,’ he said to me when we were eating lunch in the car. ‘That’s the strike you have against you. A boy grows up rich like you, never wanting for anything, never being hungry’—he shook his head, as if it had been a disappointing choice I’d made—‘I don’t know how a person overcomes a thing like that.’”(Chapter 2, Pages 19-20)"

Chvíľu mi príbeh rozpráva malý chlapec a o pár viet ďalej už mladý muž.Netreba sa však báť, kniha nie je vôbec chaotická. Ja by som ju skôr nazvala takou skladačkou. Dieliky som dostávala postupne, ale nie zaradom. Musela som si ich v hlave logicky poskladať a jednoducho ""nestratiť niť"".Príbeh zachytáva život dvoch súrodencov, ktorých opustila mama. Danny bol ešte malý, ale Maeve si ju pamätala. Sledovať ich rozdielne vnímanie osoby ich matky bolo veľmi zaujímavé.V podstate celá kniha bola veľkou charakterovou štúdiou, čo ja mám veľmi rada.Nebudem klamať, pre mňa bola kniha trochu zvláštna. Nevedela by som konkrétne povedať, o čom bola, ale príbeh súrodencov vo mne zanechal hlbokú stopu a zmes pocitov.Mnoho vecí ostalo nevypovedaných, otázok nezodpovedaných, no príbeh sa skvelo ukončil a ja som s Maeve a Dannym prežila takmer celý ich život.Kniha sa mi však veľmi páčila. Bola napísaná skvelo, čítala sa ľahko, ale osud postáv bol ťažký.Pokiaľ hľadáte hodnotné čítanie, toto bude to pravé.Myslím, že toto je ten typ knihy, z ktorej si po každom ďalšom prečítaní odnesiete niečo iné..."

I spent my early mornings and late nights indulging in the story around Danny and Maeve. Their relationship captivated me and I was very much moved by the simplicity of the story as it spanned generations of time. It was mundane and heartbreaking. It was human. It captured the little nuances of how we see things as a child and struggle with our past as we age and experience life outside the world in which we once lived. It reminded me that healing often times comes to us in ways we don't expect, healing sometimes doesn't seem to come at all. The work was honestly beautiful and I will think about it for years to come. Maybe I was swooned by Tom's voice or maybe it was the writing. Part of me thinks it was a little of both. I would highly recommend!"

But the trouble neither starts nor ends quite there. Smitten is the word I would use. It completely drew me in, the story is told with so much care and brilliance. Grudges and villains and redemption and spite and family and getting stuck in the past and things unsaid and things undone and not undone, understood and misunderstood, it's a masterful and intricate story.I do agree that some ""fiction"" happens somewhere at the end there, and it could have gone either way, but it never got cheap. The motivations were clear as day even if we disagree. And there were characters without a voice, which I found the most interesting. ***“After years of living in response to the past, we had somehow miraculously become unstuck, moving forward in time”"

I am reflecting now and I don't feel satisfied. Told through the eyes of Danny regarding his childhood and life with the only family he had his older sister Mauve. They'd sit in the car outside the house they were banished from and reminisce. ""But we overlay the present into the past. We look back through the lense of what we know now, so we're not seeing it as the people we were, were seeing as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered."" Pg 45This quote. So that's in a sense what is happening but I wanted to know why they were told to leave thier home by thier step mother. Why she let it go forever. Not a fast moving book but a deep book. Which I normally love but this just didn't give me what I wanted to know so for that 3 stars."
1969,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4807331-jeanie-myfairytalelibrary,Rating 5 out of 5,"With Tom Hanks as a narrator, this is a great story to listen to on audio. The novel is about siblings Maeve and Danny. Their mother deserted them for what she felt were noble reasons and their father remarries a much younger woman (think evil stepmother). When their father passes away, the evil stepmother puts her plan in action to steal everything she can from them. The story follows the siblings and their relationship for five decades. Tom Hanks and Ann Patchett have a lovely friendship and he voiced her words beautifully. I’ve seen reviews that complain about the pacing, but for me this is exactly how family stories are told. This is a book that reminds me why I love to read. If you want to listen to the best of the best, listen to this.

1970,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3868510-jz-nj,Rating 2 out of 5,"Listened to Tom Hanks do an excellent job narrating this meandering mess of siblings, generations of families, and unlikeable characters. The story jumps in time, is it 1950, 1960, back to another era, and the siblings seem to come back to sit in cars in front of The Dutch House, like moths to a magnet, carting their anger, brokenness, and self absorption decade, after decade.The story,shallow and superficial, as the author skimmed the surface , she “told” and didn’t “show” as the saying goes in writing technique. Apparently, Ann Patchett wrote the first completed version of this book, hated it so much she rewrote the entire book. Yeeks, if this is the improved version, glad I didn’t endure the original. I was relieved to hear the last scene of the book, and happily closed the door to The Dutch House, and mentally winterized that mansion! I’m glad to drape cloths over the furniture, to drain all the waterlines, and, disconnect the utilities be done with The Dutch House and it’s inhabitants."
1971,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/863374-rebekah,Rating 4 out of 5,"I couldn’t put this book down. I read it in a day. Okay, Tom Hanks read it in a day while I listened and folded laundry. It’s a pretty simple story about a family and a house and the sweet relationship of a brother and sister navigating a world that isn’t always kind to them. I liked both Danny and Maeve as characters and loved how they always had each other’s backs. I was a little frustrated by how much the time period repeatedly held Maeve back, but admired her ability to find contentment and pleasure in a simple and productive life—except when it came to the will—then she was a little vindictive.🙃When I was young, my parents bought a large Victorian-style home from the elderly man whose father had built it almost one hundred years before. It had lots of charm and maybe a few ghosts of the original family, so reading the descriptions of the Dutch house made me a little nostalgic for my childhood home, though we never had nannies or house staff!! I always enjoy when houses are basically considered a character in a book because that’s how my home felt to me as a child."
1972,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11799899-kristen-howell,Rating 5 out of 5,"Family and Tom HanksI’m not sure this book would be for everyone but I absolutely loved it! It is a slow burn and you’re never totally sure where the story is going to go. There is also no huge climatic ending. However, I am a huge fan of family sagas and this one was perfect. I loved Danny (possibly because he narrated the story and I switched back and forth between reading and Audible and Danny was TOM HANKS). I also loved the relationship between Danny and Maeve and can only hope my own children would cling to eachother this tightly in good and bad. If you are a fan of Ann Patchett’s writing and enjoy stories of family, faith and forgiveness then I highly recommend this book."
1973,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31228627-sandra-payne,Rating 5 out of 5,"“ I had not been born with an imagination large enough to encompass this moment”. I love this writer. I just struggled thru several books that thought they were all that and a bag of chips but Ann Patchett is the real deal. She sucks you in with her character development and you feel every emotion and thought with them. In this book she has created a character who has her eyes set on the man she plans to marry. She is not the main character and a great author can get you involved with a minor player. I really believe the author sat down with me, got into my headspace and created this character. Everyone is realistic and believable. The ending??? Perfection. Nothing flashy, not supernatural, no bloody mysteries in the story. Just generational storytelling and after you finish you immediately find another one of her books. Mine will the The Magicians assistant."
1974,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7169135-susan,Rating 4 out of 5,"Very well told story of how we negotiate our lives with our history. Ann Patchett conjures an almost magical world of good and evil and then washes the lines with an impression of wisdom. The characters grow and develop in a bumpy rhythm that slips them back to the past without warning, then returns them to a new present, maturing into themselves while still recognizable as the children they once were. In Commonwealth, Patchett was dazzling at revealing the adult versions of the children we knew first, whereas in the Dutch House, the growth is more subtle, yet still authentic. The story is so fantastic as to be somewhat distancing, but as a slightly skewed fairy tale, it reads as a satisfying and entertaining adventure."

Her writing preys on the weakness we were either hiding or wasn’t even aware of. It goes without saying that she will always receive a full mark in my books. Always. Patchett throws light at imperfections and dysfunctional families. It’s not unusual to have stepmothers and stepsisters these days. However upon mention of these words, we go back to scrubbing cinders and glass slippers. In reality though, it’s an adversity that equals pain, unusual obstacles that you go in blind because no one really talks about it.

1976,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"Five stars and on my Best of 2019 list for sure!The Dutch House by Ann Patchett is amazing, but the audio version narrated by Tom Hanks? It's the perfect pair. I devoured this book, so completely engaged in the story.This family saga is narrated through the eyes of Danny-just three years old when his mother leaves. It is a very loose retelling of Hansel and Gretel complete with a pair of siblings, an evil step mother and the dream house. The family lives in a mansion, locally well known that serves as a status symbol and a means to unravel how their lives unfold. Ultimately it's a story of love, loss and forgiveness. I was very moved by Danny's story. It felt incredibly intimate and poignant and reads like a memoir.I so loved this book and highly recommend it."
1977,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12430567-jill-bowman,Rating 5 out of 5,"Extra special 5 ⭐️ because of Tom Hanks reading of the audiobook. I really felt like he was telling me the story. In a nutshell the story of 2 orphans, a wicked stepmother, young but decent stepsisters, 2 fairy Godmothers, and a fantastic, unchanging house to tie it all together. And so much more. The sibling friendship between Danny and Maeve was lovely, unending, and possibly just a little obsessive. I enjoyed their interactions over the years. The same can’t be said for Andrea, the manipulative cow...It took a bit to read this because I haven’t been in the car very often to listen to it... so this morning I woke up at 4 (no alarm, just awake) and climbed out of bed to sneak off into another room and listen all by myself to the last hour. Yup, worth it!!!"
1978,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5255163-rosemarie-donzanti,Rating 4 out of 5,"So what exactly happened in the Dutch house?...two kids abandoned by their Mother, a Father who ignores them and leaves them all but penniless, a step Mother who is unconscionable in her choices and actions, and a Nanny who is more interested in sleeping with their Dad than caring for them. An unconventional family when unconventional was actually unconventional. The “adults” create a very unstable environment aka a very unstable home, The Dutch House. The house represents choices made by all representing each’s own best interest. Selfish choices that bind the siblings to a dysfunctional past, yet their deep love for each other keeps them sane and moving positively into the future. A lot of symbolism in the book for sure. Many hopeless relationships that actually heal. Maeve had my heart through the whole book. Her unselfish care for her brother and her acceptance of her step sisters and those who wronged her speaks volumes about her character. She created a loving home and family for anyone who needed acceptance. So it is not the house that makes a home, but a heart that makes a home. The fact that the house is based just outside of Philadelphia was a real perk for me. “We had made a fetish out of our misfortune, fallen in love with it. I was sickened to realize we’d kept it going for so long, not that we had decided to stop.” ― Ann Patchett, The Dutch House"
1979,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5912889-catherine-woodman,Rating 5 out of 5,"I love this author. The first book I read, Bel Canto, which garnered a lot of praise but I did not much like. I worked beyond that, read The Magician's Assistant, and earlier work, and loved it. The rest is history.I loved this book. It is a tale oft told, where the father remarries a younger woman, and unlike his first wife, who married him when he was poor, this woman is definitely attracted as much to his house and his money as to he himself. She more or less shuns his children when he is alive, something he would have noticed if he wasn't so focused on staying away from wife number two. In any case, his sudden death changes their lives. The book loops around in classic Patchett fashion to close quite a few circles. It has a perspective on love and loss, anger and forgiveness, family and connections, all of it believable and warm to behold. It is not so much a tragedy as a family journey, with all the elements of what that entails. Maybe my favorite of her books."

This was not on my radar at all, though I now see that 2 friends have marked it as to-read, and was dropped off to me on a lark. I loved it! Danny narrates his life story, as he and his older sister Maeve grow up in wealth and luxury in the area's most unique house, face their mother's leaving at a young age (Maeve then becomes Danny's guiding light), bond with the servants, vie for their father's love and attention, endure a new stepmother, the death of their father a few years later, and are then kicked out by the stepmom. Maeve and Danny have an extraordinary relationship, codependent and entwined, Danny marries and starts a family, but Maeve is unable to move on from the circumstances of her upbringing. Set largely in Philidelphia and NYC, this was an incredibly engrossing character story."

At its heart this is a family saga and the story of two siblings who's lives are forever altered when their mother leaves their family home to embark on community services work in India and their father moves on with another woman, bringing her into their home.When I read a family saga I need to be emotionally moved. I need to have feelings evoked in me that will make me care about the characters and their stories. In this case I didn't and that is why I didn't enjoy this as much as I hoped.Out of the two siblings, Danny and Maeve, Danny narrated the novel and I did not find his story to be interesting or compelling in the slightest. For me Maeve was my main point of fascination. Ultimately though I did not find interest in the characters in generalI would have liked to have known more about the step mother's story but she was only ever given a lens from the perspective of the siblings and this was as a wicked step mother. This felt too one-sided.I will say, I enjoyed the descriptions of the house. It felt like a character in its own right and seemed quite beautiful. It conjured up lots of gorgeous imagery. Overall I enjoyed Ann Patchett's writing style but my disinterest in the family and their stories was far too great to rate this higher."
1982,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7746012-ling,Rating 3 out of 5,"This book is more about character development than plot driven, so may not be gripping enough for some readers. It is a ""family saga"" plus historical fiction, though much heavier on the family aspect as it focuses on the relationship between siblings Maeve and Danny. Theirs is the kind I wish I had with my own brother, although it was often a bit too close where it alienated others in their lives. I loved reading about the house, which was a character of its own; and being familiar with Philadelphia and New York, enjoyed reading the descriptions of the train or car rides between the cities and of the geographies themselves. A slower pace than the last book I read which was a page turner, so it's a bit hard to separate from that - overall a 3.5 rating. "
1983,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69961452-cassandra-l-manna,Rating 4 out of 5,"A modern-day story of love, too much love, and a frustrating lack of communication, that reads like a fairytale. It was beautifully written, as if it was part of an oral tradition, told late at night over the fire, as a warning to the young and a reminder to the old: love so you can live and speak that love so you can move forward.Rate Procedure:⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ - I loved the book so much I would reread it again and would recommended to a friend.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ - Thoroughly enjoyed the book, could not do put it add down, would recommending to a friend, but do not need to read again.⭐️⭐️⭐️ - Probably a good book that I enjoyed but there was something about it I did not love (e.g. The writing style, the POV, etc.). I would only recommend to a friend if it was their ""type"" of book.⭐️⭐️ - A book I have below average feelings for and it would not come with a recommendation from me but I would mention it in conversation if related to the book topic at issue.⭐️ - I finished the book but I hated every second of it."

A love letter to Victorian-era stories that aren’t being written anymore.

The author’s writing was great—funny and insightful, with a wonderful use of analogies and metaphors, but throughout it, somehow the overall storyline wasn’t satisfying to me. Some of the great passages, both epic and humorous, without spoilers, are:“There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you’ve been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet in place, and for a moment you’re suspended, knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself.”“The dinner was a huge production, with kids stashed in the den to eat off card tables like a collection of understudies who dreamed of one day breaking into the dining room.”"

Despite of the grandeur looking building with three floors and expensive furnishings, the house had shifted the fate of their family. After their mother's runaway to India, Maeve & Danny's lives weren't the same anymore, especially after their dad starting seeing Andrea, their future stepmother.The story goes along Danny's life, after being repelled out of The Dutch House, and how he still clings to his father's job despite the loss of his father due to a heart attack. 4.3 stars"

I definitely felt like the last 50 pages were a bit rushed compared to the pace of the majority of the book, but overall the writing style and pace was really enjoyable. I’ve read a few reviews that think the narrator, Danny, was annoying, and I could not disagree more. To me, Danny was one of the best parts of the story. The relationship between him and his sister, Maeve, was also so compelling. There were definitely some moments that I would have liked to have elaborated on, or given more care to, but overall, this is a really strong book that caught my attention fast and held onto it the entire time.

The fact that it is under 400 pages and somehow so rich and beautifully developed is a mystery to me— I feel like I lived an entire lifetime in these pages. I love how The Dutch House primarily centers a non romantic relationship to drive the plot. Like Donna Tart’s, Goldfinch, the cast is unable to escape an inanimate grasp, the shadow of their childhood home, as if it has come alive to chase after them through the course of their lives.This book absolutely shredded my heart, dealing with regret, abandonment, forgiveness, and sibling devotion with such perfect subtlety. I will never forget this book. I can’t overstate how much I love it and how seriously I think everyone should read it."
1990,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/93678870-julie-fenske,Rating 5 out of 5,"I’m always a sucker for stories about siblings and dysfunctional families and the inner workings of what seems to outsiders like the most insular and inscrutable of situations. Nothing gives me quite the same feeling as being allowed into those inner workings, and The Dutch House is all of that, plus a house that is a character, that seems to play God in a sense to Maeve and Danny. Ann Patchett’s configurations of these characters seem to reflect back to the reader a sense of where they themselves are at in terms of their own relationships – if you side with Maeve or Danny or their mother or Celeste or any number of characters, and why. I got off to a slow start but I couldn’t put this book down today. "
1991,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59028209-madeline,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book is beautiful and represents so much through the world built around one family that really represents us all. A heartaching glimpse into the lives that look polished on the outside, but are crumbling behind the varnish. But it’s also about family: blood and chosen alike. It’s about forgiveness and healing. It’s about dreams and what might happen if they’re not followed. It’s about siblings and the love that prevails for them. It’s about grief and finding glimpses of those who are no longer there in the aftermath. I loved it, but I will say that I think a major reason I loved it so much was because Tom Hanks narrated it and gave it a life and meaning through his narration that I probably would not have been able to get from reading it on my own, that’s the only reason it’s not a 5 star read! "
1992,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5685564-marcy,Rating 4 out of 5,"It’s always a pleasure to read the writing of Ann Patchett. In this case it was her thoughtful writing and the relationships she builds between her well developed characters that kept me interested. The emotional holds of the past determined the futures of most of the players, especially Danny and Maeve, around which the story revolves. Also the awareness that our memory of the past isn’t always the reality of the past is a recurring theme. That being said, I found the book to be uneven in parts. The beginning was promising, the middle dragged a bit, and the ending picked up, but I’m not sure I fully believed it. All in all, a good read."

I think it's a wonderful family saga (can it be a saga with only three generations?) in the print version, but I'm sure my delight was heightened by Hanks' lovely reading. I even loved his chapter announcements; CHap-Ter THREE!!! In terms of plot, not much exciting happens: a family breaks apart, reconfigures, breaks again, and the individuals grow through the years, all within and around a massive, beautiful hulk of a house. But that's all we need for a story, right? People whose lives intertwine, stretch and grow. I believe so, as long as it's beautifully told, and this one sure is."

This book broke my heart a little bit.While this isn’t the most action-packed story, it still gut-punched me. It’s beautiful...about a family holding on to the past, resentment and forgiving those who have hurt us.I can’t say I liked all the characters or agree with what happened (sometimes it was infuriating) but something about it felt close to me...a brother and sister, a house that held so many memories, characters that couldn’t let go.I loved Maeve and how much she and her brother loved each other.This feels like the kind of story that will stay with me.Also, Tom Hanks narrated the audiobook & it was fantastic!

Patchett’s gorgeous words and emotional tale is one that is enhanced by the storytelling skills of Hanks. What I think would have been a 4 or 4.5 star read jumped to a 5 because of the narration. It’s the perfect pairing.The story itself is one that honestly I knew almost nothing about going in and I recommend keeping it that way. The house is an important character in this story of family dysfunction and you won’t regret listening.This is one for those who love beautiful language, complicated and realistic stories and for those who love audiobooks or who are thinking about trying out their first one."
1996,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1135467-featherbooks,Rating 3 out of 5,"Hmmm several of my fav readers adored this novel so I'm in the minority in my lackadaisical response. Was it the house as a character, the nonexistent parental affections, or just uninteresting characters? Danny bored me with his indecision and failure to assert his passions. I might have preferred a book featuring Fluffy's story.Tempted to give up midway, I continued because of Dani's review, and the suspense did pick up a bit with Maeve's illness. On the whole I found it mundane and ordinary without a treasured sentence for my commonplace collection. I prefer Patchett's nonfiction or the exotic settings and unique characters of her earlier novels."
1997,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/863024-barbara-bryan,Rating 4 out of 5,"Really enjoyed this engaging and at times riveting story of siblings Maeve and Danny and The Dutch House where they lived and then didn’t live. I would have preferred to get to know their Mom better; I didn’t get a good feel for her life story or motivations; not in leaving but in staying away. I never warmed to Danny ‘s wife Celeste and wished for more joy in the lives of the two siblings. The writing is pure Patchett and the story pulled you in and carried you along. No intricate plot but rather a slow character driven immersion. “ I always imagined the house would die without us. I don’t know, I thought it would crumple up. Do houses ever die of grief?”“Only the decent ones.”"

I listened to the audio version with Tom Hanks reading it and I’m not sure if it was the story that was spectacular, Tom Hanks reading which didn’t feel like reading but rather an oral rendition of his own life, or a combination of the two. There were dissenting opinions at book group about The Dutch House. Some felt as though the characters weren’t developed enough. Or that the story wasn’t going anywhere. I loved it. I loved the sibling relationship. I loved listening to Danny and Maeve talk about the past and figure out what that meant for each of them. I highly recommend The Dutch House. If you are in a book group it will give you so much to talk about. "
1999,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14056324-sam,Rating 5 out of 5,"My first Patchett and I'm full blown in love. Sometimes you read books and it feels like you've found an old friend, even if you've never read the book or author before. That is how The Dutch House felt for me. There is really no plot, no twists, turns, or surprises. It is, however, a beautifully heartbreaking portrait of a family. We follow this family for 50+ years and we jump back to the past, forward to the future, and sometimes we really sink our teeth into the present. The house is a character in itself and when I think back on the story as a whole, the house places itself centrally in my mind with strings connected to each and every character we meet. It is quiet and sad and nostalgic and I would be perfectly happy following these characters forever."
2000,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64130107-tom-demarco,Rating 4 out of 5,"I'm beginning to think that all Ann Patchett novels have the same theme: forgiveness. It's a crafty choice -- if indeed that is what she's chosen -- because in order to write about forgiveness, there has to be something to forgive. And it ought to be something pretty near unforgivable, otherwise forgiveness can be too casually given.In The Dutch House, what needs to be forgiven is a betrayal by an adult of two children. It's not a bad turn, not a nastiness, but an honest-to-god betrayal. And they're just kids. When the betrayal is done, it doesn't just go away; the children are scarred with it for the rest of their lives. And yet they forgive.You get so engaged (she is a masterful writer) that before the end you're almost ready to forgive the betrayer yourself. Almost, but not quite. By chance I'v been reading The Dutch House in the daytime and C.P. Snow’s Time of Hope (part of the Strangers and Brothers series) when I crawl into bed at night. I certainly didn’t think of this when I started either one, but they are eerily similar stories: adolescent male narrator, mother’s nervous breakdown, useless father, grim poverty after relative prosperity.Because they’re so alike, the contrasts in approach might give a clue to how the art of the novel has changed between Snow’s 1949 and Patchett’s 2019. Or maybe not; maybe it’s just the difference in style between two very different authors.Still, I suspect that an exchange such as the following from Dutch House, simply couldn’t have been written by Snow or anyone else in the 1940s: Sandy asked me if I’d brushed my teeth, by which she meant had I brushed them that morning. No one brushed their teeth at four o’clock in the afternoon.  “I did,” I said, because I probably had. For Snow that would have been a distraction: What could the narrator’s teeth possibly have to do with the story that needed to be told? But then Snow was a deadly serious writer. Could Waugh or Amis or Thurber have written those lines? I wonder. They seem to me to be a product of our very present age. What do you think?"
2001,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20712926-gelisvb,Rating 4 out of 5,"Oh, I really liked this.I had zero expectations and really did not want to read this and would have not read it had it not been on the longlist for the women prize for fiction.So it was a unexpected surprise that everything this book does, it does it very well.The audiobook is narrated by Tom Hanks and it has just the right pacing.It took me a month (but not because of the length) to read but it was worth the experience, I had all the time to grow attached to all the characters. I read that this is like a modern fairytale, but I would not agree with that. Of all the books I read in the past few months, it is the one that made me feel more.I loved the ending."
2002,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/288885-maggie,Rating 5 out of 5,"There was something so oddly familiar about this book; I fell right in and stayed up way too late several nights in a row. Beautifully written, with fully fleshed out characters and minutely described settings -though interestingly, I don't have a picture in my head of the house, The Dutch House. When the family made a trip to the NYCB Nutcracker, and they described the first act house set as being like the Dutch House, I was flabbergasted - 'cause I know that set oh so well, and that's not AT ALL how I envisioned the house. Captivating book. I've put it aside because I will want to re-read it one day. "
2003,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6657618-jenny,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is a quiet novel about a dysfunctional family, obsession with a childhood home, and ultimately about forgiveness. The story is slow moving and character driven. The characters are complex and imperfect and relatable. The timeline is non-linear, and follows Danny back and forth as he recalls his childhood with his sister Maeve in the Dutch House. This book made me sad and hopeful and angry and frustrated and sad again and hopeful again. I felt all the things while reading it, which is exactly what I want from a book. Tom Hank expertly narrates the audio, which I recommend to anyone thinking of reading this book.Trigger warnings: Abandonment, death of a loved one. "
2004,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68909573-kristin,Rating 5 out of 5,"This was so, SO good. Having enjoyed (though not loved) Commonwealth, I was prepared to do the same for The Dutch House, and though the writing is so distinctly Patchett in both novels, I felt the latter did a better job developing fewer characters and had a more believable (still interesting) plot. I liked how Danny narrated, because this easily could have been told by Maeve, and how he wasn't sentimental or overly emotional (which is something I am coming to expect and enjoy from Patchett's style). This really felt like one of those stories you hear someone talk about that's just believable enough to be true but also just intriguing enough to be extraordinary."
2005,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5638065-clarissa,Rating 5 out of 5,"UMMMMMM. Yeah, I loved this one. Like, really loved it. And I'll be the first to admit: this might be thanks to the freakin' amazing narration provided by Tom Hanks himself. But the story--well, honestly it hit me right in my feels. So, if you want a power combo of Tom Hanks and this gorgeous ramble of a story about family, relationships, and the ties that bind--look no further.I loved this book for all the emotions it stirred in me. I felt a part of this story as completely as if I had been Danny himself: his love for his sister--the anger, guilt, confusion and joy all present within his family and the happenings between them all--even the every day moments that make life what it is. This is not really a book with a drive, you know? One that lays out 'here's what's going to happen' or 'here's the path we are going to follow along methodically, from A->B.' This is all the connections, the moments, the wanderings of a normal family through time. The fractures. The unbreakable bonds. The betrayals, and sometimes even the forgiving.I LOVED IT. I also never knew I could feel myself holding a grudge against fictional characters before, but I totally did here. And... yeah, the ending felt as sweet as a song. Do yourself a favour ladies and gents. Let yourself be enveloped in a big Tom Hanks hug. Who could honestly turn that down??"
2006,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47173951-darcy-tanner,Rating 5 out of 5,"4.5 stars. It took me a while to read The Dutch House. And it’s not because I didn’t like it obviously. I’m just always reading multiple books at a time and I let the ones that aren’t grabbing me as much get pushed to the side. And usually when I let a book get pushed to the side it’s because it’s not very good. That wasn’t the case here. No, The Dutch House wasn’t a book I couldn’t put down. But whenever I did pick it up I could get right back into it. Patchett is so good with her characters so I got to know them early on and could easily pick up the story even when I had left it for a while. And even though I wasn’t rooting for a certain ending, or wasn’t sure I knew what I wanted to happen, I know that if the end had been different I don’t think I would’ve liked the story as much. Sorry if they didn’t make sense. It’s a good book so you should read it. "
2007,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7456632-leigh,Rating 3 out of 5,"My reaction to this book is one of those things I didn't expect. It's lovely writing. The characters work. But the content and topic was too close to me and therefore I didn't like it. I didn't want to be soaked in nostalgia, and the end of the book just left me sad and hopeless about how we move on from the things that hurt us in life.I try to read books knowing very little about them, so I can read as a blank slate. In this case, the fact that ""Bel Canto"" is in my top five loved books made that hard to do. I wanted to love it, but I didn't. In this case, it's a matter of how I read and what I expected and less to do with the book itself."
2008,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/112364160-landers,Rating 4 out of 5,"To be honest, I didn't think I would find this book to be as captivating as it was so I was pretty surprised when I finished it in half a day and could not go to sleep until reaching the end of this epic-like novel. The book focuses on a dysfunctional family, specifically revolving around the relationship between the narrator, Danny, and his sister, Maeve. In a fairy-tale way told in the contemporary, there is most definitely an evil stepmother and other obstacles the siblings must face, which only strengthens their bond. This is an endearing story that will make you ponder about your relationship with your own family members and it was a delight to read."
2009,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50878171-marley-richmond,Rating 4 out of 5,"To begin: thank you, Tom Hanks, for narrating this book. This was a very nice listening experience. ""The Dutch House"" tells the story of Danny and Maeve Conroy as they confront their childhood for decades after they've grown out of it. The dutch house itself serves as an icon of a troubled family, one in which loyalty was not determined by blood or marriage but rather by love and presence. The house is a homing beacon to which the Conroy siblings return throughout their lives, as much a character in this novel as the richly developed people who live there. The plot of ""The Dutch House"" is meandering in the best way, lazily circling back through time and jumping forward with surprising twists and turns. This story explores identity as both an individual choice and an effect of one's circumstances; it shows what happens when we hold onto the past and asks when to let go."
2010,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6769012-melanie,Rating 3 out of 5,"I'm not sure whether to give this 3 or 4 stars. It wasn't a bad story, but there were a lot of anti-climaxes and I really just couldn't care about the characters. I don't understand people who don't communicate and then complain about how terrible things are, because they never communicated. Who buys a house for their wife without telling her and then is upset when she's upset? Etc.It might be that the narrator was entirely emotionally empty, but I was not really that invested in the story at all. Not when the dad married the second wife, not when she kicked the kids out, not when anyone got sick or died or had relationship struggles, and not even much at the end. "
2011,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/131780133-lauren-mcnamara,Rating 5 out of 5,"Flossy, our local independent bookshop owner in Knoxville, handed me “The Dutch House” as a follow up to “Where The Crawdads Sing” by Delia Owens. Little did she know, I grew up in these towns - Elkins Park, Jenkintown. The familiarity of Patchett’s setting was so enjoyable for me. I basked in the call outs to the very real local places like Immaculate Conception and Bishop McDevitt - the high school where my parents met and fell in love. This story is a heart-wrenching Bildungsroman that explores the complicated nature of family dynamics, while also persisting the adage, “you reap what you sow”. I loved reading it and I felt a kinship with Maeve and Danny - maybe because I’m a Philly Irish Catholic too, or maybe because I easily pictured myself in the backseat of their many visits to the Dutch House. I find myself recommending it excessively but it was really that good. I wish I could read it again for the first time. Not knowing what will happen to this endearing brother and sister duo keeps you engaged throughout the novel."
2012,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/86592306-danielle-f,Rating 4 out of 5,"Enjoyed this. I'm a person who loves thinking about old homes and who lived in them, and this is one family's story told through their majestic dwelling, The Dutch House, a site of pleasure and pain, happiness and sorrow. I enjoyed the threads of religion, family, shared trauma and redemption throughout. For me, I was intrigued by the subtle way the author reminds us how women and men are treated differently for our social and career aspirations. For a story that time-jumps frequently, we see that many of the women are treated unfairly or feel trapped by their circumstances, and yet they are the caretakers and the keepers of secrets. Also enjoyed the portrayal of ""new money"" and the quest for the trappings of wealth, as well as those who turn away from material things. "
2013,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19413913-hayley,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5? I did enjoy this book…. But I think Tom Hanks helped a lot with that. We are told about everything that happened from Danny’s point of view and I never felt any connection to any of the characters. There were some parts of the plot which I felt were pretty unbelievable, but were necessary to move the story on. No provisions made for the two children? No will? From a man who was fastidious enough to send a lawyer down to the port to meet his estranged wife with divorce papers? Who had expressed his intention for his son to take over the business? Started strong, but by the time the sainted mother returns I was rolling my eyes a bit and, I confess, I speeded Tom’s reading up!That all sounds like I didn’t enjoy the book… but I did. I would happily read more by the author. And I’d recommend the book without opinion, just a ‘let me know what you think’! "
2014,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/93045815-chelsea-and,Rating 2 out of 5,"This book to me wasn’t something I would read normally, it was a book club book for us this month. I wasn’t thrilled with it but it has a nice ending but so many extra details that were not needed and overly drug out really. The main point of the book was the house and to me a big portion had nothing to do with the house but about the son’s life. My favorite part was the ending. My least favorite part was the sister dying. My favorite character was May and least favorite character would be Andrea and the mom(Danny and Maves mom). I personally wouldn’t say I even liked this book but it was not awful. "
2015,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69581772-andra,Rating 3 out of 5,"(Audio) Objectively, this was a really good book. Extremely well written with solid, believable characters. It's well paced and the plot is interesting. Even though I don't read a lot of fiction of this genre, I enjoyed this and always wanted to know what's going to happen next. Like life, it was sad and sweet, cruel and kind, but it never became too much of any of that. It kind of balanced itself out, seemingly wanting to reassure the reader that what happened, happened, and that life goes on. Forgiveness was a prevalent theme, and family, and I liked how the novel addressed both of these things - with a soft, graceful touch. 3.5/5"

2017,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/143897579-anneli,Rating 4 out of 5,"A story of siblings, told by the young brother, of their a deep connection to a house they lived in as children and the why they have such a love hate relationship to it - I really resonated with the siblings bond, which seems to be forged from their need to give each other the love and support they weren’t getting from their parents. The house I feel is written in a way it becomes a character in the story too - one which is intended for either good or bad reasons to make you feel uncomfortable or on edge. I found the ending was satisfyingly “full circle” - perhaps a classic (clichéd) Hollywood happy ending but I was glad for it. "
2018,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23506337-kathleen-witte,Rating 2 out of 5,"I am very sorry to everyone who loves this book because I know it’s like, a modern American classic, and I respect those opinions…but this might have been the most boring and pointless novel I have struggled through in a long time. I was unsure if it was ever going to end. I was unsure if it was ever going to have a point. While it did (eventually) stop torturing me with bland sentences and unlikeable characters, this novel indeed did not ever have a point. I don’t even know what to write as a summary. Two children are essentially orphaned and their ~evil stepmother~ throws them out. But don’t let that fairytale term fool you: this book consists entirely of PUNISHING REALISM. You will be given no fascinating plot! no beautiful language! no surprises! nothing to enjoy about this read! And I assume the “Dutch House” itself is supposed to represent something in this novel than spans one man’s (basic AF) life, but I don’t think Patchett gives the reader nearly enough to go on there. Please please change my mind. I mean it. Tell me why this book is beloved!!! Save me from never trying Patchett again!"
2019,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6938526-emily-crall,Rating 5 out of 5,"I absolutely loved this book! Maybe it’s because I read Verity (mystery thriller; not my usual genre) before this and a whole slew of summer romance books (light, easy) before that, but the storyline was both beautiful and rich without feeling heavy, almost as if there’s no climax…just wonderfully written moments piled upon beautifully described moments. It spans so many decades, but never feels confusing or boring or long. Every moment feels necessary even while being unnecessary, little pieces of life in great, wonderful description.To note, the audiobook is a must for this. Tom Hanks reads it and he brought the people to life in the best ways. I don’t know if I would’ve loved this book as much without his voice."
2020,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1882126-nancy,Rating 5 out of 5,"One of the absolute best books I've read in a long time. What glorious writing with clear insights into the human spirit. I’m sure the relevance of a book has much to do with how relatable the story is. There is so much about this that mirrors points in my life. I wept at the end, the difficult to breathe kind of tears. The weight of place and relationships are the most profound part of the novel, made more poignant by Tom Hanks narration. I have the paperback and after reading rave reviews, purchased the audible version. The inflections and timing of Hanks' interpretation are fabulous. He becomes the characters on every level. I felt I knew all of these people and didn’t want it to end. I won’t address why this is close to home, but know that the course of bitterness and loss that end in a measure of reconciliation and forgiveness are palpable and strong. "
2021,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2887661-cheryl,Rating 4 out of 5,"A charming story about family life. The good and the bad. The POV is from Danny, the son. The brother. The father. His relationship with his older sister - torn between his love for her and his love for his wife and family. The expectation that he will do what she tells him to do over his own desires. The idea that we seldom know our parents as people. Only through our own lense as our parents. Our ties to our childhood pain. How we hold on to it and how we let it go. The house. The house brings them together. And the house tears them apart. And then.... The more I listened to the story, the more connected to it I felt.Excellent (really excellent!) narration by Tom Hanks."
2022,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/94046398-carly-gilson,Rating 4 out of 5,"The protagonist of this book is… a house? Although this novel is not the first to use that motif, I think it’s one of the best to do so. I really enjoyed the audio book with Tom Hanks narration, which I think made me like it more than I would have if I had only read it. This is a simple story very well told. Just like its eponymous house, it is a story with many cracked walls and unexplored rooms. I wish it would have explored multiple narrators rather than just Danny’s story. But overall, I love how it shows just how complicated families can be… and how we must choose how much of ourselves we can truly give to the people we love. "
2023,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5080669-devyn,Rating 4 out of 5,"I can’t resist a beautiful and gorgeous multi generational tale! The writing was simple and clear and layered in the best way. I often don’t read books with male main characters but Danny was a joy to get to know. His passion for handiwork and buildings, his love and loyalty to his sister, his simplicity in choosing his life and accepting where it led. He was real. I adored May as the sort of extension of all of Maeve’s unfulfilled potential and dreams. And too the quiet devotion of Mr. Otto that was constant throughout the book. Maeve never married but there was never a question that she was loved Lessons: Sometimes places become a part of us. Growing up is realizing that your parents are people and flawed and you can hate them until you can’t anymore. Forgiveness is often less about what the other person deserves or being a bigger person and comes down to giving yourself the energy and space to feel something different. "

This was the feeling I had the entire time I read this wonderful and emotionally charged novel by Ann Patchett. When I read the last lines I knew that I was going to miss the friends I met within the pages. I especially bonded with Maeve as we shared the same “affliction”.

A lifelong obsession with the house they lost impacts on their careers and relationships. It's written as a kind of memoir by Danny as he recounts his childhood and what happened after he and Maeve were kicked out of their home. It's a story of siblings, families and what makes home.

Danny and Maeve grew up in a glass-walled mansion, The Dutch House, only to be pushed to the margins and then cast out through the intervention of their stepmother. Over the ensuing decades, they return time and again to park outside and wonder how their lives might have been different had this not occurred. It's a good multiyear tale of family dynamics and interactions (albeit a quite privileged family - this is what I think of as a New York Times book in that sense). The only Patchett I had read previously was ""State of Wonder,"" which I hadn't cared for all that much, but after this pick-up from the airport bookshop I think I'll look for more by her. "

The incredible relationship between brother and sister that unfolded with each page made me long for an analogous sibling companion of my own. With an outstanding audio narration performed by Tom Hanks, The Dutch House left little to be desired other than more chapters! 4.5 stars "

If a house can be a character in a book, then such is the case with The Dutch House. The lives of the house are as important to the story as the lives of the characters. I was instantly pulled in by Danny’s honesty (which I will confess I will always associate with Tom Hanks’ wonderful narration in the audiobook.) This is a story of forgiveness and at various times it has me wondering what level of forgiveness I am capable of and how I better start figuring it out before it’s too late. I didn’t want to leave these characters and I don’t think you can ask for much more than that. "
2029,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"Love the writing style (finally a book that can move around in time seamlessly!) and Patchett's description of places (especially the house) make it so vivid for the reader. However my understanding of the characters and the story bogged down. Many reviews say it is about forgiveness, but I see it as being a story about abandonment and what that does to a person. In any case, I don't get why Elna acted as she did and find no justification for it. Likewise for Andrea. Why didn't they just sell the damn house? Or, at least, buy a second one that Elna felt comfortable in? Wouldn't that have solved everything?? 3.5 stars"

I have to be honest and say that is the main driving factor to why I chose it. I really enjoyed it though! Ending wasn’t my favorite - but the story line sucked me in. As someone that had a bit of a chaotic childhood - this is a book that explores how important family and the deep relationships you make are. Similar to Crawdads in the pace - but Very powerful storyline. Do the audio version if you can - love me some Tom Hanks!! I’d say it’s like a 3.75 ;)

This one centers around a family home that is more correctly called a mansion. The main characters are a brother and sister and the novel follows their lives and how the Dutch House is such an integral part of it. After their mother leaves, their father remarries and the kids’ lives change forever. A family story with all the right elements to draw you in. The audiobook is read by Tom Hanks which is quite enjoyable."
2033,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5626560-lauren,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is going to be a classic, I think. The characters are flawed but real people, and the house itself is treated similarly. I loved the nonlinear narrative that jumped by topic; it gave the novel a conversational quality, as if Danny were telling you about his life in episodes with which you were already familiar with the broad strokes. I listened to the audiobook with Tom Hanks narrating, and I think I had the experience of picturing him as Danny, and thanks to such a long acting career, Images of him at many stages of life were ready to fill in.I read other reviews that were really critical of Danny, perceiving him as self-absorbed and careless. Those of us who read the audiobook argue that we don’t see it. I agree that it’s too hard to separate Tom Hanks’ voice from the character and give Danny a fair assessment. "
2034,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5250236-reen,Rating 5 out of 5,"This was a fantastic book that was narrated by Tom Hanks. The story is about two siblings, Danny and Maeve, who deal with their father's remarriage and subsequent family issues in different ways. The losses they suffer bind them together and make them each other's biggest supporter and priority in life. Patchett is a skilled writer and wonderful story teller and brings the Dutch House to life with her vivid descriptions that make the house another character in the story. Hanks does an excellent job as narrator and I felt myself wishing the story would go on just a little bit longer. "

Engrossing, captivating, overall a pleasure. I loved the writing, the characters, the time period. I am fascinated by and would like to read insightful analyses on the codependent brother/sister relationship, how that dynamic can be caused by absent/uninvolved parents and/or all the different roles the extravagant house plays into it.

I found Maeve and Danny's relationship particularly interesting as Maeve is essentially Danny's stand in mother/sister. Maeve was old enough to remember bio mother Elna but Danny was an mere 4 years old (lots of discussion around HOW could a mother leave her babies...) Oh, and a legendary painting of Maeve that is as much a part of the Dutch House as it is the family. Ann Patchett’s storytelling is fantastic, and Tom Hanks narrates the audiobook version (bonus points). I consumed this book in 2 days."
2037,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"Everything Ann Patchett does is excellent. There's just no way around it. She has such a deft touch for characters and plot and description -- she does it all just right.The Dutch House was a slow build for me. There was a good amount of pages that I didn't think much of anything was happening. Yet I kept reading because I was captivated by the idea of her description of the presence of this house on its land and in the people's lives. Then I started to see where it was going, and I was already locked in. Patchett's writing is so good, that it's deep and literary without feeling too dense to wade through. As a reader, I just glide right along, all the while collecting deeper meanings and allusions and character traits. It's wonderful. She's wonderful. Read this book and all of her books, and marvel at the breadth of her talent. "
2038,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1939441-rebecca,Rating 3 out of 5,"I enjoyed the sibling relationship and them sticking together through so much. I thought it was fun to have it all centered around the house. I liked how it all came full circle, even without the characters realizing it was happening. Danny probably annoyed me the most. He just seemed so self absorbed. It’s likely the dad would’ve annoyed me more had he lasted longer though. Eh, but then there’s the mom. Pretty much some serious psychological issues going on in this book. But, it all works and made for a fun light hearted read, that I didn’t have to put much effort into. "
2039,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/835127-lisa-brown,Rating 5 out of 5,"Dutch House, a lavish and unique estate in the suburbs outside of Philadelphia, is the center of the life story of Danny, and his older sister, Maeve. The story unfolds over the course of fifty years, beginning when Cyril, their father, surprises their mother with the Dutch house and all its contents, and takes them through their abandonment of their mother, their father's unfortunate second marriage, and his eventual death. As things go from bad to worse for Danny and Maeve, they learn to completely rely on one another, building an unbreakable bond, and yet also are both still stuck in the past - unable to fully heal and let go of the Dutch House and all that it represents.Such a beautifully told story, and I loved it even more, because I listened to the audio book that was narrated by Tom Hanks - he was the perfect voice of Danny."

I grow impatient with people stuck in, or perhaps cherishing, the disfunctionality of their family. I found myself wanting to stamp my feet at the brother and sister who narrate the story and tell them to get on with their lives! Resenting their stepmother seemed to dominate their whole existence, and crippled their lives. What did it do to their stepmother? Almost nothing. Yet they were blind to that fact for so long.

I also found the book too descriptive and didn't care very much about the real estate business or even that Dutch house...Maybe that's why I couldn't feel any strong empathy for the narrator - I liked Maeve very much though.The plot didn't seem to move forward at some point and it definitely bored me, with those permanent time travels and siblings regularly parking in front of the house they left long ago.

She was looking at the trees.""But we overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we're not seeing it as the people we were, we're seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.”Listen to this one on a lazy Sunday afternoon in the voice of Tom Hanks."

Bel Canto has stayed with me for years. So did State of Wonder. I was a little less enamored with Commonwealth, and yet, there was that ""something"" that drew me to the book. And then, there is this book, which I really wasn't sure I would like the first 30-40 pages into it. But yet, there was that ""something"" once again. Perhaps but is the authenticity of the characters. They are so real - so, so real. But, in this case, the place itself took on special meaning, as anyone who has found themselves driving past homes from our childhoods. The Dutch House is so central to everything about the characters. That house, oh, that house - so important to Cyril, so abhorred by Maeve and Danny's mom, so coveted by Andrea, the evil stepmom... And, oh, that portrait of Maeve, instead of what should have been the portrait of Maeve and Danny's mother. I am not sure why I so love Patchett's novels, but I do know that I eagerly await the next one."

I love Patchett, in fact one might call me her biggest fan. She is among my favorite author, and I consider State of Wonder and Bel Canto to be rare contemporary masterpieces among literature. I couldn't wait to read The Dutch House, and I don't regret giving it my time. Like her other books, Patchett creates marvelous, multi-faceted characters who live and breath in and out of the page. Maeve is a wonder, and her brother is no less than the most vulnerable human, written by someone who deeply understands children. (The scene with the sisters took my breath away. How true and how beautiful understood.) My complaint with the novel lies in the plot in that I didn't feel that there was much of one. It seemed more of a memoir than a novel, and while I kept waiting for a greater plot to kick in, it never did. I enjoyed the Dutch House and I'm glad to have visited this little, privileged and brutal world, but I could have used more action to family dynamics."
2045,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1909872-zoe,Rating 5 out of 5,"A sneaky, subtle book that paints a portrait of a sister and brother, their relationship over the decades and their relationship with their past. Information is revealed to the main character, not secrets hidden, but information this well drawn human (I would swear all these were real people) just didn't notice before. It's a coming of age, then a coming of a different age story. Absolutely spellbinding, I listened to this in four days. Tom Hanks does such a good job narrating this - a humble voice for a humble book. Brilliant."
2046,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7037199-shweta-kumar,Rating 5 out of 5,I listened to the audiobook version of the book as read by Tom Hanks. I always loved the cover of the book and it’s been on my list forever but I somehow never read up on what the book is about. It was like starting a book blind but I’m so glad I took the plunge. A book about life and memories and how memories get altered and polished and even discarded. A story of flawed parenting and exceptional parenting and relationships that go through ebbs and flows and some that will persevere even beyond death. An enduring tale.

A do tego zaskakujące zakończenie. Wspaniała! „Dom Holendrów” to opowieść o rodzinie, którą łączy rezydencja z 1922 roku. Cyril Conroy wynajmuje odnowione przez siebie stare budynki. Chcąc zrobić żonie niespodziankę, kupuje Dom Holendrów, starą posiadłość z intrygującą historią. Jednak kobieta nie czuje się w nim komfortowo, chce pomagać biednym, żyć z nimi w skromnych warunkach. Pewnego dnia znika, niewielu potrafi wyjaśnić, gdzie jest i dlaczego porzuciła rodzinę, pojawiają się domysły, że wyjechała do Indii, aby opiekować się potrzebującymi. Kobieta porzuca przede wszystkim dzieci – Maeve i Danny’ego, które próbują odnaleźć się w nowej rzeczywistości. Maeve chcąc zapewnić młodszemu bratu normalny dom, wciela się w rolę jego opiekuna i zmienia całe swoje życie. Narratorem jest Danny, ukazuje traumę z dzieciństwa i trudne relacje rodzinne. Jego narracja przeplata przeszłość z teraźniejszością, powoli odkrywa wydarzenia, które ukształtowały rodzeństwo. Bliskie relacje między nimi były wyjątkowe, mogli na siebie liczyć. Autorka wspaniale przedstawiła ich oddanie i wzajemną troskę. Uwypukliła najprostsze zachowania, a zarazem najpiękniejsze. Książka ukazuje konflikt między pamięcią a refleksją, pewnym wyobrażeniem z dzieciństwa a dojrzałą analizą. Temat może wydaje się oklepany, ale tym, co czyni tę powieść wyjątkową, jest swego rodzaju prostota. Pisarka ukazuje wydarzenia zarówno z punktu widzenia dziecka, jak i dorosłego, którzy dzielą się swoimi spostrzeżeniami, oszustwami, próżnością, okrucieństwem i namiętnością. A zakończenie? A zakończenie opowieści jest trudne do odgadnięcia, bo ważą się ludzkie losy. Ta książka, pomimo trudnego tematu, jest takim plasterkiem na zbolałe serca. Polecam!"
2048,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3235307-donna,Rating 4 out of 5,"I found this to be an interesting book. It was written well, but I definitely had a few questions as I read through the book. I sometimes found that the flip-flopping between time periods was annoying. It would reveal what happened in the future when you were reading in the present. I also found that I would forget Danny was the narrator, especially in the beginning. I found that he wasn't very emotional and sometimes very 2-dimensional, but as I read further I think that was the way it was supposed to be because he was basically turning into someone very much like his father in the story - not completely but he had many of his father's qualities. I think it will be a story that sticks with me for a long time, just has the Dutch House seems to stick with everyone who enters it."
2049,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52052505-will,Rating 3 out of 5,"I really liked how Patchett depicts the complicated feelings that arise in familial situations. But, overall? This was just okay. Great book club fodder, but I had a few problems with the narrative structure. The biggest issue is with the point of view; the narrator's sister is FAR more interesting and dynamic than the narrator himself. I would've preferred this story to be told from her point of view. I've found recent family sagas from Celeste Ng and Brit Bennett to be much more engaging. Wouldn't be my Pulitzer vote, but if you really like 20th century family sagas, I would recommend this."

It did not end like I thought it would, which is even better since I loved the ending. Lots of emotions hit me while reading this book, the author did a great job of making that happen in the telling of this story.The thing that hit me, at the end, was the comment; ""but when you think about saints, I don't imagine any of them make their families happy."" What an interesting and profound thought. And what a saint Elna was to take care of Andrea in the end, saying she was her penance for all the mistakes.

For this, I’d give it 4.5 stars.-my personal feeling: I just could NOT get into it, and I really can’t say why. I tried so hard because friends have raved about it and written gushing reviews, but man it was just not for me. My personal star rating would be 2. "

Honestly I spent the majority of the book trying to figure out what the point was. I was bored to tears in most places and what got me through it was Tom Hanks narrating as I followed along. The timeline was often very confusing jumping around constantly. I felt the ending was rushed and cheesy. I couldn't really relate to any character, I just found myself overall very meh with the whole story. I'm happy that I did finish and didn't dnf."

At the end of the Second World War, Cyril Conroy acts on a tip from a fellow wounded soldier and makes a single investment to begin an enormous real estate empire, propelling his family from poverty to enormous wealth. He ends up buying the Dutch House, a lavish estate in the suburbs outside of Philadelphia. Meant as a surprise for his wife, the house sets in motion the undoing of everyone he loves.Upon Cyril's death his children are exiled from the house where they grew up by their stepmother. The two wealthy siblings are thrown back into the poverty their parents had escaped from and find that all they have to count on is one another. This book is like a dark fairy tale about two smart people who cannot overcome their past. They find a home in eachother, as they are failed by the adults who were supposed to nurture them. And the house - the house is a character in itself, exerting so much influence over the lives of all those who live in it.

That one purchase sets into motion a series of events that tears the family apart, and his children are left to pick up the pieces after their stepmother casts them out of the house and out of any inheritance after their father's death.

The main character came alive through Hanks interpretation and every inflection, tone, and phrasing gave this story depth. The relationship of the boy and his sister is the backbone to this story and colors the events that take place from childhood through adulthood. There is no reason to provide a summary, as there are plenty available, but it is important to give a nod to the perfect wedding of narrator to story's character. One of the best audio books I've listened to."

The story of a brother and sister is so heartwarming that one cannot help but get invested in their world. I enjoyed going on this ride with Danny and Maeve. At so many places in the story I felt my heart tug for Maeve, for the kind of sister she is, for the way she looks out for her baby brother. The siblings share a bond that nothing seems to impact, they are almost oblivious to everything and everyone else around them. I heard this book on Audible whilst reading it, and the experience was most certainly elevated for me. "

I loved Celeste and Fluffy and Jocelyn and Sandy. And I Hated the Dutch House !!!This novel has the density and depth of a Munro story. I loved it!! I swear Ann Patchett can sense or feel the pulse of every character she writes about. You can feel their anger, their dizziness, their frustration, their reservation. So impactful and so easy to connect with them.Also I swear she’s been reading Gabor Maté!"

I had picked it up a couple of times prior and decided to save it for a different time. I listened to Tom Hanks read the audiobook, despite also having a physical copy. I definitely enjoyed listening to his voice as he read. This was such a beautiful story, and a perfect selection for listening over the Christmas break. "

One of my only complaints was that the book would jump from the past, to the not so distant past, to the present with little indication. I’m sure there are page breakers on the physical copy of the book to signify this, but through an Audiobook it made the story hard to follow at times. Aside from this minor complaint, the story was phenomenal. This is a great story following a brother and sister (told from brothers perspective) as their lives changed from being rich, to being kicked out of their house by their stepmother, to becoming rich again, and how their relationship evolved throughout. Overall, I’d recommend. "
2063,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"Told in the incomparable Ann Patchett style, this is mostly a story centered around a beautiful mansion built by dutch immigrants who became unexpectedly wealthy selling cigarettes during World War One. The story is centered around and told by two siblings, children of another poor man who unexpectedly became wealthy after World War Two and buys the house. The two siblings are thrown out by their stepmother after their father's death and then their whole lives revolve around longing for the house and rage at their stepmother. Time softens these feelings over decades, and the book ends with a sense of peace and closure."

Sweeping family saga, multi-generational without getting bogged down in POVs, and soooooo much character development. Yeaaaah. And the best ending I’ve read in a long, long time. If I were teaching creative writing, this would be my go-to model text for how to wrap up a book. (It’s not just bring it back to the beginning and close all ties and relationships...No. It’s an ending. It’s closure. Its amazing.) Highly recommended.

This book gripped me and made for a couple of short nights because I just couldn't stop reading. There aren't a lot of huge happenings in this book, but Patchett is so good at telling the drama of ordinary lives that it is absolutely gripping. Don't let this one pass you by. "

I’m still not sold on the obsession over the house of the main characters, though: I understand it’s not just about the building, and that it holds larger significance, but there’s a lot of narrative space devoted to it, to a point where it detracted from plausible character development (for me).

2078,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Dutch House is one of my favorite books of 2020. I thought it was so well written and the characters so well developed. The setting is the suburbs of Philadelphia and a beautiful home known as the Dutch House. The story of the Conroy family is told by the son, Danny, who is devoted to his older sister Maeve. Described as a “dark fairy tale” with a missing mother, an evil stepmother and displacement from their family home. The reader gets travel through fifty years of their lives come full circle back to the Dutch House. For me it spoke my memories of our family home which our family owned over fifty years with the memories of its appearance and the years filled with abundance of emptions. I liked the brother – sister relationship and related to my closeness with my sister who is 6 years older than me. "
2079,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40904054-m-carmichael,Rating 2 out of 5,"I just did not like this book. I found it boring at times, did not really care about what happened to the narcissist characters, and overall, the plot was ""blah"" to me. I felt the narrative jumps in time killed whatever excitement was created during the somewhat compelling childhood conflicts. I feel sheepish criticizing the effort. Obviously, the author is accomplished and professional and who am I to give judgement? Life's too short for a book that does not grab you though."
2080,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3995288-nanette,Rating 2 out of 5,"Such a drag. I kept waiting for the reason it is so highly acclaimed but NOTHING EVER HAPPENED. A few moments of philosophical insight like: “But we overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.” A few moments of stellar prose like: ""There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you’d been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet in place, and for a moment you’re suspended, knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself."" These rare moments of epiphany were what kept me reading, but generally a slog with no pay dirt at the end."
2081,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39547149-judy-blachek,Rating 5 out of 5,"I loved this book when I read it, but when I heard that Tom Hanks did the audio version, I decided to listen to it too. What a total delight! Tom made the funny lines even more amusing and the ironic ones more ironic. Most audio book readers take the numbering of the chapters very seriously and use a monotone. But Tom made each one sound kind of quirky and again, fun. I didn't think I could love Tom Hanks or this book more, but I was wrong on both counts. "
2082,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/73058960-sherrylady,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is such a great (and underrated!) book. I listened to it on audiobook and Tom Hanks's voice definitely improved the quality of my experience. The characters were so beautifully depicted and I got to know everyone throughout many years of their lives and their struggles. I couldn't decide if I liked some of them or not, since they were grey characters.The book is very slow and nothing super exciting happens, but somehow I was intrigued to find out what was going to happen to this brother and sister (MCs). I loved the relationship between these sibilings and how dependent they were on each other, but at the same time I could see how difficult it must have been to be the boy's wife, since he wasn't that involved in his own family! I smiled, laughed, teared up, got angry, was shocked and basically felt so many human emotions while listening to this book, and enjoyed it thoroughly."
2083,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3860167-iris,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Dutch House is a multilayered story of the Conroy family which travels back and forth across five decades. It seems to have a fairytale quality..a bit of Hansel and Gretel, Cinderella and the evil stepmother all mixed together. Themes of abandonment and redemption prominent in the story.The character development is believable with the relationship between brother and sister central throughout. Highly recommended."
2084,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2263652-lisa-penninga,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book, overall, was an intricately woven web of how the past is always a part of who we are and if we aren’t careful, it can taint our future. My favorite partof this book is the concept of the Dutch House. It’s complexity and tension depending on each character’s POV was beautifully created. The concept of orphan was really powerful and complex, too. It was a slow read for me, not one I couldn’t wait to pick back up, but one I enjoyed as a I read it. "
2085,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"I found this to be an intriguing story. I give much of that credit to the author and the way she presented it. Maeve and Danny, sister and brother, are extremely close. They were growing up in a middle class neighborhood until their father purchases The Dutch House. It’s an opulent mansion which his wife hates and never adjusts to. She ends up leaving the family. The children grow up not knowing why she left and where she went. Their dad remarries a younger woman with two daughters and she basically takes over. Throughout the years, the relationship become more broken and several things occur. The story follows the adult lives of Maeve and Danny, what happens with their dad, mom, stepmom and The Dutch House. "
2086,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2422493-patty,Rating 3 out of 5,"Debating 2.5 to 3 stars. It was good, but it was just so depressing. I actually like reading all about the house design and layout, though not so sure how well it would function in reality with everyone being able to see right into the house. It is a story about dysfunctional characters within a family, and even extended family. A father who is distant and removed from his children, a mother who left her children, two young children who are very attached to each other, although in not such healthy ways at times, a hateful and unhappy step mother, and her two children, although we don't hear much about them. If you like reading about the dysfunctional dynamics within a family then this book is for you. "
2087,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11664994-tyler,Rating 4 out of 5,Intriguing premise and the characters certainly felt fully realized. Patchett does an excellent job weaving the story together and providing payoffs intermittently. I found the ending unsatisfying despite all the build up. But maybe that's part of this family's story? You can't undo all the years and fix all the broken relationships. You can just try to move forward even if that has to be without closure.
2088,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1444977-ann,Rating 4 out of 5,"Overall I quite enjoyed this book. The audio read by Tom Hanks is truly a treat to listen to.To me “the Dutch House” is the most interesting character in the book. All other characters had a unique relationship to the house-but it was also what they all had in common.This quote from Wikipedia page is a great summary: Publishers Weekly gave the novel a rave review, writing, ""Patchett's splendid novel is a thoughtful, compassionate exploration of obsession and forgiveness, what people acquire, keep, lose or give away, and what they leave behind."""
2089,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/141029146-olivia-fortson,Rating 4 out of 5,"after some reflection, i actually enjoyed this book, but i can see why you shouldn’t. a privileged white man talking about his mommy issues and how he only loves his sister. at some times it’s infuriating that he loathes in self pity and doesn’t see his privilege. however… i like it because it shows the ambivalent feelings of forgiving your parents, especially when they weren’t there. it could have done without some of the more boring parts but at the same time i couldn’t stop reading. i think i just relate to the main character in ways and that is why i connected with this book.

2090,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4788285-kelly-pfaefflin,Rating 5 out of 5,"A story all about family - the dysfunction, the loss, the grief, the bond between brother and sister, reconnecting with family members, the people who aren’t blood but still family, etc. I loved everyone’s connection to The Dutch House - what originally brought them to the house (and brought everyone together), the house was the reason for driving some away but how everyone ended up back there at the end one way or another. Also, who would love a book read by Tom Hanks? So soothing "
2091,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2767660-nevena,Rating 5 out of 5,"Listening to Tom Hanks narrate The Dutch House solidified the echoes between this masterpiece and Robert Redford’s rendition of Norman McLean’s A River Runs Through It, a favorite of mine. Patchett beautifully delved into the intricacies of intimacy - both familial and individual. Her deft exploration of both intergenerational evolution and stagnancy was poetic in its simplicity as well as grand in its authenticity. Just beautiful. "
2092,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,Intriguing book although I had a hard time keeping the key people in place. It starts and ends with this intriguing house which belonged to a wealthy Dutch family and the people who lived there and the people who were outside that circle. I had to make a list of all the key people so I wouldn't get confused by the names. It is a complex story and I had to read closely but I was satisfied when I finished it. It will be interesting to see how the rest of my reading group feels about it.

A person sharing their family drama and the twists and turns that families create for one another. As family members age they leave and find their own family, The Dutch House is that perfect example. Characters leaving their grand home to be independent, which looks different for each person.. I mean character. Fantastic story."
2095,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18097473-allen-cooley,Rating 3 out of 5,"Sigh. This was an extremely frustrating book. I wanted to like it but could not bring myself to get there. The prose works and can be beautiful at times and the story is full of characters that are fully realized. However, the book could have been easily and heavily edited down about 150 pages and there would be no effect to the story being told. It’s too long with not a lot happening. I was also frustrated that the author chose to tell the story out of order. It honestly serves no purpose and does not change up the action (there hardly is any) so why do it? And all of this is circling around the main theme (character?) of the story which is the Dutch House itself. I felt that the characters’ attachment to the house is forced. Even the characters themselves question throughout the story why they keep coming back to it without any answers and it’s not believable. Frustrating. "

É Danny, o filho mais novo, que recorda o passado e nos revela tudo o que aconteceu. Através do seu relato tomamos consciência de que os espaços que habitamos na infância permanecem em nós e ocupam um lugar cativo na nossa memória. É também com o protagonista que nos comovemos com o amor fraterno, o qual mesmo quando sujeito a inúmeras provações, permanece intacto, indestrutível e constrói-se ainda mais forte. Maeve e Danny unem-se para enfrentar a saga familiar e para encontrar o seu lugar no mundo."

I typically favor books with a good plot twist, action and drama and this.. had very little of any of those things. Patchett’s gift is making a very basic story so incredibly vivid through beautiful writing and thoughtful detail that you fall in love without any embellishment of plot. The ending scene will stick with me for a long time. "
2098,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7348367-briana,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book hit me in the right places. It's not only an examination of how players in our childhood are remembered or even considered with a child's brain, but also architecture and home being a central character in our formative years. I still dream about my childhood home and it plays a major part in what I can actually remember from my childhood. In my dreams I'm often a stranger to it, an outcast returning and finding things changed but also familiar, rooms larger or smaller than remembered, or finding danger there, or hiding there to escape from some malicious person with ill intent. The characters in The Dutch House deal with the loss of their house, their home, and the person who dealt this blow. It was easy for me to feel the rage and grief over their loss of home, almost as much as the loss of parents,which is also the case for them, and myself. Maybe that's why or how a house can become equally as important as a parent... the house should technically be even more permanently available. Parents die, houses continue... unless you are exiled in some way from those walls, never to have access to them again. "

Tom Hanks narrates it and his voice is just perfect for this novel. It’s a character-driven novel, so don’t expect any major plot turns. It’s just a wonderful, quiet story of a brother and sister and the house they grew up in. "
2103,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"I love a surprising main character and the Dutch house was it! No spooky mystery to solve, just an unusual foil for the characters as they developed. Ann Patchett’s ability to unwrap a character slowly and in surprising ways, keeps you hooked. Her dialogue is so real and smart and as I listened to the tale through Tom Hank’s narration, I was so sorry to hear it end. What will happen to this next generation of Dutch Housers?"

The ties of their past bond Danny and Maeve..Tom Hanks does an amazing job narrating this novel.

I think one thing that I've begun to appreciate about my own reading taste this year is that I often really like a book that contains some ambiguity. It is at least partially for this reason that I enjoyed this book. Who did the right thing? Who should be blamed? How else could this all have transpired? I think this would be a fantastic book for a book club. "

The first 1/3 or so of the book kept my attention and had some great potential....but nothing really happens. It's an anti climactic story about a set of siblings. The characters are usually (not always) interesting, fine. The narrative has some lovely imagery, fine. But...I feel as though something was lacking. Maybe I'm all jaded because my own family life and homesteads are much more dramatic in real life. Other people clearly live this book, so by all means please form your own opinion.

There is no struggle, no hardship, except their own resentment and missing their mom. They get educated and have good careers and are more or less happy and eventually all their dreams come true.

2133,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24059064-kelly,Rating 4 out of 5,"I loved this book, especially with Tom Hanks reading it to me while I drove my car.It's a well-written saga of a house and all the people who occupied it over time, but at it's center is the bond between a brother and sister. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good family drama or books that take place over several decades."
2134,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8352625-jamie,Rating 5 out of 5,"I had a hard time getting into this story; I started it 3 or 4 times. Finally I went for it and I’m so glad I did. Patchett has such a knack for character development and I appreciated such a different story. Though it wasn’t the most exciting story, I still found myself reading quicker than others because the exquisite writing. Definitely would recommend to anyone for a good story of a family drama."
2135,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12659115-valerie-campbell-ackroyd,Rating 4 out of 5,"Started slow but ultimately a beautiful storyI wasn’t sure if I would enjoy this, it was a Book Club choice. And, when I first began the story about the house, about the sad children, the distant father, young stepmother, absent mother, I still wasn’t sure. But somewhere around the 70th page, I became entranced.The story is told from the perspective of Danny, a boy who grew into a man sheltered by his strong older sister. Who went to medical school but never practiced medicine. In many ways the story is ordinary but not—it’s about resentment, loss, relationships, mistakes, forgiveness, and the future unfolding. Patchett is a great writer. She tells a story much like, as one of the characters is described in the book, a Scheherazade. You think that the story is winding down and then something else floats in.The only character in the book that I had issues with was the mother, Elna. She is gone for 2/3 of the book and when she appears Danny is hugely resentful of the manner in which she returns. And I felt resentful right along with him. And the story of why she left is one that I am not really sure Patchett explains. But, then, some things in life are inexplicable. As another character in the book says, Elna is a saint and saints are often very difficult for their family to deal with.The other issue I have is with what happens to Maeve. I won’t give the plot away but I felt that Maeve deserved more happiness than I felt Patchett gave her. Still I believe it’s a mark of a good writer where one can argue with the plot, disagree with it, but still be glad to have spent hours inside it."
2136,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7403521-zoie,Rating 5 out of 5,"Beautifully and originally written. One of the best books I've read in a long time. Well...I listened to the audiobook, let's be honest. Narrated by Tom Hanks? How could I pass that up?Profanity: Several ""F words,"" and a few others. Not profuse, but certainly present.Sex: Mentioned, but nothing explicit.Alcohol/Drug Use: Adults smoke often.Violence: Nothing memorable."
2137,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13195498-caitlin-johnston,Rating 4 out of 5,"Really a 4.5. A compelling story about a family and the house that witnessed so much. I’m particularly drawn to the strong bond shared by siblings and the idea of how we sometimes bend our lives to unbelievable angles trying to please others. This is a story about those breaking points and how we move past them.“I looked up at the high ceiling, into the chandelier. ‘Lots of ghosts.’Sandy smiled. ‘The ghosts are what I come for.’”"
2138,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/120042710-cassidy-christensen,Rating 4 out of 5,"After reflecting a bit more, I think I would rate this a four. It was strangely engrossing even though I didn’t find the character development or plot to be fully articulated. A lot of the action happens in the final pages, and I was left feeling frustrated at the decisions made and the somewhat ambivalent perspective of the narrator on things that very much warrant emotional responses- life milestones, love, death, heartbreak. While gripping and a great read, I wouldn’t rank this among the best I’ve ever read. "
2139,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3949887-rachel,Rating 5 out of 5,"Wow. I finished this one and immediately texted all my friends to see who else had read it so we could discuss.The themes of family and anger and pain and disillusionment and love and stress and class and ...just everything. It's all so well done. It resonated with me on so many levels. Not that I have personally been subject to so many hard and awful things like Danny and Maeve, but their hyperbolic trials magnified normal feelings of regret and pain that we all have. Ann Patchett is truly a master."
2140,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3948449-rachel,Rating 3 out of 5,"Somewhat disappointing because I desperately wanted a scene where Danny one day notices that Maeve and Mr. Otterson are wearing matching wedding rings, demands to know what the hell is going on, and Maeve reminds him that they’ve been married for the past fifteen years...and he was at the wedding...as the best man... This dude could not remember anything."
2141,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24158854-jane,Rating 5 out of 5,This is one of the best novels I have read in years. I will acknowledge that I am a “house person.” I find houses compelling. And the way that this house fuses to the Conroy children’s mothers - including Andrea. None of them have the house and none of them have their mothers. It’s truly one of those books where the characters stay with you after their story is over.
2142,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20297194-holly-gruszecki,Rating 3 out of 5,"I hated this book until the very end. While it IS beautifully written (and for that it probably deserves 5 stars), it’s essentially a sad story about a sad family. I’ll admit, the last chapter was nice. But otherwise I mostly just feel sad now about the things people do out of duty, and the choices people make no matter how bad they are. "
2143,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26712557-blake-mcadow,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book feels like eating some quality diner food. It's satisfyingly well put together, and you will enjoy the entire experience cover to cover. For better or worse though, nothing is really going to surprise you. The characters are who they are and there is a lot to be said for it, but sometimes the edges fray a bit, and the cardboard shows itself behind the characters living out their roles. Maybe this is due to the book being from Danny's perspective. His father is always a brick wall, Andrea always a monster, his sister always inscrutable. Danny often feels like a Nick Carraway, if he were actually Gatsby's child. He's an empty vessel through which we view the much more interesting women in his life. I can relate to him in a lot of ways, I know the sting of realizing you've never really participated in your own life, even without a mansion plopped in the suburbs to direct my life. His whole life he spends chasing his father's ghost like late rent payments. The Dutch House is an engaging read, I found myself coming out of reading sessions feeling drunk and strange, unused to how to live in the real world with my real brain. It's worthwhile, and tense and says much about the closure, or the lack there of we have in our lives. "
2144,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/129529652-jill-carvalho,Rating 3 out of 5,I liked this book a lot but did not love it. But there was something so sad the entire time it felt like Cinderella almost but with a unhappy ending. The obsession with house and Andrea consumed them and perhaps ruined both Danny and Maeves life. To me the mom Elin was also very selfish she cares a lot for people but not as much for her own children. I liked Commonwealth much better. But it’s definitely worth reading maybe I was expecting too much. 
2145,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/93490762-patrick-ede,Rating 5 out of 5,"If you asked me what I liked about this book, I’d say “I really don’t know. It was just so nice to read”. Two things I will say though. It reminds me of East Of Eden in that, you watch the effects of family over the lifetimes of people. And second the author has that magic ability to make you think that what she told you, you actually believed all along. "

2147,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36740740-ron-cross,Rating 5 out of 5,"There’s nothing particularly astounding about the Dutch House in terms of plot. It’s the story of a family and the important relationships in their lives, in particular the wonderful relationship that can form between a brother and sister. And yet I was riveted from the opening pages. Maybe it was simply Tom Hanks’s reading in the audiobook, but I just really settled into this one early on. I loved the family drama, the incredibly well-developed characters and their interactions, the descriptions of place and the time period. It might not deliver a wallop, but the emotion is still there, just more low key. I can see why it was a Pulitzer finalist. Really enjoyed this one. "
2148,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1639347-robin,Rating 3 out of 5,"A little slow placed, but I loved listening to Tom Hanks narrate. The story was good, but melancholy. Siblings Danny and Maeve grow up in the Dutch House, experience loss together, visit as adults from the outside, and are always there for each other. While heartwarming, I felt an overall sensation of loss, sadness, and that's-just-life feeling."

So nice to listen to, like watching a movie 😊The book itself was not really my type, but interesting enough. Something different from what I usually read, it seemed a little bit too ordinary. So many decisions, made for all the wrong reasons, so much grief, pain and not letting go. I think I learnt to understand it a little. But I feel like I should re-read it in 5-10 years."

It takes a little bit to get into (this was my second try reading it) because on the surface, not much happens. It’s a quiet portrait of life in all its complexity and the relationships we form with each other (or fail to form) when things go sideways. "

2153,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63391194-hannah-briggs,Rating 2 out of 5,"This book really disappointed me. It started out strong and promising but just dragged on and left me feeling blah. I was hoping for more of a promising ending. For instance, when the portrait of Maeve was taken down maybe a hidden panel in the wall with the true will of The Dutch House being left to Danny and Maeve? Ha I don’t know. Just a little more of a twist or something. I do appreciate the message of forgiveness in the story but overall I’m left just wondering what the entire point of this book was. "

His rhythm and intonation made it feel like a friend was just talking to you and telling you a story, which really drew me in. The story and writing were very descriptive and ""literary,"" so I'm pretty sure I would have been hopelessly bored if I read it physically. The story overall was okay, but not much happens."

I need to read Patchett’s other works because her writing comes very natural while still retaining that nuance and intricacy.

The main themes were love and emotional dependence between siblings, staying anchored to the past and letting it define you, family bonds and forgiveness.Huge plus: Tom Hanks narrating the audiobook ❤️"
2157,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/98514369-eva,Rating 3 out of 5,"This book is very mundane and muted. It is repetitive, the characters are unlikeable, and my goodness - they are all obsessed with their silly little Dutch House. I feel like I would've enjoyed this book more if I read it in a shorter time span, because unfortunately I was not able to give it justice when I was ready to be done reading it. Ann Patchett has been on my radar since last year, and I am both slightly disappointed and satisfied with her writing and storytelling. I am looking forward to reading more of her books when I have the time and dedication to do so. "
2158,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5245204-brittany-hilgemeier,Rating 3 out of 5,"What Tom Hanks has taught me in this audiobook is that if a man uses a slightly deeper voice to narrate a book, he can use his natural voice for the female characters. I’m astounded. Sneaky and amazing. Overall I enjoyed this. There were several moments where I thought, “where is this going?” or “what is the end goal here?” but I think listening to a book makes me a bit more patient and I didn’t feel like it dragged on."

Narrated by Tom Hanks (possibly the best part of enjoying this book), Danny and Maeve are two siblings who grow up in an enormous house, only to lose their mother and their way. But their bond remains through thick and thin, giving the reader lots to consider."
2161,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57511817-nadia-hakim,Rating 5 out of 5,"Tom Hanks narrating this audiobook is perfection. The story follows the complicated story of a brother and sister navigating the world with parents and without parents, with everything they could ever need and with nothing. Their love for one another is simple and pure, and you can’t help but laugh and cry with them. I loved their banter. I loved the characters."
2162,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5600519-samantha-olson,Rating 5 out of 5,I loved this book! I found it to be beautifully written and interestingly enough drew me in to be quite obsessive with it just as the main characters were obsessed with the house. The first book I read by Ann Patchett was “Commonwealth” and I HATED it. You can tell by reading both these books that Patchett has an interest in families and their dynamics…”The Dutch House” just portrayed those themes better and more eloquently. LOVED! 
2163,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8785015-lisa,Rating 5 out of 5,"I have never read anything by Ann Patchett before The Dutch House, but I plan on reading more of her work. Surviving life with imperfect people is the nature of the human experience. Patchett’s story told through the youngest sibling Danny brings a unique perspective of family dynamics, loneliness, betrayal, and healing. I highly recommend this novel. I listened to the audiobook narrated by Tom Hanks. His characterization of Danny allows us to see ourselves in all of our relationships and encourages us to do a little better than we did the day before to love those who stump us. "

Ann Patchet's essay collection ""These Precious Days"" was my favorite read of 2022, so I wanted to try out her fiction and I was not disappointed! This is a sweeping novel that tells the story of a family, a house, a pair of siblings. It took me about 80 pages to get into it and then I was hooked. I thought in the middle that I was going to walk away with a new favorite novel, but I think Patchett was building such a big story with such great characters that the ending was a let down for me. "

I can picture the house so vividly in my mind, Patchett’s detailed discerption is flawless. I felt so much emotion on their behalf about the way Andrea treated them, I felt legitimately angry at times.

There are a few fiction writers who seem to write so effortlessly, the story and words just pour onto the page easily and smoothly and believably. Ann Patchett is one of those kind of writers.

It had some great potential but it never carried me to a high and the ending left me feeling relatively unfulfilled. I enjoyed the character development of the siblings, and the intrigue of the Dutch house, but I didn't feel the rest of the characters and their relationships were well developed. I guess I was looking for a little more plot from her. Bel Canto, Run, and The State of Wonder I hold in high esteem!"
2192,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3608068-pam,Rating 5 out of 5,"For me, The Dutch House, was one of those books that I hoped would never end. It was a book that made me feel like I was a part of it. I wasn't reading about someone else, I was involved. And, with the added joy of listening to Tom Hanks read the audio book, it was a great experience."
2193,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61434298-adrian-nester,Rating 5 out of 5,I loved this book from start to finish. Tom Hanks as the audiobook narrator was fantastic. I didn’t realize that I had read 2 other Patchett novels (Commonwealth and State of Wonder) and really enjoyed them as well.I would categorize it as a great book club book...with just enough heaviness and depth addressing the human condition. 
2194,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3503053-tammy,Rating 5 out of 5,"Really loved this book. Loved the brother/sister bond, the generational span of the story, the role the house plays throughout their lives, the way the characters grow and change, the bitter and the sweet. Tom Hanks did a super job narrating. Really enjoyable read."
2195,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/122011-loretta,Rating 5 out of 5,"Ann Patchett, man. She can always get me. Combined with Tom Hanks as the voice of Danny? That really worked for me. I do think I'll likely want to re-read in paper/ebook form at some point. The structure and the layers of family pain/connection; the slow reveal of memories and mysteries; just the whole way she writes. Patchett is still in my top 10, and this one resonated a lot. "

2197,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2185434-elizabeth,Rating 3 out of 5,"It’s probably closer to 3.5 or 4 stars but sometimes I get distracted listening to an audio book on my walks or in the car. That being said, I highly recommend the audio version because TOM HANKS narrates. Such a great voice for Danny. "
2198,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/89439456-mary,Rating 2 out of 5,"I didn't like this as much as State fo Wonder. This book dragged on half way through. The ending was very ""post-modern"" (meaning anti-climatical). The narrator was a pretty boring guy. There is a lot to talk about for book club concerning the characters... But I wouldn't recommend this book. "
2199,no user info,Rating 3 out of 5,"After this book was recommended to me repeatedly on Goodreads, Libby, and Kindle, I was excited to finally have the chance to listen to it. I began the book with little understanding of the plot but was hoping that this might teach me something or be eye opening. Instead, I felt that I kept waiting for the Patchett to get to the point, and was not overly drawn into the book or excited to keep listening at times. I’m glad that this book is now moved off of my to-read shelf, but have little desire to read it again in the future."
2200,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5088288-erika,Rating 3 out of 5,I really tried to love this book and I really couldn’t! I listened on audio and just could never get into it. By the last 30% of it I was invested enough to finish but this one just didn’t do it for me.

The story is comforting and real like your favorite sweater on a chilly day. The characters are well developed. It was perfectly wrapped up, no loose ends. Beautiful and perfect.♥️"
2202,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"Saints are never appreciated by their families. This is only one of the themes of this book, but it is one that will stick with me. Of course there is The Dutch House and its influence on the people who lived there. There are complex family relationships and love, hate, guilt, and forgiveness. It's a book that is hard to sum up, but an excellent, thought provoking story."
2203,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,I loved this book. The characters were so relatable. Interesting that it was from the brother Danny’s perspective when Maeve would have been the obvious narrator but it all makes sense in the end. It was definitely worth every bit of the hype around the book.

Although I’m not one who loves audiobooks (I usually find myself “wandering” and not paying attention to the story so I prefer to read it myself), I’m so glad I listened to it. I love Tom Hanks and truly enjoyed him reading me a story. What a great narrator! No surprise there, he’s so expressive. This is definitely in the running for my favorite book of 2020 so far. "

I wept through the last chapters, and felt the kind of cathartic relief that only comes when you see yourself and part of your story in a book written by a stranger you will never know, but who recognizes you. "
2207,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68433210-elizabeth,Rating 4 out of 5,"I listened to the audiobook with Tom Hanks narrating. It was a great story of family with all of the complicated layers, but mostly it’s the story of two siblings, Danny and Maeve Conroy growing up and supporting each other through life’s joys and sorrows. This was fast paced and compelling. "

After reading some of the reviews on goodreads, I went for audiobook for this and I loved it . Tom Hanks is a fantastic and impeccable narrator. He could make each character's voice sound distinctive enough to stand apart from rest. Loved listening to him."
2211,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9697916-megan,Rating 4 out of 5,"I really enjoyed this. I’m not sure what I was expecting but this was not it. The Dutch house is central to the plot and remains so even when not there. The siblings were well written and engrossing, Maeve especially. I felt like I wanted to know her more, but in a good way. I feel like Patchett wrote just enough to pique the readers interest and imagination."
2212,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21688766-diane,Rating 4 out of 5,3.5 starsI loved how the author wove together a story crossing several decades in a way that was interesting and understandable. However I didn't love the characters and felt like the ending was predictable.
2213,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5745883-elise,Rating 4 out of 5,My first Ann Patchett and will not be my last. I was pleasantly surprised by this slow moving character study. I can see why some people wouldn't enjoy this one as not much happens throughout the book but I personally loved the characters and the quiet nature of the novel.4*

I believe it's a very good book,maybe not one for me.I found it to be a very immersing work, with complex and multi dimensional characters. I imagined carefully the Dutch House and it was fun to play the scenes in my head with such detail.The relationship between Maeve and Danny is beautiful, with the siblings seeking an home in each other. I enjoy their characters, although I found Danny to be quite boring and irritating at times.If you enjoy novels, dysfunctional families, a mysterious and consuming House... this book is for you!"
2216,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71555080-kathy,Rating 5 out of 5,I loved this book. I listened to it on audiobook - Tom Hanks is a great narrator - but the story really resonated with me. I haven’t laughed or cried as much with a novel in a long time. Her characters are truly real and vivid. Loved it.
2217,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20939242-andreea-josan,Rating 3 out of 5,"I finished it yesterday and I am still Unsure about the rating. I listened to the audio, which was narrated by Tom Hanks and that aspect was wonderful. And the book itself made me think how some things can change and affect the course of our lives, how wealth can come between people and how a grudge can waste a life. But my problem with this book was that it didn't ping my emotional chords. I couldn't relate withe any of the characters."

It took me a few pages but soon enough I was completely absorbed in this family saga!"
2219,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59082529-olivia-berman,Rating 4 out of 5,A very engrossing read — didn’t love it quite as much as Bel Canto but I did like how certain twists happened fairly late in the story and how Patchett moves back and forth seamlessly between different times in Danny and Maeve’s lives. Loved it
2220,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34986712-parker-taylor,Rating 4 out of 5,I love the writing and I love the setting of this book. I loved Maeve and a few of the other female characters. The male characters were insufferable at times (landlords bleh) but the writing is so enchanting it still gets a solid 4 from me. 
2221,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"Four and a half stars. This is my favorite of Ann Patchett's novels. I've always felt the reader's stage in life influences his/her reaction to a story. This narrative resonates with me because I understand the power of a wonderful house to affect those living in it. In this case, the Dutch house is a character in the story, the only one who does not change over the years. It does have its own secrets, hidden spots no one has known about. Meanwhile, the families who've lived there try in differing ways to come to terms with their past. This looking back, and reevaluating family dynamics from a different perspective, changes them, and Ann Patchett tells the story beautifully. Her writing seems to flow so easily; nothing feels contrived or forced. There's nostalgia, love, and forgiveness, but no syrupy sentimentality. I loved this novel."
2222,no user info,No Rating,"I would rate The Dutch House as 9/10. I was captivated by the story as it unfolded and was drawn to the major (and minor) characters, and was completely immersed in the storyline. My only critique would be the ending, as I found it somewhat unbelievable, given the history of the 'house' and its inhabitants. Great read overall!"
2223,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/117704126-rachel-morrison,Rating 5 out of 5,Dark fairy tale: Inheritance. Love. Forgiveness. Strong Cinderella vibes. Two siblings Danny and Maeve raised in the Dutch house. A lavish house meant to bring the family joy and prosperity but leads the unraveling of the family. I totally judge books by the ending and this one nailed it for me. Highly recommend.

2226,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/128216762-caroline-pfeiffer,Rating 2 out of 5,... this is THE most frustrating novel I think I’ve ever read??? Has decent enough characters to keep you reading all 3f*cking37 pages but doesn’t have the decency to have an interesting plot until the last 30 pages. 
2227,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,I loved the way the book flowed so seamlessly from past to present and how the story was centralized around a home. Ann Patchett really makes you connect with the characters while helping you to see that their flaws are what makes them human. I definitely want to read her other books!

I listened to the audiobook and Tom Hanks as a narrator is my everything. I love a character-driven book, so this book fits my preferences to a tee. As an older sister, I was completely invested in the older sister/younger brother dynamics throughout the book. Absolutely beautiful writing. I am not sure many authors could have pulled off a timeline such as the one Patchett created in this book, it was masterful. I knocked off a star because it slowed down A LOT in the last 100 pages, almost to the point of tedium, but by that point, I was too invested in the characters' lives to mind too much. "
2232,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5849317-katie,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5 stars. I really liked all but the last third of this book. The fist two-thirds were exceptionally written and drew me in immediately. Extremely well developed characters - so much so that you feel like you could identify them in a police line up. Sadly, the end of the book seemed rushed and forced and unlikely. Still very much worth the read. A Cinderella storyline that takes unexpected turns and leaves you wanting to park outside the Dutch House yourself. The bond between siblings was my favorite feature of the book. "
2233,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2845929-helen-dunn,Rating 4 out of 5,I always like Ann Patchett books and this one had a familiar local touch so I liked it even more -- still this gets a very good 4 and not a 5 star rave review.It's a simple story about a beautiful house and what it meant to the different people who lived and worked in it and how their lives unfolded...for better or worse. Set mostly in the Philadelphia suburbs where I grew up so it was fun to see all the towns and parishes I knew so well scattered throughout.
2234,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62799609-jess-mcdonald,Rating 5 out of 5,Most of the book I wasn’t sure if I would like it - the narrator is unreliable and not admirable - but in Patchett fashion the ending is magnificent. I loved Bel Canto and this is right up there as well. Redemption accomplished…

This purchase changes everything for his children, Danny and Maeve - driving out their mother, and leading to Cyril's remarriage and their exile from the house by their stepmother.

I listened to the Tom Hanks narration and the combination of the gorgeous story and his voice was like sitting around the fireplace at night having a beloved friend or family member read to me.

The prose didn’t feel as magical and straightforward yet deep as the other two AP books I’ve read.

Manifestations of wealth (The Dutch House) and accompanying guilt? shame? emptiness? You are the one that knows yourself best. Appreciate inherited parental traits more. Distant father was too compelling of a character for only 1/3 of the book. What does forgiveness require (difficult for me to find compassion for Elna)? ‘Andrea lost her mind. What kind of justice is that?’ Years of anger leaving you in one breath.

The narrator is a man who holds his grudges tight, is blind to his own faults, and the miniature changes in him take a lifetime (and over 300 pages).

A novel that clutches the heart."
2256,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/901248-isabell,Rating 5 out of 5,"This story about family, grief, memory, sibling relationships, revenge and forgiveness was written so well, and the settings and characters drawn so vividly, that it feels entirely real to me. It’s like a Victorian novel set in contemporary times, replete with family drama, mansion, villain, but most of all the art of character-driven storytelling and human portraiture. There is no urgency to get through a fanciful plot and I love that. Extra points for the Catholic elements, as well as the real estate and medical talk.4.5 stars - not quite 5 - because the ending did not feel as honest as the rest of the book."

Personerna kändes äkta och Patchetts sätt att förflytta sig mellan berättelsens olika tidsplan var underbart – sömlöst men tydligt. Att författaren på det här sättet avslöjar stora händelser i ett tidigt skede gör inte berättelsen mindre spännande eller fascinerande – snarare tvärtom.

Päädyin kuitenkin kolmoseen. The Dutch House on ensisijaisesti tunnelmakirja ja kaikessa yksinkertaisuudessaan se onnistuu vangitsemaan lukijan Dannyn ja Maeven mielenmaisemiin täysin. Kuuntelin tän äänikirjana ja Tom Hanks sopi lukijaksi ihanan pehmeällä etelänmurteella niin hyvin, etten voinut kuunnellessa olla hymyilemättä.Kieli on kuvailevaa ja kaunista, mutta hahmot, heidän väliset suhteet ja miljöö kannattelevat teosta voimakkaammin kuin tapahtumat tai kuvaus. Miksi sitten kolme tähteä? Olisin ehkä kaivannut enemmän selitystä esimerkiksi Andrean toiminnalle. Myös omaan makuun monet kohtaukset tuntuivat liian lyhyiltä; pidän sellasesta makustelusta.Mutta tähän oli kyllä ihanaa uppoutua. Etenkin sisaruskuvaus saa kyllä paljon kiitosta. Suosittelisin kyllä!

2260,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4859658-kathleen-talbot,Rating 5 out of 5,Loved this book! Really beautiful. I listened to the audible version and Tom Hanks is outstanding with the narration. I loved Maeve and Danny and their relationship. This book is really something special. 
2261,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32471242-adelaide-silva,Rating 3 out of 5,"3,5* Uma saga familiar. Várias opiniões dividem este livro, uns gostam da capa, outros nem por isso. Uns acham o enredo espectacular, a outros não agrada tanto, eu pessoalmente gostei da capa, do enredo esperava mais mas é uma leitura fácil "
2262,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31244838-carly-holmes,Rating 4 out of 5,"At the end of WWII a man bought a lavish home called “The Dutch House,” for his young family. What happened after is told over five decades through the point of view of his son, Danny. I have mixed feelings. I really struggled for the first 2/3rds of this book. Once I shifted my focus away from Danny and more on the relationship between him and Maeve I found it much more endearing. Honestly, it was the ending that made me enjoy it so much. That last chapter? I found myself unexpectedly crying. The love between Danny and Maeve was so well written. I’m not sure who I would ever recommend this to. It’s a hard book to get started. But I’m glad I read it and have a soft place in my heart for it."
2263,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/95793868-maya,Rating 4 out of 5,"In The Dutch House, Patchett masterfully and fearlessly explores the complexities of family and relationships as those involved process trauma and dysfunction. I was utterly overwhelmed by the quiet climb to emotional crescendo...stunning!"
2264,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/133293166-mia-mattern,Rating 4 out of 5,"Honestly made me really sad… i don’t know if that was the intention but the emphasis on nostalgia especially nostalgia tied to a physical environment… yea…felt that. Their relationship with their mother… just made me sad. Really good book, super interesting characters and family dynamic just… sad."
2265,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/143522837-katelyn,Rating 4 out of 5,"i am crying while writing this!this was a really incredible story highlighting the complexities of family, sibling dynamics, loss and abandonment, grief, and forgiveness. ann patchett is a gifted storyteller. READ THIS!"
2266,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/123819816-hannah-albee,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5- I totally agree with Meraf’s review. It started off really strong, but as the book went on it felt like it lost focus. Also, I don’t usually mind time jumps when they’re employed effectively, but they felt kind of arbitrary and random here. I enjoyed it but it did sadly become a bit of a slog "
2267,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/101482279-christie-c,Rating 3 out of 5,Maybe 3.5. I did enjoy it a fair bit.Good things:- very interesting personalities- empathy created- cracking audiobook narration by Tom Hanks Bad things:- plot seemed to peter out - didn’t always believe in the characters’ actions
2268,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76153374-steve-hornsby,Rating 4 out of 5,A well written story of family dynamics that’s been sitting on my “to read” shelf for a couple of years since my other half made it her book of the year. I thought the flash forwards and flash backs worked well. There were a few unexpected twists. It reminded me a bit of To The Lighthouse. 
2269,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20171277-niki-cooper,Rating 5 out of 5,"This was a good time to read this book. The content covered misfortune, but I found it oddly calming and comforting. Just an overview of the lives of two sibling. Not much happened beyond the aging of them but I liked how the book was written and I liked the characters. Yeah, they made me roll my eyes but I could connect with them. "
2270,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/72713489-jessica-woodring,Rating 4 out of 5,"This was probably the saddest book that I’ve ever read that I didn’t cry while reading. Soooo, it was sad but I guess not sad enough to affect me emotionally 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️ The book was beautifully written, but tragic to the point that at times it was just frustrating. The theme of forgiveness ran throughout, but the culmination of everything at the end really made it shine.  "
2271,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/111836106-regan-murphy,Rating 3 out of 5,It was giving Cinderella but also with much less follow your dreams and rise above the past. I don’t think that they should’ve forgiven their mother as they did even though life is too short to hold grudges but something about being abandoned feels justified
2272,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64478017-robyn,Rating 4 out of 5,"I really enjoyed this book. It took a little bit to get into, but once the story got going, I found myself thinking about the characters when I wasn't reading the book. I wanted to pick it up in the evenings to find out what was happening to them. This book is told from the perspective of Danny as he goes through adulthood, his relationship with his sister, and their connection to their childhood home and childhood memories and how those things affect their present moments. It was my second Ann Patchett....the first being Commonwealth(which I didn't love as much), but this one makes me want to pick up another one of her novels. "
2273,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7328233-jennifer,Rating 5 out of 5,I would give this book 10 stars if I could. I have no words right now to describe how I feel about it.
2274,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4667439-kim,Rating 5 out of 5,I read the first half of The Dutch House in one day and the second half over a week. This is the kind of book that you're sad to finish because you're not ready to let these people go.
2275,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4321616-jamie,Rating 4 out of 5,"The struggle of parents to protect and care for their children in the face of their own, selfish choices resonated for me in Ann Patchett’s new book. Maeve and Danny’s resilience and their abiding love for each other saved them. I loved this book. "
2276,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4091674-linda,Rating 5 out of 5,My absolute favorite book by this award-winning author. She's truly outdone herself this time. It's so terrific that I will list it as one of my favorite books of 2019! 
2277,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5615007-troy-lindeman-wyner,Rating 5 out of 5,"Patchett effortlessly weaves the past, present, and future into a mesmerizing narrative. "

2285,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64570822-alice-malahova,Rating 5 out of 5,"4.5. I think everyone in his life has its own Dutch House - something that changed your stable life paths, something which you hate and love simultaneously, something that you will never forget until you forgive. That’s what about this book is for me. I liked it a lot. "
2286,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9819047-julia,Rating 3 out of 5,"I loved Patchett's BEL CANTO when I read it almost twenty years ago. Since then, I've read a number of her books but I have never liked any of those as much. This might be my last Ann Patchett. It jumps around with no sense of organization and is way too wordy - you can tell she was at Iowa and has an MFA. But everyone else seems to love this book, so I'm in the minority here."
2287,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15765676-anna,Rating 5 out of 5,No surprise the newest release from my favorite author was a hit.

2289,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17334972-ashley-brooks,Rating 5 out of 5,"A loving story of siblings and growing up in a world not of your choosing. Making a life that, if not perfect, is at least your own on your own terms."

2293,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4062324-melanie,Rating 5 out of 5,Ugh I enjoyed this book almost too much. The characters are perfect the story exquisite. 
2294,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/79497834-kathy-perez,Rating 4 out of 5,Good entertaining book. A sad display of a family that was torn apart early on...and the devastating effects parents have on their children. I liked the storyteller and her style.
2295,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50274525-abby-s,Rating 5 out of 5,"Threads in this book: family ties, forgiveness, and place. I loved the bond of these siblings and how their childhood home was weight they carried throughout their lives."
2296,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2233856-krista,Rating 4 out of 5,Audio book is a must. Tom Hanks is wonderful!! I listen to many books and this was one of the best !
2297,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1011712-cassie,Rating 5 out of 5,One of the most intimate books I've ever read. I loved everything about it. It shows so well how the past lives on in our experiences. Brilliant. I feel like I know Maeve and Danny and I miss them!

2305,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28594550-samar-reads-x1f48c,Rating 3 out of 5,This was okay. Just okay. The characters were blah. I dunno just didn’t feel attached to them.Though i really loved the narration by Tom Hanks. Probably the only thing that kept me going.
2306,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5905770-monica-snyder,Rating 5 out of 5,When the house is so critical to the story it becomes a character I’m all in! Ann writes characters you want to know and you never forget. The strength of sibling love born from enduring adversity together as children is just one of the things I love about this book. 
2307,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/96813296-melanie,Rating 5 out of 5,"I listened to the audio book narrated by Tom Hanks. Captivating story of strong bonds, love and repeated loss where the house is an important character in the story! Loved it!"
2308,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38674288-mel-mynightsbooked,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5 stars. I listened to this on audio and absolutely loved the narration by Tom Hanks. This is a highly character driven novel and the plot moves slow, if at all. Focused around a brother and sister, their childhood home, and their relationships with their loved ones and each other."
2309,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1451470-michele,Rating 4 out of 5,Can we just talk about the cover? Do people realize the power of a fantastic cover? This one has it and I couldn’t stop looking at it. Found it haunting and elegant all at the same time. Great story inside too.

Excellent. I prefer a book in hand, and this was my first time listening to a narrative; it brought a different dynamic to the story."
2313,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5817790-steve,Rating 5 out of 5,"Loved the book. About growing up, growing older, family, memory, forgiveness. I’ve liked other Patchett books but I think this is my favorite so far."

2315,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10289073-loriann-summers,Rating 4 out of 5,The best part of the audiobook is that it’s read by Tom Hanks and the story is interesting. Enjoyable commute to work listening to Tom tell an interesting story!

2319,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4402556-kellie-smith,Rating 5 out of 5,This is a very character-driven book. Don’t expect too much plot. There is not much. It’s about a family. It’s about a brother and sister and a house that ties them all together. I loved this book so much. I highly recommend you listen to the Audible version narrated by Tom Hanks. Superb. I wish he could narrate all the books.

2327,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33570628-ms-arca,Rating 4 out of 5,"I’m not a big audio book person at all. But you must do this book as an audiobook. Tom Hanks, how do you do this so well?! This was magnificent reading. (I wonder if Tom Hanks listens to his own audiobooks and can hear how he rocked it?? I think definitely.) Thoroughly enjoyed this.3/28/20 note as this is one of many of my recent reads where this is the case — there are no POC at all in this book. So just be prepared (even when cruising around NY!?) to be in total white people land for this book. Just worth knowing so you’re in the mood for whitelandia. "
