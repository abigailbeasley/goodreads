But please go and order an audiobook because TOM HANKS is fantastic, impeccable, meticulous narrator. (Yes, he is our Danny boy). So as a result paperback version: 4 stars Audiobook: 5 stars Let’s rounded 4.5 up to 5 celebration of master story telling stars!I started to read the book and I was about to give four stars ! Please, don’t get me wrong, I love the writing and those vivid characters, I was about to give million slaps to one of them: Yes, EVIL STEPMOM ANDREA, I’m talking about you! But slow pace and too many jumping between time lines a little exhausted me. But as soon as I learned Tom Hanks is on the board, I stopped reading and I started listening to the book with a huge smile on my face. Danny and Maeve will always stay on my mind and heart as amazing siblings. Their mother abandoned them. (Actually she was another version of Mother Theresa and she rejected to live in a mansion when too many poor people suffer out there so she left the place. She still loved her husband and she didn’t intend to leave her children. Her belief as social responsibilities always come first even it means to neglect her own family is irritated me so much! I’m not quite fan of this character. But thanks God, we have evil stepmother to hate more!) And their father passed away when he was only 53. They both lost their parents at young age but what they didn’t know they would be also homeless with great scheme her stepmother dearest had planned details with her lawyer. She got the control of the business of their father and she got the Dutch House to live with her two daughters. So she kicked her step kids out. She even tried to prevent Danny take money from trust fund for his education because Danny chose an expensive school and her own daughters couldn’t get the highest education they need, if all the money would spend for Danny’s needs. (At least her attempts were stopped by their father’s lawyer this time. I think Andrea deserved a special place in hell but in my opinion, hell would be like a spa treatment for her!) So all the losses they suffered, keep united this brother and sister against the entire world. They became each other’s priorities and supported each other for every big life decisions. (Maeve helped him to connect with his future wife even they didn’t get along for a long time and resented each other!) They grew up, but they resumed going to the Dutch House and stopped their cars in front of the place, waited to see any activity around or inside and they left. THAT BECAME THEIR ROUTINE FOR YEARS like visiting an old relative they check randomly to make sure she’ still alive!Years passed, they got old. They resumed going back there…Till one day their mother returned back and requested them to drive her to the house and finally she bangs on the door to meet with Andrea. That is the beginning of some endings! The house was like a living and functioning organism marked the milestones of the sibling’s lives and changed them forever. Past and future combined with sadness, regrets, resentments, sister and brother’s devotion, marriage, nostalgia, childhood memories, unfinished businesses, yearning for real and functional family, life decisions.  As the life moved on , two siblings’ a special piece of their hearts always stayed with that house, buried there, even they thought they moved on but they couldn’t. Because house gave them hope that one day their mother could return. House made them grow up earlier. House made them connect with their maids, nanny ( also mistress of their father) and many childhood happy memories. Even they’ve kicked out, they have never left the place and the house never left them, too. It left a vulnerable scar on their mind and soul. It always stayed with them till the end of their lives.Amazing story-telling, remarkable characterization and best narration!bloginstagramfacebooktwitter"
1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30181442-yun,Rating 3 out of 5," The Dutch House starts out strong, but then ultimately doesn't go anywhere.We are introduced to siblings Danny and Maeve, the center of this family saga. Their father strikes it rich and buys a lavish mansion known as The Dutch House as a surprise for their mother. That event reverberates with repercussions for everyone in the family and kicks off a five decade long story.This is my first Ann Patchett, and I've heard amazing things about her, so I tore into this book with gusto. And I was hooked from the first page. I found the characters and the writing to be riveting and was thoroughly enthralled with where this story was going. But then about a third of the way into it, a big turning point happened. And after that, well, I didn't really see the point of the story anymore. The writing remained interesting, but the characters and their actions stopped making sense to me. The story kind of fizzled out and then limped along without a clear narrative for the rest of the book.Usually, even if I don't connect with a story, I can still guess what the author is trying to say. But in this case, I'm stumped. Perhaps it's the message that forgiveness is key no matter how egregious the wrong? But that doesn't make sense to me, so I honestly don't know.The writing is still compelling enough that it helped carry the story through to the end, so I was never bored. But the last two thirds shambled along without momentum or purpose, and was utterly forgettable. It feels like I read a short story that reached its conclusion and then continued on for 200 more meandering pages."
2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1151637-roxane,Rating 4 out of 5,"This was an absorbing read even though the narrator was infuriating, self-absorbed, oblivious, selfish, and annoying. It follows two siblings, Danny and Maeve, and their childhood home, The Dutch House, across decades with a mother who disappeared, an emotionally distant father, his new wife and her daughters and, eventually, Danny’s wife and children. There is an epic feel to this novel but it is also an intimate portrait of siblings who have found home in each other when they are failed by the adults who were supposed to nurture them. Patchett is a formidable novelist. She takes such care with her storytelling. She creates an indelible sense of place and the narrative does some interesting things with chronology. "
3,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4685500-angela-m,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5 starsSometimes in a novel, a place is such a strong and integral part of the story that it deserves as much attention as if it were a character. The house in this novel exerts so much influence over the lives of the characters, sometimes more so than the other people in their lives. The house, with its big windows and ornate design is a symbol of success for Cyril Conroy, the self made real estate developer. To his wife Elna, it is everything that is wrong with the world, when so many others have nothing. To their children, Maeve and Danny, it is where they live. As adults, it’s much more complex; it represents everything they lost. To Conroy’s second wife Andrea, it’s a possession she has to have. Narrated by Danny, the story moves back and forth from their childhood over decades, a family saga of sorts, but the Conroy family for most of the novel is just the two of them, Danny and Maeve. This is in so many ways about the past, the past they can’t let go of, the past that shapes who they become as adults. “Do you think it’s possible to ever see the past as it actually was?” Danny asks his sister Maeve. “ I see the past as it actually was,” Maeve said. Danny responds “ But we overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know, so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.” ** It’s also about sibling love and sacrifice as the brilliant Maeve gives up so much of her life to care for Danny, to make sure he is okay. I was so emotionally connected to them and I loved their relationship. It was at times heartbreaking to see how deep seated these wounds of the past are for both of them .The plot, which captured me from the beginning is one the reader should discover for themselves, so no spoilers here. The bottom line is that I loved pretty much everything about the book - the writing, the characters, the story. I found it nearly perfect and it is 4.5 stars because of something in the end that I found hard to reconcile. I keep a list of favorite writers and Ann Patchett has been on that list for quite a while now. I’ve read every novel she’s published. Her characters always feel fully developed and making an emotional connection is easy because she allows us to know them. Definitely recommended! I read this with Diane and Esil as one of our ongoing buddy reads and as always appreciate their thoughts.**Quotes are from the advanced copy.I received an advanced copy of this book from HarperCollins through Edelweiss."
4,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5211606-julie-g,Rating 3 out of 5,"Reading Road Trip 2020Current location: Pennsylvania“Swear to God, you really were that boring.”The night my book club discussed Ann Patchett's Bel Canto some ten years ago, I clutched my copy of that novel to my chest like a companion animal and huffed and puffed away, defensively, every time a woman in the group grumbled “so unbelievable” and “that ending!” Who were they, those wenches, to speak ill of a book I adored about love and opera? Later, on various telephone calls, my sister (another devoted reader and reviewer) frequently gave the beast a poke, belaboring, yet again, my recommendation of Bel Canto to her. Why had I recommended this far flung tale of messy plot points and undeveloped characters to her?Harrumph.Then came the night at book club when we discussed Patchett's State of Wonder. I was so stricken with jungle love, I was practically sitting there with my Pinot Noir, burning up with malaria. When one of the ladies mentioned the COMPLETELY IMPLAUSIBLE ending, I felt a small flutter of doubt in my heart. . . yes, it's true, the ending was bad, but, but, but. . . The jungle! Okay, there was the scene with that kid and that scene on the dock that made absolutely no sense, but, but. . . The jungle!So, I started The Dutch House with a big smile on my face. I even purchased a new hardcover copy (almost unheard of for me), and jumped right in to Patchett's characteristically readable prose and her memorable one-liners.Oooooh, a mansion! Well, that's as appealing as an opera house or a jungle that holds the promise of sex!But the doubts came quickly with this one. Why were the two protagonists, siblings Maeve and Danny, just sitting outside the house like two cardboard cutouts? Why weren't we ever getting inside their heads, instead of having the story narrated TO US? Was I ever going to know these two people? Was this, like, a play?Wait, wait. . . why were they still sitting there, but two pages ago they were teens and now one is married and the other is graduated and working now. Wait, wait. . . he has kids? But I never even knew him to kiss a girl! Was this, like, a play about time travel?And then. . . when the 53-year-old father, Cyril Conroy, dies and leaves his two motherless children without a will. . . well, folks, I CRIED FOUL. I looked right at my book and declared NO.Not only was Cyril Conroy a REAL ESTATE MOGUL worth God knows how much money, one of his best friends was a LAWYER who not only had drawn up a very detailed educational trust for his kids. . . but Mr. Conroy, being the owner of so many buildings in Pennsylvania and New York, was, in fact, so legally minded, that he once “paid a man from the American consulate to meet [their mother's] ship in Bombay. He'd mailed the divorce papers and the man took my mother straight to the consulate and had her sign them in front of a notary.” And, get this, the next line is: “ALL VERY LEGAL.” (page 288, in case you're interested in details)Cyril Conroy was known for being a stickler, the type of man who crossed his “i's” and dotted his “t's.” This was not a man who would be remiss in having his lawyer draw up a very thorough will for his motherless children.To quote Maeve from the book: “Did that really happen?”To quote Danny from the book: “Are you making this up?”As far as I am concerned, the entire premise of this story is tragically flawed, right from the start. The novel, in my opinion, also makes the mistake of being approximately 100 pages too long, and suffers from almost no real character development. As readers, we are TOLD everything, like a Greek tragedy, narrated aloud. We SEE almost nothing here, but two mannequins sitting in a car, exchanging some clever dialogue.I will tell you this: I will not be the reader with stars in her eyes, when my book club discusses this one."
5,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38610813-paromjit,Rating 4 out of 5,"Ann Patchett's latest novel proves to be a absolute delight to read with its echoes of the darkest of fairytales with the requisite wicked stepmother in the form of Andrea. We are provided with Patchett's acute understanding and keen observational insights of what it is to be human, the complex nature of family and the dysfunctional dynamics that proliferate. Shortly after WW2, Cyril Conroy's life catapults from poverty into wealth which propels him to buy the architectural jewel that is the Dutch House with its many windows in the Pennsylvania suburbs for his wife, Elna, a house that is to splinter his family apart. As the narrative moves back and forth in time through five decades, the house turns out to be an integral part and trigger for the dramas that ensue, the highs and the lows. Danny grew up with little memory of his mother who left so early in his life, and his father is a distant figure, contributing to the strong bond with his older sister, the bright and determined Maeve, a woman of substance who takes on the mantle of caring and protecting him. Cyril brings Andrea into the lives of Maeve and Danny, and goes on to marry her. Andrea, with her children, is driven by ambition that inform her behaviour and decisions, catalysts for how events pan out in the house and family interactions until Cyril's dies, leaving Andrea with everything. Andrea reacts by throwing Maeve and Danny out. The siblings are pushed out of their privileged and comfortable lives, finding themselves facing a life of poverty and challenges with only each other to rely on. Maeve dedicates her life to Danny at the expense of her own life and ambitions, with both positive and negative outcomes, although their future lives are to be shaped by their constant obsession with the house and their inability to let go of the past.Patchett writes a compulsive novel of family, sibling relationships, secrets, memories that can so often turn out to be unreliable, coming to terms with what life can throw at you, grief, loss, love and forgiveness. It is beautifully written, with rich, atmospheric vibrant descriptions and with Patchett's stellar and skilful characterisation and development, she has an uncanny capacity to give us pictures of emotional and meaningful depth of her characters interior lives. This is a brilliant, thought provoking, multilayered, complicated and well crafted book infused with a wryness and humour that made it such a memorable read. Many thanks to Bloomsbury for an ARC."
6,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32879029-emma,Rating 4 out of 5,"Hang on, I swear I’m about to write this review, but first I need to call up every real estate agent in the greater Philadelphia area and inquire about purchasing the Dutch House.Okay, so yes, the Dutch House is fictional.Plan B: I will make millions and millions of dollars and then become best friends with Ann Patchett and she and I will team up as co-architects to construct a real life version, and both of us will ignore the fact that we have no architecture experience and that I haven’t taken an actual math class in about 6 years (long story) and also that the Dutch House as a literary symbol brings only suffering and obsession.I’m sure I’ll figure it out. I’m an English major, so according to my calculations, making millions of dollars will take me...476 years.We’ve got time.Until then, I will think about this book. To keep me motivated and inspired.I will think about how it is beautifully written, and so real and emotive and human, and how I FELT everything that happened in this book. How it all felt real and painful and true.I will think about how I love Maeve, and I love Danny, and I love May and Kevin and Celeste, and I love Sandy and Jocelyn, and how I even love Norma and Bright.Mostly, I will think about the Dutch House, and the borderline grotesque beauty of the dining room, and the big portraits in the living room, and the windowseat in the best bedroom, and the seating area at the top of the stairs, and the warm kitchen, and the cold high-up beds.And those 476 years will just fly by.Bottom line: Immediately after finishing this book, I resolved to read everything by Ann Patchett.----------------pre-reviewactually i grew up in the Dutch House and the characters from this book are my family and this is the story of my life.review to come / 4.5 stars----------------tbr reviewi promise eventually i'll move on from gazing lovingly at this cover and actually open this book"
7,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11296522-fatma,Rating 2 out of 5,"3 stars if im feeling generous, which im not, so 2.5 stars it isthis was so blah. no word encapsulates this book for me more perfectly than ""blah."" i recognize that this book had some nice, touching moments, but on the whole it felt so heartless. after about the first quarter of this book, this started becoming very apparent. the dutch house reminded me of all the things i disliked about mary beth keane's ask again, yes and jhumpa lahiri's the namesake: the reliance on having a character tell us the plot as opposed to us seeing it unfold; the huge time jumps that leave characters in the most boring, cookie-cutter lives, in stark contrast to their initially compelling childhoods. like i dont know how many times i have to read about time jumps where interesting characters end up married to some wishy-washy character whose only function is to be of the opposite sex so that the main character can get married to them and have the compulsory 2 kids and white picket fence. can we not think of literally anything that's more interesting ? like anything ? ill even take 3 kids instead of the usual 2. WRITERS, PLEASE, TRY HARDERit goes without saying that where the first quarter of this book was compelling for me, the other two-thirds completely lost me. what i was invested in were the family dynamics, the brother-sister relationship. what i was not invested in was seeing danny take college courses and hang out with his (painfully boring) girlfriend and do random real-estate things that i could not care less about. (and by the way, celeste's whole character just reeked of the ""im not like other girls"" trope. i know she's peripheral to the story, but she's never her own character, not even a little bit. she exists exclusively in relation to and for danny.) i also didnt really think that the characters' motivations made all that much sense. andrea was barely anything much more than an Evil, Gold Digging Step Mom. and all the animosity between celeste and maeve felt extremely unfounded, not to mention very annoying.reading this book was just one long downward trajectory. the more i read it the more it irritated me till finally at the end i was like okay i definitely dont like this book."
8,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse-walters,Rating 5 out of 5,"E-book - ( own)... and Audiobook.... ( own), narrated by Tom Hanks. Having read and loved other books by Patchett, [“Commwealth”, “Bel Canto”, “State of Wonder”, “This Is The Story of A Happy Marriage”, and “Run”], plus all the raving early reviews - I was looking forward to reading this. And now I’ve joined the choir with other readers and friends singing....“This is a wonderful novel”. I pre-ordered the ebook months ago - soon to learn that my High School boyfriend- [haha]- Tommy Hanks - was reading the Audiobook....so I purchased the Audiobook as well. TOM HANKS was FLAWLESS in reading this novel. Man, he made this book come alive!!! Tom was so darn good - it was easy to be fooled that he was reading his own memoir. Mixing a gifted author with the enormously talented actor, is like finding a FRUIT LOOP in a bowl of CHEERIOS.....( Danny did eat Cheerios for breakfast in this story).Tom Hanks, as narrator, ( cast as Danny Conroy ), delivers Ann Patchett’s novel’s as if he ‘is’ Danny. Hank disappears - and what we are left with is this bright, funny, kid/guy: Danny!!Danny’s devotion to his sister, Maeve, (7 years older than him), is deeply moving. Their relationship is major and memorable. Danny was innocent - uniformed - unenlightened - incognizant in ways - yet when it came to his sister, Maeve, he knew more about her than anyone. He was always looking at her - observing her - loving her - immensely loyal to her. “The story of my sister, was the only story I was meant to tell”....says Danny. “The Dutch House” is a brother-sister psychodrama about wealth, loss of family, sibling loyalty, anger, desire, resentment, love, forgiveness, etc. Danny and Maeve grew up in a luxurious mansion outside of Philadelphia, known as the Dutch House.....(named for previous owners cigarette moguls of Dutch heritage). The details of the house - the descriptions of the rooms - the cook & housekeeper - the family complexities- of mother - father - stepmother - siblings - wives - sickness - college - marriage - divorce - emotional attachments - abandonment - sadness - hope -past & future - is exquisitely impactful. As the story moves along, the house feels like another character. I came to see ‘the house’ as synonymous with family - heartbreaks-and heartwarming. Patchett’s storytelling is bighearted and smart. It’s one of those books that seems to be alive.... with a beating heartbeat. Ann Patchett is an expert at exploring psychological depths beneath the surface of her characters. Every character was easy to imagine. Ann Patchett shared what sparked her narrative for ‘The Dutch House’. She said.... “The Book really started with me thinking about a person who didn’t want to be rich. There’s so much celebration around money, and I thought, ‘what if somebody just wanted to walk away from it all?’ I began thinking about the repercussions of one person‘s decision — how one person‘s decision really changes the path of so many lives. When Danny and Maeve lost the house, she couldn’t get over it. And I think that’s true for a lot of us. Something has happened in our lives, and even if our lives go on to be quite wonderful, we hang on to the hurt.”5 fabulous stars! "
9,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63168028-peter,Rating 4 out of 5,"AttachedThe Dutch House is a story of siblings, Danny and Maeve Conroy, their obsessive connection with the iconic family house they lived in as young children and how their lives unfolded over the years. The story is narrated by Danny over multiple non-linear time periods. The various time jumps and reflections back to important events felt like a jigsaw puzzle being built, where there is the uncertainty of the next piece but once it is placed, the complete picture becomes clearer and clearer. This is a wonderful skill Ann Patchett possesses as I never feel lost or confused as she managed the time transitions so deftly. The other major hallmark of Ann Patchett is her development of amazing characters and relationships. Maeve is Danny’s older sister of 7 years, she is very intelligent, a diabetic, caring to the extreme for her brother, and a character that fascinates and frustrates at times. Danny is much more emotionally reserved and his development into adulthood is interesting to watch. While he takes advantage of top-class education in medicine he can’t shake his love for his father’s business in real estate. Their mother is a memory, having left them when they were young and the story starts with their father bringing Andrea home to visit. Andrea eventually becomes his wife, their new mother and the force that shapes the future relationships within the family.
 “Mothers were the measure of safety, which meant that I was safer than Maeve. After our mother left, Maeve took up the job on my behalf but no one did the same for her.” 
 It’s not too long before Andrea's own two daughters become her sole focus and ambition, and the existing family and staff are unwelcome reminders of a past she wasn’t part of. Andrea is dispassionate, harsh, and greedy, and heir to the Dutch House mansion. Early in the marriage “It also seemed pretty clear he had married the wrong woman. If we all kept to our own corners it was easier for everyone.”After only a few years of marriage, their father dies and leaves the house and business to Andrea who repays his memory by putting both Maeve and Danny out, to never set foot in their home again. This starts an obsessive periodic pilgrimage for Danny and Maeve where they return to the street to sit in a car parked across from the Dutch House and gaze at it recalling memories and wondering how life would have panned out – if only. The emotional baggage they carry together drives them forward but also restricts their successes and paths taken. The psychological burden of seeking happiness and fulfilment, while tied to past commitments and motivations is cleverly layered throughout the story.What I had difficultly with was that I didn’t feel any great pace in the novel and at times wished it would move along in a more compelling rate. The house, while a connecting point, didn’t really have any character and increasingly the story is told away from it. It may be suggested that the house is the central aspect of the story but I would disagree feeling it more appropriate to consider the deep, caring, loving and supportive relationship between a brother and sister growing up with only each other to depend on and if that connection in itself had a restricting effect on how their lives developed. Their real mother returns to the story very late in the book and I just found her motivations, and supposed wisdom, very difficult to accept and jarred so much that it left a frustration with the novel.I would recommend this book and I’d like to thank Bloomsbury Publishing and NetGalley for providing me with an early ARC copy in return for an honest review."

11,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/260116-janb-vacation-and-off-line-till-mid-october,Rating 3 out of 5,"2.5 stars:Danny and Maeve are siblings who can’t overcome their past. Abandoned by their mother at an early age, Maeve, the oldest, assumes the mother role. Everything changes further when their emotionally distant father marries the evil stepmother and the children are cut out of their inheritance. The pain, bitterness, and anger shapes their personalities and their future. How do they move past such a childhood? My questions: What does forgiveness look like? Does forgiveness mean you allow toxic people back into your life? Is that healthy? What is required of the person(s) who did you wrong? I have my own thoughts about these issues but you’ll have to read the book and decide for yourself. Commonwealth is one of my favorite books and this was one of my most anticipated books of the year. The first 75% was riveting reading. But the story took a turn that I found unrealistic and ridiculous. I can’t say more without spoilers but I’m glad I could vent to my reading buddy Marialyce. I’ve tried to discern the author’s purpose in writing this book and it either escapes me or it’s one I can’t buy into. * I received a copy of the book via Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review* for our duo review of this and other books please visit https://yayareadslotsofbooks.wordpres..."
12,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1277371-marialyce-back-in-the-usa,Rating 2 out of 5,"This was a book I had to think about after finishing. I truly wanted to fall into a deep and abiding love for the story and yet I found it so unrealistic that I had to question what if any was the motive behind the story. There seemed to be no overwhelming meaning to the characters. Everyone and everything seemed disjointed and to me a wash of grey characters, not believable and certainly not ones to be emulated. From the dereliction of being a mother, a father who is in all intents absentee, to the relationship of brother and sister and a step family, I could not get a firm grasp on what the author was trying to say. It was a big disappointment for I am one to accept stories with messages not however messages that are murky if not obscure. It was like going on a roller coaster waiting for the biggest and tallest hill and then there was none. Left to a stilted somewhat boring ride, you emerge with no sense of wonder but a sense of what the heck was that and where was my thrill?So here I will sit with a not so favorable outlook on this story. I have liked three of this author's books, particularly the book, Commonwealth, but unfortunately for me this book left be feeling as vacant and bereft as her characters seemed to be. 2.5 stars for me as well. What represents you as a person? Is it the people you know, the clothes you wear, or even the house you live in? Could it be in one's zeal to be acknowledged that the aforementioned things are really what makes the persona a person wishes to put forward. What happens to character, to strength, and to the willingness to help others, particularly family, as the components of what makes a person? In this book, Ann Patchett presents us with a family whose lives are tragic shells of what could have been. But is that enough to know, for in every tragedy there always emerges victors and perhaps in this book there are no victors whatsoever just losers in the game of life.

13,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4125660-liz,Rating 5 out of 5,"5 HUGE STARS! One of my best of 2019 (definitely the best audio book). I am a huge Ann Patchett fan and this book does not disappoint. It’s a fabulous book, but it was made so much better because of Tom Hank’s narration. The book is described as a dark fairy tale and there is definitely that theme, with an evil stepmother separating two siblings from their father, their house and everything they hold dear. The book just drew me in and I wanted to spend all my hours listening to it. Told from Danny’s viewpoint, we learn of how Andrea appears in their lives and usurps their inheritance. While I appreciated what Maeve and Danny had lost, I also kept waiting to see when they would move on with their lives. As time goes on, and it moves through five decades, the book becomes more about forgiveness and acceptance. While Maeve is often bitter, Danny at times just seems befuddled, a somewhat removed player in his own life. My thoughts about Celeste went back and forth. Maeve and Danny were so used to being each other’s emotional support, I could understood Celeste feeling left out. But her jealousy at times felt childish. Patchett’s strength comes from how she forms her characters. I never felt Danny and Maeve were anything but real flesh and blood people. In both cases, you see exactly how their childhood has made them the people they are. The same events, when seen through the difference of a few years, shapes them in unique ways. And that ending! I loved how this played out and what became of each of the main characters, how they reconciled themselves to their histories. What surprised me was how much humor was in this book. Not laugh out loud, but a subtle, dry humor that more closely mirrors real life. Again, Hanks totally captures the humor here. I hope he takes on more audio book assignments as he is so well suited to the work."
14,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s,Rating 4 out of 5,"Patchett is way up there on my, can't wait for next novel, list. Her characterizations, her insight into flawed families and her wry observations of human nature, are always top notched. In this, her soon to be published novel, she follows a family for five decades, a family that is broken apart, for reasons that I cannot at this time share. Brother and sister, Maeve and Danny, are extremely close, not unexpected since they are the only ones that are there for each other through thick and thin. Danny is our narrator, and from a young age, we are let into his thoughts and the actions of the other characters.Dutch House, a house that their father bought to surprise their mother, is as much a character in this story, as are the actual characters. It is the cause of much of what happens here, a house with huge window that allows one to see all through the house. We follow not only the house itself, but the brother and sister as they grow, through their triumphs and losses. Sibling strength and family loyalty.It is a novel of obsession but also of acceptance and forgiveness. The end, in a way comes full circle, but not without much heartache and loss. There were a few things that sparked the doubting Thomas in me, but all in all this is a wonderful read.Another read with Angela and Esil, and though our ratings do differ a bit, we all enjoyed this novel.ARC by Edelweiss."

I am not sure I will follow her, but this novel is absolutely fantastic. What an intriguing idea to tell a story of a family, especially of a strong bond between siblings, and connect it with a story of a house that seems to be in the background but which in fact plays the major role in the characters' lives! I live in a flat in a tenement house which was built over 90 years ago, love everything about it, appreciate the amount of work that went into decorting it and the attention to its quality, therefore the Dutch House at first seemed to me one of the most beautiful houses one can imagine. At the beginning I was confused: how can you hate such an architectural pearl? As the story progresses, we learn more about its former owners, how the Conroys came to own it, how Danny and Maeve were forced to leave it, and most importantly, how it influenced their mother and in consequence, the siblings. Then, I understood Ms Patchett's idea behind her story. And I loved it.For me, this was one of those novels that you start and you think you know what to expect, and then you are given a most unannounced treat."

I previously had only read Commonwealth and liked it, but it wasn't something I would climb to the top of a mountain and yell about. This book is.I'm not going to get into the summary because I went in as blind as I could (I requested an ARC on NG and EW purely on the fact that it was Ann Patchett and I LOVED the cover) and I think that benefited me. I had no expectations whatsoever. Within the first few pages I was hooked. Ms. Patchett's beautiful writing had my jaw on the floor. I am in awe of her talent and it played out so well in my mind that I was in that house with them. I was sitting next to them in the car. I was the fly on the wall. I was there.If you like books that make you feel a spectrum of emotions with a side of laughter for a few quirky characters - than this book is absolutely a MUST READ. I experienced being vehemently angry, to laughing out loud to such utter sadness...If this isn't made into a series on TV or a movie, I don't know what is wrong with people. The characters in this story (my favorite is Maeve hands down) are so complex and relatable and REAL. You hate them, you forgive them, you desperately love them. I cannot say enough good things about it. I love books that make me feel something and this one did, a million times over. Thank you to Edelweiss, Harpercollins and Ann Patchett for the opportunity to read and provide an honest review of this book.Review Date: 09/27/19Publication Date: 09/24/19"

This one is read by Tom Hanks and he makes it absolutely perfect. He has the kind of voice you can listen to for hours and it is ideal for Danny, the character whose point of view is followed throughout the book.The story is about the breakdown of a family and the support its individual members give to each other. Danny and his sister Maeve are the most important characters, and they have an amazing bond. I thought it was very interesting to observe the different ways they reacted to their lost mother. Maeve, who had known her for some of her childhood, longed for her return. Danny, who never really knew her, ended up being very like his father and repeated many of his faults. I have read several of this author's books now and have enjoyed all of them. She has a magic touch with characterisation and her books often read like top quality memoirs because the people in them are so real. The Dutch House is not plot driven or exciting. It moves slowly and beautifully and ends up almost where it began. I enjoyed it very much."
19,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7383561-holly,Rating 4 out of 5,"TOM HANKS NARRATES THIS AUDIOBOOK! I repeat, Tom Hanks narrates this audiobook! I could listen to that man narrate a grocery list but lucky for us, this book was much more interesting than that.Let me first warn you that this is absolutely a character study plot type novel. And by that I mean, don't go into this book expecting this to happen: beginning->story climax where something major happens->ending. Instead, the readers gets to wade through the lives of Danny and his older sister, Maeve. It's like literary voyeurism. This is something I personally enjoy (I even have a shelf for it!), but if that does not sound like the kind of story you want to read, you might want to skip this.Getting into the book itself - I *loved* the first 2/3 of the book, maybe even 3/4. So, as you can probably figure out, the ending is where I dropped my planned 5 star review down to a 4. I don't want to spoil any of the book, because when a book really isn't about anything in particular everything is a spoiler. But I can say that the ending left me wondering if the author was trying to tell the reader something about forgiveness and if so, I am way too much of a cynical grudge bearing asshole to jump on that forgiveness ship, both in books and in real life. So, there's that.But don't let my personal issues with the book ending dissuade you from LISTENING to this book. Because Tom Hanks. *dreamy sigh while I go watch You've Got Mail for the millionth time*"
20,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8665845-debbie,Rating 4 out of 5,"A grand house with grand siblings insideA house? Really? I want people, not inanimate objects! I thought the house would be bigger than the people in it, but thank god I was wrong. I ended up loving the place. Hell, I’d go to an open house there any day. Damn straight I’d like to snoop around.The cover and the title scared me. A painting of an uptight, upright woman on the cover, and “Dutch House” as the title—sounds like we might have some snooty going on here. Is reading this going to feel like being held prisoner in a museum? Because I’m here to tell you, museums are famous for keeping it dull, and I definitely smelled a museum. It just hit me that I wouldn’t have been putting on the brakes if the house were some funky, colorful place (with a chartreuse washstand and a periwinkle china cabinet)—in other words, a house I’d like to explore. A rich person’s house—high ceilings, mature rugs, huge art? Yawn city. But let’s face it, I would read anything Ann Patchett writes—uptight, upright, museum-y or not, I was all in. So I sighed and dug in, already mad that I was going to be dropped into dens of description! I needed an attitude adjustment, because of course this huge house, as I predicted, was being described in huge detail. Chill! I sat there all tense, poised and ready to jump ship if I had to. But immediately the writing adjusted my attitude, as Patchett did her typical skillful thing and grabbed me into her story. And we’re talking two pages in. I was hooked.This is the story of Danny and Mauve, a brother and sister who are joined at the hip. Danny is the narrator, and he’s just a kid when the story starts. I liked him immediately. Mauve takes care of Danny, and he adores her. All they have, really, is each other. When two siblings are alone against the world, they are imprinted on each other for life; the bond is greater than any other. Danny and Mauve fit the bill. Watching their devotion to each other was so touching. Their lives change suddenly (and the house is big during this fateful moment) and they need each other even more. The book follows them through five decades. As the kids became adults, I got more and more attached to them; I was invested in the choices they made and cringed more than once at their behavior. Patchett knows how to make you believe them, trust them, love them.The house is at first a grand place but all the sudden it isn’t. The house means different things to different people and it’s a constant in the book, always there for people to react to. Throughout the book, we have Danny and Mauve sitting in a car in front of the house, reminiscing. Right there, Patchett has me in the palm of her hand. Why on earth are they just sitting there? Can’t they go in? Why do they sit there time and again? Slowly the story gets revealed.I’ve been a Patchett fan for a long time, and every time I finish one of her books, I feel so completely satisfied (with the exception of Bel Canto). Yet I always sort of frown and try to figure out Patchett’s secret. Well, of course, there’s the fact that her writing is dynamite. And she creates nuanced characters, has a lot of insight into the human condition, and keeps the story moving along, usually rather quietly (there’s never over-the-top melodrama—never). Her presentation is complicated but smooth. We go back and forth in time, but she sets it up in a way that lets me happily accept the jumps.Patchett’s tone is pretty formal, which always puts me off at first because I worry it will keep me from feeling close to the characters; it will create a distance. But here’s the scoop: Maybe I can’t get super close because she’s got a wall up, but she gets me to peek over the wall to see the fascinating party she’s throwing, and it’s as good as a front-row seat. With all of her books, the formality soon becomes invisible to me and I am all in, attached to the characters and wanting to find out, right that minute, how they are going to fare. I desperately wanted to know how Danny’s and Mauve’s life would turn out. The story didn’t disappoint.In terms of scope, tone, setting, and depth, this book seems like a throwback to masterpieces written in the 1700s and 1800s; there is a classic and epic feel to it. Having a grand mansion as the setting helps. As in classics, Patchett does give lots of details of things that by themselves aren’t interesting, but she ends up painting a vivid picture that sets a perfect stage for the action going down, and you feel like you’re right there.This editor twitches a couple of times. There are a few tiny problems, which might be fixed by publication date:-Mauve’s workplace is described twice. Haven’t I read this before?-Kids don’t talk this way! Way too mature-sounding! Happened enough times to annoy me.-Common error: she said she “could have cared less” when she meant that she “couldn’t have cared less.”The reason I’m giving this book 4 stars instead of 5 is that I had trouble believing the mom. I just didn’t think what she did was realistic (plus I bigtime didn’t approve of it). Also, there is a theme of forgiveness at the end, which I also didn’t buy (or like). Even though there isn’t a religious theme going on, I think religion is a very tricky undercurrent.All in all, a good read, though. Patchett is a master.Thanks to Edelweiss for the advance copy."
21,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5872506-larry-h,Rating 4 out of 5,"""But we overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we're not seeing it as the people we were, we're seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.""Siblings Danny and Maeve Conroy grew up in The Dutch House, a lavish home in the Philadelphia suburbs. Once the home of a Dutch family that owned most of the area, their artwork and interior decorating still remain throughout the infamous estate. While their real-estate-investor father loves the house and sees it as a jewel in his empire, their mother was repulsed by all the infamous home represented, and she left when Danny was very young.Left with a father generally incapable of doing more than providing the material comforts for his children, Maeve helped raise Danny, with the help of the family's two housekeepers. The two siblings, despite their age difference, formed an unshakable bond, one which became even more crucial when their father married again, this time a younger woman with two young daughters of her own. Their stepmother's dislike of them was apparent to them from the very start, although their father seemed oblivious and/or disinterested in her treatment of them, as he was more interested in keeping the peace in his household than anything else.When their stepmother gets the opportunity, she exiles Danny and Maeve from the house—and cuts off their access to any of the money that should be theirs. Left with nothing, they are forced to fend for themselves and have only each other to survive. And while they cannot seem to get The Dutch House out of their minds, given that it was such an enormous part of their lives, they want more than anything to understand the actions of their parents, which led them to where they are now. While this isn't a suspenseful book, there are a few surprises that are better to unfold as you read it rather than have them revealed. This is a book that was paced a lot slower than I like, but there is a lot of richness to behold, including emotion, nostalgia, family dynamics, and even a little humor. What fascinated me even more is what a major character the house itself played, much like in

22,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/106692-cheri,Rating 5 out of 5,"4.5 StarsThis is the third book of Patchett’s that I’ve read, the first being State of Wonder,  the second, Commonwealth, and this is one adds to the proof that she was born to write these complex family dramas where each character equally shares the wounds of all involved.  A little like a fairy tale flipped upside-down, this story includes an imposing, castle-like house, which seems to affect each character differently, as though abiding inside these walls seems to create an entirely different relationship between the house and each character. It begins as World War II is ending, and this then poor young family who have been living in base housing, living a happy, if simple life find their world upended when the father, Cyril, buys a house – unbeknownst to his young wife and young daughter, Maeve. The wife, Elna, is… well, impressed by the house, but the impression isn’t a good one, and she can’t imagine how this house could be theirs when they are poor. Something must be wrong beyond her feeling that this is far too ostentatious for her to ever feel comfortable living in. As the story moves along, the house becomes more and more like another character, creating tension as time passes, and representing the failures of the past as well as the shattered hopes and dreams for the members of this family, as well. As time passes, it continues to pull both Danny and his sister Maeve back time and again to confront their feelings of anger and their regrets over the past. Narrated by the son, Danny, it seemed as though these were stories shared by and about real people, and imparted with the grace and dignity offered to cherished loved ones.

23,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3643764-esil,Rating 4 out of 5,"Awfully close to 5 stars!The Dutch House is full of the stuff I love in fiction. It’s really well written, has great characters, is original and feels like a big meaty story I could get lost in. Danny is the narrator. He grew up in the grandiose Dutch House with his sister, Maeve, and his father. What happens to his mother is a mystery that unravels over time. But the fallout from her disappearance is a very strong bond between Danny and Maeve, and a cascade of emotional and other consequences for everyone. At the centre of the novel is the house — loved and reviled depending on the character. In the end, there is a symmetry to the story that is emotionally wrought and complex. This is not an easy story with straightforward characters. But it’s very readable. I read this one as a buddy read with Angela and Diane, and it definitely works well as a buddy read because there’s much to discuss — especially the end. Thanks to Edelweiss and the publisher for an opportunity to read an advance copy."

From the masterful beginning until the perfect ending, and everything in between; the characters who feel like family, the Dutch house itself, the story which loops around and circles in upon itself, surprises, unexpected opportunities and also the letting go of hatred and revenge when there's no point in them anymore. I'm still not sure how I feel about the Mother, but I'll be dwelling on her for quite some time.I don't know exactly how Ann Patchett keeps on getting better and better, but she has taken grand storytelling to a new level."
26,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68708752-beverly,Rating 5 out of 5,"Ann Patchett is one of my favorite authors. I haven't read all of her books, but I have read many of them that I love with my whole heart; Bel Canto, Run, Truth and Beauty are my favorites by her. The Dutch House is a five star read too. I was completely in love with her characters, especially Maeve and her brother Danny, who are essentially made orphans and paupers by the death of their father, the desertion by their mother, and their wicked stepmother who kicks Danny out of her home when he is only 15. Maeve has to take care of Danny and herself and she does an outstanding job. This is a novel about siblings who love each other and take care of each other which is something that is very rare in books.Another theme of the book, besides family devotion is the importance of working hard and studying hard. Maeve and Danny are hard workers and believe in education for its own sake. This is another reason why I love this book. At the heart of the book is their home, the one their father bought as a gift for their mother, that she rejected. The children survive despite the loss of their home and even their wicked stepmother is toothless at the end."

For me, having had a bad childhood and a bad marriage, “Home” has always been a place. Now that I’m divorced, the first home that I created for myself after my divorce was the first place that I ever truly felt safe in my entire life. Now, having moved, I have strived to create that same feeling of “Home” elsewhere. For others, “Home” may be the people you surround yourselves with.In “The Dutch House” by Ann Patchett, “the house” as such, plays a huge part of the story and everything revolves around it. For some of the characters in this novel, I believe that home is definitely a place.Danny and Maeve Conroy are siblings who live in The Dutch House with their parents until tragedy strikes and then the unthinkable happens and Danny and Maeve’s life changes drastically. Thereafter Danny and Maeve visit The Dutch House frequently albeit from the confines of Maeve’s car. Reflecting and reminiscing. Though their lives go on and decades pass, Danny and Maeve’s lives always revolve around The Dutch House, what has transpired over the years and what goes on inside on a daily basis. Thought provoking, engaging and heartbreaking, “The Dutch House” includes a whole host of complex characters and emotions. There are several themes in this book, including: acceptance; dysfunction; family; friendship; forgiveness; love; obsession; reconciliation and perseverance, to name a few. This book will evoke emotion, whether you like it or not. Frustration, anger, disgust, joy and/or love. I was wholly engrossed in the storyline and in the characters and every time a “shoe dropped” my jaw just about dropped as well. I grabbed the audiobook of this from my library and was delighted to find that TOM HANKS was the narrator! TOM freaking HANKS!!! He did a phenomenal job narrating and completely drew me into this story. What I can say is that I truly enjoyed this story and loved the characters of Danny and Maeve. I found certain aspects of the story to be a bit unbelievable given my personal background but I enjoyed the book nonetheless. While I preferred “Commonwealth,”I did enjoy this and would recommend it to fans of literary fiction. A huge thank you to my local library for loaning me a copy of this audiobook! Thank you to Tom Hanks for the stellar narration!Published on Goodreads on 10.18.20."

30,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36348070-brandice,Rating 4 out of 5,"Ann Patchett rarely disappoints and The Dutch House is no exception. This story spans several decades, beginning with siblings Danny and Maeve, in their childhood, growing up in the Dutch House, outside of Philadelphia. The story is told entirely from Danny’s perspective. He’s very close with Maeve, his older sister, as their mother, Elna, left when the children were young. The family was well-off and their father, Cyril, though not particularly warm, provided for and raised his two children, who couldn’t got a straight answer as to why Elna left, just hearing bits and pieces through others. I was frustrated on their behalf for the lack of answers. Cyril remarries Andrea, a woman with little regard for Danny and Maeve, even though she has two daughters of her own. When tragedy strikes, Andrea kicks Danny and Maeve out of the Dutch House, redirecting the course of their lives. The siblings grow even closer as they deal with the devastating blow of being thrown out of their home and try to forge on with their new life. Is a house really a home? Does karma exist? At what point, if ever, does forgive and forget happen? These are all questions indirectly posed in The Dutch House, where the house itself is a central character in the story. I liked both Danny and Maeve though at points, I recognized why their fierce loyalty to one another could be frustrating for others. Danny bent a bit too easily to Maeve’s wishes at times. I did enjoy the subtle sarcasm of Danny’s adult POV in the story. It never ceases to amaze me how talented of a writer Ann Patchett is - I’m a big fan and continue to marvel at how she writes such great stories, none of which are alike. I appreciate the variation of settings, different characters, and that her stories do not follow a set formula. While I didn’t love The Dutch House quite as much as Commonwealth or State of Wonder, I still really liked it and found the book to be a worthy read."

32,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28819314-eric-anderson,Rating 5 out of 5,"There are some novels where I instantly feel connected to the narrator as if he were an old friend. Something about the way Ann Patchett presents her central character of Danny Conroy in her new novel “The Dutch House” hooked me to his consciousness. Maybe it's the tone of his wide-eyed innocence and ignorance as he looks back at his childhood, family life and the home he was cast out of. It's a sensibility I can relate to now that I'm in my early 40s and think back to the mysteries of my early life wondering why certain decisions were made. Danny and his sister Maeve grow up in a grand house with a prosperous father, but their mother abandoned them in their childhood. When their father marries a new woman named Andrea who brings her own two daughters into the house, the Conroy children feel themselves growing even more estranged from their aloof father. In their teenage years they are unceremoniously ousted from their family home and must fend for themselves. Danny recounts this story and the haunting way he and his sister often linger outside the house they've been cast out of ruminating about the past and the truth about their family. In a way, every adult must feel this way reflecting on what Joyce Carol Oates calls “the lost landscape” of childhood. Patchett also poses a number of tantalizing mysteries about this particular family which kept me gripped and I admire the subtle way she raises lingering questions to do with the meaning of family, belonging and home.

I've read a number of her books, saw her speak a few times, even went to her bookstore while on a work trip through Nashville. Needless to say, there was no doubt I would read this one and like it. I've yet to read anything that she writes and not like it. I still have a few of her books to read (that I have copies of, even signed copies of books) but feel like I don't want to rush. I always want to have one of her books available to read. I know it's odd. But on to The Dutch House.The Dutch House is a slow moving family story, a sad family story. The story goes back and forth in time, over five decades, telling us about the lives of Danny and Maeve Conroy. Danny and Maeve grew up, to a point, in The Dutch House. As with any Ann Patchett story, I wanted it to end a different way. Perhaps that's just me. You hear from the time when Danny and Maeve are small children, until very much later in life, and that house. The Dutch House plays such a strong role in the story, but also in the lives of anyone who has been in that house. It has this pull, this allure, that Danny and Maeve are almost, many times, living the in past and remembering their time in that house. Even though the story is one of such a fractured family, the bond between Danny and Maeve are so strong. It kept me pushing to finish to hear more.As soon as it was available, I begged my library for the audio version. I was the first to get it! Yeah! Tom Hanks narrated the story. At first, I thought I might not like the narration. I love Tom Hanks (who doesn't) but was afraid it would just not work. I thought he did a good job, sometimes I thought maybe a bit much. But I was so drawn into the story. I often listen while working in the kitchen and was looking for things to do, just so I could hear more. The story was quite slow at times but I liked it (hence 4 stars). I can't say this is my favorite of hers. Bel Canto will forever be my favorite. One I should probably re-read, or perhaps one of her's I'm savoring on my shelves will be next in line."

I loved all the characters (including the house) and how Ann Patchett portrayed them in all their humanity. Even though the story, told by Danny, the Conroy son and brother to Maeve, goes back and forth in time over five decades, I found it quite easy to follow.

With The Dutch House it took me nearly two weeks to work up the ‘courage’ to review it. The fact is that I loved The Dutch House so much that I find hard to see it as a ‘mere’ work of fiction.This is the eighth novel that I’ve read by Ann Patchett and she has yet to disappoint. It is difficult to ‘pick’ a favourite, even if I can see that throughout the course of her writing career she has really honed her craft. Yet, I wholeheartedly loved her early books (especially her unjustly underrated 1997 novel, The Magician's Assistant), so to imply that she ‘keeps getting better’ would be doing her a disservice. Regardless of the scope of her stories (whether they take place in a short period of time in a particular city, such as in Run, or move us between two ‘extremes’, in The Magician's Assistant we move between Los Angeles and Nebraska, or take us on even longer journey, for instance in State of Wonder we follow Dr. Marina Singh’s as she leaves Minnesota for the Amazon Rainforest) Patchett tends to explore the same themes: there is a focus on familial relationships, especially between siblings, and these established dynamics are often changed due to some ‘major’ event (often the death of a loved one/relative/colleague). Although The Dutch House is written in Patchett’s signature prose, which can be described as being deceptively simple it features a first-person perspective, which is a departure from her usual third-person point of view. Being inside Danny Conroy’s head makes for an immersive experience and within the first pages I was captivated by his story. Through an act of retrospection Danny looks back to the past and what follows is a narrative that could be described as a bildungsroman. Danny’s childhood in the Dutch House—a large, if not incongruous, mansion in a prosperous suburb of Philadelphia—is clouded by the absence of his mother (a woman he cannot clearly recall but whose absence he nonetheless feels) and by his relationship with his remote father. It is Maeve, Danny’s older sister, who takes on the role of ‘parental’ figure, and their relationship is very much the underlying thread of the story. The Dutch House, weighed down by its history, inspires fascination in Andrea, the woman who will go on to become Danny and Maeve’s step-mother. The novel begins in fact with Danny’s memory of his first meeting with Andrea, one that seems to have almost a fairy-tale-esque quality in that it was the day where ‘everything’ seemed to change.Throughout Danny’s narrative we will also see the way in which the Conroy siblings remain drawn to the house, a house which seems to acquire an emblematic role in the lives of those who have lived in: it represents their childhoods, their father—his career, his marriage(s)—and the rather unfortunate VanHoebeeks. Patchett renders this house without loosing herself in extensive architectural descriptions, rather she brings to the foreground some of its features (Maeve's windowseat) and some of its objects. The paintings within the house (Maeve's portrait and those of the VanHoebeeks) also seem to hold a certain function in Danny's recollection of his past.“Maybe it was neoclassical, though with a simplicity in the lines that came closer to Mediterranean or French, and while it was not Dutch, the blue delft mantels in the drawing room, library, and master bedroom were said to have been pried out of a castle in Utrecht and sold to the VanHoebeeks to pay a prince’s gambling debts. The house, complete with mantels, had been finished in 1922.”In his remembrance Danny frequently makes vague, if not downright oblique, allusions to later events or revelations, which in turn creates tension between his past and present. Also framing Danny's recollection of his youth are a series of scenes in which he sits in alongside Maeve in her car just outside the Dutch House.Danny also questions the veracity of his memories: “But we overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.” He reassess certain moments and figures of his past, finding hidden complexities in what had at first appeared to be seemingly unremarkable occurrences.“Do you think it’s possible to ever see the past as it actually was?”While the novel is narrated by Danny he never paints himself as the ‘hero’ of his own story. He often wonders whether he should have acted in a different way towards someone or something, trying to understand why things unfurled the way that they did. While the motivations of other characters might escape him-and possibly us-they are never reduced to a certain role/function. The each have a story even if we are not always made privy to it. An although there is an awareness of the limitations provided by Danny's narration, the story never feels restricted to his experiences and worldview. “Whatever romantic notions I might have harbored, whatever excuses or allowances my heart had ever made on her behalf, blew out like a match.”My edition of The Dutch House includes an essay in which Ann Patchett says that “for a long time I had planned to call the book Maeve as it was her story.” The novel, in fact, very much pivots around Maeve but it is her brother who is telling her tale.We see the way in which their experiences in the Dutch House makes them determined to fulfil their desires or to take a certain path in their life: for Danny that is to become, as his father before him, a real-estate developer, while Maeve wants to carry on working a job she loves even if many consider her to be overqualified to do. While to some degree Danny's vision of Maeve influences our perception of her, we are always aware that she may have hidden qualities. What is certainly undeniable is her love for her brother. Their bond is portrayed with such frankness and poignancy as to become vividly real in the reader’s mind.This a story full of beauty and sorrow. There are regrets, wonderful reflections on memory, moments that are brimming with love or sadness...Patchett spins a tale in which families fall apart or come together. It is an intimate depiction of the bond between two siblings. Time and again Danny draws strength from his relationship to his sister, and even when he begins to feel unmoored from his own life, and as he struggles trying to reconcile himself with his past, Maeve provides him with a sense of belonging.Patchett's sense of place is as detailed and evocative as ever. She seamlessly renders midcentury America through Danny's narration, evoking within me a sense of nostalgia for a country I've never even been to. And while Danny's story spans decades, it maintains its focus on the same group of people, painting an intimate portrait of Danny's friends and family....to put it simply I fell in love with it. Patchett's harmonious prose made the experience all the more beautiful, and I was so enthralled by her story and her characters that to I struggled to think of them as works of fiction.What more can I say? I think this is a masterpiece.“We had made a fetish out of our misfortune, fallen in love with it. I was sickened to realize we’d kept it going for so long, not that we had decided to stop.”Read more reviews on my blog / / / View all my reviews on Goodreads"
36,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56035852-katie,Rating 2 out of 5,"I'm relieved to get this over and done with. In England we're very familiar with novels about enchanted houses. Off the top of my head there's Brideshead Revisited, Howard's End, Wuthering Heights, Jane Eyre, To the Lighthouse, The Tenant of Wildfall Hall, I Capture the Castle. All of them much better than this American take on the theme. A brother and sister are left by their mother. She leaves to help the poor in India. An utterly unconvincing plot device which was never given credence. Their father remarries a nightmare woman. The evil stepmother was by a country mile the best character in the book but unfortunately she doesn't occupy much of it. Mostly we see the brother and sister as adults, both of whom are dysfunctional where relationships are concerned, something they share with every other character in the novel. They share an incestuous relationship in all but deed. Neither has a glamorous or creative job. And the problem for me was they simply weren't interesting. We learn little about them of interest. Why didn't Maeve, the daughter, ever have a love relationship? There's lots and lots of mundane domestic detail in this novel but little insight. There was at least one whole chapter that could have been taken out without losing any relevant information. There's also no humour. Patchett's prose is neat and tidy but without risk or adventure. The resolution was hackneyed. Objectively, it isn't a bad book (I don't think it's a particularly good one either) but when characters you're supposed to sympathise with bore and irritate you there's no getting past it."

I only understood what I'd lost."" With The Dutch House, Ann Patchett has created a story that jumps off the page. Fully realized characters and one of the BEST sibling relationships I've ever read about in 337 short pages. And it didn't need to be any longer. It was absolutely perfect.This is the story of a house and its inhabitants. It's really Danny's story most, which I loved. When I read Patchett's previous novel  Commonwealth, which I really enjoyed, I wished it had a bit more focus. It spreads itself across many more perspectives, and while the writing is strong—just as it is here—the pacing waxes and wanes as the stories unfold. In this novel, however, we only ever hear from Danny. He's an endearing, empathetic, but not always to be trusted narrator. But his qualms are understandable as he's been through childhood trauma that reverberates through decades as we follow him and his sister Maeve grow up and away from their childhood home.In ways this reminded me of  The Goldfinch—thematically, stylistically, but also with this inimitable quality of feeling. This book was a book of feelings: rage and sympathy and small joys and sorrows that make up a complicated life.Patchett has her pulse on human emotion unlike many authors, and in this novel she's both prodded the wound and provided the salve. It's quite a feat and one I'll be contemplating for a long time."
39,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4271946-jessica-woodbury,Rating 5 out of 5,"I cannot explain why Ann Patchett is so good because while I read her books, I am so engrossed and involved that I do not have the capability to figure it out. That would mean letting go of the story, slowing down or stopping, not letting myself get pulled along deeper and deeper. Her prose and her plots are often (though not always) simple. I cannot tell why I am absolutely mesmerized, I just am. It is simply something to be accepted, and something to be treasured.THE DUTCH HOUSE left me with an emotional hangover I still haven't quite recovered from a day later. It worked its slow, sneaky magic on me until I was at its mercy. At first I did not quite see where it would take me, a few plot twists surprised me, but by the last third even when I knew exactly what was going to happen I felt helpless, watching, weeping, carried along by its tide. The themes of the novel are ones that hit me very deeply, which certainly added to my experience. The mystery of parents to their children, the way we see others' mistakes so clearly and then make the very same mistakes ourselves, the way the experience inside a single family can feel drastically different to everyone in it. And on top of all of that is a question of forgiveness, its blessings and its limits. Forgiveness is something I think about a lot, as I am very very bad at it, but this story is not entirely sold on it either and the sometimes-arbitrary way we deem some people worthy of forgiveness and others absolutely undeserving is one of those tricks of human nature the novel uses to full effect.Danny, our narrator, begins the novel as a child. His mother has left so long ago he barely remembers her. His father is distant. His sister Maeve, seven years older, is his parent and his closest confidant. Their father is in real estate, and they live in the titular house, an architectural marvel in the Philadelphia suburbs in the mid-20th century, filled with the belongings of the prior inhabitants, the kind of people who have giant portraits of themselves hanging on the wall. As the novel starts, their father brings home a woman, bringing a massive change to the small family. Maeve is the center of the story, and she remains throughout Danny's life the center of his world. As their family changes and then crumbles, Maeve is all that Danny has and she is devoted to his success. While Maeve loves Danny deeply, she also uses him as a tool to take out her revenge against their stepmother, something Danny is not all that interested in doing, but he doesn't put up much of a fight. Over the years they try to learn more about their closed-off father and their missing mother, needing to build up a family mythology and a deeper understanding of how it all went wrong. By the end of the novel, this small story has taken on an epic scale. I love it when a domestic plot can take on the kinds of choices and betrayals that lead to overwhelming emotions. Patchett does that so well in this book, slowly laying the groundwork, making the stakes clear, sketching the characters in minute detail, so when you reach the end you may find yourself unable to stop reading, sobbing on the couch. (Or maybe that's just me.) A rewarding, fulfilling novel.Update: Re-read in 2023 and... it definitely didn't hit the same for me for whatever reason. This time I was so annoyed at adult Danny, rolling my eyes at how he romanticized being a landlord, frustrated at how he is constantly cared for by everyone in his life and never appreciates it. I do like the fairy tale nature of it, and Patchett is so weirdly good at jumping around in time. "

It tells the story of a brother and sister over the course of five decades.At the end of the Second World War, Cyril Conroy combines luck and a single canny investment to begin an enormous real estate empire, propelling his family from poverty to enormous wealth. His first order of business is to buy the Dutch House, a lavish estate in the suburbs outside of Philadelphia. Meant as a surprise for his wife, the house sets in motion the undoing of everyone he loves.The story is told by Cyril’s son Danny, as he and his older sister, the brilliantly acerbic and self-assured Maeve, are exiled from the house where they grew up by their stepmother. The two wealthy siblings are thrown back into the poverty their parents had escaped from and find that all they have to count on is one another. It is this unshakable bond between them that both saves their lives and thwarts their futures.Set over the course of five decades, The Dutch House is a dark fairy tale about two smart people who cannot overcome their past. Despite every outward sign of success, Danny and Maeve are only truly comfortable when they’re together. Throughout their lives, they return to the well-worn story of what they’ve lost with humor and rage. But when at last they’re forced to confront the people who left them behind, the relationship between an indulged brother and his ever-protective sister is finally tested.عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: ‏‫«خانه‌ ی هلندی»؛ «عمارت هلندی»؛ نویسنده: آن پچت؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش روز بیست و سوم ماه سپتامبر سال2019میلادیعنوان: ‏‫خانه‌ ی هلندی؛ نویسنده: آن پچت‮‬‏‫؛ مترجم منا اختیاری؛ تهران، آموت، 1398؛ در 416ص؛ شاب9786003841628؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده 21معنوان: عمارت هلندی؛ نویسنده آن پچت؛ ‏‫مترجم یاسمن ثانوی؛ ویراستار کاوه عزیزی؛ تهران، روزگار، 1399؛ در 352ص؛ شابک9786222330958؛عنوان: عمارت هلندی؛ نویسنده: آن پچت؛ مترجم الهام جمالی‌پویا؛ تهران، کتاب مرو، 1400، در 377ص؛ شابک9786227384178؛عنوان: عمارت هلندی (کوتاه شده)؛ نویسنده آن پچت؛ مترجم نازنین صابری؛ تهران، آسمان نیلگون؛ 1400؛ در 76ص؛ شابک9786227633375؛داستان برادری و خواهری در پنج دهه است؛ «خانه ی هلندی یا عمارت هلندی» ساختمانی‌ در پارک «الکینز، پنسیلوانیا» در حومه ی «فیلادلفیا» است؛ خانواده ی «فن هوبیک»، زن و شوهری با اصالت «هلندی»، که دارایی خود را از صنعت دخانیات، به دست آورده بودند، آن خانه را در سال1922میلادی ساخته اند، ملّاکی خودساخته و پیروز، به نام «سیریل کانروی»، در سال 1946میلادی، آن ساختمان را خرید، تا همسرش «النا» را غافلگیر کند؛ فرزندان آنها، «دنی» و «مِیو» در «خانه ی هلندی» بزرگ شدند؛ «النا»، «خانه ی هلندی» را دوست ندارد، و آنگاه که «دنی» سه ساله و «مِیو» ده ساله است، خانواده‌ اش را رها می‌کند، تا به فقرای «هند» یاری رساند؛ پس از درگذشت «سیریل»، نامادری بچه‌ها «آندره»، «دنی» و «میو» را از خانه بیرون می‌کند، این خواهر و برادر که دیگر کسی را ندارند، باید به همدیگر تکیه نمایند؛ «میو» با باقیمانده ی ارثیه‌ شان، «دنی» را به مدرسه ی شبانه‌ روزی «چوت رزمری هال»، دانشگاه «کلمبیا» و دانشکده پزشکی می‌فرستد؛ «دنی»، با اینکه علاقه‌ ای به پزشکی ندارد، برای خوشآیند «میو» دانشکده پزشکی را به پایان می‌رساند؛ راوی این رمان «دنی کانروی» در بزرگسالی‌ خویشتن استتایخ بهنگام رسانی 01/07/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"
42,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2172096-barbara,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5 starsThe lives of siblings Danny and Maeve Conroy are overshadowed by their childhood home, 'The Dutch House', an elegant glass mansion located in Elkins Park - a ritzy suburb of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The house, which looks more like a museum than a residence, was built by the Dutch VanHoebeeks in the 1920s, and purchased - complete with furniture and home décor - by budding real estate mogul Cyril Conroy in 1946. Cyril is delighted to surprise his young family with the house, not knowing it will affect their lives in unpredictable ways. Danny Conroy, who narrates the book as an adult, describes the three-story house as ""a singular confluence of talent and luck that was too much house for anyone"".....but that felt just right to him and Maeve. From certain angles, ""the house seemed to float several inches above the hill it sat on"" and ""the panes of glass that surrounded the glass front door were as big as storefront windows and held in place by wrought iron vines."" The blue Delft mantelpieces in the drawing room, library, and master bedroom were “said to have been pried out of a castle in Utrecht and sold to the VanHoebeeks to pay a prince’s gambling debts.” The house also boasted silk chairs, tapestry ottomans, oil paintings, Chinese lamps, marble floors, gilt ceilings, egg and dart molding, a large ballroom, imposing portraits of Mr. and Mrs. VanHoebeek, a swimming pool, and much more. The first casualty of the Dutch house is Danny and Maeve's mother, Elna, a humble woman who feels compelled to do good works. Elna is profoundly oppressed by the opulent house, and runs off to India to help the poor when Danny is three and Maeve is ten.Since dad Cyril is more involved with his business than his children, Danny and Maeve are largely brought up by housekeeper/cooks Sandy and Jocelyn. The women are conscientious and affectionate caretakers, but they aren't mothers, and Maeve essentially steps into this role for her brother. For her part, Maeve is inconsolable at the loss of her mom, and in addition to general malaise develops diabetes - which the family attributes to Elna's desertion. In time Cyril meets a woman named Andrea, who's mesmerized by the Dutch house. Cyril isn't particularly interested in Andrea, but she slyly inveigles herself into his life, marries him, and moves in with her daughters Norma and Bright. The children - Danny, Maeve, Norma, and Bright - get along like a house afire, but Danny and Maeve never warm up to Andrea.....or she to them. Sadly, as soon as Andrea moves in, she makes it her business to disenfranchise Danny and Maeve.Right after Maeve leaves for Barnard College in New York, for instance, Andrea usurps Maeve's lovely bedroom for Norma and Bright. And when Cyril and Danny plan an excursion to New York to have lunch with Maeve and explore buildings, Andrea invites herself and her girls along AND changes the itinerary to accommodate her own interests. (This doesn't work out so well for Andrea though. 😊)Cyril dies at 53, when 22-year-old Maeve has graduated college and 15-year-old Danny is in high school. Andrea promptly throws Danny out, calling Maeve to come and get him. The angry, hurt siblings set up housekeeping in Maeve's apartment in a nearby town, where Maeve works as an accountant/manager for a frozen vegetable company. Danny and Maeve retrieve very little from the Dutch house, not even family heirlooms or Maeve's portrait, which was commissioned by her father. As it turns out, Danny and Maeve are left with almost nothing. It seems Andrea managed to get EVERYTHING in her name: the Dutch house; Cyril's business; and Cyril's money. (One wonders what Cyril - and his lawyer - were thinking. 😒)Cyril never made a will, and the only thing left specifically for the children (Danny, Maeve, Norma, and Bright) is a trust fund for their education. Danny had planned to join (and eventually inherit) his dad's real estate business, which Andrea promptly sells. So - out of spite - Maeve insists that Danny attend Choate boarding school, then Columbia University, then Columbia Medical School.....all of which are very expensive schools. (FYI: Combined tuition and expenses would cost more than a million dollars in today's money). Andrea is infuriated by Danny draining the education fund, but is helpless to intervene. ChoateColumbiaThough Danny and Maeve no longer have any ownership in the Dutch house, they're inexorably drawn back. The siblings periodically park in front of the house, lambaste Andrea, and reminisce about their lives there.They talk about their mother, their step-sisters Norma and Bright, the housekeepers Sandy and Jocelyn, their bamboozled father, Danny's future, etc. Maeve wants Danny to be a doctor but - though he's training in the medical field - Danny continues to dream of going into real estate. Even in later years, when Danny and Maeve are adults with numerous responsibilities, they occasionally 'visit' the Dutch house.We follow Danny and Maeve for several decades, during which a lot happens: marriage, children, career advancement, new homes, squabbles, chance meetings, re-acquaintances, illness, death.....the usual drama of life. Through it all, Danny and Maeve remain the most important people in each other's lives. No matter what he's doing, Danny always longs to step away and call Maeve; and the only person Maeve loves more than Danny is her departed mother. The story is by no means a tragedy, and no one is out on the street dressed in rags and starving. In fact, from an outside point of view, Danny and Maeve lead very successful lives. The siblings' own dearest wish would probably be to toss Andrea out on her ear....but, as the Rolling Stones sing, ""No, you can't always get what you want; you can't always get what you want; but if you try sometime you find, you get what you need."" The Rolling StonesBy the end of the book, things in Elkins Park come full circle....but in an unexpected way.The book is rather slow-moving for my taste, but I was invested in the story and found the characters memorable, so - for me - the novel was worth reading.

At times, the description of the Dutch House and it’s importance for the characters throughout their lives reminded me of the large old house we grew up in. Our house was known by the name of one of the early owners who became famous, and everyone in our small town referred to it as such. It was a beautiful old home with a ton of character, and one that needed even more work when our family moved in. But, it was the spot for many of our best memories of our childhood, and it’s the only house that I occasionally return to as time goes by. Definitely recommend the audiobook, Tom Hanks was fantastic. Enjoy!"

'The Dutch House' refers to a mansion Meave and Danny live with their parents. We go through the lives of these siblings from their childhood to quite late in their lives. Their mother leaves suddenly without a word one day when they were children, and they never knew why. We go through the next phase of their lives after this event till they are old basically. If you haven't read Ann Patchett before, you need to know that her books are very much character driven, not plot driven. We go through the life span of a family and witness their lives. In this book, the focus was the 2 siblings and their tight relationship. Meave and Danny were a delight to follow. I even envied their unshaken closeness and love for each other as an only child :) They go through a lot together and their support for each other helps them achieve in life. Of course there are lots of other characters, but they are revolving around this brother & sister. I love Patchett's writing. It's very slow, but very immersive. Before you know it, you're drawn to these characters and want to know what's going on in their simple lives. I . was thinking of the book when I wasn't reading it, and wanted to return to it for sure. For people who love slow, character driven stories that goes on for a lifetime, Ann Patchett is the address :) The Waterstones edition with its sprayed edges is a delight!

With each book I fall ever more in love with the elegance of her writing, it’s the kind I melt into, that carries me along the plot line, which seems simple on the surface, meeting characters along the way that I soon come to regard as family with the range of emotions that implies. And even when I don’t particularly like the ending, I accept that it is as it should be.This is a timeless plot with unforgettable characters, but it is the house that looms large in both its physical presence and in the characters’ emotional and often obsessive attachment to it. Ann offers a perfectly paced and intimate portrait of family, loss and longing and will leave you to ponder the essential question posed, do you think it is ever possible to see the past as it actually was?Love doesn’t begin to cover my feelings about this book.

In my world things go wrong, people make mistakes, people struggle to be accepted, to be understood, to be loved, to pay the bills. Bloddy hell, in my world people even struggle to get out of bed each morning. The thing is, I come from a very big family and life has been hard for most of the time for all of us. Isolation, uneducated and exploited children, too many pregnancies, teenage pregnancies, disabilities, bullying, hunger, financial problems, cancer, depression, drug abuse, Alzheimer’s, suicide (and more). There was always a “story” about one of these topics in my life (sometimes more than one at the same time. Can you believe it?). We, as a family, have seen all of this. We know of these things not simply because we’ve heard about them but because we’ve been there. We know how it feels. Oh, yes, life is hard. Sometimes unbearably hard. And this is why I didn’t believe any of this. Well, to be clear and fair, I didn’t believe in a single world Ann Patchett has written down here. I believe Mrs Patchett simply didn’t know. She heard it all in the news. It’s not her fault that she has been lucky. Luck plays a big role in this game called life, you know…Mrs Patchett might have done some research on real estate and law but for me that didn’t make for a more believable storyline anyway. She’d put her characters in a certain difficult situation and then, because she didn’t really know how things happen in the real world, she jumps forwards in time and (abracadabra) everything’s sorted. Then she jumps in time again, this time backwards and tells us about another difficult situation in the characters lives but only to jump forward again in time and (abracadabra) we’ll find everything is sorted again. When she wasn’t solving things jumping in time, she would add an unbelievable coincidence or create a convenient new character and easily sort things out (again). Clever, hum?! While reading this book, I actually never knew how things played out, I just learned that they did. When Mrs Patchett finally stopped using this annoying literary device its was already too late and I didn’t really give a damn about what happened or not to all these people. Later on, Mrs Patchett went back to her favourite way of sorting things out and she managed to annoy me even more by telling me “two weeks later” that she killed one of the main characters. Ahahah. If all this had happened to real human beings they would have pulled out all the hair from their own heads. They would have screamed and shouted. They would have cried for mercy. It’s human nature. And this takes us to what was missing here and what I wanted to see, what I think was needed to tell a story like this; Humanity. Three stars only because this was a quick and easy read and the writing wasn’t that bad. This was my introduction to Ann Patchett’s writing and I’ve had enough of her already. She definitely adds too much sugar for my taste. No more for me, thank you very much."

Paintings of the Dutch couple, Mr. and Mrs. VanHoebeek (“Van-who-bake”), dominate the drawing room and a portrait of Maeve, at ten in her bright red coat, hangs on the opposite wall. That’s the cover of the book, which is great.The story is told in a circular fashion. It opens with their father bringing home a woman, Andrea, to meet his children. Their mother had left, returned, left, returned, and finally left for good. The two servants, Sandy and Jocelyn, have been raising the children, who are comfortable with things the way they are. Maeve is fifteen, Danny, eight. Andrea is obviously smitten with the grand house but seems less enthusiastic about Cyril’s children. Maeve is already a head taller than the tiny widow, and later, when they discover Andrea has two little girls, there is even less likelihood she will view them favourably.”Though the story will be remembered that Maeve and Andrea were at odds right from the start, that wasn’t true. Maeve was perfectly fair and polite when they met, and she remained fair and polite until doing so was no longer possible.”Cyril has become a successful property developer and Danny loves going with him to inspect buildings and building sites and collect the rents from tenants. He looks forward to taking over the company one day. He’s learning how to fix taps, patch cracks, work with his hands.“’The only way to really understand what money means is to have been poor,’ he said to me when we were eating lunch in the car. ‘That’s the strike you have against you. A boy grows up rich like you, never wanting for anything, never being hungry’—he shook his head, as if it had been a disappointing choice I’d made—'I don’t know how a person overcomes a thing like that.’”He loves his dad, but it’s Maeve who is the gravitational force around which he orbits. They are fiercely loyal to each other, an unbreakable unit against the world. Maeve manages his life.I found Danny completely self-absorbed, worrying mostly about himself and Maeve, but taking little real interest in anyone else. He loves playing basketball with friends, but they aren’t part of the story. It’s interesting to read about children growing up in post-war Pennsylvania and how a war veteran like their father managed to establish himself. It is not interesting to have scene after scene after scene of Maeve and Danny talking about the house and picking at the scabs on the wounds caused by Andrea, and before that, their mother’s disappearance. It’s all about Danny, and I wasn’t that crazy about him. I understand the popular audio book is narrated by Tom Hanks. The voice in my head was a bit petulant sometimes, more like Steve Carell's character from the American version of The Office, when Maeve was talking Danny into something. [I must admit, I haven't heard the Hanks rendition, and he's such a good actor, I know he can complain as well as anyone. But he's better known for being likeable and smart.]I lost interest as time went on. I found the strength of Maeve’s influence a bit much to swallow. I don’t want to give any spoilers, so I’ll just say that the alliances that formed later and the resolution of some of the relationships seemed to tie up the loose ends too neatly and unrealistically, for me. But don’t take my word for it. This is a very popular book, and you may love it as so many others have. I enjoyed it enough to round up to four stars rather than down to three.Thanks to NetGalley and Bloomsbury for the preview copy from which I’ve quoted."
51,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25472453-christy,Rating 3 out of 5,"Tom Hanks as narrator... YES PLEASE!! I will listen to anything he reads -- I just love him so much! I feel like the main character in this book is literally the house -- The Dutch House. Cyril Conroy builds an extremely successful real estate business, literally a rags to riches story. His children are Maeve and Danny. Danny is the narrator of the family story. Cyril buys the house as a gift for his wife, Elna, who ends up hating everything it stands for. She later abandons her family when the children are still very young. She can't stand the house, living in it, or being waited on while there are poor people all over the world that need help. When their father later dies, the children are kicked out of the house by their horrible step mother, Andrea. They are forced to rely on one another, and I loved hearing about how deep their sibling bond was for life. The house is literally the downfall for every character in the story at some point, and neither sibling can let it go and move on. They are always coming back to it, even if it is just to set outside of it and reminisce. Unpopular opinion: I didn't love this one like I expected. I typically love family stories that span many decades, but this one fell flat for me. However, it was definitely beautifully written and started off strong. I was super into the beginning, and then I felt myself just wanting it to be over. Much of it seemed so unrealistic and I just got very bored."

I wouldn't have appreciated this tale if I read it on paper since very little happens. I didn’t dislike it but I also couldn’t give t 4 stars as there’s nothing in particular that stayed with me. Do I get why this book is so popular? No. But it was an interesting read nonetheless. I can see why it’s popular among book clubs, lots of things to discuss. "
53,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25667717-doug,Rating 5 out of 5,"A HUGE thanx to Netgalley and HarperCollins for a review copy of this book, in exchange for this honest review. I've only read two other Patchett books, but she has already become a favorite author, and I was very excited to be granted this ARC months prior to its publication in late Sept., since her last novel, Commonwealth, made it into my top 5 reads for 2016 - and I am fairly confident this one will do likewise for 2019.The storyline follows somewhat similar ground as that previous book, being, more or less, an intricate family saga covering decades of the ins and outs of the Conroy family, and in particular, how the titular family manse outside Philadelphia impacts and impedes various relationships. The focus is primarily on a pair of siblings, with younger brother Danny doing the narrating, and once again Patchett does not follow a linear chronology, but weaves the stories back and forwards from the late 40's to the early 2000's. I sometimes had trouble following this in her previous book, since there was a plethora of characters to keep straight, but this is an easier go, since there are really only about a dozen characters in total. Although Patchett's prose is not fussy or overtly calls attention to itself, it always flows beautifully and is a pleasure to luxuriate in. Just the kind of lovely, leisurely read one wants/needs for the beginning of summer. I hope it is a tremendous success for her."

This is an intelligent novel that is almost a fable including an evil stepmonster but it’s the house that looms large. A house that represents success, greed, loss, sadness and, ultimately, forgiveness. A wife is desperately unhappy, close siblings are eventually ousted and many lives are deeply affected by the house and what it means to each character. Patchett has a deft touch and now I’ll have the pleasure of reading her other work."
55,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59050228-meike,Rating 4 out of 5,"Now Nominated for the Women's Prize for Fiction 2020This family saga is compulsively readable and highly accessible, but not without depth: While the story is narrated from the point of view of Danny Conroy, the main protagonist is his sister Maeve who, after their father dies and their stepmother throws them out of the house, raises and takes care of her little brother. The title-giving Dutch House is the Conroy's former family home and becomes an obsession for the siblings who associate it with their lost childhood, a manifestation of their enigmatic past. Throughout their lives, the mansion exerts a gravitational pull, both as an idea and as a physical place: Danny and Maeve visit the house, but do not enter it, as their stepmother continues to live there. Patchett follows the Conroy siblings over decades, and the story is pushed forward by the riddles of their family history: What happened to their biological mother after she left the family? What happened to the nanny and the rest of the staff working for the family, what became of their stepsisters? What will become of Danny and Maeve who are now by themselves? Two narrative devices are particularly striking: The author remixes classic fairy tales (the siblings searching for their way home (Danny's wife even mentions ""Hänsel und Gretel""), the evil stepmother etc.) and works with the motif of the double. Characters often form pairs, most obviously the Conroy siblings themselves, and when a third party enters the picture, it gets complicated. Loyalty and selflessness are main topics of the book. The book is most interesting when Patchett hints at the subjective feelings of guilt and anger and at the flaws of the characters: Danny is a victim of the circumstanes, but frequently oblivious to the plight of those who try to help him; Maeve is struggling to find a balance between living her own life and protecting her brother; and many other characters are also torn between conflicting feelings and interests (I don't want to spoil the plot points that keep readers invested in the story). While the language is not particularly inventive or lyrical, it is still addictive and manages to create an absorbing atmosphere. Also, there are some aspects of the story that don't quite ring true and/or have an soap opera-like quality, but the story is so intriguing that it doesn't matter all that much. Patchett plants many ideas and develops them throughout the story (the meaning of a house as a home, illness and trauma, portraits as a means to reveal and capture people, the role of religion/Catholicism, the toxicity of unresolved conflicts, forms of love and selflessness), but the text is very easy to follow and reads quickly. So all in all, maybe not the biggest literary masterpiece ever written, but this book is very intelligent entertainment and fun to read.

57,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,Rating 5 out of 5,"An Ann Patchett novel is a treasure. She writes about family so compellingly that I always feel as if I know her characters in real life, and I'm drawn into the stories she shares about their inner lives.If you're already a Patchett fan, you've probably heard about how she describes her novels: ""I've been writing the same book my whole life -- that you're in one family, and all of a sudden, you're in another family and it's not your choice and you can't get out.""The Dutch House is a novel about family, but this time the focus is on two siblings, Maeve and Danny. Maeve is our heroine, but her younger brother Danny is our narrator. We see how their lives get upended when their mother runs away and their father picks a wicked stepmother as his second wife.I listened to this book on audio, performed by Tom Hanks, who was a marvelous storyteller. I usually read an Ann Patchett novel several times, and I'm already looking forward to re-reading this one and discovering anew all of her clever descriptions. Highly recommended for readers who like literary fiction.Favorite PassageFor the most part, what I knew about my father was what I saw: he was tall and thin with weathered skin and hair the color of rust, the color of my hair. All three of us had blue eyes. His left knee was slow to bend, worse in the winter and when it rained. He never said a word about it but it was easy enough to tell when it hurt him. He smoked Pall Malls, put milk in his coffee, worked the crossword puzzle before reading the front page. He loved buildings the way boys loved dogs. When I was eight years old, I asked my father at the dinner table if he was going to vote for Eisenhower or Stevenson. Eisenhower was running for a second term and all the boys in school were for him. My father clicked the point of his knife against his plate and told me I was never to ask a question like that, not of him, not of anyone. ""It may be fine for boys to speculate on whom they might vote for because boys can't vote,"" he said. ""But to ask an adult such a question is to violate a man's right to privacy."" In retrospect, I imagine my father was horrified that I might think there was any chance he'd vote for Stevenson, but I didn't know that at the time. What I knew was that you had to touch a hot stove only once. Here are the things I talked to my father about when I was a boy: baseball -- he liked the Phillies. Trees -- he knew the name of every one, though he would chastise me for asking about the same kind of tree more than once. Birds -- likewise. He kept feeders in the backyard and could easily identify all of his customers. Buildings -- be it their structural soundness, architectural details, property value, property tax, you name it -- my father liked to talk about buildings. To list the things I didn't ask my father about would be to list the stars in heaven, so let me throw out one: I did not ask my father about women. Not women in general and what you were supposed to do with them, and definitely not women in the particular: my mother, my sister, Andrea."

Do you ever get tired of reminiscing?”For those who’ve read Ann Patchett before, The Dutch House probably needs no introduction. It’s Ann Patchett. It’s a family saga. That’s all you need.For those (like me) who haven’t, it’s a little harder to explain the book’s appeal. It spans decades, following a brother and sister, Danny & Maeve Conroy. They live in a fancy house, then they don’t. The house is THE most remarkable thing about them. It haunts their lives.But it’s the way Patchett tells it that makes it special, the layers, the tapestry of details. We learn about the VanHoebeeks, who owned the Dutch House before the Conroys. When the VanHoebeek family line ended, the house was sold with all its contents, right down to the jewels, and two eerie life-sized paintings of the former occupants. It’s the depth of characterisations, where no one is wholly good or bad, the humanity contained in their flaws and foibles. It’s the fairytale allusions, the way Patchett replaces gingerbread and candy with floor-to-ceiling glass and blue delft mantels, and loses none of the magic and awe.This is a sparkling world of privilege, even after the house is lost, but Patchett avoids writing a ‘rich people problems’ book in two ways:1)	The problems faced are universal. A sudden death or betrayal or abandonment; an unexpected reversal of fortunes; long-simmering resentments and paths to forgiveness. Nothing money could solve. 2)	Chance is a major factor, as much in raising fortunes as losing them. Or call it luck, or fate, these lives are sailing on its winds.It’s an utterly charming, moving, absorbing novel, only slightly let down by some draggy bits and the fact that I deeply, deeply disliked the ending. But I’m definitely a Patchett fan now. 4 stars."

I KNOW I’m getting a solid novel that will cut into me, make me think, build compassion, see understanding. In her new novel “The Dutch House” she explores, again, children who are left without parental interest and supervision. As with “Commonwealth”, she also explores blended families and the bonds of stepsiblings. Beyond her themes, her writing is beautiful, lyrical, easy, like floating on an inter-tube on a lazy sunny day.Can you come to peace with what happened to you in childhood is a major theme? Danny is three when his mother leaves him and his sister Maeve, who is ten at the time. They live in a house that they call “The Dutch House” which is this big striking mansion that is ornate and ostentatious. Danny’s father bought it as a gift for Danny’s mother without her knowing. His parents were poor Irish immigrants and unbeknownst to his mother, his father, Cyril makes money in real estate without ever consulting or explaining their change in status to Elna, Danny’s mother. The family moves into the Dutch House when Maeve is five. The house even comes with a housekeeper, it’s too much for Elna who loves being poor.To add complexity, Cyril is an absent father and the children are basically raised by house staff. Along come an evil woman who has designs on the house and Cyril. Of course, Cyril marries her, and she brings in two girls. As with Patchett’s other stories, the children blend well. It’s the evil stepmother who adds tragedy when Cyril unexpectedly dies, and she bans Maeve and Danny from the house. Not only that, but she leaves the two penniless except for an educational trust left for Danny. By then Maeve is through college and Danny is a high schooler.Danny feels anger at his mother for abandoning them. Maeve feels longing. Their grit and determination get them through life. The story is told through Danny’s eyes and the story is non-linear, much like our thoughts.This would be a fabulous book club read. All the characters in the novel are fodder for discussion. Patchett shows how humans find their way, find their strengths and bonds. She shows through her characters how some can find forgiveness, some compassion, and always gratitude. "
