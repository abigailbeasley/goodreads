The ball won’t drop in Times Square for another two full months, and more good books will surely appear before the year ends. But I already know: My favorite novel of 2022 is Barbara Kingsolver’s “Demon Copperhead.”Equal parts hilarious and heartbreaking, this is the story of an irrepressible boy nobody wants, but readers will love. Damon is the only child of a teenage alcoholic — “an expert at rehab” — in southwest Virginia. He becomes aware of his status early, around the same time he gets the nickname Demon. “I was a lowlife,” he says, “born in the mobile home, so that’s like the Eagle Scout of trailer trash.” The more he grasps the connotations of words like “hick” and “redneck,” the more discouraged he becomes. “This is what I would say if I could, to all the smart people of the world with their dumb hillbilly jokes. …We can actually hear you.”Now, we can hear him.“You get to a point of not giving a damn over people thinking you’re worthless,” he says. “Mainly by getting there first yourself.”Demon is right about America’s condescending derision, but he’s wrong about his own worth. In a feat of literary alchemy, Kingsolver uses the fire of that boy’s spirit to illuminate — and singe — the darkest recesses of our country.The essential Americanness of “Demon Copperhead” feels particularly ironic given that Kingsolver has drawn her inspiration directly from one of England’s most celebrated classics: “David Copperfield,” by Charles Dickens. In a brief afterword, Kingsolver expresses her gratitude to Dickens and acknowledges....To read the rest of this review, go to The Washington Post:https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/..."
1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13427823-maureen,Rating 5 out of 5,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Demon Copperhead entered the world in a single trailer, born to a single mother who hadn’t a clue how to look after him - nor did she have the means. The southern Appalachian mountains of Virginia is where he took his first breath - a place of dire poverty, though most local folk were in the same boat, so it was pretty normal. Demon’s mum though had additional problems, and that meant even less of the basic needs for the two of them. Thank God for good neighbours.I won’t go into the synopsis as this is a lengthy (over 600 pages) and eventful novel. However, this is a tale of love and the need for love, it’s about dreams and anger, hate and pain, and what really stands out is how the opioid crisis is responsible for many of those bad feelings, and demonstrates how it wrecks the lives that might otherwise have climbed out of that daily grinding poverty, perhaps realising those long held dreams and ambitions.The journey for Demon Copperhead is long and eventful, (epic is the best way to describe it). The writing is so beautiful - exquisite even, but it takes the reader to places so dark, depressing and dangerous with its intimate detail, that you wonder why you find such beauty in it. But it’s there on every page, in every event and every crisis - harrowing yet uplifting. Has to be one of the standout books of the year - it is stunning!*Thank you to Netgalley and Faber and Faber Ltd for my much appreciated ARC. I have given an honest unbiased review in exchange *"
2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4685500-angela-m,Rating 5 out of 5,"This novel is described as a modern day version of David Copperfield, which I’ve never read. I’m generally not a fan of rewrites of classics, so if I had read it, I may not have picked this one up even though Barbara Kingsolver is such an amazing writer whose books I have loved over the years. I’m grateful to have read this novel because I would have missed out on a brilliant story - brutal, but brilliant and a character who was in my heart from the first to the last page . An addicted teenage mother, an abusive stepfather, a corrupt foster care system reeking of abuse is what Demon Copperhead endures at the young age of ten years old. Working on a tobacco farm, then with a family who has him sleeping in a dog room, hungry, taking leftovers from school lunch trays, he endures - somehow without speaking up to his case worker for fear of what his next foster situation would be. His next one turns out to be life altering in more ways than one. This is an in your face, in your gut punch, no holds barred portrayal all of that, and a stabbing expose of the opioid epidemic in Appalachia. It’s depressing and heartbreaking to read with little respite. I was drained at times . As with other books by Kingsolver, there is a social message here, but it’s not just told with statistics of addictions, deaths, but through the moving story of a character as a little boy and then as a young man, with all of the horrors he faced in between, feeling as real as it gets . I received a copy of this book from HarperCollins through Edelweiss."

I’m not here to yuck your yum so Imma keep it real short. In a nutshell, Kingsolver is an author who is consistently trying to write the “Great American Novel” and nothing demonstrates that more than her undertaking a modernization of David Copperfield. In short, I just don’t think she’s my jam. Nearly 25 years ago The Poisonwood Bible knocked my socks off, but it’s a book I could never re-read in fear that I wouldn’t have the same reaction a second time around. My main issue with this one is that I am so over clichéd, stereotypes of Appalachia. Boy oh boy did Demon Copperhead deliver them in spades. Our impoverished lead goes from bad to worse when it comes to an abusive household, to being orphaned, to one awful foster home situation to another (but don't worry - it ends at neglect - Kingsolver isn't ready to go to the darkest of locales when it comes to Demon's childhood). Eventually genetics get on young Demon’s side and he becomes a local high school football hero . . . until, you guessed it, his knee gets blown out and he becomes an addict. But don’t worry – he still gets a fairly happy ending and sees the ocean *eyeroll*In addition to the been there/done that feel of this entire story, you can’t re-write history in an attempt to prove how “woke” you are. A high school English teacher (and a black teacher in the middle of the Holler, at that) in the early to mid-1990s wouldn't have dared to explain the movement of literature changing the term “black” to “Black.” Not to mention how regular folks were not aware of the dangers of opioids or how Big Pharma was controlling the narrative when they first hit the market, but the nurse in here was 100% in the know of what's going down. You want to learn more about the modern-day drug crises and how it came to be? Read Dopesick."
4,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59050228-meike,Rating 3 out of 5,"Now Winner of the Women's Prize for Fiction 2023 *aaargh*Joint Winner of the Pulitzer Prize 2023 with the equally simplistic TrustA twist on David Copperfield, focusing on an Appalachian boy whose life is overshadowed by the opioid epidemic? That sounds like a fantastic idea. And Kingsolver does a great job crafting Demon Copperhead's voice, making the resourceful boy (and later young man) sound witty, empathetic, and engaging, infusing his whole vibe with some The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and To Kill a Mockingbird. Of course we're also dealing with an important topic, and Kingsolver is here to give the overlooked and left-behind a voice - but this is where the problem starts. I am not at all saying that a successful, famous writer is generally unable to convey what it means to be a person like destitute Demon in the rural South, it just doesn't work very well in this particular text, and the reason can be found in the plot itself: While Kingsolver has a lot of empathy for her characters and is obviously very upset about the societal situation - this book is rooted in her impetus for change -, everything that happens to Demon is already present in the readers' preconceived notions of socially unstable, ""backwards"" Appalachia: Teenage single mom with substance abuse issues who dies? Check. Mean step-dad? Check. Abuse in the foster system? Check. Demon gets addicted to opioids? Check.Sure, the language is often evocative due to the strong narrator Demon, but at the end of the day, Kingsolver activates stereotypes that already exist in the readers' repertoire, and then adds some social commentary (capitalism is bad; rural communities deserve respect; the Sackler family is trash, etc.), so we all can feel like we are standing on the correct side, that we who are reading this are the good ones. This unchallenging outrage activism, no matter how well-intentioned, has a tendency to be patronizing and to serve as a narcissistic tool of moral self-assurance. It's, to put it bluntly, intellectually lazy, and it certainly does not help to show people from Appalachia in a new, more nuanced light - on the contrary: It only tells us what we already believe to be true.I, for once, want literature to challenge my beliefs, especially regarding communities I am not familiar with, so groups of people that only exist as reflections in my head to begin with (I am German, but I think Appalachia is a region that is unfamiliar to many Americans as well). When a novel relies so heavily on widespread notions and then adds clichéd narrative devices (of course Demon, in the most classic of all classic Bildungsroman motifs, is also an artist; and there is the tragic twist; and a football coach; and the good-hearted grandmother, ... *argh*), it becomes rather annoying, especially because this novel is way, way, way too long. Boy, it is long. It's insane. It just goes on. And on. And then it goes on. And finally, the ending is pure kitsch. So I guess this has solid chances to get Booker-nominated as the Oprah book club crowd-pleaser with the socially relevant message that outstays its welcome and is of dubious literary merit. If so, I'm glad that I can already cross it off my list. Demon as a character is great though."
5,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5512657-sara,Rating 2 out of 5,"I waited a long time to get my turn for this book from the library. I was anticipating it with relish, because several of my trusted friends had loved it and said they, like me, had not enjoyed Kingsolver’s last few books. I was all prepared to be swept away, and I was in the beginning, but Demon has a voice that captivates you and then wears on you and then wears you out.At least Kingsolver wasn’t preaching to me in this book, but she did seem to be in love with the sound of her own voice, because she wrote pages and pages on subjects that could have sufficed with much less, and she repeated herself endlessly regarding both the lousy DSS system, the details of drug addiction, and the hopelessness of anyone who is born in the hills of Appalachia. At some point, for me, that hopelessness became a bit like the prejudice she seemed to be railing against.The first 200 pages of this book were somewhat enchanting, the middle was a slog, and the ending was not enough to make up for that. It was not a bad read, but not the 5-star read I had hoped for. Perhaps in the end, you cannot tell someone else’s story as well as they do. David Copperfield is 10-star material, Kingsolver transformed it into something just a tad over okay.I had said to myself once before that Kingsolver and I were done with one another, but this book tempted me back for another try. This time, I think, the breakup is permanent. So many other authors I want to give a fair chance.If you have the stomach for the endless beating of the opioid drum, this book will be for you. There are meant to be redeeming moments at the end, promises of better lives for a few, but those seem more like dreams, while the sinking and despair that consumed ninety percent of this book seemed all too real."
6,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4125660-liz,Rating 5 out of 5,"I love Barbara Kingsolver, so I picked this as our book club selection. Then, I had the bright idea that since this was based on David Copperfield, I should try reading that first. 800 pages, dry as dirt, and I gave up at page 200. That had me worried. Until the first page of this book. OMG! The language! Her way with words is beyond description. I wanted to highlight multiple phrases per page. I quickly realized I’d be highlighting the whole book. I found myself getting caught up time after time by some phrase or sentence. She just tells it so you really understand something. This book sucked me in. Demon’s life was one long sorrowful moan. But not just his. Almost everyone in this tale has had trouble. This is a deeply depressing book. But thank heavens it ends on a note of hope for those still standing at the end. I was impressed that Kingsolver was able to take this re-telling of David Copperfield and make it about the opioid crisis in Appalachia. It shows that not much has changed between Victorian times and now when it comes to the disadvantaged being marginalized and ignored. It starts with an area with little on offer, government programs stretched beyond its limits and first one, then another, industry more interested in profits than people. The plot is a reminder that severe poverty isn’t just limited to the inner cities. If anything, there's as much prejudice against the “trailer trash”. “A blight on the nation…a smudge on the map.” I highly recommend this and it is definitely one of my favorite books of the year. I can’t wait to discuss this at book club."
7,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may,Rating 2 out of 5,"I think it is finally time for me to part ways with Kingsolver's books for good. I loved The Poisonwood Bible back in the day, then hated Unsheltered, and all the hype plus my love of David Copperfield convinced me to try this one... but I'm just not feeling whatever magic everyone else did.I found the characters in Demon Copperhead to be utterly soulless and forgettable. Demon tells his life story and the narration reads like ""this happened and then this happened and then this happened"", making it impossible for me to become immersed in the story being told. Many reviewers have commented on how emotionally-connected they felt, but sadly I felt the complete opposite.The more I think about this book, the more I dislike it. I dislike how every cliched predictable thing that could happen, happens. Kid born to a junkie mom-- guess what happens? Kid gets a new stepfather-- guess what happens? Kid goes into foster care-- guess what happens? Kid becomes a star footballer-- guess what happens? Kid gets prescribed oxy-- guess what happens? Kid gets a junkie girlfriend-- guess what happens? In comes a ferocious but charming dog-- guess what fucking happens?There was a point in the middle of this book, deep in the longest dullest stretch, where Demon meets a character and I knew, I just knew, exactly what would happen to them. It's like one of those country songs that is so tragic it's slightly comical.Critics have been fawning over this book like it's such a feat of literary fiction when it literally combines every single hillbilly tragedy trope into one life story. And still, somehow, manages to be boring! Give me Bastard Out of Carolina over this any day."
8,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1232712-matt,Rating 5 out of 5,"“The wonder is that you could start life with nothing, end with nothing, and lose so much in between…”-	Barbara Kingsolver, Demon CopperheadBarbara Kingsolver’s Demon Copperhead is my favorite type of novel. Big and messy and sprawling; funny and tense and sad; and written by an author whose talents are awe-inspiring. This is an ambitious work, replete with striking tonal shifts, a memorable cast of secondary characters, and powerful set pieces. It has an old-fashioned feel, a bildungsroman that begins with the birth of its main character – Damon Fields, whose nickname gives the book its title – and follows him throughout a tumultuous journey into a premature adulthood. It is wildly imperfect, but its imperfections suit a larger purpose, mirroring the life it is trying to capture.As long as Demon Copperhead is – and at 560 pages, it’s pretty long – when you get to the last page, you want to keep on going. Kingsolver has created a very particular world, inhabited it with people you can’t forget, and coerced from me an emotional investment that I’m not often willing to make in fiction. *** The first – and most obvious – thing to be said about Demon Copperhead is that it is a retelling of Charles Dickens’s David Copperfield, transplanted from nineteenth century England to rural Virginia during the ravages of the Purdue Pharma-sponsored opioid epidemic. It is not necessary to have read Dickens’s ponderous classic – I’ll admit, I’m only halfway through, and taking a lengthy break – and in some ways, it’s probably better that you have not. In particular, those who’ve read the original will have a very good idea about the direction Kingsolver is going, and some of the twists and turns are the same as they were over 170 years ago.On the other hand, those who are familiar with the Dickens version will have a good time matching the characters and the plot-points. Dickens’s Uriah Heep, for example, is marvelously transformed by Kingsolver into a creepy assistant football coach. *** Like David Copperfield, Demon Copperhead is an episodic novel, told in the first-person by our hero, a scrappy and resilient youngster for whom the past is as mysterious as the future. He is born poor in the Appalachian Mountains, to a teenage mother with substance abuse issues. Demon’s lengthy arc consists of his attempts to navigate the minefields of poverty, child protective services, drug use, foreshortened opportunities, and – of course – love. To say much more would be to say too much. It should suffice that Kingsolver does a fantastic job of utilizing a modified serial approach, so that the forward momentum of Demon Copperhead is always urging you to read just one more page. *** One of Dickens’s shortcomings – at least in my opinion – is the essential blandness of his main protagonists. It often felt like the chief focus fell on the least interesting person in his books. That is not a problem here. Demon is a fascinating creation, and holds the center from first to last. He narrates his tale in a low-key idiom that is stylized without being inaccessible. I don’t know whether Kingsolver was trying to achieve an authentic colloquial expression, and – if she was – I’m in no position to say whether she was successful. The important thing, for me, is that Demon maintained a consistent and engaging voice.From the start, we are rooting for Demon to succeed. To Kingsolver’s credit, though, she allows him to be flawed. There are moments when he is unlikeable, selfish, self-involved, and borderline awful. Allowing him these dimensions gives him a far deeper humanity than might otherwise have been achieved. That said, Kingsolver often runs into two different literary traps that I have wholly invented. The first I like to call the Idiot-Genius Paradox, wherein a character is high-functioning, intelligent, and capable, right up to the point where the storyline requires him or her to do something stupid. There is a corollary to this trap for children – let’s call it the Selectively Precocious Child Conundrum – when an author chooses to narrate a story through a youngster whose behavior and actions have only a tenuous relation to their developmental age. This is a long way of saying that one of the conceits you have to swallow is that Demon – especially early in the novel – would be able to reason and express himself at such an extraordinarily high level, given his supposed minority. And also that these preternatural talents will randomly disappear for drama’s sake.*** The constellation of people around Demon is head-spinning. When we think of Dickens – if we think of Dickens, that is – we tend to recall his unforgettable supporting casts. At least, that’s been my experience. In Demon Copperhead, Kingsolver carries on that tradition admirably. Almost everyone who walks across Demon’s path makes an impression. Just a short list includes his mother, struggling with her addictions; an abusive stepfather who mistakes his cruelty for teaching; a child support worker with one eye on the door; an exploitative foster father trying to keep his farm afloat; a hilarious man-hating old woman; and a football coach willing to cut a few corners to achieve the status of local legend. This doesn’t even include Demon’s love interests, or Sterling “Fast Forward” Ford, who is so deftly, frighteningly drawn that I am certain that whoever plays him in the movie will earn an Oscar. *** Carrying on the Dickensian tradition of social criticism, Kingsolver becomes the latest author to attempt an explanation for the failures of the rural white working class. She does this with varying levels of success. At its best, Demon Copperhead paints a vivid picture of an overstressed child support division, schools that care more about athletics than academics, and people who can’t see a way forward. Especially effective is the interweaving of oxycontin into the storylines. It begins as a background presence, then explodes into the open, revealing a hellscape of pill farms and profit-mad drug reps working through profit-mad doctors, both in service to a rapacious corporation, leaving behind hollowed-out users cycling through withdrawal, if they’re lucky enough to survive.Unfortunately, there are times when Demon Copperhead slips into half-conceived lectures implying that rural folk are stuck because the rest of the country is being mean to them. This is less than convincing, but maybe I’m a bit fatigued from this dialogue, which has been racing in circles since 2016. In short, I’m over trying to understand people who don’t seem that interested in understanding me. *** For all their detail, Dickens’s novels always felt a tad sanitized. His slums, while slummy, were basically false, shorn of cursing, sex, violence, and excretory filth.Demon Copperhead has all those missing elements, many times over. So, be aware of that. *** When I finish a book, I never have the chance to write about it immediately. Days – even weeks – can elapse before I try to put my thoughts into complete sentences that are at least adjacent to grammatical soundness. This interim is often a good indicator of my true feelings for a book. It gives me a period to decide if my initial response – possibly skewed by the adrenal rush of finishing – holds up to reflection. When I finished Demon Copperhead, it had me breathless. That sensation remains.There are moments, weeks later, when I find myself thinking about all the different people I met, and wondering where they went, how they’re doing, and if they’re going to be okay. I’ve even found myself staring at the finished book on my shelf, pondering whether I should open it again, just to check on everyone one last time."

Set in the mountains of Southern Appalachia….(a neglected area of Virginia’s Appalachian Mountains)The area is home to Barbara today.A little about Barbara Kingsolver:  ….not only is she a best selling author of America contemporary novels, nonfiction, and poetry, but she is also a freelance journalist and political activist. With skillful talent, her writing encourages a more just world….current social issues, environmental issues, human rights, and deeply traumatic dilemmas.Her protagonists tend to be resilient— surviving day-to-day struggles…..she does this with humor to lighten the tone — love — strength —and hope. Her storytelling — mixed with political and social passion—“hope to leave the world a little more reasonable and just”….are wonderfully intimate, emotional, heartbreaking and heart endearing stories.I was a huge fan of Kingsolver’s early books…”The Bean Trees”, “Animal Dreams”, and “Pigs in Heaven”, ….that took place in Arizona where she lived for many years.When “The Poisonwood Bible” came out in 2009….(a fairly new experience for me in styling: each character taking their turn to tell the story— felt so fresh and revolutionary to me)…..taking place in Africa. I was so taken so affected by the storytelling itself…..it’s a book that has never left me. But….I have never yet read any other book that I felt accomplished that type of narrative —(a narrative circle of family characters)….I thought it was soooo brilliant….yet, since 2009, I’ve read many more authors who adopted the TAKE TURNS styling, but for me, most of the time they have a ‘paint-by-numbers’ quality to me.NOT Barbara Kingsolver! For me, she was the Queen creator of unique ‘narrative-circle’. Her crafting felt inventive & primitive — fitting to the jungle setting where a Baptist preacher took his wife and four daughters. So….clearly “The Poisonwood Bible” is still my favorite Kingsolver book…..but…..”Demon Copperhead” —with a rapturous and heroically protagonist—comes in as a very close 2nd favorite.I couldn’t agree more with this statement: “Demon is a voice for the ages—akin to Huck Finn or Holden Caulfield—only even more resilient”. Demon Copperhead reflects social and political viewpoints through realistic characters. The socioeconomic messages are felt throughout….but…it’s the nitty-gritty-bigger-than-life-immersive storytelling— with Demon ‘telling-this story’…..looking back on his coming-of-age life….that unabashedly delves into the hearts and souls of her characters — exposing something so raw and tender. Humanity is being exposed! So….ABOUT …some of those ‘nitty-gritty’ details…. …..Some CHARM nitty gritty’s: ….like Demon’s love for snicker bars, comics, and playing spitball with other orphan kids…..Some MAKE YOUR HEART ACHE nitty gritty’s: …..like being born into poverty by a teenage-single mother. Being tossed around from one Foster Care home to another, each worse than the next….no socks, no winter coat, lots of child labor —scrubbing and cleaning, cuttin tobacco, being called a “dead junkie’s kid”, taking crap from teachers, bullying kids, laughed at by girls, hunger….(so much hunger), opioid addiction, (damn—it was everywhere in those Appalachia mountains), ….Yet…..people were saying “a cripple was a punishment from God”?….. (what’s wrong with people?)It’s the tossing of a sentence here or there — that will spark-a-fire-in readers ‘feeling’ ANGER FOR THE CONDITIONS of life —I CAN’T IMAGINE ANY READER NOT FINDING THIS NOVEL FULLY ABSORBING—and DEEPLY AFFECTING-The full range of emotions are felt from birth into Demon’s adulthood.There are numerous themes and plot lines to contemplate….Demon’s tiny, pretty, mom, for example — she was not a bad person — she just wasn’t well. Looking through the eyes of Demon — he held onto the best parts of his mom. He loved being told that he was the best thing that ever happened to her. Demon was not only a likable child — but a forgiving character to boot (to a point)….But when his mother went and re-married a man named Stoner >>a beast of an abusive jerk, he only made Demon’s hard knock life worse.In one dialogue conversation— Demon was asked, “what he might like to do when he got older?” His replay…..was, “huh?, live”….To be a growing child with fear — to serious worry if whether or not you will survive to adulthood — let alone indulge a smudge of freedom— a taste of the American dream…is gut-wrenching. Love and hate are interwoven dangerously close together. We get clear visuals of the issues of our modern day American foster care system: homeless neglected children— victims of violence, abuse, and drug addictions are rampant. Children competing for food, hoarding food, and fighting for personal hygiene items is devastating. …..and is still a real issue. Demon was smart — he could read — draw - (superheroes of course) …and in some ways he was considered a ‘poverty- prodigy’ of sorts. But with so much abuse, addiction, poverty, betrayal all around him, without safety nets…. impoverished communities…it would take a miracle to come out on top. The ending is hopeful ……but before we get to the end —we journey through loss of innocence, alienation, isolation, cynicism, farm work, sarcasm, history, schools, shame, current events, social events, good versus evil, perseverance,— we meet other impactful characters influencing Demon’s life…(friends, Tommy, Emmy, Betsy, Dick,) Mrs. Peggot (a kind neighbor) — later in High School Coach Winfield and daughter Agnes….a football accident, a very powerful funeral that triggered memories of my own father’s funeral (he was 34- I was 4), —ongoing coming-of-age tales —New Years, new jobs, summer vacations, a love interest, Dorie, the girl Demon falls in love with ( a complicated drug-related relationship)…..It’s too easy to get to a point in life …..”where you don’t give a damn if people are thinking that you are worthless”.Everything about this book is remarkable … The descriptions, the insights, the plot structure, the treacherous hardships, epic, epic epic..stunning—- beautiful and brilliantly written! Pulitzer Prize quality!As Demon himself might say…..”Shit, and Hallelujah”! He told a damn good story!"

11,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3639005-candi,Rating 3 out of 5,"Demon Copperhead is said to be inspired by David Copperfield, a masterpiece I read a couple of years ago. I most definitely can see that inspiration in Kingsolver’s novel. I would be hesitant, however, to make any further comparisons because for me that puts a contemporary novel on shaky ground when setting it next to a classic, beloved book. I can somehow forgive Charles Dickens for his verbosity. After all, that was the vogue back in his day. David Copperfield was a series of installments, stretched out over a period of time. He didn’t get paid by the word but by installment; still, he had a lot of mouths to feed. Barbara Kingsolver, on the other hand, could have done with a lot less, and I would have been a much happier reader for it. That’s not to say that her points are less important than Dickens’ themes. She absolutely had good reason to share what she did here. “That November it was still a shiny new thing. OxyContin, God’s gift for the laid-off deep-hole man with his back and neck bones grinding like bags of gravel. For the bent-over lady pulling double shifts at Dollar General with her shot knees and ADHD grandkids to raise by herself. For every football player with some of this or that torn up, and the whole world riding on his getting back in the game. This was our deliverance. The tree was shaken and yes, we did eat of the apple.”But this isn’t only about drugs and pharmaceutical companies and shady doctors taking advantage of a whole group of people. It’s also about the foster care system and how it fails those most in need of protection. It’s about the long reach of the coal mine owners and how their power reverberated across the years, affecting everything in these individual’s lives from wages to education to property and more. Someone should be held accountable, and that’s where I find Kingsolver’s work to be admirable, without a doubt. However, I still couldn’t get the author out of my head while reading this story - despite the fact it was supposedly told through a young boy-turned-young adult’s point of view. I’ve read and loved some of Kingsolver’s earlier work but have had difficulty with more of her “recent” work for the same reason. If I sense the writer sitting next to me on the couch while I read, I get a little cranky. I would much rather feel like his or her characters are having a nice heart to heart with me instead. And that brings me to another niggle - Demon’s “voice” throughout the book. I just couldn’t jibe with it. It got on my nerves A LOT!“If a mother is lying in her own piss and pill bottles while they’re slapping the kid she’s shunted out, telling him to look alive: likely the bastard is doomed. Kid born to the junkie is a junkie. He’ll grow up to be everything you don’t want to know, the rotten teeth and dead-zone eyes, the nuisance of locking up your tools in the garage so they don’t walk off, the rent-by-the-week motel squatting well back from the scenic highway.”I don’t mind gritty but what I couldn’t quite wrap my head around was who on earth is speaking these words? Supposedly, this is Demon as a young boy at the start of the story (the above passage occurs on page 2). Is this a super savvy kid speaking? Or is it Demon as an old man looking back and narrating? Or is it Kingsolver trying really hard to create a voice she feels is authentic? I don’t know, honestly. But it happened over and over again to me throughout the 500+ pages. It's like nails on a chalkboard!Okay, I’ll lay off the complaining now. This is, after all, a 3-star book in my mind so there has to be another good thing or two, right?! What I loved most were the strong women in Demon’s life. Without them, I’m afraid to imagine Demon’s fate. In these Appalachia stories, I’ve often found that the women are the ones holding down the fort. It’s their strength and perseverance in the face of adversity that forms a safety net for those they care for most. And I can see where these women equate to those in Dickens’ story as well. This makes for a bit of fun, but you surely don’t need to read his book to understand this one. It just adds another level perhaps. There’s even a passage in here where Demon nods to that famous work.“I had to do the harder English, which was a time suck, reading books. Some of them though, I finished without meaning to… Likewise the Charles Dickens one, seriously older guy, dead and a foreigner, but Christ Jesus did he get the picture on kids and orphans getting screwed over and nobody giving a rat’s ass. You’d think he was from around here.”I’ll say that this is an important topic to explore. Personally, it would work better if it had been edited more thoroughly. Yes, a shorter story can still make a huge impact. I also think a non-fiction piece on the opioid crisis would be a lot more effective for me. I know they are out there, and I will explore that option more thoroughly. Now, would I have loved this more if Richard Armitage had been reading it to me as he did David Copperfield? Damn straight I would have!! He could have read another 500 pages of this one to me and I’d have been content.“It hit me pretty hard, how there’s no kind of sad in this world that will stop it turning.”"

13,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27456036-barbara,Rating 5 out of 5,"5+I am far from the first one to be blown away by this phenomenal book. How can one novel be heart-breaking, beautiful, amazing, poignant, and funny? Barbara Kingsolver lives in these mountains she writes about, this area of southern Appalachia that is a place of immense beauty but which is known more for its poverty, unemployment, and addiction. The Appalachian people, people who are often ridiculed for their rural ways and particular speech.“All down the years, words have been flung like pieces of shit, only to get stuck on a truck bumper with up-yours pride. Rednecks, moonshiners, ridgerunners, hicks, deplorables.”Kingsolver writes from the heart with love and understanding. She has written many fine books but, in my opinion, this is her best since The Poisonwood Bible.Rather than retell the story (No! No! Please don’t!), I will share some of my favorite quotes. Please realize these are just a sampling of the many I might have included.“The wonder is that you could start life with nothing, end up with nothing, and lose so much.”“I wanted to go home, which was nowhere, but it’s a feeling you keep having, even after that’s no place anymore.”“I’d live long enough to know shit doesn’t bounce off.”“Certain pitiful souls around here see whiteness as their last asset that hasn’t been totaled or repossessed.”“A junkie catches his flight. That sugar on your brain cells sucks away any other purpose. The human person you were gets yanked out through whatever hole the devil can find.”“I thought about what Rose said, wanting to see the rest of us hurt, because she was hurting. You have to wonder how much of this whole world’s turning is fueled by that very fire.”“That’s the deal of sober life: celebrate the fresh start, suck up your sadness for all that was left behind”.I hope those who haven’t read this masterpiece will love it too."

Part coming of age, part social commentary, the narrative revolves around the eponymous Demon Copperhead, born Damon Fields, (named after his father Damon, who died from an accident before his birth, earning the nickname “Copperhead” on account of his copper wire hair) to an addict mother in a trailer park in Lee County, Virginia. We follow Demon from his childhood through his early adulthood, as he grapples with poverty, loss, abuse, loneliness, and short-lived moments of hope and success as a young athlete with college dreams before an injury derails his plans and his struggle with addiction and substance abuse. Narrated in the first person by Demon, as he shares his perspective on the people and events that shape his life and his worldview, this is a story of grief, resilience and ultimately the search for a sense of belongingness and the will to survive when the odds are stacked against you. “It hit me pretty hard, how there’s no kind of sad in this world that will stop it turning. People will keep on wanting what they want, and you’re on your own.”Rather than compare this novel to the classic that inspired this story, I prefer to discuss what I felt about this book based on its individual merit.There is a lot to unpack here. The author writes with compassion in simple yet elegant prose. Barbara Kingsolver not only paints the picture of the lives of those caught up in a vicious cycle of poverty, neglect and addiction, the Opioid Crisis in particular but also takes a grim look at issues such as parental negligence, child abuse and the foster care system among others. The characterizations are superb and the author skillfully weaves a large cast of distinctive characters into the narrative without it becoming overwhelming or too difficult to follow. The author also addresses how outsiders harbor certain preconceived notions about certain communities without totally understanding the challenges they face.I was engrossed in Demon's journey for the first half of this novel, after which the repetitiveness caused the pace to falter but it does pick up in the last quarter of the story. There are segments in the narrative that I felt were unnecessarily detailed and could have been shorter without affecting the overall impact of the novel. Though the story is dark and depressing for the most part, it is peppered with moments of humor and hope amid the bleakness that pervades Demon’s life and ends on a hopeful note. This was my first Barbara Kingsolver novel and I look forward to exploring more of her work. “But where did it come from, this wanting disease? From how I got born, or the ones that made me, or the crowd I ran with later? Everybody warns about bad influences, but it’s these things already inside you that are going to take you down. The restlessness in your gut, like tomcats gone stupid with their blood feuds, prowling around in the moon- dead dark. The hopeless wishes that won’t quit stalking you: some perfect words you think you could say to somebody to make them see you, and love you, and stay.”"

Even the ones that don't exist.Many years ago, shortly after I started working at my library, I mentioned to a colleague I had a headache.""Mabel"", sweet and helpful as ever, said to come back to her desk and she'd give me something for it. She pulled out a gallon-size Ziploc bag (that's almost 4 liters, for all the non-United Statians reading this).Mabel asked me what kind did I want. 'Um, ibuprofen?' I queried, not seeing anything but orange prescription bottles in that see-through plastic bag.She looked at me and said she didn't have it but any of these pills would help a lot more than ibuprofen would. I declined, worried to take prescription painkillers. I worried for her, seeing that big ol' bag.""You don't take all of these, do you, Mabel?"", I asked. She said well of course she did, ""Jenna, when you get old, you get a lot of different pains and each of these are for a different one"". With that, Mabel began pulling out bottles, reading the labels as she did. ""This here's for my neck. This for my back. Oh, this is the best, it helps my arthritis,"" she said, shaking a bottle of Oxys. She continued pulling out bottles, lining them up on the edge of her desk. I think just about every part of her body hurt and every part of her body had its own pill.A white-haired, intelligent, professionally employed woman, Mabel wasn't your stereotypical addict. She had been a librarian for decades, the favorite of most of our patrons. But, like every other pain pill addict I knew, Mabel's addiction began in the doctor's office. She wasn't some lowlife just looking to get high. She trusted her doctors and believed them that you couldn't get addicted if you really had pain.There are so many stories about addiction, some true, some based on the truth. Mabel, while not her real name, was a real person with a real addiction that probably killer her (she had a brain aneurysm which are often brought on by opioids). Not all stories have happy endings. As for this book and this story, I loved it. Loved it in so many ways and for so many reasons. Barbara Kingsolver, being Appalachian, ""gets"" Appalachians, us hillbillies. She writes with so much authenticity. These characters? I know them. They live down the street, they come in the library, they shop at Walmart, pushing their ""buggies"" full of sugar drinks and sugar cereals, trying to get the most amount of calories for their kids for the least amount of dollars.Ms. Kingsolver also ""gets"" the pain pill/heroin epidemic, how and why it started, and how greedy pharmaceutical CEOs and everyone under them, down to both the equally greedy doctors and the well-meaning but witless ones, destroyed hundreds of thousands of lives.There is a lot about addiction in these pages, but there's so much more than that. It is real and deep and emotional and rip-your-heart-out stuff. It is what Hillbilly Elegy could have been if JD Vance wasn't such a stuck on himself braggart asshole. Young Demon Copperhead had me from the very first page. I knew this kid, I'd seen him grow up, and watched him grow up all over again through the pages of this book. I cannot praise it highly enough, trite as those words are. It's difficult to find words to describe it - again trite, but the truth. If you want a book that is going to suck you in and hold you rapt and take you on a roller coaster of emotions, Demon Copperhead is the book for you. Don't be intimidated by the length. As another friend wrote in her review (hey, Diane 👋🏼), ""it needs every word to get this story told."""
16,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5349403-carolyn-walsh,Rating 5 out of 5,"The excellent cover design first drew me to this book. I thought a modern adaptation of the classic David Copperfield would be a formidable task. When I saw it was written by Barbara Kingsolver, who wrote three of my favourite books, all wildly different in theme and location, The Poisonwood Bible, The Lacuna, and Flight Behaviour, I knew I wanted to purchase and read this. This is unlike her other books that enthralled me. It is an epic tale (over 600 pages) and a fabulous read. Its characters, the good, the wicked, the uncaring, and the disinterested, will stay in my memory for a long time. Demon (Damon) Copperhead was born to a teenage, addicted mother on the floor of her trailer. They faced extreme poverty in the Appalachian mountains of Virginia. The story follows Demon from his birth to young manhood. The writing is exquisite, although describing dark and disturbing circumstances. Demon narrates his life story, often with a sardonic sense of humour about deplorable situations. His father died before his birth, and Demon inherited his father's good looks and flaming red hair (Copperhead). His mother remarried a vile, abusive, violent man. Kindly neighbours, the Piggotts, were an early refuge for him, and the family also cared for other orphaned or forgotten children from dead or absent relatives. At age ten, Demon finds himself in the foster system when his mother dies. The system's workers were overburdened and usually uncaring, overlooking terrible situations where they placed their charges. He finds himself working on a farm with several orphaned boys, treated as slave labour, poisoned by the sap from tobacco plants, and nearly starved. Then he is moved to the McCobbs, sleeping in a dog's room, and expected to earn money by working outside the home to supplement the family's income. He rarely can attend school, and when he does, it reinforces his low self-esteem. Always hungry and poorly dressed, he is shunned by his classmates. He works in the trash after school and seldom is clean. Things start to look better when he moves into the home of a football coach who is determined to make a football player out of Demon for his winning team. He feels unworthy even in his short glory days as a football player. A painful injury on the sports field ends his brief football career and starts him on pain medication and the road to addiction. He becomes friends with Angus, the coach's teenager.  Demon becomes reacquainted with an old friend from the miserable farm where they both laboured. This friend works for a local newspaper laying out ads and cartoon strips. Demon helps him by creating a superhero from the Appalachian region, as all the superheroes are drawn with their exploits in cities. The cartoon strip became very popular and is syndicated to other regional papers. One kindly art teacher recognizes Demon's talent for drawing cartoons and supports his efforts. However, things are going badly for Demon outside the newspaper office. He has married a girl he thinks is adorable. She is clingy and needy, will not cook or clean the house, and appliances have long stopped functioning. They live in filthy, nasty conditions, and she has fallen deep into drug addiction. She becomes distraught and angry if he leaves home to run errands or go to work. His memories of earlier injustices and poverty flood his mind and emotions with despair.  His old friends are now part of the opioid and meth crisis, and Demon joins them. His best friend from the Piggott home is far into drugs and weird Gothic dress, and he and the once popular QB football hero are dealing. Former friends start dying from overdoses and reckless behaviour. Are there any supportive people who will save some of the addicted youth? Will Demon find a way out of his tragic past?  We learn something about the region's history, the coal mining, those impoverished, marginalized people scorned by others and designated hillbillies and rednecks. ( a word with an interesting origin),and with social situations little improved since the time of Charles Dickens.  Demon comments on David Copperfield, one of the few books he managed to read in school, "" The Charles Dickens one seriously old guy, dead and a foreigner, but Christ Jesus did he get the picture on kids and orphans getting screwed over, and nobody gives a rat's ass. You'd think he was from around here."" Highly recommended!"

You get to know the people in these books better, maybe see them grow over a longer period of time. You get to know the whole world of the book better. But that makes it even sadder when you finish it.I loved this book, a modern Appalachian retelling of David Copperfield, another very long book that I really liked. Kingsolver is good at both seriousness and playfulness, as Dickens was, and she cares deeply about backwoods, rocky Virginia. This works for me, too- I never lived in Appalachia, but I have deep family roots in West Virginia, and I care about that part of the world. I got invested in young Demon (a nickname for Damon) quickly and cared about him all the way through. Even when he makes awful mistakes in this book, he’s a loving person, and I think his worst mistakes are made out of love. He’s good at making connections with people who might save him, too, and he’s generous with the people in his life even when things are unbelievably hard. I like how Demon, even when he’s going through something terrible, notices and is buoyed by the beauty of the natural world. The sense of place is strong in this book. The characters are even stronger, and you care about them deeply as they suffer in the eye of the opioid storm that still wracks our country. I’ve read almost all of Kingsolver’s books, and I think this has replaced The Poisonwood Bible as my favorite. As always when I’m truly loving a book, I worried about the ending. Would the author stick the landing? I am haunted by the ghosts of a few books that just lost it at the end. But she stuck the landing! I love where the book ends.Now I kind of feel like going back and rereading David Copperfield? It’s been a while. Thanks to NetGalley for giving me early access to my favorite book of the year."

You’d think that he was from around here.”  A modern retelling of Charles Dickens's David Copperfield bildungsroman set in the Appalachian Mountains, where you are plunged into a harsh and unforgiving world of institutional poverty, addiction, and social injustice. Through the eyes of Damon Fields, nicknamed ""Demon Copperhead,"" Kingsolver exposes the dark underbelly of modern American society with a raw and visceral prose, with a bleak and apocalyptic vision of the world that is both terrifying and all too familiar. “Once a time I was something, and then I turned, like sour milk. The dead junkie’s kid. A rotten piece of American pie that everybody wishes could just be, you know. Removed.”Kingsolver's sprawling narrative weaves together a complex tapestry of characters and storylines that reflect the harsh realities of contemporary life. Her storyline is unflinching, painting a picture of a society that has lost its way and is struggling to find its moral compass; a long tradition of suffering that divides and isolates. Kingsolver's socio-political message is complemented by the splendid prose and southern undertones which contribute to the realistic representation of the simple, ordinary life of the mind of a teenage boy and his upbringing in the harsh Appalachian environment. This is a heartfelt exploration of the search for meaning in a chaotic word. The fate of Demon, a throwdown of shame, a cesspool of self-pity, will intersect with that of many others, echoing the stories of all those haunted by the ghosts of a repressive past. “The wonder is that you could start life with nothing, end with nothing, and lose so much in between.”In the end, as you embark on this journey with Demon through loss of innocence, alienation, isolation, cynicism, but also of fortitude and perseverance, you are reminded of the timeless truths that lie at the heart of all great stories.

I knew by page 50 that it would be five stars, by page 75 my favorite book of the year. Having finished, I'm moving it up to one of my lifetime favorite books. It really is that good, that moving, that perfect. That's a lot from an author that had disappointed me with her last few books. Kingsolver never got past her wonderful Poisonwood Bible success with me, and after a couple of later books, I just gave up on her. I wanted to try this because of the David Copperfield connection. I last read that in high school,many long years ago, but give Dickens credit, I still remembered the plot and the characters, and of course, their names. Kingsolver takes David/Demon and plops him down in present day Appalachia, and never misses a beat. Having said that, even if you never even heard of David Copperfield, this is a great novel on its own.I'll let the GR blurb give you the basics. Just get this book in your hands and read it. I will even go so far as to say it will probably win everything, certainly the National Book Award, most likely the Pulitzer. It will certainly win your heart. I got mine from the library, but will buy a copy when it comes out in paperback.

Taking place in Southern Appalachia rather than Victorian England the same set of horrifying tragedies still exist with the addition of the opioid crisis that particularly plagues the south. As you might imagine this is not a cheerful read but it provides a scathing look at a forgotten population told by a perceptive and canny red-haired kid who has had more than his share of poverty, starvation, crummy foster homes and losses. He is a hero worth rooting for. A must read."

This is Demon’s story. He tells his story starting from the day he was born to a teenage mother too young to know anything about parenting and too focused on getting her next fix of alcohol, drugs and bad men. Demon chronicles his life of poverty, foster care, crime, filth, abuse and loneliness. There are bright spots throughout the way, but nothing that could shine clear through the constant neglect and heartbreak this young boy faces.As dark and disturbing as this story is, it was a phenomenal reading experience for me. Truly - it was an exceptional and outstanding novel that surpassed any expectation I had. For me, the most stand out aspect was the narrative. Demon’s voice is one I’ll never forget. The author created a fascinating, impactful, endearing and heartbreaking character in Demon, giving him a voice that sent his story right to my heart. Demon’s narrative is raw and gritty. It’s filled with slang and backwoods grammar. It’s authentic and real and had me enraptured. There were many sentences of tender raw honesty from Demon that went straight to my heart.You’ll be able to quickly decide if this book is for you based on how you feel about Demon’s narrative. If you don’t connect with his voice and backwoods drawl within the first few pages, this won’t be for you. There is so much that happens within these pages. It is a dark, gritty, heartbreaking read. The endless cycle of poverty and abuse is depressing but a reality many children face. I appreciate getting this harrowing glance into this life as it makes me even more thankful for what I have and encourages me to help others as much as possible.Overall, this was a remarkable book that I highly recommend! I hope you connect with Demon’s story as much as I did."

Damon quickly morphs into Demon, and the name assigned to him, Copperhead, he chooses to continue to use as a tribute to his father, who died before he was born.For the first ten years of his life, Demon Copperhead lives a poverty-stricken, unorthodox childhood, albeit a happy, safe and fairly stable one. Until tragedy sees him being sent to a series of foster homes.Narrated entirely by Demon – his strength of character, enduring, resilience spirit, and ability to find humour in any situation that was thrown at him, made this an unforgettable read. The material was bleak, graphic, hard-hitting and honest, but comic relief injected into the writing prevented things from ever becoming too depressing to handle. Demon’s coming-of-age epic journey into adulthood saw me feeling every emotion under the sun. Modernised and loosely based on Charles Dickens, David Copperfield, which I’ve been meaning to read but haven’t yet gotten around to, therefore am unable to compare the two. To me, Demon Copperhead gave me This Tender Land by William Kent Krueger, and Lemony Snickel’s A Series of Unfortunate Events (sans magical fantasy) vibes. In fact, the writing itself was similar to William Kent Krueger (an author I love) although the tone was darker. Also, unlike Krueger’s work, there was profanity and salty language, which I can take-it-or-leave-it, but I know some don’t care for it, so thought I’d better mention it.I listened to the entire 633 pages via audio borrowed from Libby Overdrive, and the narrator, Charlie Thurston was the perfect choice to voice Demon Copperhead. His tone, emotion, and character accents really brought the written material to life, as well as heightened my amusement ever further than what reading it myself would have. The first 40% was exciting, addictive, and unforgettable. But, after that Demon’s character arc went in a direction that to me slowed the overall pace, and caused the book to drag. I really think that section could’ve been condensed down. At about 60% things did pick up again, but didn’t reach the impacting heights of first 300 pages.Mary Beth and I buddy read Demon Copperhead, and like many other reviewers she deemed it worthy of all the stars. Initially I felt the same, but the wheels slowly fell off for me as the book progressed. The subject matter was powerful and important, but if I’m honest, It all got a bit tired. I actually feel a bit guilty that I didn’t find the themes in the last half as impactful as I probably should have. I’d definitely recommend giving it a read though, especially given how strong the first 40% was, and because most who have read it have raved over it in its entirety."

Children who are labelled as society’s dregs and treated as if they are in some way lesser beings because their clothes are ragged and they are always hungry. Damon Fields, nicknamed Demon Copperhead (for his red hair), is a child born to a single teenage mother living in a trailer, his father dead before his birth, in Lee County in the Virginian Appalachians. While his mother struggles with drug addiction and is in and out of rehab, Demon is also cared for by the kindly Peggot family next door, grandparents bringing up their own grandson whose mother is in prison. He learns to love the wild forests, to hunt and fish and what it’s feels like to be part of a large family. However, when he is ten, Demon’s world really falls apart when his mother marries an abusive man with no interest in raising a child. This is the start of a downhill spiral for Demon that leads to the nightmare of foster care, where he is expected to work to earn his keep, never given enough to eat or provided with bigger clothing as he grows. After he hits his lowest point, a change in fortune will find him in a better place but, with a baggage of neglect, abuse and poverty, he’s not equipped to weather the storms still to come and is in danger of repeating the cycle of addiction and poverty.However, even at his lowest point Demon never loses his will to survive or to see the best in people. His ability to draw and conjure up superheros with the power to save the weak and downtrodden is his richest possession and along with his sense of humour and intelligence keeps him going in the toughest of times. This is a long book and I did find it slow down in the latter half when Kingsolver is fully laying out the causes and effects of the opiod crisis in America, particularly in marginalised populations, such as in poor rural areas where there is high unemployment and people are told they are worthless. However, sad and depressing Demon’s story is, it felt very real and hopefully will lead to better understanding of what it is to be caught up in poverty through no fault of your own, poorly educated and without hope and told you are worthless, with the lure of drugs one way to make it all go away for a while. Demon is a character I will not easily forget in this insightful and provocative novel. 4.5★With thanks to Faber & Faber via Netgalley for a copy to read"
28,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/730754-ken,Rating 2 out of 5,"It’s not often you look forward to Demons, but in this case, I was. All the sterling reviews on Goodreads! The fortuitous link to my favorite Dickens novel (David Copperfield)! The promise of one of my favorite genres, coming-of-age!Alas, it was not to be. At least not for me.It fell into that category of book that for some reason bothers me. The plot’s the thing, and we all love a good story. As for Kingsolver, she’s certainly capable of telling it. Trouble is, she told way more than I like. Not many “stop and zoom in” scenes. More ""this happened, then that happened."" And time rolls on as the narrative years slip by.Guess I’d rather read a book that covers all of a day or a weekend only. That’s me. These year-jumpers tend to leave characterization in the dust. That is, the characters have no soul, and when they have no soul, I have trouble investing (making the book bankrupt as a Silicon Valley Bank, if you’ll forgive the current event metaphor).In fairness, you can dismiss this review because I DNF, but I did make it to page 380 or so, and that’s more than halfway, by God, but I struggled to return to it each time I put it down. Instead, I looked at other books on my TBR shelf and they mocked me for pledging my allegiance in such a rote way. Soon I caved to the Sirens of “Life’s Too Short.” I don't feel that bad. Demon seems to be doing just fine and meeting unusual success and winning over all the girls and facing all the modern troubles (like opioids) David C. didn’t have to and I wish him well. But he really lacked depth. And the surrounding characters didn't sweep me off my feet, either, meaning I was always aware of my surroundings while reading (never a good thing -- consider the movie theater when the same thing happens while viewing!).So cue the music by the men in Wayfarer sunglasses (“I’m a Soul Man”) and forgive me not joining the Kingsolver parade. I’ll leave the 5-stars and hosannas to others with their marching band reviews. Instead, I’ll be one of the outsiders giving this a two. Leaving it has hard, but I’m glad I did now that the doing’s done."

True confession: I have never read David Copperfield, so I cannot compare this re-telling to the inspiration. That certainly did not take away from my enjoyment of the story. Demon Copperhead is the nickname given to the red-headed Damon Fields. Demon beautifully narrates the story of his life beginning with his birth to an 18-year-old drug-addicted mother, through his childhood followed by the trauma of the foster care system, to his own addiction, and ending with his recovery. 4.5-stars, rounded up."
31,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/91622714-rosh,Rating 2 out of 5,"In a Nutshell: A contemporary retelling of the Dickens’ epic, ‘David Copperfield’. True to the original in flow, but the rest left me with mostly negative feelings. Outlier opinion coming up. Story Synopsis:Think ‘David Copperfield’ in a modern-day hillbilly setting. Damon Fields was born to a teenage druggie mom in a trailer home. Because of the colour of his hair and his attitude towards life and people, he is nicknamed ‘Demon Copperhead.’ As Demon grows up in Lee County in the Virginian Appalachian region, he fights against his destiny and tries to make something of himself, though the odds keep going against him. The story comes to us in the first person perspective of Demon.I remember the dilemma I had faced while reviewing Lan Samantha Chang’s The Family Chao, which was a modern-day retelling of Dostoevsky’s The Brothers Karamazov. While her adaptation had been faithful to the original, the classic itself was not suitable to a modernisation by virtue of its themes and its philosophy. This made her novel seem highly stereotypical and even offensive.I face a similar conundrum this time, though Charles Dickens’ classic ‘David Copperfield’ is much more flexible towards an updated retelling because of its universal themes. If you have read the original epic, you will notice how faithfully and brilliantly Barbara Kingsolver has transported the characters to the Appalachian mountains. All the characters get a similar deal as in the original, albeit through a different approach thanks to the change in era and setting. The characters have been given somewhat similar names as their older counterparts. Murdstone becomes Muller Stone, Steerforth becomes Sterling ford, Dora turns into Dori, Tommy Traddles is now Tommy Waddell… This kind of writing choice makes it very easy for us to remember whom each new character is based upon. (That said, I was not at all happy to see my favourite Agnes being changed to ‘Angus’.) David Copperfield was the titular character’s coming-of-age story; Demon Copperhead is also a bindungsroman for its eponymous lead. Both characters are equally gutsy and equally judgemental. Both want to succeed despite the lemons life keeps throwing at them, and contrary to expectations, they do end up carving a niche for themselves in this haphazard world. The plot is also faithful to the original. No one’s destiny changes paths just because of the modernisation. This is both good and bad. Good because I really respect authors who retain the spirit of the original in their retellings. (There’s no point calling a work a retelling if you retain nothing of the base work except the character names, right?) Bad because you already know what’s going to happen to every single one of them! In other words, as a retelling, this book rates pretty high because it sticks to the format and still gives it enough of a twist to make it stand on its own as an independent work.Where the book failed for me is in its tawdry portrayal of the mountain people. Don’t get me wrong. Kingsolver is a master at settings, and this book is no exception. The mountains of Lee County come alive through her beautiful descriptions. But it was somewhat disappointing to see every possible stereotype about the locals make its way into this book. This is somewhat ironic because Demon tells us multiple times how he feels upset about the stereotypes outsiders have about his people, and then he goes on to live a life reiterating every single cliché through his own deeds, which sounds even worse when heard in first person. Drugs, alcohol, sex, cuss words, poverty, physical violence, domestic violence, social backwardness, racial discrimination ,… you name it and it is there in this book. I am not going to remark on how much of this might be based on reality as I have no first-hand experience of that culture and hence have no right to judge. But from the way it was portrayed, I got hardly any good vibes about the community, and that it is a sure sign that only hackneyed ideas were being thrown at us. Dickens’ work was also somewhat “misery porn” in style and slightly offensive against those not “physically perfect.” But as David Copperfield was written in the late 1840s, it gets away with this outdated style of writing. Demon Copperhead cannot use the era as an excuse. As it is a retelling, I am also taken aback by the amount of vulgarity in the story. This might not bother most readers, but to me, inserting crude content into a favourite classic story was akin to blasphemy. How would you feel about this book without knowing the original? Well, you might like it better as you won’t keep comparing the two works and will read this one on its own merit. So if you are okay with the ribald content and the vapid portrayal of the hillbilly people, this story *might* work better for you. Then again, the book is needlessly lengthy, because it skips nothing from the original plot. The start is appealing, but the middle is quite repetitive. The story stays stuck in this looped narrative until almost the very end, by which time I had lost all my patience with it. To me, the book feels like an epic writing achievement in some ways, transporting 1800s upper class London to a modern hillbilly setting. But in most other ways, it feels so unbelievably flat and so offensive to the original as well as to the contemporary dwellers of the location that I cannot endorse it wholeheartedly.2.5 stars, rounding down because I expected far more from Ms. Kingsolver. Do note that this is very much an outlier review. So please read other reviews and take a call on this joint-winner of the 2023 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Connect with me through:

32,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27304766-kay,Rating 3 out of 5,"Tragic and heartbreaking The story takes place mostly in southern Appalachian Lee County, Virginia where Demon (Damon) was born to a teen mother with addiction. He enters foster care and then lives with his football coach. The novel explores poverty, abuse, and addiction. Through it all, Demon is a survivor. I didn't immediately click with this novel and had to start over a few times. Going in, my expectation was really high, unfortunately, it wasn't instant love nor an epic read for me but I'm glad I stuck to it."
33,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant,Rating 2 out of 5,"This started well and within 50 pages was exactly what I was hoping it would be, an eye-opening unflinching look at something I’d never thought about before – foster care in Appalachia. I love big socially crusading novels! Turns out that in Virginia in the 90s foster care = child exploitation. Either you cash the DSS cheque and starve them (simple version) or you cash the DSS cheque, starve them and make them work eight hour shifts after school doing some crippling job no one else would do (sophisticated version). That part of the book was great. Then like a drug deal where they all end up dead it went bad real quick.To get to the second Big Issue that Demon Copperhead was going to deal with, which is the very famous American opioid addiction crisis, we follow our sparky poor white trash kid through his rescue from the horrible exploiters and his adoption by the local school football coach whose name is Coach and his month by month growing up into an aggravating smart-mouthed kid with all the usual preoccupations of girls, dope, drink and cartooning (and people who have zero interest in American football might want to know that there are many pages devoted to the subject), and it turns out that as soon as this poor kid stops being pounded on and tortured quite so much he becomes very tiresome very quickly. I had been told by reviewers in some big fat newspapers that this was a page turner and had a propulsive plot that never stopped. They lied. The plot keels over onto live support around page 150. But it wasn’t really the wheezing broke-down plot that was the problem. I jacked in this Pulitzer Prizewinning but not Booker Prize longlisted novel because I could not stand this kid’s voice. Every sentence is crammed with quippy slangy smartarseness. This kid is drenched in rueful self-awareness, wagging his head sorrowfully yet smirkily yet self-deprecatingly, and he never goes to a party or a funeral without describing everybody there & their relation to everybody else & what they were wearing and what they were drinking and what car they were driving or would want to have been driving. This kid thinks he’s wise and funny. He doesn’t seem to think he’s very annoying. And neither does Barbara Kingsolver. He is always saying stuff likeGood people, bad people, what does that even mean? Get down to the rock and the hard place, and we’re all just soft flesh and the weapon at hand.Voice is crucial to a book in the first person and it’s not easy to get right. Raymond Chandler does, DBC Pierre doesn’t, Irvine Welsh does, JD Salinger doesn’t, Charles Dickens does. My does might be your doesn’t. But if you are one of the many who think Barbara Kingsolver does get it right, then it’s your lucky day, because there’s 548 small-type pages of it. The reviewer deciding to give up Demon Copperhead"
34,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/97390147-a-mac,Rating 3 out of 5,"TW: Drug and Alcohol Abuse, Child Neglect, This work is a modern retelling of Dickens’ David Copperfield, though since it’s been so long since I’ve read the original, I can’t say exactly how heavily the original work is referenced in this read. I enjoyed that it utilizes and explores the same themes (generational poverty and trauma, class, etc.) but was set in Kentucky. I had mixed feelings about the portrayal of the people and struggles of the area, though. It felt like the author picked everything bad that could happen in the poorer areas of the Appalachians and forced them all into Demon’s life, leaving no room for any sort of positive portrayal. There’s a fine line between realism and sensationalism, and I think the author strayed too far the wrong way. Although this is generally what Dickens’ did with his works, that was two centuries ago and I’d hoped a modern retelling might be a little more well-rounded and a little less stereotypical. I think as long as folks don’t read this and assume that this is what life is like in the Appalachians, it will be okay. I enjoyed that this was a character-driven work that focuses on broader themes that affect the characters rather than a clearcut plot. I liked the characterization overall. As it’s told from Demon’s POV, we get to see his inner thoughts, his judgements (right or wrong), and how these changed as he grew up. I also think the author did a good job with the atmosphere and incorporating the setting. I did find at times that the work became repetitive or unnecessarily detailed, causing my interest to lag a bit. I did enjoy this read, and the author’s characterization throughout this work was wonderful. If you enjoy darker southern fiction, slower-paced reads, and coming of age stories, you’ll probably enjoy this one. "

To her mind, a ripped, bald guy in a denim vest and no shirt was the be-all end-all of manhood. If you’re surprised a mom would discuss boyfriend hotness with a kid still learning not to pick his nose, you’ve not seen the far end of lonely. Mom would light me a cigarette and we’d have our chats, menthols of course, this being in her mind the child-friendly option. I thought smoking with Mom and discussing various men’s stud factors was a sign of deep respect.”He's not even a teen, he’s only ten, but his mother was so young and alone when she had him, that she treats him like a companion, cigarettes and all. He’s not a bad kid. He’s a normal kid born into dreadful circumstances. His father died in an accident, and both sets of grandparents had disowned them, so his parents were left to their own devices. Mom is a recovering alcoholic, at least sometimes.This takes place in the western-most corner of Virginia, USA, in the coal country on the border of Kentucky and Tennessee. This is the middle of Appalachia, a long region that runs down from New York to the deep south, inland from the east coast. It is referred to disparagingly as hillbilly country. Damon is not happy about his name, a “boy band” name as he says, because it’s so easy to turn into Demon at school. He used his mother’s last name, Fields, but because of his red hair, he got Copperhead instead. Is there a name that it isn’t possible to twisted or bastardise in the name of so-called fun? I doubt it. Demon it is. His best friend is Maggot (Matthew), and surely that’s worse.It’s a very long, very drawn-out story of his bouncing painfully between foster homes that are really available to him only because they want his government welfare check and the free labour that a good-sized ten-year-old can provide. School? If it’s convenient, but if it’s tobacco harvesttime, forget it. Department inspections? Minimal if anything. The assigned officers mean well but are overwhelmed with cases, and a boy like Demon is hard to place.I’m afraid I am too familiar with the flaws and dangers in the child welfare system and with the deprivation and inequality of societies around the world. I don’t think Virginia and Appalachia is better or worse, but it’s awful, and Kingsolver includes everything she can think of to spread the message.I nearly gave up on this many times, but I decided to stick it out to see how she wound it up. I know there are readers who have loved this story. I’m not one of them. Something I did really enjoy was the author’s essay at the end, where she wrote about her inspiration while she and her husband were visiting England. She had booked a place in an inn.“Because this was Bleak House. Not in my mind, but in actual fact. This guest house had once been the seaside residence of Charles Dickens. I’d run across it online and booked us in on impulse, thinking it might be inspiring.. . . If I wished to spend my holiday weekend sitting at the desk where Charles Dickens wrote David Copperfield, I should feel free.. . . Once we’d settled in for the night, I took the blank notebook I’d carried for a month and excused myself to the little room down the hall that Dickens used to call his ‘airy nest’. I closed the door, rolled up my sleeves and rested my forearms, then my forehead, on the wooden desk. Trying to ignore the question I couldn’t stop hearing: ‘what next?’. . . I live in the southern Appalachian Mountains, a beautiful, rural place where we’re now watching a generation of kids grow up damaged or orphaned by prescription drug abuse. The story is much bigger than a bottle of pills: it’s about generational anguish, limited choices and suffocated hopes, poverty built into a region by historical design. That place is my home, I know its beauties and tragedies by heart, but this project daunted me.”She saw all the David Copperfield memorabilia on the walls, realising the David was actually Charles, who grew up in the poorhouse as a child labourer, a miserable childhood. She says it’s the artists job to make people hear things they don’t want to. She swears she heard Dickens speak to her.“‘Look to the child,’ he said. What I am telling you, believe it or don’t, is that I heard these words, spoken. Possibly in exasperation for my failure to grasp the basics: nobody doubts or blames the child. It’s the straightest shot to the heart.”She is exactly right. If this book speaks to you, it will go straight to your heart. I hope the essay is included in the published version. I’m quoting from a preview copy, because I think it’s important to stress that I believe Kingsolver’s motives are genuine and the story is real. She isn’t one of those writers jumping on a popular bandwagon to sell a book.I wish I’d had more of a connection with the characters and wanted to know what happened to them. I didn’t feel at all compelled to find out, I’m afraid. I suspect that’s my problem, not the author’s. Thanks to NetGalley and Faber and Faber for the copy for review."
36,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63328133-sheri,Rating 3 out of 5,"First, let me say that I despise long books. I generally bypass anything over about 350 pages as I believe you can and should tell a good story succinctly, and often lengthy stories tend to be filled with needless details or overly descriptive or otherwise ostentatious prose. But I am trying to challenge myself in new ways and I had read good reviews so I decided to give this a try. Now with that said, did I love this book? No, let's face facts, I was never going to love a 546 page/17 disc book. But I did like much of it. For some, it's an eye-opening look at poverty, drug addiction, foster care, and coming of age while living in the midst of all that. For others, who grew up in the same conditions or even on the fringes of such, it's not shocking, just par for the course. There were times, however, when I thought every possible misfortune and tragedy would come Demon's way. You hope for him to be resilient and come out the other side as a good person determined to do better and be better than all he's seen in his young life. But is there hope to be had? Is there enough to grab onto to keep him from falling over the edge?While I liked this, I think the length and the many burdens Demon faced caused some weariness in me that didn't allow me to fully appreciate the writing or the themes."

Demon Copperhead grabbed me by the lapels and kissed me into several tomorrows until I finished reading it. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! 5+++ stars!I listened to it on audiobook and the narration by Charlie Thurston is unbelievable! The main character is nicknamed Demon. His friends have memorable nicknames: Maggot, Fast Forward, Hammer, Mouse, and Angus. Demon describes his childhood as a ""four-star shitshow."" It consisted of poverty, drugs, abuse, death, and despair. Demon, his friends, and his family are dealt repeated blows in the boxing ring of life. These body blows bring them to their knees but they keep getting back up. Oxy (oxycontin) helps take the sting out of life. This year (2023), I have read three nonfiction books about the opioid crisis: Dopesick: Dealers, Doctors, and the Drug Company that Addicted America, Empire of Pain: The Secret History of the Sackler Dynasty, and Pain Killer: An Empire of Deceit and the Origin of America's Opioid Epidemic. Although it is fictional, Demon Copperhead places the reader right in the middle of the opioid shitshow and what daily life is like. Pill mills, selling and using, ""chasing the dragon,"" rehab, and death are all covered in an unvarnished way.What grabbed me and wouldn't let go during a 21 hour audiobook is Barbara Kingsolver's incredible character development, dialogue, and story arc. Demon's way of trying to find a positive angle despite all the horrible challenges he faced demonstrates this thin slice of hope that he carries with him. That glimmer of hope kept me on the edge of my seat. "
39,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5922426-bam-cooks-the-books--,Rating 5 out of 5,"**Winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Literature for 2023! Congratulations to Barbara Kingsolver!** 'Charles Dickens, seriously old guy, dead and a foreigner, but Christ Jesus did he get the picture on kids and orphans being screwed over and nobody giving a rat's ass. You'd think he was from around here,' says Demon Copperhead, hero of his own story. Demon was born to an 18-year-old junkie mother on the floor of a trailer home in rural Virginia. Things do not get much better for the boy from there on as he suffers through child abuse, the vagaries of foster care and child protective services and eventually fails victim to the opiod epidemic. Barbara Kingsolver has written a compelling adaptation of Dickens' beloved classic novel David Copperfield, setting it in her own time and place, the hills and hollers of Appalachia, and examining many of the same social ills that still plague our times. The characters she has created are so fully-developed and amazingly real, people this reader came to love, hate or maybe a touch of both. I tried to pick a favorite character, besides Demon himself of course, but soon realized there were just too many to choose from: Aunt June; Tommy; Mr Dick; Angus; Mr Armstrong; Ms Annie; Hammer Kelly. There are a few who try to be helpful but simply fall short, like Mrs Peggot; Miss Barks; Ms Betsey; Coach. Other kids who fall through the cracks of life like Dori; Emmy; Maggot. Plenty to hate too--like Stoner; Fast Forward; Creaky; the McCobbs; the hooker at the truck stop; U-Haul Pyles (think Uriah Heep); Dr Watts; Rose. At any rate, I will not soon forget these characters in the days to come. Every person has a story, don't they? Reading is one way to learn what it's like to be in someone else's shoes. I shouldn't fail to mention the interesting Appalachian history and beauty of the landscape that is woven into the story. Kingsolver looks at the differences between rural and city living and reminds us that derogatory words like 'hillbilly' are just as bad as other slurs--anything like that is used to belittle others. She explains the origin of 'rednecks' which began during a coal miners strike and the neckerchiefs they wore. I highly recommend this novel: it's a bit long but the story truly draws you in. I'm thinking it will make a great gift this holiday season for the book lovers on my list. It is definitely my favorite for the year 2022. I received an arc from the author and publisher via NetGalley. My review is voluntary and the opinions expressed are my own."

Kids name is Damon fields but goes by demon copperhead as boys in the area all have nicknames. He's tough, tall, smart, good looking, hard worker, and a talented self taught artist. A winner in most cases but he is to discouraged by his surroundings to realize he has a lot of advantages. This is also about the opioid epidemic. Which is a major epidemic of my generation. This is a good read for anybody interested in that or from the area. The rest of this review is personal so you can stop reading now if you like.I played football at a high level like demon. Had options for school but got married at 19. I grew up on the outskirts of the blue ridge/Appalachian mountains in Georgia the beginning of the Appalachian trail is close to where I grew up. My brother and I planned to to walk it at least the first quarter but I married at 19. Where about 236 miles from Lee County Virginia. closer than savannah to me, or demon is from the sea. I'm almost half native American Muskogee (creek) so and outsider like demon. In a area where everyone is related and has similar stories. Which is great for dating but how many Holcomb, Pruitt, and Padgett can you date. I married another outsider and am very happy. I have always been a little separate from the local custom. My family is very religious. My grandfather was a missionary and the first mission he got was west Virginia. Case in point we are neighbors of these people if not these people. I hear what demon is saying and understand the only difference is the opioid crisis. I've never been given opioids and or any other drug. My excuse was sports. but we all know how to get it. Its a slippery slope they say. I'm rambling so time to wrap this up.Demon has many advantages and would have succeeded anyway despite the drugs. Think of all the people who do not have the inner talents."

In Demon Copperhead, she tackled the opioid epidemic in Appalachia with a strong focus on the injustices and prejudged against the people and region. She takes a protective tone as she explores prejudice towards the area and the people through Demon's voice. At times it felt a bit like the war on Hillbillies as she tried to evoke empathy and compassion for an area and people who have been stereotyped as Hillbillies. While I felt sympathy and understanding, it didn't change any of the stereotypes. This is one long-winded story as Barbara Kingsolver puts Demon through the wringer, and Demon has no filters. He tells us everything he is thinking and doing, throwing off the story's pacing, and parts of the story dragged, and I wanted things to move faster. This should have been a memorable read for me, but it felt like so little happens, because Demon does too much talking. I can't remember the things that did happen.

44,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6700518-lorna,Rating 5 out of 5,"Demon Copperhead is the latest book by Barbara Kingsolver and as the author describes it, a tale set in the mold of Charles Dickens' David Copperfield, but this story is set in modern day Appalachia in the hills of Kentucky. Ms. Kingsolver told a group that on the final leg of her previous book tour, she and her husband were in England where they had booked a room in an inn that was the home of Charles Dickens. Because they were the only guests, they had free reign of the inn. Ms. Kingsolver tells how she sat in Dickens' study and at his desk. It was here that she knew what her next book would be. She says that in questioning how she would formulate her book, Charles Dickens imparted to her to write the story in the voice of the child, to let the child tell the story. And so we have the story of Demon Copperhead with his first words:
""First, I got myself born. A decent crowd was on hand to watch, and they've always given me that much: the worst part of the job was up to me, my mother being let's just say out of it.""
And so begins the story of the life of Demon Copperhead in Lee County with neighboring coal camps, livestock and tobacco farms. Born to a single mother in a trailer with no assets beyond his deceased father's good looks with the dark skin and light-green eyes of a Melungeon and his copper-red hair. This is the story of poverty, drug addiction, and a failed foster care system, but it also a story of survival against all odds. Here are a few of my favorite quotations in the voice of Demon Copperhead:
""The best place by far was the little branch that ran right behind our houses, as a place for a boy to turn invisible. Water with its own ideas, moving around under all of those rocks. And underneath the water, a kind of mud that makes you feel rich--leaf smelling, thick, of a color that you wanted to eat.""""I put my face to the window, so nobody would see, if I got tore up. Was this me now, for life? Taking up space where people wished I wasn't ? Once on a time I was something, and then I turned, like sour milk.""""She'd never seen a lightning bug. That is just tragic. I told her the different ones. One kind goes totally dark, then they all blink togethter, thousands, one big sparkly pop all up and down the creek. It can thrill a person senseless.""""Loser is a cliff. Once you've gone over, you're over.""
Barbara Kingsolver has a unique gift of storytelling that takes Dickens' body of work that told of institutional poverty and damage to children in his time and places it in her home of Appalachia telling of the plight of children in our turbulent times. She enlists the anger and compassion and empathy of Charles Dickens in setting forth a transformational story of Demon Copperhead and his group of lost boys. There is a delightful section of the book where Demon is reflecting on the classics that he has been reading, including The Catcher in the Rye.""
""Likewise the Charles Dickens one, seriously old guy, dead and a foreigner, but Christ Jesus did he get the picture on kids and orphans getting screwed over and nobody giving a rat's ass. You'd think he was from around here.""
And in the Acknowledgements, Barbara Kingsolver sums up the beauty of this book with this poignant dedication:
""For the kids who wake up hungry in those dark places every day, who've lost their families to poverty and pain pills, whose caseworkers keep losing their files, who feel invisible, or wish they were: this book is for you.""
ADDENDUM: May 2023. It has been announced that Demon Copperhead by Barbara Kingsolver has been awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. Well done, Ms. Kingsolver!"
45,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29654875-paula,Rating 1 out of 5,"I was looking forward to this one, having loved The Poisonwood Bible and several other of hers,even if I´m not that keen on the retelling/reimagining recent trend-no imagination anymore? (even if,arguably ,there are only so many storylines,but that´s a disgression).The voice of the main character is done well,and that´s about all I liked. The rest is a disrespectful and not well done rehash of David Copperfield (a fact everybody already knows) , down to the thinly disguised names. Dickens was a literary giant,showing,subtly telling. Here Kingsolver couldn´t lay it on thicker if she tried. The reader can´t ""process and elaborate"" as the best writers let us do,because everything is repeated-and repeated- and explained. The Oxy angle could have been better played,given that it´s the only contemporary thing,the rest being,as I said, a badly done Copperfied.Also, the constant whining...One good thing: reading this makes me appreciate Dickens alll the more.:)"
46,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29843800-bianca,Rating 5 out of 5,"Demon Copperhead was my first Kingsolver novel. I'm in awe, this was one hell of a novel. Demon Copperhead is the narrator of this novel. He didn't win the birth lottery, he was born to a teenage single mother, who was addicted to alcohol and drugs. They lived in a small community in the Southern Appalachians. She does the best she can, but she's not terribly capable. And then, Demon becomes an orphan. Here come disappointments, including terrible foster homes. Some good things happen to Demon as well. His life is a rollercoaster, with many nauseating highs and lows. Speaking of highs and lows, he gets the physical kind as well when he joins the plethora of painkiller addicts. While I had seen the news reports and read articles about the opioid crisis that destroyed so many people and communities, reading about it in this novel was more potent as it was portrayed through characters that I came to care about.I read other novels about dispossessed communities, more often than not, they come very close to joining a category of novels which I call misery/trauma porn. This incredible novel never even comes close to going into that (made-up) category, quite the feat as far as I'm concerned. The voicing was outstanding, it felt so realistic, even more, impressive was the fact that Kingsolver chose to write this through the voice of a male character.Another thing that I noticed and was impressed by was the lack of preaching, even though the novel had plenty to convey.So don't let this novel's size put you off, it's an easy read/listen, it's got a fast pace, and there's no sagging, lagging or padding - it's remarkable.A special mention goes to Charlie Thurston, who was terrific, he should get an award for his splendid reading."
47,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48483884-michael-finocchiaro,Rating 5 out of 5,"Update: This book did win Kingsolver her long-awaited Pulitzer (along with Hernan Diaz’s Trust) so, for the first time, I made a good guess :-)I truly hope that this book will give Kingsolver the Pulitzer that she deserved in 1999 for The Poisonwood Bible. Demon is a fabulously imperfect protagonist and his David Copperfield-type story is moving and utterly human. I mean, this could have been an incredibly boring book if it tried to follow Dicken's David Copper Field too much and without enough skill, but that didn't happen. It could have been a rubbernecker trainwreck of a novel with a voyeuristic view of addiction and teen sex and it avoided that too. Instead, it just gives us a uniquely vulnerable protagonist who we follow from becoming an orphan to losing it all to gaining it all back piece by piece and then losing it all again and hitting rock bottom. The Pilgrim's Progress of Demon works also to dispel some of the more common and negative stereotypes about ""mountain people"" by at least explaining the economic and pharmacological background in which they live. It is also a fantastic indictment of the oxy wars on the American poor of the late 90s and early 00s (and ongoing today). I loved Aunt June and was in love with both Emily and Agnes/Angus, heartbroken over Matthiew/Maggot, and disgusted with U-Haul, Fast Forward, and Stoner. I mean, jeez, the names of these characters were excellent.First, a quote about tobacco in rural Virginia (really all of the South):Around the time I topped and cut my first tobacco, we noticed the cigarette ads stopped playing. No idea why. If we'd known it was people thinking tobacco was dangerous for kids even to see on TV. with their eyes, we'd have found that dead hilarious. Our schools had smoking barrels. Teachers smoked on their breaks, kids at recess. The buyers were telling us the cancer thing was a scare, not proven. Another case of city people trash-talking us and our hard work, like anything else we did to feed ourselves: raising calves for slaughter, mining our coal, shooting Bambi with our hunting rifles. Now these people that would not know a tobacco plant if they saw one were calling it the devil.If Philip Morris and them knew the devil had real teeth, they sat harder on that secret than you'd believe. Grow it with pride and smoke it with pride, they said, giving out bumper stickers to that effect. I recall big stacks of them at school, free for the taking. Grow and smoke we did, while the price per pound went to hell, and a carton got such taxes on it, we were smoking away our grocery money. We drove around with ""Proud Tobacco Farmer"" stickers on our trucks till they peeled and faded along with our good health and dreams of greatness. If you're standing on a small pile of shit, fighting for your one place to stand, God almighty how you fight. (p. 104)Next quote is this beautiful passage about Demon and the wheelchair-confined genius, Mr. Dick:""I didn't ask how he usually did it, who helped him or what, because I had my own plan. He wheeled outside, down the porch ramp and its the flagstones of the front sidewalk, this being all the farther his wheelchair could go. But still in the yard. No running room. He motioned me to take the kite and go on with it, but I said, My man! We can do better. I wheeled him off the sidewalk onto the grass, which wasn't hard with him weighing probably not much more than a bale of hay. Out over the bumpy grass we went, Mr. Dick working his mouth until what came out was ""Heee, heeee!"" Which I took to mean Hell yes!I unlatched the back gate and wheeled him plumb out into the stubble of the hayfield behind the house. Then the going got pretty rough, wheelchairwise, so we didn't go far, just to where I could get the runny-go I needed to send that sucker to the moon. The clouds were scooting by, throwing shadows like a herd of wild monsters rumpusing over the field, and I was right there with them. I hefted the kite and let out the string, more and more till it was not but a speck in the sky. I could feel rain starting to spit on us, and who cared. Let it thunder.The string was pulling hard in the wind, but I towed it back to Mr. Dick and put it in his hand. ""Hang on tight."" I said, and plopped on the ground beside him, panting like a dog. He was quiet, holding that string and kite with everything he had. The way he looked. Eyes raised lip, body tethered by one long thread to the big stormy sky, the whole of him up there with his words, talking to whoever was listening. I've not seen a sight to match it. No bones of his had ever been shoved in a feed bag. The man was a giant. (p. 210)Here is a nice passage about finally deciding to give up the monkey on your back:I needed to wish her happiness. Fly away and don't fall back into the slime I'm trying to crawl out of here, and also drinking on the sly, calling it my life's blood. Too scared to leave the last place where people looked at me and saw their son or blood brother or their shot at a winning season. I knew what she'd say about that. Trust the road. Because nobody stays, in the long run you're on your own with your ghosts. You're the ship, they're the bottle. I spent the night curled up on the sandy floor with my back pressed against cold rock, thirsty and hungry and in the end not sufficiently doped. Every cricket that inched along the cave face was a copperhead, every squirrel rustling dry leaves was a bear. If I lived till morning, I would walk down the mountain, find June, and tell her I was ready to fly. (p. 502)And finally, I liked this passage about Demon finding his groove:I'm not saying there was a market for any of this. But the days of the big village were just starting. If there's a shoe out there for every foot, the lonely and oddball foot by means of the internet had a vastly improved chance of finding it. My weird cartoons got a little following that grew, and after a year I sold subscriptions. Not very many. Luckily, I wasn't in it for the money. One thing I learned from Mr. Armstrong while striving heartily to remain uneducated: a good story doesn't just copy life, it pushes back on it. It's why guys like Chartrain wear their clothes too big and their teeth edged with gold, why Mr. Dick puts words on kites and sends them to the sun. It's why I draw what I draw.My favorite moment in Dicken's classic was the epic storm, and the one proposed here by Kingsolver at the climax is worthy of its model. Great writing with both dramatic effect but also restraint from overdoing it. Majestic.Overall, Demon is not as epic or historically rooted a drama as Poisonwood was, but all her mastery of language and accents, the way she gets into the heads of her characters, and her mastery of the narrative make this an enriching reading experience.Best of luck from this reader, I hope she gets a long-awaited Pulitzer for this wonderful book."
48,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3268839-theresa-alan,Rating 5 out of 5,"Damon is born in a double-wide trailer to a too-young mom who battles substance abuse. The father died before he was born. Demon is the nickname he takes on along with the last name Copperhead—snakes that allegedly roamed around the area in the southern mountains of Appalachia where they live. When his mother dies, he survives a string a foster care places where he’s literally treated like a dog. He’s always hungry, in part because he’s a growing boy but also the foster families put him to work difficult and sometimes dangerous jobs as a way to earn his keep, while they pocket the money the state gives them on anything other than giving him an adequate diet. There are long scenes that just simply heartbreaking, because if you’ve ever read anything about foster care and the way the Sackler family through the pharmaceutical firm Purdue destroyed the lives not just of people who got addicted but their families as well, you’ll be furious. This might technically be fiction, but it’s also an insight into the troubling way doctors sold their souls for trips to Hawaii even after the addiction aspects of the drugs became clear.Damon finally finds the mother of his dead father. Through her, she sets him up in a house of a coach who, during the season his whole life is football, and out of season, he quiets his mind by consuming excessive amounts of alcohol. Because Damon is tall for his age, Coach Winfield fast tracks him on to the team. Now, Damon is treated like something of a star instead of the slurs he’s faced his whole life. Until he gets an injury and is prescribed Oxy. Now beer and weed won’t cut it, and he spends a great deal of time procuring drugs and prescriptions and selling drugs to be able to afford drugs and also groceries. The woman he loves really goes off the deep end drug-wise after her father dies. Now she has no purpose. Damon’s purpose is to keep her alive, which is getting harder to do.The characters in this are complex. They have magnetic appeal but treat people terribly. You hope the kids that finally get some help can stay healthy.There is political commentary about how city people treat people who live not just off jobs at Walmart but through hunting, fishing, sewing their own clothes, and raising crops. One of the few bright spots in Damon’s brief high school years is that he’s a gifted artist who meets an art teacher who can help him bring his art to a higher level. This is a largely depressing book because even though it’s fiction, it does cover real-life lives destroyed by drugs that are prescribed by doctors but are so addictive, anything else in life but getting blotto pales in comparison."
49,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68708752-beverly,Rating 4 out of 5,"Demon Copperhead won the Pulitzer Prize, along with another book, this year. I found it light and frothy and glib, while at the same time being very sincere in the view of Appalachia that Kingsolver is tryng to convey. The story is written as a modern David Copperfield and I really enjoyed tracing the characters and events of that classic (which is my favorite book by Charles Dickens), and finding its counterparts in this book.Damon Fields, also known as Demon, is the voice and narrator and while I got a feel for who he is, I never identified with him as I did with young, naive David. Even as a child, Demon seemed to be a tiny adult, probably because of how fast you have to grow up in West Virginia, but it's not endearing.I also always hated the part in David Copperfield that had to do with Emily's disgrace and banishment. I even dread coming to that part in the book. I never felt too caught up in the similar story in Demon Copperhead, because it is not a major part of the story, more of an aside and I never got a clear picture of her either.Dickens's story is partially autobiographical and that makes it more powerful. He was writing about his experience with a deadbeat father and a loss of hope and his future. Kingsolver's story is more of a treatise on why the south is the way it is and why the oxycodone epidemic hit it so hard. Both are great reasons for writing, but I find the personal, more intriguing than the political."
50,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17557841-lori-keeton,Rating 5 out of 5,"A small-town Applachian kid born to a junkie, Demon Copperhead has all the signs of going nowhere fast. Life starts cruel and doesn’t get much better as he grows up in poverty, with a single mom who marries a real doozy of a guy who gets his kicks by abusing and terrorizing his new family. Demon is a likable youngster who has a love of drawing superheroes and when he becomes orphaned, he gets caught up in the broken foster care system bouncing around from place to place and home to home living with people who don’t want him. Can you even imagine? Going through life having so little faith in the people, adults, who should be there for him, life as a constant let down. His love for and belief in superheroes just goes to show that he is crying out for someone to help him, believe in him, love him. But when life takes a turn for the positive for Demon and then is swiftly taken away, Demon’s life is seemingly changed forever.Me, though. I was a born sucker for the superhero rescue. Did that line of work even exist, in our trailer-home universe? Had they all quit Smallville and gone looking for bigger action? Save or be saved, these are questions. You want to think it’s not over till the last page.Barbara Kingsolver set out to write a story for the survivors to demonstrate their resiliency to overcome a lot of life’s garbage. Her story is one that reflects the social injustices that plague her native Appalachia and pokes a finger at those institutions that have disappointed and let down the people living in these communities. She takes aim at these institutions as well as shedding a very harsh light on the opioid epidemic that has plagued and continues to plague these rural areas of Kentucky, Virginia, and Tennessee. She embraces how the people here are so often misrepresented and misunderstood, gives the people a voice and shines a light on heartbreaking circumstances.But Kingsolver also determined to retell one of the most iconic and well-known of Charles Dicken’s novels, David Copperfield. I believe that she has done it well with her own style and with her characters that represent Appalachia. Dickens was a huge proponent of championing the social issues of his day especially when it came to poverty and orphans. Readers familiar with Dickens and David’s story will recognize characters and storylines. This is NOT an easy novel to read. It wrenches at your gut and stomps on your soul. It is bleak and difficult to get through. The language is raw and rough. But Kingsolver’s prose is pointed and piercing and gets to the heart of her mission. I highly recommend reading this book even if you have absolutely no connection to Appalachia. You won’t be surprised to find themes prevalent all over the United States."
51,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2228181-jill,Rating 5 out of 5,"“A good story doesn’t just copy life, it pushes back on it.”This line appears relatively late in this masterpiece by Barbara Kingsolver, but it summarizes what this gifted author achieves throughout this novel – pushing back on a life where 10-year-old orphaned boys are lost in the revolting morass of foster care where nobody gives a damn and where they have lost life’s lottery from the moment they are born.Add in no decent schooling, no chance to get good at anything, no caring or responsible adults to oversee what will happen to them, and an out-of-control oxytocin crisis that enfolds the few who can fight back, and it’s a powerful indictment about where our country is falling down. The novel would be heartbreaking if it were not for the resiliency of Demon Copperfield, who emerges with a heart that overflows with goodness and a powerful survivor’s instinct.Barbara Kingsolver states that she was inspired by Charles Dicken’s David Copperfield and his impassioned critique of institutional poverty. Indeed, English literature majors like me will see the parallels between Dickens’ work and this one – the young boy whose father died before he was born, the violent stepfather, the helpful Peggots (in Dickens, the nurse was named Peggotty), the idolization of a boy who doesn’t deserve it, and of course Agnes (renamed Angus). But here, the setting is not urban London but the misunderstood and often caricaturized Appalachia. If any children need a superhero to recover their dignity and self-respect, it is those children, who are spurned by foster care and child protective services and victimized by oxytocin and meth addiction and actively supplied with the tools to cook out their brains. Indeed, this is a Victorian saga transposed to our modern-day times, and the sad thing is, too much of the way we discard and dismiss children hasn’t changed. For shame.Like David Copperfield, Demon must wrestle with his own invisibility in a rural backcountry where superheroes do not exist unless you strive to become one yourself. The novel asks: can we change our trajectory in life with the odds so much against us? Can we – to paraphrase T.S. Eliot – go back to the place it all began and know the place for the first time? What gives our lives hope and meaning? This book is just phenomenal, and I can’t thank HarperCollins enough for granting my request to be an early reader in exchange for an honest review. Six stars!"
52,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,Rating 3 out of 5,"Alas, my prediction of an Appalachian Shuggie Bain was pretty much on the nose. I hoped for more when I heard that one of my favourite contemporary novelists was writing an update of my favourite book of all time, the story of an orphan who overcomes cruelty and poverty to find love and embark on a creative career. Ultimately, I had to wonder what the point of this was; why we needed it when we’ve had so many other portraits, nonfiction or otherwise, of the opioid crisis. I concluded to myself that Kingsolver wrote it simply because she could, and because she is committed to social justice. Luckily, Demon’s sassy voice saves the book from getting too depressing. The strategy struck me as being similar to Jane Smiley’s A Thousand Acres, which transplants the story of King Lear to contemporary Iowa. And I thought it was awfully cute how the protagonist’s dearest wish is to see the ocean."

I came out, Mom went in, and gave it a hundred percent. Gave and gave again over the years, getting to be an expert at rehab, like they say. Having done it so many times.”.Barbara Kingsolver set out to write a book which would showcase both her love and her sadness for her beloved Appalachia. She did this brilliantly with the creation of the fabulous and memorable protagonist Demon Copperhead. I love first person narrators and Demon is one of the very best. His voice makes this novel. With his sardonic wit Demon narrates the story of his life from birth to adulthood. Along the way I fell in love with him, his language and his humor which helps him survive the hardest of times. His Appalachian wit sparkles on every page. It made me smile and sometimes laugh my way through this book despite the poverty, addiction, etc.. Perhaps Barbara Kingsolver's best book to date. The audio narration by Charlie Thurston is exceptional."

This one was just so depressing, awful and horrible to our poor hero Damon. At 30% I just could not take the awfulness he continues to endure due to his being poor, an orphan and treated so poorly by the entire Appalachian community, as they have little to offer or provide for him, other than opiods.I know this has been loved and given a 4.57 rating across GR readers, but I cannot take any more. I finally bought it after two attempts at library ebooks, but I was just too dragged down personally to continue. Good on the rest of you for persevering and enjoying this one. I cannot. DNF at 33%."

Once, I got to Reading this Incredible Book, I was Hooked Right Away. I finished the book in 4 days. Demon Copperhead captured my heart ❤️ right away. I routed for him the whole time. This is a character where you can see his huge potential, yet Demon has had a hard life, as his Dad has died at the start of the book. His Mom is addicted to several drugs and is in and out of Rehab. Demon ends up in Foster Care and is at the mercy of whoever takes him in. That he has such a will to survive and tolerates more than any child should is much to his credit and outlook on life. So, I wanted Demon to Thrive, just not Survive another day, but I do not think think that would be a word he would use. It seemed so beyond him, as he identifies himself as a “Foster” and you come to understand all that entails. So, this story is told through Demon’s eyes as a child growing into a young man. I love the language and passages Barbara Kingsolver uses to explain life and how people in Rural Appalachia are not Ignorant Trash. He describes how a kid who is kind of not fitting in, overweight, and the kids see him as a loser. He says most would not say that to his face. One day, in the bathroom a group of friends are talking about him in a derogatory way. Well, the kid then opens the bathroom door and has heard all their mean comments. Demon parallels this to the way people speak of people in Lee County, Virginia. Trailer Trash, Good for Nothing, and Make Many Jokes about Them. He says it’s the same, they are behind that door and know what enlightened people say. They already know, so basically stop pretending already. This is why they don’t trust outsiders, not because they are so stupid. So, institutional poverty sadly has not changed that much. With it brings hungry bellies for children, abuse of all sorts, foster care that may be ok or absolutely horrendous, neglect, feeling invisible, and children who can not envision a future for themselves. It was sad and depressing at times. The Opioid Crisis is a big part of this book. It should be as it was happening when the book was set. I had a particularly hard time with reading some of this as it is so graphic and have read several books recently on Pill Addiction and Heroin Addiction. I do think it read as authentic, just so hard at points to read about teenagers dying and never having a chance. Definitely, do consider this if you or someone you know has an Opioid Addiction. It could be very triggering. I was so emotionally invested in Demon, I wanted him to be saved. I wanted life to go his way. I wanted a bright future for him. He deserved that, just a chance at life. He is a talented artist and his Art Teacher, Ms. Annie sees this. She knows the odds may not be in Demon’s favor, but she always refuses to give up on him. So, does June, another Fierce woman I loved. She is a nurse and knows exactly how these kids have been targeted with over prescribing medication. She really cares and I loved her for it. There were many characters in the book, many I just loved their nicknames including Demon Cooperhead, Maggot, Swap-Out, Fast Forward, U-Haul, Stoner, and Gizmo. Each had a story behind their nickname. This added to the atmosphere of the Appalachians. I felt a part of their world. There is such beauty in the Appalachian Mountains, but the Underbelly often is Devastating. Children deserve better. They always have, but often are forgotten. This is hard book to read at times, but a beautiful one as well. I loved it. Thank you Barbara Kingsolver for exposing many prejudices I have carried and need to rethink how I view others. Children, certainly, but all people as we need better support systems and less apathy for all. Definitely, Highly Recommend this Book."
57,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62734043-raychel,Rating 1 out of 5,"I’m gonna bow out of this one. The fetishization of Appalachia and the unrelenting White Savior complex of Barbara Kingsolver is exhausting. I was hoping the White Savior-ness would’ve been toned down since The Poisonwood Bible but nope. Just a different population to exploit. I don’t need a novel to make me empathize with people. And I certainly don’t need Barbara fucking Kingsolver to “give voice and visibility to a place and its people where beauty and desperation live side by side.” There are ways to talk about all of the topics in this book with tact but that does not happen here. You can talk about substance abuse, poverty, domestic violence, assault, the foster care system, and ineffective social services without turning an already misrepresented population into sideshow freaks. Save your energy and read something that isn’t trauma porn for all the nice, white, solidly middle class people of the world to get off to. "
58,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2843912-switterbug-betsey,Rating 5 out of 5,"Dickens was a bustling, garrulously sardonic storyteller. A fan I was not of his particular writing style (he was paid by the word and you could tell!), but the expansive content of his stories contained pointed themes of wealthy v. poor, privilege, addiction, abandonment, and a lot to deploy on the foster care system. Kingsolver never writes the same novel twice—each is its own wildly different story. She’s a chameleon writer who demonstrates that fact once again with her inspired-by-Dickens but contemporized, Americanized version. Kingsolver’s talent all over it. Remarkable! This is Pulitzer material, even if Kingsolver is openly auditioning. It’s deserved. Nobody has cracked open the American foster care struggles like Kingsolver! It makes you think. It makes you want to serve.A picaresque and boisterous novel, Demon Copperhead is title and narrator, taking place from perhaps late 90s up to the single numbers of the aughts. It’s an odyssey of never-ending adventures, a Fool’s errand, a red-headed, green-eyed Melungeon in rural, natural world Lee County, Virginia, where cliched terms are on point—hillbillies (and some edification on it), meth heads, drop-outs, etc. But Kingsolver gave dimension to the often stereotyped, brought the lens up close, granular edition. Demon I fell in love with at first sight, he’s endearing. Other characters crept inside of my heart, like his friend Emmy and her mother, June, who came early in his life, Mrs. Peggot and Maggot, as well as Angus (Agnes), the football Coach’s daughter and his foster-sister and brother type relationship with her. And Tommy, one of his healthier relationships with another foster kid. Dori his bittersweet romance. Dark characters, too, like Rose Dartell. Demon was tall for his age, ends up 6’4” in his later teens. Able with art, drawing crowd-pleasing comics with exciting superheroes.What makes a family? As fucked up as these kids and adults are to each other, it gives them a reason to live another day. Some of these dysfunctional bonds go beyond judgment into a place where these underacknowledged and kicked-to-the-curb kids find fragile status. Drugs, poverty, and abandonment contribute to the awful messes they keep getting in, but occasionally a person with compassion enters their lives and gives them encouragement. The kids are street-wise and heart-broken too many times to count. Demon and his crew know hunger on a prolonged timetable. They’ve been discounted and condescended to, and failure is always a tragic option. And when a character in Kingsolver’s novel is dopesick, I felt it in my bones. Corpuscles. Demon shows the reader a wide range of emotions. “Here’s where Miss Barks” (his caseworker) ""didn’t grow up: foster care. She had no clue how people can be living right on the edge of what’s doable. If you push too hard, you can barrel yourself over a damn cliff.” It is a masterpiece work, once again, from Barbara Kingsolver. Thank you so much to Harper Collins for sending me an early copy for review."

And boy, what a drama! So much sadnesses! Based on Dickens' David Copperfield, Demon Copperhead is set in the mountains of southern Appalachia.The writing is superb and the development of the storyline is well done, although slow.There are lots of heartbreaking or sad moments, but Demon’s spirit is awesome, especially after dealing with so much drama.If you are not tired of reading about addictions, especially the opioid crisis, then you are in for a treat.But be warned that this is not an action book.I do think that the book could have been reduced by 100 pages. I felt more engaged during the first 40%. If you loved Shuggie Bain, by Douglas Stuart, you will likely love this one.I just wished that I was emotionally connected with Copperhead.Perhaps I read it too fast or perhaps it was too depressing.I read the book while listening to the audiobook (about 21 hours, if played at normal speed) narrated by Charlie Thurston, who did a great job, although sometimes I had to increase the speed."
