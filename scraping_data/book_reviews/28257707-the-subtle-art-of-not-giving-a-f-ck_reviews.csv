Duh. And, 2) Because it's bright fucking orange. That said, the chum was in the water for me already based on that alone. But when I got to this:I knew this book and I would be friends. I am SO anti-participation trophy it's ridiculous. And, no, I don't care if that offends all the middle class helicopter moms and their special snowflakes. Your kid needs to learn how to lose.That's how character is built, my friends.And that's pretty much one of the major points in this book actually.That and, simply put, prioritizing where you put your emotional energy aka your fucks. Stuff I have a solid a handle on already. But, full transparency, I read this out of curiosity and with a slim to none expectation of there being anything life changing to take away from it.Don't get me wrong, color me surprised, I thought this book made a lot of solid points.Some really good, well articulated ones actually. I definitely do think this book has something to offer.For example, it reminded me that I need to stop hoping my sister and I form a BFF Sweet Valley High-esque sister friendship and accept the fact that we are 35+ fucking years old and it's just not gonna happen.And that's okay. She only texts me when she wants or needs something and, while we love and respect each other - we just aren't all THAT. And that's okay. As I said, it made good points - none of which the author attempted to claim creating - he just wrote it down in an easy, witty, sometimes offensive and conversational fashion with examples of his own life and personal epiphanies. It did get a little ridiculous sometimes with how much he referred to his former ""bangs all the ladies"" behavior. We get it, you are a walking dream machine. *eye roll*It also contradicted itself a bit in some areas, though nothing detrimental in my eyes. He also definitely walked a fine line when discussing certain issues as they pertain to women.Feminists and just some women in general will NOT appreciate this book. Not gonna lie though, right or wrong, this book definitely appealed to my snarky, crass kind of humor, reminding me once again that I apparently have the personality and sense of humor of a dude. But whatevers.That's not a fuck I care to give, apparently."
1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21493936-clumsy-storyteller,Rating 5 out of 5,"Masterpiece, incredibly funny. i don't usally go for self help books cause to me they are all the same! Smile more, love more, hate less, don't give up, it's gonna be okay, it's all in your head. Blah blah blah.... but this one was the exception. Anything with curse words on the cover picks my interest :P The first half of it was my favorite, the aim of this book is to help the reader to think a little bit more clearly about what they’re choosing to find important in life and what they’re choosing to find unimportant.These are few of my favrite quotes in this book:The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience.Self-improvement and success often occur together. But that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re the same thing.Our culture today is obsessively focused on unrealistically positive expectations: Be happier. Be healthier. Be the best, better than the rest. Be smarter, faster, richer, sexier, more popular, more productive, more envied, and more admired. Be perfect and amazing and crap out twelve-karat-gold nuggets before breakfast each morning while kissing your selfie-ready spouse and two and a half kids goodbye. Then fly your helicopter to your wonderfully fulfilling job, where you spend your days doing incredibly meaningful work that’s likely to save the planet one day. Ironically, this fixation on the positive—on what’s better, what’s superior—only serves to remind us over and over again of what we are not, of what we lack, of what we should have been but failed to be. After all, no truly happy person feels the need to stand in front of a mirror and recite that she’s happy. She just is.Everyone and their TV commercial wants you to believe that the key to a good life is a nicer job, or a more rugged car, or a prettier girlfriend, or a hot tub with an inflatable pool for the kids. The world is constantly telling you that the path to a better life is more, more, more—buy more, own more, make more, fuck more, be more. You are constantly bombarded with messages to give a fuck about everything, all the time. Give a fuck about a new TV. Give a fuck about having a better vacation than your coworkers. Give a fuck about buying that new lawn ornament. Give a fuck about having the right kind of selfie stick.The Feedback Loop from HellThere’s an insidious quirk to your brain that, if you let it, can drive you absolutely batty. Tell me if this sounds familiar to you: You get anxious about confronting somebody in your life. That anxiety cripples you and you start wondering why you’re so anxious. Now you’re becoming anxious about being anxious. Oh no! Doubly anxious! Now you’re anxious about your anxiety, which is causing more anxiety. Quick, where’s the whiskey?"

Well for starters,  Mark Manson is a real douche. There has never been a better husband than  Mark Manson. Why? He doesn't put up with bullshit. If his wife looks like shit he tells her. He won't tolerate her looking bad no matter how much time she has spent getting ready to go out. And we must take note of how edgy Manson is. He actually figured out you can remove the word care and replace it with fuck. WOW! How profound! What he really means in the quote above is caring too much is bad for you. Oh, let's not forget how he loves to give added emphasis to things. When talking about music, it's not enough to reference The Beatles, they are the The GODDAMN Beatles. What Manson has done here is dust off some older self-help philosophies, replace as many words as possible with FUCK and tried to make it look shiny, new and innovative. It's not. Manson proudly announces he cuts through the crap! But alas, he does not. What Manson really does is steal some ideas from Buddhism and works hard to make himself look like a wise philosopher, and old soul. There are only so many things we can care about so we need to figure out which ones really matter ~~ sorry ~~ There are only so many things we can give a fuck about so we need to figure out which ones really matter. Or how about this gem: ""While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience."" Wow! While Manson pats himself on the back for this gem, I can't help but think of Emerson, “Its the not the Destination, It's the journey.” Thankfully, Manson brilliantly improves on Emerson and makes himself so much more profound in this generation-defining self-help guide. Most of Manson's observations make me roll my eyes, or at times, laugh out loud. How did we survive as a society without  Mark Manson?Manson has a new book coming out in May. Maybe I'll read it, but probably not, because honestly, I just don't give a fuck ..."
3,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28323108-jo-the-book-geek,Rating 1 out of 5,"Has anybody been unfortunate enough to be sitting in a pub/restaurant, enjoying the ambience and possibly a meal, and out of nowhere, a rather drunk individual parks himself beside you, grinning profusely, and then just doesn't stop talking about his life, your life and everything HE thinks that you should be doing, but without any solid proof to back himself up? I have, and this book by Mark Manson made me feel like I was back in that pub, but with an even dodgier individual attempting to give me life lessons. Seeing this book for the first time, I'll admit, I was pretty revved up about reading it. I mean, lets be honest, a bright orange cover with ""The subtle art of not giving a f*ck"" boldly plastered on it, you can hardly miss it. The book began with an introduction, which made me feel like this was was going to be a truly life changing read. But, from the words ""Chapter one"" it all took a swift nose dive. Manson began the first few chapters with a lot of ""Fuck this, fuck that, fuck you"" kind of attitude. I can take cursing, but this, this was kind of tiring. It was like listening to a young person that has just discovered the art of cursing. It sucked and it was unnecessary.There were some interesting points, but you need to dig deep to find them. I found that this book contained mostly opinions, with a few hidden facts chucked in for good measure. I cannot understand how Romeo and Juliet could be brought into this book, then a couple of pages later, Buddhism, and then many fucks later, he is telling us that HE is amazing, as he has the audacity to inform his wife when she looks shitty, and, best of all, apparently she loves that. I just don't buy it.For me, this book is just a preachy retelling of things we already know, written by an average male and, I'm still trying to understand what possessed me to spend actual money on this! Absolutely no fucks given."
4,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57797254-cindy,Rating 3 out of 5,"There are a lot of points in the first half of the book that I agree with: prioritizing fewer things and the right things; defining the right values and what you are willing to struggle for; being addicted to outrage and victimhood to avoid responsibility and acknowledging mistakes; etc. However, the tone is VERY heavy on this edgy dudebro persona that gets tiring easily, especially in the beginning where the author drops the F bomb every other sentence in order to seem “real” and contrarian. The book would probably be most appealing to straight white men, since there are some parts of advice that would not resonate well with other groups - for example, he talks about the entitlement of victimhood and how that prevents positive change, which is true to a certain extent if we were to look at specific places like twitter, but should not be boasted as blanket statements coming from a white man who admits to coming from a wealthy family. The second half of the book is the weakest, as it starts to dwindle with advice on love and relationships and some of the author’s hokey philosophy on life and death - these parts were too trite for my tastes and felt like he was trying to halfheartedly wrap up the book in a meaningful way now that we were getting to the end. Ultimately, I am settling on 3 stars because there are still some values that I agree with and will take away from this book (and hope other people will too), but not for some of the others, and certainly not with the author’s writing voice."
5,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1037413-libbyscreen,Rating 1 out of 5,"I'm not actually done yet, but this book is becoming more problematic by the page. In re: false memories and page 128: False memories are absolutely a thing. But when the example you use to illustrate this fact is a 1980's feminist who falsely accused her father of abuse and you follow up with ""in the early 1980s and 1990s hundreds of innocent people were wrongly accused of sexual violence under similar circumstances. Many of them went to prison for it"" you are being supremely irresponsible. The casual reader who is not familiar with sexual violence and rape and abuse could easily walk away with the impression that survivors of sexual assault often make up their assault. This is utterly, utterly untrue - we know that rape and incest are some of the most under reported and under prosecuted crimes, and that the possibility of not being believed plays a big role in that.***Finally finished. One star. You don't need to read this book. "
6,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15987292-mary-monaghan,Rating 2 out of 5,"I started out liking this book, I really did. By the time I was halfway in, his smug attitude about things he frankly knows jack shit about were getting on my nerves. He made some excellent points, all of which have been made countless times by other, more competent writers. Read Sartre, Camus, Siddhartha by Herman Hesse, and various Buddhist texts instead. Regurgitating Eastern philosophy and existentialism while swearing a lot only gets you so far. I stopped reading and returned this book."

It has some good things to say, and it's a decent introduction to some great concepts, but it's pretty cringe and misogynistic.I would suggest Why Buddhism is True and The Practicing Stoic instead as much better books to read that cover the same ground more in depth, without any of the negatives."

12,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/101693182-tharindu-dissanayake,Rating 2 out of 5,"""This is something called maturity. It's nice; you should try it sometimes.""There weren't any 1 or 2-star rated books on my GR shelves until now. If I find a book is not working out the way I had hoped, I stay away from it, and will not invest any more time. This is the first book to contradict this practice. Based on the hype, I was looking forward to enjoying this book for a very long time. When I finally started, I quickly got the impression that this is not for me. But even with getting do-not-continue warning signs right from the start, I proceeded till the end, hoping something will change my opinion. Well, if I had received any help from this book, that would be with 'not giving a f*ck' about this book, and move on. I even feel like I'm being generous giving 2-stars instead of one, but that's only for the interesting example stories author presented (only the stories, not the author's opinions) and for the obvious difficulties of life that we all already know.""Rejections that were painful in the moment have actually worked out for the best.""""If you're able to not give a f*ck about the pain, you become unstoppable.""Starting from the first chapter, I had the vague feeling that I had dived into a Gladwell 'self-help' book. The obvious (and simple) truths about life and circumstances are presented in a very amusing manner, sandwiched between what I felt to be inexperienced conjecture of the author. True, there were a few good parts, and I would even categorized them as helpful, but it felt those truths had been taken out of context to suit to the author's own views. Initially, I had the impression, may be the book is moving along the lines of the art of letting go, but that also stopped very quickly. According to the author, there's a line separating what's worth or not giving attention to, and our principles are only valid based on which side of the line we're at. Even the almost annoying number of 'f*cks' diminished after a few chapters, to proceed along what felt like a very long rant.""Maturity is what happens when one learns to only give a f*ck about what's truly f*ckworthy.""""Self-improvement and success often occur together. But that doesn't necessarily mean they're the same things.""I'm a Buddhist, and would like to consider myself at least somewhat familiar with Buddhism. As the enlightenment is accepted to be related to letting go of the worldly pleasures according to Buddhism, Manson takes this as an example to justify his opinions. Then, he goes and creates a line, which he thinks is from where the letting-go should be applied to. It's not that the content are false, but everything's completely taken out of the original context, and I'm failing to see how any of this is supposed to be 'helpful'. One could certainly empathize with everything stated here, and agree to most of it, but that's pretty much it: I couldn't find the self-help part (if there was any). If the book's intention was to make one immune (or resistant) to the difficulties the society put in one's way (as the name implies), at least for me, it failed spectacularly. After the first few chapters, it often felt like the author contradicting himself with what followed. ""Happiness is not a solvable equation. Dissatisfaction and unease are inherent parts of human nature.""""The greatest truths in life are usually the most unpleasant to hear.""Just like with a Gladwell book, I think one should read this book carefully, especially if the reader is new to self-help/ philosophy genres. If you're already familiar with some good/ logical philosophy books, chances are, you'll take everything in this with a grain of salt, and only extract what's helpful. However, when a non-fiction book gets this much popularity, this could even become the very first self-help book one reads. And that's a dangerous thing, to start along with a system that accepts 'expecting the negative to happen to be a positive thing'. As the experiences/ examples presented are clear, and very easy to relate to, it's easy to get completely lost in a philosophy like this. I still decided to share some (obvious) wisdom quotes, but I hope you won't be tempted to read this one because of them. On the contrary, I'm only reviewing this one to warn any future readers, especially if you're new to self-help or non-fiction books.""People who base their self-worth on being right about everything prevent themselves from their mistakes."""
13,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32799998-erin,Rating 1 out of 5,"I don't read self-help. I simply don't believe in the self-help genre. If you need a book to help you live your life you have bigger problems than whatever brought you to that book. That may seem harsh but its just my opinion and you are free to ignore it.Since I don't read self-help, you may be asking ""Erin, Why did you read this book? Blame Popsugar. I'm doing the Popsugar 2017 Reading challenge and needed to read a book from a genre I don't usually read. As you can see if you look at my book shelf I pretty much read every genre. So I narrowed it down to 3 genres: Self-help, Christian, or Amish Romance. I picked Self-help. Mark Manson is proof that anyone can get a book deal. I understand that he has a very popular blog and publishing is about money but God this book is bad. I found myself speed reading it just so it would end. Mark Manson is shallow, smug, and completely uninformed about everything that he was trying to talk about. You know what I don't give a fuck about? This book. DON'T READ IT. AVOID AT ALL COST!

14,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2986658-jen,Rating 2 out of 5,"Based on the title, I was pretty stoked for this, and the introductory essay explaining the author's Not Giving a F*ck theory made a lot of sense to me and made me really happy. Essentially, he says that the internet and the media demand that we give a f*ck about everything, but we only have so much time on Earth and so many f*cks to give and we have to choose who and what we spend those f*cks on. Makes sense.Unfortunately, the rest of the book turns into the same self-help drivel you see in any other ""how to be happy"" kind of book, only Manson starts to present the information with a tone reminiscent of an Andrew Dice Clay routine. No bueno. I ended up having to bail."

Well, I agree with everything Manson says, but (like other reviewers have mentioned) everything he's written about is common sense stuff. Is that revolutionary?Maybe.What does it say about our society in general that any of what he's saying is...well, remotely necessary to say!?When the basic premise of a bestseller is that you should stop comparing yourself to what you see on television, movies, and social media, and just be content to be the best version of yourself - and scads of people find this to be awe-inspiring? Then perhaps it really did need to be said.The gist of this ""groundbreaking"" book is that there's no way to insulate yourself from bad times, and even if you could, those hardships are what make us better people. One of the biggest problems we seem to have is this nonsensical idea that chasing happiness is a worthwhile goal. I mean, it sounds great on paper, but it's not in any way, shape, or form realistic...or healthy. Life will not give you a happy ending. Period. Endings are always sad. And we need to get over this ridiculous idea that at some point we'll get to sigh a big sigh of relief because our fairytale Happily Ever After has arrived.We can all save ourselves the trouble of trying to find happiness by just realizing that we need to choose to be happy now. Enjoy the small stuff, my friends, because tomorrow might just suck a giant dick. Your life will be good until it isn't. You'll be in love until you aren't. Your job will be fulfilling until you lose it. You'll be alive until you're dead. And nothing you do will change that.Ok, granted, that doesn't sound awesome.But the point is, if you stop trying to live for some future Happiness High, prioritize what means the most to you now, and live with a fearless attitude towards the future? Then you're going to be much more content (and yes, happy) than someone who is constantly trying to measure up to unrealistic goals they've set in order achieve a sense of fulfillment.The end.The book itself is fairly short and Manson's voice isn't terribly annoying.Read it or not. I don't give a fuck."

20,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23381142-natalie,Rating 4 out of 5,"I went into this admittedly with quite some skepticism and entitlement— “what is this going to teach me that I don’t already know?”— but The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck is truly one of the most ground-shaping nonfiction books I’ve read so far. It will and can change a perspective, a life. And as such, this is the perfect book to give to your loved ones on holidays, birthdays...It made me rethink all the times I ever gave a fuck over some of the most irrelevant things in hindsight. It made me realize that it’s sometimes necessary to take a step back and re-evaluate why I think so-and-so on a daily basis.I also wrote down a lot of Mark Manson’s writing into my notes because I knew I would need it in the near future. And I would like to thank him for answering quite a lot of fears of mine with such a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth.The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck was both personally relevant and entertaining.Here are a few pieces that helped me and then some:“The key to a good life is not giving a fuck about more; it’s giving a fuck about less, giving a fuck about only what is true and immediate and important.”“Because when you give too many fucks—when you give a fuck about everyone and everything—you will feel that you’re perpetually entitled to be comfortable and happy at all times, that everything is supposed to be just exactly the fucking way you want it to be. This is a sickness. And it will eat you alive. You will see every adversity as an injustice, every challenge as a failure, every inconvenience as a personal slight, every disagreement as a betrayal. You will be confined to your own petty, skull-sized hell, burning with entitlement and bluster, running circles around your very own personal Feedback Loop from Hell, in constant motion yet arriving nowhere”YES! This is exactly how I feel when I give too many fucks about things that have little lasting impact on my life.“Life is essentially an endless series of problems, Mark,” the panda told me. He sipped his drink and adjusted the little pink umbrella. “The solution to one problem is merely the creation of the next one.”A moment passed, and then I wondered where the fuck the talking panda came from. And while we’re at it, who made these margaritas?“Don’t hope for a life without problems,” the panda said. “There’s no such thing. Instead, hope for a life full of good problems.”Disappointment Panda was one of the best additions to this book.“Who you are is defined by what you’re willing to struggle for. People who enjoy the struggles of a gym are the ones who run triathlons and have chiseled abs and can bench-press a small house. People who enjoy long workweeks and the politics of the corporate ladder are the ones who fly to the top of it. People who enjoy the stresses and uncertainties of the starving artist lifestyle are ultimately the ones who live it and make it.This is not about willpower or grit. This is not another admonishment of “no pain, no gain.” This is the most simple and basic component of life: our struggles determine our successes. Our problems birth our happiness, along with slightly better, slightly upgraded problems.See: it’s a never-ending upward spiral. And if you think at any point you’re allowed to stop climbing, I’m afraid you’re missing the point. Because the joy is in the climb itself.”This book is slowly but surely shifting my world.“If you want to change how you see your problems, you have to change what you value and/or how you measure failure/success.”“Honesty is a good value because it’s something you have complete control over, it reflects reality, and it benefits others (even if it’s sometimes unpleasant). Popularity, on the other hand, is a bad value. If that’s your value, and if your metric is being the most popular guy/girl at the dance party, much of what happens will be out of your control: you don’t know who else will be at the event, and you probably won’t know who half those people are. Second, the value/metric isn’t based on reality: you may feel popular or unpopular, when in fact you have no fucking clue what anybody else really thinks about you. (Side Note: As a rule, people who are terrified of what others think about them are actually terrified of all the shitty things they think about themselves being reflected back at them.)”That side note is speaking the truth!!!“I’m not saying that this excused what my ex did—not at all. But recognizing my mistakes helped me to realize that I perhaps hadn’t been the innocent victim I’d believed myself to be. That I had a role to play in enabling the shitty relationship to continue for as long as it did. After all, people who date each other tend to have similar values. And if I dated someone with shitty values for that long, what did that say about me and my values? I learned the hard way that if the people in your relationships are selfish and doing hurtful things, it’s likely you are too, you just don’t realize it.”Taking responsibly for your actions, but not blaming yourself was one of the most valuable lessons I got from Mark Manson.“A lot of people might hear all of this and then say something like, “Okay, but how? I get that my values suck and that I avoid responsibility for all of my problems and that I’m an entitled little shit who thinks the world should revolve around me and every inconvenience I experience—but how do I change?”And to this I say, in my best Yoda impersonation: “Do, or do not; there is no ‘how.’ ”You are already choosing, in every moment of every day, what to give a fuck about, so change is as simple as choosing to give a fuck about something else.It really is that simple. It’s just not easy.It’s not easy because you’re going to feel like a loser, a fraud, a dumbass at first. You’re going to be nervous. You’re going to freak out. You may get pissed off at your wife or your friends or your father in the process. These are all side effects of changing your values, of changing the fucks you’re giving. But they are inevitable.It’s simple but really, really hard.”“Growth is an endlessly iterative process. When we learn something new, we don’t go from “wrong” to “right.” Rather, we go from wrong to slightly less wrong. And when we learn something additional, we go from slightly less wrong to slightly less wrong than that, and then to even less wrong than that, and so on. We are always in the process of approaching truth and perfection without actually ever reaching truth or perfection.”He’s changing my world right now.“We all have values for ourselves. We protect these values. We try to live up to them and we justify them and maintain them. Even if we don’t mean to, that’s how our brain is wired. As noted before, we’re unfairly biased toward what we already know, what we believe to be certain. If I believe I’m a nice guy, I’ll avoid situations that could potentially contradict that belief. If I believe I’m an awesome cook, I’ll seek out opportunities to prove that to myself over and over again. The belief always takes precedence. Until we change how we view ourselves, what we believe we are and are not, we cannot overcome our avoidance and anxiety. We cannot change.In this way, “knowing yourself” or “finding yourself” can be dangerous. It can cement you into a strict role and saddle you with unnecessary expectations. It can close you off to inner potential and outer opportunities.I say don’t find yourself. I say never know who you are. Because that’s what keeps you striving and discovering. And it forces you to remain humble in your judgments and accepting of the differences in others.”I didn't even realize I felt this way until I saw it so clearly on paper.“There’s a kind of self-absorption that comes with fear based on an irrational certainty. When you assume that your plane is the one that’s going to crash, or that your project idea is the stupid one everyone is going to laugh at, or that you’re the one everyone is going to choose to mock or ignore, you’re implicitly telling yourself, “I’m the exception; I’m unlike everybody else; I’m different and special.”This is narcissism, pure and simple. You feel as though your problems deserve to be treated differently, that your problems have some unique math to them that doesn’t obey the laws of the physical universe.My recommendation: don’t be special; don’t be unique. Redefine your metrics in mundane and broad ways. Choose to measure yourself not as a rising star or an undiscovered genius. Choose to measure yourself not as some horrible victim or dismal failure. Instead, measure yourself by more mundane identities: a student, a partner, a friend, a creator.”That thing about the plane is 100% me!! So I get it know: if you think you’re special—decide not to be.“The desire to avoid rejection at all costs, to avoid confrontation and conflict, the desire to attempt to accept everything equally and to make everything cohere and harmonize, is a deep and subtle form of entitlement. Entitled people, because they feel as though they deserve to feel great all the time, avoid rejecting anything because doing so might make them or someone else feel bad. And because they refuse to reject anything, they live a valueless, pleasure-driven, and self-absorbed life. All they give a fuck about is sustaining the high a little bit longer, to avoid the inevitable failures of their life, to pretend the suffering away.”“If you make a sacrifice for someone you care about, it needs to be because you want to, not because you feel obligated or because you fear the consequences of not doing so. If your partner is going to make a sacrifice for you, it needs to because he or she genuinely wants to, not because you’ve manipulated the sacrifice through anger or guilt. Acts of love are valid only if they’re performed without conditions or expectations.”

Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || PinterestPsychological snake oil for the pseudo intellectual.Man, reading this book was so frustrating, because I'd heard so many good things. Some people told me that this book was life-changing, game-changing, and then one of my co-workers gave it to me and I thought, ""Cool, bring it on. I'm ready to hand out fuck-wafers like it's time for the Sunday Communion of Nobody-Gives-A-Damn."" After reading this book, I've come to the conclusion that the people who like this book haven't taken any psychology classes or read any philosophy books, because this is like the watered-down, urban legend- and common sense-based rehashing of basic tenets you would learn in Phi or Psych 101. Mark Manson seems to me like a dudebro, tossing around the word ""fuck"" like a preteen who's just discovered swearing. But only for the first couple chapters. Then he forgets himself to his navel-gazing, talking about how we should change our values in life and how emotions only affect us insofar as we let them. Which is true, to an extent, but then he brings up how someone who had lost their son prematurely got mad at him on his blog, and Manson gets so upset about it that he feels the need to whine about his experience here, bragging to us about how he decided not to have the last word. But isn't that what you're doing here? You are giving a fuck, and you are immortalizing that fuck you gave in print, while telling us simultaneously that you did not give it. Hmm, sketchy.He also talks about his trip to Russia and praises the Russians for not sugar-coating and telling it like it is, the takeaway being that he admired them for saying ""That's stupid,"" when someone says something stupid. Then he brags about how he likes to tell his wife when she doesn't look good, and how much she appreciates this gaslighting, and how few men would dare to do this amazing thing that he is doing (telling her she looks like shit, according to him). She gets angry, he says, but ultimately she appreciates his honesty. Yeah, I fucking bet. This was straight out of those gross pick-up artist books that teach generations of young males how to neg women to win sex points. #NotAllMenManson had a couple good points, but they were buried in a lot of garbage. For example, in a chapter about relationships, he opens up with the synopsis of Romeo and Juliet as a cautionary example, but then he also tries to namedrop actual science like Philip Zimbardo's Stanford Prison Experiments, and then also namedrops the Buddha when talking about suffering and the inevitability of pain and strife. I am a psychology major who worked in a research laboratory as an undergraduate and I like hard science with data and solid case examples. When I see an article that looks fishy, I look up the facts to determine whether or not it is true. I read scholarly articles. I don't fuck with bullshit. I would rather give a fuck than fuck with bullshit, if you get me. This book did not have facts. It had a lot of opinions masquerading with facts, but honestly, if I want someone to preach dime-store philosophy at me, I'll go to a bar in downtown San Francisco and listen to the vodka fume revelations of CFOs.2 fucks given"

Ca să fii fericit, crede Manson, se cuvine:- Să-ți pese cu adevărat doar de chestiile importante; le poți număra pe degetele unei singure mîini. Dar cum deosebești chestiile importante de cele neimportante, dai cu banul?- Să nu-ți pese de ce gîndesc alții despre tine, să nu te enervezi la cap :). Nervii, invidia, ura nu duc la fericire. Cred și eu. Oricum, Nietzsche a spus-o mult mai bine, acum o sută și ceva de ani: „Smulge din tine buruiana resentimentului!”.- Să-ți alegi un scop în viață, dar să știi că nu împlinirea scopului, ci drumul pînă la el te face fericit. Dacă ai realizat ceva și te oprești (ca să-ți serbezi succesul), fericirea te părăsește cu grăbire.- Să nu-ți faci probleme pentru evenimentele care se petrec oricum, indiferent că vrei sau nu vrei. Nu poți controla totul. Unele lucruri (cele mai multe) nu sînt în puterea ta, altele (foarte puține) sînt. De pildă, modul de a judeca lucrurile care nu sînt în puterea ta. Sigur, Epictet și Seneca au spus asta cu mult timp în urmă, dar nu strică s-o repeți. Repetitio mater studiorum est...- Să nu-ți dorești o experiență pozitivă (mai mult sex, să spunem), pentru că vei încerca, în realitate, o experiență negativă. Dar dacă accepți o experiență negativă, poți trăi una pozitivă.- Ferește-te de plăceri: sînt nocive! Antihedonismul lui Mark Manson e mai vechi decît Seneca.- Nu fugi de suferințe! Viața înseamnă să-ți asumi suferința. Suferința face parte din viață. Cît trăiești, suferi, dar dacă suferi, asta înseamnă foarte precis că ești încă viu :)Mă opresc aici.

In essence, the question is, should I really give a f*ck?  This is sort of an anti-hero self-help book, something you should read (or hear) if you feel the world weighing up a little bit too much. It just unburdens you of some stuff. No real groundbreaking philosophy, just a couple of useful hints and insights on how to take things more lightly, when taking them seriously is hurting you. Chapters 1 and 2 were pure magic. The kind of magic that wouldn't be too bad to hear once or twice a year. If not for the hints, for the laughs. There are also some interesting comments on chapter 8, and some anecdotes here and there. The rest of the book was kind of meh. Funny meh, sure, but typical self-help textbook lines that tires a bit, if not a lot. Couldn't be happier to have chosen audio rather than ebook. Cursing can seem very aggressive when reading it on text, but hearing it through the voice of the narrator it became so much easier, and funnier. Tips: Don't take it too seriously, develop a tolerance to hear the word f*ck once too many often, and just enjoy the ride.-----------------------------------------------
PERSONAL NOTE
: [2016] [212p] [Inspirational] [Conditional Recommendable] ----------------------------------------------- No es sobre que nada te importe un c*rajo. Es sobre que te importe un c*rajo sólo las cosas importantes. En esencia, la pregunta es, debería realmente importame un c*rajo?  Este es como el anti-heroe de los libros de autoayuda. Algo que uno debería leer (o escuchar) si empezás a sentír que el mundo te pesa mucho sobre los hombros. Sólo te libera de algunas cosas. No tiene ninguna filosofía innovadora, sólo un par de consejos y observaciones sobre cómo tomar las cosas más ligeramente, cuando tomártelas en serio te hace daño.Los capítulos 1 y 2 fueron pura magia. Ese tipo de magia que no viene mal escucharla una o dos veces al año. Sino por los consejos, por las risas. Tiene también algunos comentarios interesantes en el capítulo 8, y alguna que otra anéctoda aquí y allá. El resto del libro es medio meh, meh gracioso sí, pero típica retórica de autoayuda que cansa un poco, sino mucho.No podría estar más feliz de haberlo escuchado en vez de leerlo. Las puteadas pueden sonar muy agresivas cuando uno las lee en texto, pero escucharlas a través de la voz del narrador hace que sea mucho más ameno, y gracioso.Consejos: No tomarlo muy en serio, desarrollar una tolerancia a escuchar puteadas algo más que seguido, y sólo disfrutar el viaje.-----------------------------------------------

 This book has made a significant impact in recent times in the life of readers (both in a positive and negative way). Let us analyze whether it differs from other books published with similar ideas.
The Good 
🔸 This is one of the first books where the author was bold enough to discuss the toxic positivity spread by self-help books and self-help gurus. It will help those trapped in the vicious cycle of toxic positivity.🔸 This is different from the usual self-help books, right from the color of its cover and its title. Due to its presentation and content, this book will stand out and catch a glimpse of the reader in any bookstore.🔸 Some ideas regarding life and future expectations explained by the author will definitely resonate with the readers.
My favorite three lines from this book. 


 “The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience. ”


 “This is the most simple and basic component of life: our struggles determine our successes.”

 “Don’t just sit there. Do something. The answers will follow.”

The Bad 
🔹 Using the f word will be ok to most of the readers. But in the initial few chapters, the reader is bombarded with too many f words in a patronizing manner that the reader will start getting bored when he sees the f word.🔹 If you are familiar with Zen Buddhism, you will notice that the author is mentioning many Buddhist ideas as his own in a slightly different manner. 🔹 Some of the chapters in the latter half of this book seem to be loosely written.
The Ugly 
♦️ This will be the toughest part to read for some of the readers. Sexual abuse can never be considered a joke. The way the author looks at sexual abuse will make the reader angry if you are a victim or knows someone who is a victim or have treated someone who is a victim. This is the area that makes the author and this book look ludicrous. ♦️ The use of “charged language” and a harsh approach to the reader might be acceptable to a certain extent. In some areas, the author crosses the boundary and reaches the bullying territory, especially how he looks at victimhood.There are so many positives and negatives to this book. Since this is one of the first books that tried to view self-help from a different angle, it will be a good choice for those who want to get a different reading experience."
25,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn,Rating 3 out of 5,"A lot of necessary to hear hard truths.There is a distinction between what the title implies and what Manson intends. Manson is essentially inviting us to only care about what’s important and let the rest take care of itself.I’ve been accused of indifference or “living in a bubble” for years because I don’t follow politics and rarely watch the news. My mantra is the serenity prayer:God grant me the serenityto accept the things I cannot change; courage to change the things I can; and wisdom to know the difference.My Muslim friends will sometimes say “Inshallah” which literally translates into “if Allah wills it” or “If God wills it”. When I first heard this, I mistakenly thought it was akin to “screw it” or “I don’t care” but I think this is more similar to the serenity prayer and also what Manson is talking about.I learned years ago that I cannot help or fix everything and to even try is unfair to me, the people I most care about and ultimately the people I am trying to help also. Spread yourself too thin, care too much, give a f*** about stuff that is beyond your reach, and you’re setting yourself up for failure.Manson steers clear of religion for the most part (he does reference Buddhism a few times) and most of his self-help is philosophical in nature. He also provides plenty of illuminating anecdotes to illustrate his perspicacious observations. This also made me consider Aaron James’ 2012 book Assholes: A Theory as Manson spends a fair amount of time describing the actions and motivations of those among us who feel entitled.A fun and insightful book.** 2018 - Great book to think back on and its simple truths. I do give a f***, but I can't fix everything and I accept that. Ultimately its about boundaries and priorities. "

27,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,Rating 3 out of 5,"My sister asked me to get her this and I’ve read it as well. It is basically the Buddha and Sartre giving advice by saying fuck every other word. Not a terrible thing, in itself, but a bit like seeing a play where all the actors are naked, the swearing loses its impact after about the third fuck, and then you’re just left with the advice.I don’t normally read self-help books – the problem I have with them is the first word, more than the second. We generally all need some sort of help, but that rarely is helped much by any notion of ‘self’. Ultimately, this guy says much the same thing, which rather surprised me, but shouldn’t have – I’ve already mentioned Buddhism, which has a particularly low opinion of selfhood. But we are so obsessed with being individuals in our society that he probably didn’t feel he could just come out and say from the start – well, get over yourself, fuck face.His advice is basically that you only have so many fucks you can give in life – but life tries to structure itself so that we are in a near perpetual state of outrage. And that way heart attacks lie. His advice isn’t to stop caring, that would be impossible, but to try to decide what you are going to care about and, well, do something about that. In some ways this isn’t too different from something I read by Byung-Chul Han recently – that outrage never changed the world, only rage can. So, pick what you are going to be enraged about and skip the outrage.This isn’t a terrible book, in fact, most of the advice is quite reasonable. All the same, I feel most of the problems we face as humans are to do with the fact we are social animals and our lives are becoming increasingly insular – not least due to various forms of technology – and this is making us feel pretty awful about ourselves. We need to find ways to rebuild communities and meaningful human interactions. And we’ve known this for ages – have a quick read of Durkheim’s Suicide and his explanation of why Catholics and Jews have lower rates of suicide than Protestants. Our obsession with being individuals is literally killing us. The fact this guy bases much of his advice on psychology, to me anyway, is part of the problem – I figure it involves him looking intently down the wrong end of the telescope – but all the same, this is a quick and easy read and parts of it are amusing."

The book is a reaction to the self-help industry and what Manson saw as a culture of mindless positivity that isn't practical or helpful for most people. Manson uses many of his own personal experiences to illustrate how life's struggles often give it more meaning, which, he argues, is a better approach than constantly trying to be happy. Manson's approach and writing style have been categorized by some as contrarian to the general self-help industry, using blunt honesty and profanity to illustrate his ideas.The book has 9 chapters with the following titles:1. Don't Try,2. Happiness is a problem,3. You are not special,4. The value of suffering,5. You are always choosing,6. You are wrong about everything (But so am I),7. Failure is the way forward,8. The importance of saying no,and 9.

And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one's negative experience is itself a positive experience."" I don't know how to review this book without typing out the whole book, so I'm going to try something different: to be brief. This book provides support for someone who wants to live in reality, someone who doesn't want to buy into our national capitalist mindset that life is about chasing one high after another. This book encourages you to embrace conflict, to be comfortable feeling uncomfortable, and to be confident in finding out what you truly believe in, then standing up for it. Fuck being likeable. Take responsibility for your own life, stop trying to solve other's problems (a big one for me to work on!), ask questions, and always try to make things better. ""Happiness is a struggle.""My one criticism of this book eventually turned into a positive. Around Chapter Six my interest started to wane because Manson provided me with very little I didn't already know. Plus, he shares his own story about entering his adult life at ""rock bottom."" His life's lowest points: getting caught with marijuana at school, his parents' divorce, not finding a job immediately after college. My initial reaction was, are you fucking kidding me? If that's rock bottom, my life exists in a subterranean cavern. However, Mark Manson's life is not mine. Everyone's experiences are subjective. And, in a way, I admire him even more because of our differences. He led an easy life compared to mine, but he recognized his own privileges and entitlements and worked toward fixing them. Then, he took his own personal realizations about life and shared them in this book, which in turn helps me and others. I rarely read a book that makes me want to thank the author, but -- Thanks for this, Mark. "

Who cares if there are tons of curses in it? Everything he says or teaches us is always followed or introduced with a personal or historical story. There are always examples, stories, explanations that are not overly complicated. The whole book was full of honest, true and really interesting stuff. These were my favorite: - Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent, it means being comfortable with being different. - Pain, in all of its forms, is our body’s most effective means of spurring action. - People who become great at something become great because they understand that they’re not already great - they are mediocre, they are average - and that they could be so much better. - Self-awareness is like an onion. There are multiple layers to it, and the more you peel them back, the more likely you’re going to start crying at inappropriate times. - This is because you always get to choose how you see things, how you react to things, how you value things. - Until we change how we view ourselves, what we believe we are and are not, we cannot overcome our avoidance and anxiety. We cannot change. - If you’re stuck on a problem, don’t sit there and think about it, just start working on it. Even if you don’t know what you’re doing, the simple act of working on it will eventually cause the right ideas to show up in your head. - You too are going to die, and that’s because you too were fortunate enough to have lived. All in all I’ll just recommend this to all my non-reader friends and to you, my wonderful Goodreads people, because I loved it and I want you to read this too! Happy reading ♥️"

I probably need to read another self-help book about how to recover mentally from a bad self-help book. The fact that it is still on the ‘top ten’ rack at the local bookstore after so long made me curious enough to give it a bash … Bad, bad decision.One of my fellow Goodreaders describes it as Stoicism and Buddhism for dudebros, which is pretty spot-on. Manson’s chummy narrative tone is equal parts condescending and irritating; the ‘advice’ he dispenses is pretty self-explanatory, not to mention glaringly obvious and common-sense in many instances.I don’t think the humour works that well, to be honest, as it is often too flippant and glib – not the ideal ‘vibe’ to convince people how best to change their sucky lives. Manson comes across as trying way too hard to be a cool-cat graduate from the School of Hard Knocks. I wonder what millennials think of this? There is a pretty good Star Wars joke though. This should definitely come with a mental health warning."

And that’s perfectly fine. The point isn’t to get away from the shit. The point is to find the shit you enjoy dealing with.”“The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience”“Problems never stop; they merely get exchanged and/or upgraded. Happiness comes from solving meaningful problems.”"

The solution to one problem is merely the creation of another.”🌟 I am not a big fan of Self Help books to be honest. I try to avoid them as much as possible. I just believe that we all have different experiences and we will learn by trying. I also believe that most of what those Self help books are saying is just so obvious and I don’t need to read about it to know it. Despite that, I enjoyed the book and can not say that it won’t affect me one way or another.🌟 The book starts out by cussing, actually a lot! I was not happy by all of that Effing going around but then it became cooler and easier to read. There was a lot of repetition to be honest. Like the idea would be repeated too many times through different chapter in a kind of similar wording.🌟 I enjoyed the real life examples that the book provides and these are always better than the theoretical part. One of the things that I will be applying is to check which metric I am using. A concept that was discussed for the whole part of the book and I think it was the most important one. For example: As book bloggers we have to choose a metric: Is it going to be how much followers I have and having a certain goal in mind or comparing your follower to a large blog. In the first case, a blogger will be happy for example with 100 followers while in the later case, the blogger will keep trying to reach an ever-growing blog and will feel that they are not achieving anything.🌟 Summary: I know this book will not be for everyone and that many will hate it as evidenced by the many 1 stars in the top reviews pages on GR. I believe that you can get something out of this book even if you are not a fan of self-help books as me. I read it because I wanted a less stressful 2019 and I hope it helps me in achieving so. I ended up giving it 3.5 out of 5 stars."

Book has no originality and better writers have written more brilliantly about these topics. Entire thing boils down to irritating, naive, amateur psychology from a douchebag in serious ignorance of his douchebaggery. The book suffers from the problem of extremes. In this case, in attempting to correct for admittedly nauseating over positivity bullshit, the author is now guilty of the same crap in the opposite direction - an over glorification of suffering. This is just as much of a crap fest as what he claims to be avoiding. Laughable part is that dude is an entitled little shithead who's got no understanding of suffering. There's even more considerable lack of understanding of medical/scientific research and on some level he seems to believe that people with real psychological issues should just get over themselves cause everyone has problems. When a human being gets to a point where he can equate his self imposed drugged infused decade of ""trauma"" stemming from his parents divorce to the real trauma of a father losing his son, that's serious entitled bullshit! To conclude that someone who has suffered through hellish circumstances can just move on based on cherry picked examples of celebrities making it, is pathetically superficial. This kind of crappy thinking is what results in selfish individuals who can only empathize with others if they have gone through similar experiences themselves. Books like this don't move the dial in improving humanity, they just create/justify narcissistic characters who hide their narcissism behind a wall of false self improvement. This author is no different from the cultish positivity people he scorns. He spews the same sanctimonious, bullshit rhetoric where he pats himself on the back by stating how his values help make the world better! His whole unoriginal theory of put on your big boy panties and get over yourself mentality is just as terrible as the whole disappear into some zen bullshit crapfest. It's this kind of mentality that makes people say if I could make it, I don't get why anyone else can't either. It fails to recognize differences in circumstances. I'm all for suck it up and deal with life but the ability to fail to recognize that maybe the dad with the dead kid has suffered more pain than the asshole with the cheating ex girlfriend is ludicrous! What this guy has done is surround himself with folks so obviously dysfunctional, he ends up looking like the king in a world of spectacular ignorance. The question that should be asked as he gives multiple examples of his idiotic friends being assholes, is how has he managed to collect so many terrible people in his circle? What does this say about his values and judgement? In the end, author is no different from his douchebag ""friend"" he described in the earlier chapters except unlike the friend who limited himself to sponging off of relatives, this dude has expanded his narcissistic reach to a wider audience. Still playing the victim of the trauma of his parents divorce, still standing for nothing except the right to say what he wants, when he wants to whoever he wants. There's a word for people like that - douchebag! "
41,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35794399-rowan,Rating 2 out of 5,"This book was frustrating. There are some great words of wisdom here, but it requires one to chisel away all the crap surrounding them. It also probably doesn’t feature anything you don’t already know. In saying that, we can always do with friendly reminders; so, I persisted.I actually began this book a couple of years ago. I couldn’t suffer the author’s writing style, so abandoned it. Then my Mum (not knowing that) gifted it to me. I felt obligated to give it a proper go. I never truly got used to the writing style. It wasn’t the coarse language (I swear like a pirate), but the edgy teenager style of prose. I understand the whole tough-love thing, but sometimes this felt like someone launching a tirade at me. I generally only take advice from those I respect or admire, so it was challenging listening to an obnoxious former dating coach who grew up in a wealthy family. There’s both a lot here to digest (and also not a whole lot at all). It’s exceedingly short in length and quite a quick read. The 'acknowledgements' were onto something:“This book began as a big, messy thing and required more than just my own hands to chisel something comprehensible out of it.”I’d say the end result isn’t too far from the original product.So, the good parts? Well, I began to enjoy some of the chapters towards the end. I got a lot out of the rejection/failure and death chapters. I could more easily relate them to my own life and experiences. After all, there’s nothing like being reminded of our inevitable death to motivate us:“You too are going to die, and that’s because you too were fortunate enough to have lived.”The book is essentially about how to better focus your time and energies in life; ensuring that how we spend our time aligns with our values and what we consider important. It discusses healthy values vs toxic values, and reaffirms that time is precious, so we should direct our energies wisely. Learning to direct our energies to what matters most to us also means we need to learn to reject the things that don’t align. It also surmises that we’re guaranteed to fail and encounter problems in life – it’s just up to us to choose which problems we would rather deal with. Manson draws a lot from Buddhism and the Stoics. He basically dresses it up in a bro-tastic way. It made my head spin at times. I agreed with some of Manson’s views on current society, though I feel I would’ve got more out of this book had I read it as a teenager. He’s not a pleasant guy. At one point, he rips into a man who just lost his son for simply finding fault in his words. He’s an asshole in his relationships too. His definition of ‘unconditional love’ is basically 'loving and caring about your partner regardless of her values and what's important to her' (though not quite said in those words). He then proceeds to claim honesty is a key value in his relationship; which supposedly green lights him to insult his wife about her appearance after she has spent considerable time getting ready to go out. This completely contradicts itself, besides bordering on abuse. I had to sometimes separate the author from the content to better appreciate it. Some of the best advice didn’t come from Manson, but his math teacher instead:“If you’re stuck on a problem, don’t sit there and think about it; just start working on it. Even if you don’t know what you’re doing, the simple act of working on it will eventually cause the right ideas to show up in your head.”I enjoyed some of the example stories that were used to illustrate various points. But these could be hit or miss too. Some of my favourite stories were about Pete Best (original Beatles drummer) and William James. I felt the story about the Japanese soldier failed to be relevant.After a while, this book did get me questioning my own beliefs – which is probably a good thing. It’s heavy on the realist side of things which is different to most self-help books I have read.“Constant positivity is a form of avoidance. When we force ourselves to stay positive, we deny the existence of life’s problems. If we deny our problems, we rob ourselves the chance to solve them.”I considered the do-something principle one of the strongest points of the book. It was something I needed. “You can become your own source of inspiration.”When simply ‘doing something’ is your only metric for success, then even failure can push you forward. Has this book changed my life? No. But once I looked past everything I disliked about it, the author, and occasional contradictions; it got me reflecting on my own life in what can only be positive ways."
42,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16131467-nate-icart,Rating 1 out of 5,"I absolutely hated this book. Reasons why:-The author's jokes were terrible. His style of humor is just to add a random number to an example (""I felt like I was punched 253 times in the stomach""). -Many (most) of the concepts in this book are ripped from common bodies of knowledge (he explains the basic economic concept of opportunity cost like he was the one who discovered it)-His experiences all feel fake. He talks about how came to deep realizations about his life when we was a fresh college graduate -- not that this is impossible, just very unlikely.-The first few chapters have the word ""Fuck"" in them so much that it just feels like he's making excuses to say it. I like swearing, but every time he talks about sex he calls it ""fucking"". No one talks like that.-It's very hard to take a 32 year old self-help guru seriously when they don't have a real life like the rest of us. He's been a world-traveler and an extremely popular blogger for years. He explained that he only held a ""real"" job for 6 weeks post-graduation. Who can relate to this?-The best part about this book is the cover. Manson is good at marketing, and he's good in short-form (like on his blog), but I will never read another book that he writes."

Instead I got a collection of banal insights, wrapped in supposedly funny dirty-talk. References to philosophy/literature were reminiscent of an author who just skimmed through ""100 ideas in X you need to know"" and didn't bother further. They were forced and off-beat especially considering the overall tone, which itself fluctuated between the earnestness of self-help drivel and the tongue-in-cheek of comedy memoirs. Ironically, this was the only convincing argument made to support the point on making choices to narrow down your options. Looks like the author didn’t even follow his own advice."

I don't know why but it comes across as so pretentious to me, and hearing Mark Manson ramble on for so long about ""not giving a fuck"" and ""only giving a fuck about the things that matter"" it just felt to me like he was trying too hard. Also, he's a privileged white man and some of this felt very douche-y to me. Like him talking about how he tells his wife when she doesn't look good because honesty is more important... like okay.

Como me suele pasar con este tipo de lecturas, estoy bastante de acuerdo con la filosofía con la que están escritos… pero una cosa es predicar, y otra, muy distinta, es dar trigo. Básicamente la idea que transmite es que te tomes en serio solo las cosas que lo merecen, que en realidad son pocas, y el resto, pues eso, que las mandes al carajo. Estoy de acuerdo. La vida te pone por delante momentos difíciles, y tú poco o nada puedes hacer por evitarlo. Pues al carajo. El autor pone mucho empeño en repetirte que, hagas lo que hagas, al final serás polvo cósmico, igual que esas estrellas mediáticas a las cuales adoras y sigues con pasión. No intentes cambiar lo que no está en tu mano, y lo que está, inténtalo con fruición. O sea, elige bien tus carajos. Todo esto aderezado con toques de humor y anécdotas personales, ya que parece que Manson está muy viajado y baqueteado por los cuatro puntos cardinales del planeta. Pues vale. Pero al final del libro te preguntarás si has aprendido a llevar mejor tu vía crucis personal. Ahí cada uno lo verá según le vaya la feria de la vida. La realidad, si nos desprendemos de los cientos de veces que utiliza la palabra f*ck (en inglés su lectura puede resultar ofensiva para cierto tipo de lectores), de alguna anécdota interesante, de alguna reseña sobre algún personaje relevante, y de algún que otro toque de humor, la realidad, repito, es que no hay nada nuevo bajo el sol, sino lo mismo escrito por otro autor.

Even if, sometimes, you should say never.Mark Manson likes the word fuck. As an English learner - as in it's not my first language and I definitely don't speak it perfectly -, I find myself using this same word a lot to point out my opinion. Did it bother me? Not particularly but, since some people have complained about it, I’d like to support them by saying that it's mostly childish. I mean, he's a grown-ass man talking like a college dude about random stuff. That's the help he offers.His success comes from the fact that he tells people to do the opposite of what everyone has always told them: don't try, you’re nobody, happiness is impossible, own your sadness. He's not wrong - most of the time he has a good explanation for his beliefs -, but there’s nothing concrete in them. “Real happiness is impossible, just try for a good life” is something I say to myself every time I want to quit my life, but there's a difference between thinking and acting.Some things are quite right and even helpful. For example, the introduction is one of the best things I've read in a while; he doesn't just explain what to do and how, he also empathizes with the reader and gets to us.The rest, tho, is just random stuff about him or popular knowledge that everyone can look up without meaning in how is it supposed to help us.Long story short, the flaws of the book are two: 1. he minimizes too much when he can't actually give a piece of advice - if you can't reach happiness, just solve the problem that stops you from it; where the fuck do you put trauma?! 2. and his tone just asks you to punch him. He's this big man with all the answers when, in reality, he's fucking not and doesn’t know shit about you.He did teach me one good thing: you should learn what to care for by asking yourself “Do I actually care?”. The answer about this book is “No”.↠ 2 stars"

It starts off really well but then starts to drag out. The things mentioned in the book are logical and make immense sense, they're also presented with interesting and sometimes personal issues to get the idea. The author's writing is straight to the point and natural; it flows like a conversation rather than a self-help rant. All this, and I still couldn't find much enthusiasm for the things being said because I find them to be basic things that I've always believed in.It did give me a few things to consider and maybe lookup.  The main point of this book is that we always choose how we feel. Other people may do things that create an emotion in us however you are always responsible for how you feel and how you handle things.

51,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59050228-meike,Rating 2 out of 5,"This has some unsettling Jordan B. Peterson vibes, in as far as it does address some truths that are probably uncomfortable for some people, but then suddenly takes the wrong turn. For example, Manson argues that instead of lamenting about random destiny, we should take responsibility for our reactions to it - which is true, but (in best Ayn Rand manner) disregards the fact that people have to overcome their individual gripes and stand together in solidarity to overcome systemic issues, which is much more effective than just individually dealing with them. Plus Manson holds the conviction that he knows what gives life meaning, disregarding that - wait for it! - this might be different for everybody. Also, Manson thinks that open words matter (true), but then conveys to us that he has found a bastion of free, direct speech, where opinions are just spoken aloud and not sugarcoated like in the West, and this bastion is... Russia. I wish I was kidding. Again, Manson might have had this impression personally, but good luck individually taking charge of your destiny when you publicly proclaim in St. Petersberg that Putin is a dictator who needs to be ousted. All in all, it seems like a stretch to me that this is some kind of intro to buddhism or philosophical rendering - it's mildly entertaining, but very simplistic and sometimes outright stupid."

55,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5610133-sologdin,Rating 1 out of 5,"Dunno what I’m doing with all these self-help/pop-psych books. Must’ve lost my motherfucking mind in 2017.This one attempts to elevate the basic operating premise of the lumpenized antisocial nihilist to the level of a ‘subtle art.’ It is of course neither subtle nor an art, but is rather the irreducible Real for many existing along the bottom stratum of postmodern capitalism, as handily conceded early by the author when he considers that “giving a fuck about more stuff is good for business” (5) and concludes, contrary to the prior consideration, “And while there’s nothing wrong with good business [wut?], the problem is that giving too many fucks is bad for your mental health” (id.). This is less throwing the baby out with the bath water than throwing out the baby and keeping the bath water. He affirms that we all [!] have ‘first world problems’ because “everyone has a flat screen TV” (8). Huh? “Our crisis is no longer material” (id.), which kinda limits the application of these ideas to those whose struggle for material existence has come to conclusion—which equates to the wealthy and the dead. The object here is to learn “how to pick and choose what matters to you” (13), which is the worst sort of causeless immaterialism—as though one might control one’s desires and emotions as a matter of will. He does not recommend a “serene indifference to everything” (14), which is, he contends, psychopathy. (Serene indifference to most things, especially asinine things, is by contrast adiaphora, the main virtue of Diogenes.) Rather, he wants a “practical enlightenment,” the restructuring of life expectations (21), which, I suspect, will happen to everyone regardless of conscious intention.Reasoning from the Buddhist principle that life is suffering (25), he ends up at an unacknowledged agambenian position that ��happiness is a form of action” (31), the latter of which phrases we might shoehorn into Agamben’s notion of a ‘form of life,” the eidos zoe of the Homo Sacer texts. The presentation here is of course much more pedestrian, and this section amounts to a fairly routine rumination on items consistent with pragmatism, the Stoics, and Sun Tzu. He’ll want readers to accept the position that they are not really exceptional and that their actions don’t matter very much—reminiscent of Vonnegut’s notion that we should prepare kids for failure rather than success because failure is the main thing that’s going to happen to them.Some content given to the eidos zoe proposed above. Bizarre positive presentation of a fascist in the post-WWII world: “what he found when he returned to Japan horrified him: a consumerist, capitalist, superficial culture that had lost all of the traditions of honor and sacrifice upon which his generation had been raised” (69)—say what you want, at least it’s an ethos?He’ll endorse otherwise the fairly reasonable position that “once one is able to provide for basic physical needs (food, shelter, and so on), the correlation between happiness and worldly success quickly approaches zero” (82). Fair enough, as far as it goes; the problem is that the and so on is the locus of much contention. The basic liberal position should be ‘far be it from me to opine upon the market participation of other market participants,’ and the Marxist position should be, ‘yeah, sure, though once old needs are satisfied, capitalism produces bona fide new needs.' The combination of these two principles means that the “basic physical needs” idea, supra, is irredeemably rightwing and parcel to a world that no longer exists, and indeed can never exist again, thank fucking goodness. Similarly insensitive to other imperatives of the market society of “good business” that this text appears to champion: “When people measure themselves by the status symbols they’re able to collect, then not only are they shallow, but they’re probably assholes as well” (83). (A shadow of Aaron James, there.)The argument adopts a philistine internal/external binary: “Bad values are generally reliant on external events […] while sometimes fun or pleasurable, lie outside your control and often require socially destructive or superstitious means to achieve” (87)--despite the endorsement of ""good business"" and thereby market participation, supra, surely the primary 'external' process for most in liberal society. By contrast, good values are “achieved internally.” One need only “orient your mind” (id.)—even assuming that the distinction is operative (it is not), there’s no indication on how this non-superstitious orientation is to be accomplished.Similarly, “we don’t always control what happens to us. But we always control how we interpret what happens to us” (94), as though the mind’s processes were fully subject to conscious control, whatever that might be. Very much crypto-objectivist in proclaiming that “we are always choosing the values by which we live” (95), which is of course silly and ahistoricist. It likewise has the consequence of casting those persons who have fallen to the bottom of a society in which there’s nothing wrong with “good business” as the villains in their own tragedy. Y’all just done choosed the wrong values; that’s why you were born into poverty. “Nobody else is ever responsible for your situation but you” (99). Statements such as “How he reacted to his son’s death was his own choice” (104) empty the notion of choice of the content that author needs it to retain.Standard internet rightwing agitation here in ""people get addicted to feeling offended all the time because it gives them a high"" (112) (…wut).Some interest for fans of the RSB here in “Certainty is the enemy of growth” (119).Wants people to give up their “sense of entitlement” (141), as though this can be done as a matter of will. Probably similar genre(s) as James' Assholes and Frankfurt's On Bullshit, which are a bit more rigorous.Anyway, plenty of brief rumination in the customary pop-psych-as-applied-to-business style, looking at Milgram, Dabrowski, Becker, and so on."

What a simple but profound read.
I find myself rereading this book every couple years since it's release and when I'm done I realize why; it provides a kind of grounding or electrical earthing in shocking me into the remembrance of everything (conceptual outlooks, beliefs, biases, and general thoughts) that do/don't matter to me in life and prods me into bringing back my ever widening and detrimental focus (of superficial concepts, beliefs and my never ending need in catering and wanting to indulge in baseless conformity within my social structure and culture) to the things I deem truly worth my while and important in pursuance of a life I will be proud of later on.I'd urge any reader looking for something that the writing stays light while dealing in truly insightful and profound ideas to read this.

And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience.""I never thought of reading this book. Saw a hype about it recently in a group on facebook. So I just wanted to know what this book is about. After reading the blurb on goodreads, I thought to give it a go, see what's the hype about. So I started listening to the audiobook. ""Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent; it means being comfortable with being different.""First thing I learned from this book is, never judge a book by its cover or title or first chapter. In the first chapter, the author said f*ck like a 100 times. I think there was no need to said that word this many times. I don't have any problem with saying fuck. But when I read/listen to fuck this many times in just one chapter, I cannot help but feel irritated. So yeah, I was irritated but decided to go on. And I am glad of my decision. ""Maturity is what happens when one learns to only give a fuck about what’s truly fuckworthy.""I don't think this book is an inspiring one. The writer didn't want to tell people how to be motivated or how to be a successful person. He simply told how to be happy in life. What is the mantra behind peace and happiness in one's life. And I have to say I totally agree. And that mantra is not giving a fuck. Well, now some may think that not giving a fuck means being indifferent to everything. But that's not true. There's a very thin line between being indifferent and being indifferent to the things that are not important in life. Mark Manson talked about this difference and how we care about everything. In this book, he shared many of his thoughts about happiness, emotion, sufferings, values, responsibilities, rejections, and relations of our life. And I agree with most of the things he said. You can say I am bragging but I found that my thoughts and ideas about life are a lot like Mark Manson. And yes I was lame and pathetic once. But I am growing. I am learning the subtle art of not giving a fuck. ""Being wrong opens us up to the possibility of change. Being wrong brings the opportunity for growth.""One thing I love while reading something is when I find some character I can relate to real life. And this book was full of it. Sometimes I find someone who is exactly like my friend, then someone pretty much like my boss and finally someone a lot like me. It was a major point why I liked this book. ""There is a simple realization from which all personal improvement and growth emerge. This is the realization that we, individually, are responsible for everything in our lives, no matter the external circumstances. We don’t always control what happens to us. But we always control how we interpret what happens to us, as well as how we respond. Whether we consciously recognize it or not, we are always responsible for our experiences.""There's one thing that I didn't understand the last chapter. And I was thinking of giving a star less for it. Then I thought maybe I haven't grown that much yet. So yeah I will reread the last chapter after two or three years and see if it makes any sense. So 5 stars for now... :D ""To be happy we need something to solve. Happiness is, therefore, a form of action..."""

Eu não tenho problemas com livros deste género, adoro a temática. Estou sempre em busca de livros inspiradores, originais e criativos. Pensava que este livro seria assim. Estava tão enganada. Há semanas no top de vendas previa ser uma leitura espetacular. Não é, vão por mim. O livro não vale um caracol de tão mau. Primeiro, onde é que Mark sustenta a sua teoria? Na sua própria experiência. O que fez ele de sucesso? Conseguiu vencer muitos livros através do discurso patético armado em engraçado. Para mim livros destes são puro aproveitamento. Tenta impingir às pessoas uma teoria completamente maluca, cheia de exemplos que nada têm a ver com a realidade e as pessoas acreditam que ele está certo. Não vos faz lembrar nada? Chamo de discurso do bandido. Separei algumas frases maravilhosas deste livro. Ironia, claro. “Já percebeste que, às vezes, quando te importas menos com alguma coisa, acaba por correr melhor? Já notaste que geralmente é a pessoa menos empenhada que acaba se dando bem? Já reparaste que às vezes, quando paras de te importar tanto, tudo começa a entrar nos eixos?” Esta é a melhor. Claro que a pessoa menos empenhada tem mais sucesso. Não é Mark, seu lindo? Tu sabes bem o que dizes, escreveste um livro medíocre e vendes imenso. Palmas, quem diz a verdade não merce castigo. “Se buscar o positivo é negativo, então buscar o negativo gera o positivo.” Obviamente que quando somos pessimistas vamos encontrar as energias positivas. Como o Bukowski. Ele adorava ser velho, bêbado e pobre. Então esforçava-se imenso para continuar a ser assim só na esperança de vender muitos livros e ficar rico. Quem sabe o primeiro do euromilhões para tanta negatividade. “O problema das pessoas que se agarram a qualquer banalidade como se daquilo dependesse sua maldita vida é que elas não têm mais nada interessante com que se importar.”  Sim, claro. A senhora que ele dá como exemplo passa os dias a cortar talões de desconto.  E segundo o Mark ela faz isso porque não tem mais nada para de interessante. Até pode ser uma pessoa sozinha, deprimida, doente, mas não, vamos generalizar e dizer que ela não tem nada de interessante para fazer. Aliás, ele faz isso constantemente ao longo do livro. Eu resumo este livro. Não ligues muitos às coisas, tenta relaxar, enfrenta os teus medos e quanto mais negativo mais alcanças. Porque desta forma não estás sempre a tentar provar nada, nem a martelar a tua cabeça e ficares frustrado. Vais morrer, portanto não te preocupes muito, terás sucesso se mantiveres essa postura. Não ligues aos outros, eles não são um obstáculo. Só tens é de continuar a fazer aquilo que queres e dizer umas quantas asneiras pelo meio. Se fores arrogante, melhor ainda. Interessa é tentares manter a graça, cair na graça e se não caíres paciência. O livro está cheio de generalizações e exemplos muito ao jeito do autor. Tenta ser engraçado, mas eu dei longos suspiros de aborrecimento em vez de gargalhadas. Os mal-educados, sem papas na língua, nas tintas para tudo e todos nunca serão pessoas de sucesso. Tenho outra definição para isso. Não recomendo. Nada. "

64,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5759543-sam-quixote,Rating 3 out of 5,"Eye-catching title, eh? Unfortunately that’s about all that really stands out about Mark Manson’s The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck, which is actually a very ordinary self-help book - and I’ve not even read a lot of self-help books either, that’s how broad, generic and unremarkable a lot of the stuff he talks about here is! Still, its ideas are ultimately positive and worth re-reading and keeping in mind so I can’t say I found the book a total waste of time. The book’s title and main thesis can be summed up as: finding and caring about the shit that matters to you while ignoring the shit that doesn’t - see what I mean when I say it’s unremarkable? But wait, there’s more! Manson has more vapid platitudes like how life’s about the journey, not the destination, how finding meaning in life is better than accumulating material possessions, and that, seeing as we’re all going to die one day, why waste our limited time on shit that doesn’t matter? Not that I disagree with any of that but there’s nothing new or special about that information and you definitely don’t need to read this book to hear that kind of stuff. In fact, you don’t even need to read it anywhere at all as these ideas are so ubiquitous in pop culture as to be cliched! But, like I said, the book also contains useful messages that are worth hearing whether or not you’ve come across them before. Messages like pain and struggle are necessary and unavoidable parts of life. That rising up to challenges and facing hard truths about ourselves help us grow as well as make us stronger at weathering the shit life inevitably throws our way. That failure - so long as we learn from it - eventually leads to success so we shouldn’t be afraid to keep trying even if we’ll probably fail. That dissatisfaction and being uncomfortable are good as they motivate us to change and improve ourselves and our circumstances. I agree that perspective and values are important and that adjusting these can lead to a more satisfying existence. This means accepting that you’ll probably never be rich and famous, that you’re probably not an undiscovered genius or great artist, or that anything you’ll ever do will have any lasting impact on future generations. And that realisation can be freeing to pursue the things that only matter to you.As Manson notes, nothing is certain, which is a profoundly obvious yet difficult lesson I’m slowly learning and re-learning all the time. We also have a tendency to create our own narratives that are confining and are worth exploding as they’re largely bullshit. And I totally agree with and can personally attest that taking more responsibility in your life leads to far greater happiness. Jocko Willink has a similar philosophy: Discipline Equals Freedom. But I don’t buy Manson’s anecdote that when he googled the quote “With great power comes great responsibility” he couldn’t find out who originally said it. As a comics reader, I instantly know it was Spider-Man’s Uncle Ben but I can’t believe a Google search wouldn’t tell him that! He’s right though when he says that excessive freedoms don’t lead to happiness. You only need to look at the toxic Social Justice movement currently poisoning Western politics whose adherents are obsessed with personal freedoms - none of those people are ever happy! His points on the importance of boundaries in relationships and healthy conflict stemming from honesty though were banal and unnecessary. I’m a terrible procrastinator so I really liked the “Do Something” principle where you just do whatever it is you should be doing rather than waiting for the “right moment” or inspiration to strike. The idea is that once you start doing something, especially badly, you’ll eventually start doing it right. Action leads to motivation leads to inspiration leads to success - basically a practical application of not being afraid of failure and one I’ll be trying out myself. I wasn’t that interested in Manson’s autobiographical anecdotes, which were mostly mundane, nor did I find a lot of the examples he chose to illustrate his ideas to be that compelling, though I do like the possibility that Shakespeare wrote Romeo & Juliet as a satire on love especially as so many view it as the ultimate romance story! I also don’t agree that caring less about something means you’ll do better at it or that great people become great because they don’t think they’re great which is why they work harder than most. Both are, like a lot of the statements he makes, an oversimplified generalisation. Maybe he’s right for some but maybe some others already think they’re great and are driven by something else? And, like all self-help books, it needs to be vague enough to be a one-size fits all for the widest possible appeal so I’m not sure how helpful it’s going to be in finding its audience’s meaning in their individual lives - it certainly didn’t mine! But on the whole Manson is a decent writer who’s able to put his ideas across quite clearly in an accessible way. The messaging may be fairly commonplace and underwhelming but I found enough good stuff here to have gotten something out of reading it and if you’ve read no self-help books at all you might find this even more useful! The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck is kinda worth giving a fuck about, just don’t expect much from it. "

The things mentioned in the book are logical and make immense sense, they're also presented with interesting and sometimes personal issues to get the idea. Manson's writing is straight to the point and natural; it flows like a conversation rather than a self-help rant. All this, and I still couldn't find much enthusiasm for the things being said because I find them to be basic things that I've always believed. It did give me a few things to consider and maybe look up, but I don't get why people keep telling me that it's ""life changing."""

Mark Manson is a successful blogger, and began his digital career with a dating advice site, which he then turned into a blog, the blog attracted a lot of readers, and...voilà, NY Times bestselling author. The strong point of his book should have been the counterintuitive approach ( as he writes in the subtitle). Though all of Manson's advice is contrary to those in the self-help literature. Here, you will find neither "" be happy "", nor "" realize that you are extraordinary "", but rather "" take care of your own business "", and "" we cannot all be extraordinary, by definition, most of us are mediocre "". The book begins with Charles Bukovski's story, and Manson takes his last piece of advice "" Don't try "". Then, he goes on, illustrating with personal psychological studies, to "" deceive yourself "" - ( this is my favorite, in fact, I've always been a fan of questioning beliefs), - "" look for the pain and make friends with it "", ( here I refrain..), and so on.  I always avoid giving examples of stories that I liked from a book, because I don't like to give spoilers, but this time, I will tell here one story from Manson's book, I think my passion for music was a deciding factor... Here is the story : In '83, a talented guitarist was fired from his band, at the worst possible time, they had just signed a contract to record an album. The initial shock quickly turned to anger, and the young artist vowed to take revenge as he knows best : to make another band, to have a crazy success, and, especially, to make his former colleagues bite their nails of envy.. It seems that anger is a good incentive, because everything went well : in just two years, he signed his first contract, and the resulting album became a gold record.  The young musician is Dave Mustaine, and his band is the legendary Megadeth.  Only one thing did not work out for Mustaine : that much-desired envy of former colleagues. The band that kicked him out was Metallica, the biggest rock band of all time ( it's my text, so I do what rankings I want ). Despite his enormous success, Mustaine said he still considers himself a loser, and that - says Manson - is happening for that Mustaine chose to measure his life and success not by the number of fans or albums sold, but by the only measurement that did not come out : "" How much better am I than Metallica ? "". And Manson explains that the way we self-evaluate our lives is not a result of destiny, but is entirely under our control.  A few days ago, ,( I hadn't finished the book), I told to a friend about this book. He replied that, from the title, he understood that it is a book about how not to care, in the buddhist style.  Well, no. I'II borrow a little Manson's vocabulary, for to clarify : The book actually says not to care about all sorts of nonsense, but to choose carefully the important things you really deserve to care about. Here, I have another restraint, though... Who can say what comes first, and what doesn't, in everyone's life ? I will end with a slightly more cryptic quote, this time quite close to buddhism, the explanation of which you will be glad to find in Manson's book : "" Wanting positive experiences is a negative experience . Accepting negative experiences is a positive experience. """
68,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12800930-bharath,Rating 4 out of 5,"After having read considerable number of self-help books, I am now at a stage where when I pick-up a self-help book, I hope I can run into new concepts which can surprise me. I find myself deriving useful advice from mindfulness practice, mythology and neuroscience these days rather than the classical self-help category of books. Did this book surprise me? – the early part of it did, it came across as frank and steered clear of regurgitating or inventing pretentious concepts.This book starts off well – warning in a subtle way to be wary of jargons which have become mainstream but serve no useful purpose. A good example is how everybody is destined for greatness which in the corporate world is used as a motivation tool. There is this undercurrent in such messages that you are largely inadequate the way you are. Another warning he offers is that if you feel the need to constantly affirm something, you are only artificially masking insecurities temporarily. A lot of the advice – on finding purpose, noticing things which bring you lasting happiness, curbing the constant urge to seek affirmation from others, slowing down etc is sensible. After some time though, as the book enters the mid-sections, it feels as if it has run out of new material to offer. Since the book is more pragmatic and less pretentious than most self-help literature, I do recommend it. The major drawback though is that it has less action-oriented advice – though it quotes mindfulness teachings, it does not go deep enough. My rating: 3.5 / 5."
69,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3643764-esil,Rating 4 out of 5,"3.5 starsI’m not sure what possessed me to listen to this audiobook. I have ZERO interest in self help books. But once I started, I thought it was good enough to keep going.The title is there for shock value, but it’s not a particularly shocking book, unless you’re easily put off by swearing. The author is not really advocating that we all drop everything and run to the beach. He’s arguing for recalibrating what matters to you, and acting on it.The secondary title - “a counterintuitive approach to living a good life” - is deceptive. There’s nothing counterintuitive here. There’s a lot of common sense. But it’s pretty good common sense. And also timely in many ways. So I didn’t have any aha moments, but I nodded my head a fair bit.The question that kept buzzing at the back of my mind is how likely people are to be able to make dramatic changes in their lives by being told to shift the focus on what matters to them. In other words, easier said than done. But still worth thinking about every now and then.I think I’ll stick to my ZERO self help books policy, but this wasn’t a bad foray out of my usual comfort zones."
70,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30279227-ts-chan,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5 stars.I don't usually reach for self-help books. However, the title of this book piqued my curiosity and it perpetually appears on the main page of Audible as a best seller, thus furthering my interest to pick it up. As an audiobook, I did enjoy this quite a fair bit as the narrator was good and brought life to the narrative. Admittedly, the advice contained herein was not ground-breaking, but delivered in a refreshing and humourous manner. It served as a reminder as to what we probably already know in the deep, dark recesses of our minds, but are too caught up in the hectic modern life and excesses for greater inner reflection. I find a few of the real-life examples quoted to be quite relevant and effective.

Who you are is defined by what you're willing to struggle for.

The title is slightly misleading as the book is not so much as to how not to give a f*ck but to choose what is important enough to give a f*ck about. It is about getting our priorities and values right so that we pick the right battles which truly matter in making our lives count for something. If we start giving a f*ck about every little thing, we will end up spending too much energy on trivial matters and being generally uncontented about life. While it is fine not to feel positive all the time, learning how to channel that in the right direction and taking charge of your life where it is possible to make a difference are the essential messages the book is getting across to the reader. The one theme that was discussed which I feel very strongly about was concerning the 'sense of entitlement' and how this can be destructive in the way one views his or her life. And social media is probably the biggest culprit in propagating this negative view to a whole new level. Being constantly bombarded with reality shows, Instagrams and blogs of beautiful people enjoying a beautiful life, we start to ask ""Why can't I be like so-and-so?"" or ""Why can't I have this or that too?"". As a 14-year old niece of mine rightly pointed out, Instagram represents filtered existence. It seems almost natural now for most to block out the unfavourable or darker segments of life or humanity - such as poverty, hunger, war, violence, human trafficking, prostitution, etc. Instead, we moan and groan about the 'unfortunate circumstances' of not being able to own nice cars and big houses, have great clothes and the requisite body to go with it, go on expensive holidays, or obtain that 'much-deserved' promotion at work - the list goes on and on.Anyway, I'm rambling - this is a topic that I can go on and on about, but that's not the point about this review. If you're curious, this is worth a read as it is quite funny and does not take up much time to finish. Even though much of what is said was nothing new, sometimes we just need that extra nudge.This review can also be found at Booknest"

But as I recently feel obliged to write a review about every single book that I read, thus it seemed inevitable to write it sooner or later. So here we go. Fasten your seat belt!If you have ever heard of Charles Bukowski, Buddha, Hiroo Onoda, Norio Suzuki, Dave Mustaine, Pete Best, William James, Malala Yousafzai, Meredith Maran, Pablo Picasso, Romeo & Juliet, Ernest Becker, then trust me, you will learn their stories again in a very different way that will seize your mind and leave you completely astonished.This book will help you know why all the other self-development books didn't help you or anyone else through the principle of the Feedback Loop from Hell.It will tell you why we are always searching for the happiness and what should the true happiness be from everyone's own perspective.Moreover it will accuse you, and me, of overrating certain life aspects. You will also get to meet the Disappointment Panda and figure out how would you deal with him.You will learn by yourself how everyone is given to choose their own struggles.You will know that it is not a must to me the superhero and the very special person in that exaggerating behavior, in a matter of fact, thus everyone should be one! Nevertheless not lowering or diminishing the value of being one!It will tear you apart while knowing the value of suffering, the shitty values and great values through The Self-Awarness Onion.Furthermore, it will condemn you of your responsibilities and all the freedom of choice you have. It will hit you on the head by letting you ask yourself: ""What if I am wrong about everything?"" Last but not least, It will grab you by the arm to know that failure, pain and rejection are part of the process by getting to know the Do Something principle.
This book is about everything in your life. It isn't limited to career topics or relationship styling. But rather to a higher and more intellectual state of mind and reason. This book is for you!This book is not rocket science, it doesn't inform us of new matters that were unknown to us. Rather it tells you exactly what you already know, what is standing right in front of your nose, down in simple, friendly, invasive words that will leave you seeing things much more different than before.I have made it across a lot of various books, but this book is surely different. I believe this book was the hit on the head that I urgely needed to wake up and sort things out differently and to view all my priorities and values with an entirely conscious mind. And to put all my life, past and future, into question!This book will drive you to get hurt facing the inevitable truth, will make you show up your deepest wounds, will leave you in anger, rage and tears depending on what you have encountered in life and the VALUES you are living by.P.S. If you are rigid follower of my reviews you will understand why I underlined the word VALUES and why this book is a so life changing experience to me. As I hope it would be to you too."

You have to confront it and accept it.2)	Life is not pursuing pleasure. Find something FUCKWORTHY to give a fuck about.3)	You are not the best and probably you are not going to be one.4)	You are going to die and no one would give a fuck.کتاب می‌خواد بگه هر چی بیشتر به این موارد توجه کنی، احتمال اینکه به یک جایی برسی بیشتره. کل حرف کتاب رو اگر خودم بخوام خلاصه کنم این می‌شه که ""در جنگ با زندگی نمی‌تونی برنده بشی. ذهنت رو از ایده پیروز شدن خالی کن و اونوقت ممکنه به یک جایی برسی."" اوایل کتاب رو واقعا دوست داشتم. ولی به تدریج که جلو میره تکراری می‌شه و از تازگی میوفته. اما سر جمع قابل قبول بود. از محورهای اصلی کتاب که بگذریم اما یک سری صحبت‌ها و قصه‌ها و داستان‌های فرعی هم تو کتاب هست که اتفاقا عمده اون‌ها حول محور زندگی شخصی خود نویسنده و تجربیاتش هستن و با اینکه بنده خدا داره خودش همه چی رو اعتراف می‌کنه، اما باید اذعان کنم که نویسنده کتاب ما، آدم خوش‌شانسی بوده که تو یک خانواده ثروتمند در آمریکا به دنیا اومده. هیچ وقت به معنی واقعی در اضطراب مسائل مالی نبوده و در ایام نوجوانی و جوانی تونسته یک زندگی پر از ریخت‌وپاش داشته باشه.

Το χω ξαναπεί και σε παλιότερες κριτικές μου όσο αφορά τα βιβλία αυτοβελτίωσης ότι είναι πολύ σχετικό το ποιο είναι καλό και ποιο όχι και ποιο θα καταφέρει λίγο με το περιεχόμενο του να βοηθήσει στη σκέψη μας και στους προβληματισμούς μας. Το συγκεκριμένο βιβλίο το διάβασα πάρα πολύ ευχάριστα από την πρώτη κιολας σελίδα και αν κάτι εκτίμησα σε αυτό εκτός από την απλότητα της γραφής του είναι ότι ο συγγραφέας του σε κανένα σημείο του δεν αναλώθηκε να μας πείσει ότι όλα στη ζωή είναι τέλεια αρκεί να τα δεις έτσι, δεν μας γέμισε με εγχειρίδια πώς να κάνετε αυτό, γιατί να είστε έτσι κτλ.

He is just a normal person without all that Botox and designer jeans that made his butt look bigger telling me he has many things HE has to work on a daily basis and what he had to overcome to not be a piece of shit psycho. I had to return the book to its rightful owner so I can't pick out my favorite quotes (and I'm not buying it for $30) but this book is very quotable and very raw.I have always known I am a people pleaser and I really hate that trait about me because I put myself in awkward positions and then resent the person I want to help because 1. They weren't grateful enough 2. They will never ever return the favor 3. They turned out to be shitty people. 4. I am just annoyed!So yes, it okay to say NO to people. I don't have to care about every little cause and I should definitely have my priorities straight. Stop being fake and surround yourself with people that are meaningful to you. Just do and see what happens from there. You are not unique and your problems are not unique so once you realize this you can just live your life without that carrot dangling over your sleep. With failure you learn about who you are and can grow as a person. Just because you failed at something doesn't mean you are a failure. Social media life is fake so you are not pathetic for not eating at Spago for lunch or being in the Caribbean this year. Be true to the person you want to be.

I wouldn’t normally reach for a self help book, but Mark Moran’s The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life, was the pick for our book club this month. It also formed part of challenge read on 'read a self help guide' I have going with a fellow bookworm. I decided to give this book a chance and I went into reading it with an open mind, despite my reservations about the bold title. I surprised myself by enjoying this book. I found it a highly readable, direct, humorous and relatable guide. I wouldn’t say this is a self help book as such, but more a strategy in self evaluation. Many of the ideas and approaches Moran suggests we should take to change our lives are simple to implement and most probably have in the back of our minds – yet Moran suggest what we lack is courage to act on this. What Moran does is put these ideas in spotlight and his book works to give the reader the encouragement needed to put his notions into practice. What I appreciated the most about The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck was insertion of real life stories within this text. Moran linked his approaches to concrete scenarios, which gave his guide much more brevity. From the author Moran’s own back story from hitting rock bottom to becoming a blogger extraordinaire, to celebrity examples such as former Beatles drummer Pete Best and even World War II survivours - the message is clear in all cases. What almost breaks you may in fact make you a stronger, happier and better person. "
85,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6257531-caroline,Rating 3 out of 5,"An interesting read, but afterwards I felt a bit less-than.  I decided this was because Manson has been supersonically successful in nearly everything he has attempted in life, whereas I am very ordinary. In fact he sings the praises of being ordinary - but even so, it's from a supersonically successful perspective. The two things that I particularly enjoyed about the book were firstly his brief but wonderful description of Buddha's life, and how he came to form the ideas that he did.    Secondly I thoroughly enjoyed his discussion about values, and how holding good values and trying to adhere to them can have a great impact on our lives. Other points the book touches upon:* The helpfulness of failure, if we treat these experiences as opportunities to learn from our mistakes. * The inevitably of suffering - even the joy in our lives can be immensely challenging at times (e.g. starting your own business, raising children etc.) *Taking responsibility for what happens in our lives.  (He celebrates an inner locus of control.)  Even if a crisis happens that has nothing to do with us, we are responsible for how we act afterwards.* The importance of acknowledging our inevitable ignorance and propensity to make mistakes.* Accepting rejection (it's fine if you say ""No"" and it's fine if other people say ""No"". )  * Finally, recognising that life is finite & we die.I found his writing style a bit overbearing,which wasn't helped by the never-ending barrage of expletives.    However, I'm glad I read the book.   The good bits were very good.I shall end with my usual clutter of notes for my own reference. 
 				BOUNDARIESPeople in healthy relationships with strong boundaries will take responsibility for their own values and problems. People in a toxic relationship with poor or no boundaries will regularly avoid responsibility for their own problems and/or take responsibility for their partner's problems. It's okay to CHOOSE to support or be supported by your partner, but it's not good when you feel obliged or entitled.People with strong boundaries are not afraid of a temper tantrum, an argument or getting hurt. People with weak boundaries are terrified of these things.EMOTIONS:It's good to question them. Some people over-identify with their emotions. Everything is justified for no other reason than they felt it. We need reason as well as emotion. Two extremes.....Repressed emotions versus over-identifying with emotions (where there is no reasoning.) Emotions never last. What makes us happy today won't make us happy tomorrow.The first level of self-awareness is to become aware of emotional blind spots.The second level of self awareness is to ask WHY we feel an emotion eg WHY do I feel angry? etc.EMOTIONS- Negative emotions.The truth is that life sometimes sucks and the healthiest thing you can do is admit it. Denying negative emotions leads to more prolonged negative emotions, and to emotional dysfunction. Things go wrong,people upset us, and accidents happen. When we feel these emotions we need to a)Express them in a socially acceptable and healthy manner. B)Express them in a way that aligns with our values. Psychological pain is an indicator of something out of equilibrium. Experiencing this pain can be healthy - eg the emotional pain of rejection or failure teaches us to avoid making the same mistake in the future.ENTITLEMENT Entitlement means that people feel deserving of good things without actually earning them. Entitled people can emit a delusional level of self-confidence and this can be alluring and even spread to other people. A person who has real self-worth is able to look frankly at the negative parts of his character, and then act on improving them.Entitlement/narcissism flip between....I'm awesome and the rest of you suck, so I deserve special treatment. I suck and the rest of you are awesome, so I deserve special treatment.Psychologist Rory Baumeister began researching the concept of evil in the 1990's. Before that we assumed that people who did horrible things did so because the felt bad about themselves, but often this was not true. In fact it was usually the opposite. Some of the worst criminals feel pretty good about themselves. They feel an unwavering certainty in their own righteousness, and in their own beliefs. Racists believe in their genetic superiority, religious fanatics are certain of their place in heaven. Rapists and abusers believe they're entitled to women' bodies. Evil people never believe that they are evil, rather they believe that others are evil.Our current technology seems to allow our insecurities to run amok like never before. We are more entitled than we used to be. Being average has become the new standard 'failure'. We all expect to be extraordinary. We want to be special and deserve attentions. In fact people who do become extraordinary just know they are ordinary and have to work hard. It is far better to accept that you are ordinary and we don't matter much in the grand scheme of things. You will no longer feel you always have to prove yourself and the stress of feeling inadequate should go. You will get a growing appreciation of life's basic experiences. The ordinary is what actually matters.FAILURE If someone is better than you at something, then it's likely because she has failed at it more than you have. If someone is worse than you,it's likely he or she hasn't been through all of the painful learning experiences that you have. HAPPINESSHappiness requires struggle. It grows from problems. It is earned through choosing and managing our struggles. To have a good body you need to exercise and watch your eating. To start a business you need to negotiate risk, uncertainty and repeated failures - plus insane work hours. A lot of the most meaningful and joyous things we can do can be stressful, arduous and unpleasant at times - eg raising children or running your own business .We may have to withstand problem after problem. We may even feel pain and despair - but these things can be hugely worthwhile. One day, in retrospect, the years of struggle will strike you as the most beautiful. (Sigmund Freud)Happiness comes from solving problems - although we always have problems. We need to try and have good problems rather than bad problems - like the stress of working out at the gym versus the stress of lying around and doing no exercise. Happiness is a constant work in progress because solving problems is a constant work in progress. Problems never stop, they merely get exchanged or upgraded. Solving problems makes us happy, this even applies to really tough problems like how to get on with your mother in law. Everything has inherent stresses. The house you buy needs repairs. The person you marry is the person you argue with. The dream job is the job you stress over. What makes us feel good makes us feel bad. HIGHS: These are shallow and unproductive: eg alcohol, moral righteousness (from blaming someone else), or the thrill of a risky new adventure. Highs can generate addiction. PROBLEMS:Things that stop us solving problems:1.Denial you have a problem.2)Having a victim mentality - where you blame others or outside circumstances, and feel anger, helplessness and despair, and believe you cannot solve your problems. Solving problems can be very hard.RESPONSIBILITYEven if we're not responsible for an awful event, we are responsible regarding how we react and behave afterwards.SUFFERING:Life itself is a form of suffering, whatever your situation. Some suffering is certainly more painful than others, but we all must suffer nonetheless. Dissatisfaction and unease are inherent parts of human nature and necessary components to creating consisten thappiness. Psychological pain is an indicator of something out of equilibrium.VALUESWe need to reserve our concern for what really matters, eg someone passionate about coupons for getting shop discounts - what a waste of values. We mustn't worry about trivial things, instead we need to worry about things that matter. Being concerned about something can be really trivial - like a kid crying because his hat is blue, but when we mature hopefully we become more selective about what we care about. A major level of self awareness is to question our values. eg Why do I feel a need to be rich and successful? (Or whatever....) The author illustrates this with how he came to accept he would never have a close and loving relationship with his brother, but they do have a relationship of mutual trust and respect - and that is good enough, even if not what he would prefer. It doesn't matter that society tells us that families should be really close. What is objectively true about a situation (eg families are close/blood is thicker than water etc.) is not as important as how you come to see the situation, how you choose to measure failure.Our values determine the metrics by which we measure ourselves and everyone else.If you want to change how you see your problems, you have to change what you value and/or how you measure failure/success.Pete Best got kicked out of The Beatles. At first he was suicidal, butlater he changed his values and said he felt hugely contented with his wife and children. He ended up saying he was glad he was kicked out.Dave Mustaire, a brilliant and influential musician, still measures himself against the fact that decades ago he was kicked out of the band Metallica. He adopted ""success relative to Metalloica""as the metric by which to measure himself and his music career. Despite his huge success he regards himself as a failure. VALUES:Bad values1)Pleasure - in extreme pleasures become addictions.2)Material success3)Always being right - This stops you learning from your mistakes. We constantly make poor assumptions, misjudge probabilities,mis-remember facts, or given in to cognitive biases and make decisions based on emotional whims. It is far better to consider yourself as largely ignorant.VALUESThe 5 counter-intuitive values that I believe are the most beneficial values you can adopt.1.Taking responsibility of everything that occurs in your life,regardless of who's at fault.2.Uncertainty. Acknowledging your own ignorance - and the cultivation of constant doubt in your own beliefs. Uncertainty is at the root of all progress and growth.3.Failure. The willingness to discovery your own flaws and mistakes,so they may be improved upon.4.Rejection. The ability to both say and hear ""No"". Thus clearly defining what you will and won't accept in your life.5. Contemplation of your own morality. Death helps us keep our othervalues in perspective.VICTIMHOOD: Seeing yourself as constantly victimised requires just as much selfishness as the opposite. It takes just as much energy and delusional self-aggrandisement to maintain the belief you have insurmountable problems as the belief you have no problems at all. Lots of people (often people you know) will have similar problems. You aren't special.WORKIt's no good fantasising about being a rock star unless you are prepared to go through the pain of practice, finding gigs, enduring failure etc. All of the above just shows that if you don't do these things you just don't want it enough. You are defined by what you're willing to struggle for. You need to be one of those people who enjoys the hard work and stresses which are part of any endeavour - then you will succeed.My math teacher Mr Packwood used to say ""If you're stuck on a problem don't sit there and think about it, just start working on it. Even if you don't know what you're doing, the simple act of work on it will eventually cause the right ideas to show up in your head. Perhaps the most important thing I learnt in my life is ""Action isn't just the effect of motivation;it's also the cause of it. We need to follow the ""do something"" principle. We need to feel free to fail, and that failure moves us forward. Doing something should be your only metric for success.

Mark Manson really speaks the truth and talks about important issues that are part of our lives.

We easily fall into routine and complain about it, but not everyone is willing to break the cycle. I think I need to read this book every year.„Don’t just sit there. Do something.

f*cking
 hate this type of book. I'm contemplating writing a counter-book, purely to call out this type of ""literature"" and the phoney authors that write it. I'll call it: ""Just F*ck Off"", or something similar. These types of books are all the same. No real f*cking content, no actual f*cking thought, and not a trace of f*cking originality. Let me quickly run down how it works:Chapter begins. The author highlights a theme of some sort, then continues to pluck an example or quote out of the air which the author has heard of or read somewhere (the Yoda quote on page 113 is incorrect, by the way). The author knows nothing further about this topic other than their brief discovery of the fact/event/example - but that doesn't matter, as it is usually reasonably interesting and they think that it fits in nicely with their train of thought. They then bring this round to talk about themselves; how they can relate to this in some way; what skewed lessons can be learnt from this, and so on. Finally, finishing with a brief lecture on why there's something wrong with you/us/society, and they have/are the answer. Repeat.Who are you, Mark Manson? What deep insight have you managed to achieve in your brief time on this planet that is going to change my life by casting judgement and dictating your thoughts on it? You are the epitome of the 21st-century problem - a reeking aura of smugness who thinks that they're God's gift and has a message that must be heard. You even quote in the book: ""People declare themselves experts, entrepreneurs, inventors, innovators, mavericks, and coaches without any real-life experience."" Surely... Surely, you see the irony here? I'm annoyed at myself for even bothering to give this book a chance. I had to force myself through the drivel until its end. If I could give it zero stars, then I

Και συζητάτε, συζητάτε, συζητάτε για τα πάντα, κάνοντας αυτοκριτική, αναγνωρίζοντας λάθη και αιτίες, προσπαθώντας να βρείτε λύσεις που ξέρετε ότι δεν πρόκειται να εφαρμόσετε ποτέ. Όλα αυτά διατυπώνονται άλλοτε με έξυπνα επιχειρήματα και άλλοτε με προχειρότητα, αμέτρητες αυτοαναιρέσεις και γενικεύσεις καθώς και πολλές βλακείες, χιούμορ και αυτοσαρκασμό για να μη το βαραίνουμε πολύ.Οι προβληματισμοί του βιβλίου αυτού είναι επικεντρωμένοι σε ένα συγκεκριμένο θέμα μεν, το επίπεδο τους όμως είναι ανάλογο μιας τέτοιας συζήτησης, δηλαδή με λίγη κριτική σκέψη καταλαβαίνεις πόσο λαϊκοί είναι, πόσο μάλλον όταν ήδη στην αρχή του βιβλίου υπάρχει μια μεγάλη αντίφαση. Το λαϊκό ομως προσωπικά δεν το υποτιμώ καθόλου, γιατί μια επίδραση έστω και παροδική την έχει, κι αυτό δεν το θεωρώ καθόλου ασήμαντο. Επίσης δεν με ενοχλεί εφόσον ο συγγραφέας έχει αυτογνωσία ως προς αυτό, την εξωτερικεύει στον αναγνώστη και δεν γίνεται το βιβλίο λαϊκίστικο και φτηνιάρικο, ούτε βάζει ανθρώπους να γράψουν εκατό φορές τη λέξη αξίζω σε ένα χαρτί για να κερδίσουν 500 κιλά αυτοπεποίθηση μέσα σε 15 ημέρες. Το μόνο που με ενόχλησε ήταν κάτι εξυπνάδες που πέταγε για τσαχπινιά, κλασσικές αμερικανιές (δεν μπορώ να το προσδιορίσω αλλιώς, αν το διαβάσετε θα καταλάβετε) και το γεγονός ότι όπως σε όλα τα βιβλία του είδους, από ένα σημείο και μετά αρχίζει να επαναλαμβάνεται. Αλλά εντάξει, ήξερα ότι επέλεξα να διαβάσω το βιβλίο ενός Αμερικανού blogger και όχι κάποιου ειδικού (αν και με την ίδια αμφισβήτηση αντιμετωπίζω τον οποιονδήποτε).Η ευγενής τέχνη του να τα γράφεις όλα στα...!(προσθέστε ότι σας αρέσει, εγώ προτιμώ την κλασσική επιλογή), ουσιαστικά εχει να κάνει με τη σημασία της προτεραιότητας στη καθημερινή ζωή. Τι θεωρούμε σημαντικό και τι όχι, για ποιά πράγματα χολοσκάμε και για πια αδιαφορούμε (ή μήπως σκάμε για όλα;), τι σχέση έχουν όλα αυτά με την ωριμότητα, τι ρόλο παίζουν οι προσωπικές μας αξίες στο τρόπο που αντιλαμβανόμαστε τη πραγματικότητα και πόσο λανθασμένες και επιβλαβείς μπορεί είναι είναι κάποιες από αυτές οι αξίες.Αν ήμουν δεκαετίες μεγαλύτερη δεν ξέρω κατά πόσο θα μου άρεσε, το συμπέρασμα μου όμως για αυτό το βιβλίο είναι πως είναι ταπεινό αλλά τίμιο, καλύτερο από κάποια μπουρδολογήματα και χειρότερο από πιο εμπεριστατωμένα επιστημονικά έργα. Αξιοπρεπές, εμψυχωτικό και φρέσκο ανάγνωσμα, ότι πρέπει για τους καλοκαιρινούς καύσωνες. ❣"

The bright orange cover and the provocative F*ck word in the title. I am sure this triumph of marketing would have caught the eye of more passers-by than if it had a plain white cover and was called “How to Survive in the Modern World” – or the like. The author is a blogger, a successful one at that apparently.I found this to be an ordinary read. Sure, there were some honourable mentions such as, “you can’t control the external world and you’re best taking control of your own emotions, values and goals”, nothing new there. One main theme was reducing the number of things we all need to “give a F*ck” about. Okay, apart from the F-Bomb, that’s a standard message, but to be fair, when I read this bit I did then sit and think about some of the things I could and should stop caring or worrying about. So there was the occasional moment that stirred some self-reflection.The overall style is a bit blokey and a bit too smart for me. The general theme seems to be “shit happens and get over it”. The author spent considerable time providing anecdotes from his life and how he seems to have overcome them. Okay, that’s good for him, but I fear this book would be of no use to people suffering from mental illnesses – and this type of book could make such people worse. It seems this book is aimed at the younger demographic market, I couldn’t imagine anybody with considerable life experience extracting much from this work. However, I suppose this is a matter for the individual.The use of the word “F*ck” is liberal to say the least, doesn’t really bother me – but it could bother others, and when overused like this it does lose some impact. Average book, I was happy to finish it and glad to finish this review.2 Stars"

“you will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of”
— overall thoughts: 4.0 — An accessible self-help book that anyone can benefit fromThat was honestly one of the best thing's I've ever read. I just need to say that my notes for this review is 4 screens of my phone long but I'm still not sure if I'll be able to string the right words together to make a comprehensive review without outright ranting. There are just too many messages placed in this crash course of a book, but I guess that's what made it amazing for me. Anyway :) ....the overall message of this book is basically to place your attention on the most true, immediate and important parts of your life.... and something about that just made me feel like a happy little tree 🌲the fact that it wasn't SO serious 100% of the time made me comfortable?? and since I read this as an audiobook it literally felt like a friend was talking to me the whole time. Like my bestfriend giving me advice. It made me open up my mind more, which I think was the point.I can't formulate paragraphs right now so here's a bulleted form of some of what translated into my head:● avoidance in itself is a struggle -> so just solve problems that you enjoy● no one who is actually happy has to convince themselves that they are happy● who you are = what you are willing to struggle for● admit that life just sucks sometimes● EMOTIONS are just FEEDBACK -> you're allowed to be angry at someone but it doesn't justify you punching them ● blaming others hurts you the most
“nobody makes it through life without collecting a few scars on the way out”
some of the most life-changing choices that we are going to be given is simple but it's going be really really hard to choose that. As a service-oriented person (even though they were probably talking about something else) I kind of associated myself with that part saying ""acts of love are only valid if they are done without conditions or expectations"".I needed to hear these words so bad at the point in my life right now and it was just the right words to reassure me. And the words weren't so profound that you need to think so hard to get the message which allows for even a younger audience than the usual self-help book.I was able to relate to it a lot and reminded me that even though we are all different people leading different lives... we all struggle just the same. Acknowledging our mistakes means that we've grown past them.
“the last person I should ever have to censor myself with is the woman I love”
We choose what is enough for us. The book also said this somewhere but I feel like repeating here that it's just saying what we already know but making us face them and saying it straight up.I mean I didn't even think I really needed a self-help book right now so READ THIS!!At the end of the day we are already great people simply because we can CHOOSE what to give a f*** about.thanks for reading my somewhat unfiltered thoughtsFORMAT READ Audiobook (Recommended)READ FOR: accessible self-help book⟹ MY BLOG | SUPPORT ME ON KO-FI ⟸"
94,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55736191-alish,Rating 1 out of 5,"برای نوشتن درباره این کتاب نیاز به نوشتن یک مقدمه کلی دارمچه چیزی باعث میشه فردی کتاب خودیاری بنویسه؟ اگر از انگیزه اولیه که پشت بسیاری از تلاش‌های ما هست (پول) بگذریم، فرد احتمالا احساس میکنه که به روشی رسیده که تونسته باهاش زندگی خودش رو بهتر کنه و میخواد این روش رو با دیگران هم به اشتراک بذاره. اما انسان نمیتونه به سادگی نتیجه تجربیاتش رو به دیگران منتقل کنه، به خصوص وقتی که اصلا اونها رو ندیده، یعنی مخاطبان کتابش. پس کتاب خودیاری نوشتن باید کار سختی باشه. هر چند به نظر میاد که بسیاری از نویسندگان کتاب‌های خودیاری به خودشون زحمت ندادند که این کار سخت رو درست انجام بدند و نتیجه میشه این که کتاب‌های زرد زیادی در این ژانر داریم. ولی به هر صورت کتاب‌های خوبی هم داریم.پس نویسنده یک کتاب خودیاری باید ظرافت‌هایی رو در کارش رعایت کنه که بتونه کتاب خوبی بنویسه. یکی از این ظرافت‌ها اینه که از گفتن مسائل غیرواقعی و غلط یا حداقل مناقشه‌برانگیز اجتناب کنه. چون در این کتاب جای بحث درباره درست یا غلط بودن این مسائل نیست. نویسنده باید مسائلی رو به عنوان داده اولیه ابزار بحث یا تحلیلش قرار بده که واقعیت هستند یا چندان بر سرشون بحث نیست. رعایت این مسئله در یک رمان ضرورتی نداره، اما در یک کتاب خودیاری داره. ظرافت دیگری که باید رعایت شه اینه که از ساده‌سازی بیش از حد خودداری کنه. به عنوان مثال نگه علت فلان پدیده قطعا الف هست، در حالی که میدونیم ب و پ و ت هم میتونند علت باشند. ولی چون به اونچه که نویسنده میخواد بهش برسه نادیده گرفته شدند. ویژگی دیگه اینه که سعی کنه زبان خودش رو به مخاطب نزدیک کنه. با توجه به اینکه مخاطب رو نمیشناسه، میتونه لحنش رو صمیمانه و دوستانه کنه. اینطوری احتمالا میتونه با هر نوع مخاطبی ارتباط برقرار کنه. این هم نکته‌ای نیست که مثلا در رمان ضرورت داشته باشه. در یک کتاب دانشگاهی که قطعا نباید هم اینطور باشه. ولی در یک کتاب خودیاری لازمه. ویژگی دیگه اینه که مطالب منسجم باشند. پراکنده نباشند. کتاب خودیاری نباید مثل یه کشکول باشه که مطالب بدون نظم خاصی داخل کتاب ریخته شده باشند. یک ویژگی دیگه اینه که بحث نویسنده باید ��شخص و محدود باشه. قطعا ده‌ها جلد کتاب هم برای نظر دادن درباره همه جنبه‌های زندگی انسان کافی نیست. پس نویسنده یک کتاب خودیاری باید سعی کنه تا حد امکان درباره مطالب محدودی صحبت کنه. موارد دیگه‌ای هم میشه نام برد ولی ترجیح میدم از این طولانی‌ترش نکنم و به سراغ کتاب برم.این کتاب در همه مواردی که ذکر کردم نقص اساسی داره. مرتبا به مطالبی برمیخوریم که از سوی نویسنده به عنوان یه فکت مطرح شدند، اما در واقع یا کلا غلط هستند یا حداقل بر سر درست یا غلط بودن‌شون بحث هست. این رو میشه در کنار مورد دوم یعنی ساده‌سازی بیش از حد قرار داد چون در برخی موارد همراستا هستند. به عنوان مثال در فصل نخست، نویسنده مثالی از زنی میزنه که با یک فروشنده بر سر کوپن‌هاش دعوا میکنه. نویسنده از این رفتار نتیجه میگیره که اون زن وقت زیادی در روز بر سر این کوپن‌ها میذاره!!! چرا؟ معلوم نیست. این رو فکت میگیره و ازش برای تحلیل و رسیدن به منظور مورد نظرش استفاده میکنه. توضیح رفتار انسان برای نویسنده در طول کل کتاب به سادگی همین یک مورد مثاله.نویسنده برای نوشتن یک کتاب خودیاری اصلا قلم و لحن مناسبی نداره. در واقع یک آدم از خود متشکر و مغروره که مدام دلش میخواد داستان‌های بی سر و ته - و واقعا بی سر و ته - تعریف کنه، همواره خودش مرکز و محور داستان‌ها باشه، پز حاضرجوابی‌ها، تفریحات پرخرج و دوست‌دخترهای بسیارش در گذشته رو بده، نگاه از بالا به پایین به مخاطب داشته باشه و گاهی هم مخاطب رو حتی تحقیر کنه (به عنوان مثال یک جا به خواننده میگه ""نه احمق، فلان جوره""). از لحن دوستانه و صمیمانه داشتن، صرفا محاوره سخن گفتن رو بلد بوده. اما مشکل فقط در اینجا ختم نمیشه. فردی با این لحن و قلم دلش میخواد از هر دری هم براتون حرف بزنه. اصلا براش مهم نیست که داره حرفی رو میزنه که در فصل قبل دقیقا برخلاف اون رو گفته بود. اصلا هم براش اهمیتی نداره که اصلا در جایگاهی هست بتونه این حرف‌ها رو بزنه و افراد رو براساس معیارهای خودش قضاوت بکنه یا خیر. اصلا هم توجهی نمیکنه که عملا داره کل روانشناسی و فلسفه و علوم دیگه رو میریزه توی یه کاسه و میکس میکنه و در اخر یه ترکیبی که بی‌شباهت به ""سیرابی‌گلاسه"" نمیتونه باشه سر میز مخاطب میاره. گرچه نویسنده این رو به زبان نمیاره، اما به نظر میاد معتقده فلاسفه همه گوه زیادی خوردند و میشه فلسفه عشق و فلسفه مرگ رو در یک فصل خلاصه کرد و پرونده‌اش رو بست.اما الحق این کتاب یک ظرافت خیلی خاص داره: ظرافت در پوشاندن این نقص‌ها. نویسنده این ژست رو میگیره که قرار نیست با گفتن جملات قشنگ و دلپذیر برای خواننده اون رو شاد کنه، بلکه اتفاقا میخواد بزنه توی ذوقش و بگه خودت رو خاص ندون. با مشکلاتت روبرو شو و غیره. این روکشیه که به کل مطالب کتاب کشیده شده. در واقع اونچه که کتاب رو سرپا نگه داشته، القای حس ""من با بقیه کتاب‌های خودیاری فرق دارم"" به مخاطبه. وگرنه بعید بدونم کسی تا پیش از خوندن این کتاب نمیدونست که داشتن حد و مرزهای محکم خوبه یا اینکه چقدر خوب میشد که از مرگ نترسیم و به عنوان یک واقعیت زندگی بپذیریمش.در نهایت این کتابیه که باهاش روبرو هستیم. میدونم ریویوی من کاملا در جهت مخالف ریویوی بسیاری از دوستانه که امتیاز مثبتی به کتاب دادند و خب ... واقعا نمیدونم چرا ولی حیفم میومد که وقت نذارم و این ریویو رو ننویسم. نکته‌ای هم برام جالب و غیرقابل توضیح هست و اون اینه که بسیاری از ریویوهای فارسی کتاب مثبت هستند ولی بسیاری از ریویوهای انگلیسی کتاب منفی. حدس زدم شاید ترجمه فارسی تفاوت‌هایی با نسخه اصلی داره که کلا وایب متفاوتی رو به مخاطب داده ولی ریویوهای منفی رو که میخوندم دلایل‌مون برای نپسندیدن کتاب بسیار مشابه بود و خب من هم نسخه ترجمه شده رو خوندم. این هم برام جالب بود."

Não entendo como se pode “alterar” um título tão sugestivo e apelativo, substituindo um “o” por uma estrela ou um asterisco ou seja lá o que for.Mas lá o comprei…Ultimamente (talvez nos últimos dez anos) algumas pessoas minhas conhecidas dizem-me “tens um feitio de merda” (verdade, verdadinha, em sentido figurado) e outros dizem-me “és um egoísta do carvalho” (egoísta, sim, uma das minhas virtudes; mas do “carvalho”, pura mentira; porque sendo engenheiro agrícola de formação, sempre trabalhei na floresta, plantando mais eucaliptos (no quinto ano da Universidade dos Açores vendi-me rapidamente ao império de uma empresa multinacional sueca finlandesa – na altura Stora/Enso – em detrimento de um opção de Director de Golfe e Greenkeeper – com muito lazer e pouco trabalho), mas também, mais tarde, plantando muitos milhares de pinheiros bravos e mansos, e de sobreiros; e verdadeiramente pouquíssimos carvalhos – o que só confirma a inveracidade do termo quando dirigido e aplicado ao meu caso em particular. Por outro lado, as minhas amigas e os meus amigos – aqueles que me conhecem bem (Será que alguém me conhece? Será que alguém me conhece bem?) -, dizem-me que sou um homem cheio de virtudes e de atributos, sobretudo, nas questões culturais, de lazer e profissionais. Se no início o cinema dominava as minhas preferências – daí que a minha alcunha universitária fosse “João cineasta” e o visionamento de pelo menos três sessões contínuas no cinema Quarteto -, o que é um facto indesmentível e rapidamente o compreendi é que para assegurar o meu futuro profissional deveria trocar o consumo da película cinematográfica pelo consumo do papel. Daí a opção racional da referida troca – ler muito, ler cada vez mais. Assim como, também facilmente deduzo o número de árvores que alguns escritores deveriam plantar para compensar os excelentes livros que escrevem (neste caso, um menor número de árvores) e outros que seriam impelidos ou mesmo forçados a plantar (em número muito maior) de forma a compensar a desflorestação e os danos ambientais associados às suas fracas obras literárias.

98,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25605420-apoorva,Rating 3 out of 5,"‘The subtle art of not giving a fuck’ is not about not giving a fuck about anything at all but it’s about giving a fuck about what’s important and immediate in your life. After reading the index, I was sure I was going love it but it just didn’t live up to my expectations.I don’t think I found anything particularly life-changing, as it wasn’t anything I haven’t heard before. I get that the book was supposed to be realistic and all but it wasn’t that impressive to me. I came across some useful points and some points that I didn’t agree with. 
Takeaway
:•“The backward law”—the idea that the more you pursue feeling better all the time, the less satisfied you become, as pursuing something only reinforces the fact that you lack it in the first place.•We have to take responsibility for everything that happens in our life, even if it’s not our fault or something out of our control.•Who you are is defined by what you’re willing to struggle for. Managing our struggles leads to lifelong fulfillment and happiness. •Your actions actually don’t matter that much in the grand scheme of things; the vast majority of your life will be boring and not noteworthy, and that’s okay.•What is objectively true about your situation is not as important as how you come to see the situation, how you choose to measure it and value it.•Growth generates happiness, not a long list of arbitrary achievements.•Action isn’t just the effect of motivation; it’s also the cause of it.
Criticism
:The author gives an example of Charles Bukowski who got famous without trying. The chapter itself is named ‘Don’t try’ and he said that self-improvement and success aren’t the same things and all the conventional life advises i.e. the positive stuff is fixating on what you lack. Does this mean I should give up and accept myself the way I am if I know I can get better? Self-improvement might not guarantee success but it guarantees growth and progress, so I don’t think I’ll take this advice. I don’t believe in ‘Be who you are’, but ‘Be the best you can be’ which implies giving your 100% in everything.He says constant positivity is a form of avoidance, not a valid solution to life’s problems. While I agree it’s not a solution but it’s not a form of avoidance. I don’t think it’s possible for people to be positive all the time.But, being positive in a difficult situation is accepting that the situation is bad and approaching it effectively. Having a positive outlook enables you to cope better with stressful situations. It’s having the mindset that things are worse but they’re going to get better. Even I feel better and motivated when I’m thinking optimistically.He criticizes the positivity/consumer culture which tells us to be more accepting and open to possibilities and says that we need to reject things. He mentions the paradox of choice: the more options we’re given, the less satisfied we become with whatever we choose.Well, choosing something is essentially rejecting the alternatives and of course, we need to reject things but we need to know what we are rejecting and what’s good enough to commit to and we won’t know that unless we’re open to possibilities. Being open to possibilities is more about doing things out of your comfort zone. I don’t know who said it but found this quote: “To get something you have never had, you have to do something you’ve never done.” 
Conclusion
:Anyway, that was my interpretation and it was an ok read. It’d be perfect for people who don’t like the annoying positive self-help books; I’m one of those annoying positive people who find positivity uplifting.The author presented some points that are worth reading like the difference between healthy and unhealthy relationship, happiness, entitlement. I’d suggest you read and see for yourself if you like it."

For alternative reads without the swearing and vulgarity, I'd recommend Daring Greatly: How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead (my 5 star review here) and/or The Courage to be Disliked (my 4 star review here) I'm not a huge fan of swearing etc. myself but this was more about bluntness and simplicity rather than swearing for the sake of it so I didn't mind it quite so much. It's just honest and raw and is quite serious about making its point that no one and nothing is perfect.The point of this book is not to stop 'giving a f*ck', but to choose wisely the things you decide to care about. It raises the fairly common notion that true happiness is beyond the material, and caring about things you can't change (such as others' feelings) will do more harm than good. These ideas are something I definitely connect with, and I do think it's important to take responsibility for your own happiness. Yes, sometimes sh*tty things happen, but you have to find a way through the sh*t to ultimately become stronger, otherwise you're giving up happiness in favour of being a victim.The delivery is certainly not for everyone as there's no sympathy here, and the apathetic will be disappointed because instead of finding a common ideal this book hits with some hard truths. People who are offended easily will find plenty to be offended about, and it's easy to criticise the author for his sexist examples and analogies and the despicable behaviour of his past (which we only know because he has chosen to share). It starts with the message, 'don't try' and concludes with '...and then you die' and in between is a whole lot of 'you are not special', which honestly all sounds quite depressing but it really does make a lot of sense. It tells us we are not special, but then goes on to suggest why that might be so painful to hear. If you are open-minded, you'll understand and perhaps appreciate the wisdom in it; if you're more stubborn you'll close your eyes, cover your ears and repeat to yourself that you are special, no matter what this crappy little book says (thus increasing the pressure on yourself to be special). All in all, the book makes a lot of sense, but you have to be open and accepting enough to appreciate it.Side note: I was really surprised there were no references listed, considering how many names were dropped and psychology experiments referenced etc. Curious.If this rubbed you up the wrong way I'd definitely suggest giving Daring Greatly a chance, as it's a much more comprehensive (and kind) exploration of the same themes.This was book 24 in my #Dymocks52challenge refined.

100,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31777090-suhaib,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book is about setting and honing personal values. It's about determining what to give a fuck about in your life. In Manson's witty words, managing the amount of fucks you give. Minimizing the scope of your interests really—to the essentials. Putting all of your eggs in that one basket. Figuring out what that basket is in the first place. Does that make sense?I enjoyed a couple of ideas. One of them is on the importance of cultivating doubt. Manson claims that uncertainty is the way forward and that the key to personal growth lies in being comfortable with it. The comfort breeds an openness that obliterates sticking to rigid values and motivates us towards positive change. Uncertainty breaks the entitlement chain, the belief that you're a special snowflake who deserves special treatment from the world—the naivety of expecting something for nothing, to be loved for doing nothing, to be appreciated for doing nothing, and so on. To break the hold of the spell of certainty and entitlement, Mr. Manson proposes asking yourself three golden questions:1- What if I'm wrong? 2- What would it mean if I'm wrong? 3- Would me being wrong create better problems? I tried them for size and trust me, the sheer entertaining of the possibility of being wrong is refreshing. Also wonderful in cultivating compassion, humility, and acceptance of oneself and others. The success formula Manson proposes goes something like this:Happiness comes from solving problems, and the quality of your problems is determined by the quality of your values and metrics, the standards by which you measure your success. Naturally, the better the problems, the more successful you are. Good problems come from having good values and metrics. And so Manson dedicates more than half of his book to what he sees as the five most important values, and he summarizes them on page 89 in one paragraph:""The first ... is a radical form of responsibility: taking responsibility for everything that occurs in your life, regardless of who's at fault. The second is uncertainty: the acknowledgment of your own ignorance and the cultivation of constant doubt in your own beliefs. The next is failure ... The fourth is rejection: the ability to both say and hear no ... The final value is the contemplation of one's own mortality.""Another idea that stuck is the Do Something Principle, the idea that action can and sometimes should precede motivation. This reminded me of Ralph Waldo Emerson's famous quote: ""Do the thing and you shall have the power."" Most of us, unfortunately, spend our entire lives waiting for that power to come down, waiting for the muse instead of moving in the direction of our dreams. Action > Inspiration > Motivation > Action... (Loop) In the end, The Subtle Art is a sobering unconventional take on self-help, and I recommend it for people looking for just that. Three stars and a half, with a grain of salt. My rating came down from four and a half thanks to me cultivating doubt about this book. So here goes that Mr. Manson."

Subtitled, 'A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life', this book offers an alternative path than the vast majority of self-help books out there, but does it work?As someone who has lived a lot of his life with the approach that we are in control of how we react to our external environment and stimuli, I can say that most of this approach would work for me. I wholeheartedly agree that many of us are building up who we are to match how we want people to see us, as determined by 24/7 marketing and peer pressure re: supposed ideals. I agree with a lot of the concepts in this book.. B U T... having broken a personal book reading rule and spoken to a fellow (women) reader about how she saw the book, I may have now been influenced by her view that the writer is a 'bit of a dick'!1. There's absolutely no real need for all the profanity in the book... it adds nothing, but just the feeling, of yet another know it all comedian swearing a lot... to meet an idealised view of 'keeping it real'.2. Probably not his fault, but the writer seems to relish at other peoples' and his own incorrect approaches. Do we really need to put something down so much, to make a concept seem better?3. The whole tone is kind of jarring and knowingly superior.On the flipside, as I said before, the concept is great, superb! But I am still unsure if a one size fits all approach, and think that maybe different approaches will work for different people? Don't get me wrong, this whole concept absolute resonates for me, and having read this book, I will aim to personally travel further along this path. The summary of this book, is that for me personally it is superb and so much on the money, taking the modern world to task at what it's doing to humanity. And the section on modern love... wunderbar!! An easy 9.5 out of 12."

(I won't use the * because it's pointless, why do we still do it?)I have a hate/like/hate/hate relationship with this genre. FOMO pushed me to reserve this on the library overdrive a while ago. Also, while it's becoming a publishing schtick, I enjoy swear words - as long as they're not in my native language. I don't know about you, but I would love to have the confidence of this American, middle-class, privileged white guy, with a finance degree, to come out and write a book on how to live your life the right way. I tried to keep an open mind, it's not his fault that he's American, middle-class etc., you know, #notallXYZ... Thank goodness, Roger Wayne, the narrator of this book was excellent, had it not been for him, and the audiobook's duration, I wouldn't have finished.The beginning was really promising, well, I liked it a lot, I thought this will be so up my alley, as it professed itself to be an anti self-help book, against that mindless positive crappolla that is prevalent in the field. I'm not so sure that was achieved.That's not to say there weren't good things in the book. As far as I'm concerned, nothing was new, groundbreaking or will impact me in any way (truthfully, not many, if any, books in the genre ever had, to my dismay, as there's so much room for improvement where I'm concerned). My biggest gripe with this book was that Manson doesn't seem to take into account people's genetic make-up and experiences. It is a complex notion, probably not covered when studying for a business degree, I know mine never did. Not to mention, saying that genes have a huge role in one's make-up would be counterintuitive and unproductive, as it wouldn't leave that much for the self-help gurus to write and preach about. "

""Everything worthwhile in life is won through surmounting the associated negative experience. Any attempt to escape the negative, to avoid it or quash it or silence it, only backfires. The avoidance of suffering is a form of suffering. The avoidance of struggle is a struggle. The denial of failure is a failure. Hiding what is shameful is itself a form of shame.Pain is an inextricable thread in the fabric of life, and to tear it out is not only impossible, but destructive: attempting to tear it out unravels everything else with it. To try to avoid pain is to give too many fucks about pain. In contrast, if you’re able to not give a fuck about the pain, you become unstoppable.""
I can't explain how much i love this book. It was even more fun listening to it than reading it. Plus, it's a very short listen; about 6 hours if I remember correctly. It starts off pretty light-hearted and funny with some good points. Then it gets pretty heavy by the end. The last 2 chapter were probably my favorite. It's not a book about giving no fucks at all, only psychopaths and liars don't care about anything, but more so about figuring out what is worthy of the fucks you'll give. Whether you think you give too many fucks or aren't sure what to give a fuck about, read this book. At the very least it's worth using one of your audible credits on. "

Manson takes old philosophical and Buddhism concepts and adds f* bombs to every point. Some of the points Manson discusses is quite relevant, like taking control of our life and taking responsibilities for our actions. While most of the book is about the same idea which is alright, however, there exist other books, better books - minus the f-bombs.Hence, this book is best for people having a hard time with self-help books, this spicy *f-bomb* formula might do the trick, unlike for others which may be the opposite to good.

It’s not so much that I read these style of books and watch endless amounts of Youtube videos on the topic in the search of the elusive and ultimate magical cure for the negative elements of life. I consume all the media available on the topic, instead, as positive background noise to my daily life. I find it soothing to immerse myself in an endless uplifting stream that is hopefully, somewhere, penetrating my psyche with the often repetitive message they all deliver.However, this is a self-improvement book with a difference. I went into it believing the abrasive title would lead to a tough love approach for life delivered inside. To an extent, it does. It also does so much more. It really does teach us how to stop giving a fuck!This book negates that we are all special little snowflakes and that our suffering means something. It groups humans together into an endless cycle of individuals who are born and die and most get to mean nothing along the way. Instead of this becoming a depressing ideology, Manson’s dry humour alleviates the nature of the contents and his explanations allow the reader to understand the freedom that lies in this way of thinking.It forces us to confront and understand negative cycles of thinking that our upbringing and the society we reside in promote. Often, these are cycles we are completely unaware of. Often, they are honed through very early childhood experiences or the cycles that our guardians are themselves trapped inside of.By not alleviating our suffering to some sort of holy plane, it does not romance or justify it. It can be hard to believe that no majestic view is granted to us, as we struggle over the final hurdle in our mountain of oppression. This view is there, but it is only granted to the hustlers, and not as a reward for all those who suffer, which is all of us, no matter what our psyches have been brainwashed to believe.My review does not begin to scratch the surface for all the multitude of truth this book delivers. There was no dense scientific backing and Manson’s conversational tone was retained throughout. For me, that only made it all the harder to negate what knowledge was imparted as it seems like this contained only common sense, but common sense that society has hidden from us."

Written by someone who is sick and tired of hearing incessant and aggravating platitudes about positive thinking? Fine, I’ll bite. Also, my dad bought me the follow up book for my birthday, and I wanted to do the preliminary reading before tearing into that one.I have always loathed asinine self-help books, you know the ones that keep telling you to be your best self and that good things will magically come your way… The problem with these books is that when whatever magical formula they are selling you doesn’t work (spoiler alert…), you just feel like an even bigger failure than you did when you shamefully bought the book on Amazon, so that no one would see you checking it out at the book store register. This is obviously not that book. And that got my attention, because I figured it was about time there be a book that told people to just, you know, be themselves, work with what they got and stop caring about the stuff that doesn’t actually matter. The fact that it was a best seller intrigued me: were people actually listening to this? Weird!Let me summarize the whole thing for you, in case you don’t have the patience (and good fortune to have a lovely colleague who will lend you his copy): we give to many fucks, and we need to learn to be more discriminate about the fucks we give. There is a finite amount of them, and we have to stop being so slutty with our fucks. And yes, that is the tenure of language you can expect if you do decide to read this cover to cover.Manson argues that we are caught up in the “always striving for more” vicious cycle that creates perpetual dissatisfaction and has serious consequences, such as the strain on our mental health, our consumer habits, our increasingly warped human interactions. And his solution is to stop caring so damn much about things that don’t matter, stop comparing ourselves to everyone on social media and use the so-called negative experiences we go through has building blocks for better experiences. The book takes those ideas and breaks them down into chewable pieces about the subtleties of Manson’s philosophy of “zero fucks given”.The dose of good old fashioned common sense (which I recently discovered was never meant as “everyone has it” common but rather has “for the good of everyone” common! Chew on that for a bit!), reality check and reminder to not sweat the small stuff is nice – and much needed in many cases. A little dose of sane perspective has never hurt anything else than someone’s ego, after all. Mark Manson didn’t exactly teach me anything, though bless his heart for trying so damn hard. But I’m glad this book is as popular as it is, because a lot of people do need to hear this. I did notice as I get older that I have gotten extremely selective with the amount of fucks I give, and I do tend to save them up for fewer things, and I can’t deny that it makes life better, and I honestly wish more people would unbunch their panties and get a little perspective. And as much as I hate to admit it, that book just might help unbunch a whole lot of panties.I like that Manson describes happiness as a work in progress and negative emotions as a call to action. I am glad he addressed the entitlement and mollycoddling issues that have been plaguing many milieus in the past few years (I like his phrasing here: “victimhood chic”), and that he reminds readers that where they are in life is a consequence of choices they have made, so they are responsible for their problem, and that everyone ought to be a bit more mindful of their intentions and motivations. A lot of people need to hear that. Hell, there have been times in my life when I needed to hear it too, and I am glad I did! That said, the book is far from perfect. It contains a quantity of lovely platitudes, the whole bad-ass attitude schtick gets old fast (and that’s coming from someone who uses the f-word as punctuation in her daily life). Also, I rolled my eyes at his “practical enlightenment” idea. I get what he means, but the term he coined rubs me the wrong way a little. As did his slap-dash retelling of the life of the Buddha. For the same reason. Also, I do not buy that his wife “likes” being told she looks like shit: I think that like any decent spouse, she has just learnt to accept a certain amount of BS, in her case, her husband’s lack of tact.My personal appreciation of this book would make it a 2-star read, but I also seriously think many people need to hear that stuff, no matter how condescending and unpleasant it comes across as, so I’m bumping it up to 3, because I’m glad it’s there. I hope it makes its way into the hands of few more people, who could really use the reality check."

This book will not teach you how to gain or achieve, but rather how to lose and let go.
از رک بودنش لذت بردم و بارها توی فصلهای اولش بلند بلند خندیدم به سادگیِ کلماتی که می خوندم. به اینکه انگار یه بچه چهار ساله روبروم نشسته بود و دلمو می برد با حرفهای ساده و لحن قشنگش. به اینکه انگار بهم میگفت برای چند دقیقه این بارِ سنگینِ روی دوشهات رو بذار زمین و همراه من بیا...
Negative emotions are a call to action. when you feel them, it's because you're supposed to do something.
شاید خیلی ها بگن حرف هاش تکراری بود و حرف جدیدی نداشت. درسته. خیلی هاش رو قبلا بارها شنیده بودم و حتی باورشون دارم. اما دلیل نمیشه وقتی با کلمات جدید و ساده تری می خونمشون؛ لذت نبرم. برای همین لذت بردم و انگار که با باز کردنِ کتاب سوار سرسره شده باشم، آروم و مطمئن تا انتهای این سرسره سُر می خوردم و بعد از هربار بستنِ کتاب، با لبخند از روی سرسره بلند می شدم و سراغ زندگی می رفتم. لبخندی که نمیشد انکارش کرد. حالی که نمیشد به اطرافیان منتقلش نکرد.
what pain do you want in your life? what are you willing to struggle for?
کتاب رو تموم کردم اما هنوزم یکی از سوالاتش رو بیشتر از همه دوست دارم. اونجا که گفت:همه ازت میپرسن از زندگی چی میخوای... و تو جواب میدی که خوشبختی، دل خوش، پول، حال خوش. و تمام عمر در جستجوشون دست و پا میزنی و خسته ای از نرسیدنی که تحملت رو کم کرده. و انگار ته دلت باور داری که نمیشه اما رهاش نمیکنی و این خودآزاری رو ادامه میدی.اما شاید سوالی که بهتره بهش جواب بدی اینه: ترجیح میدی چه دردی توی زندگیت داشته باشی؟ ترجیح میدی به خاطر چه چیزی بجنگی و توی زندگیت کشمکش داشته باشی؟ چه چیزی برات ارزش درد کشیدن داره؟و پیداش کن. پیداش کن و به قول چارلز بوکوفسکی عزیز؛آنچه را که عاشقانه دوست می داری،بیابو بگذار تو را بکشد.

118,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/957634-daniel-clausen,Rating 5 out of 5,"This was a case of the right book at the wrong time for me. Unfortunately, I read this book right after I had finished my own self-help book ""The Underground Novel: An Alternative Guide to Life after Graduation"". I read this book without realizing how similar the two books might be -- the similarity between the voice of this author and my own character's voice was uncanny...That being said, it was an easy, breezy read and embraced many of the things I like in anti-self-help. I enjoyed the nods to stoicism, Buddhism, and sheer common sense. I appreciated the focus on values. For me, the gold in this book came from insights on psychology, specifically the psychology of relationships. I've always wondered why certain people seek out abusive partners. I have some thoughts on the subject cobbled together from my time reading abnormal psychology and Freud. But this was many years ago, and this book was able to present some satisfying answers clearly, and with the confident voice of someone who has been in those types of relationships. For anyone thinking of reading this book, I would recommend you prioritize reading ""Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance."" I think that is a far more essential book. It is also a complicated literary work in ways that ""The Subtle Art"" is not. What I like most about narrative as a form of self-help philosophy is that the author creates layers of meaning that might have multiple, perhaps even contradictory readings. I truly believe that any good self-help book should at some point make the reader puzzle over questions for his or herself. This book was not very subtle. It could at times be very blunt. That's okay too. Blunt is also another way of being honest. And this is an honest attempt to retell simple truths. The most essential is that living based in non-shitty core values is the only life worth living. That's a great message to pass on, no matter how many F-bombs are you used to pass it on. "

But.. I think it's great to bring up having good solid 'metrics' aka values, and stop giving f@$%'s about what's not important. Which I kinda think I do, but hey, I'm a pretty shakey work in progress, right?A candid quote, and I like its forthrightness: It's not about giving a fuck about everything your partner gives a fuck about; it's about giving a fuck about your partner regardless of the fucks he or she gives. That's unconditional love, baby.The author brings up valid points on bad childhoods, adversity, being violated, facing numerous hindrances, but it is always our sole responsibility for us to move on despite of these negatives and to keep putting our best foot forward. These types of ideas may seem basic, but I think can always serve as a good reminder. Just like the entitlement theme that is covered here as well. I think he has a point. Again, important things for me to take away, and if I don't take away I lose, as does everyone around me and this can't be a good thing."

I pre-ordered this book from some recommendation and forgot about it until it showed up, at which point I had some vague notion of what the book was about. Turned out to be much better than I expected. It covers some really deep insights about making meaning out of one's life, far exceeding what one would expect from someone as young as the author. The writing was really good in a sense that it was colloquial and sophisticated. The numerous anecdotes and references were esoteric (to me) and often surprised me in their conclusions. For most people who have their heads straight (knowing what to say no to, what to focus on, being humble and hard working), this book serves as a great reminder. For those who have not figured it out yet, this is the introduction book to realizing what's important in your life."

124,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22583912-fareya,Rating 4 out of 5,"I am not one to read a lot of self-help books, but this title caught my eyes. I mean, is the art of not giving a f*ck really subtle? I wouldn’t think so. Naturally, I was very curious on what the author has to say! So, I bought this bright orange catchy book and it sat on my shelf for almost two years, until a few days back when I finally picked it up, but only because I was in a fiction reading slump, not because I wanted a life coach coaching me on how to live. Honestly, I didn’t even expect to like this, but these slightly vulgar, no-nonsense, conversational 200 pages seriously surprised me.Let’s start with the language, which is easy to read and communicative, but the first fifty or so pages have an abundance of profanity in them, it’s left and right and thrown in with every other sentence. I admit I was somewhat put off by this, but with the title being what it is, this wasn’t completely unexpected. And more so, the philosophy and concepts the author talks about made so much sense, that I chose to overlook the vulgarism, and I am glad I did.“In life, we have limited amount of f*cks to give. So you must choose your f*cks wisely.”The quote mentioned above is essentially what I thought to be the crux of this book. Obviously, this one sentence is not as simple as it might seem. The idea behind not giving a f*ck is not about being indifferent but rather about being at ease with being different. It is about choosing one’s own battles and accepting one’s emotions, even if they are not always inherently positive.One of the best things I liked about this book was the talk on choice and acceptance, where the author emphasizes that it’s okay to have negative emotions and it’s okay to feel bad at times. What is important, is how we choose to deal with those emotions later. Convincing myself that I feel good, when I don’t, or believing that my life is perfect when in fact it is a total mess is not healthy. I seriously never believed in the be positive all the time and the situation will fix itself crap, so this was a welcome concept for me. How can a person be positive all the time, be happy all the time? That is simply not human! Pain and struggle is just as important as being happy. Negative emotions are just as important as their positive counterparts. Accepting is the way to go, not suppressing or denying. And most importantly, one needs to take action in order to change something.Anyway, moving on, this book has a bunch of other really profound and solid points to make. I’ll try summarizing a few of them briefly below:- stop blaming yourself and others and take responsibility for your actions- our struggles determine our successes, do not think you deserve something if you’re not willing to struggle for it- avoiding rejection, confrontation and conflicts and attempting to accept everything is a deep and subtle form of entitlement; avoid being an entitled, self-absorbed person- nothing in life is certain, better embrace the uncertaintyOne last thing worth mentioning is that this book also has a number of inspiring, real-life stories, including a few from the author’s life as well, that reinforce the philosophy and concepts stated. I thought that was a nice touch.That’s all. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life , is an anti self help book, which I believe can be quite helpful. Remember though, you need to overlook its vulgarity and retain the thought-provoking, useful concepts!For more reviews visit my blog Booktimistic - Books, Outdoors & Optimism"

E foarte bine că vă dați seama că greșiți undeva și vreți să schimbați asta, dar să citiți astfel de cărți înseamnă doar să vă puneți mintea și viața în mâinile unor străini care câștigă bani din forma asta de manipulare, menită doar să uniformizeze oamenii și să îi îndoctrineze cumva. Viața e cea mai bună carte de dezvoltare personală. Citiți orice simțiți că vă ajută sufletul, dar vă și antrenează mintea, vorbiți cu oamenii în parc, vizitați orice puteți, mergeți singuri la un local, suflați în păpădii, fiți sinceri cu voi și cu ceilalți, mângâiați animalele, exprimați-vă părerea fără temeri, dar politicos, învățați să vă simțiți bine și în singurătate. Un pic de energie pozitivă de-aici, un pic de-acolo. Așa strânge furnica și greierul e ofticat. Abia când o să vă acceptați voi pe voi, o să vă crească încrederea în sine și veți fi mai greu de rănit, fără să aveți nevoie de Dale Carnegie, Mark Manson și alții care profită de vulnerabilitatea voastră. Să știi ce vrei și să faci tot ce poți pentru asta, fără a-i răni pe alții, e printre cele mai mari forme de succes. Dacă chiar vreți să citiți ceva de dezvoltare personală, o recomand pe asta doar la o reducere și doar pentru prima parte, unde am găsit idei sănătoase.

I write life advice that is science-based, pragmatic, and non-bullshitty – i.e., life advice that doesn’t suck. Some people say I’m an idiot. Other people say I saved their life. Read on and decide for yourself.”This is what greets you on his site’s first page. I didn’t read on, but I just finished his book and I have to say, he’s not an idiot, he just knows how to make money giving “life advices”, or so he thinks he is.If humans excel on something, that is giving advices. You get one for every problem you have, you get one even if you don’t have a problem. What, you don't need an advice? Here is one! Humans know all that it’s best for others, MM included. The only difference is that the author gets paid for his advices, much more than the real psychologists do.I wouldn’t have picked it up if a friend of mine, whose opinion I value, wouldn’t have recommend it to me. Well, I’ll know better next time.The whole time I had the impression that I’m reading a FB page, with a lot of “don’t give a f*uck” about this and that, focus on yourself kind of stuff, which is reasonable up to a point.But in the whole book there is not an original idea and he contradicts himself a lot. One example: at the end of the book, he tells us that, when he was 18, a friend of his died drowning by accident. He was depressed for almost a year and afterwards had a revelation and started to see the world through different eyes (he was 19). At the beginning of the book, he said that until 22 (or so) he just wasted his time with different pleasures (buzz, lots of girlfriends, he even visited 55 countries), which is great for that age, even if you’re older (I’m in my 40s and I would still like to visit all the countries in the world). And then he tells us how a man wrote to him that he can’t get over the death of his boy and that his advice on how you choose to deal with grief is bullshit. And he rants that he understood that father’s grief, but it’s his choice to suffer. No shit, Manson! Did you lose a child? Do you know how that feels? My best friend lost her first child when he was 18 months old. I was there with her night and day for some time and I can’t describe how it was and how I felt. And it was not my child; you can’t imagine how it was for the mother. So next time, wouldn’t hurt to be more considerate when judging someone’s feelings.We get advised to don’t give a f*uck about a lot of things, trivialities mostly, which I can agree with (the only reason this book gets 2 stars), but then he says that one should do only what one chooses to, like you don’t have to help someone by obligation, but only if you choose to do so. If only life would be that easy… My guess is that MM didn’t get a lot of hardship in his life.Of course, there are cases and cases, each different but when you hear someone preaching that kind of I-know-all advice, it gets tiring and annoying. And there a lot of other examples I can rant about, but I choose to follow his advice: I don*t give a f*uck about them, so why waste my time.Yes, one should not waste its time caring too much about looks, fame, money, popularity, etc. But tell this to a teenager. I think most of us have been there already and got over it, so these advices are kinda useless now.Bottom line, this book is a collection of advices extracted from different philosophies, even Buddhism, retold with a lot of f*ucks in between and the author's personal examples of how great he understands life and other people. It was not a complete waste of time, because it’s easy to read, there are a few decent ideas in it, even if wrongly explained, and I got amused from time to time by how smug he is."

Αντίθετα, ο συγγραφέας προσπαθεί να δείξει ότι τα λίγα πράγματα για τα οποία πρέπει κανείς να ενδιαφέρεται, δεν έχει νόημα να περιστρέφονται γύρω από στόχους το χρήμα ή η καταξίωση, γιατί αν ποτέ αυτοί οι στόχοι εκπληρωθούν, μένεις ξαφνικά χωρίς προβλήματα και το πιθανότερο είναι ότι τότε θα αρχίσει το existential crisis.

It started off OK but he lost me in the passages he basically tells parents who lost their children that it is up to them not to give a f*ck and the passages about false memory. It all went downhill from there. I guess you have to be a certain kind of person to understand and appreciate what Manson really means - a very priviledged person.I found it unsettling and even harmful he can make very strong claims in delicate psychological matters without having any degree in psychology/psychiatry, as almost all his sentences are formed without the necessary empathy and can often be interpreted as victim shaming - too bad if you fail not to care.In my life, I have given a fuck about many people and many things. I have also not given a fuck about many people and many things.

Εξίσωνε την στεναχώρια που είχε απο το κέρατο της πρώην του με εκείνη που έχει ένας γονέας που γνώρισε κάπου, ο οποίος έχει χάσει το παιδί του. Το καλύτερο είναι πως θύμωσε κιόλας με τον πατέρα αυτόν επειδή του εξηγούσε πως η στεναχώρια είναι στεναχώρια ασχέτως με την αιτία εμφάνισής της. Δηλαδή η στεναχώρια που έχασε μια γκόμενα είναι η ίδια με εκείνη του πατέρα που έχασε το παιδί του. Λογική που κάνει έναν άνθρωπο που έχει βιώσει τέτοια απώλεια στην καλύτερη να τραβάει τις κωλ*τριχες. Μετά δείχνει πόσο άνετος είναι όταν αναφέρει πως δεν τον πείραξε καθόλου το σκηνικό και δεν έδωσε ούτε ένα Fuck ενώ διαβάζουμε στο βιβλίο που έκδωσε το ίδιο αυτό σκηνικό. Αποτύπωσε στην αιωνιότητα κάτι που δεν έδωσε ούτε ένα fuck. ΑΧΑΧΑ ρε τον μπαγάσα. Ο τύπος δεν μπορεί καν να διαχωρίσει καταστάσεις. Τα πλισέ του εγκεφάλου του δεν μπορούν να δώσουν το ερέθισμα να δημιουργήσει μια κλίμακα αξιών στο μυαλό του για να μπορεί να συγκρίνει καταστάσεις. Δεν έχει τις προσλαμβάνουσες να κατανοήσει και να ταξινομήσει τις σκέψεις του και έτσι χάνεται στον συρφετό ανοησιών που έχει στο μυαλό του. Τί άλλο κάνει ένας κακός συγγραφίσκος που αφενός δεν σέβεται τον εαυτό του και αφετέρου τον αναγνώστη; Καλά μαντέψατε. Αναφέρει ως κλασικό κακέκτυπο άνδρα που είναι, τα γαμήσια που έκανε στη φοιτητική του ζωή καθώς και την μαριχουάνα που γύρναγε με τα άλλα τα τζιμάνια. Εντωμεταξύ το κορυφαίο είναι πως τα έγραφε με τέτοιο τρόπο που μου έδωσε την εντύπωση πως περίμενε να του δώσω μετάλλιο. Υπάρχει όμως ένα θέμα που αν έχει διαβάσει κανείς 3-4 καλά βιβλία το καταλαβαίνει αμέσως. Ο τύπος λέει ψέματα για την προσωπική του ζωή γιατί φάσκει και αντιφάσκει. Καλά δεν βάζω το χέρι μου στη φωτιά γιατί μπορεί απλά να μην μπορεί να γράψει και να μου φάνηκε περίεργο. Με τι άλλο να ασχοληθεί όμως ο Μαρκ για να μας επιβεβαιώσει τις κακές μας εντυπώσεις; Τι έμεινε αφού ισοπέδωσε τα πάντα; Τις εργασιακές εμπειρίες και συμβουλές. Συμβουλές απο έναν 35αρη που έχει δουλέψει 6 βδομάδες part time στη ζωή του ΧΑΧΑΧΑ ρε μπαγάσα τι απάτη είσαι. Ας πιάσουμε και λίγο τις ερωτικές σχέσεις το σημείο που προσωπικά μιλόντας ήταν και η σταγόνα που ξεχείλισε το ποτήρι μου. Δεν ξύπνησε καλά η κοπέλα του μια μέρα και επειδή δεν ντύθηκε ωραία ούτε ήταν στις καλές της, της είπε με τρομερά κάφρικο και ψευτοαντρίκειο τρόπο ένα "" Πως είσαι έτσι; Που να σε πάω;"" Και νιώθει τόσο υπερήφανος που το έκανε και μας λέει και παντοφλάκηδες με τα πολλά γιατί δεν είχαμε τα κότσια να το πούμε γιατί εν τέλει θα ήταν για καλό της. Μπράβο ρε Μάνσον είσαι πολύ καπάτσος και A-MALE. Την έσκισες την γάτα.ΓΙΑ ΝΑ ΤΕΛΕΙΩΝΟΥΜΕ: Το βιβλίο είναι γεμάτο με κλισεδιές και κοινούς τόπους όπως το ""όλ��ς είναι πουτάνες"", "" I DON'T GIVE A FUCK "", ""Get rich or die trying"" και άλλα τέτοιες ματαιότητες που σηματοδοτούν την επιπεδότητα και την ρηχότητα της σημερινής κοινωνίας και πιό συγκεκριμένα την έλλειψη ιδανικών του νέου ανθρώπου που είναι φτιαγμένος κατ εικόνα και καθ ομοίωση του Μάνσον. Ενας ανθρωπάκος που εκμεταλλεύεται την φθορά της κοινωνίας για να φτιάξει όνομα, μιας και τα πάντα πλέον είναι η δημοσιότητα. Τι μας μάρανε; Αυτό! Έχω ξαναδεί παρόμοιους όμως είναι η πρώτη φορά που βλέπω συγγραφέα να ακολουθεί μοτίβο ρητορείας το οποίο μειώνει τον αναγνώστη ως άτομο κα�� ως προσωπικότητα για να ανεβάσει τον εαυτό του.Παιδιά δεν αξίζει να δώσετε ούτε μισό ευρώ για αυτό το πράγμα. Συγγνώμη για τη βιαστική γραφή μου αλλά δεν ήθελα να δώσω παραπάνω σκέψη και χρόνο σε αυτό το φληνάφημα. Θεωρώ αυτά αρκετά για να σας πείσουν. Σίγουρα κάποιος με περισσότερη εμπειρία στα βιβλία θα έβρισκε και άλλα να πει. Αν θέλετε πάντως αυτοβελτίωση διαβάστε Λούκι Λουκ.***Για να μην παρεξηγηθούμε. Το βιβλίο έχει και μερικά καλα points μέσα ωστόσο εγώ κρίνω την γενική εικόνα και πάντα με γνώμονα το hype και το πόσο σοβαρά το πήρε πρώτα ο ίδιος και μετά το κοινό."
135,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2922699-genia-lukin,Rating 2 out of 5,"The longer I think about this book in retrospective, the lower a rating it gets.It's a book that I was incredibly tempted into liking. It suits my worldview, in a great many ways. It throws self-help and fake positivity crap out the window, and tells you quite overtly that pain is a part of life, that life ain't fair, and that it's all about your effort, so get your act together, asshole. It suits my self-blaming, cynical, critical, perfectionist philosophy.The longer I think about this book, though, the more it leaves a sour sort of taste in my mouth.For one, it doesn't actually do away with guilt. On the contrary, it replaces your guilt of not being the best, of not being great or happy, with the guilt of not living up to the standards of this book. You're now guilty of giving too many fucks, of not being willing to accept pain, of not being strong enough or active enough. The book wants you to want the pain as part of the reward - and that's fine, it is as it should be, but it forgets to give you breathing room because pain is painful, and difficulties are difficult. And no sane person wants pain or difficulty.So, yes, you want the easy way out. You want the results and gratification without the pain of achieving them. Everybody does. Everybody, even those who put in the work, would much prefer to succeed without doing the work. They don't actually like the pain - they're just willing to tolerate it. the book doesn't actually teach you how to accept both the fact that pain is part of gain and the fact that you, as a normal, sane human being, don't like pain and aren't obligated to. The book doesn't teach you to forgive yourself for slipping and to try again. If you fail at something, it's because you ""didn't actually want it"" and that, frankly, is nonsense. I have no fucks to give for that kind of victim-blaming statement.It spends a lot of time talking about entitlement. Entitlement, it is generally recognized, is bad. you ain't entitled to anything, it says. But that, too, is false. Entitlement is bad when it's overextended, when it's out of whack, but entitlement in and of itself is important. Entitlement is the measure of fairness. And we are entitled! we're entitled to a fair chance, we're entitled to an equitable place in life. If we're ill or psychologically damaged we're entitled to help. A person without entitlement is a person without a sense of fairness or justice, and that, believe me, is as psychologically bad as what the book calls ""the entitled asshole"".There is some good advice in this book, and a great deal to like. It tells you to remember that what feels pleasant isn't necessarily good for you, and not to pay too much attention to your emotions, it tells you to prioritize the things you need to care about in life, it tells you that nice is not the ultimate value, and should not be... and it's right. But it's important to take it with the sort of grain of salt with which it seems to have been written, otherwise, I feel, because it also judges you, trivializes what pain and difficulty actually entail, and forgets that the absence of qualities is not actually the opposite of having these qualities - it's the reverse, and that is different."
136,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23564744-duds-saldanha,Rating 1 out of 5,"Primeiramente queria deixar registrado que eu parei em 30%.Não terminei esse livro, não tenho a menor intenção e vou explicar por quê.Dei uma estrela simplesmente porque eu entendo que a ideia do livro vem de um lugar muito puro cheio de boas intenções e de ideias pra discutir. E muito do que ele fala no livro é realmente verdade e ""in-your-face truth"" como ele e as milhões de reviews o descrevem. E eu consigo ver como o Mark como pessoa mesmo vem de um lugar puro e cheio de boas intenções (pra quem não lembra, foi ele que escreveu aquele texto ""An Open Letter To Brazil"" onde ele fala bastante sobre o Brasil como sociedade e que pecou um pouco em falar que nosso jeitinho é uma coisa exatamente ruim mas falou umas coisas muito legais sobre as revoluções internas que temos que fazer pra poder sobreviver ao golpe que nos foi dado).O problema desse livro reside em três coisas, especialmente:1) O primeiro problema é que o livro está repleto de frases clichês (que precisam ser ditas sim), mas são frases clichês que eu escrevo quase que diariamente nas redes sociais do Indiretas do Bem, lugar onde eu trabalho há 4 anos. Não é nada novo. As reflexões não são novas, e não vão a lugar nenhum novo. O clichê não é um problema. O clichê pelo clichê é sim um problema. E ah, Mark, FYI: adicionar fuck/fucking dentro de um clichê não faz com que você seja autor dele. Só te faz rude mesmo. Paz.2) O segundo problema é que o jeito com os exemplos são dados para cada situação ruim é, antes de tudo, típico de branco cagando regra. Isso por si só já seria bem ruim se ele não usasse esses mesmos exemplos pra diminuir todas as outras pessoas de modo a vermos ele como o panda especial e maneiro detentor de toda a verdade da vida. De verdade? Próximo!3) O último problema e talvez o pior de todos é que, até onde eu li e até onde eu vi do índice, ele em nenhum momento considera DOENÇAS MENTAIS. Cada vez que eu tinha que ler que o pensamento negativo era uma escolha que fazíamos eu pensava nas minhas sessões de terapia e fazia uma cara horrível dentro do metrô. Deu bastante dó de mim mesma. O autor pode até ter pensado que não era seu lugar falar sobre transtornos mentais se ele mesmo não os tiver, mas não considerar isso é irresponsável. Ele chega a dizer que depressão é um dos resultados de escolhas ruins. Ou seja.Pra não ser muito injusta e justificar a 1 estrela, o capítulo 2 ""Happiness is a Problem"" é bom e fala sobre a importância de ""sentir"" dor (no sentido de que precisamos da dor para crescer) e a importância de saber se você gosta da jornada ou só do resultado. Esse capítulo é bem interessante, mas definitivamente não vale o seu dinheiro."

139,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36348070-brandice,Rating 4 out of 5,"3.5 stars - When I first starting reading this book, I became a bit skeptical of the hype. I was waiting for it to suck me in because it seemed obvious and ordinary. A lot of the information in the book is not new, and well, kind of common sense.I think I would’ve gotten more from this book if I’d read it in my back early 20s, instead of a decade later, but I don’t regret reading it now. There were still some good takeaways and I appreciate the “different” perspective provided to get there.The main message of The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F* is not telling you to DGAF about anything, but to choose what you want to GAF about, based on your own values (not the values you feel socially pressured to accept), and stop worrying about who it angers in the process. Simple, right? I did really enjoy the last chapter which was about confronting your mortality and the legacy you’ll leave behind. Not groundbreaking but at about 200 pages, worth the quick read as a refresher."

146,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14097149-ginger,Rating 3 out of 5,"2.5/3 stars. I liked this but it didn't blow me away.Some of the information in this book is common sense and I agreed with some topics such as not comparing your life to others. You’ll never be happy with your life if you’re always trying to keep up with the Joneses.One topic that he talks about that I did not agree with is not pursuing happiness, dealing with hardships, and happiness will just eventually find you.With the amount of drug addiction deaths, cancer deaths and suicides that have happened in my family, I’ve had plenty of hardships. I’ve had to pursue that happiness to get out of bed in the morning. I’ve been in that pit of depression and didn’t know how to get out of it.I think his approach of being happy now is a good concept, but what if you can’t be?And if you can’t be happy right now, what’s the steps with being happy later?His approach on that was a bit basic and he could have expanded a bit more on it.I do think that one of the best things in the book is choosing which f*cks to give instead of giving a f*ck about everything.We’ve only got so much time in life so choose which f*cks to really care about.This resonated the most with me.The book also got repetitive, and I noticed that I wasn’t getting as much from it when I was halfway through.Plus, I do think that the narrator, Roger Wayne got a bit condescending at times. I’m guessing that’s what the author, Mark Manson wanted?!Either way, he sounded like an ass at times and I can see why that would turn some people off.I’m glad I finally checked this one out.The cussing and bluntness did not bother me, and I think it worked better with me since I have a finely tuned in bullshit detector. Other then that, I think you can get some good information from this, but I wouldn’t put all my f*cks into it."
147,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,Rating 4 out of 5,"""In life, we have limited amount of fucks to give. So you must choose your fucks wisely.""There is an incredible amount ""f*cks"" mentioned in Mark Manson's sentences in the first 50 pages. It got on my nerves. Either it lessened afterwards or the content of the book improved to such a degree that a bit of off-putting language didn't bother me anymore. This is a brilliant handbook on how to do well in life. It's in tune with the books on cognitive psychology written by the Norwegian hypocondria doctor Ingvard Wilhelmsen. It also take a case against hedonistic society most of us live in, where we seek pleasure as the ultimate goal and have bad values.""Good values are 1) reality-based, 2) socially constructive, and 3) immediate and controllable. Bad values are 1) superstitious, 2) socially destructive and 3) not immediate or controllable. [...] Some examples of good, healthy values: honesty, innovation, vulnerability, standing up for oneself, standing up for others, self-respect, curiosity, charity, humility, creativity.""Then Mark moves on the importance of feeling pain and having problems. These are necessary aspects for growth. You cannot ever get anywhere without failing. This is a tough one. I hate failing. I hate being wrong, but I work out of the premise that I probably am - meaning it's easier than it could have been. I like many of the problems I have at work because I get a kick out of solving them (but then I get new problems out of the ones I've fixed). A day with nothing to rack my brains on is a boring day. Thankfully, in my line of work, that's about three days a year. Still, messing up sucks. I do it regularly. The only way to not do anything wrong is to do nothing. According to the message from Mark Manson, since I have problems I enjoy solving and feel the still regular pain is worthwhile, I have the ""right"" problems that are aligned with my values and what I give a f*ck about.So this book moves from seeming superficial to actually being quite profound and useful. I've realigned many of my values and thought processes in the past six months. The main insight from the cognitive psychologist Ingvard Wilhelmsen was that thoughts are not facts. They are just thoughts. Not reality. ""The subtle art of not giving a f*uck"" nudges me further in the right direction by giving me the insight that pain and frustration is absolutely necessary aspects of getting anywhere and that I have an unreasonable fear of failure.Since I found this useful, it could be that you would to. I wholeheartedly recommend it, despite my initial reservations."

Everyone just can't stop talking about this book, even my friends were whining about this book. I have seen celebrities reading this book. And bookstgramers, they can't have enough of this book so I finally decided to try it. After reading it, I finally got it why everyone is so obsessed about this book.I personally have read so many self-help books but haven't read anything like this book. Most self-help book will tell you to do yoga, be calm, be happy in all situation, you are special, you are right, be certain, say yes to everything, your soul is eternal and so on. Stuff like this is nice to read but it's not pragmatic, and this book tells exactly opposite of that and still makes you improve your self.In the modern fast-paced life you can't say yes to everything and everyone cause if that's the case people will eat you alive, this book tells you a practical way of living life, what you should give a fuck about and what you should not.This book has changed my entire persona of seeing life. All this book says is to find a bigger fuck to give a fuck about. This book also be able to help you if you are having an existential crisis and give you perspective to look at your problems differently.Millennials like me are not very much into reading a book especially a self-help. But the language of this book is such that millennials would actually love to read it. This book hits number 1 in my top 10 of self-help books.So all and all if you are millennial or not, you're having an existential crisis or not, you like a self-help book or not, you give way to much fuck about everything or not at all, in my opinion, everyone should read this book at least once.Detailed Review Link - http://chevusread.blogspot.com/2018/1..."

This read was the outcome of such an expedition. I'm not good at describing what I learned from self-help books☹ so I'm not wasting time trying. Well this book was unique in its execution. There was some strong language, real life stories from prominent people all around the world, and a very very different angle of looking at things, so that you can become happy and content with the life you have.There is no sugar-coating of harsh realities. There are no kind words. This book is a young writer trying to talk some sense into you, what he has come to learn about life! A different style of writing self improvement book.

156,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17142249,Rating 4 out of 5,"في الحقيقة أهرب دومًا من الكتب التي يُصنَع من حولها ضجة ما، وهذا الكتاب تحديدًا أخرجته من حساباتي تمامًا بسبب شهرته التي اكتسبها بعد أن تم تصوير اللاعب المصري محمد صلاح أثناء قراءته للكتاب. زاد على ذلك بعض ردود الفعل السلبية التي أوضحت أن الكتاب لا يستحق الضجة التي حصل عليها. سبب قراءتي للكتاب أخيرًا هو قراءتي لتغريدة لصديق – إن سمح لي بهذا الوصف- يجمعني معه بعض النقاط التي نتفق فيها في هذه الحياة، وهو الأخ العزيز فؤاد الفرحان. كتب في معرض حديثه عن موضوع آخر أن كتاب فن المبالاة مهم وينصح بقراءته. ولأنني أعرف كيف يُفكّر فؤاد فتعجّبت من قوله لكنني كنت مُتأكدّا أن الكتاب بعد هذه التوصية لن يكون مُجرد هراء! وقد كان.كتاب فن اللامبالاة للكاتب مارك مانسون، هو كتاب يُعتبر من كتب تطوير الذات -التي لا أحبها بالمناسبة- لكنه وياللمفارقة على عكس معظم ما تدعوا هذه الكتب إليه! الكاتب – والذي لي عليه تحفّظات كثيرة أخلاقيًا- هو مُجرد شخص يحكي قصة حياته وكيفية خروجه من دوامة مشاكله النفسية أو ��ستهتاره وضياعه، وكيف تحوّل من مجرد فاشل إلى شخص ناجح على الأقل من وجهة نظره، وكيف تقبّل حياته السابقة بأخطائه وانحرافه، حيث رأى أن هذه الأخطاء كان لها دورًا أن تجعل منه شخصًا أفضل. أو كما قال الكاتب بنفسه في نهاية الفصل الأول، "" سيُعلّمك الكتاب كيف تخسر دون أن تُشكّل الخسارة مصدر قلق عليك، وأن تثق بأن من الممكن أن تسقط على ظهرك وتظل بخير رغم ذلك"".يُغيّر الكاتب مفهوم السعادة الدارج، إلى أن السعادة هي حالة مستمرة تتلخص في مواجهة المشاكل وحلها بشكل دائم، وأنها ليست شيء سحري يستطيع تغيير حياتنا. فالسعادة تتطلب نضالاً من أجلها، وهي ثمرة مصارعة المشكلات، ولهذا فأنه يجب علينا أن تختر في الحياة ما تكافح من أجله يُحرّضنا الكاتب في الكتاب ألا نكون أشخصًا استثنائيين، بل على العكس أن نكون أشخاصًا عاديين، وأن نبتعد عن قيم المجتمع السطحية وأن نتبع قِيمًا جيدة غير زائفة، لأن هذا فقط ما يجعلنا استثنائيين وعظماء حتى ولو كنا أصحاب حياة متواضعة اقتصادية. فقبولنا أننا أشخاصًا عاديين هو ما يؤدي بنا إلى السعادة وترك قلق السعي إلى المكانة الدائم. وبأنه يجب أن ندرك بأننا إن لم نكن مُستعدين للفشل، فإننا غير مستعدين للنجاح أصلًا. وأن المهم في النهاية هو ما سنترك للعالم من بعدنا.أعجبني تشبيه الموت في قوله"" لكن الموت بطريقة غريبة هو الضوء الذي يُقاس به ظل معنى الحياة كله. ولولا وجود الموت لبدا لنا كل شيء معدوم الأهمية، ولصارت القيم والمقاييس كلها صفرًا.""أما بخصوص من ينتقد الكتاب، والذين أنكروا على الكاتب -في نقدهم- سرد تجربته لأنها شخصية وغير موضوعية، وهذا حقيقة بالفعل. لكن هذا لا يعني أنها بالضرورة خاطئة. العجيب أن معظم هؤلاء هم أنفسهم من يمدحون تجارب ستيف جوبز أو بيل جيتس على سبيل المثال. وبغض النظر عن أن النجاح العملي ليس دليلًا مؤكدًا على سعادة الشخص أو مصداقيته، لكننا يجب أن ندرك أن مثل هذه التجارب جميعها مجرد تجارب حياتية، نستخلص منها الجيد وما يناسبنا، أو نرى فيها فكرة أو قيمة غابت عن أعيننا. أو قد نجد قيمة لدينا بالفعل، لكن تم صياغتها في تلك التجارب بطريقة أبسط. تمامًا مثلما نقابل أشخاصًا في الحياة مثل صديق أو قريب أو حتى عامل تراه في الشارع، فنستلهم من طريقة تعاملهم مع الحياة شيئًا ينقصنا أو لا نراه.إن الحكمة أو التأملات الفكرية لا نستمدها فقط من أفواه الفلاسفة أو الكُتّاب الكبار المشهورين، أو حتى بناء على أبحاث ودراسات موضوعية، لكن هذا ليس معناه أن نتجاهلها بالطبع، بل هي أساسية جدًا أيضًا بنفس أهمية التجارب الحياتية غير الموضوعية! لماذا؟ لأنها تساعدنا في وضع تلك التجارب الحياتية في إطار موضوعي، فلا نُضخّمها أو نعطيها أكبر من حجمها، ولا نحتقرها فتضيع علينا فرصة إيجاد معنى نستيطع أن نراه بشكل عملي. هذا المزيج مهم جدًا كي لا تكون أحكامنا على الحياة إما أكاديمية جدًا أو عاطفية جدًا.ورغم أن هناك الكثير من المعلومات أو الحقائق أو القيم الموجدة بالكتاب لم تكن جديدة بالنسبة لي حيث كنت أعرفها بالفعل، إلا أنني لا أستطيع تجاهل حقيقة أن الكثير من المحيطين بنا إما أنهم غير محيطين بها، أو أنهم على دراية بها لكنهم يتجاهلونها. وإلا فكيف نُفسّر بأن هناك من يُقدم على فعل سيء وهو على الرغم بدرايته بسوء الفعل، إلا أن ذلك لا يمنعه من ارتكابه!قد لا يناسبك الكتاب أو قد يُناسبك، لا أستطيع ضمان ذلك لكم، لكنني أراه كتابًا جيدّا ومُهمّا كمحاولة للحد من طوفان مواضيع تطوير النفس وزيادة جرعة الإيجابية فيها لدرجة قد تجعل الفرد غير قادر على تحمّل أي صدمة أو معاناة في الحياة. هذا الكتاب يحث على أشياء أصبحت تتقلص من ثقافة جيل الشباب، أشياء مثل تحمّل المسؤولية وتقبّل الألم والخسارة. يحث على عدم الإنسياق وراء الشعور بدور الضحية أو بدور الفاشل، والذي تعززه مواقع التواصل الإجتماعي هذه الأيام.ملحوظة... هناك بعض الأفكار في هذا الكتاب متشابهة جدًا مع ما قرأته لأحمد العسيلي في كتابه المكتوب بالعامية المصرية ""كتاب مالوش اسم"" المنشور في عام 2009 خاصة في الفصول التالية ""عايز إيه؟""، ""السعادة""، ""بيقولوا عليّا إيه؟""، "" كل حاجة صعبة"".نقطة أخيرة... واضح جدًا الجهد الكبير الذي قام به المُترجم الجميل الحارث النبهان، والذي نقّح كتاب ""فن اللامبالاة"" من الأسلوب السوقي والشتائم البذيئة في النسخة الأصلية باللغة الإنجليزية. الترجمة فعلًا رائعة مُميّزة راقية. فشُكرًا للمترجم.أنصح بقراءة الكتاب، ليس ككتابًا عظيمًا... لكن ككتاب قد تجد فيه بعضًا منك!تقييمي 4 من 5رابط المراجعة الصوتية على يوتيوب https://youtu.be/eXA3ZPMplnsرابط المراجعة الصوتية على موقع Soundcloudhttps://soundcloud.com/when_i_read/m9...أحمد فؤاد – 19 حزيران يونيو 2019"
157,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book is about self-improvement guide on how to bear with unpleasing things happen in life.In this book, Mark Manson figure this life as “endless senses of problems”. This book teaches us not to ignore all of the things in life but the most important one. It will teach us to lose and let go. Life may give sh*t to our lives, but in the end, we are still okay. Mark Manson introduces us how to see the world that sometimes we are giving too much f*ck on unimportant things that it is needless. Again, this book is considered not to follow “positivity in life” Mark Manson said “f*ck positivity”. This book helps us to look at problems from a different perspective.""Not giving a fuck doesn't mean being indifferent; it means being comfortable with being different""In the first chapter of the book, Mark Manson describes what it is called “Not Giving a F*ck”. It is just the same with not giving a damn or not giving a shit. It deals with not giving too much care or attention to which unimportant things. It may be a little bit surprising since Mark Manson using impolite words while depicting his views. However, that is the uniqueness of Mark Manson. The first chapter is talking about being success is not a guarantee for one’s to be a better person afterwards. Too much-giving f*ck on standards in which followed by a lot of people that success is all about wealth, popular, expensive car and so on. Nevertheless, this book let us no to give a shit to those standards, yet becoming successful does not make us a better person.Mark Manson states that Happiness is a problem, how it can be a problem?. Happiness can make us feel at ease, but Mark Manson view this thing differently. Mark Manson mentioned in his book “life is essentially an endless series of problems”. As long as we live, we are going to face problems. Pretending that we have no problem is a problem. Accepting those unpleasing happen in our life can be the best way to be happy. Mark Manson added on the 3rd chapter of this book that life may throw us sh*t whoever we are. If huge problems happen in our life, that problem may happen to each person in the past few years, or there is someone facing the same problem too. ""This is why not going a fuck is so key. This is why it's going to save the world it by accepting that the world is totally fucked up and that's all right, because it's always been that way, and always be.""Mark Manson expresses his thoughts in straightforward with some of his own experiences. He also added some stories from Charles Bukowski, William James, and Dave Mustaine. Along with analogies he presented in this book can make the reader hum to themself “Yes, I do agree with that”. In a nutshell, this book suits for people who seek for happiness through simplicity in life."

But for me that was exactly where it went wrong. I want books that make me feel things, that i think about throughout the day, that make my head spin, that change my perspective by making me rethink aspects of my life. This was exactly the opposite of that - it handed all the thinking on a silver plate, required NO efforts from you, I didn’t even need to think while reading.

Trovate questo e altri libri che rileggo periodicamente qui: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JSzA...PS: per quelli a cui possa interessare, da questa settimana ricominciano i video - Sabato alle 14Cià---Recensione dell'anno scorso: Posso dire che consigliavo questo libro in giro prima che lo facesse Fedez? Posso?Mi sfogo qui: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdRcE...---Recensione di due anni fa: I think this is the 4th year in a row that this happens. I had a drink with 2 old friends that I originally met in 2015.One is called Mark and the other one is a superhero called Disappointment Panda. We had a couple of Burritos each, then we started drinking Margaritas. In the meantime, we all talked a lot. Well, technically, they talked, I have listened what they had to tell. They did examine many cool subjects, such as music (talking about Megadeth and Beatles), the story of Buddha, and some wrapped up wisdom quoting things like Shakespeare and OCD. We had a lot of fun indeed. I think the literary salons Baudelaire used to hangout at, where he used to smoke pot and probably have acids, must have been similar to the experience I had, drugs aside.Oh right, I should probably warn you that after three or four Margaritas, severe bad humor was brought up at some point, but damn, it was so funny.While I was listening, I realized that they were actually saying the same shit they did last year, and the year earlier, and also the first year I met them.And I also realize that the Panda was a little bit out of shape to be an actual superhero. His belly was literary coming out of the strange T-shirt he was wearing. As I said, just a little bit out of shape. But I got to admit he did has some valid points, though he seemed to me more of an Antihero rather than a Hero. But hey, rise your hand if you think that Kick Ass was cooler than Superman (I do). At some point the Panda said to Mark “Life is essentially an endless series of problems, Mark. The solution to one problem is merely the creation of the next one”. After another Margarita, he put on the table something along these lines: “Don’t hope for a life without problems, there’s no such thing. Instead, hope for a life full of good problems”. If that doesn’t sound like some heavy philosophy shit, I don’t know if this can really help you.I gotta tell you, Mark happens to be some badass philosopher too, and I have realized that pretty soon. One of my favourite quote is when he said “When we force ourselves to stay positive at all times, we deny the existence of our life’s problems. And when we deny our problems, we rob ourselves of the change to solve them and generate happiness. Problems add a sense of meaning and importance to our life. Thus to duck our problems is to lead a meaningless (even if supposedly pleasant) existence” while waving with his hand holding his second Margaritas.But when they started talking about values and responsabilities, is where I did realize something. That even though they were saying the same stuff of the last years without any doubt, I was sure listening to them in a different way. I was comparing what I was listening to my past year, and that, in a way, has always been different. And that’s the reason why I like to meet these guys every 1st of the Year. Because every time I grasp insights and realizations that slipped away from my hands without even noticing it. And even though doing this shit every year may sounds crazy or something, I don’t really give a fuck.Happy New Year!"

It didn't change much from my earlier thoughts, which were along the lines of:1. If you don't have social media, then it's not really applicable. For example, the comparisons people apparently make to others' lives viewing their feeds or mindlessly scrolling and not actually living, or not enjoying what they have because they're always looking at what others have on social media. I personally dislike social media and the negativity it can cause so I'm glad to be off it (besides for books) and think that for those who do have it, this could be useful messaging. 2. The comments throughout the book and statements honestly seem just baseless and formed by personal opinion or experience. It is not a book that would, in my opinion, equally apply to all people or work for all people. It seemed as though it would be a psychological perspective, but I get the feeling (and admittedly haven't researched this) that the author has no such training or experience. 3. It is more often than not directed a bit more to negative, self absorbed or entitled people... not the general population. There was one positive I took out of this book and that was the discussion on a feedback loop and how in the past, apparently, people just went 'I feel s***, ok' and never thought more into it, were just ok with their feelings and knew the next day could be better. That's important because everyone can have bad days and that's totally ok, but often people are trying to find deeper meaning to it. I don't know anyone who I would personally recommend this book to.ETA: read by audiobook so no rating. "

Sadly, the word f*ck (which is my fav curse word when used sparingly and with great timing for comic effect in RL) is used so much that the book becomes hard to read. The author makes some good points (though these same points have been made by Buddha,Confucius, Plato, Proust, etc), but there's bad mixed in. Stuff like how the 80 yo woman has nothing to care about but grocery coupons. My Great Aunt Jessie is eighty-eight, lives alone, volunteered to call people for the DNC last election, etc. She'd have a lot to say about someone assuming old means nothing left to care about.I did notice that I have come to some of the same conclusions as the author. He's ahead of the game on some of the things that I had to reach fifty to realize on my own. He's right that you have to pick what you are going to care and not care about. Idk. There's treasure in this book to be mined. I just think there are, for me at least, better and more accessible philosophy & happy life books elsewhere. Besides, this author acts like when you reach eighty, you might as well disappear as you have nothing to live for anymore which is insane and erroneous. "

Some of his past life experiences just seemed like they were exaggerated just so he could pass a point. In many parts of his book, I felt like he was so repetitive I was like ""fuck dude stop talking about fucking values"" and it was like I was losing the point at some point.

It is divided into nine chapters. The first four chapters explains why the book is created. The last five chapters elaborate the counter-intuitive values that we need to practice every day. I love how the author begins each chapter with a story. After each story comes these new insights that are linked to psychology. IMPORTANT NOTE: I strongly recommend this to all psych majors whether you work in a clinical, business or educational setting.Chapter 4 is my favorite. It discusses about the value of suffering. It makes me realize that ""When we force ourselves to stay positive at all times, we deny the existence of our life's problems.

We suffer for the simple reason that suffering is biologically useful. We have evolved to always live with a certain degree of dissatisfaction and insecurity because it’s the mildly dissatisfied and insecure creature that’s going to do the most work to innovate and survive. And pain, as much as we hate it, is useful. Pain is what teaches us what to pay attention to when we're careless. It helps show us what's good for us versus what's bad for us. It helps us understand and adhere to our own limitations. The key to living a good life is not giving a fuck about more things, but rather, giving a fuck only about the things that align with your personal goals. If you find yourself consistently giving too many fucks about trivial shit that bothers you—your ex-boyfriend’s new Facebook picture, how quickly the batteries die in the TV remote, missing out on yet another two-for-one sale on hand sanitizer—chances are you don’t have much going on in your life to give a legitimate fuck about.

Maybe because that book is more academically research. Mark talked a lot about philosophy, history, and many subjects. On the other hand, this book is mostly about Mark's experience. Don't get me wrong, i enjoyed it too. He's been through a lot, so i guess that's where he got the life lesson for this book.This book is more relaxed, and also had more profanity words. The f word appeared in almost sentences (in chapter 1). But i like it and the profanity didn't disturb me at all. His sentences also really describing me. ""Most of us struggle throughout our lives by giving too many fucks in situations where fucks do not deserve to be given.""After a few chapters, he seemed more serious. I really liked when he told his story about his experienced in visiting 55 countries, meeting stranger, learning their culture then his realisation that his experiences is meaningless compared to his other friends that remains in one place, settle down, build a family and committed to only one partner. As a young adult, one of my dream is to visited every country around the world. But perhaps, it wouldn't make me happy in the end."

It's a book to guide your life for better, don't necessarily counters all the socially unacceptable things that you do, tells you that it's ok to be not ok and how to be that black sheep among herd of millions other sheep. The most important lesson that it teaches is, how not to give unnecessary f*cks to every little and big thing you encounter in your life, imbibe so or keep that frown on forever!It's exactly what you need to read in order to realize what have you been doing all your life was not all a sin, but at the same time how can you aid your life with wisdom that will help you live better, feel more alive, in all the spheres of life.Highly recommended to one and all on planet earth and beyond(If life and English exists!)."

And how much I actually enjoyed it, even though there are some hard things you need to accept in this book to allow it to be effective.I like Manson's straight talking, no BS style. He lays it out for you in simple terms, and then tells you that you need to get over yourself if you want to be happy. That nobody is happy all the time, and that you will always have problems. It just depends on what you choose to worry about that defines you. People who allow themselves to worry or care about every tiny little injustice against them, every petty occurrence or unimportant slight are never going to be happy. Our problems are essentially what define us, and it's how we deal with those problems, and cast aside the ones that don't really matter, that make us content human beings. You get to decide how you want to feel about everything that happens to you. Some things may not be your fault, but your reaction is always your responsibility. Once you own your failures and the fact that you aren't special, that life doesn't have some hidden meaning or grand final achievement, then you can really start living and embrace the problems and annoyances of every day life. I have a feeling that I'm going to be thinking about this book for a while, and working hard to put Manson's advice to good use. It's sound advice, but definitely not something that's going to be easy to put into practice."

El esquema general del libro es que el autor explica una serie de teorías que se basan en experiencias personales y en ejemplos famosos. El libro en sí es entretenido, pero el autor no es un profesional de psicología que ayude a los demás a sentirse mejor con su vida. Es una especie de libro de autoayuda, pero con comentarios jocosos del autor y experiencias propias que cuenta sin ninguna vergüenza.Como no tengo en si una base con que compararlo y decir que me gusto y que no les dejare aquí unas de las frases que yo considero que mas me gustaron y a las cuales me sentí más identificada“Nunca serias feliz si continúas buscando en que consiste la felicidad.

Solo porque algo se siente mal no significa que sea malo”“Lo que eres se define por lo que estás dispuesto a luchar”“Prioriza mejor tus valores, elegí mejores cosas a las que darles atención. Porque cuando lo haces, tienes mejores problemas, y cuando tienes mejores problemas tienes una mejor vida”“No existe tal cosa que te importe todo un carajo. Es imposible, a todos nos tiene que importar algo, que te importe un carajo todo es darle importancia a algo ¿A que elegimos darle importancia?”“La mejora de cualquier habilidad se basa en miles de pequeños fracasos y la magnitud de tu éxito se sustenta en el numero de veces que fracasaste en algo. Si alguien es mejor que tu en algo entonces es probable que lo sea porque ha fallado más veces que tú.

This is an insightful little book that slapped me with some hard truths. I’m so glad that I read this, because I needed to hear this advice. Mark Manson had me asking myself a lot of questions and taking a step back to observe my own thoughts and behaviors. Some of what I learned is personal and occur in the sections, “Self-Awareness Onion”, “There is No ‘How’”, “Manson’s Law of Avoidance”, and “The ‘Do Something’ Principle”. I flagged so many parts of this book that I could easily quote half of it, just because he said things so eloquently and not all of those quotes contain the f-bomb. He gives great real-life examples dealing with former rock star celebrities, Picasso, and World War II survivors. Also, he includes some findings from psychologists that I think adds depth to the book. There's also a great section called ""Boundaries"" that deals with toxic relationships. Happiness doesn’t come from avoiding problems it comes from solving them. He says there are two ways to fuck this up: denial and a victim mentality. I think I have fallen into both traps at various points in my life. Sometimes I still do, which is one of the things I want to fix. We’ve all denied something in life, but if we’re honest with ourselves, denying our problems only makes us insecure and delusional. Most of us have blamed others for our problems or blame them for not fixing them, but all it does is makes us angry and helpless. We need a healthy dose of personal accountability. One of the parts of the book that resonated with me was when Mark Manson talked about people who overidentify with their emotions. They justify their actions by saying things like It felt right and those sorts of things. Since emotions never lasts, we’re always pursuing “something else” and therefore, we're never satisfied.
”Decision-making based on emotional intuition, without the aid of reason to keep it in line, pretty much always sucks.”
Another part that really struck me was about determining what you want out of life. Mark asks, “What are you willing to struggle for?” I don’t think I’ve ever asked myself that whenever I’m trying to determine which of my many, many dreams I want to actively pursue. We all want a perfect body, but the real determining factor is whether we’re willing to deal with the struggles of calculating our macronutrients and going to the gym every day. Many of us want to become published authors and hopefully make it to the bestseller list. In this case, the question is whether we’re willing to sit in front of our computers for hours in the evening to write our novels after spending eight hours at our 9-to-5 job. Are we willing to struggle through the crappy writing phase that every writer experiences in order to get to the polished, professional writing phase? If we're not willing to struggle for our dreams, then we don't really want them.I loved the section about the sense of entitlement. I think we all know people like this. They think they deserve certain things in life without actually earning it. They think they deserve fame and fortune and expect it to magically show up on their doorsteps. They have fake self-confidence and fool themselves into believing they’re achieving something even when they’re not.Sometimes Mark will spin a phrase that makes a lot of sense, but also makes me laugh.
”All of this ‘every person can be extraordinary and achieve greatness’ stuff is basically just jerking off your ego. It’s a message that tastes good going down, but in reality is nothing more than empty calories that make you emotionally fat and bloated, the proverbial Big Mac for your heart and your brain.”
Overall, this was an eye-opening book that was also informative and entertaining. It’s not a dry, fluffy, bullshit self-help book that will make you feel all warm and fuzzy. It’s more of an in-your-face reality check and I loved it. This is a book that’s worth buying, highlighting, and rereading.

222,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61870773-rida-imran,Rating 1 out of 5," We suffer for the simple reason that suffering is biologically useful. It is nature’s preferred agent for inspiring change. We have evolved to always live with a certain degree of dissatisfaction and insecurity, because it’s the mildly dissatisfied and insecure creature that’s going to do the most work to innovate and survive. We are wired to become dissatisfied with whatever we have and satisfied by only what we do not have. This constant dissatisfaction has kept our species fighting and striving, building and conquering. So no—our own pain and misery aren’t a bug of human evolution; they’re a feature. So I try to avoid self help books; but everyone kept on recommending this to me; people that I know in real life that don't read were like ""how calm if you read books you haven't read this yet"" ; ""I'm sure this will become your new favourite"" etc. I don't read every single book; and this did not become my favourite.So I guess this book was okay. Maybe self helps are meant to be like this? I have no idea. I liked the real like examples and metrics part.I found the book really repetitious. The idea that if we keep pursuing more and more positivity will basically make us less and less satisfied was repeated so many times in so many different ways..His point of view seemed somewhat privileged and misogynistic. Take into example how he talks about false memory; I'm sure he would've found other examples; in fact he could've showed exactly this one too if in the end of it he were to mention that while false memory is common it should not blamed upon always and the victim should be listened to. Then there's the way he talked about self awareness. He describes a saver and victim relationship.  The victim creates more and more problems to solve—not because additional real problems exist, but because it gets her the attention and affection she craves. The saver solves and solves—not because she actually cares about the problems, but because she believes she must fix others’ problems in order to deserve attention and affection for herself. In both cases, the intentions are selfish and conditional and therefore self-sabotaging, and genuine love is rarely experienced.The victim creates more and more problems to solve—not because additional real problems exist, but because it gets her the attention and affection she craves.

In both cases, the intentions are selfish and conditional and therefore self-sabotaging, and genuine love is rarely experienced. If you were too look at his statements in broader light then you'd see that this can be problematic. Research shows that once one is able to provide for basic physical needs (food, shelter, and so on), the correlation between happiness and worldly success quickly approaches zero. So if you’re starving and living on the street in the middle of India, an extra ten thousand dollars a year would affect your happiness a lot. But if you’re sitting pretty in the middle class in a developed country, an extra ten thousand dollars per year won’t affect anything much—meaning that you’re killing yourself working overtime and weekends for basically nothing. What no. Unless we're in the really rich class that money does mean a lot even if we're not beggars. My family has shelter, food and other basic necessities but guess what college and university fees? So yeah those extra hours and everything count for us too."

Also, the title is definitely one that drew my attention. I don't think I'd have picked this up otherwise. Why? Because I hate self-help books. Like, truly hate them. I find them a waste of time, and think they are just an easy way out for average non-skilled writers, to publish books. I don't believe that you need a ""book"" to help you find happiness and positivity and peace in your life. Your whole life is a series of experiences, good and bad, you have to fail to experience success, and what one person experiences or gets out of a situation, is completely different than what another would. No two people will ever get the same result or outcome, so these books - they're a waste of time. That's another reason why I don't believe in life-coaching either. It's just another, cooler way, of calling yourself a therapist but without all the hard work and degrees that come with it - so really, you're a fraud. No offence to life coaches. So what does Mark Manson bring to the table? Nothing new. Everything he writes is common sense, except he likes to add a bunch of curse words to make it sound more exciting and 'raw', you know? Nothing revolutionary presented. In fact, it really frustrated me when I read that he's some rich white privileged boy that comes from a very well-off family, because the whole book reeks of how he carelessly lived his twenties and how much he's learned from his really stupid experiences. His book is based on a handful of good ideas that he's probably taken from a few self-help books that he's read himself and different philosophies and religions, mainly Buddhism. He makes one point, and then proceeds to be extremely repetitive telling us one example or story after another to justify this point he's trying to make. Most examples were ones I've heard or read about before, like the Metallica story followed by the Beatles story, and then of course, he has to end the chapter with a story from his own personal experience to wrap it up. What you end up getting is one paragraph to start out the chapter that actually fully discusses the point he's making, followed by 20+ pages of stories to back up this point. A waste of time. Problem is, I started out really liking the book. The introduction to the book was actually interesting and raised my expectations on how this book will unfold. Sadly, it ended up being another one of those self-help preachy books. He should stick to blogging. I would skip it."

I just came across a movie on Letterboxd titled the same as the book, and the blurb said that it starred Mark Mason. I was intrigued a bit, so I thought of checking it out, thinking that maybe it is like a 97-minute synopsis of the book. It was and also was not. There are some things to appreciate concerning the filmmaking of the documentary, but it also got on my nerves. So, I turned off my laptop and picked up my Kindle for the ebook.And it still did not work for me. It always felt like the author was trying freaking hard to portray a carefree, stoic persona who does not literally give a fuck about the world. Well, it should go without saying, but whenever you feel that the author is trying very hard, that is bad. People need to understand that overusing a single terminology does not make it impactful but makes others think it is just one of your peculiar mannerisms.Not to say that I do not agree with any of the pointers in the book. Manson does a decent job of taking up some age-old pearls of wisdom and refining them in a way he must have thought would be more appealing to the gen-z. Maybe, it is appealing to most of them, but I will pick  Robin Sharma any day.A bit of 'unsolicited' rant: I remember one of my classmates said that he would write a book titled 'Fuck ____' (an Indian author). When I asked him about the content, he said he was going to write ""Fuck fuck fuck fuck ..."" for 200+ pages. Not exaggerating, but why am I reminded of that stupid incident(?) when I was reading this book? Also, you know what you do when someone is speaking in front of you on a subject you're only vaguely interested in, but the way of speaking is boring you. Then you observe the speaker saying a particular word in every sentence, so you start counting how many times he says the word. I know I did. Our professor in Linear Algebra used to say the word 'here' a lot. One day, I just yawned and counted how many times he said the word in 10 minutes. He did over 45 times (coincidentally, that yawning earned me 45 on a paper of 100FM, the lowest in the class, but it didn't take away the fun I had in those 10 minutes :)) I guess he would have loved this book and could have found it meaningful and relatable."

227,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5875291-tim,Rating 5 out of 5,"There's no new overarching lessons in life. It doesn't seem that way. Sure the more you focus in on the details there might be at the level of things that ultimately don't matter. But what Manson is saying here in such a profound way is a different way of saying what all great moral traditions have always said at their core - life is short, death is certain and we need to focus on the important stuff. What the important stuff is to can really only be determined clearly when we have the courage to accept death. Our vision will be hazy until then. So this is the subtle art of not giving a fuck, it's not giving a fuck about superficial shit. This is all said here in a very readable way, but you can find the same thing in everything from scriptures to the mystics to philosophy and psychology. It's still a great read though and you can see the growth in his mentality from Models: Attract Women through Honesty to this one."

I looked for reviews here on Goodreads but there seem to be only ratings.... it's not funny. It is, for the most part, banal. Some of the advice is not unsound, but seems directed at himself. He's fond of the narcissistic and self-important as examples--as he portrays himself 'in his youth'. I wondered whether any women had read the manuscript and given him some advice. A guy not beating you is not a high bar for a good guy (this comes up a few times). His sexual prowess (as a self-deprecating cautionary tale) comes up A LOT. His overuse of the f-word comes across not as cool and colloquial, but as a lack of language ability. It's a bit exhausting. The book is simplistic in both levels of thought and expression. So why read it? Between the press on the NY Times and NPR, I just thought it had to get better."

Вони тепер екзистенційні, духовні. У нас так багато хотілок і так багато можливостей, що ми вже й не знаємо, чого насправді прагнути.”“Бажання мати більше позитивного досвіду саме по собі - негативний досвід. І, парадоксально, прийняття власного негативного досвіду - позитивний досвід.”“Закон протилежного зусилля недарма має таку назву: якщо ви перестаєте капець як хотіти чогось, усе починає відбуватися навпаки. Якщо гнатися за позитивом - це негатив, то гонитва за негативом породжує позитив.”“Усі справді важливі речі в житті досягаються через проживання повʼязаного з ним негативного досвіду. Будь-яка спроба втекти від негативу, уникнути його, стримати, затюкати - тільки породжує гірше.”“Витонченість 1. Забивати - не означає бути байдужим.

Якщо цього навчитися, настає те, що я називаю “практичним просвітленням”.”“Щастя приходить коли розвʼязуєш проблеми.”“Проблеми - це константа життя.”“Проблеми ніколи не припиняються; вони лише змінюють одна одну і переходять на вищий рівень складності.”“Для щастя нам потрібно щось розвʼязувати. Отже, щастя - це дія, діяльність, а не якась безформна штука, яка звалюється вам на голову, і не секрет, який ви відкриєте, прочитавши статтю …”“Щастя - це постійна робота, бо розвʼязання проблеми - це постійна робота. Розвʼязання проблем нинішніх стане підвалиною для проблем завтрашніх і так далі. Справжнє щастя приходить тоді, коли ви маєте проблеми, які вам подобається мати і подобається розвʼязувати.”“Усе, що ми здобуваємо, потребує від нас жертви.

Відповідальність походить від вибору, який ви робите зараз, щомиті щодня.”“Людський розум - це мішанина неточностей.

Здатність розглянути й оцінити різні цінності, не обовʼязково приймаючи їх, - це, можливо, найважливіше вміння, завдяки якому можна змінити своє життя й надати йому нового сенсу.”“якщо вам здається, що ви протистоїте цілому світові, можливо, ви просто протистоїте самому собі.”“Найкращі результати в будь-якій справі досягаютья ціною тисячі дрібних поразок. І велич вашого успіху можна оцінити лише за тим, скільки разів ви в цій справі зазнали невдач. Якщо хтось усіє щось робити краще за вас, значить, він облажався більше разів, ніж ви.

Якщо ми не готові зазнати поразки, значить, не готові зазнати й успіху.”“Подорож - це чудовий шлях до саморозвитку.”“Різниця між життєздатними й нежиттєздатними стосунками зводиться до двох речей: 1) наскільки кожна людина в цих стосунках готова брати на себе відповідальність і 2) готовність одного партнера заперечити або зустріти заперечення з боку другого.”“В отруйних стосунках завжди є інь і янь: є жертва і рятівник, той, хто розпалює суперечки, бо завжди цьому відчуває власну важливість, і той, хто гасить суперечки, бо завдяки цьому відчуває власну важливість. Ці два типи людей притягуються одне до одного, і зрештою опиняються разом. Їхні патології ідеально поєднуються.”“Якщо жерства по-справжньому кохає рятівника, вона має сказати йому: “Знаєш, це моя проблема, ти не мусиш розвʼязувати її за мене. Просто підтримай мене, поки я розвʼязуватиму її самотужки”. Це буде справжній прояв кохання: узяти відповідальність за власні проблеми і не змушувати партнера відповідати за них.”“Для жертв найважче в житті - тримати у власних руках відповідальність за свої проблеми. Усе життя вони вірили, що хтось відповідає за їхню долю. І зробити перший крок у напрямку власної відповідальності дуже страшно.”“для рятівників найважче - припинити брати відповідальність за проблеми інших людей. вони все життя вважали, що їх цінують і люблять тільки тоді, коли вони рятують інших, тому відмовитися від рятування - для них так само страшний крок.”“Вчинки, зроблені з любовʼю, істинні тільки тоді, коли здійснюються без додаткових умов і очікувань.”“Людям буває важко розрізнити, де щось зроблено під примусом обовʼязку, а де - добровільно. Ось вам лакмусовий папірець: запитайте себе: “Як зміняться наші сосунки, якщо я не зроблю цього?”. І ще запитайте: “Якби мій партнер відмовився робити щось, чого мені хочеться, як зміняться наші стосунки?””“в моїх стосунках чесність важливіша за гарний настрій”“Довіра - найважливіший складник у будь-яких стосунках із тієї простої причини, що без довіри состунки втрачають сенс.”“що більше варіантів нам пропонується, то менше задоволення ми отримаємо від обраного, бо нам не дають спокою варіанти, яких ми не обрали.”“Ернест Беккер … його книжка “Заперечення смерті” отримала Пулітцерівську премію з публіцистики і стала однією з найвпливовіших інтелектуальних праць XX століття.”“Дві головні тези автора “Заперечення смерті” такі. 1. Унікальність людини в тому, що вона - єдина тварина, яка може осмислювати себе й думати про себе абстрактно… 2. Друга Беккерова теза заснована на припущенні, що кожна людина має дві “особи”. Перша - фізична, та, що їсть, спить, хропе і пукає. Друга - абстрактна: наша ідентичність, як ми бачимо самих себе.”“щоб компенсувати наш страх невідворотної втрати нашої фізичної особи, ми намагаємося так збудувати особу абстрактну, аби вона стала бесмертною… Беккер називав ці зусилля “проектами безсмертя”, проектами, завдяки яким наші абстрактні особи переживуть фізичну смерть.”“наші проекти безсмертя - це наші цінності. Вони стають барометрами сенсу і вартості нашого життя.”“Смерть - це погано, але її не уникнути.”Як навчитися швидко читати (промо-лінк)"
241,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/762235-marcus,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is a book about self-awareness. What Mark Manson would probably tell you, and he’d probably be right, is that you don’t have enough.“Self-awareness is like an onion. There are multiple layers to it, and the more you peel them back, the more likely you’re going to start crying at inappropriate times.” He describes three layers of the self-awareness onion: 1. A simple understanding of your emotions. 2. The ability to ask why you feel an emotion. 3. Personal values which determine how you measure yourself and those around you. Personal values define success and failure. This last level he says is the hardest to get to and is “full of f*cking tears.” But it’s the most important because “our values determine the nature of our problems, and the nature of our problems determines the quality of our lives.”“Everything we think and feel about a situation ultimately comes back to how valuable we perceive it to be.” And “What is objectively true about your situation is not as important as how you come to see the situation, how you choose to measure it and value it.”There’s a lot of wisdom there if you’re ready for it.As you might have guessed by now, the title isn’t really descriptive of the book. Mark, in fact, gives lots of f**ks, they’re just about the things that are in line with the values that he’s determined are worth caring about which are:1. Radical responsibility. You don’t control everything that happens to you, but you’re responsible for it.2. Uncertainty - realizing you’re ignorant and need to constantly reevaluate what you believe.3. Willingness to fail and recognize your own flaws.4. The ability to be rejected and to reject others when their values don’t align with yours.5. Contemplation of your own mortality for the purpose of keeping perspective.All five of these values are united by one theme: recognition of our incredible propensity for self-deception.We tell ourselves all kinds of stuff: It’s not my responsibility. I have no problems! My problems are the worst ever. I’m special and unique. The world owes me something. I’m going to live forever. I can’t help how I feel, I’m the victim here. I’m going to be the greatest ever. It goes on and on.Recognizing the self-deception we so willingly engage in and reframing it in context of our chosen values is the main message of the book. It’s a tough message and it’s easy to miss the gravity of it because, as Manson’s Law says “The more something threatens your identity, the more you will avoid it.”You probably won’t read this for the same reasons I almost didn’t. First there’s the hyperbolical title, the fact that Manson is just a blogger and because it’s a self-help book that, like most self-help books, says it’s different from all the others. Maybe you won't like the casual tone or the humor which sometimes feels a little forced. It’d be easy to pass up for those reasons, but you’d be missing out. It’s a short, informal book, but it’s is anything but shallow."

""Who you are is defined by what you’re willing to struggle for.""
I didn't know anything about this book before picking it up and I feel like had I known that Mark Manson calls himself a superstar blogger, I would have had second thoughts. But instead the girl who doesn't like self-help books ended up reading another one. A catchy title isn't enough to win me over, but Manson has got some things about life figured out. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck in a way tries to disillusion you by making clear from the beginning that no matter how you live your life, you will always struggle. You will never reach the point of an equilibrium, where you spend your days with a cocktail on a beach being free of all worries and doubts. And thank God for that! 
""Ironically, this fixation on the positive - on what's better, what's superior - only serve to remind us over and over again what we are not, of what we lack, of what we should have been but failed to be. After all, no truly happy person feels the need to stand in front of a mirror and recite that she's happy. She just is.""
What is the key to something considered a good life is choosing your struggles or to say it in Manson's words: it's not about not giving a fuck, it's about giving a fuck about only what is important. It is part of human nature to care and to solve problems we perceive in our lives, so it is all about enjoying the fight. And while we can't control everything that happens to us, our reactions and responses to it are our full responsibility. I don't feel like this book taught me anything I didn't know already, but sometimes it is nice to hear ideas phrased by someone else. The purposefully provoking and vulgar language didn't really do anything for me, I neither minded nor was impressed by it, but I guess a publisher likes a catchy title and a reader feels less intimidated by a nonchalant speaking manner. There is something about Mark Manson that didn't quite warm up to me. He talks about entitlement, how feeling entitled is basically the beginning of a vicious cycle of creating problems, but at the same time he does come across as someone who thinks he's in a position to teach the world his great revelations, which are mainly things that have been said before. I would probably still recommend this to notorious over-thinkers, obsessive worriers and just people who stress a lot, because this might give you a bit affirmation that there isn't anything about life you have got wrong."

sooo
 very wrong. (Cue Bad to the Bone) This book is seasoned with just the right amount of naughty words to make a girl like me smile and take notice of the point being made. The first few chapters are the best chapters though they were the hardest to read on account of all the fist pumping I was doing. I mean who wouldn’t fist pump after being told to stop giving a flying French door about things that don’t matter? Yes, I just used flying French door instead of a naughty word because substituting naughty words with silly words can be just as fun. It’s a like a striptease show, is she going to say it now? Nope…maybe now?? Not a chance…okay right now?!?!I would totally recommend this book as the best self-help book I have read so far. It speaks in a language that is easy to relate to and its message is basic and attainable. The only tricky part is actually sticking with the life changes it proposes. Saying you don’t give a fudgesicle and actually not giving one is two different things. The guilt (which is something he addresses in this book) can totally convince you otherwise, especially when you are dealing with someone you love or a situation where the not giving a flip can possibly hurt you down the road. Which is actually another thing he addresses, the not worrying about the later what-if that might not even happen.You know, I could give a crap and go into more detail trying to pimp this book out or you could just go read the fucking book already.

244,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2976142-thomas-edmund,Rating 4 out of 5,"The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F, (possibly ironically) is quite hard to review.I jokingly said in an update that the phrase ""giving a F"" was somewhat overused in the first chapter/introduction - oddly that almost seemed like a bait and switch by Manson. Not necessarily a bad one, but the book would probably be a lot more accurately titled ""The Subtle Art of Giving a F About the Right Things."" Which is an absolutely fine thesis, and maybe I'm being a little pedantic, although I think my issue is that I'm a little anti books with flashy titles that end up just being generic life-advice regardless of the theme.Nonetheless Manson's book is actually very good, he manages to dance across a line of easy-to-read accessible information that still delved quite deep. I particularly liked chapter 6 ""You're Wrong About Everything"" it seemed the most powerful, close to the original point and imparted the most wisdom. At times the content seemed a little cliche, I've read far more complaints about these so called soft millennials then actually met any, and also many of the personal anecdotes started to feel like humble-brags rather than content that is actually useful. Ultimately though I think this is a GOOD book if anything Manson provides a few points for consideration, and I imagine for those who need a more irreverent self-help sort of book this is the perfect match.

I've read more of these books than is probably good for me over the years. My conclusion is that how much I like a book of this type has as much to do with what I need to hear at the present moment. You can come across the most amazing book, but if you're not in the right space it flies right by you. Sometimes a book you remember as being amazing is flat and trite on second reading, then, a decade later, is amazing again. So this book hit me at exactly the right time. Mark is a funny writer, and the book moves a long at a light clip. It has a deceptively light touch, given that I felt like underlining 75% of the book. Your mileage may vary, but I got a ton out of this one."

I docked it a star bc there is some white privilege going on that took me right out of the book for a moment. The author complains about how college professors get punished when they suggest that maybe certain Halloween costumes aren’t that offensive. I’m presuming the costumes he was referring to, per national news stories of the last few years, are those that imitate or target POC. It’s real easy to imagine what kinda of costumes, and yes they are fucking offensive, and thinking otherwise puts you in the “You Are So White” category. Because, see, racism is one of the things I give a fuck about, and racism necessarily includes racist microaggressions. "

The small section on OCD actually really spoke to me (for those of you who don't know, I have OCD which in itself is a hard thing to admit for me). This book has definitely given me a newer perspective and I hope to be able to implement these values and this perspective into my life more.

253,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/85543627-justin-pickett,Rating 3 out of 5,"I’m glad I read this; it is very helpful. Buried underneath the meaningless filler and frequent obnoxiousness that fills much of the book, are some very important points about life that I need to remember. There are also several valuable discussions of the lives and experiences of interesting people (e.g., Dave Mustaine, Earnest Becker). The points I need to remember and incorporate into my life are:1) You can’t let everything upset you. You can’t let your emotions go crazy about everything. You can’t do something about everything. You can’t fix everything that is wrong in the world. Your time, emotions, and life are all limited. “You are going to die one day … and in the short amount of time between here and there you have a limited amount of fucks to give.” 2) Because one of the hardest parts of accomplishing any goal or project is starting, the best way to get almost anything done is to just start doing something related to it, even if what you begin with is the easiest or simplest part of the task. This is the “do something principle”:“Action isn’t just the effect of motivation, it’s also the cause of it.” 3) Carefully choose your own metric for measuring success, making sure that it is strongly reflective of your underlying value system. The same objective “achievements” in life can be disappointing, exciting, or entirely irrelevant to your feelings depending on the metric you use. 4) What makes us who we are in life, what gives us a sense of self, are the choices that we make. That is, our identity largely comes from us exercising agency in a committal way: “Absolute freedom, by itself, means nothing … Ultimately, the only way to achieve meaning and a sense of importance in one’s life is through a rejection of alternatives, a narrowing of freedom, a choice of commitment to one place, one belief, or (gulp) one person.” 5) Because happiness is best conceptualized as an ongoing activity, one of the keys to it is action—specifically, identifying the “problems” that matter to you (given your chosen values) and that are actually solvable, and then doing something about them.  “Happiness comes from solving problems.” 6) A great way to think about emotions, and to determine if they are helpful or harmful, is to remember their original biological purpose. If the emotions you feel (either their type or intensity) aren’t consistent with that purpose, you probably need to control them. “Emotions are simply biological signals designed to nudge you in the direction of beneficial change.” "

When I pulled The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck out of my “it’s time to review these books, Kenzie” bag I kind of wanted to scream “but I’m not ready.” Deep breaths. I can do this. It’s hard to explain exactly why this book matters so much to me. Let’s start with the fact that I’ve read it twice in six months.When I got back from China I was pretty screwed up emotionally. I had spent the year prior to China hiding in my house, sometimes working on my Master’s degree, sometimes just hiding but overall feeling completely worthless. I had panic attacks just because I was in WalMart. So I decided to go to China and teach children and teenagers. It was definitely a jump in feet first kind of move. I failed and I triumphed, but I never really felt better. Then I found tumors in my thyroid. Even if they are cancerous (we won’t know if mine are until a week or two after the surgery which is set for Oct 7th) Thyroid cancer is often a “simple fix.” It’s generally considered the cancer you want to get if you have to have cancer at all. But that doesn’t really make anyone feel better when they feel worthless and they’re halfway around the globe and trying to understand the cultural differences between America and China regarding cancer and hospitals. These tumors caused my husband and I to have to move home, but it wasn’t an easy decision.My husband, while I had been at home working on my Master’s/trying to remember why it was necessary for me to breathe, was working in the worst school in the state of Texas and feeling equally worthless but had the lovely addition of angry inner-city teenagers threatening him every day. In China though, my husband loved his job. It was easily the best job for him, he was teaching ESL and excelling at every part of it. And I had to say, “well let’s quit this awesome job and head back to that godawful place we just left that made us both hate ourselves and our lives.” Basically, I felt like shit. At one point I asked if he shouldn’t just stay in China and maybe I could get the surgery and come back. Keep in mind I haven’t slept alone in more than seven years. He said no and we came back to the states together (give or take a four day stay in a Japanese hospital because he got a heart infection that nearly killed him and is the only reason I’ve accepted that leaving China was necessary for both of us). I was either going to give up on life or I was going to learn to calm the hell down. Enter The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck.I’ve never felt so calm. Like I realized for the first time that these tiny decisions really don’t fucking matter. I used to agonize over everything from outfits to food choices. Reading this book forced me to accept that I was the one making my life hard. Even hard decisions don’t need to be agonized over for months. It’s okay to toss a coin. It’s okay to shrug and pick something without knowing all the answers.I think that anxiety is becoming an accepted part of our world and that is both good and bad.

This is my first non-fiction that I have read. I thought that it was just another self-book book but while reading this I realized that the book was not really giving advice to live a good life but a suggestion on how to really avoid something bad which I loved the most.Some of the learning of life that I took from this book are as follows -  1. Don't base your decisions based on your emotions rather base it on something that is more tangible than emotions. 2. Don't measure yourself by the bad things in life. Look at the bright side of things sometimes. 3. Don't always look at the positive side of the things. Look also at the struggle and the pain that took to attain the positive status. 4. The failure doesn't really make you a loser. It's just another option that you tried and it was not for you. It gives you more experience in a particular task you are implementing. 5. The person should not blame others for the problems they cause. They need to take responsibility for the problem. 6. Nobody is special in this world. Everyone has problem that need solving so you don't have the right to cause a big fuss. Just start working on it. 7. If others are having any issues, you have to support them and not solve the issue for them. That will not bring them happiness. 8. Belief is a very powerful concept that can break trust and emotion within a person. So, think before you talk something that you believe in. 9. Freedom doesn't necessarily bring meaning to life. It makes our life without purpose. 10. Death is inevitable for a person. One has to die anyway, at least do something meaningful. 11. Be truthful to the person you are in relation with. This will bring more trust. Don't create a fallacy impression about the person. 12. The values that a person hold need not be something big. Being big sometimes causes more sadness. And last but not the least 
 Don't give a fuck about nothing/trivial matters
. It's all been leading to this idea really. Place your fucks like a deck of cards in a game of black jack at the right place and right time to earn more trust and respect.

El libro brinda apoyo para alguien que quiere vivir en la realidad, alguien que no quiere comprar nuestra mentalidad capitalista nacional de que la vida se trata de perseguir una altura tras otra. Este libro lo alienta a aceptar el conflicto, a sentirse cómodo sintiéndose incómodo y a tener confianza para descubrir lo que realmente cree y luego defenderlo. Joder, ser simpático. Asume la responsabilidad de tu propia vida, deja de intentar resolver los problemas de los demás (¡uno grande en el que tengo que trabajar!), Haz preguntas y siempre trata de mejorar las cosas.

Minimizando el alcance de sus intereses en realidad, a lo esencial. Poner todos tus huevos en esa canasta. Averiguar qué es esa canasta en primer lugar. ¿Tiene sentido?Disfruté un par de ideas. Uno de ellos es sobre la importancia de cultivar la duda. Manson afirma que la incertidumbre es el camino a seguir y que la clave del crecimiento personal radica en sentirse cómodo con ella. La comodidad genera una apertura que anula el apego a valores rígidos y nos motiva hacia un cambio positivo. La incertidumbre rompe la cadena de los derechos, la creencia de que eres un copo de nieve especial que merece un trato especial del mundo: la ingenuidad de esperar algo por nada, ser amado por no hacer nada, ser apreciado por no hacer nada, etc."

Vielleicht bin ich keine Ratgeber-Leserin oder dies war einfach der Falsche für mich. Die Sprache ist simpel und die Kernaussagen steht im Grunde schon im Titel. Viel Neues war schon auf den ersten Seiten nicht zu erfahren und mir war es zuviel selbstverliebtes BlaBla des Autoren. Ein paar Anekdoten waren nett, ein paar ironische Zeilen zum Schmunzeln, aber viele Aussagen konnte ich einfach nicht teilen und es wirkte stark danach, dass Mark Manson einfach nur seine Meinung niederschreibt. Ich konnte keine Quellenangaben für Studien im Buch finden, was mich schon stört, denn so wirkte alles nach Verallgemeinerung. Hin und wieder war mir die Sprache auch etwas zu derb. Aber ich verstehe, warum er - besonders in den USA - mit so einem Werk Erfolg hat. Mir war es auch zu chaotisch geschrieben und wenn ich schon auf den ersten Seiten keine Struktur erkennen kann und mir seine „Weisheiten“ nicht merke, dann hab ich es lieber abgebrochen und verbringe meine Lesezeit mit anderen Büchern. Getreu seinem Motto „Not giving a f*ck“ ärgert mich das auch nicht.

The author is skillfully shrewd on giving valuable advices to the reader where the life can play havoc on the endeavor. It is the wise who is key to elevate Thyself amidst resistance to development of personality. This autobiographical style self-help adds greater depth to the character in the life environment to reframe the attitude for a renewed comeback for the setbacks.

When I saw it on the shelf at Barnes & Noble, I found myself laughing at it. Then a young woman walked by, saw what I was looking at, and said “That’s a really good book.” With my interest peaked, I bought a copy to read on my latest business trip. I read half of the book on my flight from Seattle to Atlanta and the other half on a returning flight three days later. It turned out to be an interesting read.Don’t let the title be a turn off. Manson writes with what many will refer to as a potty mouth and that’s true. He lets his inside voice out in ways that will both offend and make you chuckle out loud. But the strength in the book is that he has found a way to present good information in a different way, a way that many may respond positively too. By letting his inside voice out, Manson successfully communicates his thoughts in a direct and no-holds barred manner that grabs your attention and makes you think about the knowledge and wisdom he shares. I especially loved his comparison of reality to aging and a certain part of Jennifer Aniston’s physique. You can read that one for yourself.So, the key question is what is the book really about? The reference to not giving a… is really a reference to prioritizing in life. It is about how we make choices on what is important and what is not important. Although the information is not necessarily new, it is presented as lessons, using real life examples to emphasize applicability. Manson shares these lessons in a simple, organized manner that builds on each other. I especially appreciated his honesty, understanding that success requires real and work to achieve, and that failure is an important step in learning. These life lessons are easy to relate to, reflect on. and apply in our own lives. Overall, “The Subtle Art…” was a quick and easy read, but one that was well worth it. Several times I found myself agreeing with Manson’s assessment’s and reflecting on my own situations. Even though he expresses himself in a shock-jock manner, his voice brings a raw honesty that helps strengthen his subject matter. Manson has won me over, and I sincerely believe if you give him a try, he will win you over too. Try him and find out for yourself. Your call. I don’t give a…"

I was experiencing an occupational crisis (OK, this might be an overestimation, but anyhow), which I was upset about, then this book appeared to be the bible for those having a hard time i.e. me, it guided me through my difficult time, taught me how to channel all this anger/bad feelings into something positive=doing something! Interestingly, I also went through a lack of motivation and interest about one particular task I had to complete, yet again, this book, my savior, injected some motivation into me via teaching me ""working"" itself is the key to retain the energy and the motivation to keep going on.I'm a person with a carefree attitude towards matters out of my control, true, but this deeply moving book taught me even more of the hows and whys of not caring AT ALL about unimportant trivial matters/events in my life. Plus, it makes you reconsider your previously built values in the light of learning what really matters in the long run, and the fact that we will eventually die someday!I highly recommend this book to everyone, regardless of how old they are, regardless of their problems, their religions, their occupations, etc."

This book is like reading a rough draft of a high school freshman trying to write a research paper but who is too lazy to cite sources. I cannot believe that this book made it to the general public without so much as a Notes/Source appendix (I'm looking at you, HarperOne). There were so many references that should have been properly cited, that were not. As many other reviewers have stated, much of what the author writes has been said before and in better words. If you want a more concise version of this book minus the sexist remarks, I definitely recommend Sarah Knight's book mentioned above. I would even recommend the readings that Manson alludes to, but doesn't source. It really is appalling to have so many blanket statements without any type of evidence to support your claim, specifically with accusations that he makes against many people and his mentions of neuroscience and psychology. Do not recommend."

Then I thought, wait Ravi! You ought to behave like a gentleman. So I sacrificed my darling desire on the altar of sophistication. Well, you all must be agreed that the irony of the age is that we are taught to be sophisticated but all admired arts are often found beyond sophistication. I guess the writer has found this irony and applied in his book. So far this is the fourth self-help book that I ever read and got this hitting to the core.The word ‘Fu*k’ that has many-many meanings in English is written almost thousands of times in the book. You can guess “this is the importance of giving a F*ck”. The book is divided in nine well-built chapters and in every chapter Mark gives the audience a chance to peep in his own life. So this book is part autobiography, part reading, part travelling, part about the girls he slept with and part his sermons.

The author has values and presents them so that you pick them up and live a life. I would not say to live a *better* life because this would contradict with the book. It says that good is bad and bad is good and you need to adjust your values accordingly.The reason I gave 3 stars is that I found some quite good and useful examples and conclusions. From that point of view, I could've rated it higher. It's otherwise not what I look for. Gurus teaching me how to live need to be backed by science, not by anecdotal evidence.An example for a good find in the book:“When I was in high school, my math teacher Mr. Packwood used to say, “If you’re stuck on a problem, don’t sit there and think about it; just start working on it. Even if you don’t know what you’re doing, the simple act of working on it will eventually cause the right ideas to show up in your head.”"

278,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/117703239-robert--alexandru-nitu,Rating 5 out of 5,"The author's informal approach at the beginning of the book made me skeptical, but then I realized this is just his way of making the book a quick read. The author makes good points, some of which might seem less common. He does seem to be inspired by philosophy in his ideas, especially in the last chapter when he talks about death and how the conscious contemplation of death is a humbling experience for all humans and also a transformative process which can change our values. One could say that the author does adopt a stoic view to life, as well as a nietzchean perspective when he recommends people to embrace pain and the realization that we all die since this is what makes us stronger. I've also found Jordan Peterson in some of his words when he was describing how committing to a single path in life is more rewarding than having a broad range of options. When people commit to something (a relationship, a job, a hobby - say, singing or any other such activity), they are actively excluding all other options. As Peterson also put it, part of becoming an adult consists of choosing a path because if you don't choose one, you'll be only potential, never something specific. This is also tied to Aristotle which makes a distinction between potential and being. When we don't make choices, we're potential. Actually, we as humans are potentially a lot of things: an artist, a leader, a firefighter, a criminal, etc. We all have these options in our life, but of course, we choose which one to manifest and the choice is often difficult since when you're presented with a lot of options, choosing a specific thing can lead to anxiety (for example the doubt if the choice is correct / the best). When we choose something, we're actualizing our potential and it's very important to choose carefully because as the author says, the path you choose means choosing the problems you're willing to deal with. You can't live a life without problems so then it's a matter of what problems are you willing to put up with. Pick your battles, someone could say. Towards the end of the book, the author mentions another book, The Denial of Death by Ernest Becker and summarizes the main points. The most interesting one was definitely that we have a physical and a conceptual self and since humans realize that they're going to die, they attempt to have ther conceptual self live on by putting their mark on the world in one way or another (creative endeavors for example). Often children are also in part this manifestation of the desire of the parents to have their conceptual self live on through someone else after their death (just think of the phrase ""leaving a legacy""). Becker uses this psychological distinction to make an anthropological claim: everything we have built as humans was the result of this wish to ""leave something behind"" after one's death, be it a creation or children and wars are the clash of opposing people's desires to have their conceptual self exist after their death (example: the ambition to win a war in order to remain in history). So, since humans are conscious about their mortality, they are driven to act in all sorts of ways, to achieve something since life is limited. On the other hand, the limit of life makes our actions more meaningful. If no one would ever die, actions wouldn't hold much weight in themselves, but since time is limited we have to choose carefully what we spend our time and energy on (or as the author says, what we give a fuck about). To find out what to care about, we have to do some soul searching, to find our values and what criteria we use to check if we stand up to these values since often the wrong values or metric / criteria makes all the difference. Contemplating death is one such way of humbling oneself since it does away with all the superficial values like chasing material gains only. When one realizes how brief their existence is, they gain freedom to do anything and the courage to act, to do something. This is in part a spiritual search in the sense that we're humbled when we realize we're just a small part of something so much greater (be it the universe, the divine plan or some sort of group). Meaning in our lives is gained by picking our problems / hardships and solving our problems, not by living without any problems or by ignoring them. Going to end with this quote by Najwa Zebian which I've never seen before until now:  “These mountains that you are carrying, you were only supposed to climb.”  We're meant to get over our problems, not endure them as a permanent burden. Our burden is mainly psychological in nature. Making peace with death and consciously reflecting about our own fragility is key to holding our values in line and consequently, making the right choices. Religion, meditation, philosophy or other such endeavors are tools to constantly remind us that death is coming and to make peace with it and thus we should act accordingly.  Memento mori , one would whisper to the emperor."
279,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45214031-shompa,Rating 4 out of 5,"I really liked this book, even more the second time around. It's a pretty straightforward writing that's not filled with a bunch of fancy jargon or complicated ideas. The author talks about facts in a way that's really refreshing, as he doesn't ever sugarcoat things here for a minute. His way of speaking may seem harsh or aggressive to many, but I find it very interesting. The book has some great advice on how to prioritize what really matters in life and stop worrying about the small stuff. It's a down-to-earth guide to living more meaningful life, and I found it to be quite relatable, especially on my second read.The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that some of the concepts can get a bit repetitive at times. But overall, it's a good read."
280,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3547706-sofia-teixeira,Rating 4 out of 5,"Não me lembro bem como é que ""conheci"" o Mark Manson, mas sei que já lá vão uns anos desde que subscrevi o seu blogue. A sua irreverência, o facto de não ter papas na língua, mesmo que muitas vezes franzisse o sobrolho ao que declarava, é uma das inspirações para ser sempre transparente no que escrevo aqui no blogue. Já sabia da existência deste livro, apesar de nunca o ter lido no original. Boa parte do conteúdo já se encontra espalhado pelos seus artigos ao longo dos anos, ou pelo menos algumas partes pareciam-me já bastante familiares, que fui lendo sempre com alguma expectativa. Ainda hoje visito o blogue dele com frequência. Em A Arte Subtil De Saber Dizer Que Se F*da, Mark Manson consegue então reunir uma série de reflexões sobre aquilo a que nós, humanos, tendemos a dar valor e que muitas vezes não tem valor nenhum. Não considero um livro de auto-ajuda, mas antes uma obra de Não-Ficção que nos dá uma perspectiva pessoal, com exemplos reais da sua vida, de como por vezes temos prioridades e valores com ordens trocadas. Acima de tudo, Mark Manson obriga-nos a ""olharmo-nos ao espelho"" e a sermos completamente honestos connosco mesmos. Uma abordagem que é cada vez mais necessária, sem névoas, sem paninhos quentes.O título original da obra (que penso que era parecido com o artigo do blogue dele que li relacionado) é The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck. Apesar da irreverência ter sido mantida no título português, existem subtilezas que a tradução acaba por fazer com que se percam. No livro é utilizada muitas vezes a expressão de ""não nos importarmos"" com as coisas, mas em inglês ""not give a fuck"" tem uma força um pouco diferente. Não é só não nos importarmos, não é só dizer ""que se foda"", é também ser-nos completamente indiferentes. Daí o título original. Mark Manson utiliza várias vezes o ""not give a fuck"" durante o texto e nós nem sempre podemos substituir isso por dizer ""que se foda"". Pormenores picuinhas à parte, há duas formas de encarar este livro: achar que este livro traz consigo soluções e sair desiludido ou encarar esta narrativa como um abre olhos, um confronto com a nossa postura (quer se concorde quer não) e sair com uma maior determinação em relação àquilo que se quer para si mesmo. E esta última hipótese não significa que iremos concordar sempre com o Mark, às vezes até o acho um pouco incoerente, mas ele tem mesmo a capacidade de colocar as coisas em perspectiva. Não sei se alguma vez já fizeram algum tipo de terapia ou foram a algum psicólogo/psiquiatra, mas muitas vezes o que estes fazem (mais do que medicar ou dizer que a vida é linda e que vai tudo ficar bem) é colocar algumas questões (sem conotação de julgamento) que nos colocam em cheque com as nossas crenças. E é isto que A Arte Subtil De Saber Dizer Que Se F*da também consegue. O facto de sentirmos uma profunda franqueza por parte do autor, e é por isso que nos damos ao luxo de dizer facilmente ""este gajo é maluco, que se foda"", faz com que haja uma maior ligação e uma maior abertura para considerarmos o que ele nos tenta transmitir. Resumindo: dizer ""que se foda"" não é não nos importarmos com nada, é antes sabermos escolher bem as nossas lutas e aquilo pelo qual vale empreendermos o nosso tempo e dizer ""que se foda"" a tudo o que contrarie isso e que possa exigir de nós mais o que aquilo que merece. A vida é feita de pequenas lutas, mas umas valem mais o nosso tempo e dedicação do que outras. A motivação, os valores inerentes a cada uma das nossas acções merecem ser pesadas para percebermos até que ponto são benéficas ou nocivas. E é isto que Mark Manson nos tenta incutir, pelo menos na minha interpretação."
281,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"If there is any book That I would most definitely recommend , it is for sure this book .I'VE heard so much about it and at first I really didn't understand what was the hype about , but once I opened the first few pages I found myself drawn so passional to it ,and got so hyped myself. It's one of those books that gives a slap on the face every dew pages . before reading this book I had some beliefs about my self conscious , my relationships , my job that I decided to put under the microscope after reading . I re- evaluted many of my choices , simply because what the book was saying was absolutely real , and made sense . The subtle art of not giving an F, is a book that touches on various parts of life, and in every part you feel that is actually bringing parts of your own lives , This is how genuine and real the book is.The amount of similarities that you find as a reader between you and the writer is almost incredible. and the best part about it all is that we as readers lear directly form the experiences of Mark Manson .while reading the book I found myself writing and taking continuous notes , but probable one of the most things that caught my mind was when Manson switched the whole idea of positivity and negativity acceptance in our lives , he brought up a new definition for it all. “Everything worthwhile in life is won through surmounting the associated negative experience. Any attempt to escape the negative, to avoid it or quash it or silence it, only backfires. The avoidance of suffering is a form of suffering. The avoidance of struggle is a struggle. The denial of failure is a failure. Hiding what is shameful is itself a form of shame.Pain is an inextricable thread in the fabric of life, and to tear it out is not only impossible, but destructive: attempting to tear it out unravels everything else with it. To try to avoid pain is to give too many fucks about pain. In contrast, if you’re able to not give a fuck about the pain, you become unstoppable."" ~~~~ Mark Manson” This piece is incredibly incredible , and for me it made a lot of sense and built a new perspective to try to accept the reality that no one talks about, but instead they try to beauty it , and that is the worst thing to do .ANOTHER IMPORTANT FACTOR THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED ABOUT THE BOOK IS THE FACT : that despite the name of the book might sound like someone telling you "" not to care about anything "" it is absolutely the opposite , MANSON is telling that there is an end to your life and the lives of others , so you better live the life that you want and give a care about few things and leave the rest if you simply don't care about them , as he refers to it in this quote :“You and everyone you know are going to be dead soon. And in the short amount of time between here and there, you have a limited amount of fucks to give. Very few, in fact. And if you go around giving a fuck about everything and everyone without conscious thought or choice—well, then you’re going to get fucked.” and despite that I hate the bad language in any sort of way , wish propabley was the most annoying part in the book for me , But I absolutely love this quote and adore the book .Have a good read Aya"

Even if they are entrenched within your very being. Manson tries to entertain this notion that ""maybe"" you should consider that your values are WRONG!He discusses the concept of happiness, he relentlessly strives to delineate that our values for happiness-what have been imposed by ideologies or society- are, in fact, only a nostrum not the panacea. He writes: ""we are wired to become dissatisfied with whatever we have and satisfied by only what we do not have. This constant dissatisfaction has kept our species fighting and striving, building, and conquering"".In chapter 3 he discusses that none of us are ""special"", I strongly agree with the author about this, the apocryphal story that every day we are bombarded with, engenders a sense of insecurity, due to which we become ""insufficient"" for ourselves, this will result in unhappiness. In this regard, he writes: The problem is that the pervasiveness of technology and mass marketing is crewing up a lot of people's expectations for themselves. The inundation of the exceptional makes people feel worse about themselves, makes them feel that they need to be more extreme, more radical, and more self-assured to get noticed or even matter.If the innate nature of our values is wrong then we could never become truly satisfied. He correctly addresses one of the issues which I think is running amok in our societies and that is materialismin chapter 4 we can read: ""The other issue with over evaluating material success is the danger of prioritizing it over values, such as honesty, nonviolence, and compassion. When people measure themselves not by their behavior, but by the status symbol they're able to collect, then not only are they shallow, but they are probably assholes as well.Chapter 6 discusses the detrimental effects of fallacious preconceptions of ourselves. We define ourselves by these preconceptions and we feel incapacitated and incompetent, we have to consider that maybe we are simply WRONG. It's easier to sit in a painful certainty that nobody would find you attractive, that nobody appreciates your talents than to actually test those beliefs and find out for sureThen he perfectly delineates the situation of the young generation, as they are in a ""phantasmagoria"", they utterly subscribe to the idea that without any effort they are worthy of achieving great things. The pampering of the modern mind has resulted in a population that feels deserving of something without earning that something, a population that feels they have a right to something without sacrificing for it.All in all, this book, tells you that in order to construct yourself first you have to destruct it."

It made me think so much, learn new things and reflect so so much throughout reading. The whole book honestly felt like having a conversation with a real friend who gave you a pat on the back and was not afraid to call you out, but also was there to reassure you and even though the whole conversation could at first seem as fundamentally offensive, it's actually hopeful and strengthening, in a way. The writing was easy, but still it made me connect even more to the whole book and all the ideas. I heard people say they enjoyed the first or second part of the book more, but I actually found both equally enjoyable. Also, this book made me laugh at times and one of my favorite parts was the feedback loop from hell (""There’s an insidious quirk to your brain that, if you let it, can drive you absolutely batty. Tell me if this sounds familiar to you:You get anxious about confronting somebody in your life. That anxiety cripples you and you start wondering why you’re so anxious. Now you’re becoming anxious about being anxious. Oh no! Doubly anxious! Now you’re anxious about your anxiety, which is causing more anxiety. Quick, where’s the whiskey?"")Overall, even though I haven't read many non- fiction books, this was a great read, it resonated with me and even though this book will not be read by everyone nor loved by everyone, I liked it and it felt liberating in a way, because it really tells you what you need to hear and not necessarily what you want."

285,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"Mark Manson touches the chord within so deeply that it feels as if he sees our very private sensitivities, insecurities, false pursuits, selfish egos like no one else. Mark, in fact, exposes the harsh reality of our fake, aimless life for us to .make some sense out of it. Mark raises important questions regarding validity of our entrenched concepts - sense of entitlement, victim-saver enigma, delusional beliefs, self assuring assumptions, fear of failure, success/greatness metrics, and so many others. Do we give everything a f*ck? He is adamant we must learn the subtle art of not giving a f*ck! Rightly so, in so many situations at least. Mark is honest when he dissects boundaries : responsibility and true love/frienship/relationship. Trust is like a China clay plate; once broken is hard to join as it were before breakage; so we need to watch out ! Mark finally leaves us with a big question of life: what is my legacy? Have I ever thought beyond my selfish self! To truly live, one needs to think about others. And that could be done, if we know every moment of our lives that we are here for a day or less. Confronting mortality, frees us from our superficial values and destinations- a slow, sweet poison to us we hardly realise. Mark Manson, I truly loved the dialogue! Thanks."

Kafama taktığım şeylerin artık sağlığımı etkilediği noktada da belki bir faydası olur diye arkadaşımın tavsiyesiyle denedim. Şunu çok ilginç buldum. İlk bölüm haricinde hiçbir yerde ""kafayı takmama"" ile ilgili birşey yazmıyor. Kendi tecrübeleri bolca var, popüler kültürden örnekler bolca var ancak ""kafayı takmama"" ile ilgili pek birşey yok. Şu sözlerse çok doğru:Bir sanatçının, insanın bir sorunu olmadığı zaman, kafasının otomatik olarak sorun yaratacak bir yol bulduğunu söylediğini duymuştum. Çoğu insanın, özellikle de eğitimli, şımartılmış orta-sınıf beyazların ""hayatın tasaları"" olarak gördüklerinin, gerçekten kaygılanacak daha önemli şeylerinin olmayışının yan etkileri olduğunu düşünüyorum. Demek ki yaşamınızda önemli ve anlamlı bir şey bulmak zamanınızı ve enerjinizi kullanmanın en verimli yoludur. Çünkü bu anlamlı şeyi bulamazsanız anlamsız ve önemsiz şeyleri kafaya takacaksınız.Bence en güzel bölüm burasıydı. Çünkü düşünüyorum da benim kafamı taktığım şeyler muhtemelen çok daha önemli ve acil düşünceleri olan insanların aklının kenarından bile geçmiyordur. O yüzden gerçekten hiçbir şeyin üzerine çok fazla düşünmemek, takılmamak lazım. Herkese keyifli okumalar!"

If he wasn't a writer, he would have been that crazy gym instructor who screams his head off, makes you cry, curse and swear not to come back, only until you examine yourself in the mirror, check your ego and decide not only to give it another shot but also accompany that with a steamy recommendation to all your friends. This is my ""steamy recommendation"" lol. (Back to the review); very good self-help book, its frank, honest and a bit vulgar (like the best advice). I recommend it to everyone who hasn't read it.

O ducem atât de bine material, dar psihic suntem tulburați la modul cel mai josnic și superficial. Oamenii refuză responsabilitatea, pretinzând că societatea ar trebui să aibă grijă de sentimentele și de sensibilitatea lor. Oamenii țin cu dinții de certitudinile lor arbitrare, încercând să le impună altora, uneori prin violență, în numele unor cauze nobile inventate. Oamenii, amețiți de senzația unei false superiorități, devin pasivi și letargici, prea speriați că vor da greș ca să mai încerce să facă ceva important.Bukowski scria cândva: 'Toți vom muri, toți până la ultimul.

I was intrigued by the title, but after checking out some reviews, realized that I wasn’t interested. After it continued to pop up as a recommendation, I finally gave in. Pretty quickly, I realized why I hadn’t been interested. This book is the author’s reflection on lessons he’s learned in his journey from an entitled, self-absorbed, and aimless young man to someone with a more secure sense of self. I suspect that it works really well for people who are at the beginning of a similar journey, especially young, class- and race-privileged people who feel spiritually unmoored. The book is sort of a white, middle-class, Western take on Buddhism. So if that’s your thing, this might be a meaningful book for you. If not, I read it so that you don’t have to."

306,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14105531-robin-bridge-four,Rating 4 out of 5,"This review was originally posted on  Books of My Heart4.5 heartsThe Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck was one of those books I read because it was recommended to me by a friend in real life (this usually does not go well) but it seemed like an interesting twist to a self-help book so I gave it a go.  This book is full of irreverent language, which I think the title implies but if you are sensitive to that, buyer beware.The thing I liked about this book is that it doesn't give you the same ole same ole power of positive thinking and you are so awesome.  What it does is really focus in on some truths that most self help books don't touch on.  You are not special, only a select few people are outside the bell curve and fall into ""special"" categories.  By definition if everyone is special, then no one is special.  I can get behind that a lot more than you are so special if you just tap into your blah blah or do blah blah.  I think this book really embraces that everyone in life has challenges and problems.  It isn't a bad thing, Warren Buffet has money problems, they are just different that your money problems.  It is the challenges and problems in life that give us meaning and help us feel worth.  If you had no challenges how happy could you really be.

“Because here’s the thing that’s wrong with all of the “How to Be Happy” shit that’s been shared eight million times on Facebook in the past few years—here’s what nobody realizes about all of this crap: The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience. This is a total mind-fuck. So I’ll give you a minute to unpretzel your brain and maybe read that again: Wanting positive experience is a negative experience; accepting negative experience is a positive experience. It’s what the philosopher Alan Watts used to refer to as “the backwards law”—the idea that the more you pursue feeling better all the time, the less satisfied you become, as pursuing something only reinforces the fact that you lack it in the first place.

In this age of social media, I think the expectations to be happy or share every average moment in your life with people you don't really know has lead to unrealistic expectations.  It sets people up to have this need to have something great or terrible to share with the world.  If you are always looking to feel in one extreme way or another it becomes unusual to just be content in the moment.  We were not meant to live in extremes.  Dating apps let you meet so many more people, but do you really spend any time building connections?  If at the first sign of someone not being perfect you can just swipe right or left to be on to your next potentially perfect person.  Pro Tip: there is not a perfect person, there are just people that you like more things about than others.  Ask yourself, does this make my life better, does this make me happy?One of my favorite parts of this books was disappointment Panda and his nuggets of wisdom.  I think we all need someone to tell us we aren't special and life isn't perfect.  But in a better yoda like way.
“Don’t hope for a life without problems,” the panda said. “There’s no such thing. Instead, hope for a life full of good problems.”
I enjoyed premise of this book and how well the author gets across his point.  It really isn't a book about not caring, but being select about what you care about.  Don't get caught up in the new need to feel outraged about everything.  Not everything carries the same weight in your life nor should it.  We as a society have become a little obsessed and outrage porn is a thing.  Pick the things you care about, give a F*ck about those and don't give a F*ck about the rest.  Pick your battles, pick who and what you really care about and the rest will take care of itself.I loved the concepts in this book and think anyone could use them in their lives.  Don't read another ""this is how you find happiness"" book, until you read this one.
Narration:
I have listened to books by Roger Wayne before, mostly in the Urban Fantasy vein but this was my first self-help book.  He did a great job of getting the authors message across and bringing life to a nonfiction book.  I liked his take on how to narrate the story and embrace the language, because the irreverent language was part of the fun of this audiobook.  I was able to listen at my usual 1.5x speed.Listen to a clip HERE."
307,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15605093-hestia-istiviani,Rating 4 out of 5,"I read in English but this review is written in Bahasa IndonesiaDibilang cukup terlambat memang. Buku ini rilis pada tahun 2016 akhir, sempat menjadi bahan obrolan di beberapa akun media sosial para selebritis internet, namun baru pada kuartal pertama 2018 aku berani mencobanya. Belum ada mood yang tepat jika itu yang menjadi pertanyaan mengapa aku baru memulai. Judul ini nyatanya cukup laku di Indonesia. Bahkan Gramedia mau menerbitkan edisi terjemahan (aku pernah memergoki seseorang membaca judul ini di kereta). Dari adik hingga rekan kerja, sudah ada yang membaca. Rasanya, aku akan semakin tertinggal jika tidak segera memaksakan diri. Murakami pernah bilang, isi kepala kita akan sama dengan orang lain jika kita membaca buku yang sama dengan mereka. Kali ini, aku kurang setuju. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fck (selanjutnya disingkat menjadi TSANGF) menjadi bahan refleksi yang baik bagi pribadi seseorang. Mark Mason, seorang blogger dengan jutaan pembaca (begitu setidaknya ia mengatakan), menulis buku ini dengan caranya yang sangat mudah dipahami. Ia membicarakan permasalahan manusia dengan bahasanya yang gamblang. Terkadang kasar, tapi dengan begitu, pembaca akan sadar dimana letak permasalahan yang sebenarnya. Mason selalu mengawali setiap bab dengan cerita. Entah itu cerita tentang fenomena atau tokoh bahkan pengalaman hidupnya sendiri. Mason menjembatani inti materinya dengan story telling yang membuat pembaca berada dalam konteks. Misalnya saja ada sebuah bab yang dibuka dengan kisah Buddha. Ada pula dengan kisah Romeo dan Juliet. Mason membuat pembaca nyaman terlebih dahulu melalui cerita-cerita yang sudah awam di masyarakat kemudian mulai melakukan pemetaan dan membeberkan apa saja permasalahan yang kerap ditemui manusia.TSANGF bukanlah buku self-help. TSANGF mengatakan sendiri bahwa ia adalah buku self improvement. Buku yang ditujukan kepada orang-orang yang ingin mengimprovisasi bagaimana ia berlaku sehari-hari. Mason pun sudah sangat jujur bahwa tidak mungkin seseorang akan langsung berubah setelah membaca bukunya. Semua orang punya keputusan untuk sekedar menjadikan TSANGF sebagai bahan bacaan, atau akan mulai melakukan sesuatu yang sudah ia pancing terlebih dahulu. Beberapa bagian membukakan mata pembaca bahwa kita seringkali mengejar sesuatu yang berjangka pendek. Salah satunya adalah dengan mendefinisikan apa itu ""bahagia."" Memamg, memiliki sebuah mobil mewah akan membuat seseorang bahagia, tetapi bukan itu yang sebenarnya dicari manusia. Mason juga terus mengingatkan, definisi ""sukses"", ""bahagia"" dan ""berhasil"" setiap manusia bisa berbeda-beda. Tapi tetap saja manusia menggunakan standar yang sama. Alias dipukul rata.Dalam bukunya, Mason ""menampar"" dengan caranya. Ia terang-terangan menjelaskan bagaimana seseorang dalam hubungan (entah itu asmara atau kerja atau keluarga) selalu merasa bahwa ia yang harus diberikan pelayanan. Padahal, pikiran-pikiran itulah yang mengacu pada hubungan tidak sehat -- ketika seseorang merasa ia berhak mendapatkan hal tersebut (entitled). TSANGF sangat menyenangkan untuk dibaca. Ia tidak membuat pembaca bosan. Terutama dengan kehadiran tokoh ""Disappointment Panda"", yang tugasnya adalah memberi tahu manusia akan kebenaran (meski itu pahit) daripada memanjakan dengan bualan-bualan manis nan superficial.Selepas membaca TSANGF, aku malah membayangkan bahwa buku ini akan berkesinambungan jika dibaca dengan The Art of Thinking Clearly oleh Rolf Dobelli."

309,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28266634-liza-fireman,Rating 2 out of 5,"The description says ""a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today"". Here is a short summary by the author: You and everyone you know are going to be dead soon. And in the short amount of time between here and there, you have a limited amount of fucks to give. Very few, in fact. And if you go around giving a fuck about everything and everyone without conscious thought or choice—well, then you’re going to get fucked. Is this healthy approach of a balanced be yourself and choose what and who you care about? Well, I would claim that not really. Actually, I have seen people in the past that after going to mindfulness workshops figured that the beach and concentrating on themselves is more important than anything, and became selfish people, and some that became amazing and open. So it depends what is your starting point, and it depends how far you go with this.I didn't like the language, I didn't like the sense of humor. I really think that it is not funny. Maybe a 4 year old ""I am a sweet potato funny"". Is this language makes people get so excited? Is this the candid, honest, refreshing that we are looking for? I would hope not, I would claim that not. And if yes, than our situation is not awesome.There are so many great books that are giving better messages, including  embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek. I actually didn't see much of this in this book, but I did find it in many others. One of the latest examples is Girl, Wash Your Face: Stop Believing the Lies about Who You Are So You Can Become Who You Were Meant to Be by Rachel Hollis. I would continue to disagree with not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault. It is true that not everybody can be extraordinary, but it is not true that there are winners and losers by design. Life is not sum zero game, and there is no referee out there. Not funny, not adding anything new that you didn't hear at least a thousand times, and with a language that should be skipped, the author should have learned a few more words and phrases instead of being so repetitive and childish. Not giving a **star**. 2 minus."
310,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66292681-sarah-lumos,Rating 3 out of 5,"I read this book because of its attention-grabbing title. I expected  The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life  to be a straight forward, no-nonsense self-help book. A bit like getting blunt advice from a logical friend, and it was. After reading it, I can understand why it is so popular. I think a lot of people like hearing advice in this manner. However, I am not one of those people, but that is not the main reason why I disliked this book.I tend to stray away from self-help books in general. For me, memoirs are my therapeutic niche. I love immersing myself in an author's journey and seeing how they overcome their challenges. Memoirs have taught me some of my most valuable life lessons. Other than memoirs, I also find non-fiction books about mental health that are based more in science and less in advice-giving to be helpful. A good example of this is  The Brain's Way of Healing: Remarkable Discoveries and Recoveries from the Frontiers of Neuroplasticity.  Still, I wanted to give this book a try because everybody was raving about it. I liked a lot of the advice Manson provided in this book. My favorite passage was when Manson talks about the fleeting pleasure of pleasure. When we look back on our lives, we never think fondly about binge-watching Netflix or playing video games, but rather the times where we were challenged, remained strong, and overcame difficulties. It might be counterintuitive, but in the long run, an excessive amount of pleasure does not equate to pleasure. However, other than that, most of the other advice given in this book felt intuitive. Maybe this has to do with my upbringing? My parents wanted us to understand that life is short. We cannot waste time because it is a finite resource. Maybe this book would be eyeopening for someone who grew up in an environment where death was taboo? I guess given the popularity of this book, I expected it to be more? More depth, more nuanced, more peculiarity. Sure, parts of this book were interesting, but the rest of it was too shallow for me to appreciate them. A lot of this book read like a casual self-improvement podcast, which made it a less gratifying reading experience for me. The main reason why I read this book is that I have been going through a rough patch and I thought it might help me be more introspective about my situation, but it did not necessarily give me what I was looking for. But I would still recommend giving this book a try. It is a short (the audiobook was only 5 or so hours) and leisure read. And who knows? Maybe you will benefit more from it then I did. "

And they shouldn’t try, because that won’t make you happy. You can’t solve other people’s problems for them either, because that likewise won’t make them happy. The mark of an unhealthy relationship is two people who try to solve each other’s problems in order to feel good about themselves. Rather, a healthy relationship is when two people solve their own problems in order to feel good about each other.📍Now here’s the problem: Our society today, through the wonders of consumer culture and hey-look-my-life-is-cooler-than-yours social media, has bred a whole generation of people who believe that having these negative experiences is totally not okay.📍Many of the relationships in your life were built around the values you’ve been keeping, so the moment you change those values—the moment you decide that studying is more important than partying, that getting married and having a family is more important than rampant sex, that working a job you believe in is more important than money—your turnaround will reverberate out through your relationships, and many of them will blow up in your face. This too is normal and this too will be uncomfortable.📍By “boundaries” I mean the delineation between two people’s responsibilities for their own problems. People in a healthy relationship with strong boundaries will take responsibility for their own values and problems and not take responsibility for their partner’s values and problems. People in a toxic relationship with poor or no boundaries will regularly avoid responsibility for their own problems and/or take responsibility for their partner’s problems."

He uses a lot of ""facts"" and ""stories"" that he doesn't link to sources, for example the false memory story about false memories and how a massive amount of people have falsely been accused of sexual crimes they didn't commit, a big statement requires a source. This is also a pretty big, rather complex topic to bring up, not to elaborate on. Yes there are people falsely accused of sexual crimes. There is, however, an even greater number of people who do not report sexual crimes that have actually happened, partially due to the stigma these statements cause. I felt Marks throwaway statement was very damaging to women and society. The previous point and the fact that Mark constantly brings up his fkboi days, leads me to the belief that he does 'not give a fk about women,' yet his fragile ego still hasn't gotten over the rejection from ex girlfriends and feels the need to bring them up. This was a completely self indulgent book written to stroke his ego. He simply is not qualified to help others and to write a book it seems. This book is terribly written and seems to be the scratchings of someone getting down their thoughts before going to bed. This book, after the first page, made me realise that I don't need this brand of crappy self help book. I am completely happy giving a fk, about myself, my loved ones and my future. If something or someone doesn't serve a purpose then I will let it/them go, though for now I am happy continually improving my life without this pessimistic, negative BS. I feel this book does society a disservice. We should all continue caring about each other. "

In its essence, the book talks about how to stop focusing on being ""positive"" all the time and learn to accept the negative experiences also.🌺The book proposes a way of life where instead of focusing on creating a ""perfect"" environment, take life for what it is. To understand that life is difficult, shit happens all the time, and there are going to be complications and complexities.That it is okay to feel bad every once in a while, we are all humans with our own limitations. Aiming for a feel-good experience all the time is only going to mess up with our expectations of ideal living.🌺In very easy to read language, crude logics, funny anecdotes, witty remarks and examples from real life, Mark Manson advises to understand what things in life are worth stressing over.And once we embrace our fears and faults, maybe we can begin to inculcate qualities that really matter, courage, perseverance, honesty and mostly to figure out what f*cks to give!If one is looking to start something in nonfiction, I would highly recommend this one.🌺Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐/5"

319,no user info,Rating 1 out of 5,"A huge disappointment. When you have read Manson's blog, it is basically selected articles from there edited into slightly looking like fitting together. I could not find anything new. In addition, when reading these things for the second time, now in a book format, I noticed something disturbing. All the good examples he gives, of becoming a better person, are about himself, and all the ""do not do this"" examples are given about people he doesn't know but observed - with these examples he tries to explain about entitled people, leaving an impression about being a narcissist himself. The book quits giving advice on ""not giving a f***"" just after the first few chapters, and tries to solve everything that's wrong with you without knowing you, eventually contradicting itself (first telling you to change your values, and in the final chapter telling you you are great already). The most annoying part for me was though Manson being certain that fear of death is everyone's main problem. I had that problem when I was a child but I grew up and seriously, don't give a f*** about it any more. It was a complete waste of time and I'm sorry I read it to the end with a stubborn hope of finding something great. "
320,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24154009-jason,Rating 2 out of 5,"I almost never pick up ""self-help"" books. But I was curious about this one, if only for the fact that the title had a swear in it. It wasn't anything grandiose, though. I found it to be more a memoir than anything. Manson did speak a lot about his own personal journey, which can be an effective tool for some because it gives them real life examples to draw from. So, although it didn't work so much for me in that respect, I can see it being useful for others. There were a few insights here and there that I found fresh, and they did cause me to stop and consider a different approach in my own daily life. The best insights were the ones for which Manson provided actual statistical or factual information. When someone is telling me a technique about how I should live my life, I like to see that there have been actual studies done (and repeated, with same or similar results) which show real psychological or physiological results from said technique. In the end, nothing life changing, and I'll probably forget I ever read it because there was no super-fantastical take away from it (for me). I pretty well already live my life not giving very many fucks. But if you don't, then perhaps this is for you. "

Nesu skaitęs daug savigalbos knygų, bet nepaisant to - nesunku suvokti, jog nuolatinis pozityvus mąstymas jokių problemų nesprendžia. Suvokimas, kad kartais viskas yra šūdas ir kažkaip reikia su tuo dealinti - sprendžia.Žavi autoriaus gebėjimas būti atviram, nevynioti į vatą ir nekeliant atmetimo reakcijos leisti suprasti, kad nesi tu jau toks ypatingas snowflake'as, verčiau - toks pat eilinis ir neypatingas žmogus kaip ir visi kiti. Taip pat paprasta kalba, glaustumas, spalvingi pavyzdžiai ir lengvas vulgarumas priverčia kūrinį suskaityt per vieną du prisėdimus.Asmeniškai, dalis autoriaus iškeltų įžvalgų privertė pasijusti gerai, nes ""oo, aš pats tai esu pastebėjęs ir man pavyksta su tuo tvarkytis"", bet dalis atkreipė dėmesį į tendencijas, kurias vis dar esu linkęs palaikyti, nors jos ir yra vienareikšmiškai toksiškos. Nu bet šitas subjektyvumas turbūt kyla iš tiesiog menko kiekio panašios literatūros skaitymo.Trumpai tariant - rekomenduoju visiems, kurie dažnai pagalvoja ""kodėl gyvenimas man yra toks neteisingas"" bei bičiuliams, kurie irgi nežino ką čia tiksliai ir kaip dabar su savo gyvenimais veikti."

Mark Manson has no problems peppering that word into as many sentences as possible and while it didn’t bother me, if it bothers you, this isn’t the book for you. Seriously. Don't pick up this book and then act shocked about the word fuck littering every single page.I listened to the audio over the course of a few days in the car in between work and errands and I really enjoyed it. This is a book full of hard tough to swallow truths that are almost all common sense. Why do we care so much? What do we put energy into caring about? Why do we allow negative emotions like rage to fuel what we care about? Why do we avoid certain events/emotions? Sometimes life sucks and we just have to learn how to deal.I agreed with much of what he has to say and found this book to have enough interesting thoughts to consider with a healthy dose of humor that I recommend it to readers who, like me, aren’t big into self-help books.For more reviews, visit www.rootsandreads.wordpress.com"

Sometimes you just need to hear or hear someone else swear 5,000 times. Yup, I'm a big child. Was this an entertaining book? Yes, for the most part. Did this book change my life? No, not really. What I will say about this book, though, is that it did make me laugh and it did have some points that I agreed with and felt strongly about. There were also a few places where I would have wanted different word choices. Of course, I am meant to ""not give a f*ck"" about it, but I do. Just a little.Moving on. The book isn't all light hearted. As we delve deeper in, the swearing is less and the philosophy/psychology is more. (The sense of humor remains, though) Manson quotes the Buddha and Homer Simpson and few others. He also has some interesting life experiences to share.So here's the rub: You live until you die.

I even thought of marking this as a DNF. But no i kept going with the thought that it might turn the tables at the end and give something that it’s actually worth it and insightful. But the author turned out to be an arrogant shithead that not everything he says stands right by me. Also there isn’t anything particularly new here, just repeating the same old stuff we’ve heard from other people and in more interesting ways.So yeah even though I enjoyed the first few pages (even highlighted some parts on my iPad) the rest was just a mess.

Yet, I'm going to tell you how to practice this not BS thing.Every self help books is BS. Yet, let me tell you what they have been telling you to do in a new way. I wouldn't say it doesn't have one or two concepts... it does but so does many more self help books.
