But please go and order an audiobook because TOM HANKS is fantastic, impeccable, meticulous narrator. (Yes, he is our Danny boy). So as a result paperback version: 4 stars Audiobook: 5 stars Let’s rounded 4.5 up to 5 celebration of master story telling stars!I started to read the book and I was about to give four stars ! Please, don’t get me wrong, I love the writing and those vivid characters, I was about to give million slaps to one of them: Yes, EVIL STEPMOM ANDREA, I’m talking about you! But slow pace and too many jumping between time lines a little exhausted me. But as soon as I learned Tom Hanks is on the board, I stopped reading and I started listening to the book with a huge smile on my face. Danny and Maeve will always stay on my mind and heart as amazing siblings. Their mother abandoned them. (Actually she was another version of Mother Theresa and she rejected to live in a mansion when too many poor people suffer out there so she left the place. She still loved her husband and she didn’t intend to leave her children. Her belief as social responsibilities always come first even it means to neglect her own family is irritated me so much! I’m not quite fan of this character. But thanks God, we have evil stepmother to hate more!) And their father passed away when he was only 53. They both lost their parents at young age but what they didn’t know they would be also homeless with great scheme her stepmother dearest had planned details with her lawyer. She got the control of the business of their father and she got the Dutch House to live with her two daughters. So she kicked her step kids out. She even tried to prevent Danny take money from trust fund for his education because Danny chose an expensive school and her own daughters couldn’t get the highest education they need, if all the money would spend for Danny’s needs. (At least her attempts were stopped by their father’s lawyer this time. I think Andrea deserved a special place in hell but in my opinion, hell would be like a spa treatment for her!) So all the losses they suffered, keep united this brother and sister against the entire world. They became each other’s priorities and supported each other for every big life decisions. (Maeve helped him to connect with his future wife even they didn’t get along for a long time and resented each other!) They grew up, but they resumed going to the Dutch House and stopped their cars in front of the place, waited to see any activity around or inside and they left. THAT BECAME THEIR ROUTINE FOR YEARS like visiting an old relative they check randomly to make sure she’ still alive!Years passed, they got old. They resumed going back there…Till one day their mother returned back and requested them to drive her to the house and finally she bangs on the door to meet with Andrea. That is the beginning of some endings! The house was like a living and functioning organism marked the milestones of the sibling’s lives and changed them forever. Past and future combined with sadness, regrets, resentments, sister and brother’s devotion, marriage, nostalgia, childhood memories, unfinished businesses, yearning for real and functional family, life decisions.  As the life moved on , two siblings’ a special piece of their hearts always stayed with that house, buried there, even they thought they moved on but they couldn’t. Because house gave them hope that one day their mother could return. House made them grow up earlier. House made them connect with their maids, nanny ( also mistress of their father) and many childhood happy memories. Even they’ve kicked out, they have never left the place and the house never left them, too. It left a vulnerable scar on their mind and soul. It always stayed with them till the end of their lives.Amazing story-telling, remarkable characterization and best narration!bloginstagramfacebooktwitter"
1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30181442-yun,Rating 3 out of 5," The Dutch House starts out strong, but then ultimately doesn't go anywhere.We are introduced to siblings Danny and Maeve, the center of this family saga. Their father strikes it rich and buys a lavish mansion known as The Dutch House as a surprise for their mother. That event reverberates with repercussions for everyone in the family and kicks off a five decade long story.This is my first Ann Patchett, and I've heard amazing things about her, so I tore into this book with gusto. And I was hooked from the first page. I found the characters and the writing to be riveting and was thoroughly enthralled with where this story was going. But then about a third of the way into it, a big turning point happened. And after that, well, I didn't really see the point of the story anymore. The writing remained interesting, but the characters and their actions stopped making sense to me. The story kind of fizzled out and then limped along without a clear narrative for the rest of the book.Usually, even if I don't connect with a story, I can still guess what the author is trying to say. But in this case, I'm stumped. Perhaps it's the message that forgiveness is key no matter how egregious the wrong? But that doesn't make sense to me, so I honestly don't know.The writing is still compelling enough that it helped carry the story through to the end, so I was never bored. But the last two thirds shambled along without momentum or purpose, and was utterly forgettable. It feels like I read a short story that reached its conclusion and then continued on for 200 more meandering pages.~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧"
2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1151637-roxane,Rating 4 out of 5,"This was an absorbing read even though the narrator was infuriating, self-absorbed, oblivious, selfish, and annoying. It follows two siblings, Danny and Maeve, and their childhood home, The Dutch House, across decades with a mother who disappeared, an emotionally distant father, his new wife and her daughters and, eventually, Danny’s wife and children. There is an epic feel to this novel but it is also an intimate portrait of siblings who have found home in each other when they are failed by the adults who were supposed to nurture them. Patchett is a formidable novelist. She takes such care with her storytelling. She creates an indelible sense of place and the narrative does some interesting things with chronology. "
3,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4685500-angela-m,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5 starsSometimes in a novel, a place is such a strong and integral part of the story that it deserves as much attention as if it were a character. The house in this novel exerts so much influence over the lives of the characters, sometimes more so than the other people in their lives. The house, with its big windows and ornate design is a symbol of success for Cyril Conroy, the self made real estate developer. To his wife Elna, it is everything that is wrong with the world, when so many others have nothing. To their children, Maeve and Danny, it is where they live. As adults, it’s much more complex; it represents everything they lost. To Conroy’s second wife Andrea, it’s a possession she has to have. Narrated by Danny, the story moves back and forth from their childhood over decades, a family saga of sorts, but the Conroy family for most of the novel is just the two of them, Danny and Maeve. This is in so many ways about the past, the past they can’t let go of, the past that shapes who they become as adults. “Do you think it’s possible to ever see the past as it actually was?” Danny asks his sister Maeve. “ I see the past as it actually was,” Maeve said. Danny responds “ But we overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know, so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.” ** It’s also about sibling love and sacrifice as the brilliant Maeve gives up so much of her life to care for Danny, to make sure he is okay. I was so emotionally connected to them and I loved their relationship. It was at times heartbreaking to see how deep seated these wounds of the past are for both of them .The plot, which captured me from the beginning is one the reader should discover for themselves, so no spoilers here. The bottom line is that I loved pretty much everything about the book - the writing, the characters, the story. I found it nearly perfect and it is 4.5 stars because of something in the end that I found hard to reconcile. I keep a list of favorite writers and Ann Patchett has been on that list for quite a while now. I’ve read every novel she’s published. Her characters always feel fully developed and making an emotional connection is easy because she allows us to know them. Definitely recommended! I read this with Diane and Esil as one of our ongoing buddy reads and as always appreciate their thoughts.**Quotes are from the advanced copy.I received an advanced copy of this book from HarperCollins through Edelweiss."
4,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5211606-julie-g,Rating 3 out of 5,"Reading Road Trip 2020Current location: Pennsylvania“Swear to God, you really were that boring.”The night my book club discussed Ann Patchett's Bel Canto some ten years ago, I clutched my copy of that novel to my chest like a companion animal and huffed and puffed away, defensively, every time a woman in the group grumbled “so unbelievable” and “that ending!” Who were they, those wenches, to speak ill of a book I adored about love and opera? Later, on various telephone calls, my sister (another devoted reader and reviewer) frequently gave the beast a poke, belaboring, yet again, my recommendation of Bel Canto to her. Why had I recommended this far flung tale of messy plot points and undeveloped characters to her?Harrumph.Then came the night at book club when we discussed Patchett's State of Wonder. I was so stricken with jungle love, I was practically sitting there with my Pinot Noir, burning up with malaria. When one of the ladies mentioned the COMPLETELY IMPLAUSIBLE ending, I felt a small flutter of doubt in my heart. . . yes, it's true, the ending was bad, but, but, but. . . The jungle! Okay, there was the scene with that kid and that scene on the dock that made absolutely no sense, but, but. . . The jungle!So, I started The Dutch House with a big smile on my face. I even purchased a new hardcover copy (almost unheard of for me), and jumped right in to Patchett's characteristically readable prose and her memorable one-liners.Oooooh, a mansion! Well, that's as appealing as an opera house or a jungle that holds the promise of sex!But the doubts came quickly with this one. Why were the two protagonists, siblings Maeve and Danny, just sitting outside the house like two cardboard cutouts? Why weren't we ever getting inside their heads, instead of having the story narrated TO US? Was I ever going to know these two people? Was this, like, a play?Wait, wait. . . why were they still sitting there, but two pages ago they were teens and now one is married and the other is graduated and working now. Wait, wait. . . he has kids? But I never even knew him to kiss a girl! Was this, like, a play about time travel?And then. . . when the 53-year-old father, Cyril Conroy, dies and leaves his two motherless children without a will. . . well, folks, I CRIED FOUL. I looked right at my book and declared NO.Not only was Cyril Conroy a REAL ESTATE MOGUL worth God knows how much money, one of his best friends was a LAWYER who not only had drawn up a very detailed educational trust for his kids. . . but Mr. Conroy, being the owner of so many buildings in Pennsylvania and New York, was, in fact, so legally minded, that he once “paid a man from the American consulate to meet [their mother's] ship in Bombay. He'd mailed the divorce papers and the man took my mother straight to the consulate and had her sign them in front of a notary.” And, get this, the next line is: “ALL VERY LEGAL.” (page 288, in case you're interested in details)Cyril Conroy was known for being a stickler, the type of man who crossed his “i's” and dotted his “t's.” This was not a man who would be remiss in having his lawyer draw up a very thorough will for his motherless children.To quote Maeve from the book: “Did that really happen?”To quote Danny from the book: “Are you making this up?”As far as I am concerned, the entire premise of this story is tragically flawed, right from the start. The novel, in my opinion, also makes the mistake of being approximately 100 pages too long, and suffers from almost no real character development. As readers, we are TOLD everything, like a Greek tragedy, narrated aloud. We SEE almost nothing here, but two mannequins sitting in a car, exchanging some clever dialogue.I will tell you this: I will not be the reader with stars in her eyes, when my book club discusses this one."

I’m an English major, so according to my calculations, making millions of dollars will take me...476 years.We’ve got time.Until then, I will think about this book. To keep me motivated and inspired.I will think about how it is beautifully written, and so real and emotive and human, and how I FELT everything that happened in this book. How it all felt real and painful and true.I will think about how I love Maeve, and I love Danny, and I love May and Kevin and Celeste, and I love Sandy and Jocelyn, and how I even love Norma and Bright.Mostly, I will think about the Dutch House, and the borderline grotesque beauty of the dining room, and the big portraits in the living room, and the windowseat in the best bedroom, and the seating area at the top of the stairs, and the warm kitchen, and the cold high-up beds.And those 476 years will just fly by.Bottom line: Immediately after finishing this book, I resolved to read everything by Ann Patchett.----------------pre-reviewactually i grew up in the Dutch House and the characters from this book are my family and this is the story of my life.review to come / 4.5 stars----------------tbr reviewi promise eventually i'll move on from gazing lovingly at this cover and actually open this book"
6,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38610813-paromjit,Rating 4 out of 5,"Ann Patchett's latest novel proves to be a absolute delight to read with its echoes of the darkest of fairytales with the requisite wicked stepmother in the form of Andrea. We are provided with Patchett's acute understanding and keen observational insights of what it is to be human, the complex nature of family and the dysfunctional dynamics that proliferate. Shortly after WW2, Cyril Conroy's life catapults from poverty into wealth which propels him to buy the architectural jewel that is the Dutch House with its many windows in the Pennsylvania suburbs for his wife, Elna, a house that is to splinter his family apart. As the narrative moves back and forth in time through five decades, the house turns out to be an integral part and trigger for the dramas that ensue, the highs and the lows. Danny grew up with little memory of his mother who left so early in his life, and his father is a distant figure, contributing to the strong bond with his older sister, the bright and determined Maeve, a woman of substance who takes on the mantle of caring and protecting him. Cyril brings Andrea into the lives of Maeve and Danny, and goes on to marry her. Andrea, with her children, is driven by ambition that inform her behaviour and decisions, catalysts for how events pan out in the house and family interactions until Cyril's dies, leaving Andrea with everything. Andrea reacts by throwing Maeve and Danny out. The siblings are pushed out of their privileged and comfortable lives, finding themselves facing a life of poverty and challenges with only each other to rely on. Maeve dedicates her life to Danny at the expense of her own life and ambitions, with both positive and negative outcomes, although their future lives are to be shaped by their constant obsession with the house and their inability to let go of the past.Patchett writes a compulsive novel of family, sibling relationships, secrets, memories that can so often turn out to be unreliable, coming to terms with what life can throw at you, grief, loss, love and forgiveness. It is beautifully written, with rich, atmospheric vibrant descriptions and with Patchett's stellar and skilful characterisation and development, she has an uncanny capacity to give us pictures of emotional and meaningful depth of her characters interior lives. This is a brilliant, thought provoking, multilayered, complicated and well crafted book infused with a wryness and humour that made it such a memorable read. Many thanks to Bloomsbury for an ARC."

WRITERS, PLEASE, TRY HARDERit goes without saying that where the first quarter of this book was compelling for me, the other two-thirds completely lost me. what i was invested in were the family dynamics, the brother-sister relationship. what i was not invested in was seeing danny take college courses and hang out with his (painfully boring) girlfriend and do random real-estate things that i could not care less about. (and by the way, celeste's whole character just reeked of the ""im not like other girls"" trope. i know she's peripheral to the story, but she's never her own character, not even a little bit. she exists exclusively in relation to and for danny.) i also didnt really think that the characters' motivations made all that much sense. andrea was barely anything much more than an Evil, Gold Digging Step Mom. and all the animosity between celeste and maeve felt extremely unfounded, not to mention very annoying.reading this book was just one long downward trajectory. the more i read it the more it irritated me till finally at the end i was like okay i definitely dont like this book."
8,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse-walters,Rating 5 out of 5,"E-book - ( own)... and Audiobook.... ( own), narrated by Tom Hanks. Having read and loved other books by Patchett, [“Commwealth”, “Bel Canto”, “State of Wonder”, “This Is The Story of A Happy Marriage”, and “Run”], plus all the raving early reviews - I was looking forward to reading this. And now I’ve joined the choir with other readers and friends singing....“This is a wonderful novel”. I pre-ordered the ebook months ago - soon to learn that my High School boyfriend- [haha]- Tommy Hanks - was reading the Audiobook....so I purchased the Audiobook as well. TOM HANKS was FLAWLESS in reading this novel. Man, he made this book come alive!!! Tom was so darn good - it was easy to be fooled that he was reading his own memoir. Mixing a gifted author with the enormously talented actor, is like finding a FRUIT LOOP in a bowl of CHEERIOS.....( Danny did eat Cheerios for breakfast in this story).Tom Hanks, as narrator, ( cast as Danny Conroy ), delivers Ann Patchett’s novel’s as if he ‘is’ Danny. Hank disappears - and what we are left with is this bright, funny, kid/guy: Danny!!Danny’s devotion to his sister, Maeve, (7 years older than him), is deeply moving. Their relationship is major and memorable. Danny was innocent - uniformed - unenlightened - incognizant in ways - yet when it came to his sister, Maeve, he knew more about her than anyone. He was always looking at her - observing her - loving her - immensely loyal to her. “The story of my sister, was the only story I was meant to tell”....says Danny. “The Dutch House” is a brother-sister psychodrama about wealth, loss of family, sibling loyalty, anger, desire, resentment, love, forgiveness, etc. Danny and Maeve grew up in a luxurious mansion outside of Philadelphia, known as the Dutch House.....(named for previous owners cigarette moguls of Dutch heritage). The details of the house - the descriptions of the rooms - the cook & housekeeper - the family complexities- of mother - father - stepmother - siblings - wives - sickness - college - marriage - divorce - emotional attachments - abandonment - sadness - hope -past & future - is exquisitely impactful. As the story moves along, the house feels like another character. I came to see ‘the house’ as synonymous with family - heartbreaks-and heartwarming. Patchett’s storytelling is bighearted and smart. It’s one of those books that seems to be alive.... with a beating heartbeat. Ann Patchett is an expert at exploring psychological depths beneath the surface of her characters. Every character was easy to imagine. Ann Patchett shared what sparked her narrative for ‘The Dutch House’. She said.... “The Book really started with me thinking about a person who didn’t want to be rich. There’s so much celebration around money, and I thought, ‘what if somebody just wanted to walk away from it all?’ I began thinking about the repercussions of one person‘s decision — how one person‘s decision really changes the path of so many lives. When Danny and Maeve lost the house, she couldn’t get over it. And I think that’s true for a lot of us. Something has happened in our lives, and even if our lives go on to be quite wonderful, we hang on to the hurt.”5 fabulous stars! "
9,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63168028-peter,Rating 4 out of 5,"AttachedThe Dutch House is a story of siblings, Danny and Maeve Conroy, their obsessive connection with the iconic family house they lived in as young children and how their lives unfolded over the years. The story is narrated by Danny over multiple non-linear time periods. The various time jumps and reflections back to important events felt like a jigsaw puzzle being built, where there is the uncertainty of the next piece but once it is placed, the complete picture becomes clearer and clearer. This is a wonderful skill Ann Patchett possesses as I never feel lost or confused as she managed the time transitions so deftly. The other major hallmark of Ann Patchett is her development of amazing characters and relationships. Maeve is Danny’s older sister of 7 years, she is very intelligent, a diabetic, caring to the extreme for her brother, and a character that fascinates and frustrates at times. Danny is much more emotionally reserved and his development into adulthood is interesting to watch. While he takes advantage of top-class education in medicine he can’t shake his love for his father’s business in real estate. Their mother is a memory, having left them when they were young and the story starts with their father bringing Andrea home to visit. Andrea eventually becomes his wife, their new mother and the force that shapes the future relationships within the family.
 “Mothers were the measure of safety, which meant that I was safer than Maeve. After our mother left, Maeve took up the job on my behalf but no one did the same for her.” 
 It’s not too long before Andrea's own two daughters become her sole focus and ambition, and the existing family and staff are unwelcome reminders of a past she wasn’t part of. Andrea is dispassionate, harsh, and greedy, and heir to the Dutch House mansion. Early in the marriage “It also seemed pretty clear he had married the wrong woman. If we all kept to our own corners it was easier for everyone.”After only a few years of marriage, their father dies and leaves the house and business to Andrea who repays his memory by putting both Maeve and Danny out, to never set foot in their home again. This starts an obsessive periodic pilgrimage for Danny and Maeve where they return to the street to sit in a car parked across from the Dutch House and gaze at it recalling memories and wondering how life would have panned out – if only. The emotional baggage they carry together drives them forward but also restricts their successes and paths taken. The psychological burden of seeking happiness and fulfilment, while tied to past commitments and motivations is cleverly layered throughout the story.What I had difficultly with was that I didn’t feel any great pace in the novel and at times wished it would move along in a more compelling rate. The house, while a connecting point, didn’t really have any character and increasingly the story is told away from it. It may be suggested that the house is the central aspect of the story but I would disagree feeling it more appropriate to consider the deep, caring, loving and supportive relationship between a brother and sister growing up with only each other to depend on and if that connection in itself had a restricting effect on how their lives developed. Their real mother returns to the story very late in the book and I just found her motivations, and supposed wisdom, very difficult to accept and jarred so much that it left a frustration with the novel.I would recommend this book and I’d like to thank Bloomsbury Publishing and NetGalley for providing me with an early ARC copy in return for an honest review."
10,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/278339-rincey,Rating 5 out of 5,"Just punch me right in the heart next time, Patchett. It'd be faster.See my full review here: https://youtu.be/xjW9XCANxPU"
11,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/260116-janb,Rating 3 out of 5,"2.5 stars:Danny and Maeve are siblings who can’t overcome their past. Abandoned by their mother at an early age, Maeve, the oldest, assumes the mother role. Everything changes further when their emotionally distant father marries the evil stepmother and the children are cut out of their inheritance. The pain, bitterness, and anger shapes their personalities and their future. How do they move past such a childhood? My questions: What does forgiveness look like? Does forgiveness mean you allow toxic people back into your life? Is that healthy? What is required of the person(s) who did you wrong? I have my own thoughts about these issues but you’ll have to read the book and decide for yourself. Commonwealth is one of my favorite books and this was one of my most anticipated books of the year. The first 75% was riveting reading. But the story took a turn that I found unrealistic and ridiculous. I can’t say more without spoilers but I’m glad I could vent to my reading buddy Marialyce. I’ve tried to discern the author’s purpose in writing this book and it either escapes me or it’s one I can’t buy into. * I received a copy of the book via Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review* for our duo review of this and other books please visit https://yayareadslotsofbooks.wordpres..."
12,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1277371-marialyce-back-in-the-usa,Rating 2 out of 5,"This was a book I had to think about after finishing. I truly wanted to fall into a deep and abiding love for the story and yet I found it so unrealistic that I had to question what if any was the motive behind the story. There seemed to be no overwhelming meaning to the characters. Everyone and everything seemed disjointed and to me a wash of grey characters, not believable and certainly not ones to be emulated. From the dereliction of being a mother, a father who is in all intents absentee, to the relationship of brother and sister and a step family, I could not get a firm grasp on what the author was trying to say. It was a big disappointment for I am one to accept stories with messages not however messages that are murky if not obscure. It was like going on a roller coaster waiting for the biggest and tallest hill and then there was none. Left to a stilted somewhat boring ride, you emerge with no sense of wonder but a sense of what the heck was that and where was my thrill?So here I will sit with a not so favorable outlook on this story. I have liked three of this author's books, particularly the book, Commonwealth, but unfortunately for me this book left be feeling as vacant and bereft as her characters seemed to be. 2.5 stars for me as well. What represents you as a person? Is it the people you know, the clothes you wear, or even the house you live in? Could it be in one's zeal to be acknowledged that the aforementioned things are really what makes the persona a person wishes to put forward. What happens to character, to strength, and to the willingness to help others, particularly family, as the components of what makes a person? In this book, Ann Patchett presents us with a family whose lives are tragic shells of what could have been. But is that enough to know, for in every tragedy there always emerges victors and perhaps in this book there are no victors whatsoever just losers in the game of life.

13,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4125660-liz,Rating 5 out of 5,"5 HUGE STARS! One of my best of 2019 (definitely the best audio book). I am a huge Ann Patchett fan and this book does not disappoint. It’s a fabulous book, but it was made so much better because of Tom Hank’s narration. The book is described as a dark fairy tale and there is definitely that theme, with an evil stepmother separating two siblings from their father, their house and everything they hold dear. The book just drew me in and I wanted to spend all my hours listening to it. Told from Danny’s viewpoint, we learn of how Andrea appears in their lives and usurps their inheritance. While I appreciated what Maeve and Danny had lost, I also kept waiting to see when they would move on with their lives. As time goes on, and it moves through five decades, the book becomes more about forgiveness and acceptance. While Maeve is often bitter, Danny at times just seems befuddled, a somewhat removed player in his own life. My thoughts about Celeste went back and forth. Maeve and Danny were so used to being each other’s emotional support, I could understood Celeste feeling left out. But her jealousy at times felt childish. Patchett’s strength comes from how she forms her characters. I never felt Danny and Maeve were anything but real flesh and blood people. In both cases, you see exactly how their childhood has made them the people they are. The same events, when seen through the difference of a few years, shapes them in unique ways. And that ending! I loved how this played out and what became of each of the main characters, how they reconciled themselves to their histories. What surprised me was how much humor was in this book. Not laugh out loud, but a subtle, dry humor that more closely mirrors real life. Again, Hanks totally captures the humor here. I hope he takes on more audio book assignments as he is so well suited to the work."
14,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s,Rating 4 out of 5,"Patchett is way up there on my, can't wait for next novel, list. Her characterizations, her insight into flawed families and her wry observations of human nature, are always top notched. In this, her soon to be published novel, she follows a family for five decades, a family that is broken apart, for reasons that I cannot at this time share. Brother and sister, Maeve and Danny, are extremely close, not unexpected since they are the only ones that are there for each other through thick and thin. Danny is our narrator, and from a young age, we are let into his thoughts and the actions of the other characters.Dutch House, a house that their father bought to surprise their mother, is as much a character in this story, as are the actual characters. It is the cause of much of what happens here, a house with huge window that allows one to see all through the house. We follow not only the house itself, but the brother and sister as they grow, through their triumphs and losses. Sibling strength and family loyalty.It is a novel of obsession but also of acceptance and forgiveness. The end, in a way comes full circle, but not without much heartache and loss. There were a few things that sparked the doubting Thomas in me, but all in all this is a wonderful read.Another read with Angela and Esil, and though our ratings do differ a bit, we all enjoyed this novel.ARC by Edelweiss."

I previously had only read Commonwealth and liked it, but it wasn't something I would climb to the top of a mountain and yell about. This book is.I'm not going to get into the summary because I went in as blind as I could (I requested an ARC on NG and EW purely on the fact that it was Ann Patchett and I LOVED the cover) and I think that benefited me. I had no expectations whatsoever. Within the first few pages I was hooked. Ms. Patchett's beautiful writing had my jaw on the floor. I am in awe of her talent and it played out so well in my mind that I was in that house with them. I was sitting next to them in the car. I was the fly on the wall. I was there.If you like books that make you feel a spectrum of emotions with a side of laughter for a few quirky characters - than this book is absolutely a MUST READ. I experienced being vehemently angry, to laughing out loud to such utter sadness...If this isn't made into a series on TV or a movie, I don't know what is wrong with people. The characters in this story (my favorite is Maeve hands down) are so complex and relatable and REAL. You hate them, you forgive them, you desperately love them. I cannot say enough good things about it. I love books that make me feel something and this one did, a million times over. Thank you to Edelweiss, Harpercollins and Ann Patchett for the opportunity to read and provide an honest review of this book.Review Date: 09/27/19Publication Date: 09/24/19"
16,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47571190-beata,Rating 4 out of 5,"I admit I was drawn to this novel by its gorgeous cover and narration by Tom Hanks as I have read only one book by Ms Patchett. I am not sure I will follow her, but this novel is absolutely fantastic. What an intriguing idea to tell a story of a family, especially of a strong bond between siblings, and connect it with a story of a house that seems to be in the background but which in fact plays the major role in the characters' lives! I live in a flat in a tenement house which was built over 90 years ago, love everything about it, appreciate the amount of work that went into decorting it and the attention to its quality, therefore the Dutch House at first seemed to me one of the most beautiful houses one can imagine. At the beginning I was confused: how can you hate such an architectural pearl? As the story progresses, we learn more about its former owners, how the Conroys came to own it, how Danny and Maeve were forced to leave it, and most importantly, how it influenced their mother and in consequence, the siblings. Then, I understood Ms Patchett's idea behind her story. And I loved it.For me, this was one of those novels that you start and you think you know what to expect, and then you are given a most unannounced treat."
17,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10171516-jessica,Rating 3 out of 5,"as far as family sagas go, this is pretty average. not amazing, but not horrible either. i mean, the story is interesting enough. i like the idea of how a house plays such a central role through everyones lives, the common denominator. i wish it had played a larger role in some parts, but overall, i like the connection it created. i also think the bond between maeve and danny is really quite lovely. i think, at its heart, this story has a lot to give. i just wish i had connected to it more. again, it kept my interest, but there wasnt really anything that made me love this. so fine overall, just not as emotionally compelling as i would have wanted from a family-oriented story.i would probably recommend ‘the hearts invisible furies’ instead. ↠ 3 stars"
18,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8655084-phrynne,Rating 5 out of 5,"Sometimes when you listen to an audiobook the narrator spoils it and sometimes makes it. This one is read by Tom Hanks and he makes it absolutely perfect. He has the kind of voice you can listen to for hours and it is ideal for Danny, the character whose point of view is followed throughout the book.The story is about the breakdown of a family and the support its individual members give to each other. Danny and his sister Maeve are the most important characters, and they have an amazing bond. I thought it was very interesting to observe the different ways they reacted to their lost mother. Maeve, who had known her for some of her childhood, longed for her return. Danny, who never really knew her, ended up being very like his father and repeated many of his faults. I have read several of this author's books now and have enjoyed all of them. She has a magic touch with characterisation and her books often read like top quality memoirs because the people in them are so real. The Dutch House is not plot driven or exciting. It moves slowly and beautifully and ends up almost where it began. I enjoyed it very much."
19,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7383561-holly,Rating 4 out of 5,"TOM HANKS NARRATES THIS AUDIOBOOK! I repeat, Tom Hanks narrates this audiobook! I could listen to that man narrate a grocery list but lucky for us, this book was much more interesting than that.Let me first warn you that this is absolutely a character study plot type novel. And by that I mean, don't go into this book expecting this to happen: beginning->story climax where something major happens->ending. Instead, the readers gets to wade through the lives of Danny and his older sister, Maeve. It's like literary voyeurism. This is something I personally enjoy (I even have a shelf for it!), but if that does not sound like the kind of story you want to read, you might want to skip this.Getting into the book itself - I *loved* the first 2/3 of the book, maybe even 3/4. So, as you can probably figure out, the ending is where I dropped my planned 5 star review down to a 4. I don't want to spoil any of the book, because when a book really isn't about anything in particular everything is a spoiler. But I can say that the ending left me wondering if the author was trying to tell the reader something about forgiveness and if so, I am way too much of a cynical grudge bearing asshole to jump on that forgiveness ship, both in books and in real life. So, there's that.But don't let my personal issues with the book ending dissuade you from LISTENING to this book. Because Tom Hanks. *dreamy sigh while I go watch You've Got Mail for the millionth time*"
20,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8665845-debbie,Rating 4 out of 5,"A grand house with grand siblings insideA house? Really? I want people, not inanimate objects! I thought the house would be bigger than the people in it, but thank god I was wrong. I ended up loving the place. Hell, I’d go to an open house there any day. Damn straight I’d like to snoop around.The cover and the title scared me. A painting of an uptight, upright woman on the cover, and “Dutch House” as the title—sounds like we might have some snooty going on here. Is reading this going to feel like being held prisoner in a museum? Because I’m here to tell you, museums are famous for keeping it dull, and I definitely smelled a museum. It just hit me that I wouldn’t have been putting on the brakes if the house were some funky, colorful place (with a chartreuse washstand and a periwinkle china cabinet)—in other words, a house I’d like to explore. A rich person’s house—high ceilings, mature rugs, huge art? Yawn city. But let’s face it, I would read anything Ann Patchett writes—uptight, upright, museum-y or not, I was all in. So I sighed and dug in, already mad that I was going to be dropped into dens of description! I needed an attitude adjustment, because of course this huge house, as I predicted, was being described in huge detail. Chill! I sat there all tense, poised and ready to jump ship if I had to. But immediately the writing adjusted my attitude, as Patchett did her typical skillful thing and grabbed me into her story. And we’re talking two pages in. I was hooked.This is the story of Danny and Mauve, a brother and sister who are joined at the hip. Danny is the narrator, and he’s just a kid when the story starts. I liked him immediately. Mauve takes care of Danny, and he adores her. All they have, really, is each other. When two siblings are alone against the world, they are imprinted on each other for life; the bond is greater than any other. Danny and Mauve fit the bill. Watching their devotion to each other was so touching. Their lives change suddenly (and the house is big during this fateful moment) and they need each other even more. The book follows them through five decades. As the kids became adults, I got more and more attached to them; I was invested in the choices they made and cringed more than once at their behavior. Patchett knows how to make you believe them, trust them, love them.The house is at first a grand place but all the sudden it isn’t. The house means different things to different people and it’s a constant in the book, always there for people to react to. Throughout the book, we have Danny and Mauve sitting in a car in front of the house, reminiscing. Right there, Patchett has me in the palm of her hand. Why on earth are they just sitting there? Can’t they go in? Why do they sit there time and again? Slowly the story gets revealed.I’ve been a Patchett fan for a long time, and every time I finish one of her books, I feel so completely satisfied (with the exception of Bel Canto). Yet I always sort of frown and try to figure out Patchett’s secret. Well, of course, there’s the fact that her writing is dynamite. And she creates nuanced characters, has a lot of insight into the human condition, and keeps the story moving along, usually rather quietly (there’s never over-the-top melodrama—never). Her presentation is complicated but smooth. We go back and forth in time, but she sets it up in a way that lets me happily accept the jumps.Patchett’s tone is pretty formal, which always puts me off at first because I worry it will keep me from feeling close to the characters; it will create a distance. But here’s the scoop: Maybe I can’t get super close because she’s got a wall up, but she gets me to peek over the wall to see the fascinating party she’s throwing, and it’s as good as a front-row seat. With all of her books, the formality soon becomes invisible to me and I am all in, attached to the characters and wanting to find out, right that minute, how they are going to fare. I desperately wanted to know how Danny’s and Mauve’s life would turn out. The story didn’t disappoint.In terms of scope, tone, setting, and depth, this book seems like a throwback to masterpieces written in the 1700s and 1800s; there is a classic and epic feel to it. Having a grand mansion as the setting helps. As in classics, Patchett does give lots of details of things that by themselves aren’t interesting, but she ends up painting a vivid picture that sets a perfect stage for the action going down, and you feel like you’re right there.This editor twitches a couple of times. There are a few tiny problems, which might be fixed by publication date:-Mauve’s workplace is described twice. Haven’t I read this before?-Kids don’t talk this way! Way too mature-sounding! Happened enough times to annoy me.-Common error: she said she “could have cared less” when she meant that she “couldn’t have cared less.”The reason I’m giving this book 4 stars instead of 5 is that I had trouble believing the mom. I just didn’t think what she did was realistic (plus I bigtime didn’t approve of it). Also, there is a theme of forgiveness at the end, which I also didn’t buy (or like). Even though there isn’t a religious theme going on, I think religion is a very tricky undercurrent.All in all, a good read, though. Patchett is a master.Thanks to Edelweiss for the advance copy."

We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we're not seeing it as the people we were, we're seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.""Siblings Danny and Maeve Conroy grew up in The Dutch House, a lavish home in the Philadelphia suburbs. Once the home of a Dutch family that owned most of the area, their artwork and interior decorating still remain throughout the infamous estate. While their real-estate-investor father loves the house and sees it as a jewel in his empire, their mother was repulsed by all the infamous home represented, and she left when Danny was very young.Left with a father generally incapable of doing more than providing the material comforts for his children, Maeve helped raise Danny, with the help of the family's two housekeepers. The two siblings, despite their age difference, formed an unshakable bond, one which became even more crucial when their father married again, this time a younger woman with two young daughters of her own. Their stepmother's dislike of them was apparent to them from the very start, although their father seemed oblivious and/or disinterested in her treatment of them, as he was more interested in keeping the peace in his household than anything else.When their stepmother gets the opportunity, she exiles Danny and Maeve from the house—and cuts off their access to any of the money that should be theirs. Left with nothing, they are forced to fend for themselves and have only each other to survive. And while they cannot seem to get The Dutch House out of their minds, given that it was such an enormous part of their lives, they want more than anything to understand the actions of their parents, which led them to where they are now. While this isn't a suspenseful book, there are a few surprises that are better to unfold as you read it rather than have them revealed. This is a book that was paced a lot slower than I like, but there is a lot of richness to behold, including emotion, nostalgia, family dynamics, and even a little humor. What fascinated me even more is what a major character the house itself played, much like in

The people are all just dreadful and I couldn’t care less what happens to them.Couldn’t waste any more time on this rubbish.
23,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/106692-cheri,Rating 5 out of 5,"4.5 StarsThis is the third book of Patchett’s that I’ve read, the first being State of Wonder,  the second, Commonwealth, and this is one adds to the proof that she was born to write these complex family dramas where each character equally shares the wounds of all involved.  A little like a fairy tale flipped upside-down, this story includes an imposing, castle-like house, which seems to affect each character differently, as though abiding inside these walls seems to create an entirely different relationship between the house and each character. It begins as World War II is ending, and this then poor young family who have been living in base housing, living a happy, if simple life find their world upended when the father, Cyril, buys a house – unbeknownst to his young wife and young daughter, Maeve. The wife, Elna, is… well, impressed by the house, but the impression isn’t a good one, and she can’t imagine how this house could be theirs when they are poor. Something must be wrong beyond her feeling that this is far too ostentatious for her to ever feel comfortable living in. As the story moves along, the house becomes more and more like another character, creating tension as time passes, and representing the failures of the past as well as the shattered hopes and dreams for the members of this family, as well. As time passes, it continues to pull both Danny and his sister Maeve back time and again to confront their feelings of anger and their regrets over the past. Narrated by the son, Danny, it seemed as though these were stories shared by and about real people, and imparted with the grace and dignity offered to cherished loved ones.

24,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3643764-esil,Rating 4 out of 5,"Awfully close to 5 stars!The Dutch House is full of the stuff I love in fiction. It’s really well written, has great characters, is original and feels like a big meaty story I could get lost in. Danny is the narrator. He grew up in the grandiose Dutch House with his sister, Maeve, and his father. What happens to his mother is a mystery that unravels over time. But the fallout from her disappearance is a very strong bond between Danny and Maeve, and a cascade of emotional and other consequences for everyone. At the centre of the novel is the house — loved and reviled depending on the character. In the end, there is a symmetry to the story that is emotionally wrought and complex. This is not an easy story with straightforward characters. But it’s very readable. I read this one as a buddy read with Angela and Diane, and it definitely works well as a buddy read because there’s much to discuss — especially the end. Thanks to Edelweiss and the publisher for an opportunity to read an advance copy."

From the masterful beginning until the perfect ending, and everything in between; the characters who feel like family, the Dutch house itself, the story which loops around and circles in upon itself, surprises, unexpected opportunities and also the letting go of hatred and revenge when there's no point in them anymore. I'm still not sure how I feel about the Mother, but I'll be dwelling on her for quite some time.I don't know exactly how Ann Patchett keeps on getting better and better, but she has taken grand storytelling to a new level."
26,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4514828-susanne,Rating 4 out of 5,"“Home.” What does it mean to you? It is a place or is it a person?  For me, having had a bad childhood and a bad marriage, “Home” has always been a place. Now that I’m divorced, the first home that I created for myself after my divorce was the first place that I ever truly felt safe in my entire life. Now, having moved, I have strived to create that same feeling of “Home” elsewhere. For others, “Home” may be the people you surround yourselves with.In “The Dutch House” by Ann Patchett, “the house” as such, plays a huge part of the story and everything revolves around it. For some of the characters in this novel, I believe that home is definitely a place.Danny and Maeve Conroy are siblings who live in The Dutch House with their parents until tragedy strikes and then the unthinkable happens and Danny and Maeve’s life changes drastically. Thereafter Danny and Maeve visit The Dutch House frequently albeit from the confines of Maeve’s car. Reflecting and reminiscing. Though their lives go on and decades pass, Danny and Maeve’s lives always revolve around The Dutch House, what has transpired over the years and what goes on inside on a daily basis. Thought provoking, engaging and heartbreaking, “The Dutch House” includes a whole host of complex characters and emotions. There are several themes in this book, including: acceptance; dysfunction; family; friendship; forgiveness; love; obsession; reconciliation and perseverance, to name a few. This book will evoke emotion, whether you like it or not. Frustration, anger, disgust, joy and/or love. I was wholly engrossed in the storyline and in the characters and every time a “shoe dropped” my jaw just about dropped as well. I grabbed the audiobook of this from my library and was delighted to find that TOM HANKS was the narrator! TOM freaking HANKS!!! He did a phenomenal job narrating and completely drew me into this story. What I can say is that I truly enjoyed this story and loved the characters of Danny and Maeve. I found certain aspects of the story to be a bit unbelievable given my personal background but I enjoyed the book nonetheless. While I preferred “Commonwealth,”I did enjoy this and would recommend it to fans of literary fiction. A huge thank you to my local library for loaning me a copy of this audiobook! Thank you to Tom Hanks for the stellar narration!Published on Goodreads on 10.18.20."
27,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68708752-beverly,Rating 5 out of 5,"Ann Patchett is one of my favorite authors. I haven't read all of her books, but I have read many of them that I love with my whole heart; Bel Canto, Run, Truth and Beauty are my favorites by her. The Dutch House is a five star read too. I was completely in love with her characters, especially Maeve and her brother Danny, who are essentially made orphans and paupers by the death of their father, the desertion by their mother, and their wicked stepmother who kicks Danny out of her home when he is only 15. Maeve has to take care of Danny and herself and she does an outstanding job. This is a novel about siblings who love each other and take care of each other which is something that is very rare in books.Another theme of the book, besides family devotion is the importance of working hard and studying hard. Maeve and Danny are hard workers and believe in education for its own sake. This is another reason why I love this book. At the heart of the book is their home, the one their father bought as a gift for their mother, that she rejected. The children survive despite the loss of their home and even their wicked stepmother is toothless at the end."
28,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36348070-brandice,Rating 4 out of 5,"Ann Patchett rarely disappoints and The Dutch House is no exception. This story spans several decades, beginning with siblings Danny and Maeve, in their childhood, growing up in the Dutch House, outside of Philadelphia. The story is told entirely from Danny’s perspective. He’s very close with Maeve, his older sister, as their mother, Elna, left when the children were young. The family was well-off and their father, Cyril, though not particularly warm, provided for and raised his two children, who couldn’t got a straight answer as to why Elna left, just hearing bits and pieces through others. I was frustrated on their behalf for the lack of answers. Cyril remarries Andrea, a woman with little regard for Danny and Maeve, even though she has two daughters of her own. When tragedy strikes, Andrea kicks Danny and Maeve out of the Dutch House, redirecting the course of their lives. The siblings grow even closer as they deal with the devastating blow of being thrown out of their home and try to forge on with their new life. Is a house really a home? Does karma exist? At what point, if ever, does forgive and forget happen? These are all questions indirectly posed in The Dutch House, where the house itself is a central character in the story. I liked both Danny and Maeve though at points, I recognized why their fierce loyalty to one another could be frustrating for others. Danny bent a bit too easily to Maeve’s wishes at times. I did enjoy the subtle sarcasm of Danny’s adult POV in the story. It never ceases to amaze me how talented of a writer Ann Patchett is - I’m a big fan and continue to marvel at how she writes such great stories, none of which are alike. I appreciate the variation of settings, different characters, and that her stories do not follow a set formula. While I didn’t love The Dutch House quite as much as Commonwealth or State of Wonder, I still really liked it and found the book to be a worthy read."

31,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28819314-eric-anderson,Rating 5 out of 5,"There are some novels where I instantly feel connected to the narrator as if he were an old friend. Something about the way Ann Patchett presents her central character of Danny Conroy in her new novel “The Dutch House” hooked me to his consciousness. Maybe it's the tone of his wide-eyed innocence and ignorance as he looks back at his childhood, family life and the home he was cast out of. It's a sensibility I can relate to now that I'm in my early 40s and think back to the mysteries of my early life wondering why certain decisions were made. Danny and his sister Maeve grow up in a grand house with a prosperous father, but their mother abandoned them in their childhood. When their father marries a new woman named Andrea who brings her own two daughters into the house, the Conroy children feel themselves growing even more estranged from their aloof father. In their teenage years they are unceremoniously ousted from their family home and must fend for themselves. Danny recounts this story and the haunting way he and his sister often linger outside the house they've been cast out of ruminating about the past and the truth about their family. In a way, every adult must feel this way reflecting on what Joyce Carol Oates calls “the lost landscape” of childhood. Patchett also poses a number of tantalizing mysteries about this particular family which kept me gripped and I admire the subtle way she raises lingering questions to do with the meaning of family, belonging and home.

34,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56035852-katie,Rating 2 out of 5,"I'm relieved to get this over and done with. In England we're very familiar with novels about enchanted houses. Off the top of my head there's Brideshead Revisited, Howard's End, Wuthering Heights, Jane Eyre, To the Lighthouse, The Tenant of Wildfall Hall, I Capture the Castle. All of them much better than this American take on the theme. A brother and sister are left by their mother. She leaves to help the poor in India. An utterly unconvincing plot device which was never given credence. Their father remarries a nightmare woman. The evil stepmother was by a country mile the best character in the book but unfortunately she doesn't occupy much of it. Mostly we see the brother and sister as adults, both of whom are dysfunctional where relationships are concerned, something they share with every other character in the novel. They share an incestuous relationship in all but deed. Neither has a glamorous or creative job. And the problem for me was they simply weren't interesting. We learn little about them of interest. Why didn't Maeve, the daughter, ever have a love relationship? There's lots and lots of mundane domestic detail in this novel but little insight. There was at least one whole chapter that could have been taken out without losing any relevant information. There's also no humour. Patchett's prose is neat and tidy but without risk or adventure. The resolution was hackneyed. Objectively, it isn't a bad book (I don't think it's a particularly good one either) but when characters you're supposed to sympathise with bore and irritate you there's no getting past it."
35,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5464046-porshajo,Rating 4 out of 5,"I a big fan of Ann Patchett. I've read a number of her books, saw her speak a few times, even went to her bookstore while on a work trip through Nashville. Needless to say, there was no doubt I would read this one and like it. I've yet to read anything that she writes and not like it. I still have a few of her books to read (that I have copies of, even signed copies of books) but feel like I don't want to rush. I always want to have one of her books available to read. I know it's odd. But on to The Dutch House.The Dutch House is a slow moving family story, a sad family story. The story goes back and forth in time, over five decades, telling us about the lives of Danny and Maeve Conroy. Danny and Maeve grew up, to a point, in The Dutch House. As with any Ann Patchett story, I wanted it to end a different way. Perhaps that's just me. You hear from the time when Danny and Maeve are small children, until very much later in life, and that house. The Dutch House plays such a strong role in the story, but also in the lives of anyone who has been in that house. It has this pull, this allure, that Danny and Maeve are almost, many times, living the in past and remembering their time in that house. Even though the story is one of such a fractured family, the bond between Danny and Maeve are so strong. It kept me pushing to finish to hear more.As soon as it was available, I begged my library for the audio version. I was the first to get it! Yeah! Tom Hanks narrated the story. At first, I thought I might not like the narration. I love Tom Hanks (who doesn't) but was afraid it would just not work. I thought he did a good job, sometimes I thought maybe a bit much. But I was so drawn into the story. I often listen while working in the kitchen and was looking for things to do, just so I could hear more. The story was quite slow at times but I liked it (hence 4 stars). I can't say this is my favorite of hers. Bel Canto will forever be my favorite. One I should probably re-read, or perhaps one of her's I'm savoring on my shelves will be next in line."

With The Dutch House it took me nearly two weeks to work up the ‘courage’ to review it. The fact is that I loved The Dutch House so much that I find hard to see it as a ‘mere’ work of fiction.This is the eighth novel that I’ve read by Ann Patchett and she has yet to disappoint. It is difficult to ‘pick’ a favourite, even if I can see that throughout the course of her writing career she has really honed her craft. Yet, I wholeheartedly loved her early books (especially her unjustly underrated 1997 novel, The Magician's Assistant), so to imply that she ‘keeps getting better’ would be doing her a disservice. Regardless of the scope of her stories (whether they take place in a short period of time in a particular city, such as in Run, or move us between two ‘extremes’, in The Magician's Assistant we move between Los Angeles and Nebraska, or take us on even longer journey, for instance in State of Wonder we follow Dr. Marina Singh’s as she leaves Minnesota for the Amazon Rainforest) Patchett tends to explore the same themes: there is a focus on familial relationships, especially between siblings, and these established dynamics are often changed due to some ‘major’ event (often the death of a loved one/relative/colleague). Although The Dutch House is written in Patchett’s signature prose, which can be described as being deceptively simple it features a first-person perspective, which is a departure from her usual third-person point of view. Being inside Danny Conroy’s head makes for an immersive experience and within the first pages I was captivated by his story. Through an act of retrospection Danny looks back to the past and what follows is a narrative that could be described as a bildungsroman. Danny’s childhood in the Dutch House—a large, if not incongruous, mansion in a prosperous suburb of Philadelphia—is clouded by the absence of his mother (a woman he cannot clearly recall but whose absence he nonetheless feels) and by his relationship with his remote father. It is Maeve, Danny’s older sister, who takes on the role of ‘parental’ figure, and their relationship is very much the underlying thread of the story. The Dutch House, weighed down by its history, inspires fascination in Andrea, the woman who will go on to become Danny and Maeve’s step-mother. The novel begins in fact with Danny’s memory of his first meeting with Andrea, one that seems to have almost a fairy-tale-esque quality in that it was the day where ‘everything’ seemed to change.Throughout Danny’s narrative we will also see the way in which the Conroy siblings remain drawn to the house, a house which seems to acquire an emblematic role in the lives of those who have lived in: it represents their childhoods, their father—his career, his marriage(s)—and the rather unfortunate VanHoebeeks. Patchett renders this house without loosing herself in extensive architectural descriptions, rather she brings to the foreground some of its features (Maeve's windowseat) and some of its objects. The paintings within the house (Maeve's portrait and those of the VanHoebeeks) also seem to hold a certain function in Danny's recollection of his past.“Maybe it was neoclassical, though with a simplicity in the lines that came closer to Mediterranean or French, and while it was not Dutch, the blue delft mantels in the drawing room, library, and master bedroom were said to have been pried out of a castle in Utrecht and sold to the VanHoebeeks to pay a prince’s gambling debts. The house, complete with mantels, had been finished in 1922.”In his remembrance Danny frequently makes vague, if not downright oblique, allusions to later events or revelations, which in turn creates tension between his past and present. Also framing Danny's recollection of his youth are a series of scenes in which he sits in alongside Maeve in her car just outside the Dutch House.Danny also questions the veracity of his memories: “But we overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.” He reassess certain moments and figures of his past, finding hidden complexities in what had at first appeared to be seemingly unremarkable occurrences.“Do you think it’s possible to ever see the past as it actually was?”While the novel is narrated by Danny he never paints himself as the ‘hero’ of his own story. He often wonders whether he should have acted in a different way towards someone or something, trying to understand why things unfurled the way that they did. While the motivations of other characters might escape him-and possibly us-they are never reduced to a certain role/function. The each have a story even if we are not always made privy to it. An although there is an awareness of the limitations provided by Danny's narration, the story never feels restricted to his experiences and worldview. “Whatever romantic notions I might have harbored, whatever excuses or allowances my heart had ever made on her behalf, blew out like a match.”My edition of The Dutch House includes an essay in which Ann Patchett says that “for a long time I had planned to call the book Maeve as it was her story.” The novel, in fact, very much pivots around Maeve but it is her brother who is telling her tale.We see the way in which their experiences in the Dutch House makes them determined to fulfil their desires or to take a certain path in their life: for Danny that is to become, as his father before him, a real-estate developer, while Maeve wants to carry on working a job she loves even if many consider her to be overqualified to do. While to some degree Danny's vision of Maeve influences our perception of her, we are always aware that she may have hidden qualities. What is certainly undeniable is her love for her brother. Their bond is portrayed with such frankness and poignancy as to become vividly real in the reader’s mind.This a story full of beauty and sorrow. There are regrets, wonderful reflections on memory, moments that are brimming with love or sadness...Patchett spins a tale in which families fall apart or come together. It is an intimate depiction of the bond between two siblings. Time and again Danny draws strength from his relationship to his sister, and even when he begins to feel unmoored from his own life, and as he struggles trying to reconcile himself with his past, Maeve provides him with a sense of belonging.Patchett's sense of place is as detailed and evocative as ever. She seamlessly renders midcentury America through Danny's narration, evoking within me a sense of nostalgia for a country I've never even been to. And while Danny's story spans decades, it maintains its focus on the same group of people, painting an intimate portrait of Danny's friends and family....to put it simply I fell in love with it. Patchett's harmonious prose made the experience all the more beautiful, and I was so enthralled by her story and her characters that to I struggled to think of them as works of fiction.What more can I say? I think this is a masterpiece.“We had made a fetish out of our misfortune, fallen in love with it. I was sickened to realize we’d kept it going for so long, not that we had decided to stop.”Read more reviews on my blog / / / View all my reviews on Goodreads"

I loved all the characters (including the house) and how Ann Patchett portrayed them in all their humanity. Even though the story, told by Danny, the Conroy son and brother to Maeve, goes back and forth in time over five decades, I found it quite easy to follow. When friends favorably reviewed this audiobook, narrated by Tom Hanks no less (my favorite actor!), I couldn't resist! If you enjoy ""character"" stories, then I highly recommend this book!"
38,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4271946-jessica-woodbury,Rating 5 out of 5,"I cannot explain why Ann Patchett is so good because while I read her books, I am so engrossed and involved that I do not have the capability to figure it out. That would mean letting go of the story, slowing down or stopping, not letting myself get pulled along deeper and deeper. Her prose and her plots are often (though not always) simple. I cannot tell why I am absolutely mesmerized, I just am. It is simply something to be accepted, and something to be treasured.THE DUTCH HOUSE left me with an emotional hangover I still haven't quite recovered from a day later. It worked its slow, sneaky magic on me until I was at its mercy. At first I did not quite see where it would take me, a few plot twists surprised me, but by the last third even when I knew exactly what was going to happen I felt helpless, watching, weeping, carried along by its tide. The themes of the novel are ones that hit me very deeply, which certainly added to my experience. The mystery of parents to their children, the way we see others' mistakes so clearly and then make the very same mistakes ourselves, the way the experience inside a single family can feel drastically different to everyone in it. And on top of all of that is a question of forgiveness, its blessings and its limits. Forgiveness is something I think about a lot, as I am very very bad at it, but this story is not entirely sold on it either and the sometimes-arbitrary way we deem some people worthy of forgiveness and others absolutely undeserving is one of those tricks of human nature the novel uses to full effect.Danny, our narrator, begins the novel as a child. His mother has left so long ago he barely remembers her. His father is distant. His sister Maeve, seven years older, is his parent and his closest confidant. Their father is in real estate, and they live in the titular house, an architectural marvel in the Philadelphia suburbs in the mid-20th century, filled with the belongings of the prior inhabitants, the kind of people who have giant portraits of themselves hanging on the wall. As the novel starts, their father brings home a woman, bringing a massive change to the small family. Maeve is the center of the story, and she remains throughout Danny's life the center of his world. As their family changes and then crumbles, Maeve is all that Danny has and she is devoted to his success. While Maeve loves Danny deeply, she also uses him as a tool to take out her revenge against their stepmother, something Danny is not all that interested in doing, but he doesn't put up much of a fight. Over the years they try to learn more about their closed-off father and their missing mother, needing to build up a family mythology and a deeper understanding of how it all went wrong. By the end of the novel, this small story has taken on an epic scale. I love it when a domestic plot can take on the kinds of choices and betrayals that lead to overwhelming emotions. Patchett does that so well in this book, slowly laying the groundwork, making the stakes clear, sketching the characters in minute detail, so when you reach the end you may find yourself unable to stop reading, sobbing on the couch. (Or maybe that's just me.) A rewarding, fulfilling novel.Update: Re-read in 2023 and... it definitely didn't hit the same for me for whatever reason. This time I was so annoyed at adult Danny, rolling my eyes at how he romanticized being a landlord, frustrated at how he is constantly cared for by everyone in his life and never appreciates it. I do like the fairy tale nature of it, and Patchett is so weirdly good at jumping around in time. "

I only understood what I'd lost."" With The Dutch House, Ann Patchett has created a story that jumps off the page. Fully realized characters and one of the BEST sibling relationships I've ever read about in 337 short pages. And it didn't need to be any longer. It was absolutely perfect.This is the story of a house and its inhabitants. It's really Danny's story most, which I loved. When I read Patchett's previous novel  Commonwealth, which I really enjoyed, I wished it had a bit more focus. It spreads itself across many more perspectives, and while the writing is strong—just as it is here—the pacing waxes and wanes as the stories unfold. In this novel, however, we only ever hear from Danny. He's an endearing, empathetic, but not always to be trusted narrator. But his qualms are understandable as he's been through childhood trauma that reverberates through decades as we follow him and his sister Maeve grow up and away from their childhood home.In ways this reminded me of  The Goldfinch—thematically, stylistically, but also with this inimitable quality of feeling. This book was a book of feelings: rage and sympathy and small joys and sorrows that make up a complicated life.Patchett has her pulse on human emotion unlike many authors, and in this novel she's both prodded the wound and provided the salve. It's quite a feat and one I'll be contemplating for a long time."
41,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2172096-barbara,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5 starsThe lives of siblings Danny and Maeve Conroy are overshadowed by their childhood home, 'The Dutch House', an elegant glass mansion located in Elkins Park - a ritzy suburb of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The house, which looks more like a museum than a residence, was built by the Dutch VanHoebeeks in the 1920s, and purchased - complete with furniture and home décor - by budding real estate mogul Cyril Conroy in 1946. Cyril is delighted to surprise his young family with the house, not knowing it will affect their lives in unpredictable ways. Danny Conroy, who narrates the book as an adult, describes the three-story house as ""a singular confluence of talent and luck that was too much house for anyone"".....but that felt just right to him and Maeve. From certain angles, ""the house seemed to float several inches above the hill it sat on"" and ""the panes of glass that surrounded the glass front door were as big as storefront windows and held in place by wrought iron vines."" The blue Delft mantelpieces in the drawing room, library, and master bedroom were “said to have been pried out of a castle in Utrecht and sold to the VanHoebeeks to pay a prince’s gambling debts.” The house also boasted silk chairs, tapestry ottomans, oil paintings, Chinese lamps, marble floors, gilt ceilings, egg and dart molding, a large ballroom, imposing portraits of Mr. and Mrs. VanHoebeek, a swimming pool, and much more. The first casualty of the Dutch house is Danny and Maeve's mother, Elna, a humble woman who feels compelled to do good works. Elna is profoundly oppressed by the opulent house, and runs off to India to help the poor when Danny is three and Maeve is ten.Since dad Cyril is more involved with his business than his children, Danny and Maeve are largely brought up by housekeeper/cooks Sandy and Jocelyn. The women are conscientious and affectionate caretakers, but they aren't mothers, and Maeve essentially steps into this role for her brother. For her part, Maeve is inconsolable at the loss of her mom, and in addition to general malaise develops diabetes - which the family attributes to Elna's desertion. In time Cyril meets a woman named Andrea, who's mesmerized by the Dutch house. Cyril isn't particularly interested in Andrea, but she slyly inveigles herself into his life, marries him, and moves in with her daughters Norma and Bright. The children - Danny, Maeve, Norma, and Bright - get along like a house afire, but Danny and Maeve never warm up to Andrea.....or she to them. Sadly, as soon as Andrea moves in, she makes it her business to disenfranchise Danny and Maeve.Right after Maeve leaves for Barnard College in New York, for instance, Andrea usurps Maeve's lovely bedroom for Norma and Bright. And when Cyril and Danny plan an excursion to New York to have lunch with Maeve and explore buildings, Andrea invites herself and her girls along AND changes the itinerary to accommodate her own interests. (This doesn't work out so well for Andrea though. 😊)Cyril dies at 53, when 22-year-old Maeve has graduated college and 15-year-old Danny is in high school. Andrea promptly throws Danny out, calling Maeve to come and get him. The angry, hurt siblings set up housekeeping in Maeve's apartment in a nearby town, where Maeve works as an accountant/manager for a frozen vegetable company. Danny and Maeve retrieve very little from the Dutch house, not even family heirlooms or Maeve's portrait, which was commissioned by her father. As it turns out, Danny and Maeve are left with almost nothing. It seems Andrea managed to get EVERYTHING in her name: the Dutch house; Cyril's business; and Cyril's money. (One wonders what Cyril - and his lawyer - were thinking. 😒)Cyril never made a will, and the only thing left specifically for the children (Danny, Maeve, Norma, and Bright) is a trust fund for their education. Danny had planned to join (and eventually inherit) his dad's real estate business, which Andrea promptly sells. So - out of spite - Maeve insists that Danny attend Choate boarding school, then Columbia University, then Columbia Medical School.....all of which are very expensive schools. (FYI: Combined tuition and expenses would cost more than a million dollars in today's money). Andrea is infuriated by Danny draining the education fund, but is helpless to intervene. ChoateColumbiaThough Danny and Maeve no longer have any ownership in the Dutch house, they're inexorably drawn back. The siblings periodically park in front of the house, lambaste Andrea, and reminisce about their lives there.They talk about their mother, their step-sisters Norma and Bright, the housekeepers Sandy and Jocelyn, their bamboozled father, Danny's future, etc. Maeve wants Danny to be a doctor but - though he's training in the medical field - Danny continues to dream of going into real estate. Even in later years, when Danny and Maeve are adults with numerous responsibilities, they occasionally 'visit' the Dutch house.We follow Danny and Maeve for several decades, during which a lot happens: marriage, children, career advancement, new homes, squabbles, chance meetings, re-acquaintances, illness, death.....the usual drama of life. Through it all, Danny and Maeve remain the most important people in each other's lives. No matter what he's doing, Danny always longs to step away and call Maeve; and the only person Maeve loves more than Danny is her departed mother. The story is by no means a tragedy, and no one is out on the street dressed in rags and starving. In fact, from an outside point of view, Danny and Maeve lead very successful lives. The siblings' own dearest wish would probably be to toss Andrea out on her ear....but, as the Rolling Stones sing, ""No, you can't always get what you want; you can't always get what you want; but if you try sometime you find, you get what you need."" The Rolling StonesBy the end of the book, things in Elkins Park come full circle....but in an unexpected way.The book is rather slow-moving for my taste, but I was invested in the story and found the characters memorable, so - for me - the novel was worth reading.

It tells the story of a brother and sister over the course of five decades.At the end of the Second World War, Cyril Conroy combines luck and a single canny investment to begin an enormous real estate empire, propelling his family from poverty to enormous wealth. His first order of business is to buy the Dutch House, a lavish estate in the suburbs outside of Philadelphia. Meant as a surprise for his wife, the house sets in motion the undoing of everyone he loves.The story is told by Cyril’s son Danny, as he and his older sister, the brilliantly acerbic and self-assured Maeve, are exiled from the house where they grew up by their stepmother. The two wealthy siblings are thrown back into the poverty their parents had escaped from and find that all they have to count on is one another. It is this unshakable bond between them that both saves their lives and thwarts their futures.Set over the course of five decades, The Dutch House is a dark fairy tale about two smart people who cannot overcome their past. Despite every outward sign of success, Danny and Maeve are only truly comfortable when they’re together. Throughout their lives, they return to the well-worn story of what they’ve lost with humor and rage. But when at last they’re forced to confront the people who left them behind, the relationship between an indulged brother and his ever-protective sister is finally tested.عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: ‏‫«خانه‌ ی هلندی»؛ «عمارت هلندی»؛ نویسنده: آن پچت؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش روز بیست و سوم ماه سپتامبر سال2019میلادیعنوان: ‏‫خانه‌ ی هلندی؛ نویسنده: آن پچت‮‬‏��؛ مترجم منا اختیاری؛ تهران، آموت، 1398؛ در 416ص؛ شاب9786003841628؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده 21معنوان: عمارت هلندی؛ نویسنده آن پچت؛ ‏‫مترجم یاسمن ثانوی؛ ویراستار کاوه عزیزی؛ تهران، روزگار، 1399؛ در 352ص؛ شابک9786222330958؛عنوان: عمارت هلندی؛ نویسنده: آن پچت؛ مترجم الهام جمالی‌پویا؛ تهران، کتاب مرو، 1400، در 377ص؛ شابک9786227384178؛عنوان: عمارت هلندی (کوتاه شده)؛ نویسنده آن پچت؛ مترجم نازنین صابری؛ تهران، آسمان نیلگون؛ 1400؛ در 76ص؛ شابک9786227633375؛داستان برادری و خواهری در پنج دهه است؛ «خانه ی هلندی یا عمارت هلندی» ساختمانی‌ در پارک «الکینز، پنسیلوانیا» در حومه ی «فیلادلفیا» است؛ خانواده ی «فن هوبیک»، زن و شوهری با اصالت «هلندی»، که دارایی خود را از صنعت دخانیات، به دست آورده بودند، آن خانه را در سال1922میلادی ساخته اند، ملّاکی خودساخته و پیروز، به نام «سیریل کانروی»، در سال 1946میلادی، آن ساختمان را خرید، تا همسرش «النا» را غافلگیر کند؛ فرزندان آنها، «دنی» و «مِیو» در «خانه ی هلندی» بزرگ شدند؛ «النا»، «خانه ی هلندی» را دوست ندارد، و آنگاه که «دنی» سه ساله و «مِیو» ده ساله است، خانواده‌ اش را رها می‌کند، تا به فقرای «هند» یاری رساند؛ پس از درگذشت «سیریل»، نامادری بچه‌ها «آندره»، «دنی» و «میو» را از خانه بیرون می‌کند، این خواهر و برادر که دیگر کسی را ندارند، باید به همدیگر تکیه نمایند؛ «میو» با باقیمانده ی ارثیه‌ شان، «دنی» را به مدرسه ی شبانه‌ روزی «چوت رزمری هال»، دانشگاه «کلمبیا» و دانشکده پزشکی می‌فرستد؛ «دنی»، با اینکه علاقه‌ ای به پزشکی ندارد، برای خوشآیند «میو» دانشکده پزشکی را به پایان می‌رساند؛ راوی این رمان «دنی کانروی» در بزرگسالی‌ خویشتن استتایخ بهنگام رسانی 01/07/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"

At times, the description of the Dutch House and it’s importance for the characters throughout their lives reminded me of the large old house we grew up in. Our house was known by the name of one of the early owners who became famous, and everyone in our small town referred to it as such. It was a beautiful old home with a ton of character, and one that needed even more work when our family moved in. But, it was the spot for many of our best memories of our childhood, and it’s the only house that I occasionally return to as time goes by. Definitely recommend the audiobook, Tom Hanks was fantastic. Enjoy!"

'The Dutch House' refers to a mansion Meave and Danny live with their parents. We go through the lives of these siblings from their childhood to quite late in their lives. Their mother leaves suddenly without a word one day when they were children, and they never knew why. We go through the next phase of their lives after this event till they are old basically. If you haven't read Ann Patchett before, you need to know that her books are very much character driven, not plot driven. We go through the life span of a family and witness their lives. In this book, the focus was the 2 siblings and their tight relationship. Meave and Danny were a delight to follow. I even envied their unshaken closeness and love for each other as an only child :) They go through a lot together and their support for each other helps them achieve in life. Of course there are lots of other characters, but they are revolving around this brother & sister. I love Patchett's writing. It's very slow, but very immersive. Before you know it, you're drawn to these characters and want to know what's going on in their simple lives. I . was thinking of the book when I wasn't reading it, and wanted to return to it for sure. For people who love slow, character driven stories that goes on for a lifetime, Ann Patchett is the address :) The Waterstones edition with its sprayed edges is a delight! And, the book cover is exquisite. Not only it's beautiful. but it's very related to the book, so it makes it extra special."

With each book I fall ever more in love with the elegance of her writing, it’s the kind I melt into, that carries me along the plot line, which seems simple on the surface, meeting characters along the way that I soon come to regard as family with the range of emotions that implies. And even when I don’t particularly like the ending, I accept that it is as it should be.This is a timeless plot with unforgettable characters, but it is the house that looms large in both its physical presence and in the characters’ emotional and often obsessive attachment to it. Ann offers a perfectly paced and intimate portrait of family, loss and longing and will leave you to ponder the essential question posed, do you think it is ever possible to see the past as it actually was?Love doesn’t begin to cover my feelings about this book.

In my world things go wrong, people make mistakes, people struggle to be accepted, to be understood, to be loved, to pay the bills. Bloddy hell, in my world people even struggle to get out of bed each morning. The thing is, I come from a very big family and life has been hard for most of the time for all of us. Isolation, uneducated and exploited children, too many pregnancies, teenage pregnancies, disabilities, bullying, hunger, financial problems, cancer, depression, drug abuse, Alzheimer’s, suicide (and more). There was always a “story” about one of these topics in my life (sometimes more than one at the same time. Can you believe it?). We, as a family, have seen all of this. We know of these things not simply because we’ve heard about them but because we’ve been there. We know how it feels. Oh, yes, life is hard. Sometimes unbearably hard. And this is why I didn’t believe any of this. Well, to be clear and fair, I didn’t believe in a single world Ann Patchett has written down here. I believe Mrs Patchett simply didn’t know. She heard it all in the news. It’s not her fault that she has been lucky. Luck plays a big role in this game called life, you know…Mrs Patchett might have done some research on real estate and law but for me that didn’t make for a more believable storyline anyway. She’d put her characters in a certain difficult situation and then, because she didn’t really know how things happen in the real world, she jumps forwards in time and (abracadabra) everything’s sorted. Then she jumps in time again, this time backwards and tells us about another difficult situation in the characters lives but only to jump forward again in time and (abracadabra) we’ll find everything is sorted again. When she wasn’t solving things jumping in time, she would add an unbelievable coincidence or create a convenient new character and easily sort things out (again). Clever, hum?! While reading this book, I actually never knew how things played out, I just learned that they did. When Mrs Patchett finally stopped using this annoying literary device its was already too late and I didn’t really give a damn about what happened or not to all these people. Later on, Mrs Patchett went back to her favourite way of sorting things out and she managed to annoy me even more by telling me “two weeks later” that she killed one of the main characters. Ahahah. If all this had happened to real human beings they would have pulled out all the hair from their own heads. They would have screamed and shouted. They would have cried for mercy. It’s human nature. And this takes us to what was missing here and what I wanted to see, what I think was needed to tell a story like this; Humanity. Three stars only because this was a quick and easy read and the writing wasn’t that bad. This was my introduction to Ann Patchett’s writing and I’ve had enough of her already. She definitely adds too much sugar for my taste. No more for me, thank you very much."

Paintings of the Dutch couple, Mr. and Mrs. VanHoebeek (“Van-who-bake”), dominate the drawing room and a portrait of Maeve, at ten in her bright red coat, hangs on the opposite wall. That’s the cover of the book, which is great.The story is told in a circular fashion. It opens with their father bringing home a woman, Andrea, to meet his children. Their mother had left, returned, left, returned, and finally left for good. The two servants, Sandy and Jocelyn, have been raising the children, who are comfortable with things the way they are. Maeve is fifteen, Danny, eight. Andrea is obviously smitten with the grand house but seems less enthusiastic about Cyril’s children. Maeve is already a head taller than the tiny widow, and later, when they discover Andrea has two little girls, there is even less likelihood she will view them favourably.”Though the story will be remembered that Maeve and Andrea were at odds right from the start, that wasn’t true. Maeve was perfectly fair and polite when they met, and she remained fair and polite until doing so was no longer possible.”Cyril has become a successful property developer and Danny loves going with him to inspect buildings and building sites and collect the rents from tenants. He looks forward to taking over the company one day. He’s learning how to fix taps, patch cracks, work with his hands.“’The only way to really understand what money means is to have been poor,’ he said to me when we were eating lunch in the car. ‘That’s the strike you have against you. A boy grows up rich like you, never wanting for anything, never being hungry’—he shook his head, as if it had been a disappointing choice I’d made—'I don’t know how a person overcomes a thing like that.’”He loves his dad, but it’s Maeve who is the gravitational force around which he orbits. They are fiercely loyal to each other, an unbreakable unit against the world. Maeve manages his life.I found Danny completely self-absorbed, worrying mostly about himself and Maeve, but taking little real interest in anyone else. He loves playing basketball with friends, but they aren’t part of the story. It’s interesting to read about children growing up in post-war Pennsylvania and how a war veteran like their father managed to establish himself. It is not interesting to have scene after scene after scene of Maeve and Danny talking about the house and picking at the scabs on the wounds caused by Andrea, and before that, their mother’s disappearance. It’s all about Danny, and I wasn’t that crazy about him. I understand the popular audio book is narrated by Tom Hanks. The voice in my head was a bit petulant sometimes, more like Steve Carell's character from the American version of The Office, when Maeve was talking Danny into something. [I must admit, I haven't heard the Hanks rendition, and he's such a good actor, I know he can complain as well as anyone. But he's better known for being likeable and smart.]I lost interest as time went on. I found the strength of Maeve’s influence a bit much to swallow. I don’t want to give any spoilers, so I’ll just say that the alliances that formed later and the resolution of some of the relationships seemed to tie up the loose ends too neatly and unrealistically, for me. But don’t take my word for it. This is a very popular book, and you may love it as so many others have. I enjoyed it enough to round up to four stars rather than down to three.Thanks to NetGalley and Bloomsbury for the preview copy from which I’ve quoted."
51,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25472453-christy,Rating 3 out of 5,"Tom Hanks as narrator... YES PLEASE!! I will listen to anything he reads -- I just love him so much! I feel like the main character in this book is literally the house -- The Dutch House. Cyril Conroy builds an extremely successful real estate business, literally a rags to riches story. His children are Maeve and Danny. Danny is the narrator of the family story. Cyril buys the house as a gift for his wife, Elna, who ends up hating everything it stands for. She later abandons her family when the children are still very young. She can't stand the house, living in it, or being waited on while there are poor people all over the world that need help. When their father later dies, the children are kicked out of the house by their horrible step mother, Andrea. They are forced to rely on one another, and I loved hearing about how deep their sibling bond was for life. The house is literally the downfall for every character in the story at some point, and neither sibling can let it go and move on. They are always coming back to it, even if it is just to set outside of it and reminisce. Unpopular opinion: I didn't love this one like I expected. I typically love family stories that span many decades, but this one fell flat for me. However, it was definitely beautifully written and started off strong. I was super into the beginning, and then I felt myself just wanting it to be over. Much of it seemed so unrealistic and I just got very bored."
52,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25667717-doug,Rating 5 out of 5,"A HUGE thanx to Netgalley and HarperCollins for a review copy of this book, in exchange for this honest review. I've only read two other Patchett books, but she has already become a favorite author, and I was very excited to be granted this ARC months prior to its publication in late Sept., since her last novel, Commonwealth, made it into my top 5 reads for 2016 - and I am fairly confident this one will do likewise for 2019.The storyline follows somewhat similar ground as that previous book, being, more or less, an intricate family saga covering decades of the ins and outs of the Conroy family, and in particular, how the titular family manse outside Philadelphia impacts and impedes various relationships. The focus is primarily on a pair of siblings, with younger brother Danny doing the narrating, and once again Patchett does not follow a linear chronology, but weaves the stories back and forwards from the late 40's to the early 2000's. I sometimes had trouble following this in her previous book, since there was a plethora of characters to keep straight, but this is an easier go, since there are really only about a dozen characters in total. Although Patchett's prose is not fussy or overtly calls attention to itself, it always flows beautifully and is a pleasure to luxuriate in. Just the kind of lovely, leisurely read one wants/needs for the beginning of summer. I hope it is a tremendous success for her."

I wouldn't have appreciated this tale if I read it on paper since very little happens. I didn’t dislike it but I also couldn’t give t 4 stars as there’s nothing in particular that stayed with me. Do I get why this book is so popular? No. But it was an interesting read nonetheless. I can see why it’s popular among book clubs, lots of things to discuss. "
54,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59050228-meike,Rating 4 out of 5,"Now Nominated for the Women's Prize for Fiction 2020This family saga is compulsively readable and highly accessible, but not without depth: While the story is narrated from the point of view of Danny Conroy, the main protagonist is his sister Maeve who, after their father dies and their stepmother throws them out of the house, raises and takes care of her little brother. The title-giving Dutch House is the Conroy's former family home and becomes an obsession for the siblings who associate it with their lost childhood, a manifestation of their enigmatic past. Throughout their lives, the mansion exerts a gravitational pull, both as an idea and as a physical place: Danny and Maeve visit the house, but do not enter it, as their stepmother continues to live there. Patchett follows the Conroy siblings over decades, and the story is pushed forward by the riddles of their family history: What happened to their biological mother after she left the family? What happened to the nanny and the rest of the staff working for the family, what became of their stepsisters? What will become of Danny and Maeve who are now by themselves? Two narrative devices are particularly striking: The author remixes classic fairy tales (the siblings searching for their way home (Danny's wife even mentions ""Hänsel und Gretel""), the evil stepmother etc.) and works with the motif of the double. Characters often form pairs, most obviously the Conroy siblings themselves, and when a third party enters the picture, it gets complicated. Loyalty and selflessness are main topics of the book. The book is most interesting when Patchett hints at the subjective feelings of guilt and anger and at the flaws of the characters: Danny is a victim of the circumstanes, but frequently oblivious to the plight of those who try to help him; Maeve is struggling to find a balance between living her own life and protecting her brother; and many other characters are also torn between conflicting feelings and interests (I don't want to spoil the plot points that keep readers invested in the story). While the language is not particularly inventive or lyrical, it is still addictive and manages to create an absorbing atmosphere. Also, there are some aspects of the story that don't quite ring true and/or have an soap opera-like quality, but the story is so intriguing that it doesn't matter all that much. Patchett plants many ideas and develops them throughout the story (the meaning of a house as a home, illness and trauma, portraits as a means to reveal and capture people, the role of religion/Catholicism, the toxicity of unresolved conflicts, forms of love and selflessness), but the text is very easy to follow and reads quickly. So all in all, maybe not the biggest literary masterpiece ever written, but this book is very intelligent entertainment and fun to read.

I did hesitate with one star, because it's not a bad book, Ann Patchett is a perfectly good writer, but I did not like this and my ratings are personal. (I've read three of her other books, hated one (Bel Canto) and felt lukewarm about the others.) I thought this had promise at the start. But soon it began to drag, and I began to really dislike our narrator, Danny. I didn't even believe the characters of the mother and evil stepmother. The only likable person was Maeve, and yes, she was good and dependable and kind, etc., everyone should be so lucky to have a Maeve, but how interesting to read about? For me, not very. If you are going to read a novel with pretty much no plot, you better enjoy the heck out of the characters because that's all you're going to get. And I didn't. But, hey, great cover."

This is an intelligent novel that is almost a fable including an evil stepmonster but it’s the house that looms large. A house that represents success, greed, loss, sadness and, ultimately, forgiveness. A wife is desperately unhappy, close siblings are eventually ousted and many lives are deeply affected by the house and what it means to each character. Patchett has a deft touch and now I’ll have the pleasure of reading her other work."
57,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11701608-barbara,Rating 5 out of 5,"Full confession: I love Ann Patchett’s writing. I KNOW I’m getting a solid novel that will cut into me, make me think, build compassion, see understanding. In her new novel “The Dutch House” she explores, again, children who are left without parental interest and supervision. As with “Commonwealth”, she also explores blended families and the bonds of stepsiblings. Beyond her themes, her writing is beautiful, lyrical, easy, like floating on an inter-tube on a lazy sunny day.Can you come to peace with what happened to you in childhood is a major theme? Danny is three when his mother leaves him and his sister Maeve, who is ten at the time. They live in a house that they call “The Dutch House” which is this big striking mansion that is ornate and ostentatious. Danny’s father bought it as a gift for Danny’s mother without her knowing. His parents were poor Irish immigrants and unbeknownst to his mother, his father, Cyril makes money in real estate without ever consulting or explaining their change in status to Elna, Danny’s mother. The family moves into the Dutch House when Maeve is five. The house even comes with a housekeeper, it’s too much for Elna who loves being poor.To add complexity, Cyril is an absent father and the children are basically raised by house staff. Along come an evil woman who has designs on the house and Cyril. Of course, Cyril marries her, and she brings in two girls. As with Patchett’s other stories, the children blend well. It’s the evil stepmother who adds tragedy when Cyril unexpectedly dies, and she bans Maeve and Danny from the house. Not only that, but she leaves the two penniless except for an educational trust left for Danny. By then Maeve is through college and Danny is a high schooler.Danny feels anger at his mother for abandoning them. Maeve feels longing. Their grit and determination get them through life. The story is told through Danny’s eyes and the story is non-linear, much like our thoughts.This would be a fabulous book club read. All the characters in the novel are fodder for discussion. Patchett shows how humans find their way, find their strengths and bonds. She shows through her characters how some can find forgiveness, some compassion, and always gratitude. "
58,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,Rating 5 out of 5,"An Ann Patchett novel is a treasure. She writes about family so compellingly that I always feel as if I know her characters in real life, and I'm drawn into the stories she shares about their inner lives.If you're already a Patchett fan, you've probably heard about how she describes her novels: ""I've been writing the same book my whole life -- that you're in one family, and all of a sudden, you're in another family and it's not your choice and you can't get out.""The Dutch House is a novel about family, but this time the focus is on two siblings, Maeve and Danny. Maeve is our heroine, but her younger brother Danny is our narrator. We see how their lives get upended when their mother runs away and their father picks a wicked stepmother as his second wife.I listened to this book on audio, performed by Tom Hanks, who was a marvelous storyteller. I usually read an Ann Patchett novel several times, and I'm already looking forward to re-reading this one and discovering anew all of her clever descriptions. Highly recommended for readers who like literary fiction.Favorite PassageFor the most part, what I knew about my father was what I saw: he was tall and thin with weathered skin and hair the color of rust, the color of my hair. All three of us had blue eyes. His left knee was slow to bend, worse in the winter and when it rained. He never said a word about it but it was easy enough to tell when it hurt him. He smoked Pall Malls, put milk in his coffee, worked the crossword puzzle before reading the front page. He loved buildings the way boys loved dogs. When I was eight years old, I asked my father at the dinner table if he was going to vote for Eisenhower or Stevenson. Eisenhower was running for a second term and all the boys in school were for him. My father clicked the point of his knife against his plate and told me I was never to ask a question like that, not of him, not of anyone. ""It may be fine for boys to speculate on whom they might vote for because boys can't vote,"" he said. ""But to ask an adult such a question is to violate a man's right to privacy."" In retrospect, I imagine my father was horrified that I might think there was any chance he'd vote for Stevenson, but I didn't know that at the time. What I knew was that you had to touch a hot stove only once. Here are the things I talked to my father about when I was a boy: baseball -- he liked the Phillies. Trees -- he knew the name of every one, though he would chastise me for asking about the same kind of tree more than once. Birds -- likewise. He kept feeders in the backyard and could easily identify all of his customers. Buildings -- be it their structural soundness, architectural details, property value, property tax, you name it -- my father liked to talk about buildings. To list the things I didn't ask my father about would be to list the stars in heaven, so let me throw out one: I did not ask my father about women. Not women in general and what you were supposed to do with them, and definitely not women in the particular: my mother, my sister, Andrea."

Do you ever get tired of reminiscing?”For those who’ve read Ann Patchett before, The Dutch House probably needs no introduction. It’s Ann Patchett. It’s a family saga. That’s all you need.For those (like me) who haven’t, it’s a little harder to explain the book’s appeal. It spans decades, following a brother and sister, Danny & Maeve Conroy. They live in a fancy house, then they don’t. The house is THE most remarkable thing about them. It haunts their lives.But it’s the way Patchett tells it that makes it special, the layers, the tapestry of details. We learn about the VanHoebeeks, who owned the Dutch House before the Conroys. When the VanHoebeek family line ended, the house was sold with all its contents, right down to the jewels, and two eerie life-sized paintings of the former occupants. It’s the depth of characterisations, where no one is wholly good or bad, the humanity contained in their flaws and foibles. It’s the fairytale allusions, the way Patchett replaces gingerbread and candy with floor-to-ceiling glass and blue delft mantels, and loses none of the magic and awe.This is a sparkling world of privilege, even after the house is lost, but Patchett avoids writing a ‘rich people problems’ book in two ways:1)	The problems faced are universal. A sudden death or betrayal or abandonment; an unexpected reversal of fortunes; long-simmering resentments and paths to forgiveness. Nothing money could solve. 2)	Chance is a major factor, as much in raising fortunes as losing them. Or call it luck, or fate, these lives are sailing on its winds.It’s an utterly charming, moving, absorbing novel, only slightly let down by some draggy bits and the fact that I deeply, deeply disliked the ending. But I’m definitely a Patchett fan now. 4 stars."

Can hardly think of the last time a historical fiction novel including so many mundanities of everyday life entranced me so fully. And this isn't a story I've read before. In one sense it carves out a place in the annals of true Americana, exploring the dichotomy of greed and abnegation across generations. In another it's a sweet, small family drama exploring the bond between two siblings. Patchett paints characters that are as full and recognizable as the inimitable Anne Tyler's, if not necessarily as charming, for better or worse. I have a very short list of must-read-every-new-book authors, and after my first Patchett, she has tentatively made the list.Posted in Mr. Philip's Library"

62,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37596075-holly,Rating 5 out of 5,"Ann Patchett is a master storyteller and she lives up to this reputation with her latest work - The Dutch House. Her writing is superb and the stories she tells invite you in and before you know it, you’ve developed deep relationships with the characters. This is a story about abandonment, love, family, loyalty, loss, and forgiveness. It is also about growing up and letting go of the past.There are three main characters - Danny, the narrator and younger brother of Maeve, our second character and the House. The Dutch House was first built by the VanHoebeeks, who decorated it in Dutch style and lived there until they died. In fact, all of their possessions had remained there after they had left this world. Life-sized portraits of Mr. and Mrs. VanHoebeeks adorned the walls of the drawing room and paintings of other relatives hung on walls throughout the house. It was a grand estate with glass in the front that saw all the way through to the flowers in the back. Patchett skillfully gives the House life with vivid imagery and detailed descriptions that you will almost feel like you are there.The VanHoebeeks weren’t the story, but in a sense the house was the story, and it was their house.The Dutch House, as it came to be known in Elkins Park and Jenkintown and Glenside and all the way to Philadelphia, referred not to the house’s architecture but to its inhabitants. The Dutch House was the place where those Dutch people with the unpronounceable name lived.When they were young, Danny and Maeve’s mother abandoned them and Maeve stepped into that role. Danny expressed concern that no one could do the same for Maeve. The two siblings grew incredibly close and stayed that way throughout their lives. Their relationship was very touching and a very appealing aspect of the story. Several years after their Mother left, their Father married Andrea, who was the epitome of the evil stepmother. Their dislike of her further united them, if that was even possible.We ate the cookies and dredged up every awful memory of Andrea we had. We traded them between us like baseball cards, exclaiming over every piece of information one of us didn’t already know. We dug a pit and roasted her.The Dutch House figures prominently in the story. It drove Maeve’s and Danny’s Mother away — it symbolized to her luxurious excess in a world where others went starving. For their Father, it represented success. The house is what ultimately brought Andrea into their family — she married their Father in order to get it.For Danny and Maeve, the house was a place to grow up as well as to return. It represented their memories and their pasts. A dominant theme in The Dutch House is the siblings’ inability to let go of the past and their emotional baggage of anger as well as regret. The house physically drew them back time and time again, like a magnet. Whenever Danny returned to town, he and Maeve would end up parked across the street from the Dutch House, watching for any activity or news. There was no extra time in those days and I didn’t want to spend the little of it I had sitting in front of the goddamn house, but that’s where we wound up......like swallows, like salmon, we were the helpless captives of our migratory patterns.Looking and watching the house, they would reminisce about the past and wonder if one can ever truly contemplate the past objectively.But we overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.I didn’t even know they were sisters, meaning I was a toad. But that’s me layering the present onto the past.Ann Patchett weaves together emotional stories, which capture your heart. She is a fabulous writer: here are a few examples of her masterful use of imagery and metaphors/similes.Whatever romantic notions I might have harbored, whatever excuses or allowances my heart had ever made on her behalf, blew out like a match.There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you’d been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet in place, and for a moment you’re suspended, knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself.That was it. Fluffy, who had not stopped talking since I walked in the door, shut down like a mechanical horse in need of another nickel."
63,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2967061-anne,Rating 2 out of 5,"I always look forward to a new Ann Patchett novel, having enjoyed all the ones I've read so far. I listened to this one on audio, narrated wonderfully by Tom Hanks. While listening and enjoying the narration I kept wondering where this story was going. I also had questions about choices made and agreed upon by the main characters and about the stereotypical evil step mother, but knew that I was in the hands of a great storyteller and trusted that Patchett was just taking her time setting up the story for a terrific denouement . But by Part 3, which took up the last 2/3rds of the novel, I saw that I was mistaken. This part didn't explain what I needed explained (can't say more without spoilers) which was really frustrating, and took the story in a direction that I couldn't buy. It just didn't make any emotional or psychological sense and was very underwhelming as an ending. In fact, I was taken by surprise when the book ended. I was still looking for something more, something deeper, more meaningful. I kept feeling ""What? That's it? "" There had to be a more satisfying conclusion to everything that happened in the first 2/3rds of the novel. But there wasn't. I felt the need of a book group to discuss this novel and to vent my frustrations. While listening to the book I thought that this was going to be a 3 star read for me (or 4 stars if Patchett pulled the story together in a satisfying way). Given the ending, it was a 2 star read with 1 star added for the Tom Hanks narration. I see from most of the current GR reviews that I'm in the minority on this one. That makes me pause to wonder why I had such a different experience. Again, I feel the need for that book group.On a different note, I greatly enjoyed the several references to the Hungarian Pastry Shop near Columbia University in NYC. I went there often when I was a student and worked and lived in that area. That brought back memories."

Many parts of it lived up to my expectations, but there were too many pages that seemed to drag along without advancing either the story line or the character development. I also found it difficult to stay emotionally involved with characters whose decisions keep making their situation worse for themselves with no good reason or perceived benefit. Finally, the ending seemed tacked on rather than flowing from the story. The writing, as always with Ann Patchett, was often beautiful and occasionally stunning."
65,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23381142-natalie,Rating 4 out of 5,"If you needed any convincing to read this book, take this next passage as your sign:(it’s a bit long but so worth the read)“Mothers were the measure of safety, which meant that I was safer than Maeve. After our mother left, Maeve took up the job on my behalf but no one did the same for her. Of course Sandy and Jocelyn mothered us. They made sure we were washed and fed and that our lunches were packed and our scouting dues paid. They loved us, I know they did, but they went home at the end of the day. There was no crawling into bed with Sandy or Jocelyn when I had a bad dream in the middle of the night, and it never once occurred to me to knock on my father’s door. I went to Maeve. She taught me the proper way to hold a fork. She attended my basketball games and knew all my friends and oversaw my homework and kissed me every morning before we went our separate ways to school and again at night before I went to bed regardless of whether or not I wanted to be kissed. She told me repeatedly, relentlessly, that I was kind and smart and fast, that I could be as great a man as I made up my mind to be. She was so good at all that, despite the fact that no one had done it for her.”This rings so true.The feelings evoked in me while reading The Dutch House were reminiscent of my reading experience with books like The Great Alone, Little Fires Everywhere, and A Spool of Blue Thread (both even have the similar ""Oh, Danny""). That is to say, what a journey awaits me. Maeve will be someone to behold.“Five whole days with you at home,” she said, blowing smoke out the open window. “The best five days of the year.”On another note, it showcases the author’s talents that within one page I can hate a character and yet know nothing substantial about them. Ahem, Andrea. You can just tell, like with real people, who spells trouble. Translating that feeling on paper? That’s a magical writer right there.But back to reasons why I love Maeve: “Maeve was pretty enough and popular enough that she would never have had to stay home on Saturday nights, but for the most part she did, and for the first time I realized it was because of me. She would never have left me alone in the house.”Big sisters. That's it. “and the way the last bit of light fell over her, she looked like a painting.”She looked like a … painting!! She has long black hair! The painting of the girl on the cover is MAEVE. I knew it held something more about it. 

I couldn’t stop staring at the cover when I first got my hands on the book. And so I kept feeling drawn like a magnet to it until I finally caved in and picked the book up. Like, it wouldn’t leave my head until I had it in my hands. This book was calling to me. Or rather, Maeve was calling to me. I'm intrigued now.“Now that she wasn’t around to help me with my homework, I wondered for the first time who had ever helped her when she was young.”I never realized just how much my soul needed to read a book about appreciating older sisters as stand-in mothers until I stumbled upon The Dutch House. This is healing. It’s the little things no one notices when it comes to taking care of younger siblings, like helping them out with their homework, or those simple moments that arise to remind them of how good they are so those values are instilled from a young age.“You only think you want to get rid of your sister,” Jocelyn said, clapping her hand on my shoulder in a firm manner so as not to embarrass me. “Then when she’s gone it turns out you miss her.”I wonder if this feeling has a name. It evokes the most acute emotion.Not only does this book represent the part of an older sister fully committed to her younger sibling, it's the loss of a childhood home that cannot go unnoticed. It reverberates throughout your life. The hurt these next passages encompass cannot be overstated:“The idiocy of what we took and what we left cannot be overstated. We packed up clothes and shoes I would outgrow in six months, and left behind the blanket at the foot of my bed my mother had pieced together out of her dresses.”“and there were some other things—yearbooks, a couple boxes of novels she’d already read, some dolls she was saving for the daughter she was sure she would have one day, all in the attic under the eaves and behind the tiny door in the back of the third-floor bedroom closet. Did Andrea even know about that space? Maeve had shown it to the girls the night of the house tour, but would they remember or ever think to look in there again? Or would those boxes just belong to the house now, sealed into the wall like a time capsule from her youth?”You'll forever think about the things you didn't think to take. “I always imagined the house would die without us. I don’t know, I thought it would crumple up. Do houses ever die of grief?” The longwinded realization that at the end of the day a house is just that, a house, came to me after years and years. The house stays the same for the most part. You’re the one who changes through the years.What a powerful story. Like I said earlier, The Dutch House reminds me distinctly of The Great Alone. It's that sense of togetherness and loyalty you feel as the reader to these book characters. Maeve was the star of this book for me. The quiet star that shines the brightest but is set aside too often. She never got quite what she deserved. She worked the hardest of them all and was never fully redeemed, especially with a character like Celeste to remind her of that. And who is Celeste to say those things? Her name says all you need to know about her character.Celeste wasn’t listening. Where Maeve was concerned she didn’t listen. “At what point do you say to her, Okay, it was an awful childhood, it’s a terrible thing to be rich and then not be rich, but now everybody has to grow up?”People like her are why people like Andrea exist.Celeste never fully understands the sacrifice Maeve had to make to ensure Danny’s well being. Celeste never thinks about why Maeve took on that job she thinks is beneath her (to stay closer to Danny) or why she lives where she does (to stay closer to Danny). Maeve served everyone but herself, and it upsets me to think someone so privileged - so entitled to their privilege they aren't even aware of it- has the audacity to judge Maeve. It reminded me of this brilliant line in the poem, ""To this day"": When a kid who could still go home to mom and dadHad the audacity to tell him “get over it”Though my hatred wasn't Andrea-level, it felt pretty close. This passage hits it right on:“Those are my two choices? I love her or I hate her?”“Well,” my sister said, “you’re telling me you didn’t hate her, so I just want to know what the parameters are. I think it’s a ridiculous conversation to be having in the first place, if you want my opinion. Say there’s a kid who lives next door, a kid you have no particular friendship with but no problems with either. Then one day he walks into your house and kills your sister with a baseball bat.”“Maeve, for the love of God.”She held up her hand. “Hear me out. Does that present fact obliterate the past? Maybe not if you loved the kid. Maybe if you loved the kid you’d dig in and try to find out what had happened, see things from his perspective, wonder what his parents had done to him, wonder if there wasn’t some chemical imbalance. You might even consider that your sister could have played a role in the outcome—did she torment this boy? Was she cruel to him? But you’d only wonder about that if you loved him. If you only liked the kid, if he was never anything more to you than an okay neighbor, I don’t see the point in scratching around for good memories. He’s gone to prison. You’re never going to see the son-of-a-bitch again.”I love her.If anything, Danny’s lackluster relationship and medical education were worth for this one scene:“Do my spine,” she said.She hadn’t taken her shower yet and she still smelled like the ocean, like the wind coming over Brighton Beach. I reached my fingers beneath her hair and felt the base of her skull. “Atlas, axis, first cervical vertebra.” I pressed each one like a piano key, touch and then release, counting all seven. “Thoracic. You’ve got to do a better job with the sunscreen.”“Hush. Don’t ruin it.”“Thoracic.” I counted out the twelve, and then I got to the lumbar. I rubbed deep circles in her lower back until she made soft, cowlike sounds.”I'm so attached to Maeve that seeing her receive the bare minimum was beyond painful to read. Give her a break! Not only did Maeve have to deal with someone like Andrea in her youth, on top of taking care of her younger sibling, she now receives someone like Celeste in her adulthood to battle with. Needless to say she did not receive the ending I thought she deserved. This book is depressing, too much like reality. I'm already hurt in real life. Give me at least some semblance of a happy ending for characters that deserve it the most in books. This, too, reminds me of my experience with The Great Alone.Join me and read the opening chapter for yourself. You’ll be hooked.

I missed a few of hers pre-Bel Canto and while I haven't yet gotten to them, it comforts me to know that they're waiting for me for when life slows down (I've heard that happens; one day you wake up and you're older and retired and you can read all the time). When I heard The Dutch House was coming out and saw its distinctive cover (Who IS that girl? I wondered) I put it on my TBDWIR (To Be Devoured When It Releases) list pronto.And then it released and people were talking about it, and it was popping up on bestsellers lists all over the place and audio book lovers were swooning over this tale being read to them by the venerable Tom Hanks. I hurried through the other required reading I was working on, and made space in my life to enjoy The Dutch House. I had already bought it, it was just there on my cluttered nightstand awaiting me.I hadn't read much about the novel, which is my usual thing. I don't read the back copy of books I know I am going to want to read. Sometimes there are mini spoilers there. So I didn't know what The Dutch House was or who lived in it or what it meant to them. I didn't know what the evocative painting on the front meant and I certainly couldn't know how I would be affected when Patchett revealed the significance of that painting, and this at a time in the story when I had already fallen in love with these perfectly drawn characters. It was the kind of book that I couldn't wait to get back to, not because I just had to know what happened next, but because I just had to know what happened to these characters next.  Here is just one of the beautifully composed thoughts penned in its pages.“There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you'd been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet in place, and for a moment you're suspended knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself.”I was going to use the back cover copy to tell you what the book is about but I'm not going to. I will just say it's a book about a brother and sister, and their childhood home, and everything that the word ""home"" might and should conjure up in your mind when you hear that word spoken.  I loved it so much I am going to use one of my Audible credits and have Tom Hanks read it to me. I hardly ever read books twice because, you know, so many books, so little time. So you know it's a good one when I tell you I'll be ""reading"" this one again. Soon.Highly recommend."

I'm not sure why, but I was worried that I might find it harder to connect with a new story in audio form. Luckily it only took me a few chapters to adjust, aided by my returning the reading speed to normal, as Tom Hanks reads much faster than Stephen Fry.I loved listening to this and got completely caught up in it. I found the characters fixation on The Dutch House more relatable than I had expected. Maeve was a wonderful, occasionally frustrating character. Her brother was less dynamic and I'm actually not sure I would have liked him that much but his love for his sister, his appreciation of her and his dedication to her did endear him to me.I found the situation of them losing their father and being banished from the house by their stepmother understandably difficult, and sympathised to a point with Maeve's desire to bleed the education trust dry. It was amusing at times and part of me got the point, but it also felt so self-indulgent, petty, wasteful. They were put in a tough spot, her more than him, but why not use that free education to build toward something rather than just prove a point? If they were real people I would have little time for them I think, but as characters they were fascinating.I might like to read this one again one day as there was something quite beautiful about it. It was a gripping story, and I enjoyed it, even when I was feeling deeply frustrated with the two siblings and the decisions they made.I love the cover, its what made me want to read the book. I don't always appreciate a fictional book having such a specific image of the main character as I prefer to imagine them for myself, but this one is so perfect that I don't mind. It's another reason why I want a physical copy, so I can see the image in full, and take it off the shelf to look at whenever I want to."

I liked the way they changed - and how their perception of the House shifted as they grew and aged. Patchett weaves a complex narrative that doesn't fit together perfectly, just like life.

It felt dark and depressing through most of the book and described such a sad family life for two children to live through, I felt like I had a dark cloud over my head every time I sat down to read it.With so many readers touting how great it was, I felt a bit bewildered as to why I didn't feel the love here...!? What was I missing? I did like the way the book ended and was glad for that but to have to travel the entire book to get to this one favorable destination I liked? Hmmm...? I'm told the Audiobook is much better so I plan to listen to that version sometime in my next lifetime. Perhaps Tom Hank's voice will have an influence on my rating.

But, no matter how far they travel, or how many years pass, Maeve and Danny just can’t let go of The Dutch House.An epic generational saga of family dysfunction, neglect, abandonment, stolen inheritance, and a troubled relationship between siblings. Maeve and Danny’s impenetrable unbreakable bond was warm, supportive, and loving in some respects, and I was sympathetic to their plight. However, it was also unhealthy and destructive, capable of sabotaging and undermining any other relationship they had, or formed, and tended to be controlling, co-dependent, and demanding. Furthermore, their inability to come to terms with their past invaded every facet of their lives and affected every decision. The story was influenced by both fairy tale and folklore. There were references or similarities to Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, Hansel and Gretel, Snow White, and the Nutcracker ballet, among others. The Dutch House – named after the nationality of its original owner’s the VanHoebeeks (whose portraits were on prominent display above the fireplace) – was a character in itself and took on a eerie, ever-present life of its own. The three-storey mansion, built in the 1920’s, was grand, imposing, sprawling, and contained a cellar, attic, multiple bedrooms, and even a ballroom, and let’s face it, you can’t get more fairy tale than that? Danny always referred to it by its title, never just house or home.Our sole POV was a middle-aged Danny (first person) reflecting back on his childhood and early adult years and how they shaped the man he became in his late forties/early fifties. The story opened in 1956 when Danny was eight (Maeve fifteen) with the arrival of Andrea into their lives, stepping across the threshold of The Dutch House for the first time. Events encompass the next fifty years, somewhat chronologically, but also contained flashbacks and flash forwards smack bang in the middle of any given chapter. Meaning, there were one or two occasions where I had to remind myself what stage of life Danny was narrating from. But, Ann Patchett, did include little reminders which got me back on track, so all good. The book art, the painting of 12-year-old Maeve in her Red Riding Hood coat is probably my favourite cover of all time. I just can’t stop staring at it! Mesmerising!The Dutch House was a sensational novel that entertained, informed and amused. Deserves pride of place on your bookshelf."
71,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3642045-sue,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Dutch House is the story of a family, and a very distinguished house, and the ways in which that combination played on everyone’s lives and relationships. It is also a story of the ways in which a person’s life can be altered, hemmed in, defined, expanded, most definitely changed, for good or ill, by significant others and even a place. Also a story of fighting, or not fighting, those influences to live one’s own life.And a wonderful story it is. Ann Patchett is an excellent writer, able to capture her characters and settings so well. Some we learn about quickly; others develop or evolve more slowly. The Dutch House is itself a character in this novel as its presence is a factor in much of the major activity throughout. It is an old mansion purchased by Mr Conroy as surprise for his wife who had no idea he had somehow become rich.In the beginning, there were Maeve and Danny Conroy, children of Cyril and Elna Conroy. Elna has been gone from their lives since Danny was a toddler, leaving him with no memory of her. Maeve, being older, has fond, loving memories. Family rumor is Elna apparently left for India years before. Father seems a somewhat standoff type man, showing occasional moments of warm emotion. True warmth comes from support staff needed to care for the house and children, Sandy and Jocelyn, who provide motherly care. Danny narrates the novel.Beyond that well...then it is how life develops. I do not want to walk you through the ups and downs and sometimes odd decisions made during the years as Danny and Maeve mature and make life choices. That’s for you to read. And I do recommend you read this book. It’s a primer on the directions and misdirections life can take as people try to deal with the remnants of their childhood. It’s also a very vivid portrayal of the relationship of a brother and sister from the teen years into adulthood, as their lives change.4.5* - 5* A copy of this book was provided by the publisher through NetGalley in return for an honest review."

In a twist on the evil stepmother story, we follow the lives of brother and sister Danny and Maeve through their life journeys as seen through Danny's eyes. Each character is fully-fleshed out and the writing is neither too ornate nor too flat. The story is interesting and not over-bearing. I really liked the flow of the text and the use of the Dutch House as a motif throughout the book. The book is written in a retrospective manner which also leads to some introspection as well:But we overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered. (loc. 635)Reflections on being a son:He had protected me from the world so completely that I had no idea what the world was capable of. I had never thought about him as a child. I had never asked him about the war. I had only seen him as my father, and as my father I had judged him. There was nothing to do about that now but add it to the catalog of my mistakes.(loc. 1384)Reflections on life's long journey and out choices - a theme in this book regarding Danny's choices between what he wants and what is expected from him:There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you’d been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet in place, and for a moment you’re suspended, knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself. (loc. 1702)I like this metaphor:We had stepped into the river that takes you forward. (loc. 2640)And this analogy:When she walked away, she turned back to look at me so many times she appeared to be going up the sidewalk in a loose series of concentric circles. (loc. 2793)Danny discovers his mother late in life, but is unsure how to tell Maeve about her:After years of living in response to the past, we had somehow become miraculously unstuck, moving forward in time just like everyone else. To tell Maeve our mother was out there, to tell her I wasn’t sure if our parents had ever divorced, meant reigniting the fire I’d spent my life stamping out. (loc. 2874)A nice reflection on bringing up kids in the city and getting them used to empty spaces of time:In the city of constant stimulation, we had failed to give them the opportunity to develop strong inner lives for those occasions when they would find themselves sitting through the second act of The Nutcracker. (loc 3372)A very typical dream of many fathers, myself included>When Maeve knocked on my door, she woke me from a dream in which I was trying to swim to Kevin. Every stroke I took towards him seemed to push him farther out, until I was struggling to see his head above the water’s chop. I kept calling for him to swim back but he was too far away to hear me. I sat straight up, gasping, trying to make sense of where I was. Then I remembered. I had never been so happy to be awake. (loc. 3473)When she does appear near the end of Maeve's life, Danny sees his mother initially as an agent of death:but she was there now, at Abington Memorial Hospital, like the Angel of Death. I said nothing to her because one should never initiate a conversation with Death.

73,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7862560-la-canter,Rating 5 out of 5,"Ann Patchett is the man! And of course, I mean that in more ways than this flippant complimentary term carries. That Tom Hanks, of all people, was the one to narrate this audiobook might just be a testament to how great it is.My first confession, though, is that she is probably my favorite writer ever. I own and have read every novel she's penned, not because of the high drama (although there is always some of that) or the quirky family situations (a ubiquitous inclusion) and the thread of lies (again, a constant) in all of them. Patchett has a quiet grace and slicing analysis that are rarely found in the writings of one author. She has never failed to surprise me, so each time one of her novels comes up for sale, I join the purchase queue in total faith.With that mea culpa out of the way, Patchett is one of the few writers I've read who speaks believably from the point of view of a protagonist who is of the opposite gender. The author and poet Ron Rash can pull this off well. The ""grit lit"" writer Daniel Woodrell and the unique Donna Tartt are also masters. But for this reader. those folks form a small, extremely talented club. They make gender almost seem immaterial - we see the person inside - but at the same time, the little clichés about men not being overly verbal about their emotions and that women are vociferously protective of family are still there. So, yeah. Patchett - in this case - is the man, fully and entirely.You've read the blurb, probably, and know that the story revolves around a pair of adult siblings with a dysfunctional childhood. Their longest stretch of stability was spent with their parents in an enormous and gorgeous old home, and over later decades, the two occasionally park across the street from the grounds and think about the days that were and the people that were.I don't want to spill any more than that because Patchett's stories are best left with little surprises for the reader. For those who are already fans of her work, you'll again bump into the idea that some people are considered to be ""saints"" even though one of the characters nails them as garden variety narcissists. You will find people that love one another like family but who have no biological ties. There is forgiveness in here. And long held grudges. Laughter and love and pain.Lastly, if you've ever had a parent abandon you in some way or share a devoted relationship with a brother or sister, this is going to resonate. Patchett grew up in a blended family, so her wisdom and insights have been a lifetime in formation. And every time her novels close, it feels like they do so with a benediction for us all.Five stars. Favorites shelf."

It's familial. The best way I can express it is to say that if The Dutch House and my first novel (Plan Z by Leslie Kove) and my mother's first novel (The Trouble with the Truth) were sisters, The Dutch House would be our middle sibling. This book makes me miss my long-dead mother because I feel as if she should know about it. And I should be able to talk with her about the fact that I read it just after learning that the new new-owners demolished the house my mother built, which always seemed to me like a live being with roots deep in my psyche, even long after we gave it up in 1968. Even though I and my siblings had terrible memories of our life there, during the 48 years that the people we sold it to lived there, we each individually made pilgrimages to visit or just look at the house. And it just seems unfair that now my mother and I cannot mourn the demise of her creation while reading and admiring The Dutch House—while as writers, we marvel at everything from the gorgeous cover art by painter Noah Saterstrom (what a daring artist) to the story about a family and a house, which is so reminiscent yet completely different from both of our work that I have a very hard time believing we are not all related. I wish we were. "

I'm too tired and brain dead to write anything after being on the road yesterday with the family and grand-kids then spending the day at Monterey Bay Aquarium with what seemed like thousands of people with the same idea.I'll just say the pleasure of reading this was like biting into one of those perfectly ripe and sweet Harry and David Royal Rivera pears and my lips and fingers are still sticky with the juice that dripped everywhere.
76,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18643650-mark-porton,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Dutch House by Anne Patchett is a fabulous book.The story is told through the eyes of Danny Conroy. He takes us on an incredible journey involving his parents, his sister, various housekeepers, step-mother, step-sisters, children and many, many others. The story starts not long after the end of WW2, and revolves around an old mansion, previously built and owned by the VanHoebeek family.There’s no need to tell you much about the story other than it’s a complex, layered and believable family saga covering 3 generations. This is my first book by this author (yes, where have I been?) and she just doesn’t miss a beat. Patchett paints such a rich picture, using just the right amount of words, placed exactly where they should be - I felt I was actually there. Even her descriptions of personal features, expressions and body posture, movement – were so accurate I felt like they were better than actually seeing the people myself. This one had me hooked from the beginning, and I was so sad it finished. In fact, I finished it only 30 minutes ago and feel quite emotional about the whole bloody thing. Why did it have to stop now? How can a book just jump into our life, take us on an incredible journey and then leave us, just like that? This was one of those books. I can compare it to my feelings of attachment to the Joad Family in Grapes of Wrath, I still wonder what they’re up to. I cared that much about them. Well it is the same here.Such precise passages like:“We overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it is the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.”For those of us who spend much of our time looking over our shoulder, this is really a passage to make us stop and think. Yes, memories, regrets, the past, feature heavily in this book.Also this little gem:��Thinking about the past impeded my efforts to be decent in the present”How good is that?This book will make you gasp, laugh and cry. For anyone who has been a father, mother, brother, sister…..or let’s just say a ‘human’. There will be something in this book that will resonate with you. This was my first audiobook and Tom Hanks’ narration was first class. Sorry this is such a gushy review but it is what it is.5 Wonderful Stars"

Warning lovers of this book - I'm about to get unapologetically vicious. Remember, this is all my opinion, even if I structure sentences so that they read as factual. I would never have read this book were it not my next book club read. I should have known from the blurb that there would be nothing good about this book. It consisted of merely seven lines of text in what I can only assume is size 20 font. I haven't seen such a blurb since I was five and read picture books. What a vapid and empty book. I'm baffled by the popularity of it. It was as insightful and enlightening as watching reality television for five hours. There's no purpose (let alone poetry) behind anything that happens in this book. The characters are as basic as those in a creative writing class for eight-year-olds, as is the novel's drive. The Dutch house is special. Why it's special, we don't know. Their mother hated it so much that she abandoned her family to leave it. What was so horrible about it, we don't know. People hate other people. Why they hate other people, we don't know. We're supposed to care about the main characters. Why we should care about the main characters, we don't know. Everyone wants to be part of this damn house. Why they want to be, we don't know.There's nothing emotionally tangible about this book. There's no atmosphere, no connection, voices or emotion. People marry just for the sake of having a marriage and baby as part of the plot - why they married who they married, we don't know. We don't get to know anyone. Their voices are entirely uniform, and there are no identifying markers, real backstory or essence or soul. Why does everyone either love or hate this house? Why should I care? Everything was just so primitive. It was like Pratchett just knew the fundamentals of writing that everyone is taught at school and wrote them out in the most vacuous way. People get sad when there's a death, so let's have some death. People like marriage and babies, so let's have some of that too. People like everything to end up happily ever after even if it's not realistic, so let's make that happen. There was so little artistic prowess in this novel that I wouldn't have been surprised if she ended the book with ""and Danny woke up, and it was all a dream'. It was THAT level of sophistication. "

Η μητέρα τους είχε φύγει όταν ήταν ακόμα μικρά και λίγα χρόνια αργότερα ο πατέρας τους παντρεύτηκε μια νεαρή και όμορφη γυναίκα. Η κακιά μητριά έκανε δύσκολη τη ζωή των παιδιών και όταν ο πατέρας τους πέθανε, τα έδιωξε από το σπίτι.

79,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41788446-hannah,Rating 1 out of 5,"I knew fairly early into this book that I was not the right reader for it. That I finished it has more to do with the format in which I consumed it (the audiobook is narrated by Tom Hanks) than with any hope I had that it would get better. To be fair, there were parts in the middle that worked better for me - but overall, this is just not my type of book at all. It has been described as a modern fairy tale and that is true only in the worst sense: the story is neither magical nor lyrical but the characters are all as flat as the characters in Grimm's fairy tales - they are Patchett's puppet's moving the story along, not always in ways which made sense to me.To illustrate why I am not the right reader, here a few things I dislike in books, in no particular order: family sagas (check), historical fiction (check), evil step parents (check), flat characters (check), undeveloped female characters (check), incredibly detailed narration (check), people being treated unfairly (check), women hating women for no good reason (check), horrible parents (check and check). The structure could have worked for me as it jumps back and forth in time, which is something I often enjoy, but the storyline mostly just bored me. The rambling nature of the narrative worked best for me when there were the smallest emotional stakes: when Danny talks about his education or his real estate dabbling. Whenever the stakes were higher, I became increasingly frustrated. Part of that has to do with Danny being an omnipotent narrator while still being only in his own head, part has to do with how one-note these characters all were. For other people, this book has worked brilliantly (and I can kind of see why if I squint and look at this sideways), for me this was a frustrating slog following a character I found boring and self-involved.Content warning: Death of a loved one, heart attack, abandonement, Alzheimer's DiseaseYou can find this review and other thoughts on books on my blog."
80,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie-g,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Dutch House is a story about three generations of a family whose relationships are closely connected to a house outside Philadelphia. Cyril Conroy, a real estate developer who made his money renovating old buildings, bought the Dutch House as a surprise for his wife. Cyril loved old buildings, probably more than people, and was proud of his acquisition. His wife, who felt that she had a mission to help poor people, never felt comfortable in a home that looked like a museum and had a ballroom on the third floor. Their children, Maeve and Danny, were left motherless for reasons we find out later in the book. Maeve takes on the role of protector of her little brother, and changes her whole life to care for him.Cyril later meets the manipulative Andrea who covets the Dutch House, and they are soon married. Andrea's interest lies with the house, and not with her stepchildren. The Dutch House is an important part of both the sense of loss and the strong bond shared by Danny and his sister.Narrated by Danny, the story tells about childhood trauma and family relationships. It goes forward and backward in time, slowly showing us the events that molded Danny and Maeve into the people they would become. The close relationships between the siblings was special, and they could always count on each other. Ann Patchett's writing is captivating and humorous. I expect The Dutch House to be an especially good story for book discussion groups. 4.5 stars."

The summary, the characters, the problems, the overcoming of problems were never even relevant or seen shown important. Everything was about the house. THE GODDAMN HOUSE. It was like Jumanji had captured the characters and tossed them aside and had in some twisted way, given the house the voice of the narrator and life. GODDD!One of my biggest mistakes to ever pick this novel up!I'm really not kidding.I may be a part of the minority but god's sake, I wanted everything else, really I did.The characters -so bloody one dimensional. And it's mostly the sister Maeve who the brother centers his world around. Sigh..The problems are way too childish for me to care about and everyone's just moved on, like it's nothing. So really. I could care less about this novel and its existence.Case fucking closed. Until the next read,-J.B"
82,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76203549-nika,Rating 2 out of 5,"Having just started this book, I expected to enjoy it but it turned out to be a huge disappointment for me.If the first chapter kept me somewhat interested, starting from the second chapter I felt disconnected from what was happening in the novel.The characters and plot left me completely indifferent. The main idea around which centers the plotline did not speak to me. At the core of the story is the Dutch House, a monumental and cold building. It can seem a forbidding place, but, despite its aloofness or perhaps due to it, the House holds a hardly explicable power over those who inhabit it. The Conroy family bought the house from the impoverished Dutch negociants. Now they expect to live happily in their new home but strange things start to happen... I would be happy to say that they did but in fact nothing special happens. This uneventfulness is typical of the novel.Mrs. Conroy - the mother of two children - develops a strange relationship with the house. It looms so large and terrifying in her imagination that she leaves her children and husband to move to India. We are to believe that Mrs. Conroy can no longer cope with the Dutch House. Well, in my opinion, this explanation does not look credible unless certain details are given.The woman's decision triggers a series of painful events. Soon, another woman appears on the scene and in the Dutch House. Maeve and Danny Conroy - the children of the Conroys - will be the most affected. Their relationship with the house is that of 'love-hate.'The house is probably a metaphor for the problematic past that could be so difficult to overcome.It may also be interpreted as a symbol of childhood traumas that pervade the present and impact the future. This explanation, however, applies to the sister and brother who have been raised in the Dutch House. I can understand this idea but it is difficult for me to connect with it. According to Ann Patchett, the house is ""just symbolic of the life."" Sounds fine but the narration did not convince me. For me, the Dutch House, formidable as it may look, is only a building made of bricks. There are things much more important than that, such as human relationships, compassion, or hobbies. However, the symbolic meaning of the house hardly explains the mother’s attitude and behavior. Why is she so negatively impressed with the building that she prefers to abandon her children without even saying goodbye to them?I am aware that a lot of people find this story engaging. My opinion of it probably belongs to a minority but I must admit, this was a boring and unemotional read for me. I am now trying to find something that I liked about it. The only thing that comes to my mind is that the story did not last too long. In addition, the cover of the book is exquisite."

Because I get a lot of her books as donations, and they go as quickly as they come. She is an interesting author, who in my mind, embodies compassion.How would I describe this tale? Paradise Lost dusted with a sprinkling of Cinderella, The Little Princess and perhaps a bit of Hansel and Gretel thrown in?Two bonded siblings, Maeve and Danny Conroy have only each other after their mother leaves them when they are only 10 and 3. Their home is called the Dutch House, a 1922 mansion outside Philadelphia owned by their father, Cyril, bought fully furnished when Maeve was 5. His wife hated it, and flees to India to support the poor. Her family suffers by this loss, and are left with a father who only cares about his real estate. The lust of it. And then...Enter the wicked stepmother with 2 kids of her own. The story is told in first person from Danny's adult POV. Because Danny is by design a clueless tight-lipped character, as readers we aren't sure he really is the best one to be telling this story. His older sister may have been a more interesting character to have told the story. Or better yet, an unbiased narrator. The story focuses on unconventional families - motherless children, blended families and children left too much to their own devices. Does it work?Still...You can feel the themes of gratitude, compassion and forgiveness and a sentimentality throughout. A sense of warmheartedness, too. It's just hard to find sometimes."
85,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4876540-jonetta,Rating 4 out of 5,"Cyril Conroy turns to real estate investment at the end of World War II and transforms his family’s circumstances from impoverishment to wealth. When he surprises them with a move to the Philadelphia suburbs and the purchase of a great mansion called The Dutch House, it also alters the course of everyone he cares about, and not in a good way. Their stories are told through his son Danny and spans several decades, providing a view of how their futures are shaped by the ensuing events. Tom Hanks narrates the audio version of the book and felt like the perfect choice for Danny Conroy. The character was fairly dispassionate, a creation of his upbringing as he was shielded from the wreckage of his parents’ marriage and history. He was too young to recall much of it and his sister Maeve protected him beyond adulthood. Hanks’ performance was outstanding in that regard as he personified Danny. But Maeve was the more complex character and we only see her through his eyes. But, that made her all the more enigmatic and tragic as her world seemed to evolve around his. This is a long saga without a lot of dramatic moments but does have significant, pivotal events that permanently define Danny and Maeve. They sometimes served them well but also stunted their ability to form deep relationships as adults. I enjoyed their journey and was captivated by the story. I didn’t always like Danny but understood him. But it is Maeve who got my admiration and empathy, someone I wanted to know more about but love that she’s left to my imagination. And, The Dutch House was always in the background. It’s an ideal story for book group discussions.Posted on Blue Mood Café"

87,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75748905-elizabeth,Rating 3 out of 5,"Elna Conroy sheds all her worldly possessions—leaving her husband behind and young children Danny and Maeve adrift in the tranquil suburbs of Elkins Park, Philadelphia—to dedicate her life to the impoverished in all corners of the world. It is circa 1950, and also left behind is the breathtaking three-story mansion that is the Dutch House, replete with a ballroom, marble floors, gilded ceilings, vast windows, and the arresting portraits of the previous VanHoebeek residents. Ann Patchett has masterfully injected life into the relics of the Gilded Age New England mansions, children and nannies and cooks flitting through these lavish halls in a fairy-tale narration by Danny. Reflecting most on his youth and the aftermath in decades later, this story relives a past populated by Mr. Conroy, remiss to warm his children with nurture and compassion, and the clear villain, Cinderella’s stepmother come to life in the form of his second wife Andrea, a package deal with two daughters not much younger than Danny and Maeve. The Dutch House is concerned of course with the repercussions when Danny and Maeve are unceremoniously ousted from their childhood home after Mr. Conroy passes away, straight back into the poverty their father had escaped from. A window into this progression of events invokes the kind of pulsing anger that eats at your chest, as you must also swallow the bitter pills of snubs and cold silence and inaction that children never should. It is the kind of change in a childhood that leaves little gray area to debate, distinctly horrible yet unstoppable nevertheless. And so, these myriad traps are primed in the past even as the Dutch House becomes a distant memory and Danny and Maeve both forge successful paths into adulthood. So inevitably they return, no longer welcome in the House but parked in a Volkswagen, the Oldsmobile, the Volvos, inhaling cigarette smoke with nostalgic memories and a past-present mirage about the unanswered questions of their childhood. 
There was no extra time in those days and I didn’t want to spend the little of it I had sitting in front of the goddamn house, but that’s where we wound up: like swallows, like salmon, we were the helpless captives of our migratory patterns.
I would never trade away Patchett’s magnificently executed quippy dialogue, dark humor, and effortless descriptions, but I needed this to be matched by equal development of the characters. I was desperate to crack open their skulls, to carefully examine their true thoughts and motivations. A reticent father and an absent mother are aspects I could come to accept of a childhood fraught with maddening experiences, but dangling all this potential only to have such a reticent protagonist in Danny just felt unfair. What did come through was Danny’s self-absorption and, frankly, petulant monologue. He is a rich boy muddled into unfair circumstances, soaking up a rainshower of tragedies but resistant to the responsibility of taking off the coat. He is at least self-aware enough to admit his faults, though does next to nothing to address them, so I couldn’t even blame him for ignorance. From childhood to adulthood, he is a boy in a world that demands he grow up too soon—except he doesn’t really grow up. At each step of the way, his older sister Maeve has provided a steady and unconditional love that his parents never did. Danny’s unfettered adulation of his sister filters through his narrative lens, and I couldn’t help but champion her brilliance, humor, and pragmatism. His regrets, then, also shine through, as he acknowledges an imperfect understanding of her innermost desires despite their closeness. Always from his perspective, I never could see her as much more than a sacrificial lamb. Wholly dedicated to caring for him, just as later his wife is characterized. There are so many passive moments and no real heroes throughout this family saga in The Dutch House, and if I must come to terms with how people reconcile the past and choose whether to forgive amid the more eyebrow-raising plot points of this fairy tale, I at the very least can’t afford to miss a deep connection to the central characters."

Just him reading the chapter headings was thrilling, and he gave so much MORE! My biggest regret is getting SO into the story that I mostly stopped realized that Tom Hanks was reading to me. Bravo Ann Patchett and Tom Hanks. This is a story about a house that several families have lived in and the lives that have been touched by residing in this house at one time or another. It is about the coming of age and the adult life of a boy named Danny. Danny's life is inexorably influenced entirely by the Dutch House, with memories both good and bad and the reverberations of many things set into motion by both love and hatred of the house. This one was quite enjoyable, a solid 4 stars. I really liked it. And I REALLY hated Andrea."
89,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1213607-julie,Rating 4 out of 5,"Danny Conroy and his older sister, Maeve, sit in Maeve's car across the street from their childhood home, watching, waiting, reviving the ghosts of their memories. They catch an occasional glimpse of their stepmother, Andrea, who turned them out of the house soon after their father died, when Danny was in high school and Maeve was in college, but they leave her be. There are deeper wounds than an evil stepmother to contend with, and even though the mansion they spy upon has enormous windows that provide views from front to back, the source of their pain — and their healing — is not visible. The Dutch House, so named for its Depression-era builders, the VanHoebeeks from the Netherlands, is a bizarrely baroque edifice, purchased in secret by Danny and Maeve's father, Cyril, in 1946. Maeve was five and Danny would be born two years later. Cyril Conroy had been quietly amassing a small fortune by speculating in New York City real estate, and came upon this mansion in the countryside near Philadelphia, falling for its in-your-face declaration of wealth. Cyril presents it to his wife, Elna, who recoils at its opulence and the servants Cyril has hired to help manage the estate. Elna, so disturbed by a life that feels imposed on her by Cyril's grasping ambitions, eventually abandons her two young children and vanishes, supposedly settling in India to minister to the poor. A few years later, Cyril marries Andrea, eighteen years his junior, barely older than Maeve herself. Andrea has two little girls of her own and quickly takes charge of The Dutch House, her resentment of Cyril's first family building to a near-unforgivable vindictiveness that results in Maeve and Danny's expulsion. The Dutch House is grounded in Danny's first-person perspective as he gently unknots forty years of familial entanglements. In contrast to Danny's matter-of-fact memories is a shimmering fairy tale nostalgia of gingerbread houses, a wicked stepmother, the Hansel and Gretel bond between brother and sister, a long-lost mother, even the Rapunzel-like quality of Maeve's long, dark hair. Some Ann Patchett novels have taken my breath away (Bel Canto), others have left me less moved. The Dutch House succeeds for me because of the strength of its characters, who are allowed to grow and reach, creating a story in their wake. Tales of fortunes won and lost over decades, a panorama of post-war American culture, unhappy families, the ebbs and flows of marriage — these are all familiar themes that become fresh and urgent by the strength of Patchett's Danny and Maeve and their voices. Told with reflective compassion, gentle irony, and vivid nostalgia for an America long-gone, The Dutch House is a deeply satisfying family drama."
90,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6700518-lorna,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Dutch House is the latest novel by one of my favorite authors Ann Patchett. This character driven family saga centers around the powerful relationship between siblings Maeve and Danny Conroy as well as their strong connection, and almost pathological ties, to The Dutch House. This beautiful mansion was built by the VanHoebeeks in the suburbs of Philadelphia in 1922 making their fortune in cigarettes; their life-sized portrait so much a part of the Conroy family in many ways. I must interject that the cover of the book that is a portrait of Maeve is priceless. There is a message here. Their father, Cyril Conroy, a real estate mogul able to capitalize on a lot of real estate deals in New York City enabling him to purchase this iconic house where Danny and Maeve spent their childhood. Without any spoilers, what transpires over the years is the exploration of the bonds between Maeve and Danny as they grow into adulthood and how The Dutch House impacts their lives over a lifetime. Told in the point of view of Danny over the years, it is subject to memory and is very non-linear in its unfolding as we jump to different periods in their life. All in all, it is a very heartwarming book that I enjoyed.""The stunning success of the house could be attributed to the architect. . .""""It could be that one or both of those dour VanHoebeeks had been sort of aesthetic visionary, or that the property inspired a marvel beyond what any of them had imagined, or that America after the First World War was teeming with craftsmen who worked to standards long since abandoned. Whatever the explanation, the house wound up with--the house we later wound up with--was a singular confluence of talent and luck.""""But we overlay the present onto the past, we look back through the lens of what we know now, so we're not seeing it as the people we were, we're seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.""""There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you'd been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet in place, and for a moment you're suspended, knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself.""""'For the record, I'm sick of misery,' she said, then she turned and went back inside, leaving me to stand in the swirl of leaves and think about what I owed her.

The business-savvy Cyril Conroy buys the house and everything in it to surprise his wife, Elma and their young children, Maeve and Danny. Overwhelmed by the huge change from living frugally in a very small house to living in a grand old house, with a cook, a cleaner and a nanny, the young mother eventually abandons her family.Written from Danny's point of view, this is a novel about family, abandonment and its effects, hanging on the past and not letting go. Danny's sister, Maeve, seven years his senior, becomes his mentor and protector, while the two sisters working as cook and cleaner, respectively, take on the caring roles.When things get worse for the two siblings, their relationship is what gives them strength, their intelligence and ambition what propels them further to outward success.The Dutch House features prominently throughout the novel. Detested, loved, admired, longed for, the house pulls at the hearts and memories of those who lived in it.Spanning over five decades, at times, the story sags as it becomes quite mundane. But it's very readable; the details, the little scenes and recollections make it very lifelike. You know how it is, you're a teen, then you study, begin your grown-up life and then, bam! you wonder what happened to time, when did you get to be forty, fifty etc. The last quarter picks up the pace, quite a lot happens.I thoroughly enjoyed this novel, the characterisations were excellent, the descriptions, of the house in particular, were quite vivid. The siblings' relationship was incredibly tight and unique.This was different, in a good way. Highly recommended. I've received this novel via Edelweiss, in exchange for an honest review."

Despite the fact that Patchett is an author I’ve wanted to read for a long time -- I’ve had most of her previous works on my TBR for quite some time and even own physical copies of several of her books -- I unfortunately have not had the opportunity to actually crack open any of them. Of course, all that changed last week when I saw that the next book on my seemingly never-ending ARC list would be Patchett’s newly released eighth novel 
The Dutch House
 (published in September 2019) – I was thrilled that I would finally be able to experience one of her works for myself, though at the same time, that also meant I would be going into this one with relatively high expectations. Luckily, this one ended up being a wonderful read, even better than I expected, which honestly doesn’t happen often.The story is narrated entirely from the perspective of Danny Conroy, who is only a boy of 8 years old when the story opens. His sister Maeve, herself only a teenager at 15 years old, took Danny under her care after their mother Elna left them 5 years ago. Both children live in the Dutch House, a see-through glass mansion of sorts that their father Cyril, a real estate developer, had bought as a surprise gift for their mother. Cyril is a distant father who is always consumed with his work and aside from providing his children with the necessities — a cook to prepare food for them to eat, a housekeeper to tend to the household duties, a nanny to tend to their day-to-day needs — he could never be bothered with much else beyond that. But Maeve and Danny had each other to lean on and along with the love of their housekeeper and cook (sisters Sandy and Jocelyn who had been hired by their mother back in the day), they were relatively happy and content with their lives. All that changes however when Cyril decides to marry a young woman named Andrea, who moves into the Dutch House with her 2 daughters in tow — the profound impact that this decision ends up having on Danny’s and Maeve’s futures becomes the basis upon which the entire story revolves.This story is billed as a family saga spanning 5 decades, which initially made me think that it would be so epic in scope that it would take a longer time to read, but in actuality, I devoured this one, not wanting to put it down once I started. Patchett is a masterful storyteller and her writing here absolutely captivates — I was hooked from the very first page, not just to the story but also to the characters. It’s extremely rare for me to already like and connect with a story’s characters within the first few chapters, but that’s exactly what happened with Danny and Maeve — two characters I loved from the beginning and who continued to grow more endearing as the story progressed. While all of Patchett’s characters in here were nuanced and well-developed (even most of the minor characters), what made me gravitate to Danny and Maeve the most was the unshakable bond that these two siblings shared throughout their lives – a bond that continued to exist despite everything that happens, no matter how many times their relationship is put to the test. Needless to say, I was genuinely moved by their relationship. Speaking of characters, of course the Dutch House itself also existed as a “character” central to the story, however the beauty here is that, even though its presence was continually felt throughout the story, it never once overtook the other characters. Despite the house’s significance to the plot, it was quite clear from beginning to end that the story itself belonged to Maeve and Danny. In this regard, the house serves as a connection to their past and while this past is what shapes who they eventually grow up to become as adults, it is also how they deal with this past that forms the crux of their story. Here, again, the brilliance of Patchett’s writing comes into play, as the transitions between past and present throughout the book were seamless – no easy feat given the extensive timeline that the story covered plus the fact that the plot jumped around from one situation to the next in no particular order.Up until the last few chapters, this actually had all the makings of a 5-star read for me – the reason I eventually decided on 4.5 stars was mainly because I wasn’t fond of the ending and also didn’t like how a few plot points played out in the lasts few chapters. Though I must admit that I also had some issues with the character of Elna Conroy (Danny and Maeve’s mother) – things that made her character come across too unrealistic for me and made it difficult for me to wholeheartedly accept some of the situations that happen because of it. This small complaint aside, I still consider this book a masterpiece – not quite perfect, but a masterpiece nonetheless. While I eagerly wait to see what Patchett has in store for us next, there’s no doubt that I will be exploring her backlist of previous works very, very soon!Received ARC from Harper via Edelweiss. "

The 1920’s mansion comes complete with staff, life-size portraits of the original Dutch owners, a third floor ballroom, and a perfect window seat. Elna, who grew up poor, hates the extravagance of the house. She runs away to serve the poor, abandoning her 10-year-old daughter, Maeve, and three-year-old son, Danny, to the hands of their rigid and cold father.Five years later, Maeve and Danny are called downstairs to meet Conroy’s soon-to-be second wife, Andrea. The second Mrs. Conroy adores the house and all the money that goes along with it. When Cyril dies, she keeps the house and the money and dispossesses Maeve and Danny of any inheritance except for funds for Danny’s education. Danny and Maeve creatively use the education trust fund to send Danny to Choate, Columbia, and medical school, despite the simple fact he has absolutely no desire to become a doctor. REVIEWTHE DUTCH HOUSE is a perfect blend of characters, setting and story. It’s undoubtably my favorite book of the year. ANN PATCHETT has long been my favorite author, and this book is one of her best. It’s masterfully written to capture the poignant relationship and unbreakable bonds between Danny and Maeve. A grown Danny narrates the story casting his sister as his unwavering friend and protector.I didn’t want the book to end, and deliberately savored it a little slower that usual. The Dutch house vividly comes to life on the pages. We can see all the way from the driveway through the house to the conservatory, and we can see the little blue kitchen table where Danny frequently had his meals and did his homework and it is so easy to picture the large portrait hanging on the wall of the drawing room of a bright-eyed Maeve in her red coat, with her long thick black hair laying over her shoulders.The story thoughtfully explores abandonment, inheritance, obsession, family relationships, love and forgiveness. PATCHETT is a lyrical storyteller and her characters development is first rate. My favorite part of the novel is the shared moments between Danny and Maeve, sitting in Maeve’s car in front of the Dutch House long after they had been expelled from the only home they had known. THE DUTCH HOUSE is a beautiful and strong testament to sibling bonds. Thanks to Edelweiss, Harper Collins and Ann Patchett for an advance reading copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

Such an important word, one that conjures both memories, dreams, and nightmares. So many phrases have used this word: A home is where the heart is, A house is not a home, A woman's place is in the home (Elna and I do not agree with this one),You can never go home, A home is a man's castle, and so many more. Most, however, do not become obsessed by a past home. For many reasons Mauve and Danny do, and this obsession continues with Danny's daughter May. I think Mauve and Celeste's reciting of Philip Larkin's poem Home Is So Sad is very significant and paramount to this obsession.There are so many important elements in this book that have been beautifully detailed by other reviewers. Love between siblings in this book and siblings throughout history, loss. forgiveness, hope, and following your dreams, or not, among others. I think timing, both good timing and not so good is also an important element. Elna enters their life again by chance timing. Danny after finishing medical school says, ""I'll have to go out and find a job and that won't be the right time. I can say that for the rest of my life, can't I? This isn't the right time."" Danny meets Celeste due to a missed train. He works hard to finish his medical training, not because he enjoys it but because he doesn't want to get drafted. He believes Celeste was ""the ultimate victim of bad timing, thinking that because she was good at chemistry she should marry a doctor instead of becoming one herself."" But was that really what Celeste wanted? Did Mauve really want to further her education? Danny is just like Celeste and Mauve. They all thought they knew what was best for someone else. A doctor was not Danny's dream profession. He followed his dream of buying and fixing buildings. He was successful at this but he could not fix the past.Anne Patchett has long been a favorite author of mine This book is yet another example of her fine writing style. Her characters are so real with their strengths and flaws rawly exposed. No matter how dire or solemn a situation is that Patchett describes there is a grain, a dash, of humor, enough to bring a smile to the reader's face.This is an October bookclub selection and I am anxiously anticipating our discussion of this enjoyable, complex book.

99,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/121021140-ushashi,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Dutch House is a family drama. It's not high on the plot. It's a study of characters and exploration of relationships. It's a dysfunctional family, neither the characters are perfect, nor are their relations. And yet there is something charming and relatable about them. The main focus here is on the relation between the narrator Danny and his elder sister Maeve. I often felt that a modern brother-sister relation is not that well represented in literature, and this was just delightful. The Dutch House is also fairy tale-esque, with a palatial mansion, evil stepmother, orphaned children. This is story-telling at its best. Tom Hanks' narration was just perfect. If you are into audiobooks or like Mr. Hanks (who doesn't!), consider listening to this."

101,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9827967-deb,Rating 5 out of 5,"“There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you’d been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to stand on is not yet in place, and for a moment you’re suspended, knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself.”When I read this sentence in The Dutch House by Ann Patchett, my adoration for her writing was again reinforced, and I almost needed to read no further. Her ability as a wordsmith at times is so poetic, cuttingly painful and spare in its description of the most traumatic moments caught in ordinary time, in ordinary lives... But of course I continued to read, to discover more of Patchett’s wondrous offerings. Danny and Maeve suffer through interminable losses, which begin at an early point during their lifetimes and The Dutch House figures prominently throughout as a figurehead of that loss. “The Dutch House was impossible. I had never thought that before. When Maeve told me that our mother had hated it, I couldn’t even understand what she was saying. ... I could feel the entire house sitting on top of me like a shell I would have to drag around for the rest of my life.”The delicacy of this novel’s writing is found in how these siblings nurture each other, try to find a sense of home in each other while the world outside of them with more “normal” upbringings and trappings live somewhat on their outskirts and truly cannot fathom the need for their bond. Patchett manages in her books to describe relationships which are on the outskirts, wrought by trauma and the people who try to survive them as well as possible - and describe how beauty might be wrought from the ruin nevertheless. The Dutch House is a gorgeous example of Patchett at her best. The ending is hopeful and a trifle more fairytale than truth. The Dutch House, though, is fictitious too, so who am I to split hairs with this otherwise heart healing fable? An exquisite tapestry of imagery, characters whom I came to love dearly and a sigh of contentment at closing the final page. It doesn’t get much better than this. Five gracious stars. "

It was very enjoyable.It is the story of Maeve and Danny Conroy narrated by by Tom Hanks, told in the voice of Danny.Cyril Conroy buys this amazing house to surprise his wife. It is called the Dutch House. His wife dislikes it from the beginning. She abandons her husband and children to help the poor. Maeve and Danny have a strong bond to one another. Cyril remarries and the ugly stepmother tells Danny he must leave, after the death of his father.Maeve was already on her own.As the years go on Danny and Maeve reflect on their lives at the Dutch House. They even go and park the car in front of it and just watch it, when they are no longer living there.This book is beautifully written.

It’s a building with huge, wide windows, giving every passerby the opportunity to look inside. A function reflected by Danny’s narration. He offers a way in, clear-eyed but still intensely personal. It’s a story about everything and nothing, detailing how family dynamics are affected by the Dutch House and each other. It’s a dream for book clubs, full to the brim of characters that affect you in ways that are as much due to the real people of whom they remind you as their roles within the story. It’s full of questions that invite judgement and decisions that demand reactions. Overall, it's effectively done, more gripping than the details of the plot might suggest, and with a genuinely affecting sibling relationship at its heart. ARC via Netgalley"

The cover was the best part, that's what.Everything else was a Humpty Dumpty of a story, balancing on a pile of hard to believe premises for this quiet family drama. Actually I was thinking of the list of stuff that I find utterly unbelievable in this book, but I don't want to spoil on one hand, and on another - I am not going to not recommend this book. I think that just maybe it's not for me. I believe that someone might actually enjoy it, maybe people who can relate to siblings' problems, I don't know, Cinderella, Snow White? Hamlet???And I'm going to be fair - the beginning was interesting, attracting at least, so was the final twist (quite a weird one), but between those two was a vast sea of BOREDOM. I was wondering if it was done on purpose as a metaphor to show us life that Danny and Maeve were living after the Expulsion from the Garden of Eden, I mean - the Dutch House. Not like their life was too exciting before the expulsion... I couldn't see it this way at all.Well, thanks gods I can deal with boring if it's well written. And it was well written, otherwise I would probably drop it somewhere on page 100, but... Like one of my teachers used to say - constructed by all the rules, but no spark of life in it. I would probably prefer it as one of those Hallmark movies - while equally forgettable it would be much more merciful to the time spent watching it.All in all - you might actually end up liking it.

I think this is a classic case of it's-not-you-it's-me. I found the writing adept but prosaic; fine for a plot-driven novel but this was more character-driven, and in these sorts of novels I prefer more ""literary"" fiction (even though I tend to avoid that term because of various reasons) with devices such as stream-of-consciousness, poetic prose, etc, especially if written in the first person, which this is. The writing wasn't bad by any means, and there were a couple of deft turns of phrase, but overall i just think it didn't fit with the character-driven nature of the book. This is just my preference, though, and a lot of people really enjoyed this. I'd keep away if you prefer more flowery writing in your character-driven books, but if you hate that sort of thing (which a lot of people do) then you might like this. But it just fell flat for me.

107,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38727943-jenna,Rating 4 out of 5,"Well, this book needs another review like Tom Hanks needs another Oscar... ...wait a minute...HAS Tom Hanks won an Oscar?? One sec......Ok, we’re cool! Thanks for waiting! He does have one, whew. Two, in fact!* Although, to be fair, it’s been a while. Anywho, my point here is that: Wouldn’t it be absolutely amazing to be one of those artists of some sort - literary, or of stage and film or whatnot - who retain integrity and exemplify skill while also remaining palatable, nay, even pleasurable, and in general kind of infallible?As an inconsistent hot and cold ADHD-riddled late-bloomer (still waiting!), I’m absolutely enthralled by those artists/scientists who embody and exceed solid consistency, the ones you’d always choose to safely land the plane of your precious, goose-addled attention in the torrid, soiled Hudson of your human consciousness.How, in the actual fuck, are there artists who are so good at that, and whose souvenir gold lapel wings you’d gladly not only sport on your most carefree weekend warrior red eye getaway, but also strive to safeguard for the ages and confer to your descendants? What I’m trying to say is, Ann Patchett, along with Tom Hanks (recent audiobook Beatrice to the Dante of her prose, and that’s why he’s here): I mean, they just don’t seem capable of significantly quantifiable missteps. Take a gander (ha! I’m sorry - just kinda obsessed with Sully) at the lists of their works. Sure, you may not like them all. You may have your favorites. For instance, I’m more of a Commonwealth gal myself. But, as their records presently stand, you’d be hard pressed to majorly sway either popular or critical tomato-meters in their general disfavor. They.are.just.good. That ship has sailed... and! ...Captain Phillips is at the helm! sorry couldn’t resist!!But, you would be reading this review to learn more about The Dutch House, not about my preoccupation with transportation-centric Hanks films. So, here is a quick recap of some specific identified reasons why this book is good:-It’s Goldfinch-adjacent/reminiscent, as other far wiser reader/reviewers have also confirmed. But, minus the explosions and international art thievery - omissions which can ONLY improve a book written by anyone OTHER than Donna Tartt!-The whole House as Character thing, and who does not have a big fat red carpet Welcome Mat for that??-I mean seriously, it’s like you’re not even “reading” a Patchett book when you are reading it; it’s not even like you are watching a movie (not even a Tom Hanks movie!): this crazy phenomenon happens with her effortless prose where you are just somehow “living” the book. I personally felt like I aged thirty years or whatever while reading this, in the best possible way, and that I enjoyed this is especially shocking because aging is my most actively coming horribly true by the millisecond fear.-Super character driven, but, like, just enough stuff happens also?-Families and money, parents and siblings, Fa la la la la, la la la la! Happy holidays! :-)-That kind of historical fiction that’s just baaaarely on the cusp of being historical (just like many of us readers, har har!).-People who simply cannot let go of grudges, and the havoc wrought on self/other by both these grudges and the intractable retention thereof. This book portrays nothing if not the giant grudge match that is immediate and extended family, whether via passive aggressive virtue signaling or outright vengeance plots.-Like baroque wallpapering, people are destined to endlessly and elaborately repeat the often nonsensical behavioral and relational coping patterns of their ways, or of the ways others have modeled for them. Do I have anything bad to say about this book? - unlike The Goldfinch, I didn’t rate it a 5, after all? Sure, I could compile a shortlist of questions, continuity errors, and conspiracy theories, including but not limited to the ending of the book, which increasingly felt like I was reading a different book and, ultimately, something more worthy of the Lifetime or CW (the daughter May stuff? Come ON!) networks rather than the big screen? Plenty of other reviewers have already commented on all of this, and so I’ll let them tell you about it.I think some even great authors just have trouble landing a book sometimes - let’s not forget that even The Goldfinch ended with basically an essay, and I’m sorry, love the book, but that IS cheating - and The Dutch House is definitely not a Sully-caliber landing (no, I can’t let it rest). But even though I think it would have been better with an explicitly more bittersweet, Cast Away-style ending, this book, and Patchett, still remain...in a League of Their Own. :-)*Best Actor for Philadelphia (1993) and Forrest Gump (1994)"

When each and every aspect is amazing in and of itself, but then the whole is even GREATER than its parts. You can't explain why, but you know you just read something incredible. That was what this book was like for me. The setting, the characters, the dialogue, the story, the audio narration, the book cover... EVERYTHING! For me, this book was sheer perfection, and I adored it! Patchett creates a feel for this story that is both real-life and dark fairy tale at the same time. The characters feel real, with all their flaws and quirkiness, and Patchett explores real themes, like familial love, sibling relationship, abandonment, inheritance, obsession, forgiveness, and more. But there's also this hint of a dreamy, dark fairy tale feel to the story, with a long-lost mother, an evil stepmother, and a brother and sister cast out. The result is a highly enticing narrative that draws you in and keeps you turning pages.Patchett is a master storyteller down to every single microscopic detail - the house/mansion really comes alive as a character itself, inseparable from the story. Even the gorgeous book cover of the painting that was in the house... Patchett had an artist friend actually create the painting specifically to use for the cover. And, finally, using Tom Hanks as audio narrator was a brilliant touch for this book! The story is told first-person narrative by the brother Danny, and Tom Hank's portrayal of him was just perfect, elevating the book to TEN STARS for me! This experience is one that is resonating with me long after I listened to the last word."

A story of family betrayal, an inheritance and legacy robbed but a triumph in the bond between two siblings.The story is told through the eyes of Danny who is every bit as obsessed as his father about real estate. Maeve, his sister, on the other hand went to school in New York and returned to Philadelphia to help run a small business away from real estate. The bond between brother and sister strengthened even further after the death of their father, when Danny was asked to move out of the Dutch House by his stepmother and moved into Maeve’s small apartment. Nor was he given the opportunity to run the business his father built up despite working with him on rent collection. Danny did, however, take advantage of the funding left to him for his education and went to the best education institutions money could buy. However, the rift and grudges held by Andrea, never healed.The story takes us through Danny’s relationship with his wife and a long overdue healing process with his own mother who abandoned them decades earlier.

Ann Patchett has a beautiful grasp of human nature and the cyclical nature of families. Tom Hanks is an absolute dream as a narrator. Told over five decades, this is the story of three generations of the Conroy family, told from the POV of Danny Conroy. Cyril and Elna Conroy are Irish immigrants. Cyril becomes successful in real estate after WWII, Elna doesn’t realize this. She believes them to be poor. She wears “poor” like it’s her identity. He surprises her and their young daughter Maeve with The Dutch House, a gorgeous, estate complete with household help. Elna is uncomfortable in the plush surroundings. Cyril oblivious, is laser focused on work. His focus on his job becomes a double edged sword both lifting his family out of poverty and becoming a convenient excuse to ignore them. He had an issue with not realizing who the people around him actually were to the detriment of the family unit as a whole . Eventually, Andrea the “Evil” stepmother enters the story with her eye on Cyril and even more-so on the house. She brings two kind daughters into the fold. The children all get along. The adults are the source of the drama. When Cyril dies the Conroy heirs are put out of the house by Andrea. Maeve has completed college, but Danny is still a high school student. Danny is left with only a trust for his education from his father. Maeve steps in to meet with the family attorney on his behalf. Through the trust, she sets him up at a boarding school so Danny has a place to live. Danny and his sister Maeve have a Velcro close bond that intensifies each time life deals them a blow. Maeve is a cornerstone for Danny in many ways. They not only hold close to one another, but also to the past counting the slights and losses together. As someone who was abandoned by a parent myself, I understood the full range of emotions Danny experienced. His thought process on the subject was realistic. Danny’s love for Maeve was palpable. It came across in full color and made her larger than life. Maeve being the older of the two when their mother abandoned them left her with deep longing instead of anger because she had good memories to hold on to whereas Danny had nothing. She also had to grow up faster because she was taking on more responsibilities at a young age. Maeve is an easy character to love not only because we see her through Danny’s eyes and he loves her, but she reminds me of the best in people despite her flaws. Maeve makes a genuine effort at each stage of her life on others’ behalf in the midst of whatever difficulties she might be facing. She is incredible. The past, present, and a sliver of hope looking forward kept me captivated throughout this brilliant character driven novel. Spectacular.All. The. Stars.⭐️ A few quotes I loved ⬇️“We had made a fetish out of our misfortune, fallen in love with it. ““She was a magnificent child, and the whole world was laid out in front of her, covered in stars.”“You have to serve those who need to be served. Not just those who make you feel good about yourself.”"

The fairy tale like structure -- abandoned children, amazing house, and evil stepmother -- provide a structure for Maeve and Danny to look at the past and see how the stories they have told themselves have shaped them, a look at childhood myth versus a more adult analysis of these events.Patchett's skilled writing brings out her characters' deep, complex emotions and is able to express both the points of view of Danny the child and Danny the mature adult.Definitely worth your time."

I often find it very hard to get into audiobooks and end up stopping and moving to an actual book, but he really just brought the story to life. This book was very well written. The characters and their relationships were done exceptionally well and were extremely relatable. The story is very much about the love and connection between siblings, which I really related with, and the meaning of home. It also has a strong message about how much the decisions we make affect others. It can often affect them more than we even know because it can be hard to come to terms with the repercussions of a decision that affects you so much but that you had no say in. That loss of control can be hard to reckon with.Overall, I thought this book was really beautiful and I definitely recommend it!"

The Dutch House is a journey through life that focuses on the terrible consequences of miscommunications, and how intentions are so easily misunderstood; how it is nearly always impossible to repair trust and pride when it has been damaged; how the seeds of discontent and regret are quick to grow, and how bad memories can haunt a house for generations. This is also a story that is tender and touching, a homage to all the siblings who step up to care for their families, all of the love that endures ongoing hardships. Thoughtful and wistful, this saga of misfortunes and perseverance is a sentimental walk thorough time and memory. "

Date: September 24, 2019After reading a mystery, a feel-good story, and a psychological thriller, this reviewer felt overjoyed to sink my teeth into literary fiction once again. I can and do appreciate some contemporary reads, but this mythical novel felt like coming home, especially since the story explores the meaning of home itself. It is not a spoiler to point out that this is a family-saga disguised as a dark fairy tale revolving around a house. The author breathes as much life into the house as the characters. It is not farfetched to say that the house itself is the main protagonist.The book begins in 1946 when a real estate mogul buys a fully furnished, Gatsby-like mansion, as a surprise for his wife. Turns out that she hates the house, but his five-year-old daughter loves it. Their son is born 8 years later. The narrative jumps around in time through the son’s voice. When the boy is three-years-old, his mother deserts the family, leaving the siblings devastated. This is how his older sister becomes his main caretaker. The bond between them is unwavering, even when the boy is a grown man. Their closeness puts a strain on his marriage. When the siblings are 12 and 19 years old, their father marries a young widow with two little girls of her own. The wicked stepmother has arrived. When the older sister visits home during a college break, she discovers that her stepmother has given her bedroom—which is the best room in the house—to her little stepsisters. An unused room in the attic is now her bedroom.The author does a good job of showing rage through humor throughout the novel. When the older sister learns about the room change she laughs and says, “It’s just like ‘The Little Princess!’ when the girl (Shirley Temple in the movie version of the book), loses all of her money and so they put her in the attic.” She demonstrates this skill with all of her characters, including the loving and long-suffering nanny, cook and housekeeper. The only small room in the house is the kitchen. As the cook says, “that was because the only people ever meant to see the kitchen were the servants.”It would be wise to remember that you are reading a fairytale, if not the book will feel unrealistic. Put in the fairytale genre, the story is as fascinating as the author’s 2011 novel, “State of Wonder,” which also has a mythical feel. “House” stayed with me after I finished the book. I deliberately did not read the initial reviews. (I missed the ARC reviewers’ suggested deadline on this one). I came to believe that the book is mostly a coming-of-age story, as well as a reflection on one’s childhood as an adult. The author seems to ask the question, ‘Why do we repeat the same mistakes as our parents?’ In addition, she wonders, ‘Why do some of us have childhoods that could have been written by the Brothers Grimm?’ Finally, ‘What might one may need to accomplish to change our life story’s ending?’I received this Advance Review Copy (ARC) novel from the publisher at no cost in exchange for an honest review.Find all my book reviews at: https://www.goodreads.com/review/list...https://books6259.wordpress.com/https://www.barnesandnoble.com/review...https://www.facebook.com/martie.neesr...https://www.instagram.com/martie6947/https://www.pinterest.com/martienreco...\https://www.amazon.com/https://twitter.com/NeesRecord"

It is a readable and sometimes moving family story, and is beautifully crafted. So why didn't I give it five stars?

He and his sister Maeve grew up in The Dutch House, a palatial mansion just outside of Philadelphia. Their father was a successful business man who invested in real estate, and was proud of his purchase of the house. Their mother never adjusted to the vanity of the house and left when Danny and Maeve were children. They felt safe and protected in the house and were loved and cared for by their beloved housekeeper and cook. Things changed drastically though when their father remarried and his new wife, Andrea, and her two daughters moved in. When their father dies unexpectedly, Andrea kicks them out of the house and cuts them off from their father's wealth. Maeve, now an adult, is responsible for Danny's care. She and Danny grow incredibly close as Maeve guides Danny towards his future.

Y pensándolo ahora, después de terminarlo, creo que es cierto.Tiene muchas cosas que te recuerda a los cuentos clásicos: la falta de la figura de la madre, una madrastra mala(¿?), un padre que apenas aparece por la vida de sus hijos, los niños que finalmente son apartados de su hogar...Obviamente no todo es como en los cuentos, y creo que la autora ha creado una trama bastante realista, y por ello bastante cruda.Quizás lo que más llamó mi atención, y no para bien en este caso, es que los protagonistas (los dos hermanos) empiezan y terminan igual, o al menos su forma de expresarse y de hablar es igual; no importa que tengan 15 y 22, o que tengan 45 y 52.Aun así tanto ella como él caen bien y eso ayuda.Un libro entretenido, con una trama que te hará cabrear, que te hará sonreír, que te hará pensar, que te hará sentir."

Was some character going to turn up to make this house memorable. Nope. Never happened. Not one character appealed to me. All were vanilla, not finely drawn. The lost mother turning up again and winning over her children after decades was so unbelievable. I loved Bel Canto but this left me cold! "

129,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,Rating 4 out of 5,"Maeve and Danny Conroy are an inseparable brother-and-sister pair. Their mother left when Danny was little, so his older sister played a maternal role, too. And when their father dies, they become like Hansel and Gretel (or Cinderella and her little brother): cast out into the wilds by an evil stepmother who takes possession of the only home they’ve ever known, a suburban Philadelphia mansion built on the proceeds of the VanHoebeeks’ cigarette empire.It’s interesting to see Patchett take on a male perspective in this novel; she does it utterly convincingly. I also loved the medical threads running through: Maeve is diagnosed with diabetes as a teenager, and Danny spends many years in medical training even though his only ambition is to follow in his father’s footsteps as a property developer. There was a stretch in the middle of the book – something like 46% to 58% – when I was really bored with Danny’s dithering (‘but I don’t want to be a doctor … but I don’t want to marry Celeste’), and the chronology is unnecessarily complicated by flashbacks, though this is, I think, meant to convey Danny’s desultory composition of his memoirs.In the end I didn’t like this quite as much as Commonwealth, but it’s a winning exploration of family secrets and memories. As the decades pass you see how what happened to Maeve and Danny has been turned into myth: a story they repeat to themselves about how they were usurped until the narrative has more power than the reality. Readers, meanwhile, are invited to question the people and places we base our security on, and to imagine what it would mean to forgive and forget and start living in a different way. Patchett is always so good on the psychology of complicated families, and her sharp prose never fails to hit the nail on the head. The Goldfinch comes to mind as a readalike – not least because of the significance of a piece of art: the cover depicts a painting made of Maeve when she was 10 – as well as Nick Hornby’s How to Be Good."
130,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5837456-susan,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is almost a modern day fairy tale. Cyril Conroy buys a house in Philadelphia, but it is not just any house. The Dutch House has a ballroom on the third floor, a swimming pool and too many stairs for a man with a bad leg. Conroy is a man obsessed with buildings; his wife, uncomfortable with the wealth – a woman who desires always to help the poor and referred to, more than once, as ‘a modern day saint’ – flees the house and leave behind her husband and children, Maeve and Danny.The novel is told through the point of view of Danny, for whom The Dutch House becomes the centre of his life and, later, the symbol of what he and Maeve has lost. For Cyril remarries the cold, calculating Andrea, who moves into the house with her two daughters. Soon, change comes to the house – Maeve is moved from her beloved room, with the window seat. Later, the two, find themselves outside the house and, as time moves backwards and forwards, they find themselves drawn back, again and again, to sit outside the house, contemplating their changed lives.This is a story about family and what that means. It is about the relationship between Danny and Maeve, and the stresses his relationship with his sister, later causes with his wife. It is about two wives; one who left a house, one who coveted it. Of course, it is about the house and what it comes to represent to those involved in it. An excellent novel and a good choice for reading groups, with much to discuss. "

Elna was repulsed by the huge house, the ostentatious furnishings left by the previous owners, and the necessity of hired help. She was a woman that needed to be needed—to give back to those less fortunate. Her children weren’t enough, so she ultimately left them and her husband.The second Mrs. Conroy loved the house and everything in the house—except her husband and the children from his first marriage. So, when Cyril passed away, she kicked out 15-year-old Danny and 22-year-old Maeve. Andrea also absconded with all of their inheritance except for an education fund for Danny. All they had left was each other!Patchett follows the brother/sister relationship for the next five decades. Maeve assumes the ‘mother’ role for her younger brother. Danny is a stubborn guy—often oblivious to his sister’s and wife’s needs. The rejection by their biological mother, and their step-mother haunted them for years. They often made pilgrimages to the Dutch House—the last place they knew their parents.Patchett’s ending seems disjointed from the rest of the novel. The author’s efforts to bring the story full-circle seemed ‘forced’. Never-the-less, the house represents greed, loss, sadness, and ultimately forgiveness.Recommend this well-written story. [Of note, Tom Hanks’ narration is superb.]"

I enjoyed Commonwealth, probably more than the Dutch House, because years later I can still recall the characters and that forbidden kiss that opens that novel. For me, there is less that is memorable about the Dutch House - but this is not to say it isn't equal in its ability to enmesh the reader fully in the story, which is altogether more disturbing and darkly themed. Twisting and turning across five decade, this is emotionally turbo charged family drama. Set around the odd but iconic ""Dutch House"", it is principally a story of two siblings, intrinsically linked by the pain and frought memories of their bleak childhood. It is about opportunities forgone, abandonment and reminiscence, but mostly, it is about reconcilliation. Patchett invites us to ponder, what we are prepared to live with and what we are prepared to forgive, and at what point do we walk away from those that continually hurt us? It reminded me of the Buddhist mantra, ""without forgiveness we have nothing..."" but what happens when in offering our forgiveness we are ultimately rejected? Patchett craftily weaves a story based on memory and forgiveness, where the characters (and the readers) are frequently faced with these questions - we may forgive what is done to us, but we will not forget it."

134,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1076079-karen,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5 starsThis is another of Patchett's books where you simply go along with the flow and gradually become deeply involved with the wonderful characters and their histories. Some may question what was the point of it, but like other Patchett books, she tells her story and you take from it what you will. Maybe it's about family connections, complications of divorce and step-parenting, or maybe it's about kindness and forgiveness. This one was entertaining, and I felt the house itself that lends its name to the title was not the main character, yet very much a part of it all. Certainly the straw that broke the camel's back, so to speak, in more than a few ways. I appreciated the relationship of Danny and his sister Maeve after their mother leaves them and their father remarries the wicked stepmother. It should give one incentive to have a will in place to protect the children of such a marriage, yet even that may not be enough. Thoughts on the audio version:Well, it was as if the male character Danny was written expressly for Tom Hanks to perform, that Ann Patchett had Hanks in mind the whole time. Sardonic reads sardonic well. Hanks does a super job with the story and added so much to my enjoyment of it. BTW, I understand that Tom and his wife Rita are friends of Ann.A couple of complaints, though. First he didn't even try to change his voice one iota to distinguish the guys from the girls, the men from the women. Everyone sounded the same... like Tom Hanks. It was confusing a few times, but really, not bad. Second, why do comedians have to try to make reading ""Part II, Chapter 8"" into something cute or funny? Ellen Degeneris did it in her Seriously book, and I hated it. Just read the frigging words already. Minor distractions, though. He did an awesome job with an awesome character. And... the fact that there was a Maeve and a May in the book does not work well in audio!"
135,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7481492-margitte,Rating 3 out of 5,"This novel is about a house and it's grandeur. The majestic old mansions was the product of the aesthetical work of the people who commissioned, built and turned it into a family home for people who cold afford the skilled work of masters at work.The original owners cherished it. The second owner, Cyril Conroy, a long-hours, extremely hard-working builder and developer himself, appreciated the house when he bought it, and wished for his family to live there happily ever after. However, it did not turn out that way. Somewhere along the way, greed, tragedy and disloyalty crept in and for over several generations the old mansions would watch them struggle with themselves and their feelings towards Cyril Conroy's legacy and the part they all played in their own destinies. I won't describe it as a modern fairytale at all. Nobody really lived happily ever after, despite the effort to write a villainous stepmother into the tale. Oh wait, no, it really might be the case. In postmodern idiom, everything is rewritten, and in this case being 'modern' and all, there dare not be a prince who rescues the princess and gallop away into the sunset. Nope, romance is frowned upon.Two dogs fight for a bone, and a third runs away with it: would you call that a modern fairytale? I would.WHY A LOWER RATING:I did not feel comfortable with the underlying plot winding through the story line. But overall I enjoyed this family saga up till the end of the second part. The third part: was it really necessary? It did not convince me of anything. In fact, I lost interest, scroll-read through it. Predictable. Boring. That's just me. Don't fret.Nevertheless, it is a wildly successful novel, one rating won't matter. It was written for another audience. And this author is really really good at her craft. "

140,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39878874-laura,Rating 1 out of 5,"This is the most BORING book I have ever read. And I'll happily read books that are just like ""British people visiting eachother and being polite"" for 600 pages. I especially love family epics with no plot. You'd think this would be perfect for me, but no. This was only 300odd pages and it was agonizing to get thru each page bc I did not give a fuck about a single character. I read this because my mom's neighbor gave it to us from the library, which meant I was on a deadline bc I don't want it to be late on her account. That lead to the feeling of school assignment which probably made me enjoy this less. She said the waiting list was over a thousand people long which is why she let us sneak it in before returning. I can't fathom why it's so popular! I don't really get the ann patchett hype but I'm by no means a hater. Bel Canto was fine, albeit overhyped. I remember enjoying Commonwealth even though my review is totally incomprehensible and I seem to have been having a mental breakdown while reading it. This on the other hand, was just unbelievably dull. the inside cover says ""t is filled with suspense"" BITCH WHERE! what suspense! ""Danny and Maeve will stay with you a long time"" the two most boring characters ever??????? I don't think so!!!! The dad was so boring. His only personality was buying out buildings in poor neighborhoods. Which like, whatever, I don't moralize too much about characters. I mean who doesn't like reading about immoral rich people antics. But this doesn't even have salaciousness or cruelty. The dad, and almost everyone else, was aggressively practical.  The housekeeper/cook/nanny were super nice but pretty much indistinguishable. Andrea was simply an evil stepmom with no complication, and I couldn't buy that her infatuation with the house was enough to convince the dad to marry her! The Med school trust fund scheme was dumb, because why waste a decade of life just as a fuck you that you don't even care about! And it definitely did not hurt Andrea & co financially! They waited too long to have any meaningful confrontation. Sure you can interpret their eventual meeting as ""old age robs us all! Time is its own revenge!"" but that was just so unsatisfying. The Evil Stepmom and the Bio mom's abandonment were the two confrontations/mysteries I'm waiting for the whole book and they were BOTH non starters. BOTH!!!!! Give us at least one! The narrator was the most boring and emotionless person of all. He was so boring that he dedicates a paragraph to talking about how much he likes the game monopoly, which is famous for being the most boring and greedy game ever! How apt. His kids were just place fillers. His wife was--you guessed it-- BORING! Her beef with Maeve was flimsy, idk I feel like in-law tension esp jealousy over close sibling relationships is super common and it was not explored in an interesting way. I know this is just a product of the times in which this book is set, but it was annoying how all the women's lives revolved around taking care of Danny, who was not even that appreciative or aware. I also can't get over the fact that his ONLY PASSION IN LIFE was buying out FORECLOSED BUILDINGS in Harlem. Then the whole Mother Abandonment. I have read a few books lately that have that plot element, and all of them answered my questions satisfactorily about why they left and why they didn't/couldn't try to contact their child later in life (Crawdads sing, Cutting for Stone). I know people leave their kids all the time and this happens in real life, but this was literally the dumbest reason. She felt so guilty about living in a big house she wanted to save the poor in India? Why wouldn't she leverage the considerable wealth she had access to via her husband and make a way bigger material impact rather than just being self serving? Swing Time by Zadie Smith does a MUCH better job of exploring the nuances of a parent-child relationship where the parent cares deeply about improving society at the expense of her family life. She fuckin left completely and then not even ONCE over 50 years try to contact them?? wtf??? and then the reunion was just so anticlimactic!! And don't even get me started on the fact that she starts being Evil Andrea's caretaker! The disrespect.Seriously what am I missing here that everyone loves. I guess I'll find out when I read the reviews. I liked the descriptions of the house, which were so much more vivid than any of the humans living in it. But as much as I enjoyed the sense of place the house had, I still could not muster up a fuck to give about Danny and Maeve's and everyone else's obsession with it. I also liked that the cover was the exact painting in the story, bc I hate when book covers have absolutely nothing to do with the content. Anyway yea I was bored to tears by the characters relationships to eachother. Their motivations and reactions were deeply unsatisfying. And if this book was trying to make points on class it was not doing so very well. I'm glad it's over!"

The Dutch House, as it came to be known in Elkins Park and Jenkintown and Glenside and all the way to Philadelphia, referred not to the house's architecture but to its inhabitants. The Dutch House was the place where those Dutch people with the unpronounceable name lived. Seen from certain vantage points of distance, it appeared to float several inches above the hill it sat on. The panes of glass that surrounded the glass front doors were as big as storefront windows and held in place by wrought-iron vines. The windows both took in the sun and reflected it back across the wide lawn. Maybe it was neoclassical, though with with a simplicity in the lines that came closer to Mediterranean or French, and while it was not Dutch, the blue delft mantels in the drawing room, library, and master bedroom were said to have been pried out of a castle in Utrecht and sold to the VanHoebeeks to pay a prince's gambling debts.
When I was a young mother, my parents completed the construction of their dream house, two thousand kilometres away from me and my brothers (and my kids) and they took early retirement and moved away. Over the years and as our families grew, if me and my brothers wanted our parents to know their grandkids, we would need to make the long drive to their home by the lake and thus spend every summer vacation. Inevitably, every year, at some point when everyone's kids had been tucked into their beds, my brothers and I, sitting around the campfire and a few beers in, would start to complain about the kind of parents we had had; let's just say that it wasn't totally surprising for them to have been able to leave us as they did. And one year at the campfire – I don't even remember which one of them said it – one of our spouses griped, “Here we go, the Jones kids unearthing their miserable childhood again.” And that was fair, but we couldn't stop ourselves – I know that for me, everything I had ever felt about our parents had become tied up with that faraway house by the lake and I, year after year, resented being there and it brought up everything long-buried all over again. And so it goes in Ann Patchett's The Dutch House: Having been raised in a uniquely opulent house, siblings Danny and Maeve Conroy so identify the Dutch House with their parents (and their parents' individual relationships with the house) that every time they get together in their hometown the pair inevitably drives to their old neighbourhood and park outside their former home in order to rehash the past and try to figure out the puzzle that was their parents. This is a family drama and a finely observed character study, and although some surprising events do occur, I was mostly surprised by the very human (often conflicting) ways that Patchett has her characters react to these events. I loved every bit of this and will make this review spoiler-free. (Note: I read an ARC and passages quoted may not be in their final forms.)
“Jesus,” Celeste said later when I was trying to tell her the story. “It's like you're Hansel and Gretel. You just keep walking through the dark woods holding hands no matter how old you get. Do you ever get tired of reminiscing?”
The Dutch House is narrated by Danny over the span of fifty years, moving backwards and forwards through time. I liked that this was told only from Danny's POV: as a much younger sibling, he had always been protected by his sister, and maybe it was because he was sheltered or maybe it was because he was a boy, but he had been so incurious about his parents as people when he was growing up that he learns many things late in life and these details become surprising to the reader as well (although they had always been known to Maeve, Danny only needed to ask). In a way, each of the siblings grows up to be like their parents (Maeve big-hearted and charitable like their mother, Danny acquisitive and emotionally walled-off like their dad) even if they don't recognise it, and although Maeve eventually learns to let go of her resentments, Danny nurtures his and refuses to forgive (and again, it's interesting to wonder whether that's because of his sheltered upbringing or intrinsic to his nature). 
We overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we're not seeing it as the people we were, we're seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered. 
Much that's magical about this book lies in the nature of memory and knowing and acceptance. Many parts made me smile and a couple of parts brought me to tears; I recognised myself in these pages and I enjoyed the whole thing."
142,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7115890-constantine,Rating 4 out of 5,"Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐Genre: Literary Fiction + Historical FictionAs the title suggests, this is the story of the residents of the Dutch House. A father and his two children are living in this house. After his wife left him and his two children, Cyril marries Andrea. This stepmother kicks both Danny and Maeve out of the house when their father passes away. The story is about these two siblings and how they survive life’s difficulties. It spans around five decades and is told from Danny’s perspective. I’m always fond of stories that revolve around dysfunctional families. Although the dysfunctionality, in this case, was not too obvious it still was appealing enough for my taste. I think the author did a great job with the characters. They are varied and have their own personality. The relationships between these characters are well thought out. The fascinating thing is that the Dutch House itself plays like a subtle character in the background along with all the human characters.This is the first book I read by Ann Patchett and I’m genuinely pleased by her writing and storytelling techniques. However, I don’t feel this book will be a cup of tea for everybody. I consider myself as one of the target readers for whom this book was written. The story is complex and thought-provoking which makes it captivating. I will be looking forward to reading more of Patchett’s work in the future. "

145,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18695911-daniel-chaikin,Rating 5 out of 5,"I find this one a tough book to review because while there is a plot and one some people will find of interest, it hardly captures what this book really is. It's a novel about place, a house in all its history and architectural oddity, and one bitterly stolen too. And a book about a life, a younger brother telling his own life, growing up without his mother and losing his father to a heart attack, but really he is writing about his older sister. It's, in a way, a love letter to that strong-willed sister who somehow filled-in as a mother figure. This is a nice story, but it's not what makes this book so special to me. But how to capture what does?This is my fourth Patchett book, 3rd novel and I've learned to appreciate her effortless clean prose that carries a story largely by filling in all the stuff that isn't happening with some self-driven thought space and with atmosphere. Here it feels like someone on role, it's a very natural feeling book. As best I can see it, Patchett has captured a pacing, one that takes its time, builds room for space and time, that can bring that reader into that moment without any need to carry on. She brings in some detail that would grab my attention...not my interest exactly, but my attention, I'm listening and I'm wanting to know more about then, and there. And then within that set-up our narrator, Danny, tells his bittersweet story of a normal life with some striking odd scars, like a missing mother and a lost house, one he and his sister miss so much that they spend time together in a car on the curb outside the house they don't live in or own. There is another element here of the author of The Patron Saint of Liars (a book i haven't read). Patchett seems to thinking hard about sainthood, as in the Catholic tradition, or really all traditions. Danny, and his sister Maeve have a living mother they don't know, and they keep being told she is a saint. How can a saint leave their family? But, flipping through the imaginary pages of history, what saint hasn't abandoned their family? It's a curious thing that comes in the novel as a late addition that makes you realize afterward it was there, as a theme, throughout the entirety of the novel. Sainthood, self-sacrifice, selfish sacrifice. Does selflessness always come with a self-interest? And it makes for some interesting comparisons and contrasts, especially between mother and daughter - the daughter whose life defines the book that maybe isn't about a house.Anyway, that last paragraph is idle thought. I enjoyed this book a great deal because of the storytelling and how I was always involved and because of how much I looked forward to listening to more of it. And it doesn't hurt that Tom Hanks reads on audio, and becomes over the course of the book the only voice Danny could possibly have. I do recommend this one to anyone interested. -----------------------------------------------27.

Слушах автобиографична книга на авторката (прочетена от самата нея) и историята за трудния и професионален път, докато дойде времето, в което труда и да бъде признат страшно ме заинтригува и от там се породи интереса ми към книгата. Пробвах се да я слушам в storytel и колкото и възхитително да четеше Том Ханкс, на 5тата минута знаех, че това е книга, която искам да изживея четейки я. Определено мога да кажа, че си струваше чакането! Книгата е великолепна и ме впечатли изключително много. Сигурна съм, че ще е сред любимите ми книги за 2021 и не само.Семейна сага от най-любимите ми - сложни психологически взаимоотношения между родители и деца и брат и сестра. В центъра на историята са Дани и Мейв, които живеят във внушителната Холандска къща близо до Филаделфия. Загубата на майка им като деца, вторият брак на баща им и прогонването им от дома им от “мащехата” им завинаги белязва живота им. Повече няма да разказвам, защото без да искам ще има много спойлери.Най-уникалното за мен в книгата е психологическата, дълбока свързаност между Дани и Мейв и образа на Холандската Къща, която е цял един герой в историята. Както и образа и ролята на майка им. Оставям един цитат, който ме накара да настръхна:“Бяхме превърнали нещастието си във фетиш, бяхме се влюбили в него. Гадеше ми се, защото си дадох сметка колко дълго сме поддържали това си състояние, а не защото сме решили да сложим край.”"

148,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15265939-lynn,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5 stars.I’m not sure where to begin with this book. It is so complex on many levels. Told from Danny Conroy’s POV, it is the story about how the acquisition, and eventual loss of the mansion known as The Dutch House, has a disastrous effect on the Conroy family. Purchased by his father Cyril as a surprise for his mother Elna, the house becomes a fixture and fixation in all their lives. Elna can’t stand living there, and eventually leaves her husband and two children, including Danny’s older sister Maeve, and disappears from their lives. Cyril, an emotionally closed off father, eventually remarries a woman, Andrea, who only cares about the house, and nothing and no one else. After Cyril’s untimely death, Andrea banishes Danny and Maeve from the house. Maeve takes it upon herself to make sure Danny gets a good start in life, while trying to screw over Andrea. At times, Maeve and Danny park outside the house and ruminate on their lives, trying to make sense of it all. For most of their adult lives, it’s Maeve and Danny against the world. Even Danny’s wife, Celeste, cannot infiltrate their bond, much to her frustration. Eventually secrets are revealed, pasts are reconciled and forgiveness is offered and accepted. This story takes place over 50 years, with some characters giving the backstory which explains the present. The story sometimes jumps around in time, but the reader generally knows where they are in the story. The characters are wonderfully portrayed, although not all are likable. Danny and Maeve are totally human and are shown for who they truly are, warts and all. Danny doesn’t realize how much like his father he is as a person, although he is a better father to his kids than his father was to him and Maeve. Maeve is a joy to read. She never pulls any punches with anyone. I have to say I really disliked Andrea, who is almost too easy to hate, and Celeste, who had one expectation of her life and became bitter when it didn’t happen as she wanted. Frankly, I couldn’t understand why Danny married her, other than it seemed convenient at the time. I never got the impression that they really loved each other. Fluffy, Jocelyn and Sandy remind me of the three fairy godmothers in Cinderella, always showing up at the right times and waving their magic wands to try to make things right. The story explores the themes of forgiveness, obsession, family love, self sufficiency and self actualization. Both Danny and Elna had to be true to themselves in order to live their lives. Both were also quite self absorbed, seldom seeing beyond their own needs. Maeve’s only purpose in life seemed to be to help Danny, although she did find her own niche and was seemingly happy. I sometimes wondered about her relationship with her boss, if maybe there was more there than Danny knew. The book is beautifully written and flows along almost seamlessly. Mostly it is well paced, although the last section seemed to be a bit rushed. But overall, this is a great read that I could not put down. A definite recommend. "
149,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83419690,Rating 5 out of 5,"Ann Patchett is one of those few. who can bring banal everyday life to the meta-level. He draws the heavy dark water from the wells of the collective unconscious, after drinking it, everyone becomes a part of history himself, and brings a piece of himself into it. What has entered into flesh and blood is already your pain and joy forever. However, this immersion is far from pathos and seems to be intentionally devoid of clear links to the political situation of ""the fate of the family in the fate of the country"", previously mandatory for the genre of family saga. Patchett's stories remain private, even with the case of the extremely social ""Bel Canto"".""Dutch House"" is about the nouveau riche who moved into a beautiful three-story house bought by his father with all possessions. The story is about how the mother did not like this mansion and left it, and the second wife drove the children out of there. About how the fates of the brother and sister developed further, how, without being dazzlingly lucky and cloudlessly happy, both managed to live their lives with dignity and in harmony with the world. And the evil stepmother lived her life with less dignity, but surrounded by beautiful expensive things in the palace, which, unlike the mother of the heroes, she loved immediately and for life. More of a spouse, more of her own daughters and her immortal soul.Потерянный рай или Дом, где разбиваются сердца?Мне казалось, что дом - огромная раковина, которую я обречен таскать на себе всю жизнь.Энн Пэтчетт из тех немногих. кто может вывести банальную повседневность на метауровень. Черпает тяжелую темную воду колодцев коллективного бессознательного, испив которой, всякий становится частью истории сам, и вносит в нее частичку себя. Что вошло в плоть и кровь, то уже навеки твоя боль и радость. Однако, погружение это далеко от пафоса и словно бы намерено лишено четких привязок к политической ситуации ""судьбы семьи в судьбе страны"", прежде обязательной для жанра семейной саги. Истории Пэтчетт остаются частными, даже с случае предельно социального ""Бельканто"".""Голландский дом"" о нуворишах, вселившихся в прекрасный трехэтажный дом, купленный отцом со всем имуществом. История о том, как мать не полюбила этот особняк и ушла из него, а вторая жена выгнала оттуда детей. О том, как складывались судьбы брата и сестры дальше, как, не будучи ослепительно удачливыми и безоблачно счастливыми, оба сумели прожить свою жизнь достойно и в гармонии с миром. А злая мачеха прожила свою менее достойно, но в окружении прекрасных дорогих вещей во дворце, который, в отличие от мамы героев, полюбила сразу и на всю жизнь. Больше супруга, больше собственных дочерей и своей бессмертной души.Ну какая же это банальность: жена уходит от богатого любимого мужа, оставив десятилетнюю дочь и четырехлетнего сына. Не к любовнику, заметьте, а вообще непонятно почему. Отец женится снова на красавице с двумя дочерьми, младше наших героев. Мачеха понемногу прибирает к рукам все в доме, оттесняя родных детей от жизненных благ, а после смерти мужа и вовсе выгоняет их из дома. Много вы такого видали? А то нет? Половина сказок об этом, ""Крошечка-Хаврошечка"", ""Золушка"", ""О мертвой царевне и семи богатырях"", ""Гензель и Гретель"". Мамы в них не уходят, а умирают, а так все то же.Дальше: сестра отдает все силы на то, чтобы спасти брата - ""Гуси-лебеди"", ""Снежная Королева"". Забота о его образовании остается за рамками большинства сказок, в пользу принцев-изгнанников, как правило, не учреждают образовательных фондов. Ну так ведь и у нас не сказка, а реальная жизнь, в которой фонд играет ту самую роль, какую добрая коровушка или фея-крестная - то, что позволяет не сгинуть в самом начале, хотя дальнейшее зависит только от тебя. Даже сказочные условия, вроде ""никто не должен знать"" и ""вернуться до полуночи"" соблюдены. В нашем случае, это: ""утратишь право пользоваться, если успеваемость снизится до троек"".Жесткое условия. Особенно когда чувствуешь призвание не к медицине, которая даст самую престижную из профессий, а к куда менее почтенным спекуляциям недвижимостью, для которых учиться не нужно. Но разве у мамы не та же самая история? Она тоже всего-то и хотела, что помогать бедным, вместо того, чтобы жить не своей жизнью в этом барском доме. ""Голландский дом"" - это еще и о том, как мы проецируем свое понятие счастья на других, как искренне дивимся, отчего лучшая, в нашем понимании, доля, которую дарим ближним, воспринимается веригами и кандаламы.И о том, как по-разному подходим к принятию судьбоносных решений, с какой готовностью порой приносим в жертву ближних ради дальних. И о том, как наступать на горло собственной песне, как выдерживать годы занятий нелюбимым и не своим делом. Как честно отработанная карма позволяет наконец обрести счастье со своим и любимым.Энн Пэтчетт, безусловно, мастер, у которого a финальные прощения-примирения не выглядят патокой (ну, почти не выглядят). А ""Голландский дом"" одна из лучших переводных книг 2021 в российском книжном пространстве."

I was afraid it might drive me to a slump because it said somewhere that it was a slow narrative, but a perfect one, so I could only think about going back to the book. I fell in love with the siblings' bond and never looked back. This is not just a book about a family house, it is so much more."
151,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7912849-kerrin,Rating 4 out of 5,"This was a very complex, interesting saga about a sister and brother, Maeve and Danny Conroy. Danny is the narrator. (Everyone who has listened to Tom Hanks read the Audible version rants how wonderful he is as Danny.) When Maeve was a little girl, their father Cyril bought a mansion known as the Dutch House. Their mother, Elna, who had wanted to become a nun, never felt comfortable in the house. When Danny was a small child, Elna abandoned the family and went off to “be a saint” by helping the poor.Soon thereafter, Maeve becomes a Type I diabetic. The children are cared for by the household staff after their mother disappears. Cyril later marries Andrea, a truly horrible woman, with two young daughters. Cyril shared his love of real estate and owning buildings with Danny. Cyril dies unexpectedly while Danny is only a Sophmore in high school. Andrea kicks him out of the house and demands that Maeve, who recently graduated from college, become his caregiver.Danny’s devotion to Maeve is very deep throughout the novel. For example, Danny wants to follow in Cyril’s footsteps and become a real estate maven, but he goes to medical school just to please her. Maeve never marries, and never seems to fully live up to her potential.For many years, Maeve and Danny would park across the street from The Dutch House and have meaningful discussions. When they are much older, they realize they “had made a fetish out of [their] misfortune, fallen in love with it.” They both had a powerful attachment to painful experiences and relationships of their childhood. It was more difficult for Danny to be “dislodged from suffering” and become unstuck from the past than it was for Maeve. When it came to forgiving their mother, Danny only did so to make Maeve happy.My biggest complaint about this book was the lack of continuity in the timeline. Danny could be talking about his two children, then next about when he was dating his wife, followed by coming home from boarding school in high school. While many others have praised Ann Patchett for being able to craft together a jigsaw puzzle, I found the style a little annoying. For that reason, I rate it 4-Stars."
152,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1903072-peter-boyle,Rating 3 out of 5,"Cyril Conroy, a real estate developer, secretly purchases a striking three-storey mansion on the outskirts of Philadelphia. When he presents it to his wife Elna, she is appalled by its opulence. It gets to a point where she can't stand to live there any longer and she runs away to help the poor, leaving 10 year-old Maeve and toddler Danny behind. Some time after, Cyril marries a woman named Andrea, who already has two young daughters. Andrea's arrival brings major upheaval to the Conroy household. The story is narrated by Danny years later, looking back on a time when he and his sister had their lives upended, reminiscing about the ways he and Maeve coped with their misfortune.This is my first time reading Ann Patchett and I can see why she has so many admirers. She is clearly a keen observer of human nature. Her writing style is unhurried, always in complete control. My one complaint here is that not all the characters are fully developed - Andrea in particular felt like a two-dimensional villain. But I suppose that can happen when you use a first-person narrative - it's Danny's version of events that we are told. I liked how the story explored how a person can become preoccupied with the past. And I was moved by the sibling bond between Maeve and Danny, the sacrifices they made for one another, the heartbreak they shared that drove them closer together. An absorbing and poignant family drama."
153,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50297885-joy-d,Rating 4 out of 5,"“We had made a fetish out of our misfortune, fallen in love with it.” ― Ann Patchett, The Dutch HouseQuiet character-driven novel about siblings Maeve and Danny Conroy, whose mother left home when they were children. Set in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania, their father is reserved, and their stepmother despises them. They go through rough times, experiencing the ups and downs of life over the course of fifty years. They rely heavily on each other. They constantly revisit their past, repeating destructive patterns, making it difficult to live a fulfilled life. The story is told from Danny’s adult perspective. It explores the childhood trauma of abandonment, how memories get tangled over time, and how acting on a sense of obligation or duty can change a life. There is a subplot related to materialism. Some characters chase money or status, and these are contrasted against altruism and a desire to minister to the poor. The writing is elegant. The characters feel authentic. The house is a recurring image throughout the book. I listened to the audio book, read by Tom Hanks. He is a fantastic reader. His phrasing patterns are unique, and it flows well. I am rapidly becoming a fan of Ann Patchett. This is the third of her novels I have read – the others are Bel Canto and State of Wonder. I very much enjoyed all three. "

There are so many brilliant 5 stars.Unfortunately, although beautifully written, I did not feel engaged.It started very promising, but the plotless storyline dragged for too long.I don’t mind a plotless story, as long as the characters are giving me back something.I found that the characters were all too passive, flat and unreal. Even some situations sounded unrealistic.I also did not like the timeline structure. Oh, wait, there is no timeline. In one paragraph you are all of sudden married and with two kids, next paragraph you are back to your younger age and trying to figure out what you want in life; in another paragraph you are destitute and on the following you are buying properties.I found the whole book uninteresting and boring.I even tried listening to the audiobook as I read, and Tom Hanks, as a narrator, did not help to hold my interest.I love a good family drama where there are no forgiveness.I really did not care for any of the characters.This book was too bloodless.It left me cold.Oh, yes, this book is considered as a modern fairy tale.

160,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18868296-albert,Rating 4 out of 5,"I think I will always like Ann Patchett’s prose, her characters and her stories. The passage of time will not change that, nor will the type of story she is telling. There is always tremendous detail to her characters and the time and place of which she is writing. I feel like I am in the hands of a talented and experienced storyteller. There are always characters I like or aspects that I like of characters that I don’t really like. In The Dutch House the notes of love, the desire to belong and forgiveness are so strong and yet so intricately woven into the story that I never felt Patchett had to repeat or dwell upon her message. Danny and Maeve’s father buys their mother, Ulna, a beautiful, unique house as a surprise. Danny and Maeve love the house, but their mother is never comfortable there. My favorite character in the novel is Maeve. She was intelligent, independent, forthright, passionate and yet intensely protective and supportive of her brother, Danny. The house, itself a character, provided stability that Danny and Maeve did not get from their parents. As adults we often find various pursuits that drain energy away from our commitment to our children. So was the case with Maeve and Danny’s mother and father. Will we see our errors before it is too late, or will we spend the latter parts of our lives regretting our mistakes? Will we just continue repeating our mistakes or those of our parents, whether recognizing or ignorant of what we are doing? "
161,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/115229580-justin-chen,Rating 5 out of 5,"5 starsA solid 4 stars story with an added star for Tom Hanks' vibrant narration, which really should be the definitive way to consume The Dutch House. This is a sentimental story masterfully told: a cross-generational tale revolving around a brother and sister, their decades long relationship with each other, as well as their strange obsession for their childhood home. Ann Patchett managed to weave a complex familial drama without swerving into sappy generic territory, instead focusing on deconstructing the lifelong implication of reckless, in-the-moment decisions, with a flair for levity and sarcasm.The nonlinear structure is a surprising choice for a story that's typically told either chronologically, or through a series of flashbacks. The added complexity definitely enhances the overall experience, like a half-finished puzzle, the reader gets to experience alongside its characters, overlaying the past with the present, and decipher how their previous decisions impact the future. The Dutch House is a novel of typical length, yet emotionally it feels like an epic, due to its extended timeline (covering at least 50+ years) as well as the frank depiction of the protagonist's family dynamics. Filled with observational charm, The Dutch House elegantly captures the lasting effect of one's upbringing; this is an easy recommendation."
162,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34980639-april,Rating 1 out of 5,"I feel like this book will likely be lauded as ""good literature"". It will likely be something that people who read really important books will talk about for the next few years. But, it was not a book I enjoyed. I heard Ann Patchett speak over the summer, and she mentioned that Tom Hanks would be narrating this audiobook. Since, I love Tom Hanks, I decided to give it a listen, even though I also received a free ARC of the book during Ann's talk. Not even Tom Hanks could save my interest in this book. I kept listening really hoping at some point I would begin to enjoy it, but I never did. The book skips around a lot, and that didn't translate well to audio. I was confused as to when certain things were taking place. I assume I am supposed to cheer for Danny and Maeve, because they are abandoned by their mother and then kicked out of their home by their stepmother when their father dies, but I don't. I don't care about them, or their obsession with the house they grew up in. I just don't get the appeal of this book. This was the first book of Patchett's I've read, and I am definitely not inspired to read anymore. However, I will say that hearing her speak was fantastic. She's witty and charming. Too bad she doesn't write that way."

Though this was not what I was expecting, I did find myself thinking about it. This is at its heart a family drama that revolves around a house. Honestly, the house was a more interesting character than either Danny or Mauve. I kind of wish the POV had alternated between them both instead of only Danny. Think it would’ve added an interesting perspective and more depth to the story. I listened to this and realized it was being narrated by Tom Hanks. Wasn’t sure how I’d like him but he slowly grew on me. I spend it up a bit from my usual 1.25 up to 1.35. In the end, this novel struck a cord in me and for this reason the added star is deserved."

I became a fan for life, reading every one of her marvelous (and unique!) novels. So yes, I was primed to love “The Dutch House”, and I did! Not just because it’s my habit to rave about Patchett’s novels, but because it’s GREAT; it’s my new favorite!“The Dutch House”, (itself as much a character as any of the humans in the novel) is in a suburb of Philadelphia. Just after WWII, Cyril Conroy buys the palatial mansion – fully and sumptuously furnished – for his wife Elna and it is where Danny and Maeve Conroy grew up. Danny is our first-person narrator and he and Maeve are a modern day Hansel and Gretel, complete with abandonment, banishment and a wicked step-mother. They even have three Fairy Godmothers: Fluffy, Sandy, and Jocelyn. “The Dutch House” is the story of a “modern family”, as this was the era when families started to become fractured and step-parents and step-siblings became more prevalent. Some of these themes Patchett explored beautifully in “Commonwealth”, and she knows whereof she speaks because she’s written essays about her own large, extended, loosely related-by-a-string, family. I was absorbed from page one, and I hated to turn the last page. What makes Patchett so accessible and relevant is her beautiful writing, her wit, and the fascinating stories she spins out of every-day life. At the most surprising, dramatic, and climactic scene in the novel Danny narrates: “I had not been born with an imagination large enough to encompass this moment.” Well, Ann Patchett was born with an imagination large enough – thank heavens! What a magnificent story!"
167,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8530205-marty-fried,Rating 4 out of 5,"Tom Hanks seemed perfect for narrating this book. His voice made it easier to keep going when the going got slow, which it did off and on. While it won't win any awards for action and intrigue, like going to school, it does award the reader for being there and paying attention.It was occasionally hard to follow because it suddenly skipped around in time, but not for long. Perhaps that was just a way to make us pay attention, by jolting us awake now and then.Some of the lessons I learned were family is important so don't shut any of them out, and don't hold a grudge and try to get even with someone who you don't really even know. Even though their mother abandoned them when they were young, I think she deserves forgiveness more than the father, who didn't really seem to care about his children very much. And the evil stepmother probably didn't deserve to be hated, especially to the point of abandoning her children as part of the family, or as friends. They were victims as much as anyone.Personally, I liked the father least, but he tried to do what he thought was good. Unfortunately, the house seemed to have evil intent or something. It was too strong for its occupants, and perhaps their mother sensed it more than others. It certainly seemed to have a bad influence on many lives.All in all, a very good book, but a little slow for me at this time, hence the 4 stars."

A história foi muito bem escrita e a autora demonstra uma facilidade muito grande em transitar entre as cinco décadas de vida desses personagens. Todas as discussões propostas aqui foram desenvolvidas lindamente. Estive, o tempo inteiro, muito interessado em tudo que acontecia na vida desses personagens e onde a autora levaria eles ao longo dessas cinco décadas. Esse é mais um livro que vai discutir família e dinâmica familiar e, pra ser honesto, é muito difícil eu não gostar de um livro que propõe essa discussão, que mostra as diversas facetas de uma família e que mostra como a família tem o poder de moldar um indivíduo pra sempre. Com isso, a narrativa explora a história daqueles que escolheram o passado como presente, daqueles que não conseguem seguir em frente e viver sua vida, propondo, indiretamente, uma reflexão sobre o que aconteceria se tudo o que aconteceu na vida daquelas pessoas fosse deixado no passado. O livro foi lindo, inteligente, esclarecedor. Recomendo!Gostaria de fazer uma observação: o audiobook desse livro é muito bom, quem puder ler junto com o audiobook vai ter toda uma experiência."

All book is told from son’s perspective throughout his life. Mother hates the house, so just abandons her family and disappears. Why? What reason? Any depth, no. Nothing. Dad gets a new young wife and dies very soon. So 2 kids, now students live with their stepmom until she just throws them out as it is her property. That’s basically it.Sister and brother has very codependent relationship and every month sits in the car and watch the house. It is obvious that it is a modern Hansel and Gretel story, but do you really need to spell it out and chew everything? It is even mentioned in a book, that they are like Hansel and Gretel.After 30 years mothers appears. With no explanation, nothing. That was the most undeveloped and unreasonable character. No reason for leaving no reason for coming backs and no reason for behaving like she did in the end, which I am not gonna spoil. Everyone gets their punishment in a way. Idea is not bad, it could of been very good book with nice characters study, but now it is just boring blah blah blah I will forget it in a week. ‘Abandoning your children to go to help the poor of India means you’re a narcissist who wants the adoration of strangers’ 2* for nice cover and idea"

What I kept coming back to in this book was Danny and Maeve’s closeness, their bond, how they raise each other. Danny and Maeve’s childhood is filled with disappointment, but the love they find in each other is beautiful and hopeful. I thought it was a beautiful story of a relationship between brother and sister. "

172,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2228181-jill,Rating 4 out of 5,"According to the book jacket of The Dutch House, the novel is a “dark fairy tale about two smart people who cannot overcome their past.”And indeed, the two main characters – the supremely self-confident and protective older sister Maeve and her younger brother, Danny – are obsessively connected to the lavish estate purchased by their father in the Philadelphia suburbs. Their mother has left them to their own wiles and in her place, a younger wicked stepmother and her own two daughters have moved in with their father. It is only a matter of time until they are exiled. And although they follow different paths, it is only when they come together that they are complete.I had a little trouble tapping into the male voice of Danny at first (for several pages, I thought the first-person narrator was female), but gradually, I accepted his voice because I was caught up in the narrative. Ann Patchett is a natural-born storyteller and here, like in her last book, Commonwealth, she ambitiously traces a family through a couple of generations.Both books center around an action (the exile in Dutch House, an illicit kiss in Commonwealth), and both deal with “blended families” that in reality do not blend. At the time Commonwealth was published, Ann Patchett called it her “autobiographical first novel” and I suspect that some of Dutch House is mined from those same murky areas of childhood – the complications of extended families, the theft of certain memories of childhood, the borders between realities and how we remember.It’s difficult to review the way I want to without spoilers, so I’ll just say this: I also saw parallels to religious parables. In a sense, the Dutch House is Eden – that wonderful paradise of childhood of which teens and young adults are eventually cast out. There is a central character who sets herself up to be a saint with an aberrant desire to be “of help”, and Ann Patchett nails it when she says that saints are generally despised by those who really know them. And, there is a quest for redemption.Although I have quibbles – the male voice, the somewhat rushed ending (along with certain aspects of that ending), I do think this is one of Ann Patchett’s better books. It’s not quite as good as Bel Canto (which, to my mind, is her best) nor is it as unrealistic as State of Wonder (which many readers enjoyed and I did not). It��s definitely worth reading and I give it a 4.5 rating."
173,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2330809-steve,Rating 4 out of 5,"This was very (indeed, extremely) good, but, as much as I enjoyed it, well, it's just not one of my favorite Patchett books. That's a high bar ... and (alas), maybe my expectations were too high, but ... given how much I've enjoyed some of her work, I just can't put this one in the same category.But it's classic Patchett. Easy (and a pleasure) to read. Convincing characters that play their roles well. A complex ... and not entirely predictable (and peppered with sufficient twists and turns) ... drama spanning a lifetime ... all packaged nicely with efficient, appropriate, appealing prose. Family ... and relationships ... and love ... and loss and disappointment ... and more than a dollop of bitterness and spite ... and life ... and loyalty ... and expectation ... and, in the end, ultimately, the human condition.I'm somewhat intrigued by Patchett's decision to narrate through a male voice, but ... it worked (at least for me) and made sense, in context, given the way the story played out.I'm pleased I read it (and spent my money on it - Patchett has earned my reading dollars many times over), and I'm glad I got to it relatively quickly before I became biased by others' perspectives. And, in retrospect, if I hadn't read (and loved) so much of her other stuff, I almost certainly would've rated this one 5 stars...."

No twists and turns that keep you up thinking about them but people that you keep thinking about because you feel like you know them. Tom Hanks is the narrator for the audible book (totally recommend) and you truly feel like he is telling his story. You believe this story and the relationship with him and his family especially his sister. You go through loss, anger, shock, grief, forgiveness, love, parenthood and many other emotions with this story but all the while enjoying this, well at least I did. I would absolutely recommend this book to friends but can't give any defining moments, just that when you are done....you will miss them.A re-read for me. I just love this book, actually a re - listen. One of the best audiobooks that I own.I wish Tom Hanks would narrate more books."

Fixated by the house, they revisit it through the years, and so the past and how it shapes present and future is examined. And later forgiveness, justice and penance.I think the writer is a marvelous storyteller, I went on reading even at times sheer stubbornness being the primary motivator. The sole reason to finish the book being to find out how it all ends. I'm not so sure if I liked the journey or what we find in the end. I think it all comes down to distrust. Life makes it allowances, I admit, but nothing is ever as simple or neat and cleanly cut as the way a lot of things seem here."

But the Dutch House checks all the boxes for what I consider a great book. Characters that you want to hug, slap, or invite over for dinner. Or all of the above. A story about a family and a house that demonstrates how that house can be so much more than a structure. It can represent the bones of the family, a symbol connected to love or loss or achievement or abandonment. And a bringing together of people who were flung away and then return to the fold, for comfort, understanding, closure. What a pleasure to read."

Thanks for the opportunity to read this marvellous book.
178,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35482263-gumble-s-yard---golden-reviewer,Rating 4 out of 5,"I read this book due to its longlisting for the 2020 Women’s Prize.The book is narrated in the first person by Danny Conroy. He largely grew up in a household with his property developer Father, his 7 year older sister Maeve and two servants, his mother having left, for India, when he was young. They lived in an ostentatious house in a Pennsylvania town, something she never reconciled herself to, given her altruistic/charitable mindset. The house was originally commissioned by a Dutch family who made a fortune in cigarettes after the First World War. When their family all died out, and the house fell into disrepair looked after by Fiona (the daughter of their driver and cook) before being purchased by Danny’s father shortly after the Second World War (using money he had secretly amassed in some speculative but informed property deals). Danny’s parents took on Fiona as a nurse for Maeve and the soon-to-be-born Danny. Fiona left when Danny was young (not before an affair with their father) after striking and injuring Danny with a spoon one day.The book opens with Danny remembering the day his Father bought home another divorcee – Andrea (to whom Maeve in particular took an immediate dislike), later followed by introducing Andrea’s two children, with marriage and further alienation from Maeve then following. When their father dies of a heart attack, and Andrea is almost the last to know, Danny now 15 and Maeve (working as an accountant in a local frozen vegetable manufacturing firm, a job Danny considers beneath her) realise they have effectively lost both the house and their role in continuing their father’s business (something Danny had set his heart on) – as Andrea had persuaded their father not only to give her joint ownership but also not to write a will – their only provision an educational trust fund for Danny and Andrea’s two children. Danny ends up at boarding school and then expensive medical school, at Maeve’s insistence as a way to spend as much of the fund as possible, his own dreams of property speculation and development deferred.The book, narrated in the first person by Danny, jumps around time (although with a largely forward impetus). Danny marries and his wife Celeste (who largely builds her life around caring for him) and Maeve grow to dislike each other over time – so that he effectively meets them both separately, although there is a warmer relationship (and physical relationship) between Maeve and his daughter (an ambitious dancer turned singer turned actress).Maeve remains obsessed with her hatred and resentment of Andrea – and frequently, over many years, she and Danny wait in a car looking at the house – in fact much of their relationship is forged during those times, as Danny finally realises (many many years after Celeste and around 250 pages after the reader) “We had made a fetish out of our misfortunes, fallen in love with it”.
“Like swallows, like salmon, we were the helpless captives of our migratory patterns. We pretended that what we had lost was the house, not our mother, not our father. We pretended that what we had lost had been taken from us by the person who still lived inside”
Although narrated by Danny and (in its final incarnation) named after the house, the book is really about neither. The real key character at the centre of the book is Maeve (and I believe that was the author’s preferred title, “The Dutch House” being picked more for commercial reasons, that the author, as a bookshop owner, could appreciate). It makes sense that a picture of Maeve, which is important to the book, is on the front cover, rather than the house. The author has also said that this was deliberate (and the description of the house in the book is left limited) as the author really wants readers to think of a house that they have seen.Maeve herself is a complex character. A life-long sufferer from diabetes, but with a partly reckless attitude to her own health. Having to witness her mother leaving home (without perhaps ever really understanding why at the time). Her own attempts to stand on her own two feet (by forging her own career rather than taking money from her father) are simply ignored by him (he is too busy involving Danny in his business). Her father’s relationship with Andrea is just for her another rejection. She never comes to terms either with Andrea being worth to marry her father (something Andrea’s behaviour hardly disabuses her of) and then later that Celeste is worth to marry Danny – someone whose life until then she had effectively used as a petty instrument of her own revenge. She also becomes obsessed with her own loss of the house. We do see some hope in her life though – a strong series of hints that perhaps she had a hidden lover for many years. Themes include:-	Fairytales – with of course a wicked stepmother, a magical but cursed house and two siblings. There are links also to “Nutcracker” and “Turn of the Screw” which both feature in the narrative.
It’s like you’re Hansel and Gretel. You just keep walking through the dark woods holding hands no matter how old you get. Do you ever get tired of reminsicing?
-	Self-centredness – particularly of men Danny is someone who spends most of his time reflecting on the irrationality and selfishness of the women around him (his mother who he does not remember but cannot forgive for her desertion; his sister and wife who thinks are both unfair on the other leaving him to pick up the pieces) while seemingly unaware they (and others like the ex-Dutch house servants) are largely doing nothing other than supporting him.-	The unreliability of memory, and particularly competing versions of family memory, some of which simply comes from different ages and experiences. Maeve still loves her mother’s memory but hates Andrea; Danny resents the first and is more indifferent to the second.
Do you think it’s ever possible to see the past as it actually was …….we overlay the present on to the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered
-	The superficiality of an obsession with wealth, particularly property wealth. Ann Patchett has said the book was partly inspired by how this idea seemed to dominate the last presidential election – a candidate should be elected simply because he had more (property) wealth. -	Sainthood/altruism – and what affect a rejection of riches and embrace of poverty relief has on your family – and why that is considered acceptable for a man but not a woman, and particularly not a motherAs the book gets closer to a conclusion, relationships long buried or conducted at a distance suddenly are forced into resolution (particularly Maeve/Danny with Andrea, Andrea’s children, Fiona and their own mother) or in the case of one relationship (Maeve and her lover of many years) revealed to us (although oddly it seems not to Danny). The ending of the book I initially found difficult – some people have called it a little twee or a surprise happy resolution, for me it was a continuation of a family tragedy – and obsession with property over people.Overall an extremely competently written and thoughtful book – if not one where I really empathised with any of the characters (which is always a limitation"

But even with just a few weeks until this glorious day, I could not focus on the scares and frights of the holiday. Instead I could only think about Ann Patchett’s wonderful new novel, The Dutch House. All seasonal thoughts of the macabre and the supernatural disappeared, replaced by ruminations about this heartfelt and beautiful novel. The characters haunted me like ghosts inhabiting a malevolent old manor. The story filled me up like Dr. Frankenstein filled up the head of his monster with the brain of a murderer. The pages flew by like bats, disappearing like a handful of candy corn until I was left with only sticky fingers (and a persistent tooth ache) to remind me of the journey. There were emotional moments in this excellent novel that crept up on me like a salivating werewolf hunting its prey in a pumpkin patch. They left me in tears as if I was a child whose parents ate all their trick-or treating candy and then filmed it to send in to late night TV talk-show host Jimmy Kimble for some cruel and inhumane comedy bit. The conclusion was both pensive and satisfying, not unlike a midnight visit from the Great Pumpkin herself. No, no, no there were definitely zero thoughts of Halloween floating around in my brainpan as I devoured this book, like some kind of Creature from the Black Lagoon. The Dutch House gives us the pairing of Maeve and Danny Conroy. You can add these two siblings to the vast and sweeping pantheon of brother/sister duos that have won the hearts of America. They are like Michael and Janet Jackson if Michael and Janet could neither sing nor dance, or like Warren Beatty and Shirley McClain with 100% less Academy Awards. Think Donny and Marie without the purple socks or Olympian skaters the Shib Sibs if they fell every time they put on ice-skates. The Conroy’s live outside Philadelphia in a large and fancy Netherlandish dwelling. The Conroy children first lose their mother, increasing their bond as older Maeve takes it upon herself to care for her younger brother. Their suffering only increases when a few years later their father dies and they are evicted from their home by their truly awful stepmother. Themes such as the circular paths our lives take (history repeating), forgiveness, and unreliable memories permeate this story like a trick-or-treating bag full of way too many Necco Wafers and Smarties (seriously, folks, what the hell??!). Patchett writes with a sense of compassion that coats her characters like the sweet sweet chocolate that coats a Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup. Patchett has the sense of empathy and sensitivity of someone who lives far north of her Tennessee home. This dazzling book is a must read and it is sure to illuminate your soul like a jack o’lantern stuffed with massive pillar candles. "

Dabar pagalvojęs, sakyčiau, kad stokojome vaizduotės.“5/5Magiška knyga, savo pasakiškumu primenanti geriausius vaikystės kūrinius, bet santykių sudėtingumu ir kompleksiškumu, gyvenimo tėkmės įvairialypiškumu galinti pretenduoti į Pulitzerio aukštumas. Nė akimirkai ne politiška, kuo dažnai ši premija kaltinama, bet tiesiog gyvenimiška. Buvau girdėjusi nuomonių apie siužetinius posūkius, kuriais kiti skaitytojai nepatikėjo, bet širdimi išjaučiau kiekvieną: motinos išėjimą, tėvo patriarchalinę tylą, pamotės pyktį ir žiaurumą, namo žmogiškumą, brolio ir sesers meilės pasakiškumą. Dar autorei nespėjus to paminėti, jau romanas suskambėjo ir kaip „Mažoji princesė“, ir kaip „Jonukas ir Grytutė“, tačiau čia nėra nė lašo infantilumo, o tarp skausmo – labai daug grožio. Veikėjai tikri iki menkiausios veido išraiškos, o tikriausias pats namas, valdantis visus ir kiekvieną, apsėdantis taip, kaip Shirley Jackson Hill House galėtų tik pavydėti. Galima būtų sakyti, kad moterys romane sudaiktintos, tačiau įsižiūrėjus akivaizdu, kad susidaiktino tik tos, kurios nė akimirkai nežiūrėjo į ateitį, negaudė jau pradėjusio pūsti feministinio vėjo – net jei jautė jo gūsius, dažnas pasiekdavo nebent iš literatūros, ne iš tikro gyvenimo. O gi paprasta, praktiška moteris žino geriau, nei tikėti knygomis – jose per dažnai būna „ilgai ir laimingai“, kad taip lengvai pasiduotum – ar bent akimirkai gali jas kaltinti? Nors čia moterys gana aiškiai pasiskirsto vaidmenimis, net ir menkiausi veikėjai yra įvairialypiai – negalima jų guldyti į vieną konkrečią lentyną. Tėvo veikėjas, toks tylus, veiksmais kalba tiek daug, o jo istorija nepaliauja vyniotis už siūlo galo net po to, kai jo paties jau daug metų nebėra gyvo – tai tik dar kartą įrodo autorės istorijų pasakojimo talentą. Vietomis iki skausmo norisi kiekvieną purtyti – tai dėl vienos priežasties, tai dėl kitos, tačiau kaip ir gyvenime – lengviausia paleisti gyventi. Romanas pasakojimo lengvumu ir teksto plaukimu skaitosi kur kas lengviau nei autorės „Vieningieji“ ar net „Nuostaba“, tačiau tai gali būti ir nuostabiosios vertėjos G.G.-Bernotienės nuopelnas – jos rankose Patchett tekstas sužiba papildoma magija, o Olandų namo auksai įgauna tokį gylį, kad gniaužia kvapą.

181,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4456042-alena,Rating 5 out of 5,"Another win from Ann Patchett. I am so very grateful to have been able to escape into a brilliant novel these past few days as reality has been too much to bear.I think what I appreciate most about Patchett is her surgical precision in cutting into family dynamics. It’s the pervading theme of most of her novels and yet her approach, her characters, her storytelling is always fresh. For instance, the longing, bitterness, mistrust and loyalty of the Conroy Family in her latest novel may feel familiar, but the additional character of a house adds a whole new layer to Patchett’s writing. I could picture it, and feel both its grandeur and its oppression. ""The point, I wanted to say, was that we shouldn’t still be driving to the Dutch House, and the more we kept up with our hate, the more we were forever doomed to live out our lives in a parked car on VanHoebeek Street.""The relationships between three generations of this family, against the backdrop of this house, just felt incredibly “right.”“I had only ever seen him as my father, and as my father I had judged him. There was nothing to do about that now but add it to the catalog of my mistakes.”I’m a sucker for broken families, but ultimately, what ties me to Patchett is always her strong writing. I stopped many (many) times to read a paragraph 2 or 3 times, because I am in awe of how she cuts to the emotional truth so effortlessly.""There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you’d been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet in place, and for a moment you’re suspended, knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself.""There are too many favorite lines and moments for me to type, but one that will stick with me for a while:“She might have packed her original disappointment away in a box, but she carried the box with her wherever she went.”Ann Patchett is simply an American master.

Just after WWII, Cyril Conroy buys the palatial mansion – fully and sumptuously furnished – for his wife Elna and it is where Danny and Maeve Conroy grew up. Danny is our first-person narrator and he and Maeve are a modern day Hansel and Gretel, complete with abandonment, banishment, and a wicked step-mother. They even have three Fairy Godmothers: Fluffy, Sandy, and Jocelyn.“The Dutch House” is the story of a “modern family”, as this was the era when families started to become fractured and step-parents and step-siblings became more prevalent. Some of these themes Patchett explored beautifully in “Commonwealth”, and she knows whereof she speaks because she’s written essays about her own large, extended, loosely-related-by-a-string, family.I was absorbed from page one, and I hated to turn the last page. What makes Patchett so accessible and relevant is her beautiful writing, her wit, and the fascinating stories she spins out of every-day life.At the most surprising, dramatic, and climactic scene in the novel Danny narrates: “I had not been born with an imagination large enough to encompass this moment.” Well, Ann Patchett was born with an imagination large enough – thank heavens! What a magnificent story!"
183,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5550397-britany,Rating 3 out of 5,"Danny & Maeve are siblings that live in the Dutch House. The house is in main character it itself. They move into the house fully furnished and the items in the house are specific and nuanced, creating a unique reading experience.The story is told from Danny's perspective and goes in and out changing from past to present and jumps around a little bit in the timeline. This took a little while to get used to for me. The Dutch House is a character study of one family, fading in and out and as different life events change the outcome, however the house always maintains a strong sense of place and a sounding board which these characters constantly rotate around. Patchett does such a wonderful job of illustrating lives of normal families and a mini universe into one novel. This one just didn't connect as deeply with me as I had hoped. I never fully believed the story coming from Danny's perspective. I think Patchett attempted something, but it didn't work for me. I never truly cared about these characters and really only found myself interested in Maeve. She was the most interesting and I really wish the novel was from her POV. This is my second Patchett, Commonwealth being my first, and I liked that one much better than this one. I will continue to pick up more by her and while I appreciate her writing, I'm not sure how much I will take with me over the years."

Tom Hanks narrates the audio and does a terrific job! I don’t even know how to explain what this book is about without making it sound uneventful because there really isn’t much to tell. It’s about a house and a family. It’s also kind of about relationships, hurt, pain and forgiveness. I feel like different readers will come away with different meanings and messages depending on one’s own experiences and interpretations. It is a straightforward story with many layers weaved into it. It was simple yet complex. Told through the eyes of a man looking back at his family history and complicated family dynamics growing up in The Dutch House. The writing was warm and inviting. The characters were impeccably developed. A beautiful heartwarming story that will captivate and charm most readers."

But then in the last sections of the book it hit me and I loved it. Danny the narrator is so un observant half the time, or at least he only sees what he wants to see or how it affects him, whereas all the female characters around him seem much more complex and I would’ve loved to hear their voices and their reasons for their actions. Maeve in particular is a wonderful character. Parenting, (especially how we view mothers)the roles of women in society, memories, forgiveness seem to be the main themes to me. The story jumps around a bit in time but was easy to follow."

I can’t write a balanced review of this book, even though I’ve read and absorbed the whole story and retained more than enough of it to do a writeup on it. It’s just that, thinking back on this novel, which I listened to on audiobook, and also while I was listening to it, all I can/could focus on is how much Tom Hanks’s voice got in the way. This is entirely on me. I’m used to listening audiobooks in general and to famous voices too, and it’s never happened before. The famous person always faded into the background and became just a voice. Here, it was Tom Hanks overlaid on every scene. He never just became a narrator telling a story. This is one of those cases where I would’ve enjoyed eye-reading a lot more. Less interference. I don’t know why I didn’t realize this early on and just pick up another format immediately because it spoiled the story. It’s no longer “A Story”. It’s “The story told by Tom Hanks”. And that colours every single part of it. And it’s extremely annoying. Because I’ve only read Bel Canto so far, and found it brilliant, and loved Ann Patchett’s writing, and have a couple of books by her in physical form in a pile or shelf somewhere. And I had to pick this one, and Tom Hanks, of all people, ruined this one for me. Which is so strange to say, because I love Tom Hanks as an actor. Very much. I’m actually very distraught about this. I did think it was a very odd casting. And the only way I can make sense of it is he must’ve bought the movie rights and will be in the lead role? I’m just surmising. It all quite odd. TO ME. I’m sure other listeners will be fine with it. I’m an odd fish. I mean, how many people do you know who write non-reviews about why they can’t write a proper review of a book by an author they like and have actually read?! "

As much as i like Tom Hanks for sure i did not want him reading to me, reallly. But the more i listened the more i fell in love with the character's and the story. It's a story of family happiness, joy , sadness and so much pain but it all worked for them in such a good way that as a reader you realized that the pain and sorrow was meant to get them to a good place in their life. As a narrator Tom Hanks kept the story so calm and at peace so that i never saw the pain coming. Kudos to the author and Tom Hanks you got this one right. This story will only work for readers of love, compassion, empathy and understanding of different moral compasses, and for that i loved it❤"

How a book that I tried unsuccessfully to connect with half a dozen times became absolutely resplendent once I listened to it on audio. It became glowing and intimate and insightful and beautiful. What seemed mundane became absolutely magical in Tom Hanks’ bewitching narration. I found myself tearing up at multiple points, absolutely in love with the power of memory and family and forgiveness."
192,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"First, a confession (of sorts). I was ill when I was reading much of this book. Not a serious illness, happily, but one of those viral things that cloud vision and mind alike. Hence, I'm not clear on which reactions come from the book and which from my befuddled state. That said: I liked the book a lot. The story was addictive and the characters engaging. It's probably the most accessible of the author's books I've read, but beneath its pellucid surface lay matters of great depth. I'll leave plot summaries to readers far more capable than I.The book bears within it an implicit question that expands over the course of the story. Patchett might have given it any number of titles, but naming it after the house itself can't help but intrigue. ""Dutch House"" as in ""Bleak House""? The ""House of Usher""? What is the building meant to signify? And why does it have such remarkable power over the characters, drawing them irresistably toward it again and again, and then propelling them away? What the Dutch House means to each person in the book is the engine that drives the story. ""I was still at a point in my life,"" a character thinks, ""when the house was the hero of every story, our lost and beloved country."" But elsewhere, the same character will observe:  The Dutch House was impossible. I had never thought that before. When Maeve told me that our mother had hated it, I couldn't even understand what she was saying. Time in ""The Dutch House"" is not linear. The story moves from past to present to future and back, and more than a few major revelations are made in an offhand manner (as in, 'many years later, when I was serving a life sentence for murder' -- NOT a real example, just meant to give an idea of what I mean: it's not central to the plot, but it's not nothing either). The effect of this temporal fluidity on the reader is less a matter of confusion than it is a lens that draws attention to how our perceptions change over time. What a young mind perceives as meaning one thing, the same mind looking back decades later understands to mean something entirely different. Even in adulthood, things are not necessarily what we take them to be.Indeed, ""The Dutch House"" is at its heart an examination of how flawed our perceptions can be, how mistaken our memories, how complicated our relationships and motivations, how surprisingly little we know about ourselves and the people around us. Time and again the protagonist will discover how wrong he was about something he was certain he ""knew.""  There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you'd been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet in place, and for a moment you're suspended, knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself.  Such moments resonate, sometimes touchingly --  After so many years I thought less about [my father's] unwillingness to disclose and more about how stupid I'd been not to try harder.  -- and sometimes with wry but insightful irony --  The truth is I have plenty of memories of her being perfectly decent. I just choose to dwell on the ones in which she wasn't. And this:  'God's truth,' Maeve said. 'Our father was a man who had never met his own wife.' There is much in ""The Dutch House"" to be pondered and (though I hate the word) unpacked. There are echoes of Gatsby and Dickens here, but I suspect readers will respond more with a slowly building sense of recognition in Patchett's depiction of memories, families, and motivations. I can't imagine a reader who will not pause for several moments and wonder (critically? understandingly?) at a character's behavior or decisions. (I could give some examples that I'm sure would intrigue readers of this review, but I don't want to risk sharing spoilers.)""The Dutch House"" will find a broad and eager audience. It deserves to."
193,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75183808-kathryn-in-fl,Rating 3 out of 5,"Ann Patchett's latest tale demonstrates another complex family dynamic in which a very unique and extravagant house is a metaphor for family secrets, personal desires and personal priorities. Cyril Conroy, a man with little manages to make a timely business decision that allows him to quickly achieve substantial wealth. He loves architecture and buys a grand home for his wife and young daughter, Maeve. Unfortunately, his wife does not hold the same values and feels uncomfortable with this vulgar show of wealth and opulence. Ultimately, the house represents their very different values. Which impacts their marriage and the health of their other relationships. Later, Cyril marries his second wife, Andrea, a woman, who adores the home. However, they learn that they don't seem to be able to parlay their shared admiration of the home into a thriving marriage. It doesn't compensate for the other values that they don't agree on. The pain each party feels is significant and becomes toxic in ways, they don't really understand fully. Sides are chosen and battles ensue. Bitterness rules so many of their interactions within the family that vengeance is what motivates much of the important interactions, putting peace and happiness as a nearly non-existent preference. It then becomes a pervasive force in Cyril's son, Danny's and Maeve's key life choices. Their poor priorities rob them for decades forward.Patchett is more than adequately equipped in her analysis of family dynamics. Yet, this doesn't make give any significant revelations to the reader, we haven't seen in so many other books. Though the house is a character, we have seen that done as well. Though her writing is above average, for me I don't think that alone makes it that more readable and certainly not profound. I will add that I observed two structural errors in the story that the editor should have caught and changed before the book's release (this was a published final copy not an ARC).I appreciate the lessons and insights that Ms. Patchett wishes to convey to her readers. Even today, this modern retelling of ages old parable is needed. However, I don't find it wholly original. I have read this story with different character's names, different cities, in different decades and even different countries. I was just not as excited about it as others have been. I am not saying it isn't a valuable story. I am saying I liked other's versions more (although I can't think of a title of any off top of my head (due to my traumatic brain injury)). The publisher acknowledges the nod to F. Scott Fitzgerald and it is a pretty obvious analogy to those familiar with his work. Though in many ways there are differences and I thought Fitzgerald did such a better job conveying his observations. There is a reason others copy good literature. It works. That's summarizes my opinion. This is another variation on ""The Great Gatsby"" and other novels focused on misplaced priorities in relationships. If you like that, you will probably find this likable tale.Bye the way, Charles Dickens did a bang up job in his novel using the house as a metaphor in ""Great Expectations"". This is my second book by Ms. Patchett, I may give her one more try."

One of those books that I bought on a whim because firstly, I liked the title, secondly the publishing house was Bloomsbury and thirdly the familial aspect to it.The first page had me entranced through to the end of the book and what a fascinating array of characters.The book is narrated by Danny Conroy who ""grows up in the Dutch House, a lavish folly in small-town Pennsylvania taken on by his property development father."" His parents, Cyril and Elna, had been poor but the father had done very well indeed in real-estate and their standard of living had improved tremendously. They were now very, very rich. His mother however hated the house so much that she kept coming and going and then finally disappeared. Both Danny and his elder sibling Maeve were really upset with this and finally the father told them Elna had gone to India. They never heard anything more about her until years later, five decades, and what an incredible story that proved with a most unexpected outcome.The book is fundamentally about the fixation of Danny and Maeve for the Dutch House caused by his father getting divorced and marrying Andrea who had two young girls. When Cyril dies, Maeve had already moved to her own apartment but Danny gets literally tossed out of the family home at the age of fifteen as Andrea has no wish to bring him up. There was no will but Andrea kept the house and all the businesses of her husband as she had ensured that she legally shared all the properties involved.The sections that really amazed me was that the two siblings used to sit outside the Dutch House, in Elkins Park, in Maeve's car smoking and looking in. Perhaps hoping to see Andrea? I don't know. I actually felt like a voyeur myself and when they both finally gained access to the house, well, I confess that I've never read anything like that before in my life!Like swallows, like salmon, we were the helpless captives of our migratory patterns. We pretended that what we had lost was the house, not our mother, not our father. We pretended that what we had lost had been taken from us by the person who still lived inside.

Your books, the last three in particular, have gotten me so deeply involved with your characters that I have felt bereft when they’re over. “Wait- I’m not done with you!,” I wail. And then I mourn a little and am unable to really get into other books for the next couple of days. You know this feeling? I call it a book hangover.Nobody writes about the interior lives of families like Patchett. The inside jokes, the resentments that go on for years, the little rivalries and the deep, idiosyncratic, lasting connections. This book pulls you right into its world, and I just finished it this morning (when I had other things I was supposed to be doing), but I’m sad not to have that world anymore.In this family, the mother leaves- when her son is 3 and her daughter is 10- and the father marries a wicked stepmother. The Dutch House is an amazing, one-of-a-kind mansion in the Philadelphia suburbs, and it’s called the Dutch House because the father in this family purchased it, fully furnished, decorated, and stuffed full of the former owners’ clothing and other possessions (and even a library full of Dutch books) from the Dutch family who owned it before. There are even paintings of the matriarch and the patriarch of the family on either side of the fireplace, and up they stay through the years.The stepmother is very wicked, and the repercussions of what happens to the son in this family, who is also the narrator, and his sister Maeve, who I absolutely ADORED, go on through the decades. Decades of surprising conversations, alliances, returns and departures.I don’t know how she does it. She not only creates the people, she creates this whole world. Late in the book, the narrator remembers a secret drawer in a table and finds quarters he knows have been stuffed away there for decades, and I could actually feel the slightly warped drawer opening with some resistance, smell the old wood and long abandoned change. This is delightful. Just what I want from fiction. There aren’t many writers whose ages I google, greedily, wishing for their good health and a lot more books. (Oh, good. She’s just a year older than me. Eat your green soup, Ms. Patchett.)"

Στην αρχή είχα δυσανασχετήσει με όλη αυτή τη θύελλα αναρτήσεων στα μέσα κοινωνικής δικτύωσης, ειδ��κά από τη στιγμή που το βιβλίο δεν είχε προλάβει καλά καλά να κυκλοφορήσει. Είχα φοβηθεί μην μου συμβεί το ίδιο με τις καραβίδες και για το λόγο αυτό εσκεμμένα πρόσεχα να αποφεύγω τα σχόλια που το αφορούσαν γιατί για εμένα ήταν ένα βιβλίο το οποίο εποφθαλμιούσα πριν ακόμη μεταφραστεί στα ελληνικά και δεν ήθελα να επηρεαστώ ή με προκαταβάλει κάτι που μπορεί να έχει γραφτεί είτε με θετικό είτε με αρνητικό τρόπο. Αρχικά, ξεκινώντας από το εξώφυλλο χαίρομαι πάρα πολύ που οι εκδόσεις Δώμα αποφάσισαν να κρατήσουν αυτό της ξένης έκδοσης, καθώς πιστεύω πως δύσκολα θα βρισκόταν κάποιο άλλο να το ξεπεράσει. Κατά δεύτερον, όταν ξεκίνησα επιτέλους να το διαβάζω ενθουσιάστηκα πάρα πολύ που η αφήγηση γινόταν σε πρώτο αντρικό πρόσωπο, αφού από την περίληψη είχα την εντύπωση ή ότι θα ήταν σε τρίτο ή πως θα γινόταν από τη μεριά του κοριτσιού. Και τρίτο και βασικό είναι ότι αγαπώ να διαβάζω ό,τι μοιάζει ή έχει σχέση με οικογενειακό saga ακόμη κι αν το συγκεκριμένο αφορά μία διαλυμένη οικογένεια, αφού πολύ γρήγορα στο βιβλίο τα δύο αγαπημένα αδέλφια, η Μέιβ και ο Ντάνι, μένουν μόνα και μάλιστα εξοστρακισμένα από την πατρική τους οικία. Η άτακτη κι άδικη αυτή φυγή θα γίνει και το σημείο αναφοράς τους όσα χρόνια και αν περάσουν, με το παρελθόν να μοιάζει σαν αναπόδραστος παράγοντας για τη μετέπειτα ζωή τους. Το Ολλανδέζικο σπίτι γίνεται κάτι σαν εμμονή, αφού μέσα σε αυτό έζησαν μαζί με τους γονείς τους και είναι αναπόσπαστο κομμάτι από την παιδική τους ηλικία που σαν να τελείωσε απότομα την εποχή που αναγκάστηκαν να το αποχωριστούν κι ας μην είχαν όλα τα μέλη της μεγάλο θαυμασμό για αυτό όσο καιρό ήταν κάτοικοί του. Είναι ένα πολύ τρυφερό στην ουσία του βιβλίο με μία από τις πιο δυνατές κι αξιομνημόνευτες αδελφικές αγάπες που έχω συναντήσει σε μυθιστόρημα. Σίγουρα από εκείνα τα βιβλία που αξίζουν τα όποια καλά σχόλια έχουν ακουστεί και που το εξώφυλλο είναι ανάλογο του περιεχομένου."

We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we're not seeing it as the people we were, we're seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.” There’s not much I can say about The Dutch House that has not been said yet, so I’ll keep it short and sweet. The audio book narrated by Tom Hanks is perfection, without “doing” any voices he becomes every character and infuses the story with some added humor. I thought this was well-written, not necessarily beautiful and flowery, but Ann Patchett has a way of saying something in just the right way, so finally something that you have always known now has words to express it. I really liked Maeve and Danny, but felt that many of the other characters, especially Celeste, could have been more developed. The ending also wasn’t as strong as the rest of the book, but still worth your time.Oh, and that cover! think it’s my favorite for 2019."

I always imagined the house would die without us. I don't know, I thought it would crumple up. Do houses ever die of grief?

Look at the three of us, undone by a house. It's insane.

Home is so sad. It stays as it was left,Shaped to the comfort of the last to goAs if to win them back. Instead, bereftOf anyone to please, it withers so,Having no heart to put aside the theftAnd turn again to what it started as,A joyous shot at how things ought to be,Long fallen wide. You can see how it was:Look at the pictures and the cutlery.The music in the piano stool. That vase.(Home is so Sad, Philip Larkin)
It doesn't take long for the reader to grasp that 'the Dutch House' is going to be a character in this novel; the title is a big hint, and then the novel begins with a description of the house's features, including the life-sized portraits of the VanHoebeeks - the creators and first owners of the house. The VanHoebeek story is portent and cautionary tale: a fortune suddenly made, a house built to be a family's crowning glory, then a series of tragedies and losses. But it wasn't until I neared the end of the story that I realised that The Dutch House reminded me of Manderley (in Rebecca) - surely one of the most famous house-as-characters in all of literature. The house is a shifting symbol : a place of safety, or a prison. Its ownership is contested. Its caretaker loves it best. It falls into decay and then is restored. It is the paradoxical shuttered heart in Larkin's poem: it holds the family's memories, but when the family no longer exists, those memories become unutterably sad.Memory, and our reconstructions and misunderstandings of the past, are major themes of this book. The idea of a house as a repository of memory is the cornerstone of the plot. The book takes place during the post-war decades (late 1940s to early 1990s) when America was experiencing a huge economic expansion - the 'golden age' of the middle class. The era in which home ownership, for the many and not just the few, was an achievable dream. The Dutch House is an exemplar of a house, but the importance of property and home ownership recur again and again in the plot. Both Danny, the book's narrator, and his father are property developers. Home ownership, and its opposite - homelessness - play a variety of roles in the plot. The story is told from the point-of-view of Danny Conroy and he's an interesting sort of unreliable narrator. I couldn't quite decide if he was unreliable, or only limited. Danny often gets the wrong end of the stick. He doesn't know everything, he doesn't always ask questions, he wasn't around for some of the most important developments and furthermore his understanding is hampered by what my mother has always referred to as 'male obliviousness'. The story jumps back and forth in time, and the reader can only piece it together when Danny does. In some novels, the reader can see and understand plenty that the narrator does not grasp; this novel is not like that. Instead, Patchett skilfully builds up the story by feeding pieces of it to the reader via Danny. There are several fairy-tale tropes in this book: there is Andrea, the wicked usurping stepmother, and there are Maeve and Danny, the children who have been displaced from their home and cursed to wander in the wilderness (in the style of Hansel and Gretel). Maeve has the colouring of a Snow White, and also that of her Irish mother - who has been missing for many years. The past tends to repeat itself, and it was satisfying as a reader to see the missing parents of Maeve and Danny come into focus as they themselves grew up. This is not only because they begin to learn more about their parents, but also because the two main characters replicate personality characteristics and patterns of behaviour first set in motion by the older generation. Danny exemplifies that well-known quotation by George Santayana: 'Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.'
There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you'd been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet in place, and for a moment you're suspended, knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself.

The problem, I wanted to say, was that I was asleep to the world. Even in my own house I had no idea what was going on.
The plot turns on a hinge which wasn't entirely believable to me, but allowing for that, it was a hugely enjoyable and satisfying read. Patchett writes such clear, elegant prose, and the book was beautifully constructed and held my attention throughout. Although Danny narrates the book, Maeve was the stand-out character - truly one of the best characters in Patchett's canon. A solid 4.5 stars"
202,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2050107-jane,Rating 4 out of 5,"I loved Ann Patchett's last novel and that caught me by surprise, because I had liked some of her earlier books but she had never been one of those authors I felt I must read and must look out for a new book.Not until that book made me look out for this book.When I first caught a glimpse I saw that it was a beautiful object,  when I read the premise of the story I was intrigued, and when I started reading I was captivated.I thought of it for some time after I had finished reading, and I realised that it was a book that I had loved on a number of different levels.It's a book about people. Many books are, but this is one of those books that make you feel that that you are reading about real people, that you might have mutual friends, and that a friend might have told you some of this story, because there are a great many people in the world who have stories that are more than worthy of retelling.I believed in the people in this book. I believed they lived and breathed and that their stories were true.This is also a book about a house.Seen from certain vantage points of distance, it appeared to float several inches above the hill it sat on. The panes of glass that surrounded the glass front doors were as big as storefront windows and held in place by wrought-iron vines. The windows both took in the sun and reflected it back against the wide lawn.The Dutch House was named not for its architecture but for the nationality of its original owners, the Van Hoebeeks, who had built it when they prospered in the twenties. Their home boasted Delft mantels, marble floors, ornate fireplaces and gilt ceilings;  it was adorned with silk chairs, tapestry ottomans and oil paintings; and it was a house like no other.By the late forties the Van Hoebeeks had lost everything, and so they sold the Dutch House to Cyril Conroy, an ambitious property developer who had risen from humble beginnings. He acquired everything - the house, the grounds, the furnishings, the staff - and only when he brought his family to see the house for the first time did he tell them that he owned it and it was their new home. His wife, Elna, and their children, Maeve and Danny, were transplanted from a small apartment to a grand, ready-made new home and lifestyle with no warning at all.Cyril saw the  Dutch House as a the ultimate symbol of his success, but Elna saw it rather differently. She saw it as a work of art but she knew that she could not be happy there, that it would never be her home; and her spirit faded, she began to spend more and more time away from the house, until that day came when she didn't come 'home' again.It wasn't long until an attractive young widow with two daughters found her way into Cyril's life, and into the Dutch House. She would become his second wife, she would take possession, and when the children of the first marriage would be pushed out. They would return to look at the Dutch House, but they would keep their distance and they would have to make their own way in the world.All of that had lovely echoes of fairy tales. These echoes were strong and yet that story felt utterly real and natural.The story unfolded beautifully. It had a clear path, and there were many interesting developments along that path. Some of those developments I expected, but some I did not. There were times when I thought that the story was going to go one way but it went another, and so I was always interested, and though I had an idea of where things might be going I was never entirely sure.Those stories had the untidiness of real lives. Mistakes of the past were repeated, but maybe that is inevitable.“We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.”The evolution of the characters and their relationships was fascinating. As the younger characters grew up and the adult characters aged some things changed and some things remained the same; and though some of their actions seemed improbable their lives all felt utterly real. My perceptions of characters didn't change too much but as I spent more time with them I came to understand them much better.They weren't characters to love, I didn't want them to be more that friends of friends, but I did want to learn their stories.This stories had much to say, they were written with intelligence and insight, and they were a joy to read."

А потом клокотать от несправедливости стало меньше, сказочная шпаклевка начала осыпаться, пока в руках не остался просто спокойный тихий роман про людей, которые живут свои спокойные тихие жизни. Они постоянно оглядываются на прошлое, но это им нисколько не мешает добиваться своего. Они грустят о том, что у них отобрали, но это не становится психотравмой. Они заботятся друг о друге, но не так, чтобы читатель обзавидовался или получил сахарную кому. Например, книги Энн Тайлер для меня немного чересчур добрые и милые, а у Энн Пэтчетт всего в меру, без патоки и разбитых сердец.Казалось бы, в истории про отобранный дом и исчезнувшую мать должны стремиться вернуть дом и найти мать. Нет, тут будут заниматься замороженными овощами и нелюбимой медициной, потому что «так надо». Тут нет погони за счастьем — Мэйв и Дэнни уже по-своему счастливы, а новые обстоятельства лишь делают их жизнь еще чуточку лучше. Энн Пэтчетт, в легком стиле и крупными мазками, уместила в 300 страниц жизнь целой семьи. При этом, как было при чтении «Щегла», все вокруг будто бы залито золотистым светом — драма приходила внезапно и без нагнетания, на хороших событиях мы слышали пару диалогов, а затем камера отдалялась, чтобы не нарушать интимность момента и позволить семье побыть наедине друг с другом. При этом автор как будто немного отстранён от персонажей и вроде бы не сильно о них заботится. И это понятно, поскольку в своем желании насолить Мэйв становилась не самым приятным человеком, а ее успешный брат лишь переживает, что хочет с��упать дома и сдавать их в аренду, а не вырезать аппендиксы и говорить семьям больных, что у пациента обнаружен рак. Но несмотря на все это, книгу невозможно отложить в сторону — ты проваливаешься в историю, мчишься по ней, поражаешься естественным диалогам и логичности всего происходящего. Ты радуешься, что никто не забирается на трибуну, не вещает о пластике, загнивающем искусстве или демилитаризации, тут умилительно смотрят невыносимый балет «Щелкунчик» и говорят о вечном и важном. Да так хорошо и складно, что и читателю потом останется «на подумать». Особенно хорошо посмотреть на историю Мэйв и Дэнни глазами Нормы и Брайт — сводных сестер, оставшихся в Голландском доме. Про них нам ничего не говорят, но там есть чему сопереживать, поэтому обратите внимание.Эта книга отличный повод никуда не пойти и остаться дома. Ее можно поставить на полку, а потом перечитывать раз в несколько лет, как пересматривать любимый фильм, который знаешь наизусть. Может, «Голландский дом» чуть слабее «Своих-чужих», но, знаете, всем бы такие книги. Энн Пэтчетт для меня точно главная писательница 2021 года!"

You know that feeling-warmth, trust and the belief the other person genuinely cares. Ann Patchett’s uncomplicated narrative flows off the page-it is beautiful in its simplicity. This novel is about a complex American family. There are characters to love and to despise. It was so easy for me to lose myself in the story and I believe the simple but brilliantly written narrative was the reason. Patchett did not overuse any literary techniques or tricks. Let’s talk about the book’s cover. It is stunning in its simplicity just like the book. In addition, it does not include two figures with their back to the reader, so overused recently. The cover actually has a strong connection to the book-again rare in today’s publisher’s art departments. This cover alone, the expression on the girl’s face, will intrigue potential readers who may never read Patchett previously. Loved, loved, loved this novel.

205,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17465866-anni,Rating 4 out of 5,"Ann Patchett writes like another of my favourite American authors - Anne Tyler, with character-driven plots revealed through convincing dialogue. In this novel, fairytale elements and archetypes abound, along with references to many characters in literature: we have the perennial wicked stepmother, the banished or abandoned children, plus the ghost stories or a haunted house as in Henry James’ Turn of the screw, and the thwarting of love and ambition in Great Expectations. There is even a curtained window seat reminiscent of another orphan tale, “Jane Eyre.” Despite these mythical aspects, Patchett manages to make the narrative plausible enough to suspend disbelief, although the reason for disappearance of the mother stretched my credulity.The story unspools and loops backwards and forwards, so that we see it from the differing perspectives of the narrator as he grows up and recollects on the past which, as we now know, is not only another country, but one where the landscape alters when seen from the distance of time."

Ms. Patchett's style is unadorned, fluid, and breathes with confidence and assurance. I have often said, that aspiring mystery writers should read all of Agatha Christie's novels, and learn how to truly write a mystery.In the case of Ms. Patchett, I would say that all aspiring, serious writers of drama should read this wonderful writer's works. This is the third book I have read by her, and each one was wonderful and a lesson in how to write fluid, lucid, enthralling novels with great characters.Maeve, the main female character in the book, is so perfectly developed through five decades of her life that you feel like you know her intimately, as though you have lived next door to her your whole life. The story is told in first person narrative by her younger brother Danny and it is the relationship between Maeve and him that is so inspiring and loving. It is a book that will stay with you for a long time. I highly, highly recommend."

All I can figure out is that I was swept away by a master storyteller. One who can make a house into a major character. One who can develop characters with a fine brush. One who can move at a snail’s pace and I’m perfectly content. Each word seems to be right exactly where it belongs. I’ll come back to edit this review if my thoughts become more cohesive with time. I just finished it today.

212,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5067228-marianne,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Dutch House is the seventh novel by NYT best-selling American author, Ann Patchett. It had been Danny’s childhood home. Cyril Conroy had bought the incredible Dutch House, there in small-town Pennsylvania, in 1946 for his young family: his wife Elna, and five-year-old Maeve. It was just as the last Van Hoebeek, the original owners, had left it: furnishings, fittings, even clothing. Danny was born a few years later, and lived there until his step-mother threw him out at fifteen.Danny’s mom had left when he was three; he was eight when Andrea Smith first came on the scene, but he and Maeve dismissed any idea of permanence. Andrea persisted, though; Andrea was fascinated with every detail of The Dutch House and Van Hoebeek family, who had made their fortune in packaged cigarettes. Had Maeve and Danny paid more attention, they might have seen the signs, they might have predicted, but not prevented, it: just three years after she had first stood in front of the Van Hoebeek portraits in the drawing room, Andrea married Cyril, and took up residence in The Dutch House with her daughters. No longer were they the comfortable Conroy trio, lovingly cared for by Sandy and Jocelyn. Danny had counted on following his canny father into real estate and construction; instead, Maeve insisted he study medicine at Columbia: their father’s trust, grudgingly dispensed by Andrea, was covering the not-inconsiderable cost. And on visits home, the siblings would park on Van Hoebeek Street, regard The Dutch House, and fume over their stolen inheritance, their self-made father’s fortune.Maeve, aware Cyril’s humble beginnings, was the most resentful; Danny had “never been in the position of getting my head around what I’d been given. I only understood what I’d lost.” Not until a career had been gained and discarded, and a marriage and children made, some twenty-seven years after they had been ejected from The Dutch House, did Maeve and Danny finally acknowledge what their obsession had done to them: “We had made a fetish out of our misfortune, fallen in love with it. I was sickened to realize we’d kept it going for so long”While Danny’s wife seems resentful of his close relationship with his sister, it is not until a certain, somewhat familiar old woman turns up at Maeve’s hospital bed that he realises: “I had a mother who left when I was a child. I didn’t miss her. Maeve was there, with her red coat and her black hair, standing at the bottom of the stairs, the white marble floor with the little black squares, the snow coming down in glittering sheets in the windows behind her, the windows as wide as a movie screen… ‘Danny!’ she would call up to me. ‘Breakfast. Move yourself.’”This is very much a character-driven story, and it clearly demonstrates Patchett’s literary skill: her characters are interesting and allowed to grow and develop, to display insight and utter wise words. The bond between the siblings is so well portrayed, it’s impossible not to feel for them. Like Anne Tyler, Patchett manages to make the lives of fairly ordinary people doing fairly ordinary things worth reading about.Patchett’s prose is wonderful: “The madder Maeve got, the more thoughtful she became. In this way she reminded me of our father – every word she spoke came individually wrapped” and “Her wrist looked like ten pencils bundles together”. And that striking cover? It neatly ties the whole thing together, beginning and end. What a wonderful read!!"
213,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9582364-andrea,Rating 5 out of 5,"4.5★, rounded up.I was thrilled to receive an advance copy of this book from Bloomsbury, as Ann Patchett is one of my favourite authors. While reading it, I couldn't help but compare it with her previous novel, Commonwealth, which I liked but didn't love. This one, I loved. Both are strongly character-driven stories about family, but somehow The Dutch House also has more plot and was therefore more satisfying as I turned the final page.Told in the first person, from the point of view of Daniel Conroy, this is the story of 3 generations of the Conroys and their relationship to the Dutch House in Elkins Park. The house is such an integral part of the story, it's like a family member in its own right. Built by cigarette-distribution magnates, the VanHoebeeks, the house has become ridiculously opulent in what became suburban Philadelphia, but was probably considered more tasteful or understated as part of the vast Elkins Park countryside of the pre-war era in which it was built. When the last of the VanHoebeeks died, Cyril Conroy was able to buy it lock, stock and barrel, for a good price. The house came fully furnished and decorated with all the VanHoebeeks possessions including clothes, ornaments and paintings. The life-size twin portraits of Mr and Mrs VanHoebeek continued to oversee the life of the house long after they were gone, from their position in the drawing room. Mr & Mrs VanHoebeek, who had no first names that I had ever heard, were old in their portraits but not entirely ancient. They both dressed in black and stood with an erect formality that spoke of another time. Even in their separate frames they were so together, so married, I always thought it must have been one large painting that someone cut in half. Because the house also came with one of their former staff, Fiona, the stories of the Dutch family stayed with the house and it was almost as though the VanHoebeeks became an older, more remote generation of the Conroy family.However, the purchase of the Dutch House was the beginning of the end of Cyril's marriage to Elna (Danny's mother), and therefore an early catalyst to his unhappy second marriage, to the much younger Andrea Smith. Both of these events necessarily shaped the close relationship between Danny and his older sister Maeve, as their father became more distant.Although the story jumps back and forth from when Danny was about 4 years old, to his late 40s or early 50s, Patchett skilfully brings the reader along and there is no danger of getting lost. There is a very recognisable arc that proceeds in a traditional linear direction over the top of the detours and meanderings. Towards the end, some threads of the story even come full circle and for me this was particularly satisfying.Danny's narration has a friendly, almost confiding tone that really draws you in and makes you care about his family. He admits to being a funny (i.e. odd), unobservant kid - such as the time he suddenly realised the housekeeper and the cook were more than just workmates - and this serves to highlight the exceptional traits of his beloved sister. Due to their closeness we also get to know Maeve pretty well, or perhaps I should qualify that and say we know her family life pretty well. We don't know her personal life, although there are hints and we can speculate about what's going on there. But when I think about my own brother and me - with a similar age gap - I think that's realistic!Despite being banished from the Dutch House while Danny was still at high school, the house continues to be a magnet for Danny and Maeve long into their adult lives until they consciously decide to give it up. And then after a major disruption in the family, the Dutch House once again takes centre stage. I thought this was the perfect ending, providing the opportunity to get over so many regrets for so many characters.I could go on - there is so, so much more. Suffice to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the past few days, being immersed in the richly detailed, warm world of the Conroys and their Dutch House."
214,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/93872039-tinichix-nicole,Rating 5 out of 5,"Wow, this was great. My only regret is that I didn’t get to this one sooner. I did this as an audio book and am so glad I did, Tom Hanks was the perfect narrator and addition to this story. For the most part it ends up that most books I read or listen to have a female protagonist. I somehow ended up having both my physical book and audio book both be a male protagonist this time around. That for sure doesn’t happen often for me. It was a definite bonus for this particular book. Our Goodreads synopsis informs us that “At the end of the Second World War, Cyril Conroy combines luck and a single canny investment to begin an enormous real estate empire, propelling his family from poverty to enormous wealth. His first order of business is to buy the Dutch House, a lavish estate in the suburbs outside of Philadelphia. Meant as a surprise for his wife, the house sets in motion the undoing of everyone he loves.The story is told by Cyril’s son Danny, as he and his older sister, the brilliantly acerbic and self-assured Maeve, are exiled from the house where they grew up by their stepmother. The two wealthy siblings are thrown back into the poverty their parents had escaped from and find that all they have to count on is one another. It is this unshakable bond between them that both saves their lives and thwarts their futures.Set over the course of five decades, The Dutch House is a dark fairy tale about two smart people who cannot overcome their past.”“Disappointment comes from expectation.”It was amazing to me how the recollection of the same events differs between siblings, just as in real life. Being an only child I always find the dynamics of siblings fascinating. Between the story following the siblings and the rest of the family sagas this book checked all the boxes for me. I loved the time span of the five decades and how seemless it was. It flowed wonderfully and never felt disjointed or confusing. I was completely immersed the whole time. I particularly liked Danny questioning so many things about growing up and his family that he never took the time to ask or wonder about previously. I also enjoyed how his character struggled with what he wanted to do with his life. Do you choose to do what you like to do or do you choose to do what your loved ones expect you to do, when you are successful in both? He also has the dilemma of where does your loyalty stand, with your blood or with your spouse or significant other? Can it be both?There were so many enjoyable characters in this book. Not just the primary ones. There were bits of humor scattered throughout and lots of thought provoking events. I felt so many emotions during the course of this book and that is always a sign of a good book to me. It was descriptive and when I wasn’t listening to it I was looking forward to when I would be again. This book has many amazing reviews and they are very well deserved. I’m very glad I finally got to this one, and I am already missing it. "
215,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5990485-mary,Rating 4 out of 5,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ / 5I listened to the audiobook of The Dutch House by Ann Patchett which was narrated by Tom Hanks and it really just heightened my experience with this book! What it's about: Danny and his older sister Maeve live with their dad on a large estate known to everyone as the Dutch House. Their mom leaves when Danny is young, and the siblings are eventually kicked out of the Dutch House by their stepmom when Danny is a teenager. Set over five decades, The Dutch House focuses on two siblings that can't let go of their past, and the course their lives eventually take. They say the narrator can make or break an audiobook and I definitely agree. I could listen to Tom Hanks all day and I loved that he was the narrator of The Dutch House. He spoke the words with the heart they deserved and emphasized the beauty of this novel. This is my first experience with an Ann Patchett book, and it will definitely not be my last.I saw a couple reviews that mentioned The Dutch House might not be the best book to read first if you are new to Patchett, but I was instantly consumed with the story and all the pain of this family saga. I loved Danny and Maeve even with all of their flaws, and I ended up loathing their stepmom (like any good person would do). Patchett really knows how to move you with her words and characters, and this was a very emotional book. I thought the writing to be both beautiful and eloquent, and I am kicking myself for not reading one of Patchett's books sooner! The Dutch House took me on a journey through Danny and Maeve's lives, and all the pain and heartaches this family endures. There are happy times that made me smile and chuckle as well, so don't worry - this book isn't all just one sad journey! Song/s the book brought to mind: 100 Years by Five for FightingFinal Thought: The Dutch House was my first time listening to a fiction book as an audiobook and I absolutely loved my experience with it. The audio is just shy of 10 hours but the minutes pass quickly and Hanks makes for an excellent narrator. If you are into family sagas with beautiful, descriptive words I highly recommend picking this up ASAP!"

I would not have read it otherwise based on mixed reviews and the cover. After listening, I completely understand the cover and it is the perfect cover. I listened to the Audible version narrated by Tom Hanks who does a masterful and memorable job.If you appreciate literature and have enjoyed books read in literature classes, then I strongly suggest The Dutch House. The house is truly central to the story, and in my opinion, the main character. All of the relationships in the story are viewed through/impacted by the Dutch House. All of the characters are flawed. Each character has aspects I connected with and others that rubbed me wrong. Though it appears Danny is the story teller (and he is not the most observant character), Maeve and the Dutch House permeate every aspect. The Dutch House must be mentioned well over a hundred times, but the time I found most impressive was during The Nutcracker. That scene was absolutely brilliantly written.I loved Danny’s relationship with his father. His father reminded me so very much of my grandfather. Danny wants nothing more than to walk in his father’s footsteps, and he even repeats the same major mistake that his father made. Maeve was the most memorable character for me, but then there’s Fluffy! WOW! The many layers of Fluffy! Who would have thought! Loved the development of this character. No spoilers. Just words. Chemistry. Frozen vegetables. The train. The Painting. The car. Cigarettes. What a powerful story of loss and redemption. Everything comes full circle. Everything was resolved. An impressive literary masterpiece."

I was not disappointed.THE DUTCH HOUSE is told by Danny Conroy, looking back at his life that began in an old mansion that his father had bought to impress his mother, who instead grew embarrassed by its over luxuriousness, eventually choosing to leave her family. Danny and his older sister, Maeve, became wards of a less than loving father and eventually an ambitious step mother. What follows are decades of calamity, uncertainty, close bonds come and gone, with Danny and Maeve always drawn back to the house that made them, forced to wonder why certain events occurred and whether they could forgive the adults who did them wrong.Pratchett is a quiet writer but her pride is elegance and entrancing, the plot shifts subtle but moving. Hanks' narration is pitch perfect, never too dramatic, but with enough depth to capture the emotion of Danny's story.Definitely one of my favourite reads of the year, a perfect gift for parents looking for a book to capture them."

We reminisce with Danny and Maeve about their childhood and let me tell you they reminisce A LOT. I mean a lot, a lot. It’s to the point where Danny’s wife is quite annoyed by it. Nevertheless, we get to know Danny and Maeve quite well and soon their pain becomes our pain, their joy becomes our joy, etc. “There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you’d been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet within place, and for a moment you’re suspended, knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself.”This was my first Ann Patchett book and I plan to read more of her work. Not a fast paced type of a book but very strong character development and a satisfying ending. I listened to the audio version which is narrated by Tom Hanks who did a fantastic job!“But we overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.”"

All three are able to take an everyday life and turn it into a novel. If you need spectacular or uber exciting, this may not be what you are looking for. But if you like life-like, steady and richly written this Patchett novel is for you. I listened to this novel on audio. It was narrated by Tom Hanks and he did a fabulous job of it. His pitch and tone and inflections were great. You could feel the characters some to life under his reading. Two siblings are stuck! Stuck in the time they lived in the Dutch House. This novel moves through five decades and you see the growth of both siblings. The growth, influenced by the Dutch House. We are able to walk through the lives of both Maeve and Danny, seeing it from their perspective, seeing it from the each others perspective and also from the outside by additional characters. Inheritance, loss and disappointment, our appearance to others, our appearance to ourselves, truth and lies, hopeful thinking, and realization of the truth are all themes throughout this novel.As I said, not a flashy novel, just the simmering life of siblings, as they both obsessed over their lives as associated to the Dutch House.

The Dutch House introduces us to a single parent family living in a gigantic historic mansion. The two children, Maeve and Danny, are the focus of this character-driven story which really is about family dynamics and how wealth can impact a family in very unexpected ways. Patchett is so clever in the way in which she reveals her stories. I think she really understands human nature, grudges, forgiveness, and love, and finds a way to reveal the truths behind these emotions to her readers without ever telling them what to think. And I think every reader will find a character or two to relate to in this particular story. If you haven't read this one yet, I highly recommend it. I like an Patchett in general, but I enjoyed this one more than Bel Canto and State of Wonder."

Like Anne Tyler, Patchett manages to make the lives of fairly ordinary people doing fairly ordinary things worth reading about.Patchett’s prose is wonderful: “The madder Maeve got, the more thoughtful she became. In this way she reminded me of our father – every word she spoke came individually wrapped” and “Her wrist looked like ten pencils bundles together”. And that striking cover? It neatly ties the whole thing together, beginning and end. What a wonderful read!!"
231,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5 stars. I very nearly gave it a 5 star review. And it's close, but just not quite there.After some ponder time, I believe this is tied for my most favorite Patchett. And that's saying it's GOOD. I liked State of Wonder as much, but this one is probably more ""universal"" as combined families have been for decades, and are also becoming- the near count majority. It's one of the largest and prime reason that I lived the non-remarriage serial monogamy route. Serial monogamy marriage being closest to ""normal"" since about 1975. In the USA and other places it was even earlier. I've seen too many kids get the shaft from their parent's marriage partner. Worse than this couple of siblings. Marriage laws are, IMHO, intensely unfair- and not only in the inheritance frames either.But Ann Patchett has hit superbly upon the siblings of ""us"" vs ""them"". And defined the Father who walked the oversee line without really ""seeing"" any true essence reality for/ of ""after"" at all.A great siblings story that is probably far outside of median, but purely and supremely nuanced beyond any I think I've read in decades. Also that Mother who thinks of herself (and others seem to agree?) as ""saint fodder"". I think Ann Patchett performed a miracle in positing her as she did. What an impossible task she accomplished to equate her values and her actions in the prose language of subtle flow and calm. I could hardly read about her in any semblance of the same. Of such priorities are the most highly duplicitous and do gooders who gush their superior sensibilities made. Save us from their ""know better than others"" examples and screen us, PLEASE from the fall outs of their values' actions.Andrea is supposed to be the heavy in this one. The wicked step-mother personified? She was a welterweight evil, IMHO. The real Mom was the heavyweight brand! Gag me.Read the book to find out what I'm posting. No more review. Take the crux of this plot without more knowledge.It lost a point in the jumps of ""eyes"" and back-biting time flows. They were too abrupt and put there to cause unknowns to heighten the tension. They weren't needed. Maeve and Dan only need to sit in the vehicle across the street from the Dutch House while smoking their ""last"" cigarette. Sit, talk and smoke; once, once and once again. That was sufficient tension. Constant and lifelong sort of which only those who have lived in it or have seen it up close (like our household help here at the Dutch House) know. Maeve's portrait on the hardcover is GORGEOUS. I do not think at all she looked grim- she looked exactly like Irish girls I have know who are SO trying to be a ""good girl"". Also loved the wall paper."

I grew up in the Ditch House, and Sandy and Jocelyn and Celeste were my family, and nothing else.This book is fantastic. It's easy on the heart and somehow so heavy, so demanding of my emotional abilities and inner self, that there were moments when I, quite literally, couldn't breathe. It's very well written, and the story flows from one chapter to the next, Danny being a reliable and wonderful narrator. (And the audiobook? I hear Tom Hanks is FANTASTIC). Every character was dynamic and compelling in their own way, even The Dutch House itself, deserving of as much attention as any other character due to all the power it exerts over each one of them.This book is also delightful, but not too sappy. A family saga of sorts, it moves through the decades from Danny's point of view, as he tells the story of his life and the house that represented so much to so many.

234,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1654645-deb-readerbuzz-nance,Rating 4 out of 5,"A good writer doesn't need explosions or stabbings or scary monsters to tell a story. A good writer can take a poor family and an old mansion and make a mesmerizing tale of love and loss, of misunderstanding, of struggle and gain, of searching and finding. A good writer can create the family and the mansion and put them together and see what happens. A good writer can take simple things and make a story of great complexity and emotion. Ann Patchett is a good writer. The Dutch House is the story of the Conroy family and their relationships over time with each other and with the mansion, the Dutch House. People do as people do. People give others surprises and the surprises are not what the others want. People leave and offer no explanations for their disappearances. People meet and come together for what appears to be random and unexplainable reasons. In short, The Dutch House is the story of the lives of a few people, unremarkable lives, perhaps, but also lives of depth and fascination. (Oh, and the fact that I listened to this story as an audiobook read by the great Tom Hanks did nothing but add bonus points to my rating of the novel.)I was entranced by this story of a boy and his sister, abandoned by their mother, orphaned by the loss of their father, put out in the world, with the strength of having each other to rely on, with the eventual and inevitable weakness of having only each other to rely on."

Aquele tipo de história simples, sobre relações (neste caso, entre dois irmãos) que costumo adorar 🙌🏼---------------------Demorei um pouco a publicar opinião sobre este livro, porque senti necessidade de refletir sobre ele e de o absorver completamente... Gostei tanto de o ler que está, sem dúvida, entre os melhores do ano!! 😍Danny (o narrador) e Maeve são dois irmãos que vivem numa deslumbrante casa que, outrora, pertenceu a uma família holandesa (daí o título). A casa tem uma presença muito forte, ao longo de todo o livro, e mesmo quando os irmão são expulsos pela madrasta, continua a ter um simbolismo e um papel relevante nas suas vidas.É daqueles livros em que a história não parece ter nada de extraordinário, mas é tão envolvente que é impossível não nos rendermos. Adorei a relação e as dinâmicas familiares (mais do que das personagens em si) e acho que é esta a grande essência da história. A escrita também é maravilhosa. Já tinha lido outro livro da autora, ""Comunidade"", que provocou em mim o mesmo efeito magnético e, definitivamente, Ann Patchett entrou para a lista de autores de quem quero ler tudooo. Vale mesmo a pena! 🥰"

I kept thinking ""Boo-hoo, so your mother left you when you were kids to help the poor and your father was emotionally unavailable and your step mother was mean, get over yourselves"". I'm a big fan of books that explore relationships between siblings but their relationship felt so stagnant and stale.

245,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39272121-marilyn-trying-to-catch-up,Rating 5 out of 5,"I was very excited about reading The Dutch House by Ann Patchett after reading several reviews about it and I was not disappointed in the least. Rather I was hooked right from the start. Ann Patchett's writing was brilliant. She brought to life a version of a Hansel and Gretel with a modern day approach. It was centered around the themes of a loveless childhood, banishment and a very controlling, plotting and cruel step-mother in a most believable way. The Dutch House was about a special bond between siblings, a sister and a brother, the house, the Dutch House, where they grew up and the effects their pasts had on their present day lives. I was able to listen to The Dutch House on Audio CD read by Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks' narration really put it over the top for me. This was definitely my most favorite book by Ann Patchett.Danny and Maeve's father surprised his wife and mother of his children, Elna, with a gift one day. After taking a long drive, the family arrived on the outskirts of Philadelphia at a very unique house. As they pulled up to the house, Cyril (Danny and Maeve's father) told their mother that he had bought The Dutch House for her. When they entered the house Elna's reaction was not exactly what Cyril expected. To Elna, The Dutch House was more of a museum with all its ornate furnishings than a home. Elna never felt comfortable within the walls of the Dutch House. The only room that she felt at ease in was the kitchen. Beside the ""stuffy, ornate furnishings"" Elna was gifted household help. These women became her allies and confidants and for Danny and Maeve they became their ""fairy godmothers"". Cyril was not a warm, loving, fuzzy father. He was strict, successful, and hard-working but lacked the ability to show his love to his own children. Elna had always had the calling of being a nun or helping those in less fortunate circumstances. Living at the Dutch House began to put pressure and discontentment at the forefront of Elna's life. Although she loved her children, this discontentment was too strong for her to ignore. Not long after moving into the Dutch House, Danny and Maeve's mother abandoned them. The two siblings forged a very special bond with each other. Maeve almost took on the role of mother to Danny. Danny relied on his sister completely. Their father retreated into himself even more after their mother's disappearance. Sandy and Jocelyn, the housekeepers, become more involved in Danny and Maeve's day to day lives. Then the very unexpected happened. Cyril brought Andrea home to the Dutch House. From the very beginning Maeve and Danny do not like Andrea but their father seemed to have fallen for her and went along with all her conniving ways. Andrea brought her two daughters to the Dutch House to live with them when Cyril and Andrea got married. The first thing Andrea contrived was to take Maeve's room away from her and give it to one her daughters. Maeve was banished to the attic. Cyril allowed this to happen. Andrea's worst acts were only about to take shape. Neither Maeve nor Danny could have seen these things coming. Andrea was the all encompassing stereotype of the evil step-mother.The Dutch House by Ann Patchett moved me greatly. I was absorbed from the first page and did not want it to end. It was and remains rare to witness a bond so strong between siblings. It was beautiful and yet some may have felt that it was not natural. The house, the Dutch House, held that bond together at its core and would not let go. Even when Danny and Maeve no longer lived there a magnetism from the house pulled at them and brought brother and sister back to it. The Dutch House was told through the voice and memories of Danny. It took place right after World War II and spanned over five decades. The one constant throughout the book was the love that Danny and Maeve shared for one another. I loved the ending. All good things come full circle. I highly recommend The Dutch House by Ann Patchett for all those who have not read it yet.I received a complimentary copy of The Dutch House by Ann Patchett from Harper Collins Publishers through Netgalley. Opinions expressed in this review are completely my own. Thank you Netgalley, Ann Patchett and Harpers Collins Publishers for this opportunity to read The Dutch House."
246,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/109502514-bookmonkey,Rating 3 out of 5,"Rating: 2.75🍌Like the majority of contemporary American literary fiction, you can be pretty confident that you know what you're getting into with an Ann Patchett novel: polished if unassuming prose, an immersive character-driven narrative, and a plot arc punctuated by poignant moments that resolve into an equally poignant conclusion. These traits are largely on display again here in THE DUTCH HOUSE, a Pulitzer Prize finalist that traces the dissolution of the Conroy family vis a vis the eponymous home they once lived in. Cyril Conroy is a self-made real estate baron who, shortly after WWII, purchases a Pennsylvania mansion known as the Dutch House as a gift for his wife, Elna. When the novel opens, though, Elna is out of the picture -- the mystery of why she left the family is not immediately revealed -- and we learn that Cyril is now a single father who largely leaves the raising of his children, Maeve and her younger brother Danny, to his servants.The novel is told through the retrospective perspective of Danny, who grows up in the shadow of his mother's absence and the larger crisis that occurs when his father marries Andrea, a young mother of two with an unhealthy obsession with the Dutch House itself. We follow Danny as he goes away to boarding school, attends Columbia for university and med school, gets married to Celeste and has kids while embarking on his own real estate business. The story of Danny's life events is not especially compelling -- he’s another self-absorbed white guy capitalist -- but Patchett employs an interesting chronological structure to texture it just enough to keep you going. What really drives the book is Danny's relationship with Maeve, who took on a maternal role for her younger brother after their mother left; the relationship between the siblings is largely forged through the crucible of their memories/relationship to their parents and the house in which they grew up. Indeed, their touching and well-wrought relationship was the only thing that kept me reading to the end of the book, which loses steam and direction after a very engaging first third. The major problem with THE DUTCH HOUSE is the lack of texture and dimension to the characters and their relationships. Andrea, the stepmother, is an over-the-top witch without a shred of empathy; Celeste and Maeve hate each other for absurd reasons; the father -- a war veteran and real estate mogul -- is an irredeemable wimp who refuses to stand up for his children; the oft-repeated explanation for Elna abandoning the family is unbelievable. Even Maeve and Danny's relationship, by far the strongest element of the book, begins to feel a bit flat and repetitive by the end of it. Because Ann Patchett is an accomplished writer, I tried to convince myself that this was on purpose, perhaps as part of an intended fairy tale structure -- the enchanted house in the woods, the wicked stepmother, and, if that wasn't clear enough, at one point Celeste even complains to Danny that he and Maeve are ""like Hansel and Gretel"" -- but if this was the intention it requires too much generosity from at least this reader to work. Yet Patchett manages to pull it together enough to deliver an ending that evokes genuine emotion, tying the characters and plot threads from throughout the novel into a (perhaps too) tidy conclusion. I’m just not sure whether it’s worth reading 350+ pages to get there."
247,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2592286-kerry,Rating 5 out of 5,"The worse thing about reading a five star book is--you can only read it for the first time once. I was sad to finish this book but I have to say the last 1/4 are what sealed the deal for me. I love Patchett's books, have read them all and wait expectantly for the next. Still some reads are better than others. It is hard to put my finger on exactly why this one was a home run for me. The story is about too siblings, older sister, younger brother (he tells the story) who weather several storms together and are very close. Their mother leaves the family when the younger is 4 and the older sister is 12. Father who is building owner (rentals apt. buildings in NYC) eventually remarries and the new wife (with two young girls of her own) is less than kind to her step children. How this effects their lives going forward is the meat of the story. Patchett has written about combined families previously--most recently in Commonwealth-- and it is a theme she is drawn to in her stories. I've heard reviews saying the Dutch House is like a character in this story--I did not feel that. The house provides a context but actually I found it played less of a part than I expected. That said I did not love this book till near the end. I did listen to it on audio as I do at least half of my reading--and I must say as much as I love Tom Hanks I felt he was not the best choice for the narration. It was not his reading (in that he was exceptional) it was the fact that his voice goes with his face and the story is being told by a young boy in the early stages and knowing Hanks age and looks it really drew me away from seeing this central character in my mind. Would have loved a great reader without the baggage of being a known famous person who doesn't quite fit with the book's described narrator. That said the book felt a little whiney to me at first but these characters are so well drawn and the story while it has few revelations is so well told and has such a great ending I know I will be drawn to read it (in print form) soon again. I could gush and try to pin point why it was so good but if you love family dramas and character driven stories don't let this one pass you by. I envy you your first reading. Hope you find it as engaging as I did."

In  The Dutch House  we meet Cyril Conroy, who through the luck and some real estate knowledge came into great wealth. Through this new found wealth Cyril was able to purchase The Dutch House which was previously owned by a Dutch family who came to ruin. Cyril purchased this sprawling mansion in the countryside of Philadelphia as a surprise for his wife- this began the down fall of the Conroy family. The book is told from the perspective of Cyril's youngest son, Danny. Danny gives us an in-depth look into his relationship with his older sister Maeve and what becomes of The Dutch House and those who lived and worked in the house. A five decade long narration that will keep you utterly enthralled the entire way. The Dutch House is the grounding point of the book because this is where all the relationships, conflicts and problems arises. From the housekeeper being thrown out, to the Danny and Maeve being told to leave with just their clothes and no inheritance to speak of... but this is where the story begins. I absolutely loved this book. Ann Patchett did an amazing job of showcasing sibling relationships, mother daughter-son relationships, sainthood and forgiveness. The characters were well formed, you knew exactly who Maeve and Danny were and their character motivation. Reading this book will have you rooting for these siblings. The book goes between the present, the past and the in-between so seamlessly and this is a testimony to Patchett's writing. There is this suspense that keeps building because of the unanswered questions- but everything comes together in the most organic and beautiful way. If you love family drama this is your pick. If you are looking for a truly heart warming sibling relationship- this is it. If you are a fan of Ann Patchett- just know she delivers with The Dutch House. Highly recommend- I am still nursing my this hangover"

Accanto alla casa olandese vi è una protagonista femminile, Maeve Conroy, il cui destino è indissolubilmente legato a quella casa in cui la sua famiglia si trasferì quando suo padre Cyril improvvisamente divenne ricco grazie a giusti investimenti immobiliari: la casa olandese ha visto, impassibile e fredda nella sua eleganza e sfarzosità, il disfarsi di una famiglia, devastata dalla fuga della madre di Maeve e di Danny, il narratore, il fratello minore legato ossessivamente alla sorella. Quanto accaduto all’interno di quelle mura superbe e bellissime ha segnato l’esistenza dei protagonisti del romanzo, che per questo motivo ne sono rimasti avvinti come da un incantesimo, tanto che, per anni, dopo che da quella casa sono stati cacciati via, i due fratelli torneranno abitualmente a sostare, nascosti all’interno della loro macchina, di fronte alla maestosa costruzione, per spiarne le luci e le ombre, per ricordare un’infanzia triste e dolorosa, per non dimenticare l’abbandono, ma anche per consolarsi del dolore patito insieme abbandonando il passato per tuffarsi in un futuro che sempre ha le sue radici in esso.Un romanzo particolare, sia nella scrittura, con continui salti temporali, che nella narrazione, asciutta, che non cade mai nel sentimentalismo tanto da far pensare a una freddezza di fondo dei personaggi, che vivono emozioni profonde senza che la scrittrice calchi la mano. A volte mi ha lasciato sconcertata, però la lettura è risultata nel complesso piacevole e coinvolgente."
250,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/74844479-wyndy,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5 stars.‘The Dutch House’ is my sixth novel by Ann Patchett and frankly one of my least favorites. This book started out so strong with Maeve Conroy and younger brother Danny soldiering through the desertion of their mother Elna, the aloofness of their father Cyril, and the life-changing second marriage of their father to a truly sinister woman named Andrea who adds her two young daughters to the mix. I enjoyed the stories about the history of the Dutch House and its former owners, and the early days of Maeve and Danny’s parents’ relationship, and Cyril Conroy’s rise to success in real estate, stories mostly shared by “the help” at the Dutch House - Fluffy, Jocelyn and Sandy. These loyal, hard-working women were the threads that bound all the characters in this book together. What I did not like: The changes in timeline within the chapters was confusing and eventually annoying. The “stalking” of the Dutch House by Maeve and Danny for years and years became tiresome. The waste of such huge sums of money on Danny’s education was unconscionable (yes, I understand why, but still . . .). And Part Three was unrealistic and almost Hallmark-hokey for me. But then again, I’m a pretty unsentimental person. I will continue to read anything Ann Patchett writes because she is an outstanding author. I just didn’t love this particular novel like most readers did.“But we overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.”~ Danny Conroy"

Bel Canto and State of Wonder are two of my top reads ever. And The Dutch House didn't disappoint. The relationship between siblings Maeve and Danny is so intense and intertwined. They're quirky and funny and good for each other and not (reminiscent of many Anne Tyler characters). It's an amazing thing for a writer to create a relationship so believable in the context of the novel yet so unlike anyone the reader personally knows. Maeve nor Danny are perfectly flawed, and they know it. They're trying so hard to make things okay for each other that they make gigantic mistakes during the course of their 50+ years together. The book slowed down during the last 70 pages (is it okay to admit I skimmed those?), but overall, it's a lovely read. We are so lucky to have Patchett among us."
252,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56111743-roman-clodia,Rating 3 out of 5,"This is a kind of superior family soap opera with the necessary dysfunctional family, secrets and memories, and a house which is a character in its own right - sound familiar? Well yes, me too. A bit realistic fairy-tale (the wicked stepmother, Hansel & Gretel), where this scores is in the characterisation, especially of Maeve, part sister, part maternal figure to the narrator. I'd say this will appeal to readers wanting a traditional family story. For me, I found it frustrating that no-one could get beyond the past with this constant circling back to what has gone before. The writing is unobtrusive, plain and simple prose, nothing inventive. An undemanding read but with a tangible sense of warmth and love between the brother and sister protagonists."

I loved her writing and her characters. I was able to be absorbed by the story and was engaged the entire time. This book really made me think about kindness and forgiveness. There were a couple of characters that I honestly felt were incredibly selfish and some of the other characters were very forgiving of and caring towards them.

Together with his older sister, Maeve, they have a fairly idyllic childhood at first - Cyril has a profitable property business, renovating and renting out old properties, and the family have three servants who are more like friends of the family: a nanny they call Fluffy, and sisters Jocelyn and Sandy, housekeeper and cook respectively. All goes well for the children until their mother leaves - and worse is to come a few years later when Andrea, the wicked stepmother, arrives with her own two children....I wasn't sure if I was going to enjoy this one before I started to read it - I have enjoyed other works by this author but one or two not so much - and the cover was not encouraging (It actually transpires that the cover is a representation of a portrait of Danny's older sister Maeve which features quite prominently in the book). Nonetheless, as with Bel Canto, I was soon hooked by the storyline and the way the tale was narrated. The children's relationship with their stepmother and the outcome of that was quite shocking and the ongoing tale of the pair's relationship with one another was engrossing. The house itself was a major character in the book, in particular the love/hate relationship each character had with the house. Overall, a really good read - 8.5/10. "
258,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36193941-tanzila-tabassum-zisha-annabel-lee,Rating 4 out of 5,"Nominee for the 2020 Pulitzer Prize for fiction. This is a complex and impressive family drama/ historical fiction revolving around The Dutch House. The house that becomes a character itself, that decides the actions of the characters throughout their lives as they find themselves coming back to its doorsteps again and again. Prepare to feel yourself crushed under nostalgia and melancholy when you read this. Even though the writing isn't manipulative, Danny's gloomy reminiscence is enough to cast a shadow over the reader's heart. The story is mainly focused on Maeve and Danny and their sibling relationship - the bond that sprouts from sharing a mother that abandoned them and a distant, lonely father. The bond that goes through the fire of being evicted from their own inheritance, and strengthens. It's about an evil stepmother straight out of the pages of a fairy-tale. All basic elements, twisted in their heads just a little. It follows the sublings, Danny and Maeve, throughout their lives as they keep going back to the house, park in the street in front of it, and think back on various incidents in their lives. Intermittently, we see those incidents playing out in flashback.At one point, they realize how they wasted all those times sitting outside the house, holding onto the hatred for a life that would never be theirs again. 
“Just imagine if she’d come to get the paper sooner,” she said. “Say, twenty years ago.” “We could have had our lives back.” 
Sometimes forgiveness is unbearable. Especially when one finds themselves wronged by someone who is family. Maeve finds herself unable to forgive her stepmother, just as Danny can't accept their own mother's return, each getting resentful of the other's intolerance. Something I found interesting is that all of the characters - however benevolent or compassionate - had a streak of cruelty to them, and for good reasons. There was no character that could be purely blamed as a villain. I liked the first portion of the book better. I loved their formative years and sibling interactions. After they got older and especially after their mother came back  I started feeling disconnected from the story and the characters apart from Maeve. To be honest, I just didn't want to continue reading after  Maeve died. That was where the book ended for me. Maeve was indisputably my favorite in the whole set of nuanced, realistic characters. Her wasted brilliance, her sisterly affection, kindness, anger - all of it cemented her place in my heart as one of my most cherished female characters.Throughout the book, we see many times references to Maeve's red coat. Though I was sure she didn't wear the same coat all her life, it felt odd that she'd always wear red. And then after reading the part where she was recounting the days when her painting was being done, I saw the connection - that it was because Simon told her to. This was such a nice little touch. A lot can be said about this book. It's really what you'd call a multifaceted story. Each of the characters had their own reasons to act in a certain way, maybe that way was a mistake, but who doesn't make mistakes? Reading this book made me feel like being wrapped in a blanket of homesickness. At some parts I just had to put down the book and drift back to my own childhood. 
“I remember at night we’d turn out the lights and bring a lamp into the bedroom closet, and push out the shoes so we could sit on the floor and read. Dad was on air raid patrol. You had to pull up your knees so you could fit and then I’d come in behind you and sit in your lap.”""We had changed at whatever point the old homestead had become the car: the Oldsmobile, the Volkswagen, the two Volvos. Our memories were stored on VanHoebeek Street, but they weren’t in the Dutch House anymore. If someone had asked me to tell them very specifically where I was from, I would have to say I was from that strip of asphalt in front of what had been the Buchsbaums’ house, which had then become the Schultzes’ house, and was now the house of people whose names I didn’t know.""“Do you think it’s possible to ever see the past as it actually was?”""There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you’d been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet in place, and for a moment you’re suspended, knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself.""
On another note, I was excited to see that the audiobook narrator was Tom Hanks. But as much as I love this guy's acting I didn't love his narration."

Then at age fifteen, after his father dies unexpectedly, his step-mother-from-hell kicks him out of the house. His older sister then fills the psychological role of mother in his life, but when the long-ago-disappeared biological mother shows up after forty years and his older sister is more interested in visiting with her than with him it is experienced as another loss. The drama of lost mothers is supplemented with the haunting memories of the big house that our protagonist was forced to leave as a fifteen-year-old. As one would expect from the book's title, the house becomes very real by the end of the book.One question I asked myself as reader was what sort of mother leaves a family of two children ages 3 and 10 with zero contact for over forty years? And when she reappears we learn that she has spent her life being a saint serving the poor. Serving the poor is an admirable then to do, but cutting off a relationship with your children to do so? The book's narrative does remind readers that throughout history there have been many men who have abandoned their children--some of whom were thought of as being great men.The portrayal of the step mother in this book must be a modern day recreation of a character from Charles Dickens. Some step-mothers are wonderful parents and love their step children, but not in this book. The older sister in this book has type 1 diabetes, and the story contains one vignette when the blood sugar is out of balance. This segment of the story can serve as an educational experience to readers like me who have limited knowledge of what diabetics have to deal with.The above mentioned items and many others are combined to provide the readers with an interesting and compelling reading experience. I enjoyed the book very much."

I loved the characters even though I wanted to slap all of them at some point. I was worried for a good portion of the book that there wouldn't be a resolution, that it would just sort of drift into a ending, the way the lives of the main characters were currently drifting, but Patchett very skillfully steered this story into a resolution that was both unexpected and yet perfect. Also, Tom Hanks reads this audiobook. It was amazing. He was perfect for it. Warm and funny and very Tom Hanksian. He didn't do the women's voices in a high, wispy voice or anything weird or condescending, as male readers sometimes do. He read the chapter headings with various levels of exuberance which was just . . . so Tom Hanks!And listen, I want to post a bit of a spoiler, without marking the whole review as a spoiler. I just have to get something off my chest, but I don't want to alter anyone else's experience. So if you haven't read the book yet, look away now.We good?Okay.*deep breath*Celeste was a spiteful, unrelenting bitch and I can't believe she spent so many years making Maeve into a villain just because she didn't always get what she wanted, when she wanted it. Would she really have been happy being married to a medical student and then a newly licensed doctor, or would she have bitched about him being gone all the time then, too? Or not having enough money? I really, really hated her.Thank you, I had to say that."

I'm shocked by my reaction to The Dutch House because I've read Patchett's novels (Bel Canto is a favorite) and much of her nonfiction, and I greatly admire her as a writer, and maybe I'm missing something here, but this novel that I was fully expecting to love, I don't. I found it only partially interesting and rarely compelling, and it missed for me at both the story and sentence levels. Family angst, yes, but everything felt at a remove. Why was Andrea as she was? Why the great animosity between Maeve and Celeste when they started out liking each other? Why was Cyril so bland? And the Dutch House itself, yes, it figures, but not in a way that made me care about it even an iota. The structure was somewhat interesting, as were two points made very late in the book and touched on only briefly: the truth that men are often congratulated for leaving their families while women are not, and the notion that families of saints don't particularly like their sainted family members. I'm very sad that The Dutch House left me mostly cold."

There is no alien invasion, there is no dystopian reality, no love triangles, no one is trying to take over anything. This is the story of a family and a house and how the decisions taken inside that house affect all people that live there and how it keeps affecting them all thought their lives. The main characters are a pair of sister and brother. You could argue that the Dutch house is a character too because it always looms in the back permeating all of the main characters decisions. I love the normalcy of this novel after reading so many books in different genres. While this was a good novel I still don’t understand why this book had over a 100 holds in the library I work at. Nonetheless I do recommend this novel to anyone looking for a bit of normalcy in these times of upheavals and pandemics. "

For the Conroy children, Danny and Maeve, the hardest thing to accept is the loss of their family home, the Dutch House. The capper on top of their many losses and the one that seems the most unfair. But at least they still have each other. Patchett examines how this closeness affects their lives and the choices they make as they grow into adults, but somehow still cling to their attachment to that house. Can they ever move on? Forgive and forget? A good, satisfying read from a master storyteller."

The titular house is a character in this book, and is fully realized. 50 years of sibling camraderie, love, loss, ne'er do well step mother drama, and forgiveness was not enough.

Themes of forgiveness, compassion, and family are strong throughout and this is a difficult novel to put down. 7/10Summary: The Dutch House is the story of two siblings, Maeve and Danny Conroy and their lives over several decades. The two are inseparable, bonded very tightly after their mother leaves home when they're very you. The Dutch House is their home, a 1922 mansion outside Philadelphia that their father, Cyril, a real estate mogul, bought fully furnished in an estate sale as a surprise for his wife. His wife hates everything about the house and flees to India to dedicate her life to the poor. Cyril remarries and there is a strained relationship between the stepmother and Maeve and Danny. The story follows their lives for over fifty years.The Good: I listened to this book as narrated by Tom Hanks and it was amazing. Probably the best audiobook I have listened to and he was the perfect voice for Danny's character. This novel reads almost like a modern day fairytale; it reminded me a lot of Hansel and Gretel. The characters are very well developed with lots of unique personality and the writing is wonderful throughout. Some suspense and sharp turns along the way and I had a hard time putting this one down.The Bad: There was a plot throughout but at the end I found myself wishing for more. I thought there would be a twist, some major surprise, or just a bit more plot so felt slightly let down when I finished. And though I felt like I got to know all the characters very well, I did not particularly love any of them.Favorite Quotes: ""Do you think it's possible to ever see the past as it actually was?"" “There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you'd been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet in place, and for a moment you're suspended knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself.” “But we overlay the present onto the past. We look back through the lens of what we know now, so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.” "

Anna Gralak) to miejscami wzruszająca, chwilami brutalna bajka, wspaniała opowieść i doskonała lektura.""Wszyscy w Elkins Park wiedzieli, co się dzieje w Domu Holendrów"", pisze Danny, narrator nowej powieści Ann Patchett. Znajdujący się na przedmieściach Filadelfii, Elkins Park na początku XX wieku stał się popularną miejscówką wśród biznesowej elity stolicy Pennsylwanii. Olbrzymie domy, jak neoklascysyyczny Lynnewood Hall z ponad setką pokoi robią wrażenie, choć też dają do myślenia o tym, jak kształtowały się gusta amerykańskiej klasy wyższej. Bardzo ważna dla nich było znalezienie swojego miejsca na ziemii, które będzie odwoływało się do ""wielkiej"" historii, stąd zamiłowanie do klasycyzujący form ale też nawiązań do stylu Tudorów, czy holenderskiego stylu kolonialnego, ale też pokazujące, że świat się zmienił, przez co domy te często pełne były najnowocześniejszych sprzętów i rozwiązań.Dom Holendrów zawdzięczał swoją nazwę jednak właścicielom, “Holendrom z niemożliwym do wymówienia nazwiskiem”. Ukończono go w 1922 roku. Siedem lat później ""bankierzy zaczęli wyskakiwać przez okno"".Tuż po II wojnie światowej posiadłość pełną stylizowanych na flamandzkie portretów rodziny VanHoebeeków kupuje Cyril Conroy, potentat na rynku nieruchomości, człowiek o niezbyt rozbuchanej emocjonalności. Jego pasji do Domu nie podziela Elna, żona Cyrila. Dwójka dzieci, Maeve i młodszy od niej o siedem lat Danny, choć wychowani w tej zaskakującej posiadłości, też mają do niej stosunek dość krytyczny, zwłaszcza, że nie mogą przyjmować szkolnych przyjaciół. Co nie znaczy, że nie jest to ich dom, centrum świata, axis mundi.To mógłby być bardzo przewidywalny dramat rodzinny, może z jakimś rozwodem w środku, zabraniem dzieci od ojca, tułaczką po mniej okazałych rezydencjach, dramatem zdradzonej żony, dzieci wychowywanych bez ojca, ale nie jest. To Elna zostawi rodzinę, dzieci i postanowi wyruszyć w świat. Przez długi czas osoby czytające książkę Patchett nie będą wiedzieć ani gdzie się podziała, ani jakie były przyczyny porzucenia przez nią rodzinnego chłodku. Matka marnotrawna, której odruchowo zaczynamy kibicować.Po kilku latach do Domu Holendrów i życia Cyrila wprowadza się Andrea z dwójką swoich dzieci. Maeva i Danny muszą zająć się sobą, a raczej to Maeva musi zastąpić matkę Danny'emu. Dorastają, idą na studia, ojciec umiera, a Andrea przejmuje władzę absolutną nad rodzinną rezydencją. “Każda oglądana z dystansu konfiguracja luksusu wydawała mi się oknem z widokiem na moje dzieciństwo” pisze Danny oglądając “Dziadka do orzechów” w jednej z najlepszych scen tej książki.Zachwycające jest to jak Pattchett opowiada historię Conroyów i ""Domu Holendrów"", nie spiesząc się, powoli buduje napięcie, szczegółowo opisując relacje między bohaterami, pokazując ich emocje i dojrzewanie. Grają tu zarówno oczywiste symbole jak portrety holenderskiej rodziny wiszące na ścianach, czy “W kleszczach lęku” Henry’ego Jamesa (w przekładzie Jacka Dehnela, “Dokręcanie śruby”) czytane przez Maeve, która była miłośniczką angielskiego pisarza.Patchett umiejętnie buduje portrety postaci drugoplanowych, wprowadza je w doskonale wybranych momentach, a to jak precyzyjnie komponuje książkę przypomina dzieła Fitzgeralda. Nie da się pewnych skojarzeń też uniknąć, bo zarówno autor ""Wielkiego Gatsby'ego"" jak i amerykańska pisarka piszą o kryzysach etyki w zamożnej, nowej klasie mieszczańskiej. Patchett również niezwykle inteligentnie nawiązuje do amerykańskiej i brytyjskiej prozy opowiadającej o dzieciństwie, ale mit, który buduje nie jest tkliwy, nostalgiczny. Nie przypomina “Małej księżniczki”, a raczej historię znaną z “O czym wiedziała Maisie” Jamesa, powieści może niezbyt udanej ale będącej dla pisarza ćwiczeniem w pisaniu z dziecięcej perspektywy.To proza konkretna, twardo stąpająca po ziemi. Nie ma u Patchett tandeciarstwa emocjonalnego, nikt nam nie karze rozpaczać nad upadkiem domu bogatych białych ludzi, nie prosi o litość, a pokazuje mechanizmy które za tym stoją. Jest tylko jeden irytujący swoim banałem moment - gdy Andrea po śmierci męża i ojca dwójki głównych bohaterów przejmuje dom i finanse Conroyów, okazuje się, że dla Danny’ego przeznaczony jest fundusz na studia, którego Andrea nie może ruszyć. Patchett nie pozwala swoim bohaterom upaść zbyt nisko w hierarchii społecznej. Samo rozwiązanie narracyjnie jest dość prostackie, ale jakoś to trzeba było wyjaśnić.Patchett opisuje życie ludzi bez zbędnych emocji, na spokojnie, powoli budując dramat. Jest to powieść, która przywodzi na myśl holenderskiego malarstwo, bo z precyzją, światłem jak u flamandzkich mistrzów, którzy lekkie sceny rodzajowe przerabiali na wielkie symboliczne opowieści. Elkins Park wkracza do literatury i zapewne stanie się celem wycieczek fanów i fanek “Domu Holendrów”. Patchett zaś pokazuje się nam jako współczesna klasyczka, doskonale łącząca tradycyjną powieść, przewrotną bajkę z nowoczesną narracją, która pozwala bohaterom, a zwłaszcza bohaterkom robić rzeczy, których do tej pory nie mogli robić.Bardzo podoba mi się fakt, że wydawca nie poszedł po taniości i książkę wydaje w twardej oprawie, większym formacie i dobranej kolorystycznie kapitałce, bo to jest książka, którą warto traktować trochę lepiej. Polecam Państwu."

La Casa Holandesa es una mansión construida en 1922 por una antigua y rica familia holandesa que cuando cae en desgracia y se arruina, es comprada con todo lo que hay dentro por Cyril Conroy como sorpresa para su esposa. Los Conroy habían sido pobres hasta que Cyril empezó a hacer dinero con la compraventa de edificios, así que la casa es una especie de simbolo de estos nuevos tiempos de riqueza para él. Sin embargo, su mujer, Elna, con una mentalidad completamente diferente, no es capaz de acostumbrarse a esta nueva riqueza, a esta casa que la supera estéticamente y no puede entender que con tanta pobreza haya gente capaz de vivir en un lugar tan ostentoso, así que muy pronto abandona a su marido y sus dos hijos pequeños, Maeve y Danny dejándoles en la casa holandesa.""Cuando se presentaron en la Casa Holandesa aquel primer dia, se creían gente pobre. Ella lo obligó a contarle como había conseguido el dinero. Lo obligó, de verdad. Estaba convencida de que había hecho algo ilegal. En esa época nadie tenía esa cantidad de dinero"".Este impactante abandono de Elna a su familia, es lo que marca el resto de la novela. Los niños crecen en un principio en un ambiente cálido pero la ausencia de su madre les marcará ya definitivamente porque una especie de misterio o interrogación define sus vidas...¿porqué si eran una familia feliz, su madre los abandona??? La figura de Elna, ausente durante casi toda la novela, es también al mismo tiempo un personaje siempre presente, nada invisible, porque continuamente se la está nombrando. La novela está contada desde el punto de vista de Danny, el hijo menor, testigo de todo lo que ocurre en la casa, sin embargo el personaje que en mi opinión marca toda la novela, el personaje guia es Maeve, la hermana mayor, que inmediatamente después de la marcha de la madre, se convierte en la madre de su hermano cuando es casi una niña todavia. Maeve es luminosa, responsable, como un faro guía que marcará para siempre la vida de Danny. ""Se lo debí decir a tu padre como cien veces; que Maeve se corte el pelo. Pero no me hacía caso. Le daba igual. Yo siempre he querido que lo supieras, por tu propio bien. Llevas un pelo espantoso. Él no me lo permitió nunca. Siempre decía que era tu pelo, y punto"".Pasado, presente y futuro se yuxtaponen una y otra vez bajo la visión de Danny de los acontecimientos de su vida, que como he dicho antes, es contada como un cuento: los niños huérfanos de madre, la madrastra mala malísima, los niños desterrados..., un sinfín de acontecimientos siempre contados con esa elegancia nada dramática ni sentimentaloide de Ann Patchett. Es una novela espectacular en ese sentido porque el lector se ve inmerso en una historia perfectamente organizada, e incluso los momentos más devastadores son los más luminosos, dónde la presencia de Maeve es un pilar majestuoso. Admito que es un personaje femenino que me ha impactado y maravillado. La Casa Holandesa es un edificio que ha significado diferentes etapas en las vidas de quienes la han habitado pero a los niños Conroy los ha marcado obsesivamente y hay maravillosos momentos en torno a la casa evocados por los hermanos una vez que no viven en ella, porque no pueden olvidarla en el sentido de que los momentos más tristes y más felices de su infancia se encuentran enquistados en la memoria de Danny y Maeve a través de esa casa. ""Si alguien me hubiera preguntado antes de aquella cita cuáles eran mis sentimientos al respecto de mi madre, le habría jurado que ninguno en especial. Me costaba entender la enormidad de mi ira"".Me encanta Ann Patchett; es una escritora cuya escritura fluye casi sin esfuerzo para el lector, tan sútil y etérea en lo que cuenta, hace fácil lo más complejo.Y qué bien habla de los lazos emocionales, de los traumas de infancia y de como superar esas marcas del pasado. Me ha recordado mucho a El jilguero de Donna Tartt, porque toca todos estos temas y porque son dos novelas que me han emocionado muchísimo.""Yo, sin embargo, no podía dejar de pensar en el retrato al óleo de Maeve, colgado en el salón, sin que ninguno de los dos viviéramos en aquella casa. Maeve aparecía en el cuadro con diez años de edad y abrigo rojo, una mirada directa e inteligente y la negra melena suelta""."

Family drama with high octane emotions spilled all across the pages. Extremely likeable characters who have strong filial ties, and a sad poignant ending that as a kid I would have bawled my eyes over. Well then what’s the problem you ask?The problem simply is that I’m no longer 18! At a time when my understanding of emotions has catapulted from the highest gamut to the lowest abyss, I look at relationships a bit differently! With the cynical side eye of maturity behind me, I don’t feel as easily moved at 29..The Dutch house has a Hansel and Gretel vibe to it, with an overprotective older sister, an adoring younger brother, an evil step mother and a helpless rather pathetic sorry excuse of a father. The evil step mother wants all the money, and The fantastic mystical palace (in this case The Dutch house), but she wants nothing to do with the by products of her husbands first marriage. Sounds familiar doesn’t it? That’s because it really is! An ode to the fairy tales we listened to as kids, with unwavering attention, wrapped in a cozy quilt, secure in the knowledge that none of the vile could possibly touch us, that we are loved, wanted and safe.The Dutch house is a breezy invite into those cozy nights of your past. Fantastical yes. Memorable? I doubt it!"
276,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54033599-will,Rating 5 out of 5,"Within an hour of finishing The Dutch House I received the NYT Book Review with a front cover review of the book. Perfect timing and an excellent assessment of the novel. However, as I was putting my thoughts together here, I worried about appropriating ideas from that review (since I agreed overall and it was so fresh in my mind). Therefore, I’ll stick to the basics.I’ve been reading Ann Patchett for many years, going back to her debut novel The Patron Saint of Liars, which I received as a gift (a thoughtful one indeed). She immediately became an author to watch and after these many years has always been a pleasure to read. I have rarely been disappointed and certainly not with this new one. Patchett is not unlike many of her contemporaries (McDermott, Strout, Kingsolver, etc.) in that she isn’t a ‘flashy’ writer. Her writing feels effortless, honest, grounded; lovely, solid prose that lures the reader in with story and believable characters. Characters are, in fact, her real strength - three dimensional, rarely stereotypes. She makes you care about her protagonists and this new novel is no exception with its depiction of the bond between a brother and sister from childhood to middle age. I could quibble over a plot turn in the later part of the novel, but, again, it was such a pleasure to read that it didn't alter the overall experience for me. Might I add - a beautiful jacket cover."
277,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76100631-holly-r-w,Rating 5 out of 5,"""The Dutch House"" is a wonderful book. At the heart of it is the relationship between an older sister and her brother, Maeve and Danny Conroy. As children, their mother (Elna) left them. Maeve was 10 years old at the time. Danny was about 2 years old, so young that he could barely remember Elna as he grew older. For all intents and purposes, Maeve became both a sister and a mother to Danny. Their father, Cyril Conroy, was a self-made business man, who became wealthy through real estate. Buying, selling and rehabbing buildings excited him. In a romantic gesture, he bought an elegant mansion for his young wife Elna. The house had belonged to a wealthy Dutch family. Unfortunately, the modest Elna hated the house on sight, thinking it to be too lavish. She was more comfortable helping the nuns run a food pantry. Cyril could not understand Elna's distaste for the house. Throughout the book, the house takes on various meanings for all of the characters. It plays a major role in the story. As the story unfolds, we watch Maeve and Danny grow up. Maeve chooses not to marry and Danny becomes a husband and father. There is tension between Maeve and Danny's wife, Celeste. I will stop explaining the plot further. I loved how the author gave us such rich characters to think about in a story that is so engrossing. I appreciated how seamlessly she told the story. Her writing flowed so naturally. This is one of my favorite books read this year."
278,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3574699-jennifer-lane,Rating 5 out of 5,"Touching Family DramaI love stories that dive deep into family function and dysfunction, and this novel is one of the best. The narration by Tom Hanks adds humor and depth to the sibling story.Danny grew up without a mother, but his older sister, Maeve, filled that role beautifully. Maeve is one of my favorite characters: strong, sarcastic, sacrificial, smart--just so real. Many of the characters, including the house, feature layers of emotional wounds and believable motivations. It may seem appalling for Danny to endure the difficulty of medical school, then choose a different career path, but the author's nuanced explanation makes that choice seem like the only one that makes sense. Danny and Maeve are such lovable, accessible heroes that it's a pleasure to observe their journeys through life.However, I do not accept the choices made by Danny's mother and stepmother. I don't have children, but I can't imagine leaving your children in order to care for the masses. How about trying harder to resolve a disagreement with your husband before abandoning your family? There's a level of narcissism in that decision that is hard to forgive. I also want to know what motivated Andrea's cruelty. She's a wonderful villain but her backstory is lacking. I have to admit that the unsettled feelings these characters elicit are part of the charm and conflict of the story.A deeply satisfying exploration of family, love, letting go, and inviting in."

I think when you're a child, it most certainly represents ""home"" and that is what the Dutch House was to Maeve and Danny Conroy. It was a beautiful house - more than a house, it was a mansion outside of Philadelphia, a very special place indeed. And then, like getting a rug pulled from beneath their feet, it was taken away from them. It was unimaginable to them how suddenly everything changed.My family did not live in a mansion by any stretch of the imagination. It was a 1400 sq ft house in a suburb of Los Angeles. But it was home and we loved that house. We didn't talk about it the way Maeve and Danny did, but throughout our adult years there were references to the house at 708. And so, on one level - the love of how a house represented love and home - I could relate to them. The story of their lives is told through reminiscence and sharing of memories. As in any family, some stories are known by one member and not by another. This is told in the first person by Danny. We know what he experienced first hand and what he is told. The story is not chronological by any means. Sometimes the time shift isn't obvious and I would go back and read a couple of sentences for it to make sense. In another author's hands, this might not work, but Patchett handles it beautifully. I loved this book from the first pages. The story never flagged, the narrative never weakened. How could I not give it 5-stars?"

I often have eyes pointed somewhere but my head is only seeing the thoughts churning behind my eyeballs. Thus it was that I listened to this audio book thinking how much the narrator sounded like Tom Hanks, only to discover at the end that it was, indeed, him. Forehead slap. His narration was like listening to someone reading a script, complete with all the changes of intonation, pace and volume that adds an enjoyable dimension to the experience. I suppose it doesn't hurt that I like Tom Hanks. I can say he read me to sleep now. Well, maybe that's a stretch. :)I enjoy novels that focus on all the messiness of human relationships, especially family ones, and this story was all about that. Yes, it's been done lots of times and ways, but I still found this an interesting read, with characters who struggle to understand and free themselves from early influences--made more difficult when critical information is missing or distorted. A novel where each main character pursues his/her own needs to the detriment of others, it raises questions about how to balance our needs with the needs of others, and how additional maturation and understanding can change how something affects you.Overall an enjoyable book, just not a great one, in terms of what catches my fancy."
281,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2475858-sharyl,Rating 4 out of 5,"Ann Patchett always tells a good story. This latest novel seemed shorter than usual, but did not lack for interesting characters and situations.The protagonist and narrator is Danny, who is recounting his difficult and unusual childhood, including his intensely close relationship with his sister, Maeve. With a distant father and an absent mother, the two of them have always looked out for one another. This is the story of their relationship first, and also the way each of them view and cope with the past. The Dutch House is the eccentric mansion that still symbolizes their childhood to both of them, but it is a place they cannot go home to. It's complicated--I'd recommend not reading too much about this book before starting it.I enjoyed this very much, and would recommend it! The one topic I'd like to discuss: Elna! Danny is very angry with her, while Maeve is over the moon to have her back--only to be left again. If Andrea is supposed to be the evil stepmother, I do not think she has a foil; Elna abandoned her children. Also, could Andrea have legally kicked a minor out of his home? And I'm curious about how poor Bright and Norma got on.Later note: I recently read Patron Saint of Liars, and--Rose reminded me somewhat of Elna. Two women who married too young?"

I am both an Ann Patchett and a Tom Hanks fan, and yet I hesitated to pick this one up. Was it too much press or fatigue with family dramas? I'm not sure, but I was completely taken with the idea of a house containing all of the things that shape a life. Beautifully written, I highly recommend it."
284,no user info,Rating 3 out of 5,The first part of the book found me rooting for the brother and sister but the sister was sick ALL THE TIME so that got boring. The most interesting character was the cowardly mother who left the husband she loved and her 2 small children because she didn't like the house they lived in !! Who does that ?? More like a 2.5 rating than a 3.

What I have always loved about her writing is the way she renders such complicated, yet realistic, characters, but there are two in particular in this novel (Andrea and Elna) who lack the subtlety that would make them feel real.

He is an amazing storyteller whose voice seems like home, so the story seemed more enjoyable. Excellent choice for the narrator! I probably would have rated the story itself a 4 or so had I been reading the book.This was my newest randomly chosen audiobook (thanks #27 💕) for my dog walking and ironing. I normally miss turning pages in a book, and while I obviously cannot do that while walking, this time I was happier listening to the book and would recommend the audiobook.It was a bit slow at first, and often wondered where the story was going, but by the time I was further in, I didn’t care where it was going. I just enjoyed the storytelling and was connected to the characters. My heart broke for certain characters. It was a good read if you enjoy family dramas."

The other brooding presence throughout is the Dutch House. Built in 1922, in Philadelphia, the imposing, three story glass building is the home that represents the dreams and conscience of the Conroy family.Family dynamics, the stresses and strains, the accusations, are what Ann Patchett writes about so expertly.The stepmother in literary history is well represented. She represents a challenge to the natural order of things that provides great stories of confrontation. Andrea, the second wife, is cast as the knowing interloper. She identifies a weak, lazy man (Cyril) and has no qualms about directly asserting primacy in everything that revolves around her and her children. Throw in some Machiavellian financial plotting and the reader is witness to actions of huge injustice.Do Andrea’s actions seem a bit far fetched and unbelievable? No they don’t.HighlightsPart One, which centres on Andrea, is an absolute master class in writing about vitriol, and the consequences of the pathetic non actions, and lack of assertiveness, by a father and husband as he flees to the safety of his workplace and abrogates his responsibilities in the domestic home.Maeve, who is fifteen years old at the start of the book, was my favourite character. The dynamic between her and Andrea is magnificently described.Maeve doesn’t scream and shout. Her cool, composed response to flagrant injustice is fabulous: her room is effectively annexed“It’s just like The Little Princess. They put her in the attic and make her clean the fireplaces. She turned to Norma (the young, newly ensconced step-sister  ” no big ideas for you miss. I will not be cleaning your fireplace”  (56) “She drew herself up like Saint Joan” they’ll hate you , she said, her voice matter - of - fact. Your daughters will hate you even more than we do. They’ll hate you after we’ve forgotten who you are” (93)The second and third parts of the story, Books Two and Three, don’t quite sustain the excellence of the start. Patchett structures the book in a deliberately non linear fashion, and in Book Two the back story described by Danny (the narrator throughout) is pretty unexceptional. Danny isn’t the most interesting of the characters. The third part of the book throws in a number of twists, and risks sacrificing the mostly subtle emotions aroused by the white elephant, the Dutch House itself.LowlightsMaeve is presented as a girl, and woman with abundant skills, and compassion. The absence of a life in a wider world (she is seemingly popular, and has numerous, (unnamed) friends), seems implausible.Historical & Literary•	Sibling love: I had expected to find other books in which brother/ sister are the essential focus of a story. Ones that have no sexual element. Some stories concerning twins concentrate on the essential, central bond. That’s what exists between Danny and Maeve. Danny’s wife, Celeste resents the unique bond (though, interestingly their children, and especially May, do not).•	The House. The books opening line: “The first time our father brought Andrea to the Dutch House” evokes Daphne du Maurier’s  Rebecca  “Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again”Gone with the Wind  (Margaret Mitchell) and Scarlett O’Hara’s ‘Tara’“Initially, it is a thing of pompous but shallow beauty, then a place of desolation but nevertheless still standing when the neighbouring homes are not, and finally as beautiful as ever but bereft of life and happiness” (Sound familiar?)Questions “you know Nell? She’s doing art restoration. She went to London three years ago. I don’t think she’s ever coming back”.  Not only is Professor Able a fringe character, his daughter Nell is even less featured. Why was she even mentioned?Recommend Yes, this book has some superbly crafted characters (the women especially). I’m surprised the book hasn’t been recognised in any book prize lists, as yet. I regard Ann Patchett as among my very favourite chroniclers of whole life stories."

And I've told some people that I was listening and added—pretty much always—that it seemed like cheating to have Tom Hanks narrate. We know Tom Hanks, actor, so well, don't we? We've seen him so often—once a year, maybe more—in one way or another. I'm pretty certain I've spent more time with Tom Hanks' characters than I have with members of my own family. I have watched him age, fight wars, help others, lose his way, fall in love, get sick and die. I know what his face looks like when he makes certain sounds with his voice. I know that hint of cynicism is frustration that will turn to endearment. And so, in reading THE DUTCH HOUSE which is a first person reminiscent narrator looking back at his life growing up in the eponymous house after his mother abandoned their family, sharing details of this house, and his love for his sister and his difficult father in what, throughout the novel, felt like aftermath, well, I knew him right away! I knew this Danny Conroy and so I could settle in. So is it cheating (I'm using this word very loosely and do not mean for it to imply wrong-doing by anyone involved—keep reading) to have a beloved author and actor and a much-anticipated novel come together this way? I don't know. Would less known but equally well-crafted novels benefit from having this kind of star power narrate the audiobook? I'm guessing yes. But not all books get this kind of marketing or support and so they will fall short by default. There are only so many Tom Hanks-es in the world. So, I had to put the cheating scandal aside and base this review on my listening experience. And, it was exquisite. (So, absolutely yes to the audiobook.)The novel itself, the story, was so beautifully written. I haven't read any other reviews and haven't actually heard an awful lot about this book other than general buzz about Ann Patchett's latest novel. So I don't know if Ann Patchett chose the name Conroy as an homage to Pat Conroy but listening to the sentence craft, those touches of melancholy in the language, were beautiful to me in the same way that Pat Conroy novels always touched me. I'm sure I would have gotten to THE DUTCH HOUSE in my TBR eventually but what this wonderful audiobook did is make me want to pick up the book because I want to see the words on paper and contemplate them more. Years ago I tried to read THE ENGLISH PATIENT and just could not get what was happening on the page. I loved the movie and went back to the novel with a new understanding and it opened up the book for me in a way I couldn't access before. I have a feeling listening to this audiobook first will open up the reading for me in the same way.Okay. So is that cheating? To make me fall in love like that? I don't know but it's dark now and I've just finished listening and I am on the lawn of the Dutch House. My feet are bare and I'm smoking a single cigarette, admiring my pink-painted fingernails. Beautiful people are in the glass house, holding champagne glasses, their laughter and the music and the stars are all crystals and it's clear and fragile and I'm crying a little because good fiction and a good story and a good storyteller will do that.Three years later, second reading. This time in paperback. Tom Hanks’s voice lingers but Patchett’s dignified and assured prose is the star, eclipsed only by the Dutch House itself. “My god, I love this so much.”"

Έχει ίσως το πιο όμορφο εξώφυλλο που έχω δει και κάθε φορά που το έπιανα στα χέρια μου το χάζευα και το χαιρόμουν! Τώρα όσον αφορά το περιεχόμενο, μου άρεσε αλλά το περίμενα καλύτερο είναι η αλήθεια.Οι πρωταγωνιστές του βιβλίου είναι δύο αδέρφια, ο Ντάνι και η Μέιβ, ο αδιάφορος πατέρας τους, η μητέρα τους που τους εγκατέλειψε για να φύγει στην Ινδία να βοηθήσει τους φτωχούς και το ολλανδέζικο σπίτι, μια πολυτελής έπαυλη με τεράστιες τζαμαρίες στην πρόσοψη. Ναι, θα μπορούσαμε να θεωρήσουμε και το σπίτι σαν ήρωα του βιβλίου αφού παίζει κεντρικό ρόλο στην ιστορία της οικογένειας και συμβολίζει κάτι διαφορετικό για το καθένα από τα μέλη της. Για τον πατέρα είναι η απόδειξη της οικονομικής του δύναμης, για τη μητέρα είναι σύμβολο πλουτισμού για το οποίο πρέπει να ντρέπεται αφού υπάρχουν τόσοι φτωχοί άνθρωποι στον κόσμο και για τα παιδιά είναι το μέρος που μεγάλωσαν και ένα είδος πατρίδας από την οποία τα εξόρισαν.Μετά τη φυγή της μητέρας τους, ο πατέρας των παιδιών παντρεύεται μια στριμμένη γυναίκα, η οποία έρχεται να μείνει στο ολλανδέζικο σπίτι με τις δύο κόρες της. Μετά τον θάνατο του πατέρα, όλη η περιουσία του περνάει στα χέρια της μητριάς και τα δύο αδέρφια, ο Ντάνι και η Μέιβ, χάνουν σχεδόν τα πάντα και εκδιώχνονται από το σπίτι. Στο εξής έχουν μόνο ο ένας τον άλλο και αναπτύσσεται μεταξύ τους ένας βαθύς δεσμός νοιαξίματος και φροντίδας. Συχνά μέσα στα επόμενα χρόνια πηγαίνουν με το αυτοκίνητο και παρκάρουν έξω από το ολλανδέζικο σπίτι, διατηρώντας μια «εμμονή» για το παρελθόν που τους εμποδίζει να προχωρήσουν στη ζωή τους.Η περίπτωση της μητέρας που εγκαταλείπει τα παιδιά της μου έφερε στο μυαλό την μητέρα της Κάιας από το «Εκεί που τραγουδούν οι καραβίδες». Έλεγε κάπου στο βιβλίο ότι τίποτα δεν είναι υπερβολικά απρεπές εφόσον βοηθάει να συνεχιστεί ο κύκλος της ζωής, εννοώντας, μεταξύ άλλων, ότι το μητρικό ένστικτο μπορεί να υπερκεραστεί σε περίπτωση που πρόκειται για ζήτημα ζωής και θανάτου. Η μητέρα της Κάιας κακοποιούνταν από τον πατέρα της και έφυγε για να γλιτώσει αφ��νοντας πίσω τα παιδιά.Στην περίπτωση της μητέρας του Ντάνι και της Μέιβ θα μπορούσαμε άραγε να τη δικαιολογήσουμε με τον ίδιο τρόπο λέγοντας ότι έφυγε ακολουθώντας την κλίση της να βοηθάει τους ανθρώπους; Ότι ήταν κάτι σαν αγία, όπως αναφέρεται στο βιβλίο, που αν δεν ακολουθούσε το κάλεσμά της η ζωή της δεν θα είχε νόημα; Ή μήπως ένας άνθρωπος που θέλει γενικά να βοηθάει τους ανθρώπους ενώ δεν μπορεί καλά καλά να βοηθήσει τα ίδια του τα παιδιά και να αντιληφθεί το μέγεθος του κακού που τους προκαλεί, είναι απλά ένας ναρκισσιστής που βοηθάει κυρίως για να αισθάνεται μεγαλόψυχος; Τείνω προς τη δεύτερη εκδοχή, ειδικά μετά από αυτό που συνέβη στο τέλος του βιβλίου, το οποίο ομολογουμένως με ξένισε και μου φάνηκε τραβηγμένο. Σαν να έδωσε η συγγραφέας αυτή την τροπή στην ιστορία για να γίνει κάτι σοκαριστικό στο τέλος.Γενικά, μου άρεσε η γραφή της Πάτσετ αλλά κάπου στη μέση βαρέθηκα λίγο και δεν καταλάβαινα που το πάει. Μου φαινόταν ανούσιες όλες οι περιγραφές της ζωής των δύο αδερφών και οι αναδρομές στο παρελθόν, ενώ δεν γινόταν κάτι ουσιαστικό. Νομίζω πως θα μου άρεσε περισσότερο αν δεν είχε απλώσει τόσο την ιστορία και ήταν πιο μικρό το βιβλίο.Υ.Γ.: Κάπως έτσι φαντάζομαι το δωμάτιο της Μέιβ (αν και αυτό δεν έχει κουρτίνα):"
294,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8037048-erin-glover,Rating 5 out of 5,"I love Ann Patchett's work and The Dutch House does not disappoint. The book is named for the 1922 home where Danny and Maeve, an inseparable brother and sister, grow up. The house becomes a character in the story with its see-through windows, and appearance of floating on top of the hill. Yet, even though the landscaping reflects the changing seasons, The Dutch House never changes. It's filled with treasures left by its previous owners who left during the depression, furniture and drapery that are never changed after Maeve and Danny's father buy the home at an auction. While all the other characters change and grow, The Dutch House remains a constant.Their mother is overwhelmed by the house and its ostentatiousness. After nine years, she up and deserts the house and her children, bringing Danny and Maeve even closer together. Eight-year-old Danny doesn't really know what's happening when their father introduces them to Andrea, a woman who will become their stepmother, bringing her own two daughters. In the world of bad stepmothers, Andrea is right up there as one of the worst, surpassing even Cinderella's stepmothers.Danny says, ""The only thing our father really cared about in life was his work: the building he built and owned and rented out. He rarely sold anything, choosing instead to leverage what he had in order to buy more."" So he left Maeve to tend to Danny. And he let Andrea take over the house, who went so far as to give Maeve's childhood bedroom away to her daughter while Maeve was at school, on top of firing the help the children had grown up with.When their father dies, through a system of wills and trusts their father bungled, Maeve and Danny are kicked out of The Dutch House by Andrea. They become acquainted with poverty for the first time in their lives. The only silver lining is an educational trust. Danny is basically forced to go to medical school by Maeve to use up as much of the trust as is possible, leaving little for Andrea’s daughters, a seeming act of revenge. The trouble is Danny only wants to follow in his father’s footsteps, buying up old buildings. He has no interest in being a doctor.The intensity of Maeve and Danny’s relationship is the highlight of the novel. For those of us who aspire to such relationships or know they are not possible, their tender care for each other over the years will tug at your heartstrings. Ultimately, this is a story about how a brother and sister’s love for each other transcends circumstances that would cause others to break. Death, revenge, illness, and socio-economic status all play a part in holding the story together. The surprise ending will pull your heart in all directions.Ann Patchett is a genius at dissecting family relationships. Her characters are rich and complex. You will hate some of them and love others. The rub is deciding if a particular character deserves hate, love, or forgiveness—or all three."
295,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33119635-neil,Rating 4 out of 5,"In the 1940s, Cyril Conroy surprises his wife, Elna, by secretly buying and then giving to her the Dutch House, a mansion in Elkins Park, Philadelphia, so called because of its original owners (the VanHoeBeeks), whose huge portraits still hang in the house along with all their other possessions: Cyril didn't just buy the house, he bought everything in it.Elna hates it. She hates it a lot. She hates it enough to take some drastic actions.Many years later, Cyril and Elna’s children, Maeve and Danny make repeated trips to sit in a car outside the Dutch House and talk about its influence on their family. Danny is our narrator for this story that jumps around over a 50 year period and gradually reveals the history of the Conroy family (which I am not going to discuss here - read the book!).The non-linear timeline of the story keeps the reader alert. I have to acknowledge that there were times when it took me a few pages to work out exactly when I was reading about (I had a similar experience when reading Commonwealth: Patchett doesn’t date stamp all her sections and it can sometimes take a while to place them in the overall timeline. That’s not a complaint as it adds to the fun of reading).As we read Danny’s recollections of his family, we also begin to see that he is unsure about some of it. He tells the story of how he met Celeste, whom he went on to marry, but it quickly becomes apparent that Maeve has a different memory of that. At one point, Danny asks ”Do you think it is possible to ever see the past as it actually was?” and later he says”Oh, would that we had always lived in a world in which every man, woman and child came with a device for audio recording, still photography, and short films. I would have loved to have evidence more irrefutable than my own memory…”Not only is memory suspect, but learning new things changes both Maeve’s and Danny’s perceptions of the past. At one point, Maeve says”I’ve always had it in mind that I hated Fluffy, that she had hit you and she had slept with Dad, but it turns out I don’t hate her at all.”This uncertainty about memory added to the changing perceptions as truth is revealed leads to a feeling of shifting sands beneath the narrative. Patchett isn’t writing a story full of action and drama - it’s a family saga telling the story of a somewhat dysfunctional family - but she is writing a story that makes the reader wonder what else was going on behind the scenes.The writing here is very easy on the eye. Patchett writes with a lightness of touch and sensitivity of observation that makes the pages flow by. There are insightful comments about human nature that are dropped in so casually they almost slip by. It all feels very accomplished. I enjoyed it a lot.My thanks to Bloomsbury Publishing for an ARC via NetGalley."

Patchett puts as much care and color into her characters as an artist puts into each brushstroke of a painting. If you told me she also created the portrait of Maeve on the cover, I would believe you.There’s no great twists or action-packed plot, just wonderful writing about complicated family dynamics. So many times I was filled with anger or resentment that mirrored a character’s, and sometimes surpassing it. Only to, by the end of it all, have it evaporate away and leave me wondering why I felt so much. To those with your own familial tensions: expect to be confronted with them as well.It’s not a sad book; it’s sad the way life is. Or beautiful the way life is. Or unfair the way life is. I really didn’t mean to write such a melancholic review, but I guess this is where I ended up. But in case there’s any confusion, I recommend picking up The Dutch House.*Thanks to HarperCollins & Netgalley for an advance copy!"

If you like deep dives into character driven narratives, this one is for you. Definitely a slow burn, a lot like her previous Commonwealth (although I liked this one way better), this story reminded me of Ask Again, Yes and The Most Fun We Ever Had. A complex, dysfunctional family takes center stage, focusing on a brother/sister pair and following from a life-changing event in their younger years through adulthood. I loved these characters. I loved their authenticity and how real they felt to me. The only thing that would have made it any better was if I had listened to Tom Hanks narrate the audio - which I do plan to do sometime in the future!This book was MADE for reading with a cup of tea/hot cocoa/coffee on a long, lazy weekend.

Siblings Danny and Maeve live in the house for a short period of time, but they are drawn to it like sailors to sirens. The Dutch House (so named for the original owners that are Dutch) comes to represent the turn in the road for the brother and sister. Their mother hated the home. She abandons the kids when they are young. Their father remarries, but their father’s choice pits the children against their step-mother. This book swept me into the lives of Danny and Maeve and I like how real this relationship feels. This is the type of book that unfurls slowly and gives vignettes of the lives of the characters that then paint a full picture. I’m glad I finally got to this one."

It’s a family saga that feels so real it could be anyone, anywhere. I thought it was going to follow the evil stepmother trope, but it’s much more complex. It’s about Danny and Maeve and how they rely on each other and navigate the shit show that is life."

304,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10762842-nicole-r,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is my favorite genre of book. A genre that I have trouble defining. Contemporary fiction with multi-generational families that are just simply trying to get through life. Is that a genre? I say yes. And this is a standout amongst the crowd.Many people will say that the central character of The Dutch House is, not surprisingly, The Dutch House. A 1920s monstrosity build by a Dutch couple who made their money in tobacco then purchased by Cyril Conroy in the 1950s at a foreclosure sale. Cyril moves his wife and two children, Maeve and Danny, into the house and things begin to unravel. Many other people will say that the central character of The Dutch House is Danny. Our narrator and tour guide and we witness the unraveling--and survival--of the Conroy family. The mother leaves, Cyril remarries, and eventually Maeve and Danny grow into adulthood. And we see it all through Danny's eyes.But I say that the central character of The Dutch House is Maeve. She essentially raises Danny, she is his best friend, and his telling of the story always revolves around Maeve. And I cannot overstate how much I loved Maeve. I loved her and, maybe even more, I loved her and Danny's relationship. They were more than just siblings. They were each other's only family, best friend, constant relationship. I also hated characters too. Not that they were poorly written, but that they were wonderfully written and I was supposed to hate them. Both Danny's mother and step-mother were cruel, horrible, selfish people. I think I was maybe supposed to actually end up liking the mother, but I didn't. By the time this wonderful story came to a close, I didn't want it to end. I listened to the final chapters with tears in my eyes and the ending was about as close to perfect as I could have imagined. My only complaint is that I wanted more. I could have listened to another 10 hours of this story and devoured every second. After being completely let down by Commonwealth a few years ago, Patchett comes back with a vengeance, publishing my hands-down favorite of her books to date and restoring her to my good graces.Added bonus: Tom Hanks narrated the audiobook. I'll admit, it took me a few chapters for it to stop feeling like Woody from Toy Story was reading me the book, but he really was an excellent selection. And I wonder how she snagged him....Easily a Top 10 book this year."

Erzählt wird die Geschichte zweier Geschwister über fünf Jahrzehnte und mehrere Generationen hinweg - ich sage doch, familiär richtig ""satt"" ;) Maeve ist zu Beginn elf Jahre alt, ihr jüngerer Bruder Danny sechs. Sie wachsen mit ihrem Vater in einem riesigen, geschichtsträchtigem Gebäude auf, eben jenem Holländerhaus. Die Mutter hat die Familie verlassen - ihr Verschwinden wird über die Jahre immer wieder beherrschendes Thema bei den Geschwistern sein (ebenso wie das Haus).Ohne Mutter (dafür mit sehr liebevollem und schön gezeichnetem Personal) im Haus hat Maeve schon früh die Rolle der Beschützerin für ihren Bruder übernommen - eine Rolle, die sie im Laufe der Jahrzehnte immer wieder unterschiedlich interpretiert. Danny ist sich seiner Rolle und der seiner Schwester bewusst, und die enge Bindung und Loyalität der Geschwister zueinander stellt sich nicht immer als gänzlich konfliktfrei dar.Ich habe mich sehr gerne in diesem Setting aufgehalten. Die Geschichte plätschert nett dahin, und ich meine das ausschließlich positiv! Es gibt schon einige Gimmicks: Die Geschichte wird nicht gänzlich linear erzählt sondern springt zeitlich hier und dort, das Märchen-Thema von Hänsel und Gretel ist recht offensichtlich, aber dafür auch sehr charmant umgesetzt, es ist angenehm und interessant, mit Maeve und Danny zu ""altern"" und das Drama, die vielen tollen emotionalen Momente, können sich durchaus sehen lassen.Was mich bei diesem Buch letztlich besonders begeistert hat, war, dass es eine TOPP 1A herrlich hassenswerte böse Stiefmutter gibt. Hach, wie lange hatte ich keinen Charakter mehr, den ich so leidenschaftlich, mit so viel Hingabe, verachten und mental ausbuhen konnte. So was muss auch mal sein, und da hat Ann Patchett hier für mich 100% ins Schwarze getroffen."

I wasn't sure about this book, but having seen before where Tom Hanks narrates this book, it sounded more interesting and I decided to give it a try. This was an interesting story of a brother and sister who grow up in The Dutch House really find out who and what family is when they are adults. Having grown up only knowing their mother ran off, a mysterious nanny named Fluffy, a step-mother brought in who has no feelings toward them, a housekeeper and cook who are really more family than not, and a father who decides that questions unanswered are best. But after the death of their father, and being asked to leave the Dutch House, the only home they have ever know really, does Maeve and Danny really find out who their family is. After Maeve becomes ill do all these people come back into their lives and really show them, they were more family than they thought.

He doesn’t break the cycle, we never break any cycles, and what I thought was a stilted and anticlimactic ending was probably just realistic.

So why only two stars?Because of two fatal flaws:1.. The main character was a male who never sounded like one. The thought patterns, internal dialogues, and even the way he arrived at conclusions were decidedly non-male. I am generalizing, of course. There are probably men out there who think/act this way. But if the main character was one of these outliers there should've been a way of understanding his uncommon behaviors.2. The house, which is supposed to be a character in and of itself, was boring and two-dimensional. Patchett spent a ton of pages describing it and how it affected its occupants over the years, but it was hard to see how something so blase could have such a lasting impact. Again, it was not convincing.It is always interesting to read the work of gifted writers. It's just that this one left me a bit flat."

I have never read this author before but I am going to check out more books by her now. The character development of this story is some of the deepest I have ever read while simultaneously keeping character motivations at arms length from the reader.

The Dutch House is a poignant story of humanity, relationships and family ties. A remarkable and meditative read, The Dutch House is a moving story for those who appreciate character focussed tales.Opening after the Second World War, we witness a family move from financial concern to economic stability as the patriarch of the Conroy family makes a business move that will change their lives forever. As a result, Cyril Conroy buys the Dutch House, a sprawling estate in the Philadelphia area. But the acquisition of this mansion will have far reaching implications for Cyril, his wife and his children for years to come. Narrated by Danny, Cyril’s son, we follow this family’s exploits as they deal with the ebbs and flows of life. Despite the setbacks and the difficulties this family faces, the two Conroy children forge a strong bond. The Dutch House spans over five decades, revealing much about the state of family relationships, sibling bonds, expectation, success, loyalty, abandonment, self-belief, confrontation, ire and protection.I’ve heard only good things about Ann Patchett, the author of The Dutch House so I was really looking forward to experiencing my first book this highly regarded writer. I chose to listen to The Dutch House on audiobook format via the candid storytelling approach of Tom Hanks, who was perfectly cast as the main narrator Danny. Although I loved this one on audiobook, I’m confident that the print or e-book version would be just as engaging as the Audible text.The Dutch House is a book you need to savour and tread lightly with. I’m glad I listened to this one over a longer stretch of time than usual and I wasn’t tempted to rush through. The Dutch House is heavy on everyday life musings. It is not a strong action-packed novel. Spanning over a number of decades, it was a blessing to follow Danny, his sister, wife and family through the sands of time. With Patchett’s introspective focus on character, each protagonist is presented at their very optimum thanks to Patchett’s skilled prose. This is a remarkable novel. The Dutch House definitely made its mark on me.Special mention needs to directed towards the Dutch House itself, a formidable building with a life of its own. Patchett’s detailed and descriptive word formation allows the reader to believe that they are an essential part of the walls of this memorable estate. I could easily picture the paintings, furniture and room space of this structure. Patchett is able to express the sense of place in The Dutch House perfectly. I also need to highlight the relationships interrogated in this novel. Patchett accurately portrays the complex relations between parents and their children, siblings and partners. Every human connection in The Dutch House is relayed with understanding, compassion, honesty and maturity. I’m just so glad to have finally connected to Ann Patchett’s brilliant writing."

The Dutch House is much lighter compared to Bel Canto but it also possesses a similar charm and sorta magical quality.This is a character-driven novel and a slow burn; there is a general plot, but it's pretty much established in the first quarter of the book, though I found it very intriguing. At the heart of the story is the relationship between our narrator Danny and his older sister Maeve, their fierce bond and how they take care of each other throughout their lives. We follow them through decades, from their childhood to their fifties. The Dutch House, a grand WWII-era mansion that the family moves into before Danny was born, is like a character because of how vividly it is described and also how significantly it impacts Danny and Maeve's lives. It has a big part to play in why and how their family is shaken up: their mother leaves them when they are just kids (it's a mystery why she leaves), and soon their stern father re-marries another woman who gradually begins to take over the house. What develops after that should be left to the reader to discover, so no spoilers!The writing is very rich in laying out the characters' psyche; all the major characters are complex and human, flaws and all. I just LOVE the storytelling and the narrative voice. It helps me get deeply invested in the characters, so I didn't mind the slower pace and little action. It's a wonderful and moving story about family, the bond between siblings, forgiveness, nostalgia, and how time and emotions colour our memories.I was completely engrossed and captivated by the first half. The second half, though, made me feel like there should be something more and deeper. Ann Patchett was trying to work in something about class and wealth in relation to Danny's family and their dysfunctionality, but she explored the issue on a pretty surface level. Class served more as a plot point than for social commentary. There's some passing talk about ""serving the poor"" and ~going to India~ to do so, and it all bordered on poverty porn and made me cringe. That's my main gripe, but it's a big and important one, so it affected my overall liking of the novel."

За мен лично имаше няколко слаби звена- не можех да усетя нито героите, нито обстановката пълноценно.
