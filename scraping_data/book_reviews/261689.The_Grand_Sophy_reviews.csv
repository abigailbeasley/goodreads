0,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4687823-vinaya,Rating 5 out of 5,"The one thing that always puzzles me is people's tendency to compare Georgette Heyer to Jane Austen. As well compare Crime and Punishment to a John Grisham novel! I am not denying the literary merits of either genre; far from it, in fact. However, that doesn't change the fact that one is trying to compare chalk and cheese. Jane Austen's purpose in writing her novels was not merely to tell a story. In fact, the story was merely a vehicle to examine critically the mores and customs of the society of her times. In an era where women academicians and philosophers were all but unknown, Austen used the only avenue open to her to espouse her brand of social commentary - the novel. Georgette Heyer, on the other hand, wrote to entertain. Full stop. Her books are not, and were never intended by her to be, anything more than a pleasant way to pass time. That being said, in the context of the Regency romance, she is the unparalleled expert. Her knowledge of the ton or Regency high society, is unmatched by any novelist save those who actually lived in those times. Frivolous and flighty though her work may be, the authenticity of her voice cannot be denied. The Grand Sophy is my favourite Georgette Heyer book. I have a special place in my heart for each and every one of her novels, but in The Grand Sophy, she brings to bear all of the skills that are her forte. Sophy is charming and strong-willed, a force to be reckoned with. Unlike with most of our recent Regency romances, her heroines are never milk-and-water misses; I do not think I have met a single Heyer heroine who could not kick the ass of our current crop of romance heroines. Working within the boundaries of a rigid society, she manages to make her women intelligent, witty and charming. Sophy is a devious, meddlesome schemer, who manages to win our hearts, and the hero's, without ever submersing her personality. What draws me back to Heyer time and again is the sheer sense of fun that she manages to impart to each and every one of her novels. The plots are never standard, nor are the heroines or the heros. Take, for example, Gilly from The Foundling. He's no alpha man; he's a timid, weak aristocrat who still somehow manages to be adventurous and find himself and his path in life. Or Freddie from Cotillion, a dandy with no great physical prowess or good looks, who manages to get the girl of his dreams simply by being kind and reliable. These heroes are so real, so much more believable and lovable than the rich, dissolute alpha males of our contemporary historicals who manage to win the heroine simply through the hardness of their abs and the hugeness of their ""manhood"". Georgette Heyer's books will live on long after the Harlequin historicals fade from our memories, simply because she is superlative at what she does: making you believe in romance. Not lust, not soulmates but romance."

May 2021 update: Q: Why did I reread this for the third time when I have a massive backlog of books sitting on my shelf that I haven’t gotten to yet? A: It was fun and witty and (mostly) lighthearted. No regrets!If you ever wanted to see a Regency-era heroine really take charge of her life, you'll probably love The Grand Sophy. Sophia Stanton-Lacy, better known as Sophy, is dropped on her aunt's family by her globetrotting father, who asks his sister, Lady Ombersley, to watch over his poor little Sophy.Enter Sophy, 5' 9"", independent-minded and brimming with confidence. Sophy quickly figures out all of the dysfunctions in the Ombersley family, including a father with a gambling addiction, a passive mother, a daughter who throws over the perfectly nice, eligible lord she's supposed to marry in favor of a swoony, absent-minded poet, and a younger son who's managed to get himself into some deep trouble. And the older son, Charles, who has taken over control of the family and its finances to try to pull everything together, and in the process has lost his sense of humor, turned into a domestic tyrant of sorts, and managed to get himself engaged to a vindictive, overly proper woman, Eugenia Wraxton.It's a good thing Sophy is a take-charge-and-fix-it kind of person. Also luckily, Sophy is intelligent and has a great sense of humor. It's a sheer pleasure to watch her take on Charles.He said stiffly: 'Since you have brought up Miss Wraxton’s name, I shall be much obliged to you, cousin, if you will refrain from telling my sisters that she has a face like a horse!''But, Charles, no blame attaches to Miss Wraxton! She cannot help it, and that, I assure you, I have always pointed out to your sisters!''I consider Miss Wraxton’s countenance particularly well-bred!''Yes, indeed, but you have quite misunderstood the matter! I meant a particularly well-bred horse!''You meant, as I am perfectly aware, to belittle Miss Wraxton!''No, no! I am very fond of horses!' Sophy said earnestly.Jane Austen's Emma should take a clue from Sophy. Emma tries to manage everyone's lives, especially their romances, and is usually wrong. Sophy - who, in fairness, is much more cosmopolitan than Emma - pretty much always succeeds at managing everyone's lives. Luckily for everyone involved, she's also pretty much always right, with one notable exception that ends up turning out right anyway, because the universe clearly loves Sophy.I really didn't mean to swallow this book whole in one day, but once I got going I couldn't stop. And when Heyer pulls all the main characters together at the end for one of those absurd farcical scenes she does so well, it was comedy heaven.This would be a 5-star book, easy, but unfortunately there's a really problematic minor subplot, right in the middle of the book, that involves a stereotypical greasy, evil Jewish moneylender (the name Goldhanger and his ""Semitic nose"" are your textual clues). It lasts for about 5 pages, max. I've looked at different ways of rationalizing this (those were different times? it's just one character and not necessarily the author's commentary on all Jews?) but I can't get comfortable with it. Nor do I think I should - this was published in 1950, post WWII, by which time people generally and Georgette Heyer specifically should have known better. This one scene will ruin the entire book for some people. If you can rationalize it or ignore it - or skip over it, knowing that Sophy prevails in their brief encounter - this is otherwise a completely delightful book. If you can't, that's totally understandable. I understand the racial descriptions have been removed from some editions of the book, like Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None, which seems to me a happy answer to this problem.Because really, Sophy's a great character and, that one scene excluded, this is one of Heyer's best novels. I would love to hang out with Sophy - we could braid each other's hair and she could fix all my problems. Content notes: Definitely some dated stuff here: In addition to the brief anti-Semitic jabs, you have a somewhat volatile love-hate relationship where the guy jokes about how he’s going to choke the girl then kisses her. Don’t read it if that’ll offend you."
2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25867535-carol-she-s-so-novel,Rating 5 out of 5,"One of Georgette's best loved Regencies it is impossible to read it any other way than as the story is told - breakneck! & the smile never left my face!While Sophy stays true to the period, in a lot of ways she is a far more modern heroine - it simply doesn't occur to her she can't be independent or that she doesn't know what is best for her cousins the Rivenhalls when she is sent to stay with them.The whole family reminds me of the Von Trapps in a Sound of Music, with Charles Rivenhall having Captain Von Trapp's autocracy & his father Lord Ombersley his distance. & there is a gaggle of adorable young children & teens. Lord Ombersley would be a good candidate for Most Irresponsible Father in a Georgette Heyer Novel. His fecklessness means that Charles has taken over the family reins & has become old before his time. To ease his load, he becomes engaged to the serious & deadly dull Eugenia, not recognising the mean spirit hidden behind the correct Society manners.Clearly Sophy can't let this sad state of affairs continue & mayhem follows, till everyone gets their happy ending!A wonderful caste of characters that I have fallen in love with. A minor quibble is that one of the younger children Theodore disappears from the book - or else is merged with another son Hubert. But Heyer had a lot of strands going in this book so that is understandable.Less forgiveable is the anti-Semitism, baffling since Heyer herself is believed to have some Jewish blood. I still prefer to read uncensored & just accept my literary idol did have feet of clay.With this edition - a typo in Chapter 8. The cover is a little insipid - no way could that girl be the sparkling Sophy! Let's say they are Cecy & Charlbury! This one (that I grew up with) is far better! 

& Outrage! there are rumours of a Grand Sophy film in the works. Before you break out the champagne - read this link! https://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/... I'm hoping this is a wind up, but not mentioning Heyer's name & calling the book a ""bodice ripper"" aren't good signs!Edit 4/8/15; I've heard from Jen Koestler & another member of the Georgette Heyer fans group has heard from scriptwriter Olivia Hetreed. The bodice ripping Jane Bond idea was discarded years ago. Hetreed writes that she is a lifelong fan of GH & will hopefully produce something true to the spirit of this book.Edit: Quite a coincidence - last read almost three years ago. Still no sign of the promised movie. Sigh.My previous review still stands - I'll just add that I have a far better opinion of Charles this time. With that father, no wonder he has become bad tempered & autocratic!

My third read since being on Goodreads (although I have read at least sixty times before that.) What can I say - I'm obsessed.After a particularly disappointing read from another author what is really great with the better GH novels is how you are launched into the story straight away. Even minor characters are clearly delineated & you don't have trouble following the story!An easy 5★"
3,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17438949-melissa-dog-wolf-lover-martin,Rating 5 out of 5,"Buddy Read w/ the wonderful, Candi & Phrynne.Once again, my goodreads friends and in groups have gotten me to read a book that I thought I would never like - and guess what? I loved it! Lady Ombersley's brother, Sir Horace decides to leave his daughter, Sophy with them while he is away. Sophy usually goes with him when he travels the world, but on this occasion he needs her to stay with her aunt and uncle and all of the cousins. What a joy Sophy was to a most droll household. The eldest brother, Charles was so tiresome in the beginning. He didn't seem to want to let any of the women have any kind of fun or do anything for that matter. Charles is also engaged to the horrible, Miss Wraxton, I wanted to drop kick her off the roof. They both seemed made for each other, at least in the beginning =) And then . . . SOPHY arrives. I thought she was going to give her aunt a heart attack. You see Sophy has been brought up very differently then most girls. She arrives with her beautiful horse Salamanca, Tina her little Italian Greyhound and Jacko the monkey she brought for the children that she rescued. I think she had a bird too. I just loved her. =) Sophy is a force to be reckoned with, she sets out to turn everything right for as many people as she can. She works on her cousin, Cecy, who is being stupid in her choice of men. She helps her cousin Hubert who is in a bit of a gambling situation himself. There are several things she does and she doesn't take no lip from Charles. She puts him in his place so many times I loved it so much. Sophy is such fun. She asked her aunt where bank was so she could go get her finances in order. Well this just about made the woman in the family fall over, not to mention Charles. No one ever heard of a woman going into a bank. And then Charles is taking Sophy to the back because that's how she rolls =) They got into a little arguement when Sophy was asking Charles where she could buy her own phaeton and horses and he was livid, saying women don't drive their own phaetons. Blah blah and blah. Well she showed him. After her business in the bank, where she had Charles wait in the phaeton, they stopped off on an errand for Charles. She waits in the phaeton with the groom. I knew exactly what she was going to do when she takes off one glove and lets it fly over to the ground. She talks the groom into going over to get it and this is what happens next:'Tell your master that it is too chilly to keep the horses standing!' Sophy called after him. 'I will tool the curricle round the streets for a few minutes, and come back to take him up when he is ready!'The groom, who was stooping to pick up the glove, nearly fell over, so swiftly did the spin round. He had an excellent view of Miss Stanton-Lacy (Sophy) driving at a smart pace up the street. He made a gallant but belated attempt to catch the curricle, but it swept round a corner just as the wind blew his hat off, and sent it blowing down the street.Needless to say that Charles was furious when she got back. I laughed and laughed. Since Charles wouldn't tell here where to buy a good phaeton and horses she asked another gentleman she met when she was out at the park with some of the family riding horses. Of course they had a fit because Sophy was racing Salamanca around and women just don't do that in the park. lol Sophy ended up getting some horses a man was selling that supposedly everyone wanted, but she got there first. And she ended up getting her own phaeton that was considered a sporting one and not one for a lady. This is how I picture it since it's supposed to be 5 feet high, which is my height. It's like those monster trucks, the monster phaeton. lol Once again I loved how many family members Sophy helps in this book and I loved the many times she put Charles and Miss Wraxton in their places about things. He said through shut teeth: 'I think I told you once before, cousin, that we did very well here before you came to upset all of our comfort!''Yes, you did, and what you meant, Charles, was that until I came no one dared to flout you. You should be grateful to me - or at any rate, Miss Wraxton should, for I am sure you would have made an odious husband before I came to stay with your Mama.'She even goes to see an moneylender to help out the other cousin I mentioned. And oh my goodness! She is not afraid of him or cares less for what he says. When he dares to try to threaten her she just pulls and gun and demands what she came for, says she will give him the money owed, or she can go to the cops or just shoot him. Either way . . . and she gets what she comes for =)Sophy had me laughing or smiling through most of the book. She is someone I would love to know in my real life. I loved her and I loved this book. Another little gem found in the wonderful world of books and book friends. ♥ And yes, Sophy finds love herself at the very end! ♥MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading List"
4,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3639005-candi,Rating 4 out of 5,"""She was by far too tall; nose and mouth were both too large, and a pair of expressive gray eyes could scarcely be held to atone entirely for these defects. Only you could not forget Sophy, even though you could not recall the shape of her face, or the colour of her eyes.""I for one will not forget the unstoppable and vivacious Sophy Stanton-Lacy anytime soon! A truly entertaining Regency Romance with one of the most delightful and dynamic heroines you could ever hope to encounter from this time period, The Grand Sophy is the perfect book when you need a break from your denser and darker reads. It is fast-paced, clever and often humorous. When Sophy’s father, Sir Horace, is summoned to Brazil on business, he entrusts her care – as well as the search for an appropriate marriage match - to his sister’s family. When Sophy arrives at the Ombersley doorstep complete with dog, parrot and monkey, she instantly creates a sensation. While the Ombersleys learn that Sophy is indeed unconventional, Sophy discovers that aunt, uncle and cousins are perhaps a bit dysfunctional. From cousin Cecilia who pines for a flighty poet much to the dismay of her family, to Lady Ombersley whose vinegars and fainting couch are always close at hand, to the often absent and oblivious Lord Ombersley, to cousin Horace with his concealed gambling debts and to cousin Charles himself, the true and exacting master of the household, Sophy will have her hands full. Sophy and Charles immediately butt heads and Sophy proves herself an impressive match for this unyielding gentleman. When Sophy tries to sort out and influence the various relationships and love matches, the household is further shaken up. The insipid and meddling Eugenia Wraxton, betrothed to Charles, is an excellent counterbalance to Sophy’s high-spiritedness. Eugenia says of Sophy, ""It is a pity that men will laugh when her liveliness betrays her into saying what cannot be thought becoming. It brings her too much into notice, and that, I fancy, is the root of the evil."" In regards to Eugenia and Charles, Sophy ""felt it a pity that so promising a young man should be cast away on one who would make it her business to encourage all the more disagreeable features of his character."" Throw in some reckless riding, a showy and decidedly unfeminine – at least by the standards of the day – carriage, an elegant pistol, a variety of other colorful characters, a scheme to set everyone straight in the world of romance, and you will find that Georgette Heyer most assuredly concocted a very pleasurable and wholesome adventure! This is my third Heyer read and I have plenty more downloaded to my kindle for those days when I want something light, witty, and engaging. I highly recommend trying one of her books if any of those qualities appeal to you."

The Godfather Georgette Heyer has all her little ducks in a row. She's got the period detail, check. She's got the Old World styles, check. She's got all the characters who don't know what's about to happen to them and who'll get what's coming to them, check. She's got the manipulations and the double blinds and the cards all stacked up, check. She's got the romance under wraps but about to come up on deck, check. And she's got the gun and someone who knows how to use it, check. The Big G knows what time it is and the reader's about to know too.

Kingpin Sophy brooks no disagreement. Oh she'll let you rant and rave all you want. Let the little pawns moan and groan, but in the end they'll fall right in line. Sophy knows what's best for you, just follow her lead, minion. You'll see.

Dapper Don Sophy has all the skills and she pays all the bills. She's got the street smarts she learned on the Continent. She's got all the connects to the old school players. She's got the fashion sense to turn all heads. She's got the gun that will silence your attempt at some funny business. Minor league players don't stand a chance. Best stay in line.

Boss Bitch Sophy has her eye on that mouthy guy. She likes his sass. She'll show him how she handles a horse, 'cause that's her way of flirting. And she'll show him how she handles a gun, that's how she lets off some steam. She plays a little rough but she knows he'll learn to deal with it. She don't pick no weak bitches to be her number two. He'll learn it's best sometimes to just shut up and look pretty. Sophy always gets her way, there's no stopping this juggernaut, step aside or get rolled over. Don't mess with this one."
6,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,Rating 4 out of 5,"A Regency Romance? What? What?Ah, but this was nothing very stuffy, indeed! Sophy was the model extrovert, a clever and busy and downright machiavellian girl. Do you like characters with so much agency that they pop right off the page? Sophy is your girl.Of course, that also means that she's pretty much a terror for all the stuffed shirts around her, and between getting in the way and deciding to ""help"" her relations find marriage, while all the while being the unwitting subject of the same dastardly plot.How will this comedy turn out??? Truly, the pacing is good, the plot is pretty Shakespearian, and the stuffed shirts get stuffed.It was pretty fun! Mind you, I do love a bit of romance fluff every now and again and this was light and churlish and sometimes even devious, but it is also pure popcorn fiction.I'm glad to have read it, but it's not generally the kind of thing I read, or at least, the setting isn't. The storied plots are pretty universal, though, and there were plenty of chuckles in store for me. Here's to broadening my horizon!"

And besides: Sophie is an awesome badass! :)"

Im Jahr 1816 durchaus ungewöhnlich. Und so eckt sie auch oft an, hat aber auch einen ganz besonderen Charme, so dass man sie einfach mögen muss. 💜Das Buch hat mir im Großen und Ganzen gut gefallen. Unterhaltsam und amüsant, stellenweise aber auch etwas langatmig. Für mich hätte es ein paar weniger Seiten haben dürfen und etwas mehr Romantik. "

The vivacious, unconventional and head-strong Sophy is a delightful heroine. She comes to stay at her aunt when her diplomatic father has to sail away to Brazil, of all places. She soons detects many problems that the family is struggling with, and decides to intervene. For their own good, of course. The Grand Sophy is the perfect read when you need a lull from denser, darker ones. It is fast-paced, clever and funny. Perfect brain-candy. Enjoy!"
10,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2250020-tatiana,Rating 3 out of 5,"I think ""The Grand Sophy"" is an excellent recommendation to fans of Jane Austen and regency romance, especially those who are quite sick of contemporary versions of the genre filled with throbbing members and heaving bosoms. This book is very clean, light and reminiscent of Austen's masterpieces in its humor and focus on domestic issues - marriage, unwanted engagements, cheating husbands, gambling debts and such. The language is sophisticated, the characters are well drawn and likable, and the romance, infused with funny flirtatious banter, is quite compelling. If I have to compare Heyer and Austen, however, Austen wins without a doubt. Her observations of the society are much deeper, her characters are much better developed, her wit is superior. While ""The Grand Sophy"" is a very entertaining story, it drags in places, sometimes gets repetitive when the same events are described and explained to several people, and the ending is a little hectic, with too much going on simultaneously to enjoy the final love confessions. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the book, would recommend it to those looking for Jane Austen substitutes (instead of those horrid zombie parodies and sequels) and will probably read Heyer in future.P.S. I saw some reviews accusing this book of being anti-Semitic. That's a huge stretch IMO. "
11,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/101060033-woman-reading-is-far-too-behind-to-catch-up,Rating 4 out of 5,"3.5 ☆ rounded upPBS' ""Sanditon"" has just concluded its second season, and I'm now receptive to reading Georgette Heyer, who has been compared with Jane Austen. While both incorporated the society of Regency England into their works, Austen had critically skewered social conventions while Heyer's novel descended into farce, seemingly only for entertainment. I also had the preconception that Heyer had written historical romances but I didn't find that to be a fully accurate categorization of The Grand Sophy.This novel was entirely character driven with the charismatic, irrepressible, and fearless Sophia ""Grand Sophy"" Stanton-Lacy at the epicenter. Sir Horace was widowed when Sophy was around five. Contrary to convention, Sir Horace kept his daughter with him in all of his diplomatic assignments during the Napoleonic Wars. Before duty sent him to Brazil, he lauded his only child as he persuaded his sister Elizabeth - Lady Ombersley - to host Sophia, now twenty, during his South American tour - 

""She has her head well on her shoulders, my Sophy... I never worry about her. ... She's been about the world enough to be well up to snuff... just as happy in a Spanish village as in Vienna or Brussels.""

But then Sir Horace's quirkiness surfaced during this conversation with Elizabeth - 

""It's a queer thing that any son of your and Ombersley's should have grown into such a dull stick. I suppose you didn't play Ombersley false, did you?""

And finally he dropped a verbal bomb that suggested that the apple did not fall far from the tree - 

""I never knew Sophy when she wasn't always busy with some ploy or another.""

Sophy arrived with aplomb at her aunt's London residence and came bearing exotic animals as pets for her younger cousins. Sophy reminded me of Nancy Drew (including fast driving and gun-toting) but a livelier version whose investigative abilities were all directed at sorting out problematic relationships in her aunt's family. And there was plenty of opportunity as her uncle - Lord Ombersley - had gambled away the family fortune while his eldest son Charles tried to curb his father for the sake of the six siblings who resided with the parents. 

“Let me tell you, my dear Cousin, that I should be better pleased if you would refrain from meddling in the affairs of my family!”“Now, that,” said Sophy, “I am very glad to know, because if ever I should desire to please you I shall know just how to set about it. I daresay I shan’t, but one likes to be prepared for any event, however unlikely.”[Charles] turned his head to look at her, his eyes narrowed, and their expression was by no means pleasant. “Are you thinking of being so unwise as to cross swords with me?” he demanded.Sophy... [was] undismayed by a situation which would have daunted a less ruthless female than herself. Those who knew her best would have taken instant alarm, knowing that, her determination once taken, no consideration of propriety would deter her from embarking on schemes which might well prove to be as outrageous as they were original. 

 The Goodreads synopsis revealed too much of the plot, and I'm glad that I had barely read it before starting this novel. There was plenty of amusing banter to laugh at but the events were steadily descending deeper into farce, which isn't my favorite. Even though this was published in 1950, Regency England's prejudices toward Jews and Europeans were on full display. And the repellent depiction of the villainous Jew jarred me out of the story's comedic flow. There was a romance but it was not the main focus of the novel. Indeed, by the end of the book, I didn't even know why Sophy had chosen the beau that she had and good grief, they're first cousins!.

""If I survive this adventure there can be no question of that. Your fate is writ clear: you will be murdered. I cannot conceive how it comes about that you were not murdered long since!""""How odd! Charles himself once said that to me, or something like it!""""There is nothing odd in it: any sensible man must say it!” 

Overall, The Grand Sophy was an enjoyable, if not always believable, romp through 1816 England with a fabulous heroine."
12,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18780551-anne,Rating 5 out of 5,"I wonder if I'll ever read a Georgette Heyer and not fall madly for it?This one is definitely in my top favourites! It was funny, witty, engaging and just awesome!!! It was more about Sophy's ingenuous plans in rescuing everyone's problems than an actual romance, but it was so engaging and hilarious that I didn't really mind. All the characters were so special and unique and just such FUN! :DThe hero was very different from other Regency romances! In fact he acted mostly like an anti-hero, what with his tyrannical and spiteful ways, and his immense ""dislike"" of Sophy! But I couldn't really blame him because I felt so sorry for him that he was engaged to Miss Wraxton, who was undoubtedly the most ""proper"", ""dutiful"" and ""well-bred"" woman in London, and it really was no wonder that such a dead bore of a Bluestocking would turn him bitter! Imagine having to spend the rest of your days with a woman who made it her duty to report to you even the most insignificant gestures of your relatives? And who actually enjoyed talking about the plants that grow in Jamaica? Yeah, very tedious! Why Charles proposed to her in the first place is still a mystery I'm trying to solve. The reason I wasn't turned off by him was that Heyer would show us glimpses of his warm, loyal and loving side from time to time, and we were given to understand that he was just a man who had a lot of difficulties to bear, and who needed the right woman beside him to help him through them.Sophy, is independent, bold, courageous and delightful, and she loses no time in taking the town by rage and resolving in untangling everyone's problems. And she does it brilliantly! Her exploits were indeed wonderful and so hilarious! She was so kind and always acted with the best intentions in mind. I think she might be my favourite Heyer heroine so far! She was very modern minded and if she lived today, she would be just the kind of woman who would make an excellent counsellor! Or possibly she would prefer to be a zookeeper, as she seemed to have quite a passion for animals! She arrived in Berkeley Square with a monkey, a dog and a parrot, and it is later discovered that she keeps ducklings in her house!This is what makes Heyer's novels so much fun! She always adds super random elements that give such a comedic turn to everything that one cannothelp but to burst out laughing! Lord Bromford (who was a male version of Miss Wraxton) and his cold and mustard-bath were simply hilarious! There were also two extremely funny shooting scenes, a poet who was so lost in his bubble he didn't even have a clue he was getting married, a man with the mumps and a lovely girl named Cecilia who was so sweet she deserved the best!  I was never more glad than when she ended up with Lord Charlbury! The man was such a sweetheart, and I felt bad for him that he might acquire the reputation of a rake, because of Sophy!The Grand Sophy is definitely one not to miss!
Ducklings!

- He is making a cake of himself! (fool)- Don’t look so hagged! (disturbed)- Friday-faced creature (miserable)- I hope he doesn't plant me a facer! (punch me in the face)- I feel smirched! (dirty)- That girl is a hoyden. (improper)
High perch phaeton with hoydenUnfortunately Heyer is historically anti-Semitic as well. Just when you're cruising along, having a wonderful time with this fizzy story, which is the sort where you can't really keep all the characters straight nor do you feel a need to, Heyer goes Full Dickens. The scene featuring Goldhanger, a ""thin, swarthy individual, with long greasy curls, a semitic nose, and an ingratiating leer,"" is long and powerful; it's important to the plot (because it establishes that Sophy's a good shot); and it would have been bigoted even for its time: Dickens caught a lot of shit for his awful anti-Semitism in Oliver Twist (1839). Bigotry makes books worse, for me, because I don't like it and I get angry when I read it. When I look back on a bigoted book, I remember that it made a cake of itself. I sometimes remember other things, too! The predictable but terrific denouement of this book, for example, requires the Grand Sophy - a descendant of Emma's line of overconfident manipulators - to use that gun again, and also to release ducklings everywhere, as a certain someone ""took Sophy’s throat between his hands, pushing up her chin. ‘Will you marry me, vile and abominable girl that you are?’"" That's weird but funny, and there are a lot of other funny lines in here, too. It was extremely pleasant to read - except when it wasn't."

The hero isn't as much fun as Avon is, but the heroine, Sophy, far surpasses Leonie. Sophy is, admittedly, forward, bold, and out-spoken enough that she could have become as irritating to me as Leonie is; but I think Heyer handled Sophy with far more skill than she did Leonie - no great surprise, perhaps, since there's a gap of about three decades between the two books - and she's instead a very joyful character, and great fun to read about.I think it's also superior to ToS in that, like Jane Austen, Heyer has realised by this time that her strength lies in writing novels in which, well, not very much happens at all. Whereas ToS is crammed full of kidnaps and mistaken identities and cross-dressing, long-lost noblewomen, The Grand Sophy's plot is composed of nothing more exciting than a case of the mumps, and the resolution of a number of (admittedly somewhat tangled) marriage plots. Its function is really to allow Heyer to write about the marvellous array of wits, rakes, eccentrics, snobs, dandies and heroines that populate the pages of her novels, and to let her show off the subtle, witty dialogue at which she excels. Definitely some of the best historical fiction out there, whether romantic or not."

Sophy has always been one of my favourite heroines and again she did not disappoint:)From the moment the Grand Sophy makes her magnificent entrance you know you are in for a fun ride! Heyer wrote many excellent and charming characters in her time but this young lady is one of the best. Her enthusiasm for life and her determination that everyone around her should be happy too makes her a joy to be around.Heyer's other great skill was in writing entertaining dialogue and much of it in this book is laugh aloud funny. I found myself quoting bits of it aloud to anyone who would listen. So I am a Georgette Heyer fan and for me she can do no wrong. However I am sure that anyone who enjoys a light, historical, innocent romance would like this book too."

There are some genuinely funny bits, and the whole is so cinematic that it surprises me this hasn't been optioned by the BBC. Though if they do, I hope they skip that disgusting middle chapter, or take the FAIL out of it."

It was written in 1950, and actually, due to the historical nature of the subject matter, doesn't feel THAT dated (caveat, see one of the things I hated about the book, lol), and is very witty and engaging. The main character reminded me of Katherine Hepburn in ""Bringing up Baby"", one of my favorite movies, and, although her antics would NEVER have been accepted in the real period, I loved the banter and her saucy attitude, it felt authentic rather than forced like some ""spirited"" historical romance ladies do. A lot of the insults about the other stuck-up chick made me laugh out loud. Very sly sense of humor. Overall I enjoyed this book. BUT two things made me take away a star each...BAD THINGS ABOUT THIS BOOK AND MILD SPOILERS:-Horrible stereotypical Jewish moneylender character in the latter half of the book, I mean seriously horrific awfulness. It's up there with Mickey Rooney playing an Asian dude in ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" (No one seems to remember that part of the movie with as much horror I as I do). Maybe worse. I guess makes you appreciate living when we do. I skimmed over the scene mostly, but seriously bad taste in mouth.-OMG GROSS THIS ROMANCE IS ABOUT FIRST COUSINS!!! I mean seriously, the ending repulsed me, I kept seeing babies with a cyclops eye, like that guy from Goonies, when they embraced. I know people used to do that back then, but GRODY BUSINESS. I couldn't get over it, so that's why I reduced my rating."
18,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2329228-amy,Rating 5 out of 5,"2021 ReviewIn 2019 I commented on Sophy's young age; in this read, I realized how relatively young Charles is too. It gives me more hope for their relationship. Also reading this one a tad less literally calmed many of my concerns about his temper. 2019 ReviewI try and re-read all my favorite Georgette Heyer books every year and as a result, my reviews really show how I have ""grown"" with them. Books that I liked immensely initially fall a little in my regard. Books that I dismissed become favorites as I age. (I've been reading Heyer for nearly a decade now!) But The Grand Sophy has always been at the top. And the problem with that is that I do not often take the time to reflect on this book. It is just The Best. A book to measure all other books by. My go-to favorite.But last night as I stayed up past 2 am to finish, I was struck by a realization: Sophy is so young!Only 20!Of course, when I first picked up this book I was 17. Sophy was older, more mature, more confident, more everything. She instantly became the unattainable person I wanted to be. I am not cut in Sophy's mold (much more Frederica!) but that has never stopped me from thinking of Sophy as...well, a goal to strive for. Except now I read about her and think, 'Good golly, no wonder she got away with all that! She's so young!"" I never saw her actions as impetuous. But now I do! And far from alienating me, it makes me love this story even more. She still is an amazing character. She still inspires me. But she no longer feels like a character on a pedestal. I can see her without the hero worship. And she is a darling!2018 ReviewI lied. I'm not done with my Heyer kick. I love her books too much!Georgette Heyer is my one of favorite authors and this is my favorite book by her, so by rights this is one of my favorite books ever. It has an enduring quality I love. No matter how many times I read it, I pick up on new nuances. I know I say this with all her books but - I love these characters. I love Sophy. I want so much more of her. What was her childhood like? What will her future be like? The thing is...this time through the vague concern I had about the love interest became a fully developed thought. Don't get me wrong, Charles is great. I am worried about that temper of his though. When he asks Sophy to marry him, she says something like, ""Yes, if only so you won't wring my neck!"" and why does she say that? Because he puts his hands around her throat! I know the running joke throughout is that she is going to be strangled, but such levels of violence - even in jest which I'm not convinced it was - looks cute and first and quickly becomes domestic abuse. I don't think Charles's temper is healthy, or laudable. What also concerns me is the thought about how bored Sophy will be married to Charles. She is a meddler. Once she's solved all his family's problems, then what? She thought a few months in London would be dull. Yet now she's staying! It might be different if Charles was the sort of person who would help her with her meddling, or be a partner in it. Instead he is much more likely to try and stop it whenever possible. (Not that it will be possible, because Sophy.) Of course, I'm taking an almost ridiculous amount of interest in these characters lives and expending worry on something that isn't even real but...that's a sign of a good book, right? And this is a very good book.2011 Review The Grand Sophy  by Georgette Heyer was simply a delight to read. In fact, I haven't really done anything else all day. While my experience with Heyer has been ""limited"" to Arabella , The Grand Sophy was  so  much better and such a delightful read, I half suspect none of her other books compare. Dear me, what shall I read now? xD Plot  When Sir Horace Stanton-Lacy abruptly asks his sister, Lady Ombersleys, to host his only child, a daughter,(perhaps finding the girl a husband, while she was at it) while he is away in Brazil, she readily agrees, expecting her motherless niece to be a quiet and shy companion for her own dear daughter. What she does  not  expect is the  The Grand  Sophy! Impetuous, shocking, and perfectly  un -shy, Sophy quickly discovers that there is much amiss in the Ombersleys household! What! With Charles about to marry a girl as horribly boring as himself, and Cecilia determined to go against her parents wishes and marry a poet, Sophy has her work cut out for her!  Thoughts!  I thoroughly enjoyed this book!! For most of the beginning I was simply struck by how amusing it was (Anna is of the opinion it is exactly my sense of humor) but eventually I came to love the characters and plot as well.  Sophy Stanton-Lacy is a tall, well-endowed girl quite unlike your typical heroine, regency or otherwise. She is blunt, forceful, and  unusually  creative in her attempts of making people happy. Her very forcefulness sets her apart, as does her delightful ability with a gun and horsemanship. I loved how she remained...somehow feminine, despite her unusual behavior and, frankly, appearance. She was much better than Arabella, displaying none of that character's silly behavior, but just as likeable.  And, like Arabella, the cast of characters are so funny and well done, I wish I could give them each a proper bio. The men really do rival Austen gentlemen, and I think Mr Darcy shall have to watch his place very carefully in my regard. I love how Heyer manages to give insight into the thoughts and emotions of characters without actually needing to  delve  into them, it is much easier to like someone when you don't have to listen to their every thought. It also makes the reading processes  so  much more enjoyable, subconscious interaction!Lord Bromford was a very humorous character who reminded me a great deal of Mr. Collins. In fact, he might even be the more ridiculous of the two. Hubert, the younger son, was also charming (Though a note, I spent most of the book picturing him as a 12-year-old, when in fact he is 20!) Heyer once again pulls off a bunch of unusual, quirky characters to very little distraction. Even characters that, in a less generous or well written book, would be easy to hate, she manages to create so well that you can’t help liking them anyway.  I was delighted with the characters, plot, and writing! It is a superlative novel and I would heartily recommend it to females of all sorts. (I can’t really imagine guys taking as much pleasure in it.) Amidst the Twilight craze and the culturally endorsed Barbie-doll look, Sophy proves to be an unusual and refreshing change. She is large, forceful, and yet feminine. I’d recommend it to all age groups, It is not your usual book and not your usual heroine. Its regency, sure, but you don’t have to be an Austen fan to enjoy it. You’ll be left wanting to do something saucy and impudent, shock the world twice over, and maybe fall head-over-heels for any ole’ ridiculous reason. It is just that sort of novel. And  it s good. So shoo!! Go out and get yourself a copy!!!! Read it!! Be daring! Pass out copies to your close girlfriends and recommend it to your book clubs! Laugh! But most of all,  enjoy yourself!  It is a rare day you find a novel that strikes such a sensible note amidst the wonders of the female mind…"

The heroine who isn't a heroine. It's fixed in time and place, but with a heroine who seems modern. Sophy is fantastic. She's so very skillfully drawn. Every action and word from her is much more carefully considered than in many others of her heroines, and not forced for the sake of the romance. At least, it felt that way to me. The romance seems very secondary to the plot and character development. At least, the main romance that matters. The rest are just entertainment. The whole thing works so very well. It's bright and energetic and hilarious. The plot is fantastic, the endless capers are quite funny, and the character development seems very real and natural. It reads incredibly fast. So fast I want it to start all over again.And now I want to read it again!Love love love this book to no end.PS: However, there is a bothersome Jewish stereotype in this book. It did give me pause after I finished the above review, but it is such a small part of the book, and the rest of the book is so unlike it, I decided not to change the above enthusiasms."

I think this book has too much going on and there are too many situations that make us lose sight of the main plot and couple. Still a wonderful little book that I highly recommend but I don't think I'd still call it my favourite Georgetter Heyer.Read July 2019 (5 stars):Man, why has it taken me so long to read a Georgette Heyer book and who will be able to stop me from buying all of her books now? I guess we'll never know.I absolutely adored this book from start to finish and devoured it in a matter of hours with no regard for sleep or food or pretty much anything else.It follows a young woman called Sophy, whose widowed father is sent to Brazil on diplomatic duties and so she is taken in by her aunt's family to stay with them in hopes they can find a husband for her. They all expect a shy, half-orphaned young girl in need of mothering and direction, and are entirely shocked to find their niece and cousin anything but. Sophy is self-possessed, cultured, frank, loving and above all takes no shit from anyone, least of all her imperious cousin Charles, who has taken charge of the household after his father has fallen into gambling debts.What ensues is a series of hilarious escapades and machinations by Sophy to rescue her family members from their various predicaments and steer their lives in much happier (and also more exciting) directions, while never failing to enrage Charles and upset some societal norms and expectations in the process.The book is above all laugh-out-loud funny, with the characters and dialogue positively jumping off the page and never failing to endear you to them (almost all of them, at the very least. I'm looking at you Eugenia).The main romance is very subdued and only really a thing of the last few pages (which is probably a good thing, considering that they are in fact first cousins), but the build up is everything you could ask of what probably boils down to the very first hate to love romance ever written (don't google this little fact, I can't vouch for its veracity).I love the writing, the characters, the setting and the obvious amount of research that went into it, the humour and above all, Sophy's wit and intellect. She was an absolute pleasure to read about and I genuinely wish there were sequels or spin offs or practically anything that would allow a revival of her character in some form.A definite new favourite with extremely high re-reading potential, I absolutely recommend everyone to pick this up as soon as possible!"
23,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,Rating 3 out of 5,"I was told this would be light and fun. By the end, this was exactly as I too saw it to be--my first Georgette Heyer!The author wrote this in 1950. It belongs to what is known as the Traditional Regency Romance genre, the genre for which the author is famous. Such books are, of course romances, but they are without explicit sex. Even discussion of sex is verboten! They are set in the early 1800s but written by authors of later generations. They are characteristically filled with fast-paced dialogue. Historical details are accurately drawn, including details describing clothes, rooms and their furnishings, modes of transport, mannerisms and social etiquette. What characters say and how they behave must capture all aspects of early 1800s English society faultlessly. In books of the Regency Historical Romance, a second subgenre of Regency Romance novels, characters behave according to modern standards although the time setting and the other characteristics remain the same. This constitutes a substantial difference. As mentioned, Georgette Heyer belongs to the first subgenre.When I state that Regency novels are characterized by fast-paced dialogue and that the dialogues mimic the talk of earlier days, pay attention. This does not facilitate comprehension to modern day readers, and perhaps some of the intended humor is not properly grasped. Many of the idioms spoken are not used today. At times I only understood what was said through words’ context. I’ll give you two examples. Do you understand these idioms?*You are not missish. *Make a cake of yourself.Furthermore, the prose is wordy--VERY wordy. One is swallowed up in pretentious, shallow and, in my view, irritating small talk. What I am saying is that the prose, rather than being delightful and fun, is a chore. There is humor in the prose; I knew where I was meant to laugh, but I was not laughing. The detailed talk about one’s means of transport drove me bonkers. One does not speak merely of carriages; one refers to a post chaise, hack chaise, curricle, high perch phaeton, barouche-landau, post chaise and four and more. This is of course all very accurate, but if one scarcely knows how they differ, such discussion becomes simply tedious.While the prose failed to please me and only off and on amused me, the plot, what happens as the story winds up, did amuse me. It is what happens that makes one smile. Sophy’s antics are amusing. What she does will make you smile. The story, through its plotline, becomes light, is silly and scarcely believable, but fun in all its innocence.This is a story about Sophy Stanton-Lacy, she is twenty years old and the eponymous heroine of the book. Her father, Sir Horace Stanton-Lacy is a diplomat. His wife is dead and has been for years. It is he who has raised Sophy, in his own and very masculine manner. She has traveled the world with him. He is off to Brazil, but now she is to stay with her aunt, uncle and cousins. At the start, one thing that threw me was that Sophy’s uncle and aunt have a surname different from their kids. Her uncle and aunt are called Lord and Lady Ombersley. Sophy’s cousins are not Ombersleys but Rivenhalls! There is Charles Rivenhall who is twenty-six. He is the oldest, and strange as it may seem, the ruling figure of the family. The others in descending age are Hubert who is at Oxford, debutante Cecelia, Selina, Theodore, and finally Gertrude and Anabel. There are lots of characters, but they are not hard to keep straight. There is a “up in the clouds” poet, an arch, ever so proper and egotistical fiancée, a governess, a Spanish Marquesa and let’s not forget Sophy’s three pets--a monkey, a greyhound and a horse! They all play a particular role in the story, but Sophy is the star, as the title indicates. She is the Grand Sophy. Sophy has spark. She is brash. She is resourceful, frank and outspoken. Watch and see what this woman does. She involves herself in the lives of each and every one of the Rivenhalls. While the social chatter of the novel’s beginning annoyed me, by the end I was caught up in the hilarity of its whirlwind conclusion. Do remember that this is a romance! Who will end up with whom is the primary question. More than one alliance must be arranged.The audiobook is narrated by Sarah Woodward. I did not like it at the start. A bunch of people are talking. I didn’t understand who was who, and all were chattering at a mile a minute. Yet I grew to like the narration a lot and have given it four stars. Woodward uses different intonations for different characters. You come to understand who is speaking just by the intonation. The intonation of Sir Horace, the father of Sophy, is marvelous. The intonations capture well the characters’ personae.The story verges o the slapstick. Let’s call it a parody. While I am glad to have read it, I really don’t think I will be reading more by the author. One Heyer is fun, but one is also enough."

While I refuse to read regular romance novels, Ms. Heyer's books, which I discovered as a teenager, are well written and FUNNY.

I know we all have different tastes for books, but when I veer off so decidedly from everybody else in a book that is an almost universal fan favorite among Georgette Heyer readers, I does make me question my own reading tastes. Oh well, it's not the first time this has happened, and it won't be the last.The character of Sophy was the only bright thing about this book IMO. She was independent, bright, mischevious and resourceful without being annoyingly Mary-Sue-ish. I liked her attitude and can-do spirit alot. With a better hero, I would have rated this much higher. But Charles was a dud. A dullard. An uptight prig who never thawed out, developed, or showed a passionate nature. And by passionate I'm not referring to romantic passion, but just a passion for life or a strong determined nature. For me, it just wasn't there. After worrying about the idea of two cousins getting romantically involved, that worry never came to pass."

29,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5858699-kavita,Rating 5 out of 5,"Regency romance novels often feature heroines who are capable and often have to take their destiny into their own hands. But Sophia Stanton-Lacy beats them all. Growing up in Spain and Portugal during wartime, Sophy's education largely dispensed with the useless and unnecessary restrictions placed on women. When she reaches an age to get married, her father leaves her with her aunt in England.Sophy's new home is a hotbed of discontent and she catches on to it quickly. There is the usual financial constraints, a hot cousin who thinks he is in love with someone else, younger brother in trouble, younger sister in love with the wrong man, and a dissolute father and a clearly useless mother. In this scenario, Sophy takes charge and makes everything all right again.Heyer has created her most delightful character in Sophia, who is just the right mixture of elegance and spunky. She fits in right into English society as she did in the Spanish one, and refuses to be cowed down by conventions that don't suit her. There is little passion between her and her romantic interest, but that is more than made up by a steady friendship and intense trust. Not a typical romantic novel fodder, but you can see the two living happily together. The plots are quite stereotypical and what makes the novel different is the way Sophy handles the problems thrown up by the sub-plots. The dialogues are witty and fun, and overall, The Grand Sophy is a fun way to pass the time."

Never have I read a book and ended up just exhausted by the dialogue almost always ended with exclamation points (!)And this went on the entire book!


The story: can i say repetitive? Quite tiresome the relationship between Sophy and Charles. Those back and forth between them were almost always fruitless. And did I say repetitive? (Sorry, cannot help myself!)Charles's verbal attacks were something I could totally do without. They were many of them too. *sigh*Charles who i suspected to be the love interest? The question mark was there because even at 70% in, I couldn't sense chemistry or romantic feelings on both parts.Seeing a lot of 5 stars from fellow readers, I was an anomaly.So, obviously the writing here was not my cup of tea. At all. It was disappointing to be sure since I had heard for years how wonderful Heyer's writing was. I think the writing played a big part in me not partial to the story or its characters. Too bad.Maybe I picked the wrong book to be my Heyer initiation?Or maybe that fault laid entirely on my own expectation?Whatever the cause, I am sorry to say my first experience with Georgette Heyer was not very satisfactory."

On this reread I started to find Sophy's antics and manipulations a little tedious and OTT. I did like Charles, though, and it was also great to see Eugenia get her comeuppance. She and Bromford truly deserve each other, and one can imagine them being extremely happy together. So in spite of the ridiculous way she went about it, Sophy did Charles a true good turn by saving him from marriage from Eugenia. They would have made each other truly unhappy. The book proved to be a little dated in its racial stereotyping, both of the Spanish marquesa, and especially of the Jewish moneylender. I felt uncomfortable reading this section, even though Sophy handled the situation masterfully."

As a Jane Austen fan, it was so nice to read another Regency Period novel, but with a much more buck-the-system female than any of Jane's characters. Sophy is one of my favorite characters of all time. If I can't be her, I want her as a best friend. The last two chapters in particular were so much fun and comical. I woke up thinking that I can't wait to read more before remembering that I finished this last night. Highly recommend!"
33,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22177907-qnpoohbear,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5 starsWarning: This book was published in 1850 and takes place in 1817. The book contains some harmful language that may upset some people. It also contains some (joking) references to threatening domestic violence. Don't read if that upsets you.Lady Ombersley is overcome by her brother's plea to welcome his ""little Sophy"" into her home while he is away on a diplomatic mission to Brazil. Sir Horace Stanton-Lacy is quite a force and Lady Ombersley does feel sorry for her poor motherless niece. When ""little Sophy"" arrives, she does so in full force. Sophy is neither little nor to be pitied for being motherless. She is an immediate hit with the children for bringing them an exotic pet and for her lively and open manner. Charles, the heir, however, is less than impressed. He holds the purse strings in the family and is engaged to a very proper lady. He can't have Sophy's wild ways ruining his family and his relationship. Sophy has other plans for Charles and for the entire family. She sees they are badly in need of someone to rearrange their lives and Sophy is just the person to do it. The madcap ""Grand Sophy,"" sets London on it's ear and manages to charm everyone, except Charles and his fiance, Eugenia. This is one of Georgette Heyer's best novels and the zaniest of all the Regencies. I'd give it somewhere between 4-5 stars - 4 3/4 maybe. The plot starts off slow but picks up quickly once Sophy arrives. Her adventures are very funny and there are a few plot twists and surprises along the way. A lot of people say an Anti-Semitic comment ruins the book for them. I wasn't terribly bothered by it. The first time I read it, I missed the adjective describing the villain's nose and thought it was just a typical depiction of a villain - kind of cartoonish. Take out that one word and you pretty much have the same description of Severus Snape. As an historian I know that an author doesn't exist in a vacuum. They are real humans who lived at a certain time and were influenced by external factors. Combine this with the time period the novel takes place. I would have expected vastly more racist and Anti-Semitic remarks. Other authors of the same generation, writing around the same time, used much worse language and the farther back in time a book was written, the less politically correct it's going to be. (Numerous Victorian novels refer to ""red Indians"" from America in contrast to ""blacks"" from the Indian subcontinent, not to mention dropping the n-word and other terms in common usage at that time). I've read way worse so I move on to see what happens next. The next scene is largely improbable but it's so much fun that I enjoyed it.The ending keeps me from giving this book a full 5 stars. It's not romantic and it's very abrupt. I can guess where her lover falls in love with her but not the other way around, if she's in love at all. It's a little more ambiguous than some of the other novels.Sophy is like a tornado in full force, coming in and picking everyone up and tossing them back down again. Tornado though she may be, she has plans for everyone and she knows what she's doing. She does what she does out of the purest motives and has a generous and loving heart. That makes her one of Heyer's more endearing and memorable heroines. I liked her very much though like Charles, if she were my cousin, I would want to throttle her. I like the Rivenhall family, except for Lord O. He's a rackety sort of fellow. Though Lady O is nervous, has spasms and overly cautious at times, she seems to be a loving mother and is willing to be a kind, surrogate mother to Sophy when asked. Cecilia and Hubert are young and rather silly at times. Cecilia is a little annoying in her infatuation with a ridiculous poet. Hubert has some growing up to do but he acknowledges this like a man and some of the blame falls to Charles. The little ones appear and disappear randomly but they're very lively and loud little children. Amabel is the only one who gets scenes all to herself but she doesn't really get fleshed out. I'm not a huge fan of Charles. He has a nasty temper but he defends his family, including his cousin and he has more of a sense of humor than he cares to admit. He's just not at all romantic. Other wonderful characters include a lazy Spanish Marquesa and a foppish poet (who is hilarious and steals every scene he's in, especially at the end). Lord Charlbury, who is Cecilia's beau, seems like a nice man. He's too old for her and I don't really get why he's so insistent he's in love with a 19 year old girl.Then there's Eugenia, the fiance of Charles. She's annoying, pedantic, snobby and rude. Yet, I feel sorry for her because she was brought up to be like her mother (who is clearly a very awful person who thinks too highly of herself) and now Eugenia is at a certain age where the suitors have mostly gone away. She needs to marry Charles because she can't be sure of getting another proposal. She's been taught to think too highly of herself and can't understand why others don't view her as exceptional and take her advice. That makes her truly annoying and a character readers love to hate. If you're new to Heyer, I wouldn't necessarily start here but if you're a fan of her other Regency novels, you'll love this one too.*************************Reread October 2022******************************New review contains spoilersThis is just what I needed after a reading slump. It's so zany! It's too bad she didn't write this in the 30s because it would have been made into a movie with Katherine Hepburn. She would be my Sophie. She was tall, sensible, modern, not too pretty and could rattle off fast-paced dialogue. Her beloved Spencer Tracy was too old for Charles. Maybe Jimmy Stewart or Carey Grant? Anyone else a fan of Depression era screwball comedies? What would be your fantasy casting? I noticed more of the signs of growing feelings between Charles and Sophy. Previously, I only noticed it in Amabel's sickroom but it happens a little sooner, after she helps Hubert. Charles doesn't realize it quite yet but Sophy does and Eugenia starts to notice too. Charles only realizes after they share a look over Amabel's sickbed. Then he withdraws because he's miserable, trapped in a loveless relationship he can't get out of honorably. It's up to Sophy to formulate her plan.I don't think she expected Charles to offer for her right then and there but she may have thought he was bound to tell Eugenia who would moralize and then maybe he'd blow up at her and she'd break it off. The way it all played out is ingenious and so zany. The ducklings! Augustus made me laugh out loud. He's so silly with his head in the clouds. I feel sorry for his father who must continually support the young poet forever. I feel a little bad for Eugenia but not too much. At first she's just repeating what her mother drummed into her head. Then she decides to go rogue and REFORM the family. That just serves to make them hate her. I think it's unfair of the double standard that allows Charles to marry someone the family doesn't like or approve of but Cecilia must be forced into marrying someone they DO like and approve of. (Nevermind that he's a great guy and a good fit for the family). However, Eugenia lets her jealousy of Sophie eat her up and cause her to become catty. Once she started interfering in Sophy's life and acting spiteful, then I lost sympathy for her. I sure home Lady Bromford and Eugenia's mother feel alike about everything because poor Lord Bromford is going to find himself doubly under the thumbs of two strong women. His mother's concerns for her only surviving child are valid so long as he was a CHILD but now he's an adult, it's up to him to live his life and if he doesn't survive because of something he does, then that's his problem. He's a dead bore because of his Mama. I think if he had stayed in Jamaica a little longer he might have learned to think for himself a bit more. I also noticed on this read, the weather. It's cool all summer and rainy off and on. The year is 1817 and that detail show's Heyer's commitment to making her world authentic. It really was a cool, wet summer. https://www.pascalbonenfant.com/18c/g...I also noticed how much she borrows from Austen! She uses two phrases from Pride and Prejudice slightly out of context. She repeated sentiments undergoing a change a few times and just the word sentiments, which Austen uses 77 times in one novel, compared to Heyer's 14! She also turns around Darcy's statement ""You are too generous to trifle with me"" when Cecilia tells Augustus she wont trifle with him.I was curious what Sir Horace was doing in Brazil. Encyclopedia Britannica states : ""The prince, the royal family, and a horde of nobles and functionaries left Portugal on November 29, 1807, under the protection of the British fleet. After several delays, they arrived at Rio de Janeiro on March 7, 1808.The colonists, convinced that a new era had dawned for Brazil, warmly welcomed Dom João, who promptly decreed a number of reforms. He abolished the Portuguese commercial monopoly on Brazilian trade, opened all harbours to the commerce of friendly nations (mainly Great Britain), and repealed laws that had prohibited Brazilian manufacturing.""Dom João installed in Rio de Janeiro his ministry and Council of State, Supreme Court, exchequer and royal treasury, Royal Mint, royal printing office, and the Bank of Brazil. He also founded a royal library, a military academy, and medical and law schools. His decree of December 16, 1815, designated the Portuguese dominions the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves, thus making Brazil coequal with Portugal.""https://www.britannica.com/place/Braz..."

It moved along charmingly enough, (although I found the heroine to be too much of a meddler) and then........the evil Jewish moneylender appears. This book was published in 1950, barely five years after the end of World War II. Did Miss Heyer not read the newspapers? Go to the cinema and watch newsreels? I don't think it's possible that she missed hearing about the deaths of millions. As for the excuse that this is about Regency England, well, plenty of authors have written novels set in this time period without putting this sort of bigotry in them. 1950! Not 1850. I'm gobsmacked."
35,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58398280-laure,Rating 4 out of 5,"A lovely book. The plot was a bit laboured towards the end, still in keeping with Sophy's unpredictable nature. The dialogues between the characters were first rate. 'Flirtation' at its best!"
36,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70220708-elizabeth,Rating 4 out of 5,"I've been reading Heyer's novels for almost two years now (crazy!) and yet I haven't returned to this first one I read. Why? For many reasons - see my below review; also note that this was one of the very few reviews I have ever attempted to write for a Heyer novel. (Are those facts correlated? The jury's still out.) Even upon reread, I don't want to give this one a full five stars, though I enjoyed it a great deal, because I still don't like Charles. And yes, that's the only reason. Yet... I will happily give it four stars and admit that I chuckled a great deal & can understand why this is Heyer's most popular novel. I stand by most of what I said below, but I'd like to add one more thing: this is not the best introduction to Heyer. The Grand Sophy was the first one of hers I read, for clarification. Instead, I'd suggest Arabella, Frederica, or Sylvester. Any one of those three would be a fantastic introduction to this marvelous author. And on a similar note - you get really used to her writing style with ""flowing periods"" and *lots* of exclamation marks in the dialogue. Like I said, this was my first Heyer and it took a bit of getting used to - but you will get used to it. August 2021 review: I honestly have no idea what to rate this. Georgette Heyer certainly is hilarious, witty, and clever, and this book was a great introduction to her works. My main problem with The Grand Sophy is I found myself disliking the heroine's love interest. He was overbearing, proud, and rude, and we never really saw those flaws made right. At first, I thought he would be a ruder Mr. Darcy, but that notion was quickly dispelled from my mind. I think he's a cross between Knightley and Darcy, except with fewer redeeming qualities. Thus, as I was unable to enjoy the main character's romance, I found myself in awe of the clever ending... but not liking Sophy's closure. I liked her too much to approve of her match! Sophy was an unforgettable heroine, and I loved reading her story. Sophy and her romance is probably only a personal problem, and it definitely shouldn't stop you from reading and enjoying this book as much as I did. I laughed so much! Heyer may not be as witty and brilliant as Austen herself, but this book will not disappoint Austen or Heyer's fans. Aside from Sophy's romance, I also didn't love the dialogue. Over half of the dialogue were exclamations (ending with exclamation marks, that is). It got old really quickly, and I began mentally reading them as declarations, not exclamations. I'm sure that simply has to do with the period it was written in and written for, though. (But I must say that I've never seen dialogue like this before. Not in Austen's writing, nor in any of the other great female writers from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.)Recommended to 13+ for mild content, including language (not half as bad as what can be found in a lot of modern books, though) and romance (and a few instances where bad things could have happened but didn't). I almost didn't rate this because I had such a hard time deciding what to give it. But I think 4 stars is good, because I did love this book. I deducted one star for Charles, but The Grand Sophy was hilarious and I thoroughly enjoyed it."
37,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2431873-emily,Rating 4 out of 5,"Good God, I LOVE reading about tall heroines who have fashionably expensive taste and a disregard for delicacy. The Too Tall Grand Sophy is an excellent rider who owns a silver pistol, is so mischievously intelligent that she runs circles around those trying to foil her plans, and while not beautiful is so charismatic that everyone loves her. Is this wish fulfillment? I DON'T CARE! SHORT PEOPLE GET WISH FULFILLMENT ALL THE TIME! When the Honorable Eugenia Wraxton (who considers herself tall and elegant) has to look up into Sophy's face and is quite miffed, I let out a loud HA! In fact, this book made me laugh out loud several times, and I feel okay in this one instance saying that the dialogue sparkles. It truly does. Even though the plot loses steam somewhere in the middle, Sophy, her cousins, and the suitors (particularly Augustus Fawnhope) have such lovely rapports that I wouldn't mind reading their tête–à–têtes all day. The entire thing started to feel a bit too farfetched when Sophy visits Goldhanger (and what is this piece of anti-Semitism supposed to achieve, I ask you?), and I really wanted more emotional closure out of the end of the novel. Is it supposed to be meaningful that it's ""Miss Stanton-Lacy"" instead of ""Sophy"" meekly submitting to Charles's will at the end? I was willing to be convinced of Charles's fitness to be married to such an indomitable character, but though by the end I knew that Charles would benefit from Sophy, I was not quite sure what Sophy was going to be getting from Charles - so I wanted more on that front. I didn't need the declarations, but maybe a little quiet time? But overall, I had such a fun time reading this, and Sophy made me laugh so much. Viva the tall!!!!!"

She was a powerhouse of a woman and I enjoyed every minute in her company.👍 What I Liked 👍Sophy: This book was recommended to me because I like Jane Austen's Emma and I wanted to read something else with a character resembling Emma. While Emma and Sophy share many similarities - they both like matchmaking, they are both sociable and they both follow their own mind even when family and friends try to discourage them - I found Sophy to be a sort of powered Emma. An Emma times two, so to speak. It was as if everything about Emma was turned up just a bit. But Sophy also had her own traits. She was reckless and adventurous, stubborn and brave. It was really a pleasure to read her story.Plot: Though the plot was not much to speak in and of itself, I really liked the ease and the sweetness of it. I liked how lighthearted of a book this was.

39,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33283784-wollstonecrafthomegirl,Rating 4 out of 5,"I consider myself a pretty learn'd historian, particularly of women and gender in Britain post-1792, and, yet, before I started to read romance, I'd never heard of Georgette Heyer. She's a founding member (not consciously, obviously) of the most popular fiction market in the world: romance. And she undoubtedly launched a thousand writing careers; I think pretty much all of my favourite historical romance writers cite her as a major influence. I understand, intellectually, why she's not as well known as Austen, or the Brontes, or Gaskell, or Shelley, but, it seems to me, her influence on literature is probably just as significant, if different to those authors. That's all a roundabout way of saying: it's taken me far too long to get to Heyer, but on the strength of this book it won't be long before I return to her world. ***Spoilers below***This was delightful. The central reason for that delight is, of course, Sophy. Remarkable Sophy. She is a tour da force of personality and activity and intrigue and plans. She swept me away. I thought: soon she will do something to make me dislike her, but she never does, she's always a step ahead. Even when she shoots people completely unexpectedly, I am charmed, like everyone else. What a fantastic heroine.Her various layers of wonder are slowly, humourously unpacked by Heyer, until we reach Amabel's illness and she demonstrates that she's not just a manager of people and love lives and balls and financial scrapes and all manner of animals and firearms: she's a caring, fearless woman too and a nursemaid. We see the completeness of Sophy, and so does dear Charles, in, for me, the most romantic part of the book. The moment Heyer steps back from farce and gives a pure human insight. In the dim candlelight of Amabel's sick room in the wee small hours, Charles realizes his feelings: ""Sophy's voice ceased; she looked up, and met Mr Rivenhall's eyes. He was staring at her, as though a thought, blinding in its novelty, had occurred to him. Her gaze remained steady, a little questioning. He rose abruptly, half-stretched out his hand, but let it fall again, and, turning, went quickly out of the room."" (75%) It might be sacrilegious to say it, but perhaps Sophy's too perfect. Sometimes a flaw is necessary to make a perfect character, if that makes any sense at all.Charles, on the other hand, has lots of flaws. But I liked him anyway. Heyer does a great job of portraying a young man thrust into much responsibility at a young age, with a ditsy mother and a profligate father. His reaction to all of that, is to allow his whole character to be shaped by the (genuine) seriousness of his task and the predicament of his family. Soppy brings him out of his shell. Slowly, we get glimpses of the man he might have been before. And, the man he will be with Sophy there to help him carry the load, or perhaps more appropriately, to help him see it doesn’t actually weigh that much in the first place. They compliment one another. Equally, one senses Charles will reign her in when her schemes threaten to run away with her and everyone around her. Then there’s the cast of secondary characters. Too many to even mention. My favourite? Fawnhope. The name alone is fantastic for a young wannabe-poet. His ability to find a (usually pretty terrible) line of poetry in anything and everything and his complete lack of regard for anything else: brilliant. The lazy marquessa! Eugenia! Sir Horace: somehow charming and rude at the same time, and the worst best father in literature.The flip side of that is the dreadful antisemitism in the portrayal of Goldhanger. But I won’t dwell on that. The book is what it is, undoubtedly (and I make no excuses, but it’s true) of its time. I’d still rather have the true picture of what Heyer wrote than a sanitised version and I’m glad the version I bought kept those parts, as I understand other versions have not.The story is fast paced and farcical and funny. It flies off the page but Heyer never loses her grip on it. Even though I had to pick up and put down this book more times than I can count because of work commitments, I never lost the thread either. It takes a masterful story teller to keep all those balls in the air and manage to finish with a flourish, which the trip to Sophy’s father’s house most definitely is. Everyone pitches up, and then some. Plus fluffy chicks.I have a small disappointment, in addition to Sophy’s too easy perfection and Goldhanger. The declarations. It wasn’t romantic enough for me. Perhaps I want this novel to be something it’s not. Perhaps I want Sophy to be something she’s not, but I did want more from the moment Charles and Sophy finally got together. That keeps this book from five stars.All in all though, top drawer Regency-ing, Heyer. Top drawer. "
40,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5063928-sophia,Rating 5 out of 5,"Tempestuous, irrepressible, and quirkily dazzling, Sophy has a charm that has made her one of Georgette Heyer's most memorable heroines. The Grand Sophy was one of the first Heyer novels I came across years ago and I was thrilled to come back to it in audio format. Sarah Woodward is a new to me narrator, but she brought the story vividly to life and I plunged into her voice work with as much pleasure as the story itself.The Grand Sophy is a Regency romp that takes place after the Napoleonic War. Sir Horace is a successful diplomat who worked on the Continent through much of the war and the peace after, but now must do His Majesty's business in South America. Up until now, this unorthodox man has had his daughter by his side. This time, he will not. He will leave his 'little Sophy' with his sister's family in London to introduce her to English society and find her a husband.Her relations are willing, but then they meet Sophy. Sophy can see rather swiftly that her aunt, her cousins, and the whole household are in dire need of her brand of help. Her oldest cousin has attached himself to a starched up dreary woman who makes everyone miserable, his sister fancies herself in love with an Adonis-like poet, and another cousin is hiding a secret burden. Oh yes, they need doing and she settles in to turn their lives upside down. Exotic pets, dashing horses and carriage, fashionable, well-connected, and something of an original, Miss Sophia Stanton-Lacey takes London by storm and not even her intelligent, sharp and dominating cousin Charles can out jockey her.What a winning gem of a Regency romp that isn't to be missed."

43,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/202724-jessica,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is among my favorites of Heyer's books, and one of the first I ever read. (I think I read The Convenient Marriage, The Corinthian, Sophy, and Cousin Kate, in that order, when Harlequin did those white covers in the late 1990's.) But I often hear people say that after reading this one, they could never read another Heyer, it was so gross, and I was startled. I mostly remembered the awful fiancée, Sophy being a capital whip and horsewoman, and her Italian greyhound trembling around. But again, it's been over twenty years. So I bought the audiobook with my monthly credit from Audiobooks.com, and I gave it a listen, with great delight, and then. . . yeah, I got to that scene. When Sophy confronts someone who can only be described as horrible Victorian caricature of a Jewish moneylender. He's devious, cowardly, cringing, greasy, and lives in squalor. What. The Hell. Why is this even there? This is like early Dickens, before some Jewish readers basically told him off (Fagin in Oliver Twist), and he apologized (Mr Riah in Our Mutual Friend). And frankly, as a reader and a writer, and even saying, ""Well, it was a different time."" the whole episode doesn't work for me. It's terribly mean-spirited, in every way, and the always calm and very clever Sophy sitting there threatening to murder a total stranger is completely out of character. It's a giant flaw in an otherwise flawless book, and I can't fathom how it got there and why it's stayed there. I've read (and reread) most of her other romances, and I've never come across something like this in another. The subplot around it, with Hubert owing money, Sophy getting it back for him, Charles getting back the earrings she pawned, Eugenia tattling, is all necessary. But the entire gross scene? Nope. Doesn't need to be there. Skip that bit. Staple those pages together in your copy. Skip ahead in the audiobook. Don't let this nastiness ruin the adventures of the Grand Sophy!"

A serving of a thousand more chapters please! ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つI would say the plot could have been better and a lot more things in that periphery. And in that regard, thus give this book 4 stars. But I can't seem to give it anything less than 5 stars for the amount of rich entrainment it provided me. And this level of writing certainly helps to alleviate the sullenness of the reader. Which I was in dire need, to get on with some productive work in these stand-still circumstantial times. I feel very fortunate to have made the unrequited acquaintance of Sophy. And was also immensely delighted in seeing the whole Ombersley family blossom in front of my eyes, especially Charles. Who slowly, layer by warm affectionate layer, reveals or rather grows in his true character. He was the caring, savage, ill-tempered but filial counterpart to our uncouth but very well-meaning Sophy.Oh, I could never have imagined being entertained so much by a historical victorian novel, but I was vehemently proved wrong.

47,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69903275-lacitty,Rating 3 out of 5,"La Heyer scrive sempre dei romanzi deliziosi. Non è alta letteratura, sono opere d'intrattenimento, ma sempre garbate e divertenti. Questo romanzo, per certi aspetti ha delle somiglianze con Emma di Jane Austen perché la protagonista ha la stessa verve e la stessa voglia di trovare un fidanzato/a a chi non ce l'ha; tuttavia il romanzo della Austen ha un altro spessore in termini analisi dei personaggi e delle situazioni che vivono. Tant'è, la Sophie della Heyer è una bottiglietta di energia, capace di scandalizzare la buona società londinese, ma passandola sempre liscia. Fa infuriare con sistematica periodicità il cugino, Charles, ma al momento giusto fa trionfare l'amore e i buoni sentimenti anche quando tutto sembra cospirare contro di lei. È un personaggio amabile, ma, come la maggior parte dei personaggi di questo romanzo, non ha sfaccettature. È buona e basta, così come, per esempio, la signorina Wraxton è insopportabile e basta.Pur avendo una trama ampiamente prevedibile, gli incidenti inventati dalla Heyer per arrivare al finale sono carini e originali.

Listened to the unabridged audiobook this time, a pure delight, just what I needed!8/2018 - Reread with Georgette Heyer group - listening to the audiobook this time. What fun! Still holds up for me in my top five favorite Heyer books. Both the hero, Charles, and the ending worked better for me compared to my last read - Charles still isn’t a favorite Heyer hero, but I sympathize more with him this time around - he’s got a lot on his plate!2015 - Reread this for the first time with the Georgette Heyer group, and it's fun to get their knowledgeable insight into one of my favorite authors! I've downgraded my five stars of many years ago to four just because I didn't really like the hero as much as some other GH heroes and the climactic ending was so hilariously twisted and involved it almost descended into farce for me - I kept picturing an elaborate stage set with spoon-wielding marquesas, flaky poets and gallant lovers holding ducklings or chicken eggs dashing across the stage in and out of doorways! (Hope there are no spoilers in there). Anyway, that's not necessarily a bad thing and nobody does this sort of drawing room comedy like Heyer, but I prefer her more subtle, dry humor (The Foundling) or out-and-out adventure (Devil's Cub, Toll-gate, Unknown Ajax).The Grand Sophy is the nickname (nom de guerre when she's on a crusade to ""help"" someone win their true love or confronting snooty fiancées or vicious loan sharks) of the heroine of one of Heyer's most popular comedies, and it suits her down to the ground! Sophy, unlike Charles the stuffed shirt, her cousin and unknown intended, IS one of my favorite Heyer characters of all time - a widowed diplomat's daughter, she has been along for the adventurous ride from one diplomatic crisis to another all over Europe, meeting soldiers, dignitaries and serving as her cavalier, dashing, flirtatious father's hostess. She readily admits that unlike most daintily bred, aristocratic misses in England she ""has no nerves whatsoever"", can drive and shoot to an inch, and fears no man (or woman!) She is more than a match for her unhappy relatives and begins to straighten out their lives as soon as she moves in while her father handles yet another diplomatic crisis in Brazil. Cousin Charles, eldest, stuffy, forced to take up the reins and right the family's crumbling fortunes after his wastrel father gambles them away, is engaged to one of the finest examples of a self-righteous, humorless, horse-faced sprig (prig?) of the aristocracy Heyer ever created, and that's saying something - I could cheerfully wring her scrawny neck, which would be easy since she is CONSTANTLY sticking it out where it's not wanted as she piously whispers poison into Charles' ear about his unworthy family and what he should do about them! Prim, prissy Eugenia annoys and upsets Charles' whole family but even worse, the couple plans to live in the family home upon their marriage! Stunningly beautiful, sweet-natured cousin Cecilia is in love with a gorgeous but flaky and impoverished poet who ""spouts poetry to her left eyebrow"" and can't see himself working at a productive occupation to provide for her as he is in constant thrall to his muse. Cousin Hubert clearly has things on his mind, which Sophy can see as soon as she arrives in Berkeley Square - currently an undergraduate at Oxford who incurred crippling debts last term which Charles had to settle, what has he gotten into now? And can Sophy force him to go to big brother Charles before it's too late, or at least accept her help? The Grand Sophy sets to work immediately, scheming, cajoling and plotting to match her cousins up happily, solve their problems, and even nurse her youngest cousin back to health!Fun, effervescent, fast-paced, I agree this is one of Heyer's best if not my personal favorite - Sophy is a character for the ages and worth the read alone!"
49,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28323108-jo-the-book-geek,Rating 2 out of 5,"Well, considering this is my first Georgette Heyer novel, I cannot deny that this has been a fairly dismal and forgettable experience. After spotting all of the glowing reviews, I thought I'd give it a chance, and baring in mind, I'm not one for the romance genre, but sadly, I've been left rather disappointed.The first thing that one notices almost immediately about this book is it's repetitiveness. I mean, twice I can forgive, but more than that, you're treading on dangerous territory. Sophy and Charles had an strange relationship, full of repetitiveness and an exhaustive amount of exclamation marks. Yes, exclamation marks. There is a such thing as an overuse, and Heyer did herself proud within these pages.Charles also appeared to be cold, and almost every chance he got, he was launching attacks at people, which quite frankly, showed his weakness, more than anything else. I mean, how could one possibly be in love with this man? Maybe it's a turn on that I've chosen to let slip through the net all of these years.As I delved further into this book I realised we had racial stereotyping and anti-semitism, which isn't something I expected, and to be honest, it added nothing to the story, and made me dislike it even further. Heyer definitely hasn't left a lasting impression on me, especially not the positive kind, and right now, I'm unsure whether I'll pick up another of her books in the future. "

The Grand Sophy is one of her best, less of a romance and more a comedy. Sophy is a vivid protagonist, full of intelligence, world experience and energy. Really, she has the makings of a monster and yet remains likeable. She comes into the lives of her aunt and cousins like a whirlwind and it is hilarious to witness how she manipulates them, often without their knowledge. The rest of the cast is very colourful too, memorable, and full of quirks, if a little stereotyped. Sophy's father is hilarious and his relationship and indeed confidence in her is unusual and refreshing. In one instance however, Heyer goes down the wrong path, in the portrayal of the evil money lender. This felt jarring, especially since the novel was written in 1950 and the author should have known better. Apart from this 'faux pas' (for want of a better word), Heyer excels in her dialogue and indeed the orchestration of her scenes, many displaying perfect timing for maximum effect, and offers us a very entertaining and funny read."

I listened to the audible - excellent narration by Louise Jameson.SOPHY ...It seemed to be non-stop all the way from the moment that Sophy arrived at the Rivenhall household.Sophy was absolutely wonderful (my kind of heroine - strong and independent).
""She was by far too tall; nose and mouth were both too large, and a pair of expressive gray eyes could scarcely be held to atone entirely for these defects. Only you could not forget Sophy, even though you could not recall the shape of her face, or the colour of her eyes.""

“You are shameless!” he said angrily.“Nonsense! You only say so because I drove your horses,” she answered. “Never mind! I will engage not to do so again.”“I’ll take care of that!” he retorted. “Let me tell you, my dear Cousin, that I should be better pleased if you would refrain from meddling in the affairs of my family!”“Now, that,” said Sophy, “I am very glad to know, because if ever I should desire to please you I shall know just how to set about it. I daresay I shan’t, but one likes to be prepared for any event, however unlikely.”He turned his head to look at her, his eyes narrowed, and their expression was by no means pleasant. “Are you thinking of being so unwise as to cross swords with me?” he demanded. “I shan’t pretend to misunderstand you, Cousin, and I will leave you in no doubt of my own meaning! If you imagine that I will ever permit that puppy to marry my sister, you have yet something to learn of me!”“Pooh!” said Sophy. “Mind your horses, Charles, and don’t talk fustian to me.”

53,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10326608-lindsay,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is a Regency-era romantic comedy with the eponymous Sophy entering the lives of her aunt, uncle and cousins, the Ombersleys, and basically doing a non-magical Mary Poppins on the poor unsuspecting family.Lord Ombersley is a useless gambler who has long since abdicated his role in the family and Lady Ombersley is of delicate and nervous constitution and frets over everything. That leaves it all on their eldest son Charles who is desperately trying to navigate his family out of financial ruin while attempting to perform the role of both his parents to their large brood, including his beautiful sister Cecilia who was about to be engaged with a very good match, but instead has set her sights on an incredibly handsome, but utterly vacuous poet. There's also his brother Hubert who is in deep trouble with a criminal moneylender and four other younger children besides.Charles is humorless with his family and most of them are terrified of him, some of which is because of his horrible fiance Eugenia (she almost deserves her name), who is overly proper, extremely judgemental and a gossip besides.Into all of that walks Sophia Stanton-Lacy, the well-travelled 20 year old daughter of Lady Ombersley's diplomat brother. She can ride, she can drive a carriage, she can shoot, she knows and is known by most of high society and the nobility and she has all the confidence of ten other people. Her father has brought her to the Ombersleys for her sister to help find her a husband, but Sophy very quickly decides that her main role is to fix the Ombserleys. Comedy ensues, not least of which because the hapless Ombersleys are so committed to stuffing themselves up, but Sophy is a force of nature in the face of setbacks.Charles immediately sets himself against her, and many of Sophy's setbacks in trying to help the family are because of his interference. This could easily make him the villain of the piece, but his motivations are just and he finds himself appreciating Sophy more and more throughout. The author cleverly codes him as ""not-the-bad-guy"" early by showing how good Charles is with animals. He's also not an idiot and learns reasonably quickly the sort of things that Sophy is capable of and both appreciates and anticipates them. Most of the fun in this book for me is watching these two clash and spar and have so much fun with each other.I will add the obligatory warning of antisemitism here. The criminal moneylender is clearly a Jew with some of the worst stereotypes of antisemitism on display. I'm not going to excuse it; it's indeed egregious. As has been said elsewhere, a book coming out in 1950 should have done better. In fact, it's a real fly in the soup of an otherwise great novel."

It's still charming and makes me smile almost the entire way through, though the amount of times they take God's name in vain is more noticeable -- and, for me, annoying -- when listening to the audio. I haven't particularly liked any other Heyer novel I've read, but this one is a gem.Original Review:How are you supposed to review a book this fantastic? It's hilarious and witty and I adore the characters - Sophy for being Sophy; Rivenhall because he's rough and blunt and boxes (I know some people don't like him because of his temper, but I'm contrary and do); Charlbury for catching mumps and being chivalrous. I would, however, like to beat Miss Wraxton over the head with a cricket bat - or marry her off to Fawnhope, which would be a still worse fate."
55,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17629329-leah,Rating 5 out of 5,"Feisty heroine meets swoonworthy hero…When Sir Horace Stanton-Lacy is sent to Brazil on a diplomatic mission, he leaves his daughter Sophy in the care of his sister, Lady Ombersley, with the clear instruction that she is to find Sophy a husband. But Sophy is no shy ingénue – she has spent her life travelling around Europe with her father and is very capable of taking care of herself. And of everyone else around her, which comes in very useful when she decides that her cousins all have problems that, with a little effort, she can solve…It took me a few chapters to warm to Sophy. She’s super-confident and a complete extrovert, and no one could deny she’s an interfering type, poking her nose into things that are really none of her business even if she’s doing it with the best of intentions. But gradually, like most of the characters, I fell under her spell and began to thoroughly enjoy her meddling! And the members of this family certainly need someone to interfere in their lives before they all made irremediable mistakes. There’s Cecilia, whose eminently suitable admirer catches mumps just before he is due to propose, leaving her susceptible to the entirely unsuitable charms of wannabe romantic poet, Augustus Fawnhope. Young Hubert has got himself involved with a moneylender and is becoming desperate, but can’t bring himself to ask for help from his forbidding elder brother, Charles. Charles himself has inherited all the money in the family and with it, all the responsibility for his somewhat feckless, though affectionate, parents and siblings. This has extinguished all the fun in his personality and he is well on the way to becoming a family tyrant. To make matters worse, he has got himself engaged to the awful Miss Wraxton, a goody-two-shoes and sneak of the worst kind, always telling tales to him of the peccadilloes of his siblings and stirring up trouble among them all. Sophy has her work cut out, but is supremely confident that she knows what’s best for them all and sets out to save them all from themselves. Along the way, there will be balls and dancing, lots of horses and carriages, glimpses of the Royal Princes, somnolent Spanish señoras, rakes and fortune-hunters, and military men galore! Not to mention the dog and the monkey! And the reader, who will quickly decide who should all end up marrying whom, will not be disappointed!I always look on Heyer as literary chicken soup, something to take on those days when the world seems grey. Her humour and the liveliness of her characters is so entertaining, and her heroines are delightfully feisty without ever losing their feminine charm. Her heroes are swoonworthy (in the moment – I try to gloss over how their more objectionable character traits might return once the first flush of romantic love wears off) and the right people always end up with the right people! She even finds suitable matches for the people we don’t like, so everyone ends up happy. And usually there aren’t any real villains, or at least not among the main characters, so although we might frown on the fortune-hunters we’re still quite happy when they find their fortune, while the rakes are rakish without doing anything really reprehensible, so we’re allowed to quite like them too. The men might be feckless in matters of wooing but they are heroically brave and full of gentlemanly courtesy – sigh! After my initial hesitation Sophy turned into a wonderfully enjoyable heroine, and this turned into one of my favourite Heyers, falling very definitely into the category of all’s well that ends well! Great fun!www.fictionfanblog.wordpress.com "

Now it's become one of my favorites.Sophy is proper and polite, yet still scheming and rebellious. I really settled into Heyer's tone much faster in this one than in Frederica. I took great joy in the characters and plot. I kept reading late into the night simply because I wanted to know what would happen next -- the best kinds of books are those in which I never know what's coming!After reading this, I officially love Heyer's regency romances better than Austen's, and I honestly think her books are more of a pleasure to read. It's a very rare thing for a book to make me laugh aloud -- but as I read this I grinned and giggled many times at the antics of these characters, loving even those bumbling fools at which we are meant to scoff. Heyer had me hooked until the very end, when I finished with another squeal of delight. Heyer develops her male characters much more than Austen, offering more of those secret hints of love, while still keeping them delightfully subtle. While Austen can drone on and on with excessive descriptions and rather dull/dry details, Heyer's characters are always lively and present, and their emotions leap off the page. Frankly, Mr. Darcy has a run for his money against Charles Rivenhall... *Be still my beating heart!*And I love the friendships that are portrayed in here as well. See how the adorable romance with the trusting Charlbury and Cecilia is developed:""Mr. Fawnhope's handsome face and engaging smile might dazzle the female eye, but Mr Fawnhope had not yet learnt the art of conveying to a lady the gratifying impression that he considered her a fragile creature, to be cherished, and in every way considered. Lord Charlbury might be constitutionally incapable of addressing her as Nymph, or of comparing bluebells unfavourably with her eyes, but Lord Charlbury would infallibly provide a cloak for her if the weather were inclement, lift her over obstacles she could well climb without assistance, and in every way convince her that in his eyes she was a precious being whom it was impossible to guard too carefully.""

God, what a cast of characters, and how ridiculous they all are -- Sophy is fantastic, with her matchmaking and her provoking ways and her complete disregard for propriety. I loved the relationship between her and Charles -- the last few chapters made me positively hoot with laughter.I'm sure that people who would never like this genre won't be convinced by this, but I think I'm being brought to get over my original feelings by Heyer's work. It's well written, well paced, and hilariously funny: Sophy's matchmaking rather pokes fun at the genre, I think: she seems to consider people's lives as though they're in a novel and figures out what they would/could do if they were fictional. I half-wanted her to carry everything off, and half-wanted everything to end in a magnificent tangle that would teach her a lesson.As with Mary Stewart's work, I wrinkled my nose a little at the potential for cousin-marrying and all that sort of thing, but given the setting, it makes perfect sense."

The first two books I'd read didn't impress me and I didn't think much of those characters. Then I stumbled upon Frederica and really wished that it wasn't just good luck. Well, I can say now that it wasn't an accident because The Grand Sophy is just as entertaining, lovely, humorous and occasionally over the top as Frederica, maybe even more.From the start, when her father asks his sister to take care of her while he is in Brazil, you know you are in for a treat. The way he understates her personality is hilarious. His 'taking little thing' arrives with her monkey, a dog and her larger than life personality and the Ombersleys get help they didn't even know they needed.This is a humorous book with exaggerated situations and people and I enjoyed it very much.It might even work for people who don't usually read romance because there is so little of it here. You get it in the end, of course, but the book itself is more about the family and Sophy's way of dealing with problems. "

Every character (and there are a lot!) sounds like themselves--you would not mistake a line spoken by Sophy to be a line spoken by, say, Cecilia. This is true even for minor characters. The humour is solid. When it comes to comedy in romance, Georgette Heyer, in my opinion, is second to none. The world-building is exquisite. If you haven't read Heyer yet, and you like a little light historical, romantic and comedic escapism, you shouldn't miss this. "

Not my favorite Heyer but a good read.On this reread I'm upping my star rating from 4 to 5. I thoroughly enjoyed it this time round.

It is highly entertaining in the Victorian - Austenian way.Head-strong, unconventional Sophy is left by his father at her Aunt's House so that she introduces her to society and to start thinking of finding her a suitable husband. But Sophy has other plans which change all the lives of her dear cousins. Love or gambling problems are nothing to her, she moves soothingly around and gives comfort to those in need without thinking of herself.But won't she find happiness for herself surprisingly with the person she might have least thought of?Told in an almost casual way, with the apparent pose of the true Victorian times, I followed Sophy's cunning manoeuvrings to get her objectives with a half smile plastered on my face. Even though I knew what would happen after having read 20 pages it was a pleasure to read how she managed it in the end!I found the narrative easy, refreshing and perfect for a light read for those who love Austen and Victorian novels.Enjoy!"
64,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3947172-vivian,Rating 3 out of 5,"Sophy is a force to be reckoned with.I enjoyed this a great deal. Sophy was a charming, good-natured, and manipulative heroine. It was impressive to watch her straighten out the Ombersley's household, almost like watching a magician pull the cloth off a fully laden table. Her feats are rather bold and daring, and in some ways unrealistic. Charles, the sourpuss cousin with the weight of the family on his shoulders, was rather a prig and his betrothed, Eugenia even more so--Ugh. While I enjoyed Sophy's antics I found the wrap up less satisfying. Frankly, Sir Horace was far more interesting than any of the other male characters. I guess, I've been spoiled because Freddy from 
Cotillon
 was amazing--practically perfect if every way. I guess if you're a fan of fixing them up kind of romance than this is a win, but I tend to be more prosaic or lazy and assume what you see is about as good as it will ever get. Overall, entertaining and a bit madcap at times."
65,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1072582-kaethe,Rating 4 out of 5,"I didn't expect it to be so funny. More like The Importance of Being Earnest than, if you will, a generic recency romance. Heyer does a marvelous job of showing her lovers to be truly well-suited to one another, even the horrible characters. If not for the appalling anti-Semitic subplot (and honestly, a decent writer would blush to present such a shallow stereotype as a character) it would be a great story. Why it hasn't been filmed half a dozen times puzzles me. It's easy to imagine a number of opportunities to show off the leads as attractive to a modern audience: the guy is a boxer, although it's never shown in the book. And so many great character roles! Pity. Perhaps the popularity of the Bridgertons will change that.Library copy"

I know you were born before WWI and started writing when Hitler was just an unhappy art student, but you lived into the 1970s, so I expect more from you. The baldly anti-Semitic, cliched ""money lender"" in this book is shameful. Shameful that you committed it to paper once -- in 1950! -- and shameful that you never, never thought to amend it in later additions. The only remote upside is that it does provide a powerful reminder that at one point, your bigotry was so widespread and acceptable that no one blinked an eye at this dirty, cowardly, villainous Jewish character.

'I don't: I dislike you excessively!' he said savagely. Entranced by these lover-like words, Miss Stanton-Lacy returned his embrace with fervour, and meekly allowed herself to be led off to the stables.This would be the only meek thing Sophy did throughout this whole book.

Apesar de ser um livro com um final previsível, não é meloso nem xaropento, e as farpas trocadas entre Charles e Sophy foram deliciosas de ler. "
69,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51887975-pragya-singh,Rating 5 out of 5,"Another gem from the master writer! The indomitable, unconventional, witty Miss Sophia Stanton-Lacy just took my breath away. Fiercely independent (she drives her own sporty carriage, even manages her own money and goes to the bank (this in the 1800s!)), Sophy is always scheming to make the lives of everyone she loves better. She may remind some of Emma Wodehouse but while Emma has no real understanding of human nature and makes a big mess of everything (might as well say it out loud, Emma is my least favorite Austen heroine), Sophy is perceptive and shrewd, and capable of deep empathy and kindness. But enough fawning over Sophy- I can hardly add anything of novelty there. After going through some commentaries and reviews, I discovered that many readers don’t find Charles Rivenhall quite swoon-worthy enough and consider the Sophie-Charles pairing to be somewhat abrupt and uninspired. I just have to say that I WHOLEHEARTEDLY DISAGREE!!! And now I feel compelled to set the record straight and make everyone see the error of their ways. ;-) :-DWARNING: AN EXTREMELY LONG CHARLES RIVENHALL RAVE COMING THROUGH + PLENTY OF SPOILERSHe is the responsible elder son: In the first chapter we learn that Charles, the eldest son of Lord Ombersley (who has impoverished his estate with his gambling addiction) having inherited a fortune from his uncle has come to become very influential in all matters of the family, at times to the embarrassment of one or both his parents. But very quickly, we realize that Mr. Charles Rivenhall is no John Dashwood, and he is using his influence to effectively manage his father’s estate, to pay his gambling debts and to provide for his brothers and sisters. Even Lady Ombersley (not fully aware of the extent of her husband’s debt) who is generally inclined to think of Charles’ strictures and economies as disagreeable, is charitable enough to say that there is not an unpaid bill in the house since Charles took over. And while he is at odds with his sister over what he considers an imprudent attachment for her, his younger siblings adore him. I had no doubt that despite his betrothal, the grave Charles, who having been prematurely encumbered with familial responsibilities had lost touch with the lighter side of life, was set out to be the hero of this story (even before the grand Sophy makes an entrance).Dog and monkey love him: Enter Sophy with her menagerie of pets- dog, parrot and a monkey (that’s right, a monkey!). Her greyhound Tina develops an ill-judged passion for his society and is always frisking gaily at his heels. In one of the most comic scenes in the book, the monkey Jacko escapes from the schoolroom and goes up a curtain and it is complete bedlam until Mr. Rivenhall walks in and coolly commands the monkey to come down. Jacko cautiously descends and puts his arms around Mr. Rivenhall’s neck in a gesture of affection which leads Sophy to say “There is some magic in you which makes all animals trust you.”See, animals trust him. Now, I ask you, can there be a better judge of character than a dog and a monkey? ;-)Sophy could not believe that he was past reclaim, for not only had Tina made friends with him, but when he laughed, his whole personality underwent a change.So do his younger siblings: Remember when Amabel was sick and the only family member that she wanted close was not her mother or her sister but her brother Charles? And it’s such a cute scene when he is all dressed up for the ball and his two kid sisters’ hanging over the banisters are like ‘Charles, you look so smart, who can be smarter than you’ and he laughs and becomes all gay and promises to send ices up to their schoolroom.And he is so protective of them all. Hubert’s accusation is also barely concealed admiration of his brother “It is just like you, Charles, to shoulder everything, and to suppose no one can do the least thing but yourself.”I have read only two Heyer books so far and already I am wary of comparisons with Austen but also realize that they are inevitable. This one seems like a noteworthy difference in their styles- while Austen largely ignores the family and the younger siblings not of age (who remembers the name of Miss Dashwoods’ youngest sister?), Heyer harnesses the power of the family unit (children, pets, butlers) to not only create delicious comedy but also to establish character through these associations. The best example of the first kind (comedy) in this book is when Sophy is being roasted by her cousins for being the recipient of Lord Bromford’s attentions. He (Lord Bromford) stayed for half an hour, imparting information to his hosts on such varied topics as the vegetation in Jamaica, and the effect of paregoric draughts upon the human system, and the Rivenhalls listened to him in indignation until Sophy entered the room. Then the scales fell from before their eyes, and they perceived why his lordship had honored them with a morning-call, and their boredom changed to unholy glee.UNHOLY GLEE!! Lol..I must have spent a full ten minutes laughing at this! I can imagine this scene playing right in front of my eyes. Continuing….Sophy’s beau became in a trice the solid foundation upon which a lively set of young persons built the most preposterous of fabrications. No street-singer could lift his voice in the Square but what Hubert or Cecilia would declare it to be Lord Bromford, serenading Sophy; when he was confined to his house for three days with an internal disorder he was held to have fought a duel for the sake of her fine eyes; and the serial story of his adventures in the West Indies, conceived, added-to, and improved upon by three fertile brains, grew so outrageous as to draw protests from Lady Ombersley and Miss Adderbury.So much family fun!He is Mr. Dependable: Coming back to Charles, this is what his best friend Mr. Wychbold tells Sophy about him “There is no one I would rather go to in a fix than Charles Rivenhall.”His relationship with Cecilia and Hubert is strained at first but it takes only a gentle Sophian nudge to show his tender, amiable side: One day he is giving angry looks to his sister for taking a walk in the park with the poet (because of misrepresentations by the odious Miss Wraxton who delights in setting him up against his family) and the very next, he is calling her by her nursery pet names and laughing with her and then getting all big-brotherly with “Does that fellow Wraxton annoy you?”And his mortification at hearing Hubert say “if I had been better acquainted with you, I would have told you” is so obvious and so touching. Sophy and Charles’ first scene alone in each other’s company is EPIC: Charles is left STUNNED- he is just not used to such irreverence! But also so completely diverted by her forthrightness and skills with the horses. …much must be forgiven a girl who could handle his grays as Sophy had. From being a female sunk below reproach Sophy became rapidly an unconventional girl whose unaffected manners were refreshing in an age of simpers and high flights. They go on to have such awesome comic scenes together: In almost all these confrontations, Sophie bests Charles and then Charles calls her names and shows himself all vexed but it’s clear that her wit is making an impression! I am convinced that they have fun together even as neither of them, especially Charles, would dream of admitting it. Charles: We were doing very well before you began to turn this house upside-downSophy: What in the world have I done?Charles: (at a loss to think of anything tangible) Well, you brought that monkey here for one thingSophy: But Charles, just the other day, you were feeding Jacko bits of apple, teaching him tricks and warning the children to give him a blanket at nightCharles: (biting his lip) who told you that?Charles: Stop telling my sisters that my fiancée has a face like a horseSophy: But Charles, Miss Wraxton is not to be blamed for this, I have always pointed this out to your sistersCharles: I consider her countenance as particularly well-bredSophy: Yes, I meant like a particularly well-bred horseCharles: You meant to belittle Miss Wraxton and you know itSophy: But Charles, you know how fond I am of horsesCharles (before he can stop himself from replying): But Selina who repeated this to me is not fond of horses���..(breaks off realizing how absurd it is to continue!)Sophy: I expect she will be when she has lived in the same house with Miss Wraxton for a month or twoAt this point, Mr. Rivenhall restrained an impulse to box Sophy’s ears and flung out of the room slamming the door behind him. When Charles plans his little revenge: This is sooooo good, it needs to be quoted word-for-word. Continuing from above----At the foot of the stairs he encountered Lord Bromford, who was handing his hat and overcoat to a footman. Mr. Rivenhall, seeing how he might, in some measure, be revenged on Sophy, greeted him with a great affability, asked him if he meant to attend Tuesday’s ball and upon hearing that his lordship was much looking forward to the engagement, said: “Have you come to bespeak my cousin’s hand to the cotillion? You are wise! She will certainly be besieged with solicitations! Dassett, you will find Miss Stanton-Lacy in the Yellow Saloon! Take his lordship up to her!”And when Sophy refuses the dance with Bromford making up a prior engagement, he protests: “How can this be, when your cousin told me to make haste to be the first with you?”“My cousin Charles? Did he indeed?” said Sophy appreciatively. Love it when the all-serious, all-upright guy goes rogue!He has a sense of humor: Besides getting angry, he can also laugh at the ridiculous. Just picture him digging his hands deep in his pockets to avoid breaking into a laugh right in front of Lord Brumford!They love horses and enjoy shooting and both frequently express a desire to box the other’s ears  - if that’s not love, IDK what is! :-DAlso, somewhat minor point- however stuffy Charles maybe, he falls into easy conversation about sports with her redcoat friends and totally gets along with them. Sophy smiled benignly to see her friends and her cousin so happily absorbed. He cares for her: Neither Sophy nor the reader are deceived that Charles ‘grows cold with apprehension’ and rides along full speed to Hyde Park- all because he is concerned about the knees of his young, headstrong horse.Other than this small contrived incident, Charles doesn’t exactly rescue Sophy from any scrapes (unlike a lot of other regency heroes and I suspect that this is what fuels most of the ‘what does she see in him’ talk). But why should he be expected to? Sophy is the firebrand, she is the fixer of problems. Charles coming to her rescue would be completely at odds with her character.He knows her better than anyone: He always knows what she is up to! “If that Spanish woman is not also at Lacy Manor at this moment I give you leave to call me a blockhead!” (*Digression*- I always read this line with a proper English accent. This book creates such lively imagery, I think it is perfectly suited to be adapted as a play or a motion picture.)  'No, I don’t think I shall be disappointed’, said Mr. Rivenhall, with a sudden and rueful grin. ‘Shocked, maddened, and stunned perhaps, but not disappointed!’She is perfectly aware of his feelings for her and also the fix he is in: And Sophy being Sophy, the eternal optimist and go-getter has a scheme to save both brother and sister from their hastily entered engagements. It doesn’t work out exactly the way she plans but it’s actually better with Eugenia Wraxton also finding a match in the process. There’s a funny scene in the end when Sophy calls out to Sir Vincent before she is dragged away by Charles to give her portmanteau to Miss Wraxton to make use of its contents as she pleases. Yeah, I am taking your fiancée, might as well give you my portmanteau!!
So, to conclude
: Charles and Sophy- made for each other. They are so well-suited too, they both have forceful personalities which can check each other’s excesses. And yes, the romance is understated but when is the romance obvious in regency era novels? They are all about an undercurrent of emotions and sudden epiphanies (usually aided by the object of affection being a stand-up guy/gal in time of a crisis; sick children often do the trick ;-)). As Frederica says “I don’t know what it’s like being in love. Is it being- not very comfortable- and cross- and not quite happy, when you aren’t there?”As always, a bevy of unique and interesting secondary characters: the Marquesa who is not embarrassed to sleep right under the eyes of her guests, adorable Lord Charbury (the man who would contract mumps would do anything!), Fawnhope, the hopeless poet over whom all the ladies fawn (see what I did there ;-)), the rakish Sir Vincent who is surprisingly observant (he seems to know what’s going on between Charles and Sophy before anyone else), silly and pretentious Lord Bromford with all his Jamaica talk. Sigh…good books make it so hard to go back to reality! I need a sequel. And a movie. And retirement, preferably in an English cottage so that I can re-read this and gorge on all the other Heyers!"
70,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18940246-sotiris-karaiskos,Rating 3 out of 5,"The author of this book was known for her romantic historical novels that are taking place in the regency era and was inspired by Jane Austen. What exactly means ""inspired"" I could not quite understand but surely this subject is not indifferent to me and in combination with the good reviews I have read, made me want to read some of her books. Reading this book, which is her most popular book, I have found out a few things. The first is that this inspiration from Jane Austen has in no way led to copying. There are, of course, some common elements such as the satirical mood, but the way of writing and style in general has nothing to do with it. Instead of the minute, ironic humour, we find the humour that we would expect in a comedy of the time that the book was written, instead of realism and restraint, we find situations more unusual, instead of the slow pace, big dialogues and the analyses, we find a more straight approach, less reflection and more action. This, on the one hand, is good as copying would rather lead to a ridiculous effect and it is good that there is greater authenticity, on the other hand, however, this different way the author gives is cut off from the literature of the era of the story.The second is that the author has studied quite a lot of the era. In the pages of the book we find many small and big details of the life of the era and there is a general willingness to carry us in this time period in the best way. On the other hand, however, the book describes situations that are completely different from what would allow the customs of the time. The central theme of the book is that Sophy, the heroine of the book, that comes into the life of an ordinary aristocratic family and upsets it with her independent spirit, challenging their conservative beliefs with her actions. Surely this is the basis for an interesting and fun story but I do not think it has anything to do with reality. Certainly at that time women were able to claim certain things in their limited domestic role, but it would be very strange for a woman to have the freedoms and behavior of our heroine. I feel that the writer has written more something that suits the climate of her time than this of the time she describes.The third is that this book was not very attractive to me at the end. At first I liked it enough but as I moved through it I found fewer interesting things and so I ended up finishing the book just because I felt compelled to do it. The situations, as I said, seemed excessive to me, the dialogues hasty and the supposedly basic theme of a book of this genre - romance - is minimal, which greatly reduces the emotional effect of the book. I do not know, of course, if her other books are different but the impression from this book does not create the need for me to go further. Nevertheless, the book has some virtues, I can not say it is bad, and certainly its heroine is a very interesting character and the description of her activity is definitely fun, so I will be more lenient in my score.Η συγγραφέας αυτού του βιβλίου ήταν γνωστή την εποχή της για τα ρομαντικά ιστορικά μυθιστορήματα της που διαδραματίζονταν την εποχή της αντιβασιλείας και ήταν εμπνευσμένα από την Jane Austen. Τι ακριβώς σημαίνει ""εμπνευσμένα"" δεν μπόρεσα ακριβώς να το καταλάβω αλλά σίγουρα αυτή η θεματολογία δεν μου είναι καθόλου αδιάφορη και σε συνδυασμό με τις καλές κριτικές που διάβασα με έκανε να θέλω να ασχοληθώ με τα βιβλία. Διαβάζοντας αυτό το βιβλίο, που είναι και το δημοφιλέστερο της, διαπίστωσα αρκετά πράγματα. Το πρώτο είναι ότι αυτή η έμπνευση από την Jane Austen με κανέναν τρόπο δεν οδήγησε στην αντιγραφή. Υπάρχουν, βέβαια, κάποια κοινά στοιχεία όπως η σατιρική διάθεση αλλά ο τρόπος γραφής και γενικότερα το ύφος δεν έχει καμία σχέση. Αντί για το λεπτό, ειρωνικό χιούμορ συναντάμε το χιούμορ που θα περιμέναμε σε μία κωμωδία της εποχής που γράφτηκε το βιβλίο, αντί για το ρεαλισμό και την αυτοσυγκράτηση συναντάμε καταστάσεις περισσότερο ασυνήθιστες, αντί για τους αργούς ρυθμός, τους μεγάλους διαλόγους και τις αναλύσεις έχουμε μία πιο ευθεία προσέγγιση, λιγότερο προβληματισμό και περισσότερη δράση. Αυτό, από τη μία μεριά, είναι καλό καθώς η αντιγραφή θα οδηγούσε μάλλον σε ένα γελοίο αποτέλεσμα και καλό είναι που υπάρχει μεγαλύτερη αυθεντικότητα, από την άλλη, όμως, αυτό το διαφορετικό που δίνει η συγγραφέας είναι αποκομμένο από τη λογοτεχνία της εποχής που διαδραματίζεται η ιστορία.Το δεύτερο είναι ότι η συγγραφέας έχει μελετήσει αρκετά την εποχή. Μέσα στις σελίδες του βιβλίου συναντάμε πολλές μικρές και μεγάλες λεπτομέρειες από τη ζωή της εποχής και υπάρχει γενικότερα μία διάθεση να μας μεταφέρει σε αυτή τη χρονική περίοδο με τον καλύτερο τρόπο. Από την άλλη, όμως, το βιβλίο περιγράφει καταστάσεις που είναι εντελώς διαφορετικές από αυτό που θα επέτρεπαν τα ήθη της εποχής. Το κεντρικό θέμα του βιβλίου είναι πως η Sophy, η ηρωίδα του βιβλίου, έρχεται στη ζωή μιας συνηθισμένης αριστοκρατικής οικογένειας και την αναστατώνει με το ανεξάρτητο πνεύμα της, προκαλώντας τις συντηρητικές πεποιθήσεις τους με τις πράξεις της. Σίγουρα αυτό είναι μία βάση για μία ενδιαφέρουσα και διασκεδαστική ιστορία αλλά δεν νομίζω ότι έχει καμία σχέση με την πραγματικότητα. Σίγουρα εκείνη την εποχή οι γυναίκες ήταν σε θέση να διεκδικήσουν κάποια πράγματα μέσα στον περιορισμένο οικιακό τους ρόλο αλλά θα ήταν πολύ περίεργο για μία γυναίκα να έχει της ελευθερίες και τη συμπεριφορά της ηρωίδας μας. Δηλαδή νιώθω ότι η συγγραφέας έγραψε περισσότερο κάτι που να ταιριάζει στα δεδομένα της εποχής της παρά σε αυτά της εποχής που περιγράφει.Το τρίτο είναι ότι αυτό το βιβλί�� δεν μου ήταν και πολύ ελκυστικό τελικά. Στην αρχή μου άρεσε αρκετά αλλά όσο προχωρούσα έβρισκα όλο και λιγότερα ενδιαφέροντα πράγματα και έτσι κατέληξα να τελειώσω το βιβλίο μόνο και μόνο γιατί ένιωθα υποχρεωμένος να το κάνω. Οι καταστάσεις, όπως είπα, μου φάνηκαν υπερβολικές, οι διάλογοι βιαστικοί και το υποτιθέμενο βασικό θέμα ενός βιβλίου αυτού του είδους - ο ρομαντισμός - ελάχιστος, κάτι που μειώνει αρκετά τη συναισθηματική επίδραση του βιβλίου. Δεν ξέρω, βέβαια, αν τα άλλα βιβλία της είναι διαφορετικά αλλά σίγουρα η εντύπωση από αυτό το βιβλίο δεν μο�� δημιουργεί την ανάγκη να προχωρήσω περισσότερο στο έργο της. Παρόλα αυτά το βιβλίο έχει κάποιες αρετές, δεν μπορώ να πω ότι είναι κακό, και σίγουρα η ηρωίδα του είναι ένας χαρακτήρας πολύ ενδιαφέρον και η περιγραφή της δραστηριότητάς της σίγουρα είναι διασκεδαστική, για αυτό και θα είμαι περισσότερο επιεικής στη βαθμολογία μου."
71,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1406509-laurel,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Grand Sophy is a devilishly fine girl! First published in 1950, The Grand Sophy contains one of Georgette Heyer’s most endearingly outrageous heroines. In this newly released reissue by Sourcebooks, you are in for a rollicking good time through Regency era London with Miss Sophia Stanton-Lacy. As one of her many male admirers proclaims, ""By all that is wonderful, it’s the Grand Sophy!"" Too true. A diplomat’s daughter, Sophy has traveled the Continent with her widowed father Sir Horace Stanton-Lacy following the British army in their pursuit of Napoleon during the Peninsular War. Two years have passed since the Monster of Elba was finally defeated and Sir Horace’s duties now take him abroad to South America. He feels it is time for Sophy to marry, and who better than to present his motherless daughter to London society than his amiable sister, Lady Ombersley. But, will her eldest son Charles approve? Things in her dysfunctional family are so oddly arranged. Her indifferent husband Bernard Rivenhall, Lord Ombersley has run through his fortune, and now relies on his eldest son Charles, who inherited another estate, to pay his debts and finance his household. Charles, known for his ill temper and tight pocketbook, is engaged to equally priggish young woman, Miss Eugenia Wraxton, whose rigid grasp on social stricture is at odds with everyone who she deigns to look down her very long equine nose at. Lady Ombersley’s beautiful young daughter Cecilia should marry the very eligible and wealthy Lord Charlbury, but prefers instead the handsome poet Augustus Fawnhope whose odds at fame and fortune are slim as his picking a Derby winner. Her second son Hurbert, whose moods sway with the tides of his debt, is ensconced with dubious money-lenders and in need of extraction. They all live a dull life according to Charles’s autocratic commands. If ever there was a family in need of a make-over, the Rivenhall’s present a tall bill. Enter The Grand Sophy. Quick, intelligent and exuberantly capable, twenty-year old Sophy is a bracing reveille to her cousin’s the Rivenhall’s staid existence at Berkeley Square. From the moment she arrives on her aunt’s doorstep elegantly attired with her entourage of a dog, a horse, a monkey, a parrot, a groom, a maid and a mountain of luggage, they are left with no uncertainty that this is no ordinary young lady. Outspoken and unafraid to stretch the edge of decorum, Miss Stanton-Lacy sizes up the household’s problems and sets about to make them right, much to the chagrin of her cousin Charles and his meddlesome fiancée Miss Wraxton, who thinks she’s a hoyden. Sophy is fearless in the face of propriety venturing beyond the constraints of the Regency women’s world visiting banks, buying horses, a Phaeton carriage, and planning and paying for her coming out Ball, all the while pushing her cousin Charles’ buttons at every turn. Their repartees are absolutely hilarious – Sophy almost always in command of the final outcome – and Charles not knowing what hit him. Life as the Rivenhall’s had known it has been quite undone. Along the way, Sophy has a great deal of fun, and so do we. 'Life at Berkeley Square had become all at once full of fun and excitement. Even Lord Ombersley was aware of it. “By God, I don’t know what’s come over you all, for the place was used to be as lively as a tomb!”'Visiting Regency London is always a treat through Georgette Heyer’s astute eye. Her historical references are quite amazing. The descriptions of clothing, fabrics and furnishing were sumptuous. Her attention to the details of Regency carriages and horsemanship, was spot on. The plot kept me turning pages quickly, eager to see what Sophy’s next antic would be, and which couples would be together by the conclusion of the novel. Through Sophy’s exuberant personality we meet a heroine whose qualities of self assurance, conviction and zest for life are infectious. I had to laugh out loud when even the stuffy Rivenhall butler Dassett acknowledged that Sophy is a gem. “I venture to say, she is a lady as knows precisely how things should be done. A great pleasure, if I may be pardoned the liberty, to work for Miss Sophy, for she thinks of everything, and I fancy there will be no hitch to mar the festivities.” Yes, The Grand Sophy knows precisely how things should be done, and I would not have it any other way. This was by far my most enjoyable read this year. Fun, engaging and hilarious, I can not recommend it more highly. Sophy is a devilishly fine girl.Laurel Ann, Austenprose"
72,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4784586-andrea,Rating 5 out of 5,"There are heroines you are repeatedly told are independent and capable who somehow end up putting themselves in danger all day long because someone tells them they can't do something or because they just think too highly of their abilities, and then there is Sophy. Sophy who knows her limits and only gets herself in situations she has already thought her way out of. And that is why I love her. She's that rare brand of heroine who is truly independent and loveable. And, unlike Jane Austen's Emma, she only meddles in peoples' lives when she is truly right in thinking they need all the help they can get. I adore her. I want to be like her when I grow up. And our hero Charles? He is one of those adorably stuffy heroes who are horrified when a loveable whirlwind materializes out of nowhere and turns their orderly lives upside down, all the way protesting that she is too much, and he does NOT like her. At all. In the beginning, he might come across as high-handed and arrogant, but once you get to know his story and see where he is coming from, it makes sense he is the way he is. And, because this is a Georgette Heyer book, there is actual character development! He doesn't magically change overnight because of love, it happens gradually and naturally. In fact, he doesn't realize his feelings until very late in the book. Which is another reason I love this book. Not only do characters grow, there is actual talking, fixing issues through communication, and people truly get to know each other before they fall in love. There's adorable bickering, a capable heroine who breathes some much-needed life into a family that is slowly falling to pieces, and a lot of fun to be had! One of my favorite Georgette Heyer books!Buddy re-read with Lacey"
73,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11762474-jultri,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5/5, marked up for the excellent narration. Likely inspired by Austen's Emma, and like Emma, Sophy was much too cocky and meddlesome for my liking. Charles, her first cousin and our hero, was too staid and boring and there were absolutely no chemistry between them until the last scene where they did the obligatory pash. There was no longing look, no agonising thoughts, no palpating heart to indicate any romantic interest prior to this. Certainly nothing from Sophy, and a brief epiphany moment was alluded to in Charles. Yes, it is s clean book, but as shown by Austen in PaP and Persuasion or Gaskell in NaS, passion and emotions can still be effectively conveyed in nonsexual terms. I also found Charles's sister, Cecily, tiresome and shallow and quite undeserving of her very good and patient eventual love, whom I almost liked more than Charles. If one can overlook a dash of blatant racism, a pinch of incest, a lack of heart, and take it all with a grain of salt, the humour did elevate the story above average. A borrowed line from Persuasion, also got me excited."

I would make it through about 5 or 10 pages before dozing off to dreamland. I really thought I would enjoy this one. It takes place back in regency period. You know...the time when it was ok for cousins to fall in love and marry each other. It kind of had that Jane Austen feel, but Jane Austen has so much more depth and meaning in her stories. This was about a girl named Sophy who goes to live with her aunt and uncle while her father is away on business. Sophy is a Tom boy of sorts, and gets involved in the lives of all her family. Her cousin Charles has no patience for her. Bet you can't see where that is going to go. There was no real plot to this story, the main character Sophy annoyed me...actually I didn't connect with any of the characters. Don't take my word for it though. Most people love this book according to the reviews. Maybe I'm just hard to please. "
75,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3727861-andrea,No Rating,"One of Heyer's absolute best, though sadly marred by a racially stereotypical portrayal of a Jewish moneylender.Sophy herself is endlessly entertaining (though I'm not sure I'd want to come into her orbit in case she decided to organise my life for me), and her relationship with Charles one of the few that comes close to a semblance of equality. I particularly appreciated how people's flaws can be magnified or lessened depending on the company they keep - Charles is simply the worst version of himself in Eugenia's company (though it's worth noting that he is also hiding part of himself around her, since he succeeds in suppressing any outbursts of his notorious temper).Good narrator for audiobook."
76,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"“Aravis also had many quarrels (and, I'm afraid even fights) with Cor, but they always made it up again: so that years later, when they were grown up they were so used to quarreling and making it up again that they got married so as to go on doing it more conveniently.” And that, in short, sums up The Grand Sophy. Of course, it doesn't include the hilarious banter, ridiculous schemes, and quantities of matchmaking that would satisfy Emma Woodhouse, all of which contributed to my five-star rating. But that would be spoiling. You'll just have to read it yourself!"

Most of her novels I enjoy while reading but after a few weeks, months I forget bit by bit. Not ""The Grand Sophy"" (and two or three others).One of the best comedies I have read. A delicious language melody. Marvelous characters. Splendid scenes.What to add, I think if you like the genre you will love this book. Although I don't know how one can like the genre and not know and like ""The Grand Sophy""."

81,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48784575-debbie,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is my tenth Heyer novel (plus one of her short story collections), and her brilliance and creativity continue to amaze me. This is a crazy plot, with a heroine who's like Elizabeth Bennet on steroids (""my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me,"" indeed!) and a hero who's like Fitzwilliam Darcy if he were in charge of a large, irresponsible family.Sophy, of course, is the intrepid heroine. She breezes into the Rivenhall family accompanied by a dog, a parrot, and a monkey, having had a decidedly unconventional upbringing with her father, Sir Horace Stanton-Lacy, a nomadic British ambassador. He's about to sail to Brazil and, as Sophy is now twenty years old, she needs to spend some time in London and find a husband. So she comes to live with Sir Horace's sister, Lady Ombersley, for a few months.It's not Lord Ombersley who rules the family. It's the eldest son Charles Rivenhall, whose unexpected inheritance from his great-uncle saved them from the potentially devastating consequences of Lord Omberley's estate mismanagement. Charles has good reason to hold the reins tightly, and the older members of the family are afraid of him. Not Sophy, of course.She immediately sees that the Rivenhalls are in need of her intervention. Lady Omberley is a dithering woman with no spine, and Lord Omberley is usually absent, off at his club and ignoring his family. Charles is too overbearing and needs to be taken down a peg or two. His brother Hubert is an Oxford student, but Charles doesn't treat him with any respect. His sister Cecilia is nineteen and in the midst of a romantic crisis - in love with Augustus Fawnhope but betrothed to Lord Charlbury. It's a situation that Charles is clearly mishandling (in Sophy's view). His own betrothed, Miss Eugenia Wraxton, is a cold fish who only reinforces Charles's stiff-necked tendencies. Sophy's encouraged that it isn't hopeless when she observes his warmth towards the three youngest children in the household. What ensues is a screwball comedy, with Sophy plotting and remaining at least two steps ahead of everyone else. I love the contrast between Miss Wraxton, who sucks the life out of any room she walks into, and Sophy, who's full of infectious light and liveliness. She's gregarious, capable, and absolutely fearless. Charles is set back on his heels immediately, as is anyone else who tries to interfere in her plans. Absolutely magnificent! It's great fun and the current favorite in my personal Heyer library."
82,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4368838-caz,Rating 5 out of 5,"I sat down to write this review, fingers poised over the keys … and suddenly realized that this would be my first time to write a review of a story that’s older than I am (!) and, moreover, one which is so well known and such a great favourite with romance readers that it frequently tops any “what’s your favourite Regency Romance?” list.It’s been more than twenty years since I last read The Grand Sophy and, while there are a fair few of Georgette Heyer’s books available in audio format, this title wasn’t one of them (unless you count the abridged version also recently issued by Naxos). So I was delighted when I saw that there was an unabridged version coming out. I admit, it’s not my favourite Heyer (that’s Venetia) but it’s still in my top five.Sophy is a young woman who has been brought up by her father, a diplomat, and has lived most of her life abroad. When Sir Horace Stanton-Lacy asks his sister, Lady Ombersley, to take charge of his “little” Sophy while he is on a trip to Brazil, she forms the impression that Sophie is shy, somewhat gauche, and more than a little drab – and agrees to take the girl under her wing and give her the “town bronze” she will need in order to be brought out.But when she arrives, Sophy turns out to be far from little, and far from gauche. In fact, the reality of her could not be farther from the type of retiring girl Lady Ormbersely had been expecting for Sophy is tall, Junoesque of stature, and very much “up to snuff” as the saying is, being poised, confident, witty, and deliciously unconventional.She’s an immediately engaging heroine. Even though she’s unashamedly manipulative, she’s never smug or cruel; actually, she’s rather like a Regency version of Mary Poppins in the way she swoops down upon an unsuspecting and somewhat discontented family and proceeds to put everything right, mending relationships and pulling the strings in a kind of courtship quadrille in which everyone eventually ends up with the right partner.You can read the rest of this review at AudioGals"

She starts the book off as a whirlwind character, causing commotion and generally designing people....er things to her liking and ends the book much the same way. At least Charles grows in his relationship with his younger siblings and Sophy. Sophy on the other hand, is still the scheming and manipulating person that she has always been, from start to finish.And I say that as someone who generally likes Sophy!But what really put me off, and what I am so embarrassed not to have picked up on before, is the strong anti-Semitism in this book. Smart Bitches Trashy Books explains it much more better than me (scroll to the bottom). It was a offensive and horrible written stereotype that led such a bad taste in my mouth I couldn't unread it. I don't think I'll be picking up this book again. Original Review + 5 stars July 2013: Pretty sure this one was my favorite of all the Heyer's I've read so far. It was by far the easiest read and the one with tons of different personality characters that I really enjoyed. Also, no one pairs up multiple couples at the same time in a more satisfactory manner than Heyer. Also, the proposal scene included baby ducklings toddling around. BABY DUCKLINGS!"""

She also loves to sort out other people’s problems. When she realizes everyone at Berkeley Square is attached to the wrong person and into all sorts of trouble, she dives in to fix it. Kind-hearted Aunt Lizzy is shocked but soon becomes a fan of Sophy’s. Stern Cousin Charles and his humorless fiancée Eugenia are disapproving. Sophy continues to plot. An accomplished rider, she soon wins Charles’ admiration even while he takes her to task for her excursions beyond a young lady’s purview.In Sophy, Heyer has created a larger than life heroine who is clever, endearing and witty. One never knows what she will do next. It’s not until 3/4ths of the way through the book that Charles begins to see his cousin Sophy differently so be prepared for the wait. Heyer engages in merciless head hopping and narrator intrusion to tell us the story, which took some getting used to, and she is occasionally short on description. Still, it all works for a delightful Regency romp, very well done. The characters engage in some wild misadventures that Sophy must sort out. In the end all comes right, but to get there you will happily be turning pages!"

Cecilia, she knows doesn't belong with Augustus, a man who thinks he's a poet. But she should marry the man with mumps. Sophy has it all planned out, that is, till Charles stuck his nose in things…His cousin is abominable! Charles cannot wait to marry her off to the first suitor he comes across. Unfortunately, every suitor he finds her with is somehow lacking. But, his betrothed will find some way out of the mess for him, he's sure of it.What can be said that hasn't already been said? Sophy is a riot, her pranks are fabulous and her wit is superb. She is forever up to something that will set her stiff family to rights. If anyone can unbend them it's Sophy… And that's just what she does. This has got to be my Favorite regency by Georgette Heyer, it is so unlike the others! I know a lot of people have difficulties with the Jew represented in one chapter. I don't like when nationalites are stereotype, for instance, displaying British as having crooked teeth, upity ways and saying ""A spot of Tea."" Perfectly ridiculous, but, it doesn't spoil the whole story when it is only one instance. So the thieving Jew didn't spoil it. It wasn't put across as all Jews being like him, it was just him. So in the end I loved it, will reread it, and I know I'll be laughing at Sophy's foolish tricks again one day soon."

It's quite comical at first because the family is waiting to meet a shy, retiring niece and get a full-blown, tall, well-grown woman who knows her own mind. She soon takes the family in hand and solves all their problems, it reminds me of Cold Comfort Farm, but not nearly as good. The worst part and it's a biggie and why I love/hate (love their books, but hate their racism) Heyer and Agatha Christie, there is a whole racist section with a Jewish pawnbroker. Horrible!"

How “grand” could Sophy really be? Bless my heart, I was not prepared. I have adored Arabella and Frederica, but mostly for the redemption and comeuppance of their heroes. I was not prepared for Miss Stanton-Lacy’s literal epicness and basically mind-blowing characterization. Not only is she the OG managing miss, she’s like a hoyden heroine blueprint. The embodiment of so many dazzling adjectives: determined, unaffected, perceptive, confident, lively, effortlessly unconventional, proudly indelicate, practical, bold, scheming, witty, capable *could go on* Reared across the continent accompanying her diplomat father, she blows into the beat-into-submission Rivenhall household as a bit of a practically perfectly shocking Mary Poppins with a pet monkey. And let’s not leave dear Charles out. I have adored Heyer’s frivolous, witty rakes but stick-in-the-mud, duty-burdened, driven to exasperated distraction, Mr. Rivenhall is officially my new favorite. Be forewarned (since I skim blurbs, especially if it’s like “Whoa, so many names”, so I had no idea) in case it gives you irreperable ick: our couple are first cousins. He’s her dad’s sister’s son. You’re good if you can adjust to the societal context here where marrying cousins was totally fine or you can pretend he’s a distant relative ward of the family that inherited a fortune and turned into the functioning patriarch of said mess. The latter proved more effective for me. They’re just SO great together, that missing out because they call each other “cousin”, would be borderline shameful.It’s actually futile to capture in a few lines because the romance progression is so fabulous, but here’s my favorite part of Sophy the Indomitable and Charles the Aggravated: they disarm each other at every turn. He cannot wait to foist her off and pities the fool who marries her, and she could not care less about his bluster. Opposites Attract 101, constantly surprising each other when they discover each other’s true character. Her well-meaning schemes and resulting monumental arguments just absolute fun. Again, the descent of the stoic, proper hero into completely losing it over “the most tiresome girl” wins it all for me.No surprise, Heyer’s cast is remarkable and well-rounded with the “gotta love ‘em”absurd. The third act climaxes going off the rails with such a prodigious tangled web bonkers scenario very worthy of our grand Sophy. Why oh why do these stories end with eleventh-hour resolutions and then no epilogue? And yet, when it’s been so masterfully woven, the HEA is so certain we can end it at an violently exasperated kiss and know the Rivenhalls will carry on well indeed…as long as Sophy stays away from his horses.Cannot fail to mention that, if Austen’s Emma is your idea of a swoony good time: whatreyoudoin, you simply must read this. Dare I say, Sophia Stanton-Lacy has surpassed Emma Woodhouse for me as this story takes the well-meaning fixer mentality heroine to charming chaotic heights.Once again with these new editions, I appreciated Ms. James’s foreword as I join the ranks of generations of Sophy-fans. And particularly the note on “literary repairs” as prejudicial aspects were removed from a previously problematic scene found in the original.Thank you to Netgalley and the publisher for an ARC.Content notes: brief mention of kissing only, Some time period cursing and frequent use of the Lord’s name in vain. Hero threatens with bodily harm in infuriated jest."

It's a fun rump with an outrageous heroine, a gaggle of secondary characters, a sweet greyhound, and some horses, too. The whirlwind that is Sophy is so entertaining.There's been a lot of attention on the revising of old work lately. The practice has been happening for centuries, but people outside of literary circles have suddenly become aware of it and have decided to enter the debate. In the case of The Grand Sophy, Eloisa James' afterward explains that the scene with a moneylender in the original has anti-Semitic language. Removing that content doesn't change the impact of this story.This isn't just the case of reissuing a title that sells well year after year. This is a timely and warranted revision."

91,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38966006-mary-pagones,Rating 5 out of 5,"I'd struggled with Heyer two times before, but if you can get through the first two chapters of exposition, the book is delightful. It's no secret that I love to read (and write) horse books, and the equestrian talent of the heroine is one of the book's main appeals. Even if you ride, you'll probably have to go scurrying to Wikipedia to learn more about the different types of carriages popular during the Regency, and what sorts of vehicles were considered appropriate or inappropriate for a woman to drive.There is a great deal of screwball fun in this book, and not much suspense or even romance about how the various couplings will end up. But since I'm not a fan of romance as a genre, this was a great plus for me. The book is more of a set piece for the title character to show her prowess at riding, training animals, shooting, and matchmaking. For that final talent, Sophy is often compared to Jane Austen's Emma, probably because Heyer herself is compared with Austen (and invited the comparison herself).But in other ways, The Grand Sophy is almost an anti-Emma. While Emma is unerring wrong, all of the time, and Mr. Knightley is always right, it is Sophy who is inevitably correct in her manipulations and reading of human nature, while all of the various characters around her inevitably fall short. I find this an incredible relief, personally, since although Jane Austen will always have my heart, she sometimes frustrates me how much she insists her heroines be schooled by men, rather than school men (particularly in Emma).Heyer is still no Austen. As funny and witty as some of the dialogue may be, there are far too many two-dimensional characters for her book to transcend the confines of genre fiction. By the end of the book, I was longing for some of Austen's subtle character analysis. Still, I'm now willing to try more of Heyer's regencies. Austen and Shakespeare, in my mind, stand alone in their ability to analyze the psychologies of people of vastly different character types.Since it's come up so many times in reviews, it's necessary to address one scene *spoiler alert* involving a moneylender. Unsurprisingly, the younger, profligate son of the family where Sophy is residing gets into some money trouble. Sophy handles the matter admirably, but the moneylender is characterized by virtually every antisemitic stereotype possible, from his name to his greasy hair, to the filth of his establishment. He leers at the Christian woman, is utterly heartless, and even threatens to kidnap her. In this otherwise lighthearted book, the moneylender is actively dehumanized and called a ""creature."" Fortunately, this is only confined to a single scene, but the fact that Heyer felt such a portrayal was acceptable when the book was published in 1950--when the memory of the Holocaust was still fresh--is a sobering reminder of the deep and entrenched nature of antisemitism in so much of popular literature. Genre novels like romances, mysteries, and adventure tales abound in stereotypes of ""the other,"" whether that ""other"" be Jewish, Middle Eastern, African, Indian, or even Southern European. These types of portrayals do have an effect on our collective unconscious, I believe, and need to be highlighted when they occur. Never let anyone tell you that we've gotten to some historical watershed where it's not necessary to be vigilant about antisemitic stereotypes. A respected author still thought this type of portrayal was okay to casually drop in a book only a few years after the end of World War II. "

You set the town talking with your shameless conduct in keeping Charlbury dangling after you, and not content with that, you allow a fellow like Talgarth to behave to you as though you had been an inn servant!”She opened her eyes at him. “Charles! Is that what you do? Pinch their chins? Well, I was never more astonished! I don’t think you should!”and“Sophy looked at him. Under his amazed and horrified gaze, large tears slowly welled over her eyelids and rolled down her cheeks. She did not sniff, or gulp, or even sob; merely she allowed her tears to gather and fall.“Sophy!” ejaculated Mr. Rivenhall, visibly shaken. He took an involuntary step toward her, checked himself, and said rather disjointedly, “Pray do not! I did not mean—I had no intention— You know how it is with me! I say more than I mean, when—Sophy, for God’s sake do not cry!”“Oh, do not stop me!” begged Sophy. “Sir Horace says it is my only accomplishment!”Mr. Rivenhall glared at her. “What?”“Very few persons are able to do it,” Sophy assured him. “I discovered it by the veriest accident when I was only ten years old. Sir Horace said I should cultivate it, for I should find it most useful.”As with all Heyer’s books, it’s beautifully written, but I didn’t feel the same connection with the characters that I did in These Old Shades, Cotillion and Venetia."

Her personality is such a know-it-all, Miss Perfect, and even when she makes a “mistake”, it all just works out peachy keen, cause everyone just loves loves loves the fabulous Miss Sophy. Ugh. Gag and vomit. LolBesides my hatred of Sophy (if hate is too strong, maybe it’s intense dislike), this book just doesn’t hold up into the 21st century. The subtle (or maybe not, as it’s definitely there) anti-semitism is another mark against this one.Even with the loss of a star for that prejudice (as mentioned above), I never even liked this book when I originally read it back in the 1980s (again, Sophy 🙄). All that being said, I would say that this is one of my least favorite Heyer’s, and I would have to rank it somewhere on the bottom of my GH List. While I have read this one at least a dozen times, the last time I read it was about two years ago - around the time that the anti-Semitism in this book was brought to light. Given this unfortunate fact, I really have no desire to read this one again anytime soon. Which is saying something as GH books are my comfort reads and I reread them near neurotically.Maybe I’ll choose to read this at some point in the 2030s, but maybe not. Three solid stars due to Heyer’s impeccable writing skill."
96,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26734926-emma,Rating 5 out of 5,"In this regency era historical romance novel, a young lady moves in with her aunt and cousins while her father travels abroad. Rather than being the shy and retiring girl they are expecting, Sophy is a rather bold, clever and altogether modern women. She will happily ride horses and shoot pistols and generally talk back in a way that is probably highly unrealistic for anyone in that era. She meddles in her cousins lives in an attempt to improve them, and is altogether a very witty character. I enjoyed the central romance, especially when you view it in the context of what would have been acceptable in those days. I thought the characters had great chemistry and enjoyed their interactions.The book is likely not at all realistic in its portrayal of Sophy, but really who cares. She constantly pushes the bounds of how a young woman should act in those days.I rated this 5 stars as it is one of my favourite books this year but there were some parts I didn't enjoy. I felt the last quarter of the book, where Sophy started matchmaking in earnest was a bit convoluted and also I felt her meddling was going a bit far at that stage as she essentially toyed with a lot of people's emotions. Still, overall this was a lot of fun, and this is coming from someone who never reads romance."
97,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2680530-maygirl7,Rating 4 out of 5,"This was a great audiobook ""read"". I really enjoyed the banter and Sophy's determination to fix everyone. I appreciated that while she was willing to think outside social constraints that she was realistic about what she could and could not do without going too far, e.g.,  setting up a chaperone in advance of her fake elopement with Chalbury (sp?)  and that Charles can see her for who she really is. It's also nice that Charles' character is not completely transformed because *love* happens to him. Both he and Sophy are the same people they were at the beginning of the book though with more nuances and understanding of all sides of their characters. Heyer definitely owes a lot to Emma in creating Sophy's character. PLUS There were definitely laugh out loud moments. The story did lose points when  Sophy shot Chalbury.  That was too OTT for me. Definitely eager to read more Heyer. "

Pero sir Horace la convence prometiéndole que su hija no le dará mucho trabajo pues es una niñita que no le dará problemas ya que es una muchacha sensata que sabe cuidar de sí misma.Sophia será un torbellino que llega para revolucionar la vida de la familia Rivenhall. Al llegar conocerá a sus primos y se irá dando cuenta de los problemas que aquejan a cada uno de los miembros de la familia, y aunque su ayuda no haya sido solicitada, se propone ayudarlos a cada uno de ellos a salir en la situación en la que se encuentran, empezando por evitar el inminente matrimonio de su primo Charles y ayudar a su prima Celeste pues no le permiten casarse con el hombre del que está enamorada.«Sin embargo, como no era de esas personas que abandonan un proyecto una vez que han decidido emprenderlo, ni por un momento se le ocurrió dejar que su joven primo solucionará por sí mismo sus problemas.» «Pero Sophia no soportaba ver a alguien acosado por la preocupación sin sentir de inmediato la necesidad de descubrir la causa de sus tribulaciones y, a ser posible, rectificarla.»Sophia hace honor al título de esta novela pues es verdaderamente indomable, un tornado de la naturaleza. A sus veinte años es una muchacha muy independiente, leal, dispuesta y decidida, a la que importan muy poco los convencionalismos sociales, llama la atención por su altura aunque físicamente se la considera lejos de los cánones de belleza de la época, pero tiene una personalidad chispeante y vivaracha que atrae a todo el mundo.«[...] Dígame, ya que es usted tan franca, ¿siempre trata de emparejar a la gente, allá donde va?—No —contesto ella—, a menos que esté convencida de que eso es lo mejor para ellos.» Sir Horace es diplomático por lo que ha viajado por el mundo llevando a su hija con él. Al morir su esposa cuando su hija era muy niña, Sophia se ha criado sola con su padre que le ha dado una educación muy liberal para una señorita de su posición, haciendo de Sophie una muchacha absolutamente extrovertida, independiente, con un carácter fuerte y profundas convicciones. «—¿Sabe —dijo el con seriedad— que es usted la mujer más asombrosa que jamás se tiene la fortuna de conocer? Observará que no específico si es buena o mala fortuna, porque todavía no sé cuál de cuál de las dos se trata.»Me ha sorprendido un poco sir Horace, el padre de Sophie, no sé si es un padre desapegado o tan confiado y consciente de lo resuelta que es su hija que no considera necesario preocuparse por ella. Su primo Charles es el primogénito de la familia, un hombre recto y dominante con toda la responsabilidad de los suyos sobre sus hombros y que se debate entre la admiración que le provoca la indomable muchacha y la desaprobación que le producen a veces su actos y comportamiento alocado.«[...] Prima, mi tío Horace nos dijo que eras una niñita muy buena y que no causarías ningún problema. No llevas ni medio día con nosotros; tiemblo de pensar en el lío que puedes haber organizado cuando haya pasado una semana.» La relación de Charles con sus familia es complicada, pues lo temen y lo consideran un tirano que solo quiere imponer sus deseos a todos sin tener en cuenta sus deseos y sentimientos. Con Sophia tampoco le irá mucho mejor, ya que la muchacha hace caso omiso a sus consejos y lo saca de quicio en cada momento con su extravagante comportamiento. Pero su prima le hará replantearse muchas de las cosas que creía ciertas y ver con otros ojos a los miembros de su familia.Hay una gran multitud de personajes secundarios, aunque los que más relevancia tienen son la familia de Sophia.Se trata de un libro con solera ya que la primera publicación de esta historia fue allá por el 1950, aun así es una de esas historias que se disfrutan pues refleja la vida y costumbres de la época que se nos narra.El libro tiene cuatrocientas sesenta y dos páginas divididas en dieciocho capítulos y la narración es en tercera persona. Tenemos una historia de lectura fluida, ya que en la trama no dejan de pasar cosas lo que hace que tenga un ritmo trepidante y adictivo. Una historia carente de romance, al menos hasta las últimas páginas y lo poco que vemos de este queda muy en segundo plano pero con toques de humor y diálogos ingeniosos que hacen de ella una historia chispeante y divertida que me ha enganchado desde la primera página. Es una comedia de enredos, no sé si habréis visto la película Oscar ¡quita las manos! (1991) pero salvando las distancias, me la ha recordado mucho, no dejan de pasar situaciones divertidas y disparatadas y Sophia, que suele ser la instigadora y encontrarse en medio de todo tiene que ir lidiando y moviendo las piezas para que cada cosa encaje con sus intereses y pretensiones, ocasionando situaciones bastante divertidas. He disfrutado mucho más de lo que me esperaba, pero la resolución me ha parecido demasiado previsible y algo precipitada. Me ha fallado un poco el final bastante abrupto, me ha faltado un epílogo, pues te deja la sensación de que le falta algún que otro capítulo y me hubiera gustado saber que pasará después con todos los personajes.Es una historia divertida, bien escrita que consigue atraparte desde el principio... lo mejor, la lucha de voluntades entre Sophy y Charles por supuesto. Un clásico que no decepciona y te deja con muy buen sabor de boca. Muy entretenido.Reseña en: https://bibliotecariarecomienda.blogs..."

102,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2073558-meredith-austenesque-reviews,Rating 5 out of 5,"Sophy is a Marvel!TYPE OF NOVEL: Historical Fiction, Regency RomanceSETTING: 1816 London, EnglandWHY I WANTED TO READ THIS NOVEL:I’ve seen this particular Heyer novel listed as the top favorite of many Georgette Heyer fans (more so than any other book I think!)SYNOPSIS:Because her father is called away to Brazil, Sophy Stanton-Lacy is sent to stay with relations in London. When Sophy arrives she can easily discern that the Rivenhalls are in one too many fixes and it is up to her to set it all to rights! Even though her father declared that Sophy “won’t cause you any trouble,” “has her head well on her shoulders,” and is never a cause for worry, Sophy’s rigid and dictatorial cousin, Charles, finds Sophy everything that is exasperating, infuriating, and disruptive of one’s peace.WHAT I LOVED:- Sophy: Oh my! Sophy is quite unlike any heroine I’ve met before! She is supremely confident, shockingly unconventional, and wonderfully astute. In some ways she is half Mary Poppins and half Lucy Ricardo! Sophy arrives at home in much need of her special attention and assistance, and she is an amazing schemer who solves everyone’s dilemmas with the most harebrained and nonsensical ways! She is a character you cannot help but fall in love with and admire! A true whirling dervish!- Miss Eugenia Wraxton: Charles Rivenhall’s fiancée is the complete opposite of Sophy! She is serious, extremely devoted to the strictures of propriety, and bit cold and unfeeling. I thoroughly enjoyed despising her! I would even say she is a character more hateful and odious than Caroline Bingley! I really like how Eugenia’s character was developed, she grew to be more conniving and sanctimonious as the story progressed! She became more vocal with her superior opinions, often gave unsolicited remonstrations, and even had the audacity to read private correspondences! She was utterly contemptible!- Such Well-Drawn Characters and Invigorating Plots: I cannot help but be impressed by the brilliant array of dynamic characters – from the ridiculous to the sublime! I enjoyed my time with them all! Georgette Heyer has a talent for showing the most personality with the slightest bit of page time! And I’m sure I’m not the only one who finds Georgette Heyer’s plots to be masterful! The surprising twists, timely arrivals, and the perfect dose of comedy – these novels are wonderfully constructed and extremely entertaining!- What A Conclusion!: I love a good resolution, and this madcap adventure ended with in a real bang-up style! I especially enjoyed how the conclusion was drawn out and not too fast-paced. While Sophy is trying to pull off her grandest scheme of all, everything goes wrong. She constructed a multi-step plan and set it all in motion with precision, but so much that was unexpected happened! It was hilarious to see such a scene of pandemonium manifest itself upon the indomitable Sophy and watch her disentangle it all.WHAT I WASN’T TOO FOND OF:I could say something about wanting a little more romance or page time for the hero, but I really have not much cause to complain!CONCLUSION:Sophy is indeed grand, and most definitely a character with whom every Georgette Heyer fan should become acquainted! I’m so very glad I finally met Sophy and I must say I thoroughly enjoyed the encounter! I am happy to add my recommendation and praise to such a beloved novel by Georgette Heyer!"

104,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/767841-melani,Rating 1 out of 5,"People have been telling me that I need to read Georgette Heyer's books for a long time now. I just never really got around to it, I'd make a mental note and then just never pick up one of her books. So I'm finally giving her books a go. I have issues, a lot of issues. I don't know if those issues are singular to The Grand Sophy, but I'm not really willing to read another one of her books to find out. To put it plainly, this book contains one of the most egregious scenes of antisemitism that I have ever come across in fiction. That one scene retroactively ruined what had been a fairly charming read up to that point.The plot is pretty simple. Shortly after the Napoleonic wars Sophy goes to live with her aunt, uncle, and cousins while she sets about husband seeking and her father is off doing ambassadorial stuff in Brazil. Sophy finds the family in a bit of a mess. Her eldest cousin is engaged to a mean spirited woman that he doesn't love. He is also the defacto head of family due to the father's gambling debts and he's become a bit of a tyrant. The cousin closest in age to Sophy is currently in love with a completely unsuitable match. So Sophy gets to work setting these things aright with some vigor. For the first half of the novel I was completely enraptured. The book was witty and fun, and while it was pretty clear how it would all shake out, that doesn't mean getting there was going to be a slog.However at the halfway point Sophy has to rescue one of her cousins from his folly. He borrowed money from a moneylender and for reasonable reasons Sophy goes to pay that off. Now, when I tell you that this scene could have come straight out of the SS propaganda I don't want you to think I'm exaggerating. It's gross, it's beyond gross. Sophy, who had previously been witty and independent came across cruel, rude, and a bit stuck-up. To be clear, the book did not want us to see the scene that way. We're supposed to find Sophy brave and exceptional for facing down the evil, dirty, money grubbing Jew who held a wicked claim over her cousin. However, as a modern reader, I can't read it any other way. I finished the book, but it had completely lost it's charm with that one scene.I'm giving the book two stars because I do think Heyer wrote wonderfully, and her characters are full of wit and charm. Honestly, I'm a little angry that this is never mentioned when people bring up Heyer and her books. The only thing I've ever heard about her is that she's wonderful, her romances are fantastic, and every lover of Jane Austen should read her.  Well, this is me telling you, don't read this book, it's charm and wit are completely ruined by antisemitism."

Но не и в нашата страна, което е доста странно, имайки предвид , че всяка съвременна романтична писателка задължително я поставя в списъка на вдъхновилите я автори, четена и препрочитана през кратките лета на някой таван, смеейки се на вербалните дуели, и примирайки в романтичните моменти. Това да разлистваш стотици страници елегантна ирония, сложни интриги и благовъзпитани романтични моменти между твърдоглави девици и себични юнаци си е удоволствие за ваканция, за времена на почивка и спокойствие, каквито вероятно вече е невъзможно да бъдат изпитани.Да, Хейър е автор за млади романтични души с повече интелект и повече чувствителност, отколкото се предполага в днешно време да е нормално да се притежава от подрастващото поколение. Изисква се определено състояние на духа, което може би е твърде винтидж, а и доста непрактично, изискващо дълги, веещи се на вятъра рокли, много свободни ч��сове за бродене из пухкави облаци и, естествено, промишлени количества чай и кифлички, че то романтиката на празен стомах не вирее. А такъв сетинг, признавам, е ако не съвсем невъзможен, то много трудно постижим за масите, дори и при най-добро желание.Гранд-дамите на Хейър – Софи, Арабела и Федерика са прекрасни образи за следване, малко нагли, доста самоуверени, напълно целеустремени и непозволяващи на мачизмът и сексизмът да им отнемат бриза от платната, съвсем като орда Елизабети Бенети, но с по-малко очаквания към света. Хероичните мъжественици н�� Хейър пък са до един вариации на Дарси – горди, самодостатъчни, егоисти и общо взето стегнати дупета, но пък си намират майстора до един, след много пререкания, комедии на недоразуменията и нравите, и така да се каже доста интелектуално и романтично задоволително ухажване, явно достойно да бъде оставено на поколенията под формата на книга. Да, Хейър може би не е за всеки в днешно време, но за всеки, който я припознае като своя любим автор, ще е като книжният вариант на топъл чай за душата в мрачна зимна сутрин. Аххх…"
106,no user info,Rating 3 out of 5,"First-rate Heyer. Here's a family: mother kind of helpless the way a lot of Heyer mothers are; father a weak-willed gambler; oldest son Charles arrogant as you get when everybody else in your family is an idiot (and he's engaged to the most awful busybody right out of Austen); oldest daughter Cecilia rejecting an arranged marriage to quite a nice man in order to fall in love with an extremely handsome and absent-minded poet. And in comes their cousin, Sophia, who's been raised by a traveling military father; she's utterly courageous and self-sufficient and has no clue about convention, and she fixes everything. Sophy is wonderful -- when Charles gives her a lecture that begins, ""If you wish to please me ..."" she replies, ""But I *don't* wish to please you."" She's utterly unpretentious, but not really lacking in respect for proprieties: When someone explains a rule to her, she makes a reasonable judgment about whether to obey it or not, based on the likely effects on others. And she's quite brave, but she doesn't do anything, really, that anyone couldn't do -- I mean, the risks she takes aren't really that great, except that she doesn't care what people say about her. And she's very clever about people.I loved the poet, Augustus -- he's delightfully focused on poetry and nothing else. When Cecilia breaks off their engagement, he says vaguely, ""Yes, I was not made for marriage, but you must, must allow me to dedicate my tragedy to you. Now, for this poem, what do you think of the title, 'To Sophia, Lifting a Lamp'?""Charles, the hero, didn't seem quite worthy of her, really; he wasn't as stiff-necked and obnoxious as he first appeared, but there was nothing special about him, either. Period prejudices made me nervous -- the incredibly lazy Spanish noblewoman (""very indolent, as all Spaniards are"") and the evil Jewish moneylender."

Coming off in a fashion more like comical historical fiction than a romance, The Grand Sophy provides loads of entertainment though it is quite shy in the romance department. Perhaps what I loved the most was the unconventional and yet somehow well-intentioned and equally accomplished family problem solver, Sophy. Reminding me somewhat of a grown-up version of one of my favorite childhood heroines, Pippi Longstockings, no problem was too big (or for that matter too small) for Sophie to come up with some fantastic and attention grabbing plot for which to resolve the issue with. Equally alluring is the accomplished narration by Sarah Woodward who does a great job of bringing this lively cast to life. But be forewarned, Sophie's antics in resolving familial dramas is the primary focus of this tale and the HEA is quite rushed (never mind somewhat unbelievable and perhaps not even legal?) and quickly tied together at the end. So only undertake this journey if you are looking for a historical comedy and are fine with listening to a book without a romance angle. Source: Library loan. Sent from my iPhone"

It was really very humorous and I had quite a few laughs. Unfortunately, the story was too long and Sophy became ridiculous in the end with the complexity and audacity of her Machinations. That really put me off.  when she SHOT one of the men she was matchmaking for in order to make his sweetheart feel sorry for him, I just about stopped right there. Way over the top and completely unbelievable.  The narrator, Sarah Woodward, did a pretty good job with the variety of characters.

Why I didn't pass on this one is a mystery for the ages, and one that I don't care about solving because here we are, a four-star review in progress.There have been comparisons of Georgette Heyer's work to Jane Austen's, and even more arguments against those comparisons. In my mind it's at least a halfway legitimate comparison because it occurred to me even before I'd read a single review. ""This feels like Jane Austen!"" I thought. ""But easier!""Sophy is a character that could be easy to dislike - so ahead of her time in a way that makes others look foolish simply for being typical of their era, easy-breezy friendly with much of the aristocracy, entirely likable with nary a fault, manipulative of those around her because she knows what is best for them (and of course she is right). She is bold and vibrant and never in a bad mood. Dear God I am tired of characters like that, and yet here we are, four-star review in progress.It's just that it was so fun and pleasant and easy to read, and it's so interesting to me that this was written 100 years ago, about an era that happened 100 years before that. So that makes it like double historical fiction. Or historical fiction squared. In any case I totally enjoyed it, am moving on to another Georgette Heyer today, and there it is, four-star review done."

 “What do you mean to do when you reach Lacy Manor?” asked Sir Horace, regarding him in some amusement.“Wring Sophy’s neck!” said Mr. Rivenhall savagely.“Well, you don’t need my help for that, my dear boy!” said Sir Horace, settling himself more comfortably in his chair.

When Sophy arrives in Berkley Square to stay with her aunt’s family, she is not at all what anyone expected — and may prove to be more than any of her relatives, especially her cousin Charles, can handle.With her pet monkey and a horse which is the admiration of the neighbourhood, Sophy is an exotic addition to the household, and everyone who meets her stands a little in awe of her. Extensive travelling experience, an adventurous spirit and her wild ways endear her to most of them, but leave the remainder antagonised.When Sophy discovers what hopeless situations her three cousins have entangled themselves in, she sallies forth to rescue each of them from certain doom – Cecilia’s forbidden love, Charles’ unfortunate engagement and Hubert’s outstanding debts.But as her hilarious and maddening schemes create deeper confusion and a few problems of her own, it may be that Sophy has involved herself in one plot too many. Can she ever create a happy ending for each of her cousins — let alone one for herself?Of the three  Georgette Heyer novels I have recently read,  The Grand Sophy has proved by far the most engaging and entertaining. And for once I felt that the good points outweighed the bad points. > Sophy's character is unexpected and she creates some rollicking fun. She's always outwitting and out-outmanoeuvring the people she comes in contact with. Half of the time it's impossible to guess what she's up to, making for an exciting story. I like the way she constantly provokes Charles so he can see what he's becoming, and at the same time draws out his good side.> For the first time, one of Heyer’s main characters changes. Charles is flawed, but he learns from his mistakes. He starts to appreciate his siblings more. Unlike Heyer’s other heroes, Charles isn’t a dandy, a lord or a sir; he isn’t irresistibly good-looking or irritatingly arrogant. Here is a man who cares deeply for his family and is willing to sacrifice his own interests for theirs, who defends his cousin’s reputation and at the same time urges her to improve; who can be serious and hilarious, and who sees straight through most of Sophy’s hijinks. A convincing and compelling lead.> Miss Wraxton is a slightly more complex antagonist than usual. At first I could sympathise with her. I understood her irritation and could forgive her jealousy when Sophy turned up on the scene. But as the story progresses her true colours show. Heyer brings out the point that sometimes two people can deceive each other when they are in love; they try to be something they’re not to please the other person, but they only end up disappointed. Better to be yourself and be seen for who you really are. That way at least any potential lovers know what they’re getting into!On a side note, it seemed ironic that Miss Wraxton and Sophy were both attempting the same thing — fixing the Rivenhalls' problems — but each was going about it in a different way. I was left wondering if either went about it in the right way? A subtle and interesting study of motives and the fine line between a bad guy and a good guy.> Overall, it’s a quick, light read with plenty of funny moments. A whirlwind of events and witticisms and comedic characters. Suspenseful because it’s a tightly knotted plot which threatens to unravel at any point. Something about  The Grand Sophy seemed more real, more plausible, more “ordinary” than Heyer’s other books.As for the faults of this book, I’ll try not to repeat what I’ve already mentioned in previous reviews about Heyer’s style. My main objections:> Sophy interferes in everyone else’s lives and sees it as her responsibility to fix their problems, most of the time against their will. She constantly manipulates people and situations to suit her or to suit what she perceives as the best outcome. This is all very well while it’s the right thing to do but as soon as it’s not, it’s downright wrong. I don’t see manipulation as a virtue. And it's potentially destructive in a marriage if the husband can't recognise and deal with it.> Her schemes always work. I understand the book is supposed to be lighthearted, a bit of a comedy, but it’s irritating that everything Sophy puts her hand to is a success, and if it isn’t it’s only because someone else came along and interfered. There’s only so much control/influence one person can have on the circumstances they find themselves in and the people they encounter. Even if Sophy was the most talented con artist in existence, she couldn’t simultaneously manipulate everyone and everything to do exactly what she planned/predicted/wanted. Something would eventually go wrong. This story would’ve been much funnier and more convincing if Sophy had been forced to deal with unexpected predicaments and impassable obstacles. Which leads me on to my last irk (yes, I just treated that verb like a noun):> Sophy doesn’t change. She’s always right. How can a character who is always right possibly improve? And how can such a character exist in reality or reflect reality in any way? You got it. She can’t. So ultimately Sophy is just a paper puppet of the author's fantasy to be in control and admired by everyone.Apart from these grievances, I enjoyed this book to the last outrageous page. Thanks to the friend who lent me these books. It's been fun.Thus ends my short Georgette Heyer spurt. For anyone interested in Heyer’s work, I would only recommend  The Grand Sophy. Glad I could finish on a positive note!"

The visiting niece to a large aristocratic family comes to stay for the duration while her Father finishes some business in Brazil- she shakes it all up. Not just the estate, nearly everything and everyone in it. That's the gist. This Regency Georgette Heyer is just delightful. A comedy of manners read absolutely, and yet far deeper in motivations and consequences. This is rather like a ""My Fair Lady"" in reverse, but rather than the change and modification coming from differing economic class, Sophy mentors emotional change that is nearly the opposite TO what is accepted as normal in the society of her period. Altering by her high jinx family member connection and activity, Sophy is the hoyden with brilliant ideas and flamboyant energy who does not do the expected. Ever. She drives horses independently, she shoots, she is LARGE and that's just the obvious. This is not an easy read. I used my Kindle dictionary repeatedly. And I thought I knew every name for carriage style or type, despite the number of horses in the pulling! Not by the size and shape of a berlin was I particularly close. The entire section when she was carriage shopping with ""advice"" was a hoot. French words, archaic words and flowing sentences of poetry from one character in ever increasing density. Also the stilted language of Regency high society with paragraph length sentences. Regardless, Sophy was a recipe for beguiling and limitless perfection toward her preferred modifications.This is the best Georgette Heyer I have read. That she could articulate this woman as she did in 1950, is nothing short of amazing. Frequently while reading, Shakespeare came to my mind. These quirks and turns and hints of tease are, IMHO, much like his plays. Always keeping you aware of the crux nature of the speaker, the seed in the tooth, the disharmony or guilt behind the character's façade. And always the manipulators of obligation or guilt laden purpose in the forefront as protagonists.In reading other reviews on this one, I'm fairly sure that they did not understand the ending. ""Going to the stables"" does not have the same connotation as they assume in 2014 at all. It was for fast exit to return to his home in triumph. She can wait as she has the planned result. This does not have the same context as the present hook-up culture.  "

It is definitely one of my favorite regency romances, and just a favorite in general. Sophy is such a brilliant character. Truly. Brilliant. And so different from the norm in these kinds of books. She is tall and not very lady-like. She is snarky and witty. Sweet and mischievous. And Charles? Well, he isn't perfect, nor perfectly flawed(like Sophy) but he is a lovely match for Sophy and darn it all if I wasn't shipping them near immediately. Usually in these, it takes me almost the entire book to have resigned myself to the couple. I found myself, about half way through, wishing that it might never end. It's a long book and frequently, with other books, you'll find me wiping away tears of boredom, but not so here! Sophy's shenanigans, the reprimands she got, and the witty remarks she shot back were such fun to read.I wish I had taken notes to write down something that would give you an idea of why exactly this one is Heyer's best, in my opinion, but I didn't and now here we are, with me begging you to just read it, because, if you're anything like me, you'll love it too.Hey, BBC!!! *waves The Grand Sophy frantically* Mightn't you make this into a mini-series??

For a while there it seemed that I would be reading Heyer because of the humor and not for the romance, but I'm glad to report this book has alleviated those fears. Apparently all I needed was a busybody heroine who has been left with her aunt's family while her father is in Brazil. The household ruled by cousin Charles is not a happy one, but with Sophy, it's only a matter of time, ingenuity and determination for things to change.Even I will admit that The Grand Sophy is competency porn, given that our heroine is never wrong and only occasionally stumbles. But it's never boring, the plot so well executed and the pacing is even better. And we finally have a couple that can argue and banter with the best of them, but by the end of the book, the hero understands and trusts the heroine. This was a book I thoroughly enjoyed from start to finish. To be honest, I listened to this abridged audiobook because I was trying to avoid certain anti-semtic passages. I managed to do that even if I couldn't avoid ungenerous generalization of the Spanish.Still, I was giddy with happiness by the time this book was over. Passion seems not to rank high on Heyer's list for a good romantic pairing, instead choosing to focus on mutual respect, understanding and a similar sense of humor. Such a sweet treasure of a book! "

I thought Sarah Woodward did a phenomenal job of “performing” the book instead of just reading; she was one of those narrators that seemed to really “get” and enjoy the story she was narrating. She has a great voice for all the different characters in a Heyer book (she does a good job with both male and female voices) and I hope that she’ll record more in the future!(considered a traditional “clean” secular regency – God’s name was used in vain fairly often as an exclamation; an occasional expletive such as “damme” or “hell”)"

I'll call it 4.75 stars, but I'll round up to 5.One of my favorites, re-read many times.ETA: 8/3/2018 Just finished my gazillionth re-read and loved almost every minute of it. Sophy is one of my top 5 Heyer heroines. She is confident, warm-hearted, with a lively sense of humor and an understanding of human behavior way beyond her years. Watching her in action, as she 'fixes' the various problems of her Rivenhall cousins, makes for a delightful time for the reader."

The supposed romance promised by the blurb played a distant second to Sophy's plotline, a narrative where she's devoted to fixing the lives of her newly-acquainted relatives. Consequentially Sophy and Charles barely spent any time together, nor did the author delve into their romantic feelings for each other. I think Heyer finally remembered she had a romance to attend to and slapped a kiss on at the end, just before the abrupt ending."

The book is charming and funny in so many ways; but there is an awful scene involving a Jewish money-lender that made my skin crawl and my jaw clench with its casually malicious skewering of Jewish people. (This cretinous man is the only Jewish person in the book, and the only other mention of them is also a slur.) Even without that, this chapter was the weakest in the book, so outlandish was it. The rest of it I pretty much adored, so I'm going to pretend that whole chapter does not exist and move on with my life."

The novel reminded me of one of those Regency-era movies with a more comedic side: not that realistic but so very satisfying. It did take me a while to differentiate and get to know the characters, and since the cast of characters is indeed quite big, their introduction could have been more gradual and purposeful, in order to bring more clarity and flesh out each character as you get to know them."

Sophy is very much like Austen’s Emma- she is an impetuous, scheming little match maker. The narrator did a splendid job of bringing her & her schemes to life. After reading a couple of her novels, I’m more used to Heyer’s writing & its lack of full on romance. The ending is quite abrupt & romance seemingly out of nowhere but the book was so cute I’ll give it a pass. This book was the perfect length with an amazing narrator. 💕"

149,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5063928-sophia,Rating 5 out of 5,"Tempestuous, irrepressible, and quirkily dazzling, Sophy has a charm that has made her one of Georgette Heyer's most memorable heroines. The Grand Sophy was one of the first Heyer novels I came across years ago and I was thrilled to come back to it in audio format.Clare Wille is a new to me narrator, but she brought the story vividly to life and I plunged into her voice work with as much pleasure as the story itself. And, just to be clear this Naxos edition is ABRIDGED and only a little over four hours in length compared to the other Naxos audio edition that is eleven hours.The Grand Sophy is a Regency romp that takes place after the Napoleonic War. Sir Horace is a successful diplomat who worked on the Continent through much of the war and the peace after, but now must do His Majesty's business in South America. Up until now, this unorthodox man has had his daughter by his side. This time, he will not. He will leave his 'little Sophy' with his sister's family in London to introduce her to English society and find her a husband.Her relations are willing, but then they meet Sophy. Sophy can see rather swiftly that her aunt, her cousins, and the whole household are in dire need of her brand of help. Her oldest cousin has attached himself to a starched up dreary woman who makes everyone miserable, his sister fancies herself in love with an Adonis-like poet, and another cousin is hiding a secret burden. Oh yes, they need doing and she settles in to turn their lives upside down. Exotic pets, dashing horses and carriage, fashionable, well-connected, and something of an original, Miss Sophia Stanton-Lacey takes London by storm and not even her intelligent, sharp and dominating cousin Charles can out jockey her.What a winning gem of a Regency romp that isn't to be missed."
150,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1401537-kaye,Rating 3 out of 5,When I requested this novel I didn’t realize the author is famous for being an early British romance novelist. This story was first published in 1950 and the author passed away in 1974. Her books are seemingly being published again and I received an ARC via NetGalley and Sourcebooks Casablanca. When her father (Sir Horace) needs to go to South America he asks his sister to watch over Sophy. Sophy is a grand character. She grew up with her military father and she is excellent at managing people around her. She isn’t a naive miss but instead befriends everyone without breaking any society rules. It is flummoxing to cousin Charles her love interest who likes his orderly house as it was.The plot is fun but I think the older writing style is an obstacle for me. And Charles wasn’t in my mind much of a catch. But the author wrote in different times and is an acknowledged expert on the Regency era. Just three stars from me but I can see others enjoying it more.

Upon arrival Sophy clashes with her elder cousin, Charles Rivenhall, who has been managing the household for his parents for some years and is used to everyone obeying his decrees. Sophy would be the last person to believe she’d fall in love with her new rival. _________Since there are numerous characters in this book, I would advise looking up a summary before you begin reading. Besides Sophy, her father, aunt, and uncle, she has three older cousins and several younger ones. Then there are a couple of suitors for her cousin Cecilia, plus Charles’ fiancée, and household staff/guests. I found Sophy likeable and witty; She was by far my favorite character. To say Sophy was headstrong and independent is quite an understatement. Having traveled with her diplomat father, she’s met people all over and has a far greater skill and understanding of the world than is typical for someone her age and gender. She surprised those around her and endeared herself to most all she met. Sophy’s schemes about issues plaguing her cousins became involved at times and was the greatest focus of the story. Her romance with Charles – its beginning and development is more subtle. Not until I was almost done with the audiobook did, I realize it was abridged – being almost 5 hours long. After checking I found an unabridged version that is over 11 hours long. What a huge difference! Now, I wonder what all the abridged book left out. I plan to add an eBook TBR in the near future instead of the audio as I kept getting a few of the side characters confused (like Cecilia’s suitors and Charles’ fiancée). Overall, I enjoyed the book even if it was light on the romance because I am fond of witty humor, which Heyer seems to do well. "
161,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67951314-phrodrick,Rating 4 out of 5,"Somehow a serious review of Georgette Heyer’s The Grand Sophy is to miss the point. This is a confectioner’s book. The goal is to entertain the reader and leave them smiling. The goal is achieved. There is no violence, bad language or much of anything else to keep this from a family library.Lady Sophy Staton-Lacy arrives before us a young lady in need of a husband. She was raised to be an independent, resourceful thinking woman of her class. Raised I hasten to add by her diplomate playboy father in a house with no mother nor siblings. She is quickly proven to be a very accomplished horse woman and even more spectacularly a problem solver.Her not entirely respectable father is off on diplomatic business to Brazil and hopes her sister’s family Lord and Lady Ombersley and their assorted younger and older children can accommodate her and help her into proper London Society and a suitable match. The household is at sixes and sevens over its own needs. There is appending match between eldest son Charles with a dour, prissy and entirely too proper, if well to do Miss Eugenia Wraxton. Or as Lord Stanton-Lacy summarizes her: “ a dead Bore”. Also threatened is a potentially non-suitable marriage between eldest daughter Cecilia and a penniless, younger son who is worse yet poetically bent: Augustus Fawnhope.In other words Sophy arrives in a household filled with people addressing the usual upstairs problems of marrying the right kind of people. Fortunately the Grand Sophy is at hand.All of this reads much like a variation of the Wooster and Jeeves novels by P. G. Wodehouse. Between the two I prefer the sprightly silliness in the staid halls of Wodehouse. Less intimidating than the redoubtable Jeeves, Sophy always manages her way with nothing but lightness of spirit and when needed iron in her hands. Where Wodehouse gets it right is that once he establishes the formula, he keeps his stories short allowing you to space them out. Ms Heyer begins by setting a number of challenges to be met and met at once. Once we know just who is really in charge we know most of the story and all that is left are the particulars of each solution. To Ms Heyer’s credit there is entertainment in each solution."
162,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2544368-tara-chevrestt,Rating 3 out of 5,"This is my first Heyer novel. By the mostly rave reviews I see for her, I am wondering if I picked up the wrong one to start with. It was amusing, I will give it that. However, the prose was incredibly pompous. I had to get out my dictionary for at least one word on every page. Take this sentence for example: ""and the dutiful presentation to her erratic and far from grateful spouse of eight pledges of her affection had long since destroyed any pretensions to beauty in her. Her health was indifferent, her dispostion compliant..."" Are all those big fancy words really necessary?? I still cannot figure out the full meaning of that sentence. Not to speak ill of the dead, but throughout the entire novel, I was asking myself, ""Who was Heyer trying to impress?""Anyway, once I threw the dictionary away and just started ignoring the long, impressive words, the story was not bad. Sophy arrives to live with her aunt, uncle, and numerous cousins bringing with her an entourage consisting of a very skinny maid, a grumpy groom, a dog, a horse, a parrot, and a monkey. She then proceeds to disrupt her relatives' lives but in a good way. She meddles in everything. Sophy's female cousin, Cecilia is in love with a very dimwitted poet and the family has other marital plans for her. (So does Sophy!) Another cousin, Charles is set to marry a most dour lady (not if Sophy can help it!). Hubert has a gambling problem and Sophy runs into the situation with guns drawn. (Literally!) Basically, Sophy fixes everyone's problems. Good story, lots of fun, but no romance really. I am unclear as to why this would be branded a regency ""romance"". Besides the prose, my issue with this book is the style. The entire story is told via people's gossip and frivolous bantering. Sophy rides in the park, meets up with about four other people and they talk and talk and talk. I like to ""get to know"" the characters in a book and this did not give me that opportunity. It never once entered a character's head or told us their thoughts. It was all pompous chatter with big, amazing words. "
163,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1440151-nely,Rating 5 out of 5,"When Sophy Stanton-Lacy arrives at her aunt’s doorstep little did they know what was in store for them. Sophy’s father is off on business and has asked his sister to mind after Sophy (quite possibly even find her a suitable match). Her aunt, although a bit reluctant at first, agrees to take Sophy in and introduce her to the ton. But upon her arrival Sophy finds that her cousins’ lives are in a bit of disarray. For one, her cousin Cecilia is smitten with what the family considers an unsuitable suitor (a poet). Then there is her high-strung cousin Charles Rivenhall who is determined to marry a horribly prosy bluestocking. Using unorthodox methods, Sophie sets out to put everything to rights... but staying with her relatives could be her biggest challenge yet... especially since it seems that she has finally met her match. Sophy is a this fantastic, fun-loving, unconventional, and adorable heroine. In my book of heroines, she is only second to one Miss Elizabeth Bennett. The fact that her motivation for all her escapades is a desire to make other people happy makes her absolutely endearing. Her determination to force Mr. Rivenhall to lighten up and the inevitable battles that ensue provide pure delightful entertainment. Although at first you are not too fond of Mr. Rivenhall, he actually turns out to be the perfect gentleman with a need for exactly someone like Sophy to provide just what his life was lacking. All the secondary characters were just as entertaining as her main characters. I loved them all - from the distracted poet to the lazy, Spanish Marquesa, even all of the crazy animals. In the span of a few pages, Heyer manages to break three betrothals, create two new engagements, one marriage, and through it all leaves everyone, including the reader, perfectly satisfied. This is regency romance with a sense of humor. Sophy grabs you and takes you on a ride you don’t want to end. With fabulous characters, zany laugh-out-loud moments, and the need to see just what she will come up with next. You just HAVE to read this! "

Thanks, Nikki.This is an enchanting novel, one of Heyer’s best, although it’s not as funny as some of her other novels. It invites multiple gentle smiles and some snickers, not uproarious laughter.Sophy, a twenty-year-old daughter of a wealthy diplomat, has been raised by her father abroad. Now, he is sailing for Brazil and he asks his sister, Lady Ombersley, to give ‘his little Sophy’ a home in London, while he is gone. Sophy’s sojourn in London comprises the gist of the story.Vivacious and self-assured, with a kind heart and an inventive mind, Sophy sweeps into her aunt’s house and turns its rather grim occupants on their collective heads, introducing joy and upheaval into their previously dull lives. Sophy is a fixer, a troubleshooter, although her definition of the troubles needing shooting might be a bit unconventional. She doesn’t shy away from any unpleasant tasks, if she deems them necessary to achieve her goals, and she applies her considerable intellect and her sunny personality into improving the lives of all who come into her sphere. Even the dour Charles Rivenhall, the oldest son of the house and the undisputed tyrant of the family, can’t resist her charms or her meddling. She is an irresistible force, a gale of happiness, affecting everyone around her, whether they want it or not.The romance of Charles and Sophy seems inevitable, despite Charles’s betrothal, but the author’s easy acceptance of the idea of a marital relationship between first cousins stinks. It’s appeared in Heyer’s novels before, and I never liked it. Perhaps during Regency, such alliances were acceptable, but now, they would be heavily frowned upon. Other than this one aspect, this light caper of a book was a pure pleasure to read.As always, I’ve been on the prowl for new words, and I found one in this novel: rodomontade – bravado. Recommended to any fans of light romance. "

This is Sophy, the titular 'Grand Sophy': she can manage people perfectly, and make them like it too!Sir Horace (who is called so by his daughter, Sophy) sends his ""little Sophy"" to stay with his sister, Lady Ombersley, and her family.Lady Ombersley, meanwhile, standing as though rooted to her own doorstep, was realizing, with strong indignation, that the light in which a gentleman of great height and large proportions regarded his daughter had been misleading. Sir Horace's little Sophy stood five feet nine inches in her stocking-feet, and was built on generous lines, a long-legged deep bosomed creature, with a merry face, and a quantity of glossy brown ringlets under one of the most dashing hats her cousin had ever seen. Lady Ombersley and her family are unprepared in every way for tall, clever, rich and strong-minded Sophy, who is basically the Regency era equivalent of Wonder Woman. Sophy clashes with Charles, her equally strong-minded cousin, and sparks begin to fly (I guess back in those days cousins were perfectly fair game for romantic pursuit). Naturally, shenanigans ensue.I thought this was fun and witty escapist Regency fare. Unlike the bodice rippers that plague the genre of historical fantasy, this truly is reminiscent of Austen. The language ('Regency cant') reads authentically, and the characters are lively and spirited. The ending is suitably spectacular and amusing. ""Sir!"" said Lord Bromford, with as much dignity as can be expected of a man with both feet in a mustard bath, ""You shall answer to me for those words!""There are a few convoluted love polygons, but these entanglements are played for laughs. Recommended for Austen and even Woodhouse fans."

After this recent re-read for the GH group - I have upped it to a 5 because I was just totally entertained and immersed in the story!! This book is an absolute romp. Heyer picks one up quietly, but determinedly and does not let go until the last, joyous, entertaining and almost farcical last act. The introduction sets the scene in more ways than one. It is interesting that Sophy does not arrive for 2 chapters and when she does - we are ready for her. We are first introduced to Sophy through Sir Horace's depiction of his recent times abroad. We are given insight into the situation in which the Ombersleys find themselves and we are then thrown into the excitement of Sophy's arrival and realisation that if she doesn't do something to put the family to rights then it will be chaos. I might not appreciate having a Sophy trying to sort me out, but I really appreciate her machinations on behalf of the Ombersley clan. Sophy is no swooning, missish heroine; she is lively, intelligent, funny, caring and entertaining. I love her! The more I read this one, the more `I appreciate the slow burning romance that is developing between her and Charles throughout the story. I like the subordinate characters - Hubert is one of Heyer's more attractive adolescent boys. Once he is aware of the situation his brother has been facing alone, he immediately want to step up and play his part. what a sweetie! I love the brief introductions of real people who Sophy has met; it adds verisimilitude to the proceeding. Brilliantly plotted, intelligently humorous and a fabulous insight into life at the time - it is definitely one of Heyer's wee masterpieces. "

What with all the terrible author behavior lately it is starting to seem like a thankless task, though in my case, life circumstances also have a lot to do with it. At any rate, what you are seeing from me now and will probably continue to see for awhile are short reviews dashed off in spare moments. Sorry, all. **When I started this book, it was simply great fun. Sophy is the kind of heroine we'd all like to be - clever, daring, charismatic and utterly imperturbable - and therefore immediately endearing and fun to read about. And the Regency setting feels authentic, even when characters act in ways Jane Austen's creations would never have imagined.As the book dragged on, though, it lost its sparkle. Some of Sophy's escapades (such as the confrontation with the stereotypical filthy Jewish moneylender - ack!) seem over-the-top, and the romance underwhelms. Sophy and her love interest remain in the same holding pattern - she is charmingly outrageous and independent-minded, regularly reducing him to sputtering indignation, to her own amusement and that of the readers - for almost the entire book, without giving much impression of passion between them. Meanwhile the dialogue is overloaded with exclamation points, which become no more than visual pokes in the eye when they appear after 80% of the characters' utterances.Overall, probably a fun book for those who love Regency period novels, but after a promising start it proved not quite as charming as I'd anticipated. Devoted romance readers may feel differently."

Strong, witty, extremely intelligent, a little crazy and so very very lovely.Charles, oh Charles!!! The best of all heroes. Mr. Darcy has never been so much on the verge of losing his throne. He has a temper and so many responsibilities on his shoulders. He is bitter from the role life has cast him and betrothed to Eugenia, a person he believes is pure common sense but who is actually a dead bore and a terrible person. He is extremely smart. Oh-so-clever and honorable (just my kind of guy).Sophy is that kind of person that believes nothing is impossible if you really put your mind into it and, relentlessly manipulates all and sundry. It's wonderful to see how she manages to unmask Eugenia to Charles without ever saying anything explicit. And so nice to see how their minds were so alike, that he could read her that well. A romance so light, yet with such wonderful dialogues. Mrs. Heyer recognizes the reader as a thinking agent and lets he/she reach the conclusions without having to spit every single thing out.The result is really astonishing. I just wish there were an epilogue so we could have a little more of Sophy and Charles. I can just wonder how amazing they were together and how much joy they had in their relationship."

The Grand Sophy is pure delight. Sophy Stanton-Lacy, with a plan for every problem and a witty answer for every situation, turns her cousins' lives upside-down for the better and is infinitely entertaining every moment of doing it. She enters upon the wildest schemes and somehow makes it entirely believable that a well-bred young lady could do such things and, what's more, get away with them. And Charles, even though he spends most of his time in the position of antagonist—well, I couldn't help liking him all along. I liked how Heyer used little touches like his affection for his younger siblings to give glimpses at the other side of his character. Not to mention the large cast of supporting characters, each of them charming or funny in their own way, who all play a part in the involved romp of a plot. Honestly, I never thought anyone but Jane Austen could hold my interest in a Regency setting, but I was quite delighted with Heyer's grasp of the dialogue and the setting (though there is certainly quite a bit more action and outright humor here than Austen ever dreamed of). And the utterly hilarious screwball-comedy finale—ducklings, poet, mustard-bath and all. In short, I loved it."
170,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2481560-ahtims,Rating 3 out of 5,"This book was my ode to the month of Valentine. As a rule, I get bored by romance, but Georgette Heyer books were an exception in my younger days. When I started Grand Sophie, I was almost sure that it would be a 4 star, if not 5 star read. And the book kept up to the initial surmise till about the initial 60%. After that I started finding it contrived and monotonous. Gist - Sophie is a headstrong, opinionated, though fair minded girl who is forced to stay with her paternal aunt, as her father is bent upon going to Brazil as an ambassador. The Aunt's household is in turmoil due to various reasons - finance, love and gambling being the leading ones. Sophie takes it upon herself to put things right, especially with Cecilia, the cousin who matches her in age, and the eldest son, who is supposedly cold, domineering and controlling. She arrives at loggerheads with the son's equally goody-two-shoes fiancee who is disliked with fervour by other members of the family.How Sophie causes turmoil as well as peace to the various members of the family forms the gist of the story.Finally, all the young unmarried people are paired up to everybody's advantage."

All the negative Jewish stereotypes are craftily used. I don't care if the book is historically accurate or brilliantly written with wit and banter. I cannot tolerate such blatant bigotry. I will make my point with few quotes from the book.""And I may have a dashed disagreeable brother, holding so tightly to the purse-strings that you'd think he was a Jew""""Faced with large debts of honour, already in hot water with his formidable brother for far smaller debts, what could he do but jump into the river, or go to the Jews?""And there is of course a stereotyped Jewish moneylender who is ""a thin, swarthy individual, with long greasy curls, a semitic nose, and an ingratiating leer""The author evokes a feeling of disgust when she describes the moneylender's filthy apartment and his stingy nature. At this point, I stopped caring about the story because it was offensive and insensitive. Maybe I read the uncensored version because the anti-semitism is not hard to miss in this book. I cannot explain the great reviews otherwise."
172,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1969357-jane-ps,Rating 5 out of 5,"Loved it yet again! It might topple some of my other favourites Heyer books from their prime positions - although I think The Unknown Ajax is pretty safe as my absolute GH favourite!Sophy and Charles, the two main characters, have such strong personalities with wonderfully endearing qualities, you can't help but really love them. Admittedly Charles takes a fair bit longer, but he really shines towards the end, and he is delightfully amusing throughout (with his frequent loss of temper and exasperation with Sophy).Yet again, I love Heyer's turn of phrase and her masterful depiction of idiosyncratic characters. Even minor characters are given a succinct and deft outline. It is all done so neatly. Heyer rarely dwells for too long on any one event, moving the story along at a good pace. She allows one to dwell on the enjoyment of the moment, but does not let the reader get bogged down in detail."

(And I'm in my 50s. :)) She makes the book - her quick wit, lively humor and good nature make her one of the most lovable young women in literature. This book is towards the top of many ""best book"" lists for a reason. Sophy is dropped on her very proper relatives and finds everyone unhappy. Two of her cousins are in inappropriate relationships and Sophy, using psychology and military tactics learned from following her diplomat father around the continent during the Napoleonic War, sets out to straighten things up. Clever as she is, not everything goes according to her plan, but everyone eventually gets their happy ending. Whenever I want a novel that will make me smile and leave me feeling happier than I was when I started it, this title always springs to mind. I consider it Heyer's best, which makes it unparalleled."

Well especially me, since I tend to multitask. Listen and work. So I had to pick up a copy and read it. And The Grand Sophy is a real delight.The book is clean, which is very unusual compared to the historical books I usually end up reading. I usually enjoy a little provocativeness. But still! I adored Sophy. She is a planner/ manipulator and her eccentricity is refreshing. However, there is one fact that irks me. The fact that Sophy and Charles are first cousins? Am I the only one who thinks that is weird or have I misunderstood? But this fact did not diminish my enjoyment of the book.For sure, I will pick more Georgette Heyer's books as I just discovered what a delight her writing is!"

I am nonplussed.I will tolerate the casual racism typical of Heyer's work as a product of it's time--the excitable French and lazy Spaniards are usually drawn with some affection. But in this book we get an outright Shylockian loan shark, greasily ""Semitic"", hooked nose and all--which goes several steps beyond too far. However, here is the conflict: Sophy is one of my favourite heroines. She is tall and brassy and fearless. She sails into an unhappy household and briskly sets about improving everything. She copes with tyrants, engagements, a Spanish Marquessa, Typhus, the aforementioned loan shark, several ducklings and a monkey. The story is a witty tangle of plots and plotting, and I enjoy it very much evey time, except for wincing over Mr. Goldhanger for a few pages in the middle."

This is one of my faves of hers.I love Sophy, a woman who charts her course and is never daunted. It's easy to see why she's called THE GRAND SOPHY. She never thinks small. And you have to love a heroine who arrives with a monkey as a gift to the children of the house. The hero has met his match in Sophie. Humor graces every scene. Imagine a Regency heroine going to a loan shark and pulling out a pistol, then scolding him about not sweeping his floors. Outrageous. Wonderful! Finally, I especially love the final scenes where a poet walks in and out among ducklings while sweethearts unite and break apart at each interruption. I dare you to read it and not laugh!"

That said, it is also uni-dimensional, anti-semitic and NOT historically accurate. The myth about G. Heyer being the ""best"" Regency researcher is false, what she did was a detailed and self coherent fictional world building of a cartoonish Regency reality where characters are stereotypical portrayals of racist and classist society, that corresponds better with a 20th Century White, European, Aristocratic bias, who are seeing their lifestyle and worldview crumble, and hold on to their past social order & privilege for dear life, in the only way they can... through fiction.

Sarah Woodward is a new-to-me narrator and very good. After listening to several Georgette Heyer romances, I have been struck by how well some of them would translate to the stage, and listening to The Grand Sophy felt something like listening to a radio play. Sophy herself was a bit more palatable to me, but I still think she is a bossy, know-it-all who interferes in everyone's lives. Granted she does it for the best of reasons, and her victims are usually happier (even the villainess gets her HEA), but she is the very definition of a ""managing female."""

Acknowledging the racism present in this book, not just the blatant representation of the Jewish moneylender, but also Spaniards, and probably more that I missed, I still found Sophy a delightful and incredibly resourceful heroine. The humour is so enjoyable, and the sly send up of so many stereotypes (it's unforgivable that that was only extended to Brits) was a delight to listen to. On the same level as Frederica, although marred too deeply by the attitudes to attain that love.Audio: The narrator is quite good, she does a fantastic job of making each character clear, and does well with voices for all of them."

Je n'avais pas prévu de lire de Régence cette année, mais celle-ci est fort différente de toutes celles que j'ai pu lire, sans doute parce que l'édition originale date de 1950.

191,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4912586-melissa,Rating 4 out of 5,"Has this book been made into a BBC mini-series yet? It really deserves to be a mini-series. The characters within its pages are delightful. So delightful. They just jump off the page and demand to be noticed. Sophy may be my absolute favorite regency romance heroine of all times. She's like Emma Woodhouse without the wealthy air about her. She's meddlesome, but in that sort of endearing way that can't help but draw others to her side. She's self-assured in a way that is almost shocking to everyone around her. She is loyal and fun and intelligent and brave. I adored her. This book is labeled as a regency romance, but, let's be honest ... this is not really a romance. Sure lots of people end up finding their significant other by the end of the book, but their love stories are not really the focus of this story. The journeys of love, such as they are, are really not central to this story. Sophy is central to this story. If no one had ended up together at the end of the story it would have still been a lovely book, and that means a lot coming from my romance loving soul. I love love, and I demand Happily Ever Afters in my romances ... but in this book I would have been perfectly okay if the book had ended with Sophy and Charles and every other character just ending up in the drawing room looking drolly at one another. It was a great story outside of any romance. In fact, the proposal that ends this book may be (not 'may be', it IS) the strangest and least romantic proposal I've ever read. And yet it was perfect. I loved it.All of the supporting cast of this book were lovely. The quirks of each of them greatly enhanced the book. Even the worst of the characters were fun to read about. I listened to the audio book of this, but I want to go back and read a kindle version so that I can take some time to savor each of the characters individually.As for the audio book ... Sarah Woodward's narration was PERFECT. She perfectly captured the mood of the book. She captured each character perfectly. I could have listened to her over and over. If you are looking for a clean regency romance that focuses on character development more than heaving bosoms or explicit sexual scenes this is the book for you. It is delightful. It's my first Georgette Heyer book, but it won't be my last. It gets a strong four stars from me. I really liked it."
192,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39640816-lau-suigeneris,Rating 4 out of 5,"Me vi la serie Bridgerton como en dos días y algo resurgió en mí: recordé que amo la época de la Regencia con toda la fuerza de mi alma. A penas terminé el último capítulo me puse inmediatamente a buscar los libros en los que se basa, pero claramente no eran lo que quería. Son de la época, sí, pero tienen mucho serso y toxicidades varias sin la excusa de ser una serie de Shonda Rhimes para permitirme apreciarlos. Así que empecé a explorar opciones y entre mis escarbos por Goodreads apareció The Grand Sophy. Y resultó ser exactamente todo lo que necesitaba en mi vida.Si tuviera que describirlo en corto, este libro es toda la ambientación y el feel de Orgullo y Prejuicio, pero con el mamarracheo potenciado al mil por ciento. No busquen comentario social ni novela costumbrista, porque no lo encontrarán, pero si lo que quieren es el contexto de la Regencia captado en su máximo esplendor, llegaron al lugar indicado. Le tenemos el clásico witty dialogue, la protagonista empoderada, mucho intercambio de miradas, discusiones sobre etiqueta y, mi favorito, el interés romántico haciendo el ademán de tomar la mano de la heroína y arrepintiéndose a último minuto.De verdad no puedo expresar en palabras todo lo que gocé, especialmente el último 20% que fue puro grito y risitas fangirls. Amé a los personajes, sus relaciones y sus dramas. Nuestra protagonista, Sophy, es como Emma, pero potenciada al cubo y con planes loquísimos que efectivamente funcionan, lo que hace imposible no amarla. Por el otro lado, Charles, su contraparte romántica que posee la hamartía de ser su primo, tiene una dinámica tan entretenida con Sophy que a una se le llegan a olvidar sus sensibilidades de siglo XXI y no puede hacer más que shippear.Como verán, tiene algunas cosas medias problemáticas—incluyendo varios párrafos bastante antisemíticos en un capítulo específico—, pero para haber sido escrito en los 50s, es francamente una joya. Si están cansades de los romances históricos llenos de machos alfa y sexo descontrolado, les aseguro que esta novela es la solución a sus problemas.Así que aquí me tienen, completamente obsesionada e incapaz de leer nada que no tenga corsets o mujeres siendo presentadas en sociedad. Y aparentemente la amiga Georgette es la mejor proveedora de esa particular droga... Odiaría haber nacido en la Regencia, absolutamente, pero puta que amo romantizarla y leerla. "
193,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Grand Sophy is Heyer at her very best. Sophy has lived abroad with her father but now she's in London, learning to know her cousins, the Rivenhalls. The parents, Lord and Lady Ombersley are rather languid characters and the eldest brother Charles is the real head of the household. He is engaged to Miss Wraxton who is rather stuffy and values propriety more than kindness. One of his sisters, Cecilia, is expected to marry Lord Charlbury but she fancies herself in love with a penniless poet. His brother Hubert is worried about something. Sophy will clash with Charles and put everything to rights. This is a brilliant book because the dialogue and the writing is so witty and because Sophy is such a clever, resourceful character, not a damsel in distress under any circumstances. She is cheerful and unflappable, very observant and uses reverse psychology to a magnificent effect to steer people into making better choices. This edition has a foreword by Eloisa James and some ethnic stereotypes regarding the villainous money lender character have been cleaned up."
194,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16328320-ioana-johansson,Rating 5 out of 5,"I have read this book so many times that I have lost count. Sophy has always been my favorite Heyer heroine. What is there not to like? A vibrant, determined, ruthless 20-year-old girl who runs circles around everyone else. She is always one step and one plan ahead. I think I first fell in love with her when I read this: ""'Very bad business,' said Mr. Wychbold. 'Nothing to be done, though.''That,' said Sophy severely, 'is what people always say when they are too lazy, or perhaps too timorous, to make a push to be helpful! I have a great many faults, but I am not lazy, and I am not timorous[...]"". Sophy is never shy when it comes to being helpful. She shines not only as an example of a wonderful lady of her time, but she is as actual and worthy of imitation in any epoch. It could be argued that she might sometimes be just TOO much. Too intelligent, too ready, too courageous, too determined. Just over the top. But it isn't something that genuinely bothered me. On the contrary, sometimes it is refreshing to follow such a heroine and see how all the dominoes align. The rest of the cast is as masterfully drawn as I have been used to in all Heyer books. This book is and will remain one of my favorite reads—a delightful, purely fun romp to be enjoyed at any time."

Heyer uses a lot! Of exclamation points! And that gets old! But I can ignore that as a quaintly dated writing style. Oh, I also lost track of some of the characters … there was one in particular who kept popping up and I had no idea who he was supposed to be, but I was too lazy to page back to find his introduction.Sophy was delightful and I laughed out loud towards the end. Everything is ridiculous. I would like to see this as a movie and I anticipate picking it up again someday as a mood-lifting read. "

Otherwise the vivacious and bold but caring heroine is easy to root for, the cousins are prime for shaking up, and the turn of the century take on regency romance is much more action packed and humorous than much of the writing of the period. Would make a fantastic BBC period drama."

A good book to work on big vocab with her.I have to say, as I was reading, as a writer, I was imagining how much more fun and more fulfilling it would have been written in deep POV, instead of a narrative omniscient. But quite the fun ""mischievous"" heroine that still felt of her times. A very ""good"" villain in that she was quite detestable and believable."

First of all, this book needs an editor--there is too much going on and I found myself skimming paragraphs trying to get to the story. Plot points are kind of haphazardly flung in to add drama. And the ending, um, strange?? Supposed to be romantic but mostly overtones of weird aggression.I mean, I did enjoy this because it's regency and Heyer obviously is a master of research. And the far-fetched plot and the over-the-top Sophy are a lot of fun. But Jane Austen this SOOOO isn't."
214,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2572841-mai,Rating 3 out of 5,"Very agreeable fluff! Georgette Heyer may have essentially invented the modern regency genre but she's a cut far above what Mills and Boon are churning out these days. Although you really wouldn't want to take it too seriously or expect very deep characterisation, the level of historical detail that she includes (guilty admission time: I really enjoy all the descriptions of the Regency outfits) and her excellent instinct for farce make for a thoroughly enjoyable read. I've heard that Heyer's plots get pretty repetitive but as this was my first encounter with her, I didn't have that problem. The book centres on an aristocratic family in London who are all just a little bit miserable. As their weak-willed father has run up enormous gambling debts, the stern eldest son, Charles, having received a separate inheritance from a different family member, has to take over running of the household, and it's all a little grim. His terrible fiancée makes everyone's life a misery, and the eldest daughter is infatuated with a very romantic, but very unsuitable man. Enter Sophy: Sophy is their first cousin, dumped on them by her jetsetting (or whatever the 19th-century equivalent of a jet is) diplomat father, and she's pretty much a very charming bit of wish fulfilment. Blessed with generosity, style and oodles of money, she takes one look at the sad lives of the Stanton-Laceys and resolves to put everything in order. This inevitably involves horse-riding, parties, about 3 different, interconnected love triangles, and, in a major high point, ducklings. Of course, being an interfering little madam, she gets right up her micro-managing cousin's nose. In Regency World, this can only mean True Love (and it's very funny and cute if you can get over the cousin aspect ... I guess it was less weird back then).Of course, every plot point was telegraphed a mile off and most of the drama hinges on who's going to end up with whom, but yeah I liked it. I do wish that the indomitable Sophy had shown a little more vulnerability. Characters who can do literally Everything (she sews, she rides every horse perfectly, she makes jokes, she flirts, she shoots, she faces down evil loan sharks (!!!), she can read everyone's mind and knows what's best for all of them) are fun up to a point, but eventually I find that I can't really relate to them. You just want them to show a little human emotion! I also felt that it ended very abruptly (and in a not terribly PC way. I'm not sure you'd get away with threatening to strangle someone during a proposal these days. On the other hand, I fully understand that anyone who'd lived with Sophy for a few months would be madly in love with her and probably want to throttle her), but as it's not the kind of book you take too seriously anyway, none of that really matters. In the end, it's just the lightest and most entertaining kind of light entertainment."

‘Charles!’ uttered Sophy, shocked. ‘You cannot love me!’Mr Rivenhall pulled the door to behind them, and in a very rough fashion jerked her into his arms, and kissed her. ‘I don’t: I dislike you excessively!’ he said savagely.Entranced by these lover-like words, Miss Stanton-Lacy returned his embrace with fervour, and meekly allowed herself to be led off to the stables.

Writing this review after my second read-through of The Grand Sophy, I feel like I’ve got a pretty solid handle on the book. This book is, by and large, the most popular among modern readers of Georgette Heyer’s large body of work (though I can’t definitively say that it’s her best novel). For myself, I enjoyed this book and found it to be amusing, but wasn’t absolutely in love with it.The book’s protagonist, Sophy Stanton-Lacy is very much the driving force behind the text. She’s irrepressibly mischievous, smart-mouthed, charming, and strong-willed—a combination that makes Sophy not at all the typical young lady in 1816 London society. Because of our unique protagonist, The Grand Sophy is far from dull, whether Sophy is facing off with her hot-tempered cousin Charles or facing down a villainous moneylender with nothing but chutzpah and a pistol.My favorite part of the book is definitely Sophy and her antics, as well as her frequent clashes with Charles, her cousin and love interest (eewww, first cousinly romance). Yet in other areas, The Grand Sophy drags—all of the Rivenhalls are quite dull and/or silly, and while I’m not opposed to Charles in a general sense, I’m not the biggest fan of him. Heyer spends too much time setting up his character in frequent and boisterous opposition to Sophy for me to take their sudden engagement in the final 10 pages quite seriously. With all the arguing they do, I’m not sure how successful their marriage will be; the author doesn’t really show the two of them in any situation that even resembles a healthy romantic relationship.Much as The Grand Sophy made me laugh, I don’t think it will prove to be memorable. After my first read, the only thing I remembered about the book was the quote at the beginning of this review, which I found fairly amusing. Otherwise, I’m only mildly satisfied with this book, and my (thus far) only foray into Georgette Heyer’s impressive backlist. Hopefully future efforts with this author will make more of an impression on me.📌 . Blog | Review Database | Twitter | Instagram | Goodreads"

217,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38964386-lucy,Rating 4 out of 5,"Goodreads synopsis: When the redoubtable Sir Horace Stanton-Lacy is ordered to South America on Diplomatic Business he parks his only daughter Sophy with his sister's family, the Ombersleys, in Berkeley Square. Upon her arrival, Sophy is bemused to see her cousins are in a sad tangle. The heartless and tyrannical Charles is betrothed to a pedantic bluestocking almost as tiresome as himself; Cecilia is besotted with a beautiful but quite feather-brained poet; and Hubert has fallen foul of a money-lender. *NO SPOILERS AHEAD*The most memorable aspect of this story is the heroine: The Grand Sophy herself. Vibrant, bold, and intelligent, Sophy is like a breath of fresh air when it comes to regency romance heroines. Using her charm and wits, she seamlessly improves the lives of those around her, and orchestrates their (as well as her own) happy ending. While reading, I continued to see Sophy as a very much more successful version of Jane Austen's character- Emma. The many colorful supporting characters are all enjoyable, each being different from the last and bringing something entertaining to the story. For example, The Ombersley family alone includes a gambling father, a neurotic mother, a smitten daughter, a son with money-troubles, and an elder son who has lost his sense of humor. The writing style is very sophisticated, which doesn't make it the easiest book to read, but was still very enjoyable and blended well with the time period. The dialogue between the characters is also entertaining, especially the witty back-and-forth between Charles and Sophy - this book is most definitely a family/romantic comedy. So you are probably wondering by now why I haven't given this book 5 stars? Well it's because of two problems; one major, one minor. The first is that I found it really difficult to pick this book up after I'd put it down. The pace of the story is quite slow and, despite the plot never running dry, I found myself feeling the itch to skim pages. Bored is far too strong a word for it, but on several occasions I felt my interest slightly wavering while reading this book. The second problem, is that around the half-way mark there is a villainous Jewish moneylender, who is presented in a very stereotypical and discriminating fashion. True the scene lasts for only a few pages, but it was uncomfortable to read. That being said, this was an entertaining read and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of historical comedy dramas."

If you've never read a Georgette Heyer Regency she is the gold standard against which other Regency Romance authors are compared. Her work is beautiful researched but still delightfully readable: filled with fascinating characters, complex plots and beautiful settings. Sophy is the daughter of a diplomat who is sent to stay with English relatives who do not know her. They are expecting a shy and timid mouse - are they in for a BIG surprise!Sophy arrives complete with a monkey and a parrot [which was not raised in a vicarage] for the children, an Italian greyhound at her feet and her personal groom and maid in attendance. She is tall and although not classically beautiful, her vivacious charm wins over all the family members in the first meeting except Charles, the dour eldest son. Charles is pained by his cousin's behavior. She is forward, bold, out-spoken and a bad influence on his family. Already she is encouraging sister Cecilia's unfortunate infatuation with a poet, encouraging brother Hubert to confide in her rather than himself, fascinating the children and befriending his mother. Everyone loves her except Charles' fiancée...Sophy is never bored, there is always something, or someone, to put to rights and she finds ample situations in her newly acquired family. There's Cecilia who is weeping over her poet and the 'older man' they want her to marry, there's Hubert who is obviously laboring under a heavy burden of worry, and Charles who has become a domestic tyrant and is engaged to a truly tedious girl which he intends to inflict on the family by moving her into the house after the wedding. But she's set worse situations to rights, it's only a matter of planning and initiative...The book abounds with wits, rakes, snobs and eccentrics, all fashionably dressed and involved in a whirlwind of social activities. It sparkles with intelligent, witty and charming conversation. The plot has a satisfying number of twists without anyone stumbling over a dead body or kidnapping the king or even losing a diamond necklace. The romance is warm and believable. Like most of Georgette Heyer's work, this is a stand alone novel."
220,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16553419-vibliophile,Rating 5 out of 5,"(4.5 stars) - one of Heyer's funnest Written by Heyer in 1950, with a Regency setting of 1816, there are a number of elements to trigger modern politically correct sensibilities - if you're one, I'm not even sure why you would be here, get over it or move on, lol.Charles is a man who has been forced to take charge of his family's finances as a result of his father's irresponsibility. That burden has made him the de facto head of the family, as well as a stiff & rather cranky man. His humorless, rigid fiancée has aided & abetted his unhappy transformation. Sophy is a woman who has figured out how to navigate her world - and to rule it - & readily takes over the household during her visit, somewhat to Charles bafflement and frustration. In all fairness, we must acknowledge that Sophy is very much a mary sue character, but this is one of those plots where it totally works. She's one of those characters who knows what's best for everyone - in other words, fictional, so please don't try this at home. Sophy sees what's amiss in the family, and promptly gets to work setting all to right.Charles is a classic alpha male and has a temper to boot. He's torn between admiration & irritation for his cousin (yes, cousin - it's Regency England; it won't be until Victoria's era that the hemophilia gene cropped up in the royal line which eventually helped us to understand how unhealthy such close connections are). The dialogue between Charles & Sophy, as well as Sophy and pretty much everyone else, is sparkling with wit. The romance is quite subtle and minimal, but it's a bit of a distance to travel from ""she drives me crazy & I'd like to throttle her"" to ""she drives me crazy & I'd like to kiss her"" and Heyer's focus on the transition is what makes it work. Arguably, Heyer may have focused too much on getting Charles there and not enough on showing us how & when Sophy arrived. Nevertheless, the denouement is absolutely the best part & fills the reader with enough good will to forgive Heyer for her typical abrupt ending.  *Clean romance level: sweet kisses *Religion/Language: standard Regency expressions using God's Name in vain, sadly, & about a dozen d*mns"
221,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8214974-a,Rating 5 out of 5,"2022 re-read: still one of the best Heyers. I just chuckle the entire way through! This time I listened to the audiobook, and it was brilliant. The romance between the hero and heroine is probably one of the best developed, a slow-burn enemies-to-lovers where the hero is repressing his attraction as strongly as he can (since he's already committed to a very-proper marriage of convenience before he and the heroine first meet).The pivotal moment when he suddenly realises what he truly feels towards Sophythat night they meet in Amabel's room is so under-stated (because as soon as he realises it, he realises the impossibility of acting on that knowledge) that younger-me missed it, but on re-reads it hits so intensely. Swoon!I adore this book. Georgette Heyer provides pretty much everything one could possibly want from a regency romance, and The Grand Sophy is one of her best. This is in large part due to the heroine, Sophy. I think Sophy's wit and lively charm is best illustrated with a quote: 'I shall be much obliged to you, cousin, if you will refrain from telling my sisters that she has a face like a horse!’ ‘But, Charles, no blame attaches to Miss Wraxton! She cannot help it, and that, I assure you, I have always pointed out to your sisters!’ ‘I consider Miss Wraxton’s countenance particularly well-bred!’ ‘Yes, indeed, but you have quite misunderstood the matter! I meant a particularly well-bred horse!’  'You mean, as I am perfectly aware, to belittle Miss Wraxton!' 'No, no! I am very fond of horses!' Sophy said earnestly. Before he could stop himself he found that he was replying to this. 'Selina, who repeated the remark to me, is not fond of horses, however, and she-' He broke off, seeing how absurd it was to argue on such a head. 'I expect she will be, when she has lived in the same house with Miss Wraxton for a month or two,' said Sophy encouragingly.Content notesAntisemitism - there's a scene with a caricatured Jewish moneylender.Audiobook notesI listened to the one narrated by Sarah Woodward and it was really good."
222,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3139413-rosina-lippi,Rating 4 out of 5,"Many fine writers of romance list The Grand Sophy as one of their favorite novels, and as it was recently re-issued, I finally picked it up. It's also my first venture into the world of Georgette Heyer. I have been meaning to read her books for years, I have no idea what kept me so long.This is, without a doubt, one of the most amusing love stories I've read in a long time. The characters are priceless, the plotting without flaw. It's a first class romance, which means simply this: you know right away that in spite of all obstacles, Sophy will end up with Charles. What you don't know is, how that will come about. Much in the same way you know Elizabeth Bennett will end up with Fitzwilliam Darcy: the fun is in getting there, and Heyer takes you on a wild ride.I think Sophy must rank up there with Elizabeth Bennett in terms of sheer memorable characterization. She is the kind of woman who refuses to stay on the page, who climbs out and follows you around long after you've put the book down. And who could mind? We could all use a Sophy to liven up our days and make order out of chaos.And still, there's a problem I just can't get over: Heyer's love affair with the exclamation point. I hate 'em. Always have. It is possible that it wasn't Heyer, but her editor who salted a great novel with !!! It's true that these books were written fifty years ago and literary styles change, but I had the hardest time getting past this punctuation issue. In fact, I counted twenty five of the little buggers on one page. It's really too bad, because otherwise the dialog is clever and revealing. I think if they re-issued it (yet again) but deleted 99.9% of the exclamation points, I would have loved this without reservation. I'll have to check out other editions. Maybe there's one out there without this particular small, but irritating, problem."

And the Rivenhalls are about to find out that Sir Horace's ""dear little soul...not an ounce of vice in her"" is not exactly what they had expected.For Sophy isn't one to sit back and watch other people's lives fall apart when, with just a bit of a push and some courage, one can help them through the muddle. Lord knows, the Rivenhalls have plenty of problems with Lord Ombersley's debts, Charles' taking on the management of the family and its fortunes...as well as his so-very-saintly fiancée, Hubert's youthful problems, and poor Cecilia's love affair with the beautiful, but ineligible, poet.The CharactersI think Sophy is the woman we all want to be. Confident, caring, and completely herself ""without an ounce of vice in her"" while Eugenia Wraxton embodies all that is unChristian with her tattling and overbearing strictures on what's proper.Charles Rivenhall is a man teetering on the edge. Overwhelmed with his father's careless waste of the family money. Desperate to bring things back to rights, he's easy prey for someone like Miss Wraxton. It takes a Grand Sophy to open his eyes and bring joy back to the Rivenhall family.My TakeNot Heyer's usual style, The Grand Sophy, is just that. Grand. Sophy is larger than life and with an open, realistic view on life which drives everyone around her nuts if only because it's so unexpected of the women of her time and station. She's an excellent example of the Christian ideal in her acceptance and trust in people. Not that Sophy is naive, for she is well aware of type and plans well for it.Read it and laugh. Laugh your way through Sophy's approach to life."

Sophy is a meddler, and in the tradition of that other outrageous meddler, Flora Post of ‘Cold Comfort Farm’ she’s scheming, stylish, snobbish and funny.Sophy, unlike Flora, seems to more genuinely like and want to help the people she’s manipulating … but then the Rivenhalls are nowhere near as messy as the Starkadders. However as a character Sophy suffers from the same lack of character growth as Flora does, and the same lack of any real suffering before she reaches her happy ending. Both are unsatisfying protagonists as they start and end the book in much the same place. However, this is one of my favourite Georgette Heyer novels, and it was comforting to revisit it in audio format. While funny, it has its flaws. Heyer doesn’t really pull the romance off between Sophy and Charles. While she subtly hints at the feelings Charles is developing for Sophy, I’m never completely convinced that Sophy is actually worried that she won’t get him in the end, or that if she doesn’t, she’ll suffer overmuch for it.I’ve read articles, and the review on this page, that point out Heyer’s anti-Semitism. It can’t help but colour the way I read the book now.What keeps the book at its five star rating for me is my memories of reading this for the first time. I was fourteen and I’d just discovered Heyer, and would spend years obsessively hunting down copies of her novels in second hand shops, trying to get that one set of all the painted Pan covers. I remember my dad picking up ‘The Grand Sophy’ and telling me I shouldn’t be reading such trash. Then he started reading it aloud, and he started laughing. He didn’t give it back until he was finished."

In this story, Sir Horace visits his sister and tells her that he is sending his daughter to stay with her for a time. No one expects Sophy. She is bright, witty, daring, and completely goes against the grain. She brings the younger children in the family a pet monkey. Really...who does that? She buys herself a phaeton and races it like no other. She doesn't act prim, proper, and shy, like most of the other girls her age. There's no one she irritates more than her cousin, the one in control of the finances and properties--Charles. And annoy him she does!Sophy is an extremely fun character! She really could care less what people think of her. How would it be to really not care and to be yourself? Especially in a day when everyone tried to fit in the mold. She does what she has to do to help those around her, even if she finds herself in unusual and seemingly dangerous situations. One of those situations was my favorite--I loved it when she went to visit the money lender. The way she handled him had me laughing out loud--especially when $$$ finds out. She's a busybody, trying to manage and arrange the lives of all those around her, yet she does it in an almost endearing way. She's a master of reverse psychology and really knows how people work.Charles is so stuffy and uptight, yet we get a glimpse of why he is the way he is and it all makes sense. Still, I felt that sometimes Sophy acted the way she did just to get a reaction out of him. She seemed to love to catch him with his own words and turn them against him.All in all, a perfectly delightful book that really shows the Regency period at its finest.Content: some mild language, no intimate scenes, no real violence.

228,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5482096-shantelle,Rating 3 out of 5," I decided I should read by Georgette Heyer because I kept seeing her books on lists I looked at, and noticed many of them are also set during the Regency era. I was slightly worried her books would be like Jane Austen's, because she is an older author (I have the HARDEST time getting into Jane Austen's novels). But, I picked up The Grand Sophy from the library anyway.  So, this is what I felt. The Grand Sophy was definitely not as action-packed and fast-paced as most of now-day's novels are, but neither was it as hard to read as Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. I could understand it just fine; it was just slower paced and mostly lengthily conversations. So I would say, if you are a Regency era-lover, like-Jane Austen, reader-of-more-classic-books, The Grand Sohpy is probably for you.  Some things I DID NOT like about The Grand Sophy: the swearing, which came often enough (a far amount by Mr. Rivenhall!). And the constant misusing of God's name, which bothered me to no end!!  Otherwise, The Grand Sophy is a humorous, quirky story of determined, lively cousins and tangles-up romances. I did like it. But since it took me longer to read than most other books, I probably won't read by Georgette Heyer that often. "

Dec 2018: sadly less fun than the first time, though Sophy was just as lovable read by Sarah Woodward on Hoopla audio through my public library. Too many similar names were a bit confusing. I appreciated the hero’s growth, but there was a bit too much violent-embraces alpha male fantasy at the end, which wasn’t at all in keeping with the rest of the book. I hate Sophie’s submission to this treatment with the heat of a thousand suns, it’s offputting. And...he wouldn’t act like that and she wouldn’t accept that, so who are these people and where did they put my H&h? But the high level of farce keeps this quite a good read. Hmm.

I enjoy the heroine and find her delightful and the story line completely diverting and enjoyable. I find that it is a bit of a historical (although honestly even historic could be a-bit of a stretch - it’s placed in the past and the word choices, manners and clothing choices are often referred to but not much past that) comedic romance - and that this genre is very much the writing style of Miss Heyer. Her novels have a type of formula in which, at books end everything falls into place and everyone lives happily after some madcap escapades, adventures, schemes and plans. Villains are put in their place and we are allowed the luxury of being able to look at people simplistically. I find them to be a great respite to the mental aerobics most of our lives require and so I am really enjoying a run at reading her books which I seem to devour. Her books are not bodice rippers and rather end with a passionate kiss and embrace which is always accompanied by a proposal of marriage by a delicious hero. I give it 4 stars for delivering what it promises and my promise is that I’m sure to read more. Very addicting light reads."

The anti-Semitism in here is horrible, and after reading that particular scene (referenced even in Heyer’s Wikipedia page), I couldn’t enjoy the book any longer. Truly, its only saving grace was that everything else about the book worked really well, and in Sophy, you can see both Jane Austen’s best heroines and the heroines that are Heyer’s legacy. You can even see the precedent Sophy and Charles set for enemies-to-lovers in the genre of historical romance.But between Heyer’s clear anti-Semitism (and here, I would say that it is not so much as for the sake of making the time period “authentic” [which I would say is 75% of Julia Quinn’s motivation in the Rokesbys books]—the way it is written, it is a clear mark of the mid-20th century and the author’s own anti-Semitic views) and the Austen-like way in which she wrote, I will pass on Heyer from now on, except for, maybe, the one other book I have checked out by her already."

It's weird. And there are a lot of problematic stereotypes that I really, really don't love (anti-Semitism, but not only that. Sometimes, even though there are bad guys from the ""Ton,"" there is a bit of ""wealth and status = better overall being"" that I also stumble over in Dickens and Austen, as well: they knew better, but it's literally an in-bred attitude.

Por mais que ela fosse uma mulher um pouco...detestável, dificilmente alguém poderia culpá-la já que ela é apenas um reflexo das mulheres daquela época. Eu estava tão apreensiva de que ela acabaria em desvantagem por ser a ""vilã"" da história, mas na verdade o final dela é tão satisfatório como o de todos os outros)."

I have no idea how it compares to others but based on this I’m not keen to pick up any of her other books. For various reasons. One being the unchallenged antisemitism in the book. Another being the prominent use of the word „female“ as a noun. It was also hard to read as I had trouble with how Heyer constructed most of her sentences. I also didn’t much like the characters and plot. So yeah I guess this book wasn’t for me. Somehow I still had the tiniest amount of fun reading this, but I wouldn’t have finished it if I hadn’t been reading it with a friend and overall I could not recommend it.Also I don’t really think the book qualifies a romance."

I loved Sophy and her cleverness, her quick instinct about people and take charge attitude. The woman was practically perfect in every way. I loved Heyer's prose, wit, dialogue, characters and mad-cap farcical comedy and sense of family she weaves into her stories. She has an amazing way of bringing her characters and their world to life. I can't wait to read more of Heyer's books and I hope they are all as enjoyable as The Grand Sophy and Frederica."

One of my favourite heroines. So original and innovative! Love the scene with the pistol! Charles is crude and not your typical Heyer hero but he touches the heart somewhere. Amazing story, great flow. The characters of Lady Ombersely, Cecilia and Sir Horace are lovable. Miss Wraxton equally detestable! Must read. #GeorgetteHeyerMagic "

The ending of cousin marrying cousin doesn't even particularly bother me, although in real life it will always be totally, absolutely no-no. What did bother me this time - and I can't understand why it never struck me before - was the horrid cliché Jewish moneylender, description straight from a Nazi textbook: Semitic nose, the ""instinct of his race"" and his behaviour, well, it left an unpleasant taste. The whole scene is unworthy of Georgette Heyer, rather clumsy and childish. It is rather short, and while it did not completely ruin the book for me, it made me cringe.

To my own utter surprise I truly enjoyed it. As others have mentioned, there's some stereotypical racism which is hard to excuse, even by saying it was written in the 1950s and is set in Regency times. But beyond that I enjoyed Sophy's machinations. Of course, nothing would work out as perfectly in real life, but I'll suspend my disbelief lang enough to believe she really kept all those strings untangled and created the best for everyone involved. And you do see the end coming a mile away. But it's still lovely. I am side-eyeing the first cousin romance though. Just saying. "

Even taking into account several years when I didn't own a copy of it, I'm still up at triple digits for this book, and I never tire of it. Sophy is a lady whom I understand very well. She is determined to shape the lives around her into a more harmonious form, and goes about this delightfully, leaving her ""victims"" staring bemusedly behind her, happier than they were, but SO confused by it all!

I loved the whole family dinamic and how the characters were developed. I thought it was great how the story does not feel obvious and how we don't exactly know how everything is going to end. However, I did feel that the way this book was written didn't make the reader feel close to the story and the characters, putting a distance that sometimes got in the way of the story.

While it started off fun (in the way that someone writing in the 20th century about life in the 19th century can be fun), Heyer took a disappointing turn. She decided to have a very anti-semitic portrayal of a moneylender. It must have been all in the name of accuracy to the times--who knows. But, it felt like she must have enjoyed writing this, under the guise of someone ""just trying to be accurate"". I returned the book to Amazon."

266,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/116941467-evelin,Rating 4 out of 5,"Amióta megnéztem a Bridgerton sorozat második évadát újra történelmi romantikus lázban égek. Emiatt természetes volt, hogy el fogom olvasni azt a könyvet, aminek már a fülszövegében is benne van, hogy a sorozat rajongói ne hagyják ki, és tényleg ne, mert Sophy személye felbolygatja a világot és romokat hagy maga után. Eloise biztosan rajongana és felnézne rá, s már emiatt is különleges A híres Sophy, hiszen Eloise Beidgerton csak kevés nőre néz fel igazán. Úgy éreztem olvasás közben, hogy belecsöppentem egy olyan történetbe, ahol a káosz és a szeleburdiság kéz a kézben együtt jár, de minden egyes sorát imádtam. Sophy hihetetlen egy karakter, és alapjaiban határozza meg a kötet cselekményét a jelenléte. Nem az a szokványos történelmi romantikus, amihez szokva vagyunk, de minden egyes sorával szerethető.A híres Sophy egy felettébb szórakoztató, romantikus, vicces jelenetekben gazdag karakter vezette történet. Ez az első Heyer regényem, de már itt átjött az a stílus és könnyedség, amivel a szerző megörvendeztetett minket. Tökéletes kikapcsolódást nyújtó, bekuckózós olvasmány, aminél megszűnik körülöttünk a külvilág zaja, és mi is visszacsöppenünk 1950-be, amikor is a történet íródott. Heyer a maga komikus, briliáns stílusával igazi régimódi történetet tár elénk, ahol a nőies vonalak, a habos-babos máz, és a világ eszméi csapnak össze. Már az első fejezet után tudtam, hogy szeretni fogom, s habár nem olyan légies a stílusa, mint egy Julia Quinn regénynek, a történelmi romantikusok kedvelői nagyon fogják szeretni. Sophy egy igazi üde színfoltja a műfajnak a maga könnyed, és drámai személyiségével. Nemcsak kedvelhető, vagy éppen bosszantóbbnál bosszantóbb karakterek tűnnek fel, hanem a szerző azt is megmutatja, hogy milyen az, ha valami nem a forgatókönyv, az elvárások. és az akkori normák szerint történik. Sophy minden szabályt felrúg, nem az az engedékeny hölgy, akit irányítani lehet, hanem egy igazi úttörő, akinek megvan mindenről és mindenkiről a véleménye, és nem fél bepiszkítani a kezét sem. Erős, ugyanakkor cserfes és cselszövésekkel teli élete az utolsó sorokig szórakoztat és elragad.Ha azt mondom, hogy imádtam olvasni, akkor az nem fejezi ki eléggé, hogy mekkora kedvenc is lett. Bevallom az első fejezet annyira nem ragadott meg, de miután Sophy feltűnt a színen nem tudtam ellenállni, és eltűntem a történelmi romantikus aknamező végtelenjében. Már maga a fülszöveg is sejteti, hogy bizony egy nem mindennapi történettel van dolgunk, és ennél nem is lehetne jobban jellemezni, minthogy A híres Sophy nemcsak a társadalmi normákat vágja sutba, hanem a kor ideáljait is megtagadja. Nemcsak szórakoztat, de nevetésre is késztet. Nem győztem mosolyogni, és alig vártam, hogy egyre többet és többet tudjak meg a történetből.A karakterek sokszínűsége mellett, a gondolkodásmód, a cselszövések és a pártalálás, mások életébe való beavatkozás kerül előtérbe, s éppen emiatt lesz oly komikus, s oly szerethető ez a regény. Lehetne polgár pukkasztónak is tituálni a regényt, és a maga korában az is lenne, de nem a mai világban. Előre haladást, szellemességet és fejlődőképességet mutat. Megmutatja, hogy nem minden a báj, s sokszor elég a megfelelő szavakat elérni, hogy célba érjünk. Nem titok, hogy Sophy nem a szépségéről híres, ugyanakkor a szellemessége és az a természetesség, ami körüllengi palástolja a gyengeségeit.Heyer egy olyan történetet tár elénk, ahol a hősnő erős, szembe megy a normákkal, és nem fél férfiak által elvárt feladatokkal kikapcsolni magát. Ha őszinte akarok lenni, sokkal közelebb tudtam érezni magamhoz, mint pl. Miss Wraxtont, aki hiába követi az elvárt viselkedést, mégis szörnyen unalmas karakternek találtam. Valahol családregény is, hiszen Sophy mellett Rivenhallék is hatalmas szerepet kapnak, és az ő életükbe is betekintést nyerhetünk.Maga a cselekmény hamisíthatatlanul élénk és szórakoztató, ugyanakkor néhol melankólikus is, és nagyon angol. Lefesti mindazt, amitől egy történelmi romantikus azzá válik, ami, miközben sorra hozza a szórakoztatóbbnál szórakoztatóbb jeleneteket. Örültem, hogy nem egy újabb regency romance került a kezeim közé, amiben nincs egyediség, mert elég sok minden elmondható A híres Sophy-ról, de az nem, hogy követné a szabályokat, és kiszámítható lenne. Sophy egy igazán intelligens, kicsit őrült nőszemély, akinek mindig van valami a tarsolyában.Mindemellett úszik a problémákban, a megoldandó helyzeteben, s nem egy helyen szövevényes, mégis kalandos, és felettébb gáláns regény. Egy percre sem unalmas, de igaz, hogy helyenként lassú, így ha még nem olvastál az írótól és érdekel, hogy egyáltalán neked való e a stílusa, akkor mindenképp ezzel kezd, mert ad egy átfogóbb képet arról, hogy mit is várj el Heyertől, és a munkásságától. Örülök, hogy ez lett az első regényem tőle, hiszen Sophy különleges, ami kiemeli a kor hölgyei közül. Úgy gondolom, hogy veszíteni semmiképp sem veszíthet az ember, ha megismeri A híres Sophy történetét, hiszen épít, gondolkodóba ejt, és nem utolsó sorban minden elvárásodat ledönti."
267,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1444762-jill,Rating 4 out of 5,"This delightful romantic comedy set in Regency England has an unforgettable heroine in effervescent 20-year-old Sophy Stanton-Lacy, who comes to stay with her aunt, Lady Ombersley, while her father, Sir Horace, goes on a trip to South America. Sir Horace asks his sister not only to take in Sophy while he is gone, but to work on finding her a husband. Sir Horace would like to marry Sancia, the Marquesa de Villacanas, but Sancia has no desire to be a stepmother.Sir Horace also contends that Sophy will make a good companion for his sister’s daughter, 19-year-old Cecelia. Cecelia is in want of guidance, Lady Ombersley allows, since Lord Charlbury has asked for Cecelia’s hand in what would be a respectable match, but she is in love with an unemployed airhead and would-be poet, Augustus Fawnhope.Running the household is not the husband of Lady Ombersley but her oldest son Charles, 26, who is, at any rate, the oldest responsible male, and who inherited the fortune of his great uncle. Since the frivolous senior Ombersley managed to get their whole estate encumbered, it is Charles who now manages the estate, and “who calls the tune.” Charles has the whole family on sort of a frivolity lockdown, in part because of his sobering assessment of their finances, and in part because of the influence of his fiancee, Eugenia Wraxton, a horrid person no one else but Charles likes very much.After Sophy arrives, with her greyhound Tina; a parrot and monkey for the younger children; and her vicacity, enthusiasm, and refusal to act like a “proper” female, the house is in an uproar, but in a good way (except in the opinion of Eugenia). Further, Sophy observes to Cecilia: “Everything you have told me shows me that you are fallen, all of you, into a shocking state of melancholy!” And Sophy intends to do something about it.She sets out to put everyone’s relationships to right in a very amusing series of escapades that show why so many acquaintances have dubbed her ""The Grand Sophy."" For Eugenia, Sophy contrives a scheme that I can’t believe wasn’t part of the inspiration for “The Parent Trap.” And for the others, Sophy - with courage, compassion, and cleverness - devises resolutions that are quite in line with the comedic antics of Shakespeare.In the end, all is well that ends well, and it ends very well indeed.Evaluation: The skewered society airs and preoccupations of the wealthy are set in stark relief to Sophy’s irresistible exuberance, lack of pretention, and insistence that women can and should be able to do what they want. The dialogue is fast and witty, and although this is a romcom rather than a thriller, it’s hard to put down for wanting to know how these schemes of Sophy’s will turn out.The only regrettable aspect of the book to me was a rather shocking lapse into vicious antisemitism by the author. Aside from that brief inclusion in the book, it will remind you of the madcap movies that paired Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant, or Clark Gable and Carole Lombard. The ending, while certainly chaste enough in the style of Regency romances, is not only hilarious, but veritably pulses with sexual tension and the promise of romantic passion."
268,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/87835420-abigail,Rating 3 out of 5,"When the lively, loving and very independent Miss Sophia Stanton-Lacy comes to stay with her relatives in Berkeley Square, none of the Rivenhall family, from nervous Lady Ombersley to stern Cousin Charles, have any notion that their lives will never be the same. Soon perceiving that she has come to an unhappy home, Sophy determines that she will set all to rights, whether this entails assisting Hubert with his financial difficulties, helping beautiful Cecilia to find her true love, nursing young Amabel back to health, or disentangling Charles from his obnoxious fiancée.One of Heyer's most charming Regency Romances, The Grand Sophy features an appealing and admirable heroine, whose sangfroid in the face of her Cousin Charles's frequent expressions of outrage is hilarious to observe. This well-written story might, in fact, have ranked among my favorite Heyer novels, had my pleasure in it not been diminished by the unfortunate inclusion of a very ugly and anti-Semitic scene, midway through the book.I am referring, of course, to the passage concerning the Jewish moneylender, to be found in the eleventh chapter of the book. I have had occasion before this, to feel somewhat uncomfortable with the throwaway comments made in some of Ms. Heyer's novels about ""going to the Jews"" (frequenting moneylenders), but have always believed them to indicate a broad-based cultural anti-Semitism that would have been current during the time depicted, rather than outright authorial prejudice.Such cannot be said in this case however, as Mr. Goldhanger's depiction has clear racial overtones. Described as having ""long greasy curls, a semitic nose, and an ingratiating leer,"" his villainous behavior is attributed, not to his profession or personal character, but to his ""race."" Heyer never actually says he's a villain BECAUSE he's a Jew, but her remarks about the ""the instinct of his race"" make it plain that such is her implication.This is a very short passage in an otherwise outstanding novel, and I would not argue that it ruins the book. But reading it left such a nasty taste in my mouth, that it could not be entirely forgotten either. Truly, a sad blemish on Georgette Heyer's name."
269,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14037242-girl-with-her-head-in-a-book,Rating 4 out of 5,"For my full review: http://girlwithherheadinabook.co.uk/2...I've been guilty of judging Georgette Heyer by her book covers for years - my childhood hatred for romantic plot-lines blossomed into an automatic self-censorship - if I think that the heroine is at any point likely to turn around and realise that 'love was there all along', I skate on by to the other end of the bookshelf. However, enough fellow bloggers have raved about how much fun they have had with books by Georgette Heyer that I started to think that I just might be missing out on something here and so I decided to do some research of my own and ... it turns out that I most certainly was. The Grand Sophy was truly the most delightful surprise.The titular Grand Sophy is Sophia Stanton Lacy, only daughter of Sir Horace Stanton-Lacy, long-time international diplomat. Following the Napoleonic Wars, he finds himself sent off on a posting to South America and decides, if it isn't too much trouble, it would be easiest to drop 'little Sophy' off with his sister's family rather than take her along with him as he usually would and if they can find the time, it would also be helpful if they could find the young girl a husband while they're about it. Sophy's aunt is expecting a timid young waif but instead, along comes a confident young woman who is five foot nine and well used to getting her own way, having grown up with no mother, governess and having spent most of her life on the Continent to boot.Sophy's cousin Charles is particularly appalled by the new arrival. He has wrest control of the family from his financially imprudent father, thanks to a recent inheritance and has no intention of letting Sophy get things out of order again. Given that the dreaded cousin brings with her a dog and a monkey, his fears are quickly realised. Bringing out Charles' worst side is his ghastly fiance Eugenia, a pedantic bluestocking who would be his wife already if she had not been forced to go into morning. In the background, Charles' sister Cecilia is working herself into hysterics because her family refuse to give her permission to marry the feather-brained poet she so admires and insist that she wed the wealthy young lord who is so decidedly unromantic that he has actually fallen victim to the mumps.In terms of the dynamics of the novel, I was pleasantly reminded of Cold Comfort Farm - Flora Poste would surely have approved of Sophy's brisk analysis of the situation and calm determination to set things right. I would say that Sophy had a lesser disdain for her relatives, thinking less of 'The Higher Common Sense' and more of what would actually make them happy. Indeed, with Charles and Sophy set against each other from a very early stage, it is very clear that this is more of a romantic comedy than Cold Comfort Farm ever was. Still, I enjoyed Sophy's cool consideration of who would best suit her cousin Cecilia as a husband based on life's practicalities - who would get the best table in a restaurant or be able to source an umbrella promptly in the case of rain. To be honest, these may seem the small things, but Sophy appears to recognise that life itself is made up of such moments.Another cousin-in-trouble was young Hubert, who was sweet with the children but foolish with his own resources and had managed to fall prey to a money-lender. As with the rest of his family, Sophy set about righting his situation, but when I read up on the novel, thanks to my new-found admiration for Georgette Heyer, I was unsettled to discover that in the original draft, the passage describing Sophy's confrontation with the money-lender included a rather vitriolic anti-Semitic passage which has been excised from newer editions. Sophy herself never appeared to have prejudices - when Cecilia remarks how strange it is to see her kiss her maid, the woman who has raised her since infancy, the Grand Sophy responds tartly in her own defence. Similarly, when Eugenia - oh-so-sweetly - implies to Sophy that her manner may lead others to suppose that she is fast, our heroine is once again speedy to take action. She has little truck with the demands of etiquette and prefers sincerity and generousity. I had no issue with the idea of Sophy taking steps to defend the foolish Hubert, but imagining her to dislike the money-lender on the basis of his race or faith rather than due to his professional dealings felt very out of step with the rest of the novel and deeply unsavoury.I know it was a different time, but I still believe that people had consciences and given that the novel was written post-World War Two, I still think that these views are inexcusable. I don't know - there are racist passages within Gone With The Wind, but while these do catch the modern reader off guard, it is also an interesting book in terms of how Mitchell implicitly demonstrates the ugliness within plantation life, how the slave-owners foundered once their slaves went free and indeed the general complexity of the whole situation. It's not perfect, but I think that Mitchell addresses the climate more, while with The Grand Sophy, I was ready to write an enthusiastic review about how fun the book had been, but was suddenly thrown to realise that so much offence had been caused. I guess though the question of how we respond to racism in fiction would be the topic for a discussion post all on its own.What should be clear here is that Georgette Heyer is a witty and engaging writer. I came to the book very unsure about whether or not I would like it and was ready not to finish, but instead I came bounding to the end, rather miffed that there was not more left. There were a good deal more high-jinks and general shenanigans than one would ever get in an Austen novel but yet still, The Grand Sophy appealed to the same part of me that enjoys all the general bonnet- related antics of Aunt Jane. There may be slightly less of the truths of the human heart, but there are all of the aesthetics. I think that Sophy would have very kindly taken several of Austen's heroines in hand (although Miss Bingley would probably have come to a slightly sticky end and I dread to think what might have befallen Mrs Elton's basket with the pink ribbon) and generally attempted to smooth their paths - although her rule-breaking may be slightly anachronistic, I still couldn't help but warm to her. While she may lack the delicacy of Eugenia, Sophy has more of manners in the truest meaning of the term and for all those who raise their eyebrows at her behaviour, her heart is pure and she is quite determined to see things turn out right for all. I was disappointed to discover that this is the last of Sophy's adventures, particularly since I doubt that she would let matrimony (spoiler alert!) slow her down but was fascinated to discover a writer who was entirely different to what I had supposed. The most exciting news is that apparently there's a film in the works ..."

Der Plot war flott und unterhaltsam, es ist im wesentlichen eine beinah Shakespearische Liebeskomödie. Zwei Kritikpunkte muss ich aber los werden. 1.) Antisemitismus. Es ist nur eine Szene von 4-5 Seiten, aber der Besuch bei dem schmierigen, erpresserischen, jüdischen Pfandleiher geht gar nicht und ist schlimmster Antisemitismus. Wäre das Buch zeitgenössisch hätte ich dafür ja noch irgendwie Verständnis, aber Georgette Heyer hat es 1950 geschrieben, als der Holocaust und die Verbrechen gegen die Juden schon breit bekannt waren. Da hätte ich mehr von ihr erwartet. 2.) Ich bin vermutlich in der absoluten Minderheit, aber ich bin mit Sophy einfach nicht warm geworden. Sie hat ihre Momente ... aber Gott, sie ist so anstrengend. Sie mischt sich ständig in alles ungefragt ein, drückt anderen ihre Lebensphilosophie auf, zieht sie in ihre Shenanigangs mit herein und wird dafür niemals gerügt sondern steht immer als Heldin des Tages da. Man kann so eine überbordernde, selbstgerechte Heldin toll schreiben und sie trotzdem sympathisch machen - z.b. Jane Austens Emma Woodhouse ist auch so eine Kandidatin. Aber Emma bekommt im Narrativ ordentlich kontra geboten und fliegt mit ihrer Einmischung ganz schön auf die Nase. Aber Sophy nie. jeder liebt sie. Alle ihre Pläne gelingen. Sie kann alles, sie weiß alles, sie kennt jeden. Irgendwie war es schwer für mich mit ihr mitzufiebern, weil schon nach zwanzig Seiten klar war, dass ihr sowieso alles gelingen würde. Ehrlich gesagt hatte ich irgendwann vollstes Verständnis und geballte Sympathie für Charles Verlobte, die sie ja auch nicht leiden kann (aber deswegen auch ein grässlicher Mensch sein muss -das Narrativ ist nämlich 100% pro Sophy). Trotzdem war die Story sehr unterhaltsam und Charles, Cecily und die anderen Charaktere mochte ich sehr gerne. "

One of the best things about her mysteries, is her wonderful ability to create dialog. And that is one of the best things about this book as well.Sophia (Sophy) has lived with her father all over Europe. He is a diplomat and she has learned how to deal with people. She has learned about human nature and how to deal with the humans who have any nature.Her father has gone away and left her with his sister and her family. And it is quite a family. There are parents, grown children and young children. Sophy has introduced a pet monkey to the nursery….and it is for the children to enjoy. Sophy immediately has seen what needs to be done and she does everything in her power to get things in order. She is a managing woman. And she has “the guts of a burglar”. Everything she does, she does it in order to make lives better. Actually, some of the things she does are simply done because she wants the fun. This book has humor and charm. Ms Heyer was a remarkable author who created characters who hold the reader’s interest from the first chapter to the last.There are things in this story which are evidence of a different time and place. But, if the reader can put things in perspective, those events and descriptions are not enough to ruin the story.I am glad Ms Heyer was a prolific author, ‘cause I have quite a few more books to read."

The writing style - one needs to get used to, I often have to read twice to understand what was meant, people ""ejaculating"" when they are speaking excited is just not in my English word repertoire ;) Thankfully there is kindle, where most words can be found in a dictionary literally at ones finger tip. A dysfunctional family takes their niece/cousin in while her father is abroad. The young lady turns out to be far from the easy going girl the family expected, but a lady that does not follow conventions and has not one helpless bone in her. Soon she starts to meddle with family affairs to help everybody find happiness.There was no romance whatsoever, no pages of how the female protagonist thinks how great the male protagonist is and vice versa. But there was outrageous funny banter, lots of little adventures, a very likeable heroine, interesting side characters and at the end, of course, everybody found their partner to love. The very end was a bit ... dry. ""Will you marry me?"" ""Yes."" *hm* If I would not have known from the blurb where this story was heading I would have asked myself: ""Why these two? Did I miss something where they fell in love?""However, I was thoroughly enjoying the book, which earns it 5 stars."

In Sophy, the author has created an unforgettable character.Sophia has been raised by her ambassador father after the death of her mother, accompanying him all over the world, and has become quite a character. She is bidden to stay with her aunt's family in London while her father makes a trip to Brazil - he is hoping she will find a husband while she is there, leaving him free to marry again, as the woman he fancies does not want to be a stepmother. Sophy enters a household tyrannized over by her cousin, the eldest son, who has inherited a fortune from an uncle and taken over the running of his parents' estate from his father's poor management. He is engaged to a dour lady whose wish it is to help him manage his estate and his family. But Sophy is a manager extraordinaire - she manages people who don't necessarily realize they are being managed, and she does so in a fascinating and humorous way. This becomes almost a comedy of errors as she manages her relatives and their friends and lovers into a tremendous coil, which only gets resolved on the next to last page. It will keep you engaged and laughing, and loving Sophy as her family learns to."

Chaos promptly ensues. “Little Sophy” is a hurricane force: charismatic, unconventional, fun, exciting, and completely the master of every social circumstance. Hilarity follows in her footsteps as she sets everyone to dancing and immediately begins to arrange all romantic circumstances and personal problems to what she deems most beneficial to the persons concerned - to the eminent exasperation of her cousin Charles especially. Of course sparks fly.This setup is a trope, but Heyer succeeds marvelously. Think Emma, only flawlessly executed and without an iota of selfishness - Sophy absolutely means well and accomplishes it all. I laughed out loud multiple times. This book is a lightly engaging romance in the old style (not a hint of bodice ripping), with great characters. Sophy is one of my new favorite heroines: she reads as perfectly of her time, but absolutely hilarious, unconventional, and an amazing strong female character. Note: This book contains a scene with strong anti-Semitic overtones in characterization. While this book was published in 1950, its time does not excuse the theme or the author’s prejudice."

Sophy is intelligent, feisty, confident & not afraid to meddle. Charles is so stern & upright, sparks fly when the two of them are together. It’s another favourite of mine & I loved the dynamics between the characters. Sophy soon has everyone jumping to her tune & even Charles succumbs. I just love it.

It was hilarious, somewhat unconventional, and extremely satisfying at the ending. I’ve read some books with characters that are similar to Sophy (the main character), who is bold, frank, and a force to be reckoned with, but who make mistakes and end up in a worse situation from where they began. Sophy, on the other hand, knows what she wants, goes after it, and almost always ends up with the results she wants, if not better than she expected. But her path to the desired outcome is often invokes shock and awe from those around her. Is the plot somewhat improbable? Yes, but that’s what makes it such a fun read. It’s a Regency novel, and I’m glad I’ve read enough in and about that time period to understand the ins and outs of the society. A friend recommended Georgette Heyer to me as an author for someone who loves Jane Austen, and I can’t wait to read more! "

As I have found consistent with Heyer's plots, the denouement was particularly hilarious. The convergence, the comeuppance, the scheming, the ducklings—!(No, seriously. The ducklings. I'm half persuaded that Heyer, in the midst of writing the conclusion, sat back and thought to herself, ""How can I make this situation even more ridiculous?"" And her muse whispered, ""Ducklings."" With a cackle, she bent to her pen again and composed the last, glorious chapter, complete with totally gratuitous and beautifully incongruous ducklings.)What I would give to see this book enacted on stage!"

I am feeling pretty rough today, having gotten a mere three hours of sleep last night. I absolutely could not put this book down. I tossed and turned, wondering what would happen the night of the ball. The dialogue! The characters! The dialogue! The humor! The dialogue!Obviously, I'm going to be eating up the entire Georgette Heyer catalog. I remember making a note about this book, I'm pretty sure from the Book Lust series. It was also mentioned in the LEP group, as February was romance month. I will keep this review short, because dragging myself through a day impairs my ability to be eloquent, but I can say emphatically that I do not regret for a moment any lost sleep while in the process of reading this book.

She’s right up there with Emily Fox-Seaton in “The Making of a Marchioness”—they’re both spirited, capable, and brilliant, and whatever they lack in conventional beauty they make up for it by just being awesome and kind. Such a great message! I have to give 4 rather than 5 stars because, like the racist depiction of the Ayah in The Making of a Marchioness, this book has some super uncomfortable racist depictions of a Spanish woman and a Jewish moneylender. The Marquesa is a comedy device, and the moneylender adds drama, but both are terribly racist and stereotypical. It was written in the 1950s, so it doesn’t carry the time period excuses that The Making of a Marchioness can use. IIRC, similarly great heroines can be found in Venetia and Frederica, without the added racism."

Sir Horace asks his sister, Lady Ombersley, to watch over Sophy and help find her a husband.Sophy is quite a brave, brazen character with wit and style, who has the ability to manipulate people which result in good outcomes!An enjoyable light read.

Troede ærlig talt at jeg ville syntes den var frygtelig! Men men MEN! Det viste sig at være lige modsat. Jeg var umådelig godt underholdt hele vejen igennem, selvom plottet (hvis der kan siges at være et) er forudsigeligt og du ved fra starten af hvordan det hele ender med fin sløjfe omkring - men det gør virkelig ikke noget. Når det er hvad man forventer, så lever den kun op til det. Der er et stort karaktergalleri, men de er hver og én så godt udpenslet at du aldrig liiige skal tænke tilbage for at huske hvem der er hvem. Man kan ikke andet end at holde med dem alle sammen, selv de mest irriterende af karaktererne - og det er sgu meget godt klaret. Jeg er vild med at bogen er skrevet for så mange år siden, for det viser bare at nogle ting altid vil være aktuelle og ræsonnere med mennesker. Vil helt sikkert læse mere af den kære Georgette Heyer.

I rarely read classic romance, but after this I'll have to seek out more. I am easily stressed by awkward situations and misunderstandings, but Heyer manages to make Sophy very funny from beginning to end without ever making me uncomfortable. I enjoyed the romance elements, but by far my favorite aspect of this book was the characters. It is packed full of interesting characters, and I could have spent more time with every single one of them (even those I disliked). That said, Sophy herself is obviously the standout, and I loved every minute I spent with her."

She's also the original Manic Pixie Dream Girl: she manages her own money, plans excellent parties, is a solid whip, buys her own horses, and if she knew how to fence and box she'd probably good that those activities as well. She has everyone's measure right from the start. I love Heyer's dialogue more than anything - no one writes like that.

By the time I reached the middle of the book, I found it difficult to put down. I loved the variety of characters and personalities. It was easy to guess the ending, but very entertaining to see how it all came together. Good humor. There was periodic swearing throughout, though. I do have to say that it had the most memorable proposal: ""Will you marry me, vile and abominable girl that you are?"" It was quite touching..."

Sophy has been left at her aunt's by her diplomat father and she immediately starts to solve their problems. As one review said, Sophy is a very alpha character, used to kindly ensuring everyone is happy and fullfilled. I liked the way the hardened soldiers that were her friends understood her. I was a bit surprised that she should have ended up married to her first cousin but then aristocracy have always been a little odd. Eloisa James in her guise as a shakespearing scholar explained the original reference and the current editing that had taken place over the money lender passage and I agree it has been well done. Leaving the bones of the story without the original unneccessarily anti semetic over tones. I voluntarily read and reviewed an advanced copy of this book. All thoughts and opinions are my own."

Unfortunately, it took me quite a while to warm up to our cheeky heroine, Sophy. However, the story was well written and I ended up loving it towards the end, especially how all the characters in the story were brought together in one infamous resolution. I'm curious if it was just that I was busy when I started the book and that may have kept me from getting invested in the story more or if this one is just more of a slow build up. The whole premise of a family that loves each other, but has lost their way, being brought round when a mischievous young girl is dropped in their laps definitely proves to be a fun one."

Sometimes you just need to visit with an old friend. The reason for the latest was listening to an audio book while I knit and realizing it was abridged. So I had to get back in touch with the whole book. 
293,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1744269-susan,Rating 5 out of 5,"A Georgette Heyer romance is the best the romance genre can offer. Far before the days of idealized relationships starting off as drunken one night stands, or whirlwind affairs that prove that love is true after about a week, Georgette Heyer wrote romances of sensible people enjoying life and realizing that they enjoy it more with their exasperating friend. Even though a Heyer romance can be relied on to have a happy ending to the romance and some combination of her favorite adventuring subplots, the characters have unique personalities that not only keep Heyer's later romances from feeling like retreads of the earliest ones, but make some of them actually more compelling. The Grand Sophy is one of Heyer's best romances, as it is difficult not to be charmed by its heroine, Sophia Stanton-Lacy, or the affairs that she tangles.Having been on the Continent as her father's hostess during the military campaign against Napoleon, confident Sophy Stanton-Lacy converses easily with officers and gentlemen, rides and drives with the best of sportsmen, handles her own finances, and is ready to solve any problem that comes her way. When we meet Sophy, she is visiting her aunt and cousins in London presumably to look for a husband in order to let her father remarry without household awkwardness. Sophy never really thinks about this presumed purpose, even as all of her family thinks of it for her. Instead, Sophy is very worried about her staid cousin, Charles, and his even more uptight fiancee, who together will make everyone in her aunt's family miserable. In fact, Charles has already been making everyone upset by his economizing to reduce his father's gaming debts, and by strongly encouraging his sister to marry a respectable gentleman. Sophy at once realizes that 1) Charles has no tact, 2) the respectable gentleman is worth getting into the family, and 3) the rest of Charles' family hasn't the sense to help Charles in his efforts, leading to 4) Charles will only become more authoritarian if he marries that fiancee. So Sophy plans a domestic campaign of sabotaging Charles' engagement and cementing his sister's interest in the respectable gentleman. With a score of supporting characters (some of whom I couldn't even keep track of) and roughly 7 sets of engaged and disengaged couples, plenty of things happen to make Sophy and Charles realize how much they understand and respect each other.Georgette Heyer is frequently compared to Jane Austen because of the setting of parlors and ballrooms during the early nineteenth century and because talking and manners are more important to the characters than kissing. These reasons for the comparison are somewhat unfair to Heyer, however, because they suggest that Heyer is failing to live up to Austen's standard when her characters go chasing across the English or French countryside, or when they fire pistols, or when they take some liberties with proper behavior to ride on an sporting carriage or break an engagement. A more apt comparison is to Shakespeare, I think. Heyer's characterization, mistaken pairings and climactic scenes with half the cast meeting to resolve the confusion are all elements of Shakespearian comedies, and are arguably better done in The Grand Sophy than in many of those comedies. Heyer, like Shakespeare, sets her stories in an idealized historical time period, and mixes in enough researched material that you are utterly convinced that her world existed at some time. Just as it would be difficult to convince people that Julius Caesar might not have said, ""Et tu, Brute?"" it would be hard to imagine after reading a few Heyer novels that English gentry and nobles didn't exclaim, ""Do stop making such a cake of yourself!"" The greatest skill Heyer demonstrates in her books, along with strong characterization, is a sense of flawless romantic pacing. Typically the first hundred or so pages are meant to establish independent characters for the hero and heroine as well as somewhat convoluted subplots (the pages also serve to get you used to Heyer's long chatty sentences before you need to focus on the minutiae of glances between the couple, and other such romantic things). Then there follows a series of encounters between the hero and the heroine, establishing how perfectly suited they are to each other (they usually agree that some younger lady is foolish and they are far more mature), as well as the solving of all of the subplot problems. Finally, every Heyer romance ends within a few pages (generally on the exact page) of the hero and heroine finally getting their relationship in order and sealing it with a happy kiss. As much as the characters usually fail to focus on their own romance, preferring to solve everyone else's gaming debts or unsuitable romances, Heyer knows that the climax is never the climax of the subplot. The climax is always appropriately that moment of romantic understanding. As much as it's easy to brush off genre romances as fluffy silly books, rereading The Grand Sophy reminded me that it's only easy to do that when the book is poorly written. Georgette Heyer though, unlike all of her modern imitators, is always a devilish good read."

The only detractors were the stereotyped Jewish moneylender character, and the very last scene, where an abusive dynamic is passed off as love. But it wasn't like that the whole way through.

306,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,This was a delightful entertaining regency novel. Very well written. It’s a mix of P.G. Wodehouse (Wooster and Jeeves) with Emma! The dialog takes a bit of concentration but it’s hilarious! I had a hard time putting it down.

314,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/169504-caro,Rating 4 out of 5,"It's been decades since I've read Heyer, but this book reminded me of how good she can be. Sophy appears on her aunt's doorstep and immediately sums up the situation: everyone is in love with the wrong person, but she can fix it. And she does, not without wild carriage rides, fiery arguments, a sleepy Spanish lady, a gormless poet, and a clutch of ducklings. Plus, all ends happily, just as you knew it would. This would make a great film! (Nora Ephron, where are you when we need you?) Oh, and thanks to The Idle Woman for the recommendation."
315,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"Probably one of the best romance heroines ever written. I was amazed at how fantastically Sophie manages to be both a woman of her time and bold, adventurous and deeply caring. The secondary characters- her cousins the Rivenalls and their assorted problems made the plot even more compelling. The only piece that was a bit of a sad cliche to read was the portrayal of a Jewish moneylender. Reading it today, it was cringeworthily antisemitic. The book could have used an epilogue but was probably about the same as a Jane Austen book in lacking one and ending a little abruptly. "
316,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1859502-michelle,Rating 4 out of 5,"This was my first Heyer, and I enjoyed it immensely. Fictional proposals just aren't going to hit the same after, 'Will you marry me, vile and abominable girl that you are?’"
317,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10562191-lois,Rating 4 out of 5,Guilty pleasureA charming book that one can’t help but enjoy! It’s no Jane Austen but it’s a good clean romantic comedy. 
318,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"4.5 rounded up! Oh my goodness! I had to keep going back a minute or two because I was laughing heartily in the last hour of this book! Sophy is just too much, and you can’t help but love her. The beginning of the book was a bit slow for me, maybe I was getting used to the narrator or there were too many characters, but once I got going it was too much fun!"
319,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54717607-littlesophie,Rating 3 out of 5,"This reads like Austen's Emma, if she had a more daring older sister. Enjoyable and feisty, with a wonderfully ridiculous character constellation, it was mostly the undeniable antisemitism that made my wary of this one. Not one of her best, therefore."
320,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10931333-randi,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is a delightful read. Light and fun, the exact thing I was looking for. It feels like a cross between Wodehouse and Austen."

I've read The Grand Sophy many times before (and own two different editions, I believe), but I picked up this advance copy because I was curious to know whether ""updates for the modern reader"" might mean they'd edited out the antisemitism. I can report back that the moneylender scene is still in the book (it would be difficult to resolve the Hubert subplot without it) but the really egregious descriptions of Goldhangar have been cut. Eloisa James/Mary Bly directly addresses the edits in the afterword, which I thought was the appropriate way to handle it. Having addressed that elephant in the room: there's a reason this book is so enduringly popular! I can never pick it up without being compelled to read all the way to the end, no matter what else I'm reading at the same time. As Eloisa James notes in her foreword, it's the ultimate alpha4alpha romance, and a delight to watch Sophy steamroll straight over every obstacle in her path. "
322,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20572001-bobbiann-markle,Rating 5 out of 5,"What a delicious book! It was funny, interesting, and thoroughly delightful—the most enjoyable novel I’ve read in ages. Sophy is so much fun; she ignores the proper, ladylike customs of her Regency era when it suits her, yet never makes herself ridiculous. Her father, Sir Horace, leaves her with his sister’s family in London while he goes off to Brazil. Cousin Cecilia wants to marry a poet instead of the older gentleman her father wishes for her, and cousin Charles is engaged to a boring, meddlesome woman. Sophy constantly infuriates Charles, but somehow everything she does improves relationships and makes everyone happier in the end."

325,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2250598-gwen-the-gwendolyn-reading-method,Rating 3 out of 5,"The good: brilliant characters. I LOOOOOVE Sophy. She's a sassy heroine who is also *gasp* SMART. And I'm always a sucker for grumpy, but secretly good-natured leading men. The eh????: this book was from an age where marrying your cousin wasn't quite so icky as it is now. So be prepared to have to try to ignore that.The really, really bad: the offhand casual old-school anti-semitism is reallly not ok."
326,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4822597-kate-mcmurry,Rating 5 out of 5,"Fabulous, G-rated, Regency comedy of errors!Sophy is the 20-year-old daughter of the enormously wealthy, distinguished diplomat, Sir Horace Stanton-Lacy. He has been widowed since Sophy was very young, but he has brought her with him everywhere he has been assigned, on behalf of England, all across the continent, during her entire childhood and early adulthood. Through her father, she has been intimately connected, since infancy, with every leader in government and among ton society, including the royal princes. In addition to highly polished, aristocratic social skills, Sir Horace has taught Sophy to ride a mettlesome stallion, drive a carriage, and fire a pistol with a consummate skill that few men can match. She has also been his hostess and organized elite balls on his behalf since she was 17. She dresses in the highest kick of Parisian fashion, which sets off her magnificent hourglass figure to perfection. Her face is arrestingly attractive, though, by her own unconcerned admission, she is not a beauty. She also stands 5'9"" in her stocking feet, which is tall for a man in the Regency era, and gigantic for a woman. Sophy is charismatic, quick-witted, and a keen observer of the emotions and physical needs of the people around her. She can never bear to see anyone suffering difficulties without doing her best to assist them. Her personal motto is: ""Nothing could be more fatal in any predicament...than to have fallen into a fit of despondency.... It encourages one to suppose that there is nothing to be done, when a little resolution is all that is wanted to bring matters to a happy conclusion."" But the way that Sophy, in this fabulous, ""comedy of errors"" plot, resolves the problems of the people around her is by cleverly maneuvering them to make choices that are in their best interests, which are all her own idea, but which she deviously, ultimately, convinces them is something they thought of themselves, in order to protect their pride. There are only a few people in this novel who see right through her: her father, her cousin Charles, and some of the officers whom she knew on the continent, who personally witnessed some of her helpful hijinks.At the start of this story, 45-year-old Sir Horace requests that his 50-year-old sister, Elizabeth (Lizzie) Rivenhall, Lady Ombersley, allow Sophy to stay with her, her 60-year-old spouse, Lord Ombersley, and seven of her eight children in their Berkeley Square mansion. He wishes his sister to sponsor Sophy during the upcoming London season, where she hopes to contract an eligible alliance, while he is on diplomatic assignment in South America for several months. None of her relatives have seen Sophy since she was a child, and all of Aunt Lizzie's offspring, except staid, disapproving, 26-year-old Charles, are ecstatically surprised when Sophy arrives on their doorstep in a chaise and four, with two outriders and a middle-aged groom leading a splendid black stallion. The youngest children and their governess race to greet her, and Sophy instantly earns their undying affection by presenting them with a talking parrot and a monkey, and allowing them to pet her tiny, frisky, Italian greyhound. It does not take Sophy very long to realize that all is not well in the Ombersley household, particularly concerning the marital prospects of her angelically beautiful, 19-year-old cousin Cecilia, and Charles's unfortunate selection of an obnoxiously meddling female for his fiancee.I have lost count of how many times I have read this fantastic, G-rated, Regency romp over the years. Sophy is one of my all-time favorite heroines. She is such a dynamic, warm-hearted woman, it is impossible not to love her. This is a classic comedy of errors, in which two sets of lovers, who receive an HEA at the end of the story, are attached to the wrong partner throughout most of the novel. The joy of that trope in this particular novel is the hilarious machinations that Sophy engages in to bring everything ""to a happy conclusion."" There is also an absolutely delightful subplot in which she attempts to protect Sir Horace's fiancee, an indolent, enormously rich, aristocratic, Spanish lady, from being stolen from underneath her father's nose by a fortune hunter.I originally owned this novel as a mass market paperback, then I purchased it years ago in Kindle format, and I have frequently listened to several different audiobook versions of this novel, which are available through Audible and Hoopla. I never get tired of spending time with Sophy. It is always a delight to revisit her."
