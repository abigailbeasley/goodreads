The stories in my heart and mind were finally going to meet paper. But I wasn’t actually writing anything. When the day started, I knew that I had to write. I wasn’t feeling very well so I would write later. Then, dinner would happen, and I was behind on my reading and didn’t feel any better than earlier in the day. Enter Atomic Habits. After reading the book, I took out my calendar and scheduled, “Writing,” from 1 pm to 1:20 pm. Now, I am actually writing.How many of us have goals: to have better relationships, to lose weight, to learn a language? We have the best of intentions, but we don’t have a plan with manageable actionable steps.Have you ever wondered how I got to be the #3 US Book Reviewer on GoodReads? Atomic Habits.Before reading Atomic Habits, I had what I now realize as wishful thinking or dreams. At times, sometimes I made it on to the top 100 book reviewers, but it was always a complete mystery to me. When I made the list, I couldn't believe my luck! I wanted to rate higher, but I had no real plan.Then, I read Atomic Habits. I sat down and had a clearly articulated goal. ""I want to rate X on the best reviewer list."" Okay. Sounds great. But what does that take? I looked at where I wanted to be on the weekly list and saw how many votes the reviewer received. I divided that number by 7 and knew that I needed to achieve that many votes per day to get to where I needed to be. Sure enough. I met my goal and started to become consistently ranked. Atomic Habits is all about shifting your dreams and wishful thinking into knowing exactly where you want to be and making a plan to get there.Also, it talks about lofty goals.Almost everybody can relate. We make lofty goals: I’m going to run a marathon! I’m going to write a book! I’m going to lose weight! After a few weeks of intense effort (if we make it that far), we give up and go back to the way things were.Did you know that I got back into reading by reading 6 books a year? That’s right. My goal was 6 books per year. The only reason that I initially picked up this book was that someone was RAVING about it, and I was extremely skeptical. I honestly thought that this book was just going to be a bunch of rah rah feel good, you can do it, pep talk. However, it had an entire list of actionable steps you can take to help you make progress on your goals. Little changes can make big differences over time. For example, when I lay out my sheet mask in the morning, I am much more likely to use it at night. This book made me want to write down goals for the year or at least start thinking of the things I wanted to make a priority. This is my second reading of Atomic Habits, and I read it as a buddy read (which I highly recommend). It is interesting to hear about other systems.During this read of Atomic Habits, I was struck by the idea of becoming 1% better.Growing up, I really enjoyed playing basketball. The game is fast-paced, and it was one game where I could actually score. However, I can’t jump very high. I was so fixated on this weak area that I convinced myself that I couldn’t be a basketball player.But you know what? I can sink three-pointers like nobody’s business. At Dave and Buster’s, I can easily achieve the high score. What if I didn’t give up? What if I spent my time trying to get better at running, aiming, teamwork, dribbling? As an overachiever, I do tend to obsess over my weak areas. I spend so much time on the weak area that I ignore some of my other talents. What would I achieve if I just accepted that I am not great in a particular area but focused my time on other areas? Would I enjoy the journey more?If you have tried losing weight or training, I would highly recommend this book. I can definitely see myself reading this once every year—it really is that good!2024 Reading Schedule	Jan	MiddlemarchFeb	The Grapes of WrathMar	Oliver TwistApr	Madame BovaryMay	A Clockwork OrangeJun	PossessionJul	The Folk of the Faraway Tree CollectionAug	Crime and PunishmentSep	Heart of DarknessOct	Moby-DickNov	Far From the Madding CrowdDec	A Tale of Two CitiesConnect With Me!Blog Twitter BookTube Facebook Insta"
1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10293618-simon,Rating 3 out of 5,"This book does a great job of laying down the framework of how habits are formed, and shares insightful strategies for building good habits and breaking bad ones. Even though I was already familiar with research behind habit formation, reading through this book helped me approach habits I’m trying to adopt or break in my own life from different angles.But the book suffers from the same problems that seem to plague all self-help books. In the chapter about tracking habits, the author shares an anecdote about Benjamin Franklin’s habit of carrying a journal everywhere to track thirteen virtues. If you care to know more about that story, Franklin tried to make a habit of his thirteen virtues by turning it into a thirteen week course where he would work on a different virtue every week and track his progress. The author conveniently leaves out the fact that Franklin quickly found this method impractical and abandoned the project before getting through all thirteen virtues. There’s a lot of irony in including this anecdote in a chapter that talks about the importance of not “breaking the chain”. So while the author isn’t entirely wrong, I found it off-putting that he would retell this story in a manner that fit his narrative. This is a vice that is found all too commonly in self-help and pop science books that make you question the author’s intellectual rigour.Another criticism I have of this book is that it could have been even shorter. The last few chapters under “Advanced Tactics” that deal with the topic of mastery were the weakest in the book. While there is an obvious connection between habits and mastery, trying to tie in a topic as complex as mastery was perhaps too ambitious.The three star rating I am giving this book doesn’t reflect how important I consider habits to be. I completely agree with the author that habits are the cornerstone of your life. If you want to change your life in any meaningful way, the only dependable way I know is to build good habits. If you need convincing that habits are important, I would strongly recommend this book. If you are already convinced but struggling to adopt or break habits, racing through this book will give you some good ideas about how you can make changes stick."

You fall to the level of your systems.""- The best way of building a habit is making it part of your identity.- Make it easy to start: Habits are the entry point - not the goal. ""Read 30 books"" ⇒ ""Read before bed every night"" ⇒ ""Read one page"". Reduce a habit into a 2-minute first step.- Stick to the plan: ""Professionals stick to the schedule, amateurs let life get in the way."" Don't be a ""fair weather runner"" if you want to run a lot.- Make it hard to do the things you want to avoid.Most modern ""American self-help books for engineers or entrepreneurs"" (it is a category for me) are too repetitive and too long. Atomic Habits is not! It does have the category-required set of stories of American (mostly men) who built a great habit and got to the top - but just the right amount. ----- NOTES -----*Identity*The three levels of change - the lower the more ""fundamental"":3. Outcomes = Your goals 2. Processes = Your system1. Identity = Who you perceive yourself to beMake every action is a vote for what kind of person you want to become. Building habits is becoming the version of yourself you want to be. Habits help you to trust yourself. - Realize that ""You don't _have to_ do anything, you _get to_."" - Ask ""What would a healthy person do?"". - Ask ""What feel like fun to you, but is work to others?""*Engineer it so that:*Things you want to achieve vs Things you want to avoidObvious —————————————— InvisibleAttractive ————————————UnattractiveEasy ————————————————— HardSatisfying ————————————- SatisfyingFor example: if you want to watch less TV - keep it unplugged - only plugin if you can say out loud the name of the show you want to watch."

“The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it. If you’re proud of how your hair looks, you’ll develop all sorts of habits to care for and maintain it. If you’re proud of the size of your biceps, you’ll make sure you never skip an upper-body workout. If you’re proud of the scarves you knit, you’ll be more likely to spend hours knitting each week. Once your pride gets involved, you’ll fight tooth and nail to maintain your habits.”

 What a doozy of a quote. I guess it pays to be a prideful guy. Well, it seems luck isn't on my side when it comes to personal development reads, and ""Atomic Habits"" by James Clear is no exception. Despite the hype surrounding it, I find myself once again let down by a tired, regurgitated pop psychology book that fails to deliver.The information presented feels like a rehash of what I've stumbled upon in the productivity blogosphere for the past decade. But it's not just the lack of freshness that bothers me—it's the execution. The writing feels robotic, the repetition grows tiresome, and the cherry-picked anecdotes conveniently support the author's points, often taken out of context. Even the scientific references feel shaky and questionable at times.While the core ideas explored in ""Atomic Habits"" aren't inherently bad, they've already been covered by other authors with more depth and skill. Writers like Kelly McGonigal and George Leonard come to mind, offering a richer exploration of the subject matter. Frankly, I can't help but feel that the material in this book could have easily been condensed into a blog post or article. Instead, what I encounter is a bloated book filled with unnecessary fluff, making it feel like an extended infomercial for the author's blog. It's evident that this is just another platform to boost his personal brand and generate 'passive income'.I guess the world really needed another privileged marketer with an A-type personality telling people they can become like him if they follow his 'secret formula.' It seems tailor-made for a specific group of individuals—those who aspire to be the lifestyle-hacker extraordinaire, like Tim Ferris, and his devoted followers.P.S.I should note that despite my disappointment, I've come across individuals who found value in this book, claiming it transformed their lives. However, in most of those cases, they failed to sustain the new habits they initially adopted and years later it's like they never read the book. While ""Atomic Habits"" didn't meet my personal expectations, it may still hold potential for people who are new to the subject or resonate with the author's approach. And hey, if it floats your boat and makes you feel like the captain of your own destiny, who am I to rain on your parade? Happy reading!"
4,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38403162-greg-swierad,Rating 5 out of 5,"The first great book about habits was the Power of Habit. That book was quite theoretical and difficult to apply. This book, Atomic Habits, has a completely different approach. James Clear focused on writing a book that goes deep into every single step of habit creation from a practical point of view. At the end of the day, who we are and what we will achieve depends so much on these small habits that we do every day. James Clear argues, that focusing only on improving those habits will lead to much bigger changes and accomplishments.My top 3 takeaways from this book are:* Forget about goals, focus on the system instead.* Change your identity to change your habits.* Motivation is overrated. Design the environment to support your habits.From this book, I distilled 21 strategies and principles on habit creation, and also I wrote a detailed book summary that you can read here: https://www.mentorist.app/books/atomi..."
5,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2868168-alex-duncan,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book and Emotional Intelligence Habits by Travis Bradberry are my two favorite self-improvement books. Atomic Habits teaches you how small habits (many of which you aren't even aware of) compound over time to make a huge difference in your life. When you work to form good habits they accumulate and build upon each other and you see major changes with very small actions. The book has some suggested habits, but I wish there were many more (specific recommendations for good habits to adopt). That's why I love Emotional Intelligence Habits so much. Emotional Intelligence Habits has more than 700 different habits targeting everything from happiness, confidence, likeability, relationships, leadership, productivity, dealing with toxic people, you name it. It's an incredible book and these two go great together."
6,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35794399-rowan,Rating 3 out of 5,"“Changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years. We all deal with setbacks but in the long run, the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits.""Did not live up to the hype. There’s good material here, and easy-to-follow strategies to improve our habits, but I found it a chore to wade through. My interest ebbed and flowed and ironically, I felt it could be the book to undo my healthy reading habits and routine.Atomic Habits succeeded in bringing awareness to my daily habits and making me more 'present'. The likes of “habit stacking” and “habit tracking” are things that I have started implementing since reading this. But while it’s great to be self-aware and regularly analyse our behaviours, I found it tiresome after a while.“Daily habits are powerful because of how they compound, but worrying too much about every daily choice is like looking at yourself in the mirror from an inch away. You can see every imperfection and lose sight of the bigger picture.”Tedious.James Clear gives many examples of famous people who achieved success via their approach to habits. I enjoyed reading some of those, but far too often, content felt like it was being regurgitated from other books and work in the field of habits and human psychology. Sometimes it felt like he had simply thrown catchy new titles on pre-existing ideas and methods. Other times, it just seemed like common sense.The book is not just about developing good habits and sticking to them, but about eliminating bad ones. I was pleased to see reference to Allen Carr’s Easy Way to Stop Smoking – a book that already made a huge difference to my life! The importance of patience, the difference between 'motion'/'action' and the two-minute rule (when starting a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do) were all takeaways that resonated with me.The chapter summaries were helpful to remember key points, but also made it clear there was substantial filler surrounding a couple of main ideas. These ideas are solid guidelines though, and no doubt helpful for building a better life - I guess time will tell.It's perhaps worth noting that my grievances with Atomic Habits are in the minority - many find this book amazing, so don't let my words prevent you reading this if you think it could be helpful. After all, I'm left wanting to eat healthier, improve my bedtime routines and embrace minimalism - so all this has to be good. “Your actions reveal how badly you want something. If you keep saying something is a priority but you never act on it, then you don’t really want it. It’s time to have an honest conversation with yourself. Your actions reveal your true motivations.”"
7,no user info,Rating 1 out of 5,"Reading this book feels like reading a homework assignment. James Clear wanted to read a lot of books and make a summary of the concepts he would implement for self-improvement. He also made a point in improve himself in the most hacky way possible. Instead of keeping the summary as personal notes, he published it. The fact that the author boasts about being a writer only makes it worse. You can actually smell the cheap tools he uses to put words into text and build chapters out of thin air. I wanted this book to get better, but it doesn't, up to the very end the author repeats the same choice pattern:* Tell them what you are going to tell them, tell them, tell them what you told them.* Simplify science to the border of being wrong. * Abuse of ""as such person said ___INSERT QUOTE HERE____""* Build each chapter out of unacknowledged (stolen/refurbished) concepts, coming from other writings that predate this book.The last point is particularly annoying and the book is plagued by them. He even uses the same graphics and plots as the originals! He includes verbatim whole poems by Lao Tse or writings by Seneca. At least these are attributed and not refurbished. If you are somewhat familiar with the literature, avoid this book.If you are thinking about reading this book, think about the books the author got the content from. Go and read those, you will get the original content without the coarse editing by James Clear. You will also get better foundations for growing a mindset instead of implementing hacks.Start with Why - Simon SinekMastery - George LeonardOutliers - Malcom GladwellThe Tipping Point - Malcom GladwellGetting Things Done - David AllenThe Element - Ken RobinsonBehave - Robert Sapolsky [Science communication written by experts in the field]Thinking Fast and Slow - Daniel Kahneman [Science communication written by experts in the field]"

I didn't want to sit while reading it because I was too busy reorganizing my space while listening to it!Worth it"
9,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12660152-victoria,Rating 1 out of 5,"Why do I keep doing this to myself? All I want is a productive little audiobook to listen to while I work, helpfully filled with tips to improve my life. All I get is priviledged white people recycling the same old advice over and over. This book is especially grating as it's filled with cute little platitudes like ""the same boiling water will soften a potato and harden an egg"". I already know how boiling water works, thanks, can we get to the part where you tell me something I haven't heard from seven other productivity books already?At one point Clear writes, ""I get my assistant to do this for me every week, but if you don't have an assistant..."" I love how some of these productivity authors neglect to mention all the outside help they hire. It's like that other woman who suggested hiring an au pair for when your primary nanny is taking her vacation days. He also suggests doing things like paying for grocery delivery instead of going to the store to save time. He tells the story of one guy who paid his personal trainer $500 every time he forgot to log his food for the day.The real productivity hack seems to be to hire someone to do all the little day-to-day tasks for you so you can focus on other things. This is great if you're fabulously rich, but, if you're like me and don't currently have a full time assistant, and people to do your housework and your meal prep for you, then you may have to look elsewhere for more practical advice.

Atomic also in one regard: As long as it works, it´s perfect down to the smallest part, each atom. If it fails, it´s radioactive and self cannibalizing, -destructing- and demotivating. To exaggerate, we can develop great working, social. and creative habits or destroy ourselves with neuroticism going haywire, find great ways to optimate oneself or madness, just read anecdotal filled pop psychology/science/philosophy books one can read without the danger of the hard work of really changing something or choose the difficult way and this book.The 1st Law Make it obviousRepetition and consequence, as if it wasn´t so shamefully obvious, is one of the key elements to everything, a skill, foreign language, school, degrees,… and the funny thing is that successful people use learning, creativity, memo-, techniques to perfect their skills, but forget the motivational, critical thinking, analytic retrospection, optimization, meditation-,… techniques, and, most importantly, to recapitulate, criticize oneself, let others criticize oneself, reflect, and develop. There is always some space left toward top performance but without modifying or even changing habits, they won´t be possible and nothing is more painful than stopping a working, well known, perfected, but ineffective habit, using an oldfashioned program, modify a schedule, use knowledge and expertise in a new, complicated, unknown way, etc. The brain is a bit bitchy, nagging, and one´s worst enemy, because it´s a lazy manipulator, not wanting one to do something that means real work for it, trying to make it feel as uncomfortable as possible, wanting easy stagnation instead of sweaty evolution. The 2nd Law and 3rd Law Make it attractive and easyAs if this wasn´t already painful and difficult enough, the self experimental subject now has to implement unused, and thereby for the crying, sobbing, angry brain very painful, new neuronal integrated circuits because, as one knows, reptile stem brain and monkeys social anxiety wants one to run far away from everything new, different, possibly dangerous. Here the inner demons have to been disguised as angels to make the whole agony as attractive as possible, a kind of hopeful masochism. Detecting the deficits has already wasted vast resources of willpower and now one doesn´t even have the legitimation to kill and destroy positive change with anger and negative emotions, but the new mind baby has to be raised next to the rascals one has to be tolerant and sympathetic towards.The 4th Law Make it satisfyingReaching this point is tricky, as one needs the stamina, perseverance, and resilience not to resign. As the old behaviors often aren´t directly harmful, just unproductive and used, they will come whispering and trying to get a hold of the subconscious mind to develop back towards the beginning. Humans are creatures of habit and whenever one just loses track and motivation for a second, their siren calls will try to lure you into old behaviors whose reminiscences are still lurking behind each screen, interaction, or working process.And as if all of this wasn´t torture enough, it should come with personal development and vivisecting one´s personality, thoughts, memories, all these things that seemingly aren´t directly related to work, too. Because hidden in the chasms of each simulated reality lies the key to boosting the occupational performance even more by eliminating all the mental corpses of complexes, childhood traumas, anxieties, phobias,… As long they are not overcome, they keep holding one down, interrupting the workflow, reducing concentration, focus, the quality of sleep,… even changing the obvious problems won´t unleash the full potential.A tip, after I´ve read a few of the most highly recommended DIY self brainwashing mind penetrating behavioral modification endeavor books for dummies, I´ve come to the conclusion that most of the theory, techniques, and schedules can easily be found during a longer google search, a Wikipedia or special wiki and Reddit, Quora walk, just using the essential keywords, bookmarking a few dozens to hundreds of pages of interest, copying the subjectively most essential and useful elements and still begin with the 1st law. But it would at least have cost you nothing. It´s getting a bit anecdotally and subjective now, even personal (cause people seem to like that stuff for whatever reason) and, of course, misanthropic, so don´t be shy to stop reading here and saving time and eye power that could be focused on reading something profound. Seriously, I´ve warned you.One of my main advantages is that I am naturally neurotic, a bit of still under control and productive, not negative elements of perfectionism, some might say soft OCD, but who listens to people, pedantic; a bit antisocial, and cold, rational, things very helpful when implementing new behavioral patterns because one doesn´t care about whatever other people think.  I am a bit biased here, because I have the, depending on the standpoint, positive or negative tendency to overachieve and excessively focus on one thing for weeks and months up to 12 or 14 hours a day, obsessive might be an understatement, let´s call it possession instead. Afterward, it´s often difficult to say how the final results, ideas, solutions paths developed, but conditioning oneself to combine focus and flow to hard fun and gamification, optional collaborative learning, yuck, might be a good alternative to just partying hard. This leads me to the extroverts that might face massive deficits in this regard, as they have the unfortunate tendency to spent much unproductive time with other people, leading to excessive, exponentially growth of sympathy, friendship, contact, dangerous pheromones, endorphins, territorial alpha behavior,… manipulating logical thinking, in the worst case not just resulting in friendships, but love, relationships, and kids bringing the distraction in your home, permanently, reproducing and multiplying it and giving it names, all things that make one ineffective, cost time. So start avoiding people, feel cold, sad, and dead inside; and whenever you are doubting, compare what the introvert vs extrovert forever achieving score lists brings in comparison, all science and technical evolution that is human history vs all BS, war, extremism, tradition, all evil isms. Doesn´t an empty, lonely life seem a small price for helping primate progress? Don´t forget thanking me for ruining your socialization with these stupid tips, lol. But seriously, social life is another prime example of habit, one becomes the people she/ he is in regular contact with and attracts more of these people, a dynamic one should not underestimate, and they all feed on you lifetime by craving for your attention, just compare how much one can get from articles and books in comparison to real life drivel filled with small talk, redundancies, errors,..., heck even the better memorization and internalization of content by social contact can be achieved with sophisticated learning techniques. To continue the isolationist standpoint (joke), it´s of course meanwhile absolutely unnecessary to make anything face to face and not in home office, VR, AR, psi transfer remote perception,... the technological singularity in general makes it more and more useless to leave the home castle. A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real life outside books: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positiv...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivationhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavio...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindful..."
11,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/102159719-reading-tamishly,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book just climbed to the top as my most favourite self-help non-fiction of the year!Totally engaging and quite convincing in how the book makes you want to change your bad habits and adopt good ones, this book doesn't talk in a way to make you feel overwhelmed or make you feel like everything you do is wrong or inadequate. The book doesn't give you impractical tips yet it tells stories and what to learn in how to gradually maintain habits that would benefit you in the long run as well as how to start maintaining habits that you have been wanting to in small practical steps. This book is life-changing for me.I have already adopted some of these tips yet the book makes me realise that there are many things that we do that we consider harmless yet taking up most of our time which make us frustrated in real. The tips are easy to understand and follow. The writing is amazing. I would highly recommend this book.This one is already changing my year and the rest of everything else that's going to happen in how I make my future a better and a fulfilling one.Too good to be true. Literally life changing 🍂"

Some of them are written by famous authors like Stephen R. Covey, Charles Duhigg, and Timothy Ferris. I read this book after reading the books by the above authors and was sure that I won't get any new information. Despite discussing a similar topic, James Clear managed to pull a convincing book discussing these familiar ideas in a new way that will help us view our daily routine and life differently and will be a good choice if you are interested in the topic of productivity. —————————————————————————

14,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1720620-anne,Rating 4 out of 5,"Can you get rid of your bad habits?Or maybe more importantly, establish good habits?This had some useful tips in it that may help some people improve their quality of life by slowly (but steadily) forging good habits.One thing I felt would really work was the make it easy mentality. That's a big one. We're all lazy creatures at our core, but some of us are better at streamlining things we don't like to do to make them easier to accomplish.What are you talking about, Anne?Ok, so I noticed that my upstairs was a lot dirtier than my downstairs. If there was a pile of hair and fuzz on my bathroom floor, it would likely sit there until it became sentient. Why? Because my broom, mop, and cleaners were all downstairs. So, I went out and got the exact same stuff and set up a mini cleaning closet in my linen cabinet. And now that everything is within easy reach, my upstairs bathrooms look far less terrifying. Ta-da!I'm keeping things clean using the power of laziness!But the basic gist of what he talks about is really just not giving up. If you didn't go on a walk today, that doesn't mean that you are incapable of getting healthy. The plan is to just put on your shoes. If you can get up and put on your walking shoes, you're halfway there. Yes. Even if you just take your shoes right back off.The goal is to begin the habit with (pun intended) baby steps.As far as self-help books go, this one seems reasonable. There's no weird go-go-go mentality and you don't have to do anything differently, other than to make very small positive changes that will set you up for success. You don't measure your success daily, you look at how far you've come over the course of a year. And with the mindset that doing anything positive to work towards getting better will get more results than if you had done nothing at all.In other words:Some of his tricks and tips require a bit more structure (like getting someone to hold you accountable) but most of the things he tells you to do are pretty painless. And I've always found that sticking to simple, small, easy changes is the best way to get long-term results.Going on some crazy diet that cuts out all {insert food I love here}, never lasts past a year. But cutting down on processed sugar, eating more veg, and going on walks is a long-term doable way to achieve better overall health in the long run. Those types of habits don't necessarily get any sort of flashy results right away but you'll be more likely to keep the results that you do get.Recommended."
15,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"I received this book as a Goodreads giveaway yesterday and immediately settled down to read it. I am always very skeptical of self help books because they often do no get to the root of issues. This one did. James Clear's main arguments are that habits are the compound interest of self improvement and that your identify emerges out of your habits. So, you must expereince a shift in identity for your habits to hold. This made a lot of sense to me, but I do think that Clear should have addresses deeper emotional issues and gave readers resources so as not to mislead them into believing that they can change their identity by action (repeating new habits) alone.

I really wanted to start this year changing habits, incorporating ‘the good new’ and eliminating the bad ones.From the first chapters I began to follow the steps and marveled with the achievements.

I wanted to read a book on habits for a long time now and Atomic Habits met all those criteria.I am not gonna elaborate a lot since it is a well known book and there are a lot of YouTube videos that summed it up better than I can ever do including Abdaal's video here: Check VideoLike all non-fiction books, I found most of the information in the book to be logical but the way it was written and ordered was pretty good. I found it engaging, easy to read and scientific. I enjoy it when authors provide data through real life stories and there was a lot of that here.The book mostly discusses 4 laws to get into a habit or get out of one. These are: Make it Obvious, Make it Attractive, Make it Easy, Make it Satisfying. And if you inverse those you get a way to lose bad habits. A very intriguing read!"

Here's a quick rundown of why I hated it:Ableism throughoutBootstrap mentality Fatphobia throughoutCondescending, patronizing tone from the author (even, or maybe especially, on the audio version.) I could go on...This book had some valid, common sense points, but its flaws far overshadowed any redeeming qualities. Just...nope."

No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity.”I’ve been trying so hard lately to break out of a funk and every self-help book I read recommends starting at the most basic level. We must sort out our daily habits before we can begin to feel better and more fulfilled in our lives. But how do we do this? Gradual change is the answer. If we improve each day by just 1% by the end of the year we will be dramatically and unrecognizably better. Winning tiny battles will determine our future self. Identifying bad habits that are ruining our potential is the key to change. We must eradicate them, slowly, if need be, and replace them with habits that allow us to grow each day. We must set goals and work towards them in a sensible and patient fashion.“You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.”We also need to design a system to achieve our goals. Simply having goals is not enough. We need to have an actionable framework on how we can move towards these otherwise we will never reach them. We must have a process to follow and daily habits that allow us to achieve them. Our level of commitment to the process will determine our level of progress. Sticking to healthy proactive habits with our end goals in mind is the key. So, here’s a little bit about me and my goals for this year: I want to complete a 100-mile ultra-marathon and I also want to have written up a full draft of my PhD. How will I achieve these goals? Habitually running and writing each day, habitually working towards them and remaining committed to the process of daily improvement. I will also read everyday and review on Goodreads more frequently because it helps me remain focused on the process. Daily writing is so important for me as is learning and discovering more literature. I quite enjoyed this. It proposes a very straightforward approach to being successful and one I am very keen to implement into my own life. So let’s do this 2023! ___________________________________You can connect with me on social media via My Linktree.__________________________________"

22,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4669521-renee-gillette,Rating 2 out of 5,"The book was overwhelmingly male-centric. Most of the examples he put forward (other than ballet dancer Twyla Tharp and doctor Anne Thorndike), were about male stockbrokers, scientists, businessmen, sports figures (Michael Phelps, Magic Johnson) and comedians (Steve Martin, Chris Rock). Where are the successful women? Also, it was more about using habits to be ""successful"" in a traditional sense, by making your way to the top of the corporate ladder or excelling in whatever you do, being fit or elite or whatever, instead of improving relationships, decision making, work/life balance, or overall, just being a good person. Funny, I was highlighting a bunch of material (a signal that I was full of hope!) in the first chapter, then it abruptly stopped, and I never highlighted another item in the whole book. The last thing I noted was on page 33, where some guy/entrepreneur says, ""I asked my wife to schedule my first-ever manicure. My thought was that if I started paying to maintain my nails, I wouldn't chew them. And it worked, but not for the monetary reason. What happened was the manicure made my fingers look really nice for the first time.... Suddenly, I was so proud of my fingernails."" Here, I wrote, ""WTF?"" Sorry, but a statement like this reeks of privilege and frankly, makes me want to puke. I am concerned about his wife, and I can't believe it got past the editors. Was this written in 2018 or 1988? In retrospect, this was the moment I should have abandoned the book and opted for something more relevant to my life. Another problem I have with this book.... he talks much, in the beginning of the book, about identity change. ""The goal isn't to read the book, it's to become a reader."" Or ""The goal is not to run a marathon, it's to become a runner...""  Then in the last chapter, in his ""downsides to habit change"" he discusses how identity can hold you back. The key is to ""keep your identity small,"" (some investor guy says) because your identity will change as your role changes (or with age). So, ""I'm an athlete"" becomes ""I'm a person who is mentally tough and loves a challenge."" ""I'm a soldier"" becomes ""I'm the type of person who is disciplined, reliable and great on a team."" ""I'm the CEO"" translates to ""I'm the type of person who builds and creates things."" So, the message is to have a flexible identity. I actually think this is key information that provides a healthy balance in life, and belongs right up there in chapter 1 with all the other information about identity. Rather, it's an afterthought at the very end of the book. And it's contradictory. Also, where is the ""I'm a good listener. I'm there for my kids. I make time to help others. I'm a good friend."" Are all habits so.... macho and self-centered? Maybe I missed the point, or maybe it was just the wrong book for me. That said, I did pull some good information from chapter 13, the two-minute rule/habit shaping. When I opened it to this chapter in the book store where I bought it, I was intrigued. I thought this type of information could help me with my 2021 goals (which have been blown to bits). But I found it the most helpful chapter in the book, overall. I can use the ""art of showing up"" and the concept of not being consumed by the end goal in my life. I learned: If you're a woman and you're looking for a book on habit change, pick up a book written by a woman; preferably one who has done her research and with whom you have something in common."
23,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/114780411-tanu,Rating 5 out of 5,"  ""Success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.""  Goals are useful for charting a course, but systems are the most effective in moving forward. When you spend too much time thinking about your goals and not enough time creating your systems, you'll run into a few issues. The antidote is a systems-first mentality. When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to permit yourself to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running.My 3 major takeaways from this  book are:1. An atomic habit is a regular practice or routine that is small and easy to do and is also the source of incredible power; a component of the system of compound growth.2. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don’t want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change.3. Changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years.Highly recommended to understand the science behind habit building and practically implement those baby steps to build or break a habit.Grab your copy here or here."
24,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49415231-amir-tesla,Rating 2 out of 5,"Well, there’s almost no single shred of original content here. It could be a fine book if it’s the first self-improvement book you have started to read. The science is also flawed. He presents the following elements for habit:1. Cue2. Craving3. Action4. Reward Not to mention that its a skewed copy of principles presented in Power of Habits (to authors credit, he mentions it), craving starts to appear strongly only when your brain has learned to associate the cue, action, reward which happens with repetition. Two star is a good score. It was merely okay. Given the earth-shattering noise it had made, I simply expected more. "

Todo el mundo debería leerlo.Este es otro gran amigo de papel que me encuentro en el camino; amigo que me otorga multitud de enseñanzas para practicar en mi vida personal. ¡Qué satisfecho me siento! Había leído y escuchado muy buenos comentarios de este libro por lo que mis expectativas eran altas, pero afortunadamente fue mejor de lo que esperaba. Desde la introducción me he sentido fascinado por la historia del autor, pero después, cada historia real y cada recomendación me ha parecido fantástica. El autor todo lo presenta de una forma tan sencilla, cada consejo parece ser mejor que el anterior, todo parece ideal; fórmula perfecta para alimentar el interés del lector no solo para seguir leyendo sino también para practicarlo en su vida real.Siempre había tenido la creencia de que crear un hábito es algo supremamente difícil pero después de esta lectura siento que he estado errado muchísimos años y que realmente es bastante sencillo. Siempre había buscado un método que me ayudara a centralizar mi vida, a clasificar lo bueno y lo malo, a encontrar un fortín desde el cual dirigir, y creo que eso es exactamente lo que he hallado en esta ocasión.Motivación, pragmatismo, sabiduría. Todo eso lo encontré aquí. Cuando realice la reseña completa contaré un poco cómo me ha ido después de aplicar en mi vida personal los principios de esta obra. Les contaré que buenos hábitos he logrado establecer. También les contaré cuáles han sido los negativos que he logrado abandonar.Libro súper recomendado. Reseña completa más adelante."

The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Here, you'll get a proven system that can take you to new heights.Clear is known for his ability to distill complex topics into simple behaviors that can be easily applied to daily life and work. Here, he draws on the most proven ideas from biology, psychology, and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide for making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible. Along the way, readers will be inspired and entertained with true stories from Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving physicians, and star comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of their field.عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «عادت‏‌های اتمی؛ تغییرات کوچک و نتایج چشمگیر راهی آسان و اثبات‏‌شده برای ایجاد عادت‏‌های خوب و ترک عادت‏‌های بد»؛ «تغییرات جزئی، نتایج چشمگیر»؛ «عادت‌های اتمی‮‬‏‫: یک راه ساده و اثبات‌شده برای ایجاد عادات خوب و شکستن عادات بد، تغییرات کوچک، نتایج قابل توجه»؛ «عادت‌های اتمی»؛ «راه آسان و اثبات شده برای ایجاد عادت‌های خوب و شکستن عادت‌های بد، تغییرات کوچک، نتایج قابل توجه»؛ «جورنال خرده‌ عادت‌ها»؛ «عادت‌های اتمی: خرده عادت‌ها»؛ «عادتهای اتمی: تغییرات کوچک، نتایج چشمگیر»؛ «عادت‌های اتمی: راهی آسان و اثبات شده برای ایجاد عادت‌های خوب و ترک عادت‌های بد»؛ «عادت‌های اتمی: عادت‌های کوچک شخصیت شمارا شکل می‌دهند راهکارهای موثر برای جذب عادت خوب و ترک عادت‌های بد»؛ «عادت‌های اتمی : تغییرات کوچک، نتایج چشمگیر روشی آسان و اثبات‌شده برای ساختن عادت‌های خوب و شکستن عادت‌های بد»؛ و ...؛ نویسنده: جیمز کلییر؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش روز بیست و ششم ماه اکتبر سال 2018میلادیعنوان: عادت‏‌های اتمی؛ تغییرات کوچک و نتایج چشمگیر راهی آسان و اثبات‏‌شده برای ایجاد عادت‏‌های خوب و ترک عادت‏‌های بد؛ نویسنده: جیمز ��لیر؛ مترجم هوشمند دهقان؛ تهران، هورمزد، سال1397؛ در320ص؛ شابک9786226010221؛ موضوع: ترک عادت از نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا -

To create a good habit, author James Clear suggests:  - Make it Obvious - Make it Attractive - Make it Easy - Make it SatisfyingWhile at first glance these may seem overly simplistic, Atomic Habits delves into each of these concepts and also describes how these same ideas can be inverted to break bad habits. The content is easily digestible. Different parts are likely to resonate with different readers but I found a lot of helpful information in this book, especially in one of the final chapters about how to stay motivated — Mastery requires practice. ”The only way to become excellent is to become endlessly fascinated with doing the same thing over and over. You have to fall in love with boredom.”Atomic Habits is a read I recommend for anyone trying to step up their game, in any facet of life, with the reminder that refinement and improvement are continuous, long-term processes."
28,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/96955799-dragos-p-traru,Rating 4 out of 5,"Ideea cărții este pe cât de simplă pe atât de adevărată și puternică și o aveți chiar în descrierea din subtitlu. Autorul folosește o mulțime de exemple pentru a arăta că: 1. Schimbările mici pot avea un impact foarte mare în viețile noastre. Dacă halești zilnic un burger de la Mec sau o găleată de pui de la Kafece, peste zece ani nu-ți va plăcea deloc ce vei vedea în oglindă și nici ce-ți va arăta cântarul. Dacă alergi juma de oră pe zi, lucrurile vor sta cu totul altfel. 2. Obiceiurile noastre sunt comportamente automate pe care le învățăm din experiență. Intri într-o cameră în care e întuneric, vei căuta automat întrerupătorul. De-aia, diferența pe termen lung o fac rutinele zilnice. Dacă ele sunt bune, rezultatul pe termen lung e excelent. 3. Construiești obiceiuri bune schimbând lucruri în viața ta și înconjurându-te de lucruri care declanșează acele obiceiuri pe care le vrei în viața ta. Eu nu am reușit să repet consistent la chitară, de pildă, până când nu am avut patru chitare, puse în locuri strategice: la masa din bucătărie la care stau destul de mult, la birou, în dormitor, în terasa de lângă casă, în care petrec ceva timp în weekend lucrând. La fel, cu exercițiile fizice. Am amenajat o sală la redacție, de care eu și colegul Marote profităm din plin, dar am și acasă ”matereale”, benzi elastice, gantere, kettlebell, saltea, bancă, ladă pentru sărituri, tot ce-mi trebuie pentru antrenamente complete și variate. Că dacă ești vineri, sâmbătă și duminică la grătare și șpriț nu vei putea schimba mare lucru la felul în care arăți. Fix la fel e și cu cititul și cu toate celelalte obiceiuri bune. 4. Ca să te țină, trebuie să faci obiceiurile atractive. Cum? Cu recompensă. Nu neapărat cum a făcut un inginer irlandez, care a legat o bicicletă de exersat acasă la computer, astfel încât Netflixul, de care omul era dependent, nu rula decât la o anumită viteză a bicicletei, dar trebuie să legi activitatea de un rezultat care îți face plăcere. Uite, eu, de pildă, pun periodic pe rețelele sociale poze după antrenamentele la sală. Iar faptul că oamenii apreciază munca pe care o fac pentru mine - da, oamenii se mulțumesc să-i aplaude pe alții, prea puțini se și apucă de treabă - mă încarcă și pe mine, astfel încât să pot continua. 5. Fă obiceiul accesibil, dacă vrei să îți fie ușor. La fel, fă-l inaccesibil, dacă e un obicei de care vrei să scapi. Uite, eu, de pildă, nu pot să adorm dacă nu mă uit la ceva film sau meci sau emisiune. Așa că primul pas a fost să scot cablul tv din dormitor. Apoi, am recurs la tabletă. Și am observat că dacă pun un film sau un meci nu adorm, mă ține treaz acțiunea. Așa că am luat cea mai bună decizie din viața mea: adorm seară de seară ascultând cursuri. Fie că e vorba de Masterclass, fie că e vorba de tot felul de prelegeri ale unor profesori puse pe yt (mare chestie yt premium, că nu te mai opresc reclamele), fie că e vorba de podcasturi, dau drumul și în cel mult zece minute adorm (asta și după ce am adoptat o rutină de respirație care induce somnul - inspir numărând până la patru, expir numărând până la 8, adormi ca un copil, tati!)6. Ține un jurnal cu schimbările pe care le faci, cu obiceiurile bune și cu efectele lor. Uite, a te poza periodic și a compara pozele este o bună metodă de a rămâne motivat, pentru că schimbările se văd de la o lună la alta, de la un anotimp la altul, de la un an la altul. Cam asta ar fi. Cei mai mulți dintre oameni eșuează în adoptarea unor obiceiuri bune pentru că vor rezultate imediate, pentru că nu au deloc răbdare și viziune, nu se pot vedea pe ei peste doi-trei ani, pentru că nu știu cum să rămână motivați, pentru că pun greșit problema. Uite, de pildă, mâncarea. În loc să ne preocupe în primul rând sănătatea, cum ne influențează sănătatea dieta, pe noi ne preocupă relațiile sociale și plăcerea pe care ne-o produce zahărul, de pildă. Sau alcoolul. Sau prăjelile de tot soiul, ori carnea în exces. Cât timp nu ne setăm mintea cum trebuie, cât timp nu ne stabilim clar prioritățile, nu vom putea să fim stăpânii propriei existențe.

32,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7309374-rowosthlm,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is a dual review of two books about habit. Habits are important things in one’s life and there are numerous books on the subject. The classic book, a must read, is The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen R. Covey. Another two popular books about habits are The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg and Atomic Habits by James Clear, that came out very recently. Having read all three of them I combined my notes for the last two in this post. No matter what stage in life you are, it is always good to review one’s habits and behaviour – these books provide a good framework for doing it.One of the habits I’m struggling with is to get rid of the reading of self-help books. Thus, reading The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg and parallelly Atomic Habits by James Clear became a sort of a meta enterprise. Would these self-help books about habits help me to get rid of the habit of reading self-help books? There’s nothing wrong with the self-help genre per se. I believe, everybody should strive to become a better version of themselves. Evidently, there’s a lot of great wisdom in this type of books – many prominent figured refer to them when they tell the story of their success. However, having read tons of them, one would usually circle around the same known stuff and shabby ideas wrapped in different narratives and supported by different anecdotes. The trick here is to know when to stop and, actually, go out and do something by using the knowledge and inspiration gained.My own habit of falling back to self-help books is, obviously, grounded in the alluring products of the habit loop driven by the craving for knowledge on self-improvement. We can use the basic members of the habit loop – cue, routine, and reward – well covered in the Duhigg’s book and analyse the situation with the reading of self-help books. For this type of products, the cues (triggers) are everywhere, and who can ignore the wish for excellence? Then, the routine is easily carried out – the messages in those books are straightforward that doesn’t require a very deep thinking and reading between the lines. It just assumes the acceptance in many cases, and, finally, the reward is instant – the feeling of getting something very valuable – a digested wisdom and not seldom a bit of inspiration. It can be compared to junk food (which by the way is almost gone from my life thanks to this kind of books). However, my point is not to pick on this genre, but rather to stress the importance of not getting stuck in it, as in my previous point. Habit as a phenomena humans and other living creatures are equipped with is one of my favourite subjects. I strongly believe, in the end, habits defines us and our destiny. The subject of habit covers several interesting areas as neuroscience, biology, psychology, and more. The basic mechanics of habit system can be described through the theory of operand conditioning, a term coined by B.F. Skinner back in 1930. It is a technique of learning that occurs through reward and punishment for behaviour. Through operand conditioning, an individual makes an association between a behaviour and a consequence. A relatively simple feedback loop forming habits of an individual can be described in terms of drive, stimulus, response, reward with different kind of reinforcers – positive or negative. What was lacking in the model of operand conditioning was other influencers like feelings, thoughts, and, very importantly – beliefs. Moreover, human behaviour is so complex that factors as the environment and group psychology are of crucial importance when it comes to the habit science. Modern behavioural science takes these terms into account and they are very important in the habit theory. The authors of both books did a great job addressing these factors in their respective methodologies.Based on the early theory of operand conditioning, different models around habits and behaviour (in my interpretation, behaviour is a series of actions evoked by habits) are developed and fundamental terms are just called different names. Charles Duhigg in The Power of Habit grounds his model on the habit loop consisting of cue-routine-reward parameters which are driven by craving. James Clear in Atomic Habits suggests his model consisting of four steps called cue, craving, response, and reward. These factors are systematically analysed by respective author and the steps how to build good habits and remove the bad ones based on these models are suggested. In both books I found some valuable and interesting points as well as good tips on how to keep one’s habits on the right track.As one can see from the parameters in each model, there’s a difference in the arrangement of them making some differences in application of the methodologies of habit treatment. Duhigg sees the term craving as a driving force for the members in the habit loop – cue, routine, reward. Clear suggests that craving is simply a second stage in his model of habit. This is the main difference, and I need to admit I haven’t put enough time to analyse which model is right – both make sense. We would need some deeper diving in relevant disciplines and get help from ontology of the actual things here. Anyhow, I tend to believe that a craving lies above cue, routine, and reward. Cues alone without craving are meaningless. Nevertheless, both models are very useful for working on one’s habits. Duhigg argues that the way of changing or replacing of habit is to focus on the routine parameter, or the response part according to the terminology or Clear. Clear gives a lot of examples on how the cue and reward steps can be worked on. I completely agree that even these parts can be influenced, whereas Duhigg argues that the most important thing is to focus on routine leaving cues and rewards unchanged. I believe, we can remove unwanted triggers. Like making the tempting things like candies hard to reach and out of sight, etc. This has been well researched in a very interesting work by Richard H. Thaler for which he was awarded the Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2017. Then, we can reprogram our brain to think about rewards differently – change the mode of them or reinforce the distant rewards requiring immediate sacrifice by some direct reward. Clear has a lot of good examples how to do it.Habit should be seen as one of the essential parts forming an individual. A brilliant quote by Margaret Thatcher shows the operational importance of habits: “Watch your thoughts, for they will become actions. Watch your actions, for they'll become... habits. Watch your habits for they will forge your character. Watch your character, for it will make your destiny.” If we put those terms it in a different order, we can see that habits are very important, perhaps more important than one’s thoughts, because they are operational tools defining which actions one will take and what destiny those actions will form.In summary, if you are somehow unsatisfied with any of your habits and would like to actively and effectively change them and thus become an individual you’d like to be, I strongly recommend both books. I would read The Power of Habit book first, this book is longer, has more stories, and has more research behind it. Atomic Habits book is easier to get through, especially after reading Duhigg’s book. Both books, as you might have guessed, are clear, easy to read and grasp. They will give you the right mindset to approach your behaviour and provide valuable tools to shape your personality."

It could have been a nice short article, but it was bloated with fluff instead and made into a book. One might even say, that it feels like reading a Coelho of pop-psychology. The relevant parts could be really summed up in a couple of pages and it would be a nice blogpost worth of maybe even 3 stars. As a book, it is a collection of oversimplified scientific knowledege, wild misinterpretations and parallels, and plenty of anecdotes combined with some dubious sources (sourcing from Twitter, Reddit, Youtube and even investment blogs). Author works most of the time with relevant sources for the scientific statements, but they usually don't play any significant role in what he is proposing in the book and the facts are usually out of context and serve mostly the role of fun facts with no relevance for the points being made. What you end up with is some trivial tips for creating new habits, with regular advertising notes sending you to author's website, and plenty of unnecessary information, including some very dubious life coaching tips. My bottom line is, that this book is heavilly overrated motivational/self-help book and I wish I would have received an apropriate warning before I purchased it. So hopefully, my review will save you some time and money."

We all have certain habits we want to learn or unlearn and we usually start strong but lack the motivation to stick to it. This book really expanded my mind about what it actually takes to make habits stick and how motivation has VERY little to do with it. I added a few of key quotes from the book that touch on some of the steps: why the smallest habits matter, awareness, repetition over perfection, focus on environment, how to keep going when the initial flame of motivation dies down, learn / unlearn your identity, pay attention to the words you use. #vlbookclub"

There is some good advice--get rid of obstacles, use cues of things you like to do with things you need to do (i.e., everytime you check facebook, do pushups or whatever). It's good advice, but nothing new or unique. "

37,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5662959-youghourta,Rating 4 out of 5,"كتاب ""العادات الذّرّيّة"" يتحدثّ حول كيفية بناء عادات حميدة جديدة وكيفية التّخلص من عادات سيّئة. في حقيقة الأمر لم تكن أغلب مُحتويات الكتاب جديدة علي، فمعظمها يعتمد على دراسات ومصادر إما ذائعة الصيت أو سبق لي أن صادفتها في كتب أخرى، ككتاب ""قوة العادة""* أو حتى كتاب ""كيف تفشل تقريبًا في كل شيء ومع ذلك تربح في النهاية بشكل كبير""** والذي بالرغم من أنه ليس كتابًا حول بناء العادات لكنّه استعرض إحدى أقوى الأفكار المُتعلّقة ببناء العادات والمُتعلّقة بالاعتماد على الأنظمة بدل الأهداف . كتاب ""العادات الذّرّيّة"" يذكر هذا الكتاب لدى استعراضه لهذه الفكرة.قبل أن أخوض في تفاصيل هذا الكتاب أودّ أن أستعرض فكرة ""التركيز على الأنظمة بدل الأهداف"" لأنها في غاية الأهمية. لتوضيح الفكرة إليك المثال التالي: لنفرض أنك ترغب في إنقاص وزنك لتصل مثلًا إلى 70 كيلوجرام. لو سطّرنا هذا الهدف وبعد أشهر قليلة وصلت إليه عبر وسائل عدّة، فإن أول ما سيواجهك بعد الوصول إلى هذا الهدف هو سؤال ""ما التالي؟"" وقد لا تجد إجابة واضحة حول هذا السؤال، بل وقد ينتهي بك المطاف إلى اكتساب كل الوزن الزائد الذي تخلّصت منه قبل وزيادة، لأنه في البداية كان لديك هدف ""يجب أن أخفّض وزني إلى 70 كيلوجرام"" وقد حقّقته وبعد الوصول إلى هذا الهدف، لم يعد لديك ما تعمل عليه. لكن في المُقابل لو اعتمدت على نظام بدل هدف، كأن تقول ""سأتبع نظاما سيسمح لي بالحفاظ على جسم رشيق وصحّة جيّدة وسأقوم بذلك عبر تجنّب الأكل غير الصّحي، اختيار ما آكله بشكل مدروس ومُمارسة الرياضة بشكل دوري"" فإنه وحتى بعد وصولك إلى مثل الهدف السابق (70 كج) فإنك ستواصل العمل وفق نفس النظام، لأن النظام لا يهدف إلى هدف بعينه، وإنما غايته هو الحفاظ على ذلك النظام، كما أن تحقيق الأهداف من خلال هذا النظام سيكون مجرد ""عرض جانبي"".أفضل ما يُميّز هذا الكتاب هو أسلوب الكتابة المُتّبع فيه، حيث أن الفصول مكتوبة بشكل واضح يسهّل استهلاكها. لكن أفضل خاصّية على الإطلاق هو تلخيصه لكل فصل في خاتمته.يبني الكاتب فكرته حول الأفكار القاعدية التالية:- بناء العادات يتم تدريجيًا وليس دفعة واحدة ويتم على فترات قد لا تكون قصيرة. ركّز على تحسين نفسك تدريجيا (مثلًا 1 بالمئة كل يوم) وستحصل على نتائج مُذهلة مع مرور الوقت.- مثلما يُمكنك بناء عادات حسنة بشكل تدريجي وعلى فترات طويلة فقد يحصل عكس ذلك معك أيضًا دون أن تشعر. يُمكنك مثلًا أن تحصل على عادة سيّئة عبر نفس المبدأ، كأن تتساهل مع قليل من الأكل غير الصّحي بشكل تدريجي حتى تجد بأن طعامك أصبح كلّه غير صحّي.- تحتاج إلى الصّبر لدى بناء عادات حميدة، فالعديد من التحسينات الصغيرة (الـ 1 بالمئة آنفة الذكر) لن تُلحَظ على المدى القصير وقد تُصاب بالإحباط. يضرب الكاتب مثالًا بقطعة ثلج موضوعة خارج الثلاجة، رغم ارتفاع درجة حرارة الغرفة التي أنت فيها بشكل تدريجي (درجة واحدة مثلا كل فترة) فلن تلحظ بأن قطعة الثلج تذوب، لكن بعد مرور ما يكفي من الوقت (تراكم تلك الزيادات في درجات الحرارة) وبعد تجاوز درجة حرارة مُعيّنة فستلاحظ بأن تلك القطعة شرعت في الذوبان بشكل مُتسارع قبل أن ينتهي بها المطاف وقد ذابت عن آخرها. هذه النقطة في غاية الأهمية لكل من يرغب في بناء عادات حميدة.- أفضل طريقة لتغيير عاداتنا ليس بالتركيز على ما نرغب في تحقيقه (أرغب في أن أمارس الرياضة بشكل يومي) ولكن بالتركيز حول ما ترغب في أن تُصبح (أرغب في أن أصبح رياضيا).- العادة عبارة عن سلوك قمنا بتكراره مرات عديدة حتى أصبح تلقائيًا.- الهدف الرئيسي من بناء العادات هو حل المشاكل التي نواجهها في الحياة اليومية بأقل جهد مُمكن.- يُمكن تقسيم كل عادة إلى 4 مراحل: الإشارة +، الرغبة/التوق ++، الاستجابة +++ و المُكافأة ++++.- لبناء العادات الحميدة (أو للتخلص من العادات السيئة) يُمكننا الاعتماد على ""إطار عمل"" متكوّن من 4 مبادئ أساسية:- اجعلها ظاهرة /واضحة- اجعلها جذّابة- اجعلها سهلة 	- اجعلها مُرضِيةهذه المبادئ تُصبح على النّحو التالي لما يتعلّق الأمر بالتّخلص من عادات سيّئة:- اجعلها مخفية- اجعلها غير جذّابة- اجعلها صعبة- اجعلها غير مُرضِية1/ اجعلها ظاهرة /واضحة- لجعل العادة الحميدة التي ترغب في الحصول عليها ظاهرة/واضحة فإنك تحتاج أن تربطها إما بوقت مُعيّن أو بمكان معُيّن (سأقوم بكذا في الوقت الفلاني أو سأقوم بكذا في المكان الفلاني).- يُمكن أيضًا بناء العادات الحميدة عبر ربطها بعادات أخرى أصبحت تلقائية. على سبيل المثال بعد أن أفعل [العادة س] سأقوم بـ [العادة ع].- اجعل من بيئتك / الأماكن التي تتواجد فيها طرفًا فعّالا في بناء العادات ولا تعتمد كثيرًا على قوّة الإرادة. على سبيل المثال إن أردت أن تبني عادة شرب ما يكفي من الماء كل يوم فضع قنينات ماء في أماكن مُختلفة وبشكل واضح في مكتبك/منزلك.- بعد بناء أي عادة (سواء كانت حميدة أو سيّئة) فإنه من المُستبعد أن تنساها بشكل كامل.- بدل أن تعتمد على ""التّحكم في النفس"" من الأفضل أن تتجنّب ما يُذكّرك بالعادة (الإشارة cue) بدل أن تراقب نفسك باستمرار. فمن السهل أن تتجنب الإغراء على أن تمانعه.- التحكم في النفس/مُمانعة إغراء العادات السيّئة قد يصلح على المدى القصير فقط.2/ اجعلها جذّابة- اجعل العادات الحسنة التي ترغب في الحصول عليها مُغرية.- ما يجعلنا نقوم بما نقوم به ليس إنهاء المهمة بقدر انتظار ""المُكافأة"" التي سنحصل عليها.- أفضل طريقة لبناء العادات الحميدة هي ربطها بشيء نرغب فيه. على سبيل المثال قد ترغب في مُشاهدة التلفاز (تتوق نفسك لذلك) لكن يُمكنك أن تربط ذلك بممارستك للرياضة لدى قيامك بذلك، كأن تضع دراجتك المنزلية مقابلة للتلفاز وأن لا تُشاهد التلفاز إلا لما تكون على الدراجة.- الثقافة/المُجتمع الذي نعيش فيه له تأثير كبير على مدى جاذبية بعض العادات بالنسبة لنا (قد تجد هذه العادة أو تلك جذابة في بيئة مُعيّنة ومُنفّرة في بيئة أخرى). يعني نستحسن ما يستحسنه المُجتمع ونستقبح ما يستقبحه.- أفضل طريقة لبناء عادات حميدة هي أن تحيط نفسك ببيئة تستحسن تلك العادة التي ترغب في بنائها. فعلى سبيل المثال إن أردت أن تُصبح رياضيا وتكون في صحّة جيّدة فستحتاج أن تُحيط نفسك بأشخاص يولون هذه الأمور اهتمامًا كبيرًا (كما يقول المثل الجزائري: “الصاحب ساحب"").3/ اجعلها سهلة- ركّز على المُمارسة أكثر من تركيزك على التخطيط للعادة التي ترغب في الحصول عليها.- ركّز على عدد المرات التي تقوم بها بالعادة التي ترغب في الحصول عليها وليس في الوقت الكلي الذي أمضيته في القيام بها.- بناء العادات هي الآلية التي من خلالها تصبح تلك السلوكيات آلية بشكل تدريجي عبر المُمارسة (ركّز على التّدرج وعلى المُداومة).- من عادة البشر القيام بالأمور التي تتطلب جُهدّا أقل. وعليه تحتاج أن تخلق لنفسك بيئة يسهل فيها القيام بالعادة التي ترغب في اكتسابها. على سبيل المثال إن كنت ترغب في ممارسة الرياضة صباح كل يوم، فستحتاج أن توفر ما سيسهل عليك اتخاذ هذا القرار صباح كل يوم عبر تجهيز ملابس الرياضة ووضعها في مكان ظاهر في غرفتك.- لدى بنائك لعادة جديدة فحاول أن لا يتجاوز الوقت الذي تُخصصه لها في البداية أكثر من دقيقتين. على سبيل المثال (ومع مثال الرياضة من جديد) هل ترغب في ممارسة الرياضة بشكل دوري؟ ركّز في البداية على نقطة واحدة فقط وهو أن تلبس ملابسك الرياضية (حتى ولو لم تمارس أية تمارين).- ركّز على بناء العادة أولا وبعدها يُمكن تحسين أدائك (اجعل من لبس ملابس الرياضة عادة آلية وبعدها يمكنك أن تضيف التمارين الرياضية إليها تدريجيا).4/ اجعلها مُرضِية- لديك حظوظ أوفر للحفاظ على عادتك لو جعلتها مُرْضية (تحصل على نتيجة مُرضية من خلالها).- العقل البشري مجبول على حب المكافآت قريبة الأمد على تلك التي سيحصل عليها في المُستقبل البعيد.- القاعدة الذهبية لتغيير العادات هي: ما نحصل من خلاله على مكافأة آنية (في حينها) ستُكرّر وما سنُعاقب عليه آنيا سيُتجنّب.- لتبني عادات حميدة فستحتاج أن تحصل على تلك المُكافآت الآنية حتى ولو كانت صغيرة.- المبادئ الثلاثة الأولى تهدف إلى ضمان القيام بالعادة في وقتها. هذا المبدأ الرابع يهدف إلى ضمان تكرار العادة المرة القادمة.- أفضل شعور لدى بناء عادات حميدة هو الشعور بأنك تحرز تقدّما. وعليه فمن المنصوح به تتبّع مدى تقدّمك في رحلة بنائك لتلك العادة.- حاول أن لا تقطع سلسلة العادة التي ترغب في بنائها. على سبيل المثال إن كنت تضع علامة إكس على رزنامتك كل يوم تمارس فيه الرياضة فحاول أن تبقي على سلسلة علامات إكس طويلة وغير منقطعة قدر الإمكان. إن اضطررت إلى قطع تلك العادة مرّة فحاول أن لا تقطعها يومين مُتتاليين.- قد تستفيد من إخبار صديق أو زوجتك (زوجك) بالعادات التي ترغب في بنائها، وجود شخص يلعب دور ""الرقيب"" سيزيد من احتمال تحول ذلك السلوك إلى عادة آلية.- ستحصل على أكبر قدر من التحفيز لما تعمل على مهام تقع على حدود قدراتك الحالية. بعبارة أخرى إذا أردت أن ""تنمو"" أو أن ""تنمي قدراتك"" فيجب عليك أن تسعى للبقاء في هذا المكان أطول مدّة مُمكنة. بطبيعية الحال كلما زاد نموّك كلما توجّب عليك التقدّم أكثر لتبقى في حالة ""العمل على حدود قدراتك الحالية"".- أكبر مُشكل سيواجهك لما تُكوّن عادات جديدة هو قيامك بتلك المهام دون تفكير (هذا أصلًا أحد ركائز بناء العادات لكن قد يُمثّل أكبر نقاط ضعفها أيضًا في آن واحد). الإشكال هو أنه ومع مرور الوقت لا نُلقي بالًا للتفاصيل الدقيقة. وعليه يتوجّب علينا مُراجعة عاداتنا المُكتسبة بشكل دوري.- الإتقان يكون نتيجة تكوين عادات جيّدة ومُواصلة العمل على تحسينها (التّدّرّب المُتواصل).الكتاب مُفيد، خفيف وسهل الهضم. قد ترغب في قراءته مرّتين، المرة الأولى لتكتشف القواعد الأساسية لبناء العادات الحميدة (والتّخلّص من العادات السّيّئة) ومرة أخرى لما تكون لديك عادة مُعيّنة ترغب في بنائها. قد ترغب أيضًا في قراءة كتاب ""قوة العادة""* أو حتى كتاب ""كيف تفشل تقريبًا في كل شيء ومع ذلك تربح في النهاية بشكل كبير""** بعد الفراغ منه للاستزادة حول هذا الموضوع. ---* ""قوة العادة"": the power of Habit** ""كيف تفشل تقريبًا في كل شيء ومع ذلك تربح في النهاية بشكل كبير"": How To Fail At Almost Everything And Still Win Big+ الإشارة Cue++ الرغبة/ا��توق craving +++ الاستجابة response++++ المُكافأة reward.ملاحظة: سبق وأن نشرت هذه المُراجعة على مُدوّنتي

The audio version of this is great, crisp and easy to understand.The building of habits, not so much in what you want to achieve, but the way you go about it. The process. Surprisingly there is a lot to be said about this, and I think I do a lot of this stuff already, methodically tidying up as I go etcetera, to make the foundation easier. Think smart, and being organised for example. Being a fastidious tidier is much easier than making myself run for an hour a day though, but I can see where using his ideas are very smart.I liked the idea of a high level weights coach, in answering James question about what sets up the difference to those good in a field, to those that excel just that bit higher. The answer surprised him, and I agreed. It was those willing to be bored with the consistency of training the same way over and over. So - one must make the process interesting, rewarding and fresh. Oh - and accountability!Interesting concepts that are very common in getting in the way such as all or nothing thinking, and not missing more than two days in a row are interesting, as is giving up things or paying for things when a 'contract' is not fulfilled to the agreed measurements.It would be worthwhile me taking a look at the hard copy of this, because there are fundamentals and stages, which form the process of the whole, so to speak.I am trying to become a runner again, and listening to this book during this period in my life was helpful. The author is clear and concise. I will still procrastinate, but I took with me a lot of good things as well. I really enjoyed the examples the author gave to support his ideals, and these range from current days to times long past. Recommended as a little heftier some self help books out there I'd say. Like any book in this field, take what you want and leave the rest, but there is lots of food for thought here."

I heard about this book from different sources which propelled me to put it on hold. My usual scepticism was pretty quickly sent to smithereens. First of all, Clear is a very good narrator, he's got a lovely voice and accent. Second, he didn't try to sell me anything. Third, the book is very matter of fact, with a mix of psychology, examples and, most importantly, actionable steps. Also, it didn't have any spiritual mambo jumbo something that grinds my gears. So if you want to acquire new habits or drop some bad ones, this might help you."

45,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12800930-bharath,Rating 4 out of 5,"Many people I know have read this book and recommended it to me since some time. While I read a good amount of non-fiction, I find new ideas are hard to come by over time. The good thing is that this book did have some well laid out concepts, and was also less pretentious than much of the self-help fare available.The central idea is that you can start small and build lasting habits. The habit loop (starting with a cue) is similar to that laid out in ‘The Power of Habit’ which the author also briefly references. This book, however, in contrast has more practical tips for building personal habits. I liked the concept of ‘identity’ – it felt fresh and very logical, though not immediately apparent. How we think of ourselves is critical to building habits. For instance, thinking of yourself as a writer, reader or runner causes the brain to react differently than saying ‘I will write a book’, ‘I will read a book’ or ‘I will run 5 miles’. Another important takeaway is around pursuing goals vs running systems. Everybody has goals and it is not goal setting which leads to success, but the process. There is also coverage on how you can approach habit building systematically and make it easy & rewarding. Overall, a useful book which I think should deliver results. The later sections are bloated though, filling pages – when the content should have been far crisper.I listened to the audiobook narrated by the author, and it was very good."

I started reading  Atomic Habits  on my Kindle and just 15% in I felt I had highlighted and underlined basically every line, so much so I had to go out and get a physical copy of the book so I could go through slowly. WHAT A BOOK! This is a must read book for everyone! Jame Clear really gets to the heart of what it takes to build healthy habits and what it takes to get rid of the unhealthy ones. I think everyone could benefit from reading this book and putting into practice the advice given. For me, I love how clear James Clear was in this book in the work that goes into forming healthy and getting rid of unhealthy habits. Clear offers practical advice on how to build these habits, in ways that aren't overwhelming. I love how feasible his suggests were and I look forward to putting them into practice.  It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis.  This is a major thing for me. I get so caught up in having a defining moment that I lose sight of making the small improvements on a daily basis that leads to these defining moments. I liked that Clear focus on how you can tiny improvements on a daily basis that will lead to major improvements. Finally, if you are like me, I focus on the big goals... I get lost in trying to achieve that goal and I dont focus on what can lead to me achieving these goals. In Atomic Habits, James Clear talks about the process that leads to the goals and how we need to focus more on putting process and systems in place to achieve these goals. This is a solid read and I recommend this books to anyone who is struggling to put in place new healthy habits and get rid of unhealthy ones. Please grab a copy and change your life."

After reading a few pages, the easy-going and casual tone of the book engages me to read on. The author correlates plenty deep and academic evaluation. My take on is to handle life overwhelming and stressful; having a certain number of good practices can prioritize the more important work. Also, as we know, starting and keeping a good habit is easier said than done, but ""a thousand miles begins with a single step,"" and one tiny little action change incorporated into our routine can become a ritual that possibly will make significant changes to our life down the road. Emphasizing becoming the person of the new habit rather than forcing a new practice in place is one of the great ideas coming from this book. Knowing now that motion is NOT equal to action, taking action is the step that will count in the end toward progress in forming new habits or goals inspires me. The style of the book is dogmatic and actionable, which lays out a list of practical methods that will benefit and spur habit creation, thus breaking the bad ones. However, I do find that there are not many cutting-edge ideas that seemed revolutionary or thought-provoking. Instead, many testimonies and examples from other sources and shared experiences from the author's time spent learning and mastering this topic wins the book's credibility."

Sticking to the daily routine is boring and all of us may get stuck, bored, want to go back to the normal routine, yet the ones who keep on undergoing the pain of discipline win.

There were some good tips, but I feel like the useful information could have been summed up in one of those 5-slide infographics on Instagram, instead of a full 270 page book. Half the book I felt like he was just rambling to try and reach the word count - we’ve all been there in school James, can relate.Here are a few of the things that made this book ridiculous:-at one point in the book he recommends having someone, like your ASSISTANT, reset your social media passwords during the week so you stay focused (we all have assistants, amiright?!) OR you could pay your trainer $500 every time you miss a session to stay on track !!! (Clearly this book is targeted to a certain class of individuals)-he uses ridiculous examples and stories to introduce every point. Like I understand he’s trying to be relatable, but it gets exhausting. He talks in detail about Michael Phelps body shape and weight and how it makes him a good swimmer, how nice smelling soap cured disease in Karachi, a full points system explanation for scoring athlete’s performance and a random quote from the Tao Te Ching that didn’t fit what he was talking about at all. I really feel like he twisted the examples he used to try and perfectly fit his points, but then really didn’t make sense in the context of habits.-there’s a huge lack of science and research in this book. He constantly references other books that go in to detail and name drops studies and theories, but he does not elaborate. Most things come down to just his own experiences and thoughts, with nothing to back it up. There is nothing new or innovative that he brings up in this book, he really just sums up main ideas from other authors and researchers. And I would say that was fine if you are just looking for a quick, summarized rule book on habit building that gets to the point and provides steps rather than the science behind how habits work. But because he rambles on with a million unnecessary stories and thoughts, it’s not that either!!!-IT IS SO REPETITIVE. He provides a chapter summary after every chapter even though some are only like 5 pages long. And he is constantly saying “as I discussed back in chapter X..” and then goes on to repeat the whole thing! The bulk of what I took away from this book happened in the first 3 or so chapters, and then it just repeats itself.-his writing style comes off as condescending. He writes so much about himself and his amazing accomplishments, like getting thousands of followers every day, his many sport awards and his strict workouts and self discipline routines (which like is fine, good for you, but for people looking to start new habits it could come off as discouraging?)If you do decide to read this book after reading my mostly negative review, I recommend going into it with some planned habits you wish to begin/improve on. The book is written in very general terms so that it can be applied to any habit, which is good to target a broad audience, but it also means he says a whole lot of words without actually saying much. It’s kinda like reading a horoscope - it’s written general enough that it can apply to anyone depending on how you look at it, and is also mostly bullshit :P"

It got me thinking about whether or not habits are good to form. It caused a little cognitive dissonance and the pieces may never neatly settle.On one side - Helpful Habits which improve productivity, health, and any other goal we want to achieve. On the other side - Healthy Anti-Habits which help develop more mindfulness, neuroplasticity and fight against the rapidity of perceived time passage which increases with each year of life. Essentially, doing the same things the same way over time gets you into a rut and perceived time passes faster.The anti-habit crowd essentially says we need to break out of the zombie-mode of daily life for the health of our brain. * Neuroplasticity development by breaking patterns (e.g., choosing a different route to work every day or using a non-dominant hand) to rewire new pathways. This helps the brain to stay healthy, adaptable, and may ward against Alzheimer's and other insults.* Perceived time passage - We all feel time passing faster and faster as we age (Where has the summer gone?) Mitigate this by mindfulness, breaking patterns, and constantly doing new things.* Mindfulness - The fight for focus and awareness of the now. Maybe the least dissonant, but certainly somewhat contrary to automated behavior.These anti-habits are fundamentally at odds with habit formation which relies on repetitive zombie-brain behavior. I know there is probably a balance here, but most of us are slaves to our habits and struggle to incorporate healthy anti-habit behavior. I am beginning to see Atomic Habits as a way to make the best of the bad situation which is our modern lifestyle. TLDR: Modern life forces most of us into unhealthy, repetitive patterns, so we might as well use this to our advantage. Atomic Habits can definitely help."

This book is helping me to re-programme my habits to become a better version of myself. Life changes, goals change. Hence, we need to unlearn and grow new habits by means of effective systems.

What I particularly liked is that Clear does not give people the ""you need more discipline to succeed"" pep talk, but instructs to eliminate the need for self-discipline to protect resources. And it's true: Good luck trying to force yourself going to the gym three times a week for years. Clear counts on basically manipulating yourself so it does not feel like a chore anymore, and provides some tools to do that. That's the kind of self-foolery I can get behind.In a nutshell, ""Atomic Habits"" tells you to take small steps, but transform them into routines that you can then improve, to ponder the system you need to build in order to achieve your goals, and to ask how your goals relate to who you are. As someone who is generally a systemic thinker, already uses a habit tracker and who was raised to question who I want to be before making decisions, this book plays into what I can see myself doing with no hassle, and without wanting me to, you know, repeat mantras into a mirror, question my family history first, or dance naked in a forest.

Tác giả có đưa ra các cách thức để tạo động lực, xác định thói quen phù hợp với giá trị bạn đang hướng tới.(1) Về việc tạo động lực và duy trì thói quen tác giả đưa ra hai khái niệm:- Mục tiêu là kết quả mà bạn mong muốn đạt được. - Hệ thống là quá trình dẫn dắt bạn tới những kết quả đó.mọi người thất bại phần lớn với các thói quen là quá chú tâm vào mục tiêu hơn là dành thời gian xây dựng hệ thống. Đạt được mục tiêu chỉ là thay đổi mang tính nhất thời, nhưng khi cam kết với hệ thống thực hiện thói quen, bạn sẽ đạt được sự tiến bộ liên tục. ""Mục đích của việc hoạch định mục tiêu là nhằm chiến thắng cuộc chơi. Mục đích của việc xây dựng hệ thống là để tiếp tục cuộc chơi.""(2) Việc xác định thói quen phải phù hợp với đặc tính, căn tính bạn đang hướng tới. Căn tính ở đây là niềm tin, một giá trị mà bản thân trân trọng. Một thói quen mà đi ngược lại với giá trị bạn coi trọng thì sẽ dễ dàng thất bại. Hơn nữa, xây dựng thói quen là một cách củng cố căn tính hoặc làm mờ nhạt căn tính của bạn (trong trường hợp thói quen xung đột với căn tính). Việc này đòi hỏi bạn bạn phải làm một cách nghiêm túc.(3) Dựa trên quy luật thói quen, tác giả đưa ra các mẹo và thủ thuật để thực hiện các hành vi thói quen một cách dễ dàng và đều đặn:- 4 quy luật đó bao gồm:  + QL1. Dấu hiệu (hành vi đó trở nên hiển nhiên) + QL2. Khát khao (hành vi khiến bạn hứng thú làm thì dễ thực hiện) + QL3. Phản hồi (hành vi càng dễ dàng thì càng dễ thực hiện) + QL4. Phần thưởng (hành vi đem lại cảm giác thỏa mãn thì càng dễ thực hiện)- Áp dụng 4 quy luật của thói quen ở trên, tác giá áp dụng các bằng chứng tâm lý học để thực hành một thói quen mới một cách dễ dàng theo các mẫu, ví dụ: + Tôi sẽ thực hiện [CÔNG VIỆC] vào [THỜI GIAN] tại [ĐỊA ĐIỂM].

Bạn chỉ đang củng cố (tính thường xuyên) thói quen hiện tại chứ không cải thiện, phát triển chúng-> Bạn cần làm thực hiện thói quen tự động bằng một cách có Ý THỨC. Mình làm vì mình muốn làm chứ không phải làm vì thói quen: Cách giải quyết là nâng tầm thói quen lên một mức mới!- Mặt trái của thói quen cũ có thể giam hãm ta trong tư duy và hành động trước đó - nhưng thế giới thì không ngừng thay đổi. -> Cần thường xuyên xem lại các thói quen và niềm tin cũ có còn thực sự hữu ích không."

79,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22120546-seyedmahdi-hosseini,Rating 4 out of 5,در حوزه‌هایی مانند موفقیت، عادتها، مدیریت زمان، تمرکز و روابط اجتماعی، کتابهایی وجود دارند که بیشتر به تکنیکها می‌پردازند و از ذکر دلیل این تکنیکها پرهیز می‌کنند. گاهی این کتابها به کتابهای بازاری یا زرد معروف می‌شوند. (مانند کتابهای برایان تریسی) برخی از کتابها نیز وجود دارند که عمدتا به فلسفه‌ی موضوعات می‌پردازند و فرصتی برای بیان تکنیکها وجود ندارد. (مانند کتاب هوش هیجانی) معمولا نیز اینطور است که کتابهای تکنیکال، نکات نهایی و کاربردی چندین فصل از چندین کتاب را در یک کتاب خلاصه کرده‌اند و به نظرم حتی به عنوان جمع‌بندی و یکپارچه‌سازی مطالب چندین کتاب از چندین مبحث علمی جداگانه، لازم هستند و فواید زیادی دارند که جای بحث آن در اینجا نیست.اگر قبل از مطالعه‌ی کتابهای دسته‌ی اول (تکنیکال)، کتابهای دسته‌ی دوم (بنیادین) را مطالعه کرده باشیم، با درک بهتر دلیل وجودی آن تکنیکها، باورهایی نیز درخصوص تاثیر آنها بوجود می‌آید که اثربخشی‌شان را دوچندان می‌کند. همچنین درک بهتر آن باعث می‌شود فراموشی استفاده از تکنیکها نیز کمتر شود؛ چرا که بسیاری اوقات صرف مطالعه سلسله‌وار یک سری روش، بدون دانستن چرایی آن، شاید اثر چندانی نداشته باشد.کتاب «عادتهای اتمی»، کتابی بسیار خوب درباره عادتها است که تلاش کرده هر دو بخش فلسفه‌ی وجودی و تکنیکها را با هم پوشش دهد. گرچه این تلاش در بسیاری از مواقع منجر به خلاصه‌شدن هر دو بخش و ابتر ماندن آن شده است؛ اما می‌تواند برای کسانی که تمایل دارند به جای مطالعه‌ی چند کتاب، یک کتاب درباره‌ی تغییر و تثبیت عادتها مطالعه کنند، بسیار مفید باشد. با اینحال این را نیز درنظر داشته باشیم که برای فهم و رسوب بهتر مطالب گفته شده در کتاب «عادتهای اتمی» بهتر است مطالعات بنیادین دیگری نیز درباره محورهای گفته شده در کتاب داشته باشیم.

I won’t do the same thing, as I don’t believe I can add anything to them that they haven’t done already. I will say, however, that this is miles clear of any “self help” or “personal development” drivel that I have chanced across in the bookstores. The chapters are short, concise, and perfectly put. Clear takes full responsibility for any information that is presented poorly (not many things are). He cuts down the romanticizing, useless anecdotes, etc. to say you need to do A, which will lead you to B, resulting in C. He references all of his sources. This book is not a pamphlet which Clear uses to sell you on another subscription-based product of his – it is perfectly sufficient in and of itself. I will be recommending it to my clients in the coming years.Also, what a last name. If anyone was made to do this, huh?"

While reading, I realized there are many things we do unconsciously (at least I do) that can lead us to where we want to be. At times it can come quite naturally, some others we have to work on the process to achieve our goals."

Now that I’m done with it, I can see why it is so beloved and often suggested as a life-changer. This is one of the better self-help books I’ve read because it’s quite practical. I can’t stand books that spout impractical philosophy without offering concrete and realistic methods of implementation. Most of the tips here are sensible and easily manageable. The anecdotes accompanying every advice help reinforce the point. Clear’s four-way method on how to make/break habits sounds very doable. The neat chapter summaries help in a quick checklist of the executables if you ever need a quick recap.So it is going to change my habits from now on? Nope! And that’s partly because whatever he suggested is already something I do without even realising it. I’m a compulsive planner by nature and most of his tips rotate around planning your way to success. So, just as always, I’m the stubborn mule who doesn’t benefit from reading a self-help book while everyone else can see the wonders of its content.Recommended to lovers of this genre and those wanting to give this genre a try.***********************Join me on the Facebook group,

It had some great ideas. But there was nothing earth-shaking here. There was nothing I couldn't learn from a shorter Youtube video or TED Talk. And since I've written my own self-help book -- The Underground Novel: An Alternative Guide to Life After Graduation -- and that book essentially argues that most self-help books are a waste of time, a way of avoiding the Real of real-life desire, I have to ask whether reading self-help books is a bad habit. Something I need to rid myself of in order to move forward. As Tyler Durden, the character of Fight Club says, ""Self-improvement is masturbation."" The idea of self-improvement, too, that the perfect self can create our perfect dreams is a way of avoiding the messiness of real life and what it takes to reach real-life success. The randomness of life has a way of dirtying our ideal notions of effective selfhood. We can experience all the benefits of compounded 1 percent changes and still look foolish in the end. Books such as ""Candide"" and ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" are great antidotes -- a kind of silliness to counter the silliness of self-help. Even Captain Picard, the paragon of self-improvement himself, understood this and thus gave this advice to Data: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4A-M...So, today take a break from improving yourself. Be your imperfect self...allowing yourself this indulgence on occasion might be the best habit of all. "

I thought it was going to be far more interesting than it turned out to be, because Clear opens with an anecdote about how he got his face obliterated by a baseball bat when he was a kid. I was reading to follow him on this journey of recovery and relearning, but this was truly one of my least favorite self-help books ever. I'll be honest, I read self-help not because I feel a need to improve myself (I really don't), but because I'm fascinated with the industry. This book is full of fatphobia, classism, and ableism, and it falls into the most annoying category of self-help which is of the ""force yourself to fit a life that isn't right for you instead of forging a life that fits who you really are"" variety. I truly hate it when self-help places judgements on behaviors. It's ""bad"" to eat what you enjoy, it's ""good"" to eat a meal that makes you miserable. It's ""bad"" to be fat (it most certainly is not bad to be fat), it's ""bad"" to sleep in, it's ""bad"" to enjoy a weekend watching movies and resting, it's ""bad"" to be happy where you are in life and not subscribe to boundless ambition. It's ""good"" to force yourself into a potentially harmful workout routine, it's ""good"" to read business book that make you want to rip your eyes out, it's ""good"" to be promoted constantly, it's ""good"" to be rich (sure is, but it doesn't make you a better person), it's ""good"" to want your body fat to be at 10% (enjoy being dead I guess). And sure, repetition does help build good habits. Eliminating barriers helps build good habits. But let's make sure the habits are ones you actually want and not ones you think you need to be perceived as a good human. I have very personal reasons for disliking this book, but let me just say that if someone read this book and did everything it told them to do and was very faithful to this ideology, I would absolutely hate being around that person. I would do everything I can to never have to interact with this person ever. If you want to be a better person, discover who you really are, what makes you happy and brings you joy, and then pursue that. Or you could set your workout clothes out for you the night before so you wake up to crushing guilt. Also, this guy loves Dilbert a little too much."

110,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1363537-yevgeniy-brikman,Rating 4 out of 5,"A clear, practical guide to developing good habits. The information in this book is fairly solid and worth reading for most people. My only concern is whether the information is presented in a way that is effective: that is, after reading this book, what percentage of people will actually change their behavior? I suppose this is the ultimate question of all self-improvement books, but I found that this one in particular, while effective at organizing and presenting information, didn't do it in such a way that I was immediately motivated to act on it. In short, I found it to be an educational book, but not an inspirational one.However, an important note: before reading this book, I was already reasonably good at building good habits. For example, about 6 years ago, I got myself into the habit of taking notes whenever I read nonfiction, and after finishing a book, summarizing those notes on GoodReads as part of my review; in fact, that's what you're reading here right now! I've managed to keep this habit for years and have now written reviews and summaries for hundreds of other books. Oddly enough, it was this habit—writing the very notes you're reading now—that got me to act on some of the advice in Atomic Habits (namely: I'm starting a habit journal and focusing on slower progress in fitness). But if I didn't already have this habit, would this book have helped me make any changes in my life? I'm not sure.That said, it's still a useful read. Here are some of the key takeaways for me:1. Your life today is the sum of your habits.- ""Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. You get what you repeat.""- If you get your habits right, the rest will follow. Therefore, you should be more concerned with your trajectory than your current position.- The 4 stages of forming a habit are cue, craving, response, reward. The cue triggers your brain to initiate some action; the craving provides the motivation to take a specific action; the response is the action you actually take; and the reward is what you get in response for that action. For example, the cue might be a stressful day at work, which makes you crave a relief from all that anxiety, which leads to the response that you head outside and smoke, which gives you the reward of getting away from work and the relaxation you get from the cigarette. - If you want to create good habits, you need all 4 of those ingredients in sufficient qualities: you need something to trigger the habit, you need it to produce a strong enough craving to motivate you take act on that habit, the response must be easy enough that you actually do it, and the reward must be satisfying enough that you keep doing it. The inverse is also true: if you want to break a bad habit, you can do it by interfering with any of these 4 ingredients.2. Small habits add up to something big.- Small habits are like compound interest. If you keep investing, even just a little bit, over time, the returns are exponential.- The best way to form habits is typically to start small—so small, that it may seem inconsequential. To get yourself to exercise, you might start with just 5 minutes of exercise per day; to get yourself to write more, you might start with writing just 1 paragraph per day. Just about everyone can take these tiny first steps, and sticking with easy habits is, well, fairly easy. And while the initial habit mmight not have much effect, the important part is that it got you started.- To make progress, you need to continue making tiny tiny little steps forward: 1% improvements, like adding 1 more minute of exercise each week, or 1 more paragraph of writing. Again, taking small steps forward is fairly easy, but these tiny improvements can add up astonishingly fast. A 1% improvement each day may not seem like much, but it adds up to a ~37x improvement over the course of a year. Exponential progress is powerful.3. Exponential progress is hard to see, initially.- One of the trickiest things with forming habits around small steps and exponential progress is that in the early days, it's hard to see any effect at all, which can be very demotivating. E.g., You won't see much change in your body from just 5 minutes of exercise per day, and you won't become a famous writer with just 1 paragraph of writing per day.- However, even though you can't see it, those investments are making a difference. Think of an ice cube in a room that starts at 20 degrees and is slowly warming up. As the temperature goes to 21 degrees, 22, 23, etc, you initially see no changes in that ice cube whatsoever. And yet, progress is being made. It's only when you finally get to 30 degrees, 31, and 32 that, suddenly, a dramatic change is visible. Almost all the change is only visible at the end, but you couldn't have gotten there without investing all the energy in the beginning an middle. - Much of life works that way. That's why it's essential to form habits now and keep investing, even if it doesn't seem to be making a difference initially. The effect of compound interest is delayed. 4. Patience is essential.- Because progress is so hard to see, patience is an essential part of success. The media loves to tell sensational stories of overnight success, but the reality is that almost all great accomplishments take a long, long time. - In fact, small, incremental progress is typically more effective and sustainable than large jumps, even if you think you have the ability to make a large jump. For example, if you have a habit of weight lifting, and one day, you try to make a 30 pound jump in your squat, there's a chance you'll injure yourself, or even if you don't, make yourself exceptional sore, either of which can be a setback and even break your habit. If you instead stay patient and stick with much smaller increments—e.g., just a 1 pound increase from your last workout—you'll almost always succeed, the risk of injury is low, and over time, these small increments add up shockingly quickly, and you'll far surpass the person trying to do bigger jumps. 5. Focus on systems more than goals.- Much of the modern world is obsessed with setting and accomplishing goals. But it's far more important to focus on putting in place a system to achieve your goals than the goals themselves.- That's because, when life gets tough, you don't rise to the level of your goals; instead, you fall to the level of your systems. If you don't have a good system in place, you'll never accomplish your goals; but if you have a good system in place, then the score will take care of itself. Get the inputs right, and the outputs will work out.6. The best way to put a good system in place is to make it part of your identity.- If you want to form a new habit to accomplish some goal, instead of focusing on the goal itself, focus on becoming the type of person that can accomplish that goal.- Example: instead of focusing on trying to lose weight, become the type of person who never misses a workout. Make it part of your identity, and your own pride will help you turn it into a habit.- To make something part of your identity, you need to gradually show yourself evidence that that person is really you. For example, start with a small exercise habit (e.g., 5 minutes of exercise) that is easy to succeed at. Seeing yourself exercise every day will let you build up some evidence that you're the type of person who never misses a workout. You then gradually ramp the workouts up, and each time you succeed and get some exercise in, you'll see yourself more and more as the person who never misses a workout. You'll start telling others that. You'll start being that person. And once it's part of your identity, it becomes a much easier habit to maintain.- Note that this can be a double-edged sword. Bad habits can also come from some part of your identity. E.g., If you identify yourself as someone who is bad at math or someone who can't remember names, then because you've made those bad habits part of who you are, it'll be hard to change them. So be very careful with what you make part of your identity!7. Trigger new habits with existing ones. - Examples: when I have my first cup of coffee in the morning (existing habit), I will do 2 minutes of meditation (new habit); just before heading to lunch each day (existing habit), I will do 10 push-ups (new habit). - The existing habit becomes a trigger for your new one. By leveraging behaviors you already do, and especially behaviors you enjoy, you can make it easier to pick up new behaviors.- Note: try to be very specific when identifying the trigger. For example, ""do 2 minutes of meditation in the morning"" is not nearly as good as ""do 2 minutes of meditation when I have my first cup of coffee"", as ""in the morning"" is a vague time period that won't be nearly as effective of a trigger as ""first cup of coffee.""8. Make the habit satisfying.- Triggers can help you start doing a habit, but to reinforce that habit so you keep doing it over the long term, it needs to be satisfying in some way. Some habits are inherently satisfying (e.g., you might starting getting a ""runner's high"" once you start running), but for those that aren't, or where the satisfaction won't be visible until much later (e.g., after years of training), you'll want to deliberately add some sort of reward.- Example: each time you manage to go to the yoga studio and do a good hour of stretching, reward yourself with a tasty snack from their cafe. Your brain will then slowly associate Friday the reward of yoga with yummy food, and it'll become a fun outing, rather than a chore.9. The environment has a huge impact on your habits.- People who are good at creating new habits don't necessarily have better willpower than others; instead, they are just better at structuring their environment so they don't have to exercise their willpower in the first place. You should strive to design your world so that it's easy to do the right thing.- For example, if you walk into the kitchen, and there is a plate of cookies on the table, you might be tempted to eat one, even if you're not hungry. If you're trying to get into a habit of eating healthy, using your willpower to try to resist those cookies every single time you walk into the kitchen is going to be a losing battle. A far more effective technique is to get those cookies out of sight; or even better, not have them in the house in the first place. - It's also a good idea to try to tie each environment to exactly 1 habit, and to avoid mixing. For example, if you're trying to get into a healthy sleeping habit, don't watch TV or do work in the same place you sleep (i.e., your bed). Instead, create a separate environment for TV (e.g., your living room or your couch) and another separate environment for doing work (e.g., your office or your desk). That way, each time you're in an environment, it triggers one habit, and only one habit: e.g., I'm at my desk, so I'm doing work, or I'm at my bed, so I'll go to sleep.10. Tracking habits can help reinforce them.- Tracking your progress and making what you've accomplished more visible can be a powerful way to reinforce habits.- Example: a calendar or habit journal where you put an ""X"" every day you succeed at a habit (e.g., go to the gym or meditate). After a while, you'll see a long streak of X's, which is satisfying, as you get a visual representation of your progress (which, as you may remember from earlier, is hard to see, especially early on). Moreover, it reinforces the habit, as you'll be tempted to keep doing the habit just to avoid breaking your streak of ""X's"". - Example: get two jars, and put a bunch of paperclips in one of them. Each time you succeed at a habit, move a paperclip from the full jar to the empty one. Over time, as you do the habit more and more, the empty jar will fill up, giving you another great visual sense of progress. You may start doing the habit more and more just to fill up that jar.- Note: tracking your habits is yet another habit to develop, so there is a cost to this, but it's the type of habit you invest in once, and then it pays dividends when working on all your other habits.11. Never miss twice.- Eventually, everyone fails at their habits. You'll have a bad day, or get sick, or just screw up.- The key is not to give up just because you failed. Since all success takes a long time, a single failure along the way will likely have no measurable impact on the final outcome. So don't stress it, and immediately get back on track. The goal is not to be perfect, but to be consistent.- In other words, it's OK to miss once now and then, but never miss twice in a row."

I found it a lot more helpful and interesting than before. I still have trouble remembering everything it talked about and all advice given, but now I'm certain I will read a summary or return to it again because I found it to be of value. If it wouldn't be because of the very boring beginning (sorry, I don't care for the author's life story), I would give it more stars. Although short, it gives some decent advice. ---Previous review from September 2020 (3 Stars)It was very similar to other books of this type and although I thought it was alright while reading it, now, a couple of months later I don't remember a thing. I will probably reread it at some point, just because there's a big black hole in my brain regarding this book. It didn't change my life, unfortunately."

He was most eminently aggravated by this entire genre for being, as he used to like to say with poise: ""trash"". His sentiment regarding them seems to be pretty prevalent among many thinking people. I think there is a truth in the idea of seeing this genre as trashy, and a folly as well.While it certainty is the case that most books in this category are bereft of serious scholarship and deep thought, there are generally useful tidbits that can be gleaned regarding how to practically achieve a couple of your goals. Carnegie's advice may get you attacked by a mob, but in another context they may very well aid you into understanding people on a level that would never be mentioned in a psych 101 course. These books, are, in my view always practical. And on that note, I still read them even if at times their mediocre understanding of philosophy, science and history make my eyes roll back in my head.So? Atomic habits. Eh. This is a solid book, despite its lack of self awareness - as many people have come before clear and said the same thing in more articulate ways. A good resource for this is Maria popova's blog : https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/03.... She has been writing about these ideas prob before duhigg' s power of habit. In short, clear contends that one should start with smaller goals, rather than massive ambitions. ANd by doing life little by little. That being, changing our individual habits, we will find ourselves gaining more control over our lives. As it is in fact the case that we are - in a sense what we do - it therefore is more accurately expressed 'we are what we do habitually.' Change your habits - change your lifeClear states at the end that the architecture of habits are broken down to two phases. We then must learn about ourselves and recondition our behaviors. 1. The problem phase  1a. cue (find a trigger/learn old triggers)1b.craving (impulse to do thing after trigger)2. Solution phase2a. response (respond to trigger)2b reward (receive reward for doing thing)I would like to take this time at the end of the review to quote a small part of the text which I found stimulating by its silliness.""In 1936 psychologist Kurt Lewin write a simple equation that makes a powerful statement: Behavior is a function of the person in their environment, or B= f(p,e)"". Im fairly certain that a well seasoned researcher of psychology would never write this pseudo mathematical sentence. This was ok.

119,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16201418-ahmad-moshrif,Rating 4 out of 5,هذه المقالة كتبتها بعد إطلاعي على الكتاب:------ما تعلمته من وجود الروتين مؤخرًا – الجزء الأولamoshrif.comعندما باشرت بكتابة كتاب ثورة الفن: كيف يعمل الفنان وكيف يعمل الآخرون (٢٧ سنة آنذاك)، لم أتوقع أمرين. الأول: أن الكتاب سيلقى الاستحسان من قبل القُرّاء الكِرام للدرجة التي تجعلني أُقرر أن أمضي جزءً كبيرًا من مستقبلي مع حِرفة الكتابة، والأمر الثاني: هو كثرة السؤال والنقاش عن فصل واحد فقط تحدثت عنه في الكتاب: الروتين.كأي شاب آخر، أُعاني تحديًا في الحفاظ على رباط الجأش، والانضباط بشكلٍ عام في حياتي العملية، فالملهيات كثيرة جدًا، واهتماماتي الشخصية أكثر. ومثلي ومثل أي شابٍ آخر أيضًا أُحِب الحياة بكل تفاصيلها.عندما تشرّبت واقتنعت تمامًا بمفهوم أهمية وجود روتين يومي في حياة أي إنسان طموح أو فنّان (وبالتالي سوّقت له في كتاباتي)، أصبحت أستغرب كثرة السؤال عن هذا الفصل من قبل الآخرين، فما يعتاد عليه الإنسان في حياته أحيانًا سيبدو غريبًا عندما يسمعه بشكلٍ متكرر من أفواه الآخرين «أحقًا وجود الروتين مهم في هذه الحياة؟» «الروتين يا أخي مُمل!» أو.. «أنا لا أستطيع أن أعيش في روتين يومي، فالحياة تتطلب التجديد المستمر» وهذه الجُمل بالطبع تحمل داخلها استنكارًا غير معلن عن فكرة أهمية وجود الروتين اليومي المتكرر في حياة المُعلقين الأفاضل.وفي الحقيقة، كل التعليقات صحيحة إلى حدٍ بعيد. ولكن، عندما أتحدث عن الروتين، أقصد بشكلٍ مباشر الروتين اليومي الذي نختاره نحن لأنفسنا، وليس الروتين الذي يختارنا ويرمي بنا إلى الملل. مشكلة الروتين أنه يرتبط بالدرجة الأولى بأعمالنا والتي يغلب علينا فيها اقتناعنا بأنها أعمال يومية على عاتقنا (نقوم بها غصبًا عنّا، أو من أجل الحصول على راتب نهاية الشهر) أكثر منها اختيارية. فالأغلبية مع الأسف تذهب إلى عملٍ لا تُحبه كل يوم، وأصبحوا يبرمجون أنفسهم على هذا العمل، والبقية القليلة من وقت اليوم يُصبح عبارة عن منفذٍ للهروب والاسترخاء أكثر منه عن البحث عن الاهتمامات الحقيقية الأخرى.السؤال يجب أن يدور حول: ما هو الروتين الممتع الذي اختاره لنفسي في ظل الالتزامات العملية؟ وليس سؤال: كيف يجب أن تُقنعني أنني يجب أن ألتزِم بفِعل نفس الشيء كل يوم؟أحاول هذا الشهر تطبيق ما تعلمته من كتاب Atomic Habits للكاتب James Clear وهو الكتاب الذي يتحدث عن التركيز على تغيير وبناء عادات صغيرة جدًا حتى يُصبح الإنسان أكثر كفاءة في حياته وعمله. على كل حال، لفتني مفهومين في الكتاب الأول أن المشكلة في عادات الأشخاص السيئة ليست لسوئهم هم، إنما لسوء نظامهم اليومي، وعندما يحاول أي شخص أن يُغير شيئًا ما سيء في يومه، فيشجعه الكاتب على تغيير النظام الكامل عوضًا عن محاولة تغيير هذا الشيء أو هذه العادة باستخدام الإرادة. فالإرادة سرعان ما تضعُف، أما النظام فسيبقى نظام. سآتي لتفصيل هذه النقطة.أما المفهوم الثاني فهو أن هناك أربعة نقاط يجب أن تكون موجودة في كل عادة حسنة جديدة تُضيفها خلال يومك:اجعلها شديدة الوضوح.اجعلها مُغرية لكي تقوم بها يوميًا.اجعلها سهلة.يجب أن تُشعرك مباشرًة بالرضا.وشرحًا للنقطة الأولى وتعقيبًا على الثانية، فإنني وجدت أن الروتين لكي يستمر بعد خطوة «اختيار الروتين الأنسب لحياتنا» فإن إسقاط الأمور الأخرى عليه والتي تصُب في إحساس الرضا مطلب مهم.مثال: لا أحب شخصيًا الرياضات الفردية، فهي تُشعرني بملل حقيقي، رغم اقتناعي بأهمية الالتزام بالرياضة بشكل يومي. فقررت تنفيذ الأربعة نقاط في المفهوم الثاني.أصبحت أذهب إلي النادي يوميًا، ليس حبّا في الرياضة، إنما للجلوس على الدراجة لمدة نصف ساعة أو أكثر (ارتفعت لاحقًا إلى خمسة وأربعين دقيقة، والهدف المقبل ساعة ربما) وأمامي شاشة الآيباد مفتوح فيها كتابًا رائع أقرأه هذه الأيام على تطبيق Kindle. وهنا مُحصلة هذا الأمر:اجعلها شديدة الوضوح: ٣٠ دقيقة فقط على الدراجة أو على جهاز رياضي آخر.اجعلها مُغرية لكي تقوم بها يوميًا: أُحب القراءة جدًا، فأصبحت أرغم نفسي على الذهاب للنادي من أجل القراءة، وليس الرياضة بشكل مجرد.اجعلها سهلة: الدراجة أو آلة Elliptical تساعدني على القراءة (رغم الإرهاق الشديد الذي يُصاحب التمرين الثاني).يجب أن تُشعرك مباشرًة بالرضا: أربعين صفحة من القراءة إضافًة إلى نصف ساعة رياضة، أفضل من أي أمرٍ ��خر يُصرف فيه الوقت بصراحة.ولأكون منصفًا، هذا جزء لا يتجاوز الساعتين من يومي، وهو مختص بفقرة الرياضة اليومية، ومن المجدي أن أعِد القارئ الكريم بمحاولتي الجادّة بالالتزام، فيجب أن أكون مسؤولًا عمّا أقول، خصوصًا في نقطة ضعف سابقة لدي، كالرياضة.التحدي الآخر الذي أصبحت أواجهه، هو كيفية الوصول لأفضل طريقة أضمن فيها تناول أكل يومي يحمل الصفات التالية: صحي، لذيذ، عملي، لا يُضيع الوقت، رخيص، وذو جودة مقبولة. والأهم من هذا كله، أنني أستطيع الوصول إليه يوميًا وبسرعة، دون إعطاء فرصة للتفكير وسؤال: ماذا يجب علي أن آكل اليوم؟ لأن هذا السؤال سيفتح أفخاخًا عديدة للتعرض لأكل لا يتناسب مع المواصفات المطلوبة.ووجدت الحل.. بوفيه السلطة في مطعم «ستيك هاوس» في جدة، يبعد عن مكتبي أقل من خمسة دقائق بالسيارة، يملكون أفضل بوفيه سلطات وشوربة (يتضمن خيارات عديدة من البروتين أيضًا: دجاج، شوربة جيدة جدًا، بيض مسلوق، تونة. وأضافوا مؤخرًا: بروكلي، وزهرة، وبنجر، وزيتون) كل ذلك، يمكنك الحصول عليه إضافًة إلى مشروبي المفضل (آيس تي دون سكر) بـ ٣٥ ريال.أصبحت دون تفكير، أذهب إلى المطعم عندما أجوع (كل يوم)، أدخل مباشرًة إلى البوفيه قبل أن أجلس على الطاولة، أعبئ الصحن بالكامل، أجلس على الطاولة أطلب المشروب والحساب (كانوا يتفاجؤوا الموظفين بدايًة مني، حتى اعتادوا هذا الأمر) . كل ذلك، لا يأخذ مني أكثر من خمسة وثلاثين دقيقة (متضمنًة مشوار الذهاب والعودة من المكتب).تخيلت أنني سأقوم بهذا الأمر كل يوم، ووجدت أن مبلغ ٧٠٠ ريال في الشهر على وجبة بمثابة وجبتين في محل نظيف، استثمار لا بأس به. ناهيك عن وجبة العشاء في البيت بعدها بسبعة ساعات مع أُسرتي. أصبح كل من حولي يعلمون أين يجدوني وقت الغداء، أصبحت لا أفاوض ولا أفضل أي خيارات أخرى بصراحة. وعند أي مكالمة من صديق حول موضوع الغداء، إجابتي هي.. هي، كل يوم.تبقى لي التحدي الأكبر والذي أعاني منه منذ زمن، وهو النوم المبكر. أحب فكرة النوم المبكر لعدة أسباب لعل أهمها باختصار، أنني أصبحت استغل الساعة الأولى في الصباح الباكر (إن نمت واستيقظت مبكرًا) لأخذ دورة أونلاين مع جماعة Master Class فأنا في ذلك الوقت ذو عقل يقظ ودون إزعاجات، أساعد بعدها في إيقاظ بناتي وأنا في مزاج جيد لأوصلهم إلى المدرسة وقبلها يكون هناك أحيانًا مُتسع لساعة النادي، وبالطبع يُستكمل اليوم بمزاج جيد حتى وقت الكتابة لثلاثة أو أربع ساعات ابتداءً من ٨:٣٠ صباحًا. ومن ثم الانشغال في الأعمال الأخرى. وفي حالة عدم الاستيقاظ المبكر، تؤجل ساعة النادي إلى ما بعد الظهر، وهو شيء أقوم به حاليًا ولا أحبذه جدًا بصراحة، لكنه يظل أفضل من أي روتين سابق.شاهدي، أن جميع الخيارات في اليوم أصبحت ملك يدي ومُقررة مسبقًا. فهو بكل تفاصيله روتينًا جيد يشعرني بالرضا والإنجاز، وهناك جوانب أخرى مثيرة اكتشفتها أيضًا وتبنيتها في حياتي مؤخرًا، سأتحدث عنها في مقالتي القادمة.

Както повечето представители на хомо сапиенс и аз всекидневно се опитвам да си налагам по-продуктивен и здравословен начин на живот. Започвам да правя нещо, с идеята да го превърна в полезен навик, но твърде рядко начинанието е увенчано с успех. Също така се опитвам и да се отърва от редица вредни навици, но и при тях резултата обикновено е краткотраен.Ставам по-рано с идеята да си направя кафе и закуска, но ритуалът приключва с това, че закусвам обратно в леглото. Плащам си абонамент за спорт, но намирам оправдания ежеседмично да пропускам посещения.Не ме разбирайте грешно. Не съм открила книгата за мотивация и самопомощ, която ще промени ежедневието ми тотално за отрицателно кратко време. Като цяло рядко пристъпвам към такъв тип книги, тъй като ги намирам за неефективни и безсмислени в някои случаи.„Атомни навици“ на Джеймс Клиър успя да ме спечели с няколко основни неща.Това е една изключително добре структурирана книга, която не цели да те поучава и мотивира, а постепенно и подробно показва етапите на формиране на навика и дава практическа насока, как да го превърнем в положителен. Авторът е бивш спортист, който (подобно на това ревю) започва книгата си с честен и открит разказ за болезненото си възстановяване от травма в ученическите си години. Основната идея на Клиър е заложена в четири правила, върху които построява и книгата, за да разгледа подробно, подплътено с примери, какво са навиците, как да работят в наша полза или как да се откажем от тях, ако ни пречат.Направете го очевиден.Направете го привлекателен.Направете го лесен.Направете го приятен.На пръв прочит тези закони са повече от очевидни, защо ни е нужна цяла книга, за да ни го разясни. Защото, за да проработи системата на навика, трябва първо да бъде разбрана.Сравнявайки навиците с малките атомни частици, от които е изградена Вселената, Джеймс Клиър увлекателно разказва как те формират ежедневието ни повече, отколкото си представяне.Ние сме нашите навици, всяко действие и решение, води до навик. „Навиците представляват тласкан от допамина кръговрат на обратна връзка.“Навикът е много повече от всекидневно повтарящо се действие, последствията от нeго ни формират като личности и всъщност създават образа, който имаме пред обществото. Затова е важно да определяме средата, която да провокира полезни навици.„Вашите навици са съвременно удовлетворяване на древни желания. Нови версии на старите пороци.“Отказването от навици, които не са ни полезни е дълъг и некомфортен процес. Джеймс Клиър не крие това, но също така и не обещава бързи резултати. Промяната се корени в самия процес на навика, а не в очакването на мотивиращата цел. Щом навикът се превърне в нещо приятно, или неприятно, автоматично става много по-лесно да се връщаме/откъсваме от него.В края на всяка глава, авторът предлага кратко резюме на основните идеи представени в нея, както и множество таблици и графики за по-лесното им илюстриране. Това ми допадна доста, като вид преговор на вече прочетеното, също и като маркер за най-ключовото в главата.Уверено и интригуващо „Атомни навици“ разказва за практичен и удобен подход, като подобно на навика го разглежда поетапно в различен контекст. Така в края на книгата сам започнеш да пренареждаш средата, за да започнеш да правиш нещо, което искаш. Или да записваш стъпките, които трябва да опростят неприятeн навик, за да стана ежедневие.Не мога да кажа още, че книгата ми е помогнала да организирам ежедневието си. Затова е необходимо време, както и всички идеи от такъв тип, ефективният и бърз резултат е оксиморон.Но определено мога да заявя, че „Атомни навици“ се чете леко, дава полезни примери, не претендира с патос и поука, и всъщност е една доста забавна и практична книга, която ти дава насока и идея. Останалото зависи само от теб."

Books like this are beach reads for her.I didn't realize it would be like graduate school all over again when I borrowed ""Atomic Habits"". I have a half-filled notebook as proof. It was a really good read and I'm not a huge non-fic reader. It wasn't easy but it's quite satisfying when you're done. Again, kind of like school.Mr. James Clear's approach is friendly, positive, level-headed, and his claims are backed up not only with personal experience but also with science and math. It's probably why it felt like studying. Lol.Here are some of the gems I took note of. I took a lot but I will share some of my most favorite ones. ""The quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits.""""The only way I made progress-the only choice I had-was to start small.""""

128,no user info,Rating 1 out of 5,"Dear Mile (yes, no future needed here because you will never re-read this book again),This douche makes some valid points on habits, yes. Points that you can also google without having to pay $18.00 for a kindle ebook. That's even more outrageous than the amount of smoke this guy blows up his own ass. First off, you're only paying for roughly 60% of a book here. (Can you imagine the rant if you had to read 100% of this douche canoe's ideas?) The rest is definitions and citations. As if that wasn't apparent in the way every chapter was started. The most evident thing of habits in this book is starting off almost every chapter with a history lesson or a bedtime story. Followed by some more definitions that lead to a miniscule blip of how to form habits. And repeat.Now below is a summary of google's simplified version of creating good habits:-start small.-make it specific and measurable-go public-get help-take small stepsIt's like the author saw this and was like ""if I change my identity to a writer with simple ""habits"" and just copy and paste this shit, I'll be a success. Don't believe me? See his version below:-start small - James talks about starting with a 1% change each day-make it specific and measurable - Set a goal that's achievable and in your field of capability-go public - Make it known so that if you fail, there's punishment (in the form of your friend's judgement)-get help - Get a partner so they can once again shit on you when you fail-take small steps - watch an ice cube melt. LolDon't get me wrong, changing your habits is hard but this guy talks about a whole identity change. What!? It takes a certain type of individual to be able to change themselves completely. Obviously, I'm awesome but I can't suddenly identify as a toaster. Now some things that make me think this guy is a colossal douche? ""Getting in shape provides dating prospects."" I'll just let that comment speak for itself. Some habits that he identified just seemed ridiculous. Like walking into a dark room. Turning on the light is a habit. Sure, sure. Maybe I just don't want to walk into a goddamn piece of furniture? Ever think of that?How about the fact that habits are imprinted in our brains and with ""constant resistance you can succeed."" Try telling that to a cheese addict. Punish yourself when you eat cheese and resist it for the rest of your life. You'll succeed in no time. You'll just be this miserable version of yourself. Yay!*10 minutes later*""Are you still typing man?"" As my friend Sheri mentioned, I'm rambling. That's what happens when you want 40% of your money back for an unfinished product. (Let's be real, I want 100% of my money back + emotional compensation)Safe to say the only thing this book did was solidify my habit of never buying self help books.Sincerely,(Is signing off considered a habit?)Mile"

Atomic Habits has a lot of different take aways though and if you are only going to read One self help books I would highly recommend this be that one, if you are looking to improve or change your lifestyle.

""You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.""

There are so many great quotes throughout the book and helpful tips. You can have a really strong willpower happening for you but if the system you are using isn't easy and fits somewhere into your current routine, you have set yourself up for failure. He gives some great examples of how you can make it easy and build into a new pattern.There are so many great ideas and suggestions and maybe even some big epiphanies to be had on why some of the changes you tried to do in your life have failed before. Sometimes we are so focused on the end goal, we don't stop to appreciate the steps, the journey and the progress. Everything to be happy is set upon the result but not on the journey to get to the result.

“When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running.”

I very much enjoyed the structure of both the book and suggestions on the ways to use the advice in the book. We can all be so hard on ourselves that we forget to celebrate the small achievements and accomplishments in our journey. The book shows you haw to identify those in your system and be happy along your journey and not just when your make it to the end of your goal, which lets face it is hard to do if it is in reality something that is going to take a year to or so to accomplish.Probably one of the best self help books I've read along with The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life. Very quick read and perfect for this time of year when people are thinking about making resolutions for the new year. Help set yourself up for success by understanding what system you need to put into place to help raise probability you can achieve your goals.

“Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress.”

137,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60057377-stephen-lubin,Rating 5 out of 5,"8/10Atomic Habits is a useful book. It’s a practical guide to identifying and changing your habits. It’s something you can actually put into practice in your life. I think that all of the concepts in the book are good and useful to know but some of the action points I think are slightly oversimplified. If you take the action points in some chapters and modify them to your specific situation you can still apply most of them but you do have to do some critical thinking with the material. I like that the book is simple and straightforward. James Clear doesn’t bog you down with a lot of conceptual material. He starts each chapter with an example (some are better than others), gives you the concept plainly, and then gives you concrete actions to apply the concept in real life. It’s a nice formula. Each chapter is roughly 15-20min.This book is worth reading. It’s easy to apply the knowledge and action steps. Even if it doesn’t completely change your behavior, it will make you more aware of yourself. It provides a good lens that you can use to view yourself and others. I would recommend it to anyone who is trying to really set an airtight routine. If you follow the book you can definitely make something a habit. I’m a fan of James Clear. I have read his newsletter for about 2yrs now. His newsletter is one of the best I’ve read because it’s interesting and well researched and always has some take away for me. His book is really an expansion on a lot of things he’s covered in his newsletter. There are some chapters that I was already very familiar with because I had read his previous material on it. This doesn’t detract from the book. He expands on most things he’s written about before. The book is laid out like a road map and builds upon itself, which is something you don’t really get from the newsletter. The intro is pretty graphic. It’s about a personal injury the author has faced. I recommend being prepared for that. Once you get through that it’s all good. "

Тази година посегнах към „Атомни навици“ от Джеймс Клиър – книга, която казва неща, които знаем, но по систематизиран начин и с доста примери. Както хората са казали, за да започнеш нещо е нужна една крачка, след нея още една и така до целта. Клиър ни показва нагледно как чрез система от малки навици, които поддържаме постоянно, можем да променим и подобрим начина си на живот. „Атомни навици“ за мен беше полезна, но да си призная малко ме депресира, защото установих, че искам да променя толкова много неща в ежедневието и в себе си, че дори не знам откъде да започна."

Y me parece una lectura acertada ya que todo lo que propone es posible y siempre deja en claro que los ejemplos existosos son gracias al esfuerzo y que nada tiene que ver la suerte ni el destino.Las 4 leyes que contienen son pequeñas y podrían resumirse en una frase de la serie Bojack Horseman: ""Hacerlo es fácil, hacerlo todos los días, es lo difícil""Lo mejor del libro definitivamente en la sencillez con la que está escrito. Sobre todo la forma en que habla directamente de cómo abordar un problema y la narrativa del siglo XXI frente a ellos. (Problemas como bajar de peso, ahorrar, cambiar hábitos molestos)Yo entré a este libro buscando bajar de peso y hacer ejercicio, ya que era necesario generar esto hábitos en ese momento (por cuestiones de salud) y a medida que lo leía, me daba cuenta de que es sencillo, sí. Pero es difícil mantenerse. No sabía valorar los aciertos y cuestionar los fracasos. Ahora puedo decir que hago más actividad física y he bajado 7 kilos cambiando mi alimentación, gracias a una frase que está en el primer capítulo: ""¿Qué haría una persona sana?"" Y aunque esa frase es pequeña, hace reflexionar sobre la siguiente acción y cambia el ritmo de vida.Lo no tan bueno del libro es que literal es un ""todo depende de ti"" eso quiere decir que si no hay voluntad, no hay nada.En resumen, recomiendo este libro para todos los amantes de la autoayuda.

The concepts are really simple and straight-forward, yet profound in their ability to change lives. I plan to purchase it in eyeball-reading form so I can actually put these concepts into action since doing so in the car on my way to and from work doesn't really make sense.In my experience and with some of my recent reads on addiction and dealing with many addicts in my line of work, I can say that these concepts really make sense. I've worked with people breaking alcohol addiction and some of the same practices were used that are described here, such as brushing your teeth or drinking grapefruit juice when you have a craving. Atomic Habits doesn't tell you to brush your teeth or drink juice, but tells about the cues that cause us to fall back into habits.Habits govern so much that we don't even realize. I hear a pop of a can and suddenly I'm looking to grab a Dr. Pepper and that's just one of so many things I realize in my own life let alone those that I don't realize.Self-examination is tough, but I would highly recommend reading this book, especially if you are stuck in a rut and can't figure your way out. But even if not, it's good to take a look at how habits are affecting your day-to-day life. This quote is quite profound and describes, I believe, what I'm saying: “Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity.”4.5 out of 5 stars (highly recommended)"

And another? And another? At some point, you will have to admit that no one can be rich unless one coin can make him or her so. We can say the same about atomic habits.

Some quotes:
""And when you envision what you want your life to be like, it is easy to see the value in taking actions with long-term benefits. We all want better lives for our future selves. However, when the moment of decision arrives, instant gratification usually wins. You are no longer making a choice for Future You, who dreams of being fitter or wealthier or happier. You are choosing for Present You, who wants to be full, pampered, and entertained. As a general rule, the more immediate pleasure you get from an action, the more strongly you should question whether it aligns with your long-term goals."" 🤍✨""You don't have to build the habits everyone tells you to build. Choose the habit that best suits you, not the one that is most popular."" 🤍✨""Small habits don't add up. They compound.That's the power of atomic habits. Tiny changes. Remarkable results."" 🤍✨"

Atomic habits is that book that everyone should read and imbibe rather than review. Reason - it is a very practical way to approach improvement by creating tiny changes. While i myself have driven multiple kaizen programs across organisations - it is very different when it comes to your own habits due to 2 reasons - self awareness and motivation. And hence i found this book filled with oodles of sense - the simple, practical approach to drive 1% improvement every day.I had already read Charles Duhiggs power of habit that details out the theory of habit formation. Here James Clear brings it to application by engineering stimuli/cues, redesigning environment and tools to keep you on track.This is one of the books made to gift to people and appear non condescending (as against something like 'how to win friends'). Of course i read it after almost the entire world had read it. A useful and recommended book."
162,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27203016-michelle-curie,Rating 2 out of 5,"If anything, I'm a creature of habits. Reading this has made me realise this even more than I was aware of already. But I believe that there are different goals and ways to frame the practice of habits and I'm not the biggest fan of this approach. Atomic Habits is pretty much what the title suggests: James Clear is a regular dude who just spend a lot of time thinking about habits and how to phrase a generally applicable formula to the establishing of good and breaking of bad ones. He does it in an approachable, easy-to-read-and-understand way that's typical popular science and catchy at the same time. As he describes himself:""The fields I draw on – biology, neuroscience, philosophy, psychology, and more – have been around for many years. What I offer you is a synthesis of the best ideas smart people figured out a long time ago as well as the most compelling discoveries scientists have made recently. My contribution, I hope, is to find the ideas that matter most and connect them in a way that is highly actionable.""I liked the idea that a little goes a long way. He hypothesises that there's a compound effect to habits: spending just a small amount of time doing something is going to add up. It's what makes them atomic: small things can create powerful changes. The implications reminded me of what Elizabeth Gilbert preached in Big Magic, which I really enjoyed. It motivates you to start something and not let perfectionism, pessimism or the fear of failing get in your way of taking action. Speaking of taking action. The four rules Clear identified to building a habit are to make it obvious; make it attractive; make it easy and make it satisfying. The way he explains his points are precise and specific, which I think is great for people who actually need a litte push of motivation. One might argue that it gets repetitive at some point, but I think it's fine to really drill this into people's head if you want to get them going. So what's my problem? I kinda hate that to Clear, habits are all about self-perfecting. He keeps talking about maximising your potential and achieving elite levels of performance. I wish the focus didn't lie on becoming exceptional so much than on just sort of being healthy and happy. He's also sort of forcing his idea of what's a good and a bad habit is onto the reader: weighing yourself every morning is considered good for example, so is reading a book, but playing a video game is bad. It certainly made me appreciate books like Jenny Odell's How to Do Nothing more in which not everything is just about expanding and growing. Merely sustaining is underrated in our society. This also does run into the problems popular science typically does. Each chapter starts out with an anecdote of someone successful or famous. These stories were entertaining, but occasionally felt like Clear was really trying to bend them in a way that made his narrative fit. He speaks about the woman grand master Judit Polgár (considered the best female chess player of all times) for example and how her parents made chess very accessible and present in their household from super early on. He utilises that story to prove his point of how making something part your identity can increase your will and capability to be good at it, but I'm sorry, that's really simplifying."

Có thể do mình đã có tìm hiểu về chủ đề này rồi nên mình thấy quyển này cũng không có gì quá đột phá. Nhưng quyển này có rất nhiều điểm tốt và sau khi đọc xong mình cảm thấy thực sự được truyền động lực, nên xem như quyển này đã hoàn thành vai trò.Điểm hay đầu tiên là quyển này tên ""Atomic Habits"" chứ không phải là ""Habits"" - trong sách tác giả luôn nh���n mạnh chữ ATOMIC. Một quan điểm rất hay quyển này muốn nhấn mạnh: Thói quen là một quá trình mà phải bắt đầu từ những bước nhỏ nhất (atomic habit) rồi mới tăng mức độ lên dần. Việc này giúp những người muốn thay đổi thói quen đỡ căng thẳng, dễ nản lòng do họ có suy nghĩ sai lầm là muốn thay đổi thói quen thì mình phải thay đổi toàn bộ lối sống chỉ qua một đêm. Điểm hay thứ hai, như nhiều review đã nói, quyển này được viết ra cho đối tượng phổ thông. Các kiến thức trong này được viết ra rất dễ hiểu, có cụ thể từng bước, ví dụ để ai đọc cũng có thể tự mình thực hiện được. Các kiến thức dù mình đã biết nhưng cũng có một sốchỗ tác giả nhìn nhận lại vấn đề theo một cách khác làm mình rất thú vị, nghiệm ra được một số điều.Điều mình không thích ở quyển này là tác giả lại theo mô típ của các sách self help trước khi nêu quá nhiều ví dụ trong khi ai cũng hiểu hết rồi, làm sách này dài dòng hơn cần thiết. Với lại do độ nổi tiếng của quyển này nên mình đã mong nó đột phá hơn một chút.Một điều nữa là tác giả khá tập trung trình bày về cách tạo lập thói quen. Mình đã mong tác giả nói nhiều hơn về việc sau khi tạo lập thói quen xong rồi thì làm sao để giữ gìn nó. Do câu quote quen thuộc của quyển này là ""mỗi ngày tăng lên 1%"" nhưng không thấy tác giả nói quá nhiều về việc đó, chỉ nói về việc ngay ban đầu, làm sao để hình thành thói quen.Nói chung quyển này giống như một người thầy có tâm vậy. Những kiến thức dù không có gì quá đột phá nhưng được trình bày rõ ràng, mạch lạc, chỉ dẫn tận tình, đặc biệt nhất là truyền cảm hứng cho người đọc thực sự thay đổi thói quen chứ không phải chỉ đọc xong quyển habit này rồi lại lôi quyển habit khác ra đọc để trì hoãn làm việc :)))"

“Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity.”
I've read a number of books on how to form positive habits, including The Power of Habit by Duhigg, and in my opinion, Atomic Habits by Clear ranks as the best. It covers what could be considered as ideas of common sense, but presents these ideas in a well organized and logical way. Basic concepts include the notion that you should focus not on the end goal, but rather forming the habit which will ultimately get you to your goal. The author notes that we as a society are too absorbed by short-term gratification; bad habits (like smoking or overeating) satisfy in the near term, but take us away from the person we really want to be in the long-run. Good habits, however, often involve short-term discomfort (going to the gym), but move us toward our goals over time. Other points: keep habits small at first, and again forget about short-term progress. For example, it doesn't matter how hard you work out, just so long as you go to the gym; avoid finding excuses not to go. Another: make bad habits more difficult; remove the batteries from your TV remote if you want to stop watching the tube. Also, employ the power of habit tracking for positive reinforcement. Personally, I love the HabitBull app on my phone which I use to track habits.The book shares numerous great tips. My only gripe is that the author has a habit (sorry) of stating repeatedly that more info is available on his website. After 20+ times it became annoying."
166,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1953609-lisa,Rating 3 out of 5,"If you are new to the study of habits or are looking for some easy-to-follow guidance/motivation on increasing the effectiveness of your current habits, I highly recommend this book. Small, well-designed habits can pay huge dividends over time, and the author shares helpful guidance on how we should be thinking about habits and how they impact our behavior. Some examples of the guidance include: you should focus more on building systems rather than setting goals; habits should be invisible and easy to follow; and the language you use while talking about your behavior changes and how it relates to your identity is very important. As I’ve found with a lot of self-help books, the author tends to rely more on anecdotes and self-testing rather than research, but the anecdotes are relevant and help reinforce the effectiveness of the strategies.However, if you’re already well-versed in the common habit strategies, you can probably skip this one. I listen to a lot of podcasts and read a lot of leadership articles, so I’m already really familiar with the common habit-forming strategies like habit stacking, temptation bundling, and the two-minute rule. The book is a comprehensive summary of effective habit strategies, but if you’ve already read a book or two on the topic or regularly listen to any popular leadership/management podcasts, you’re not going to find much new content in this book."

Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.
I think you all know this book or at least have heard something related to it. It has achieved great success. Now I understand why. You know what happens with self-help books or personal development books: sometimes we are reluctant to read them because we think: ""Oh, I already know those things; no need to read about them."" Wrong! I think we all should give an opportunity to this book as it has a very valuable knowledge.""Be the designer of your world and not merely the consumer of it""""The secret to getting results that last is to never stop making improvements. It's remarkable wht you can build if you just don't stop. It's remarkable the business you can build if you don't stop working. It's remarkable the body you can build if you don't stop training. It's remarkable the knowledge you can build if you don't stop learning. It's remarkable the fortune you can build if you don't stop saving. It's remarkable the friendships you can build if you don't stop caring. Small habits don't add up, they compound. That's the power of atomic habits. Tiny changes. Remarkable results."""

About the book:If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Here, you'll get a proven system that can take you to new heights.Clear is known for his ability to distill complex topics into simple behaviors that can be easily applied to daily life and work. Here, he draws on the most proven ideas from biology, psychology, and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide for making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible. Along the way, readers will be inspired and entertained with true stories from Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving physicians, and star comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of their field.Learn how to:- Make time for new habits (even when life gets crazy);- Overcome a lack of motivation and willpower;- Design your environment to make success easier;- Get back on track when you fall off course;...and much more.Release Date: October 16th, 2018Genre: Self HelpPages: 319Rating: ⭐ What I Liked:	1. Book with words What I Didn't Like:	1. Don't like the author	2. Generic & fluffy	3. Repetitive	4. Annoying links to everything mentioned	5. Felt like author was selling me moreOverall Thoughts: I randomly came across this book though I don't remember where, but I thought it might help me procrastinate less. Unfortunately, there's an 8 year wait at my library and online libraries - well forget about it I'd be dead and buried before getting a copy. So, the only way I could even get a copy was in CD form. Yeah I am one of those dinosaurs that has a CD player in my car. I put the CD in and was forced to listen to the slowest and driest voice ever tell me the most boring stuff about baseball. I get trying to tell your story before you jump into the meat of the book but my god I was bored. The author comes off very full of himself. He tells us how grand and wonderful he was at baseball, but then throws in that none of that matters because he didn't play professionally. Well dude why are you telling us your stupid stats then? After that we get a chapter on ""Why I wrote this book."" He does not in fact tell us why at all. He proceeds to tell us how many subscriptions he has via email and more weird numbers describing his popularity, but not once does he say why he decided to even start the email subscription. It all just came off like he was trying to sell us on the book and his habits. It all felt very snake oil salesman to me.I swear to God why do we care about the cycling team. Why is this dude just keep quoting everything from sports?? Maybe I am the odd one because in the book he mentions that people have patterns and they want to do them over and over, but my problem is that I don't have a set pattern. I'm very random. But then he comes back around and says that people need patterns to do over and over. Final Thoughts: The book just felt a collection of other people's studies and conclusions. Nothing felt genuine or like it was something he came up on his own. This is all stuff I've been hearing about for years. It feels like common knowledge. Yeah, hanging out with positive people would make you do positive things and vice versa. This book didn't feel like it was trying to help but more about trying to just sell me more things. The author constantly tells you to go to his blog for more information. This is a 300 page book so how about you just tell me here. Maybe this book could work for some people but I just could not get over the feeling that he was repeating the same recycled stuff he's heard along the way. There's even a part where he says someone showed him a book and then he decided to put that in his ""course.""I did dnf this book because to me it just made me tone out and not care. I need a book to show me rather than tell me how something works. I was half way through the book and I just kept feeling like I was being talked at.

181,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76507338-saadia-b,Rating 4 out of 5,"A habit is a routine or behavior that is performed regularly - and in many cases, automatically. The aggregation of marginal gains - the philosophy of searching for a tiny margin of improvement in everything you do. Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Success is the product of daily habits - not once in a lifetime transformations. Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change. Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.Habits are like the atoms of our lives. Each one is a fundamental unit that contributes to your overall improvement. Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is what you believe. With outcome-based habits, the focus is on what you want to achieve. With identity-based habits, the focus is on who you wish to become. Your behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity. What you do is an indication of the type of person you believe that you are - either consciously or unconsciously. The more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behavior. Habit formation is incredibly useful because the conscious mind is the bottleneck of the brain. It can only pay attention to one problem at a time. As a result, your brain is always working to preserve your conscious attention for whatever task is most essential. Habits reduce cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so that you can allocate your attention to other tasks. Habit stacking works best when the use is highly specific and immediately actionable. We like to think that we are in control. The truth is that many of the actions we take each day are shaped not by purposeful drive and choice but by the most obvious option. Bad habits are autocatalytic: the process feeds itself. They foster the feelings they try to numb. You can break a habit, but you're unlikely to forget it. Once the mental grooves of habit have been caused into your brain they are nearly impossible to remove entirely - even if they go unused for quite a while. Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. Every behavior that is highly habit forming is associated with higher levels of dopamine. Habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes progressively more automatic through repetition.Automaticity is the ability to perform a behavior without thinking about each step, which occurs when the nonconscious mind takes over. Habits are like the entrance ramp to a highway. They led you down a path and before you know it, you've speeding toward the next behavior. It seems to be easier to continue what you are already doing than to start doing something different. A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that control your actions in the future. It is a way to look in future behavior, bind you to good habits and restrict you from bad ones. Measurement is only useful when it guides you and adds context to a larger picture, not when it consumes you. A habit contract is a verbal or written agreement in which you state your commitment to a particular habit and the punishment that will occur if you don't follow through. Then you find one or two people to act as your accountability partners and sign off on the contract with you. Habits are easier to perform and more satisfying to stick with when they align with your natural inclinations and abilities. Flow is the mental state you enter when you are so focused on the task at hand that the rest of world fades away. The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way. Professionals know what is important to them and work toward it with purpose; amateurs get pulled off course by the urgencies of life. The only way to become excellent is to be endlessly fascinated by doing the same thing over and over. Mastery is the process of narrowing your focus to a tiny element of success, repeating it until you have internalized the skill and then using this new habit as the foundation to advance to the next frontier of your development. When you cling too tightly to one identity, you become brittle. Lose that one thing and you lose yourself. The key to mitigating these losses of identity is to redefine yourself such that you get to keep important aspects of your identity even if your particular role changes. Habits deliver numerous benefits but the downside is that they can lock us into our previous patterns of thinking and acting even when the world is shifting around us.

184,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61775919-pawarut-jongsirirag,Rating 4 out of 5,ผมว่าหลายคนน่าจะมีประสบการณ์ทำนองว่า อยากลดน้ำหนัก เลยคิดจะไปออกกำลังกายบ้าง ลดอาหารบ้าง ซึ่งสุดท้ายแล้วได้ทำไปสองสามรอบแล้วก็เลิกไป หรือถ้าอย่างเศร้าเลยคือได้แค่คิดแต่ยังไม่ได้แม้เริ่มลงมือทำ ก็ล้มเลิกไปก่อนแล้ว เพราะอะไร ทำไมเราถึงล้มเลิกไปก่อน ทำไมเราถึงเปลี่ยนนิสัยของเราไม่ได้ หนังสือเล่มนี้จะบอกเราว่า เพราะคุณใช้วิธีที่ผิดนะซิ มันจึงไม่สามารถแก้ไขได้ แล้ววิธีที่ถูกละเป็นยังไง มาลองดูกันครับAtomic Habit เล่าถึงวิธีการที่เราจะเปลี่ยนแปลงนิสัยของเราให้ได้อย่างมีประสิทธิภาพ ประกอบไปด้วยการปรับ 1 แนวคิด และวิธีการปรับเปลี่ยนนิสัยผ่าน 4 หลักการสำคัญในส่วนของการปรับเปลี่ยนแนวคิดนั้น หนังสือบอกเราว่านิสัยนั้นสามารถปรับแก้ได้ โดยการแก้ไขเพียงเล็กน้อย แต่ต่อเนื่อง คนเรามักฝังใจว่าจะแก้ไขนิสัยนั้นต้องเล่นใหญ่ ต้องเห็นผลในเร็ววัน ซึ่ง ผู้เขียนบอกว่าทำแบบนี้จะทำให้คุณทำได้ไม่นานหรอกครับ เพราะคุณรู้สึกว่ามันไม่น่าทำและยากเกินไป (จะไปเกี่ยวข้องกับหลักการแก้ไข 4 อย่างด้วยเช่นกัน) ดังนั้นแนวคิดที่คุณควรตั้งแต่แรก คือ ลองปรับไปทีละนิดละหน่อย แต่ทำไปอย่างต่อเนื่อง จากสิ่งเล็กน้อยจะก่อให้เกิดผลลัพธ์ที่ยิ่งใหญ่ในภายหลังเองครับเมื่อแนวคิดมาถูกทางแล้ว ก็มาถึง “วิธี” ในการปรับเปลี่ยนนิสัยของเรา หนังสือไม่ได้บอกวิธีโดยตรงมาให้เราทำนะครับ แต่นำเสนอแนวคิด 4 หลัก เพื่อให้นำไปปรับใช้กับตัวเราเอง โดย 4 หลักดังกล่าวนี้ คือ  1.ทำให้ชัดเจน การแก้ไขนิสัย คุณจะต้องลงรายละเอียดให้ชัด ว่าจะทำอะไรที่ไหนเมื่อไหร่อย่างไร ไม่ใช่แค่คิดกว้างๆว่า อยากออกกำลังกายนะ แต่ให้คิดเลยว่า จะออกที่ไหน เวลาไหน อย่างไรให้ชัดเจน ความชัดเจนจะทำให้เรารู้สึกว่าต้องทำมากกว่าแค่การคิดอย่างกว้างๆครับ 2.ทำให้น่าดึงดูดใจ เมื่อเราวางแผนแ���้ว แต่การจะทำหรือไม่ ง่ายๆเลยครับ เราควรทำให้มันน่าดึงดูด สร้างปัจจัยแวดล้อมให้ดึงดูดคุณไปทำสิ่งเหล่านั้น เช่น อยากอ่านหนังสือให้ได้ทุกวัน ก็ลองเอาหนังสือมาวางใกล้ๆตัวตลอดเวลา ไม่ใช่ว่าอยากอ่าน แต่เอาหนังสือเก็บลงกล่องไม่เคยเห็นเลยตลอดวัน ก็จะทำให้ลดแน้มโน้มในการทำลงไปได้ครับ 3.ทำให้เป็นเรื่องง่าย ในข้อนี้น่าจะเป็นข้อที่เราอาจนึกไม่ถึงกัน ในการปรับนิสัย เรามักนึกว่าต้องเล่นใหญ่เพื่อให้เห็นผลลัพท์ชัดเจน เช่น อยากออกกำลังกาย ก็จัดเต็มตั้งแต่รอบแรก ทำเสร็จนี่ฟินเลยนะ แต่รู้สึกไม่อยากทำต่อแล้ว เพราะรู้สึกว่ามันยากลำบากเหลือเกิน แล้วก็ล้มเลิกไป ดังนั้นในการปรับเปลี่ยน เราควรทำให้กิจกรรมเหล่านั้นง่ายเข้าไว้เพื่อให้เราไม่รู้สึกว่าลำบากในการทำ เช่น ออกกำลังง่ายๆแค่วันละ 5 นาทีก่อน หรือ ถ้าอยากควบคุมอาหาร ก็แค่ไม่สั่งพิเศษ สั่งแค่ธรรมดาก่อน แทนที่จะลดการกินไปเลย 1 มื้อ หรือ เริ่มต้นทานมันแต่ผักเลย สิ่งใดที่ทำแล้วรู้สึกยากลำบาก เรามักไม่อยากทำหรอกครับ  4.ทำให้น่าพึงพอใจ จาก 3 ข้อแรกนั้นเป็นตัวกระตุ้นให้เรา”เริ่ม”ทำ แต่ข้อที่ 4 นี้คือหลักการเพื่อให้เรา”ยืนระยะ”ใ��การทำได้เรื่อยๆ จนมันกลายเป็นนิสัยใหม่ของเราเอง ซึ่งก็คือการให้รางวัลต่อการกระทำของเรา เมื่อได้ทำมันเสร็จแล้ว สมองของเราชอบครับเมื่อได้รับรางวัล และจะสั่งการให้ทำสิ่งนั้นๆ อยู่เรื่อยๆ ดังนั้น การยืนระยะ คือการทำให้สมองรับรู้ว่าทำสิ่งนี้แล้วจะได้รางวัลนะ มาทำกันเถอะ จริงๆแล้วในเล่มยังมีรายละเอียดอีกมากมายครับ ว่าอะไรคือเบื้องหลังของหลักการดังกล่าว ทุกข้อที่กล่าวไหนั้นมีงานจิจัยรองรับ ให้เหตุผลสนับสนุนอย่างดีเลย อ่านแล้วปรับใช้ได้ทันทีเลย ไม่ได้เป็นหลักการเลื่อนลอยจับต้องไม่ได้แต่ข้อเสียนั้น ซึ่งไม่รู้ว่าเป็นจากต้นฉบับจริงๆหรือการแปล คือ ผมว่ามันอ่านไม่ง่ายเท่าไหร่นะครับ เพราะเนื้อหามันดูค่อนข้างน้ำน้อยมาก เนื้อเน้นๆ แห้งๆ ทำให้อ่านไปบทสองบทต้องพักเพื่อย่อยข้อมูลหน่อย อ่านรวดเดียวนี่น่าจะเหนื่อยยากเกินไป และอีกประเด็นคือ คิดว่าการแปลยังไม่ลื่นเท่าไหร่ครับ บางอันเหมือนแปลอังกฤษและยังเป็นอังกฤษอยู่ ต้องมาเรียบเรียงเองใหม่ด้วย แต่ก็แค่บางจุดบางตอนนะครับ ไม่ใช่ทั้งเล่มในภาพรวม เลยเป็นหนังสือ How-to สาย Practical ที่ดีมากๆเล่มหนึ่ง ไม่แปลกใจว่าทำไมมันดังในต่างประเทศมาก่อนซักพักแล้ว ใครอยากปรับเปลี่ยนนิสัยของตนเอง ต้องอ่านเล่มนี้อย่างน้อยซักรอบหนึ่งนะครับ แล้วจะรู้ว่ามันทำได้ไม่ยากอย่างที่คิด ขอเพียงเริ่มให้ถูก วางแผนให้ดี ทุกคนๆสามารถเปลี่ยนแปลงตัวเองได้อย่างแน่นอนครับปล.มีคนถามผู้เขียนใน Goodread ว่าเล่มนี้กับเล่ม Power of Habit นั้นแตกต่างกันอย่างไร ผู้เขียนก็มาตอบไว้กว้างๆว่า เล่มของเขานั้นเน้นไปทางแนะนำแนวทางปฎิบัติมากกว่า ส่วนเล่ม Power นั้น เน้นไปทางทฤษฎีและการวิจัย ถึงผลกระทบของนิสัยและการปรับเปลี่ยนนิสัย ดังนั้น ถ้าให้ครบเซทก็ควรอ่านมันทั้งสองเล่มเลยนะครับ แต่จะอ่านอะไรก่อนหลังตามสะดวกเลย
185,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2101501-temi-panayotova-kendeva,Rating 3 out of 5,"„Атомни навици“ на Джеймс Клиър TEMIPANAYOTOVA НОЕМВРИ 8, 2019NO COMMENTЗдравейте, книголюбители!Вчера най-после приключих „Атомни навици“ и ми се искаше веднага да ви кажа няколко неща за книгата. И все пак това, че пиша веднага за нея, не е прецедент, че ми е харесала напълно.„Атомни навици“ е от порядъка на повечето книги за самопомощ, но също така доста залага и на реални истории, на човешкото мислене и психика.Вмомента, в който знаех, че книгата ще бъде издадена – нямах търпение да се докопам до нея. В последната година, открих, че имам неописуема страст към книги за себеопознаването, мотивацията, увеличаването на продуктивността и т.н. – т.е. нямаше как да пропусна и тази. Безкрайно ми беше интересно, какво ще ми предложи Клиър за зараждането на нови добри навици и ликвидирането на лоши.Книгата е доста обемна и лично на мен ми се искаше да не е. Можеше да бъде съкратена на половина, имаше прекалено много излишни неща.Разбирам, че писателят залага на опит, изгледвания и примери, за да обесни методите, които да бъдат следвани – но мен лично ме умориха в един момент. Определено ми дойде в повече да чета различни примери за културисти и спортисти – като цяло може би това е последствие, че книгата е писана от мъж и защото Клиър е бил бивш бейзболист. Как знам – защото го споменава n-на брой пъти в книгата. От лична гледна точка, може би малко повече щеше да ми хареса, ако беше написана от жена. Но това, както казах – си е моето мнение по въпроса.Няма да ви обеснявам, какво пише в смата книга – препоръчвам да я изпробвате сами. Но ще ви кажа, как книгата помогна на мен.От започването до приключването на книгата – аз се сдобих с няколко хубави и полезни навика, които ще продължа да прилагам и за в бъде��е. И запомнете, че за да стане едно действие навик – трябда да го повтаряте до тогава, докато то не се превърне в автоматично за вас. И да не е лесно понякога, но книгата определено дава насоки, как да се справите.Ето и моят опит:За да се освобождавам от стрес аз започнах да записвам дневни задачи в тефтер, да се занимавам със скрапбукинг или просто да пиша в дневник. Открих, че даже нещо просто – като рязане на картинки от списания може да бъде толкова терапевтично, след дълъг изморителен ден – повече отколкото да се свиеш на топка нещастен и да гледаш клипчета или сериали. Е, не съм се освободила от стреса напълно, но зная определено как се боря с него.*Доста бях нещастна от това, че всеки ден от мен се иска да правя избори и под това имам предвид един конкретен – да избирам какво да облека всяка сутрин. Това беше нещо, което ме правеше нещастна всяка вечер, когато си лягах. Беше като последната капка върху събрания стрес от деня. Мога да кажа, че ефективно се справих с този проблем – от както всяка вечер предварително подбирам и си оставям дрехи на тоалетката – вече не трябва да мисля за това всяка сутрин и имам достатъчно време да се приготвя и да тръгна навреме за работа. Това е нещо, с което още свиквам, но правя всяка вечер и съм определено по-щастлива.*Имам и още няколко по-малки примера – като това да си приготвям обяд за работа от предишната вечер вкъщи; или миенето на четките ми за грим поне по един път в седмицата; опитвам се да пия повече вода; мия чиниите след или малко по-късно след ядене.Е, остава ми тепърва да работя и върху, навици от които искам да се оттърва – като да си гриза ноктите или да си пипам косата – което правя винаги, когато почувствам даже малко стрес. Но премахването също отнема време и работа. Важното е да не се отказваш и да имаш последователност.Като се замисля, след всичко по-горе написано – определено съм взела доста от книгата на Клиър. Не казвам, че работи или е за всеки – но никога не боли да опиташ. Все пак човек се учи докато жив.Оценявам читателското си преживяване като 3/5 звезди.Благодаря на издателството за копието за прочит, което ми предоставиха!"

187,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28266234-7jane,Rating 4 out of 5,"(It's probably useful to read Duhigg's ”The Power Of Habit” before reading this book, since this book expands on it. You might also benefit, in small-step habit building-wise, in reading Maurer's ”One Small Step Can Change Your Life: The Kaizen Way”. I feel Clear's book doesn't talk about the small-step idea quite as much as I would've wanted.)This book tackles two kinds of habits: it shows you ways to start and keep good habits, and at the same time also what to do to end bad habits. And doing this through changes, through small, easy decisions that are the ‘atomic’ habits. First there's talk of the fundamentals of this approach, before we go through the four steps of change, with smaller ideas within each step, for both starting the good and ending the bad. At the end of the book are some smaller further lessons for these steps, and online addresses for further reading stuff from this book's author.The four steps are cue, craving, response, and reward. At the end of each of those four steps above there's a list of what smaller steps are within each (and those smaller step-chapter all end in what you've learned in each chapter).What I've learned (among many things):It's good to weigh on your already-present habits, to see which should stay and which to eliminate.That small habits can have huge impact on your life, but the impact is in the future, well beyond the 'excitement of the new' phase of the habit – it's important to be able to keep going until getting there.That sometimes you have to have something that will keep you doing the habit beyond the goal you've determined (fe. to keep running beyond the goal of completing a marathon).That one should weigh on what your identity, your temperament, your beliefs are – and, of course, to know what should one keep, and what should change.= decide what you want to be + build it with your habits and actions; what would ___ person do (fe. Non-smoking, healthy-eating, reading, exercising, meditating, journaling)And so on…Apart from the one frustration I mentioned at the start of the review, this book delivers nicely. I made plenty of notes of what I learned, and things were laid out clearly. I found the book quite inspiring, and the information is something I can see myself using when I start on my way of changing and adding some habits. A very useful read."
188,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11116469-sebastian-gebski,Rating 5 out of 5,"I tended to under-valuate books about habits. For me they felled all into a category of ""peptalkish"" self-help for bored housewives. I've changed my mind after reading Heath+Heath ""Switch"" - I've found it very good & in fact ... helpful. Not only in context of myself, but also others.I've read this one (AH) as some sort of experiment - some recommended it to me & I wanted to confirm whether there's anything else to add to the subject. The other reason was that I wanted to test Scribd streaming & this book was available ;)Anyway, honestly - this is a GOOD book. Maybe even more useful & easier to ""turn into action"" than beforespoken ""Switch"". My initial feeling was that JC (author) wants to ""sell"" me some ""framework"" he has pulled out of his ass (pardon the words), but it's not some artificial ritual but very reasonable & convincing break-down on how to introduce/break habits w/o relying on sheer motivation (which is proven not to work as well as we've always thought): cues, cravings, responses, rewards.His method really resonates with my own observations & what has worked & what didn't (in my past). It doesn't feel ""artificial"" or unnatural - IMHO thinking about builing/breaking habits in this way has a huge potential to really help you. The book itself ain't long or ""over-talked"": clear, well-structured, to the point, no cheap brain-wash.Truly recommended."

198,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26030644-matt-hutson,Rating 5 out of 5,"If you only read one book in your life Atomic Habits by James Clear is the one you should read.Have you read The Power of Habit by Charles Duhugg? It’s a great book, isn’t it? Well, Atomic Habits takes what you learn in The Power of Habit and builds upon it in an astronomical way. The best part is its practicality. There are many pieces of advice you can apply in your life.Honestly, when I first started reading Atomic Habits for a book club called Book Brewers in Surabaya, Indonesia that I helped co-found I wasn’t expecting anything different from any other self-development book. But then I realized after reading and discussing it at Book Brewers’ second meeting that this is not just ‘some’ ordinary book. James Clear has done a superb job of mixing learning about habits and embodying lifelong learning. He’s a pretty sneaky guy because most people don’t want to read about lifelong learning unless they’re interested in lifelong learning specifically. But a lot of people are interested in building better habits and stopping bad ones. It’s in actuality a book about lifelong learning disguised as a book about habits. Well, good for James Clear. It’s about time someone stepped up to the plate and delivered an actionable product. That’s what Atomic Habits is. An actionable product. YouTube: https://youtu.be/SA0uDtQ5siQBook Blog: http://bookmattic.com/reviews/atomic-...How to Approach Atomic HabitsThe best approach you can take while reading this book is to try different strategies to find out which one works best for you. Don’t try them all out at once. As Mr. Clear put it, these are the strategies he’s tried applying in his life but may not work for every person. You’ll have to do some experimentation and find out what works best for you. The most important takeaway you can get from Atomic Habits is that small changes seem unimportant at first, but then start compounding over time. Any good habit that is continuously repeated over time, no matter how small, will have a positive impact on your life in the long-run. The most important thing you can do is to show up. In order to make a habit stick, you must make it obvious, make it attractive, make it easy, and make it satisfying. These are the four laws of building a habit.25 Discussion Questions, Quotes, Strategies and Book Recommendations From Atomic HabitsThesis: Changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them. Key Features:Cue     Craving     Response     RewardOne: Make It ObviousTwo: Make It AttractiveThree: Make It EasyFour: Make It Satisfying Best Quote for this club: BOOK BREWERSOne of the best ways to become better is to join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior.

The thing that makes the difference is how they approach their practice or systems.We must stay in a cycle of endless refinement and improvement. (lifelong learning)Behind every action is a belief.By making a habit automatic it frees you up to focus on continuous improvement.If your habits remain mindless you can’t expect to change them. (awareness)Your habits change depending on the room you’re in and the cues in front of you.‘The lone wolf dies, but the pack survives.’ Game of Thrones, Ned Stark says to Arya in the first season.We don’t choose our earliest habits, we imitate them.It’s easy to get bogged down trying to find the best plan. Sometimes we get so focused on figuring out the best approach that we never get around to taking action. (This is why most people don’t succeed at what they want to do because they never get started.)It’s better to do less than you hoped than to do nothing at all.Positive emotions cultivate habits. Negative emotions destroy them.Most people will spend all day chasing quick hits of satisfaction. The Road Less Traveled is the road of delayed gratification. If you’re willing to wait for the rewards, you’ll face less competition and get a better pay off.The first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It’s the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows.Genes don’t determine your destiny. They determine your areas of opportunity.Mastery is the process of narrowing your focus to a tiny element of success, repeating it until you have internalized the skill, then using this new habit as the foundation to advance. Book Recommendations Similar to Atomic Habits–Cadence by Pete Williams (1% improvements)–The Creative Curve by Allen Gannett (Lifelong learning, The science behind creativity, purposeful practice)–The Four Agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz (Making agreements with yourself (your behavior))–Influence by Robert Cialdini (Influencing people’s choices)–Ego is the Enemy by Ryan Holiday (pursue power, prestige, and status)–The Laws of Human Nature by Robert Greene (pursue power, prestige, and status)–The 80/20 Principle by Richard Koch–Principles by Ray Dalio"

I am in the habit of automatically ignoring good advice from someone who believes they have found the only effective recipe for success and that anyone can do so by following their advice. And so I ignored it in this case.I wish this book was more research based. I found these fragments the most interesting. The results of some of the studies and experiments were really fascinating and I would love to read more about them. Of course, the author has included an extensive bibliography, so I can do that. But I would like to find more information in this book about the scientific research that supports the author's various theories.I am also not entirely sure if this author's writing style suits me. Even though this book seems very structured, to me it does feel chaotic at times. I was not quite able to separate one concept presented by the author from another. But that might just be my problem.Overall it was a nice book, but rather for people who are already interested in this topic and those who like this type of books. To the rest, I recommend When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing."

203,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28266634-liza-fireman,Rating 4 out of 5,"I really liked this book. It is very practical and interesting. It did remind me a little bit of The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business by Charles Duhigg. It included a lot less of the story telling, but included much of the advice of changing habits. It also reminded me of The Happiness Advantage: The Seven Principles of Positive Psychology That Fuel Success and Performance at Work by Shawn Achor. A really great book, that mentions adding friction to make it harder to go with bad habits (remove the remote control batteries, and it will probably make you think more about turning on the tv).  The author suggests that you should decide who is the person you want to be, and that habits make you who you are. Your habits shape your identity, and you can change your habits and identity (not sure that I am super happy with that phrasing, but there was much in the book that was really good, so I'll be willing to look away on this phrasing :)). I really loved his system: How to Create a Good HabitThe 1st law (Cue): Make it obvious.The 2nd law (Craving): Make it attractive.The 3rd law (Response): Make it easy.The 4th law (Reward): Make it satisfying.And:How to Break a Bad HabitInversion of the 1st law (Cue): Make it invisible.Inversion of the 2nd law (Craving): Make it unattractive.Inversion of the 3rd law (Response): Make it difficult.Inversion of the 4th law (Reward): Make it unsatisfying.It is worth mentioning that James Clear had a really terrible accident in baseball, and a serious head injury. He had been hit in the face with a baseball bat, and got into a comma. But this injury probably had a part of who he is today. This injury was one of mine, and the experience taught me a critical lesson: changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years. We all deal with setbacks but in the long run, the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits. With the same habits, you’ll end up with the same results. But with better habits, anything is possible. His parents were no strangers to the hospital, since his sister had cancer a decade earlier. Oh my, poor parents.Clear puts an emphasis on starting, even with a little tiny easy thing. Habits for the most part is doing something that you started, whether it is sitting on the sofa, or going to the gym. Habits are like the entrance ramp to a highway. They lead you down a path and, before you know it, you’re speeding toward the next behavior. It seems to be easier to continue what you are already doing than to start doing something different. He gives the example of running starting with tying your running shoes.I really liked this book. Practical and nicely written, with some great advice. 4 stars. "
204,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11317222-zara,Rating 3 out of 5,"I picked up this book because I am so deeply interested in the process of behavior change. There were some interesting insights that I’m finding helpful and immediately implementing, like “habit bundling” and optimizing my environment for the habits I want to promote, and the book covered a lot of strategies that I’ve already incorporated into my life, like habit tracking and maintaining a system for picking up or dropping habits (intention setting, manifesting and releasing with the full and new moon helps me). What’s standing out to me a lot is a lesson I’d already learned long before reading this book: “What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided.” Although this wasn’t the point of the book — which, like most self help books, lacked any analysis of how systems of oppression shape our conditions — this line made me reflect on how difficult it is for people to commit to ethical behaviors in a world that rewards oppressive behaviors. Clear writes too, though, about another lesson I’d already learned: “As soon as actions incur an immediate consequence, behavior begins to change… Behavior only shifts if the punishment is painful enough and reliably enforced. In general, the more local, tangible, concrete, and immediate the consequences, the more likely it is to influence individual behavior.” While I find it unfortunate that the author conflates punishments with consequences, I did find this insight valuable, and sort of affirming to read and reflect on.At the beginning of Chapter 15, I foolishly believed we were about to get a systemic analysis. Clear starts to write about Karachi, Pakistan in the 1990s where there was “no waste removal system, no electricity grid, and no clean water supply.” He writes, “The unsanitary conditions lead to widespread illness and disease. Contaminated water sources caused epidemics of diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Nearly one third of the children there were malnourished. With so many people crammed into such a small space, viruses and bacterial infections spread rapidly.” Reading all of this, there was no way NO WAY the author could be leading us into talking about anything but systemic solutions to systemic problems, right?? RIGHT?? Nope, the solution was….hand washing. Not just hand washing but hand washing the right way. I’m not trying to be dismissive here; he does say that there was a significant shift in the health of children in the neighborhood. And yet, I really thought he was so close to recognizing the limitations of hyper individualized solutions. That’s on me tho 😅"

This is the perfect example of why- don't take a 2 star to mean awful! Here is why ⬇️:The main ideas and principles of this book are incredibly important and I imagine helpful to many people. He does a great job of highlighting the importance of seeing the beauty and impact of focusing on small improvements that compound over time. I can absolutely see why this is such a leading book in the self help world.Also, I always love reading about fascinating studies in psychology or social experiments- who doesn't? My youtube history attests to how much I enjoy watching experiments on human behavior lol. If you enjoy stories and case studies that you would hear in the likes of a psychology class, you may especially like how he writes this book. Almost every chapter starts with one. If you don't like that? You will grow tired of those very quick.One thing that remains on my mind after finishing this is that he starts the book with personal background about an awful injury he suffered, and also how he ended up excelling in college by utilizing good habits. So I don't think it's wrong to assume the rest of the book would give details about the exact habits he used? Because... he doesn't. He gives several good strategies, yes, but I kept thinking, ""cool, but what habits did YOU use that you said made you so successful in college?"" Rather than relying on general scenarios of others using some of these habits, that would have added to this book a great deal since that is how he chose to kick off the book. It makes me question if his college success was purely from good habits as he says.I think the weak point of this book was in the execution. I think this book could have been much shorter, particularly due to its repetitive nature. That may just be a personal pet peeve though because perhaps my number one criticism about self help books I've read, is they could have been shorter. This also feels like a summary of other people's works and framed as his own ideas (like, literally renaming concepts that are already established.....kinda weird), rather than a new fresh take. And certain stories seemed to be really simplified to serve a particular idea, or I would wonder if it was even a good example to use for his point. Again, I may be overanalyzing here.In the end, I think this is an informative book about habits and the cognitive side behind them, and lays out useful strategies! However, the repetitiveness bogged down my enjoyment of this. "

Эта работа основана на большом опыте Джеймса Клира по внедрению привычек в свою жизнь, а также постоянного изучения этой темы и практики внедрения у своих клиентов. В принципе, теперь после этой книги, про привычки можно больше ничего не читать.ГЛАВНАЯ МЫСЛЬ КНИГИ:Атомная привычка - это маленькая привычка, которая является частью большой системы. Для внедрения хороших привычек вам нужна система и правильное окружение.ЗАЧЕМ ЧИТАТЬ ЭТУ КНИГУ:- Чтобы получить эффективные и проверенные подходы для внедрения новых привычек в свою жизнь.МЫСЛИ И ВЫВОДЫ ИЗ КНИГИ:- Выстроить систему важнее, чем поставить цели. - Цель задает направление, а система - это способ с помощью которого я достигаю целей.- Постановка целей ориентирована на победу в игре. Построение системы ориентировано на то, чтобы продолжать играть и после победы.- За каждым изменением в привычках должно стоять убеждение в том, какой личностью я должен стать. Иначе это будет одноразовая попытка. Изменения должны проходить на уровне убеждений и моих представлений о самом себе.- Причиной сохранения привычки может быть только то, что привычка стала частью моей личности.- Надо разделить пространство квартиры четко по типам деятельности, которыми я там занимаюсь. Тоже самое надо сделать и с гаджетами. Каждое устройство только для определенного типа работы.- Люди, которые обладают, как нам кажется, выдающимся самоконтролем ничем не отличаются от обычных людей. За счет внедрения правильных привычек, они просто сделали так, что его практически не нужно применять.- Надо создать окружающую среду, где выработать и сохранить хорошие привычки было бы максимально просто. В долгосрочной перспективе, мы становимся продуктом среды, в которой живем.- Хороший игрок хочет победить в игре, в которую играют все остальные. Великий игрок сам создаёт игру, в которой у него максимальные шансы обыграть других.

207,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22306206-neil-r-coulter,Rating 5 out of 5,"I’m not a huge fan of the self-help genre, because so often the books sound the same or are new lists of “5 Things to Do Today that Will Change Your Life Forever,” and so forth. The writing tends to be serviceable at best and is centered on sports metaphors. Every now and then, however, a book in this category rises above the rest and really connects with me in just the right way. Atomic Habits, by James Clear, is one of those great ones.Essentially, Atomic Habits is an update of Charles Duhigg’s The Power of Habit and its idea of the “habit loop.” Clear argues that what’s most important in bringing about personal change is not our goals, but rather, the systems we put in place in order to achieve a goal. Goals come and go, but the systems we build along the way are the real key. Duhigg’s habit loop is four parts: cue, craving, response, reward. The key to forming better habits is to understand how these phases work. Clear breaks it into four “laws”: make it obvious; make it attractive; make it easy; make it satisfying. By understanding the habit loop and then building everyday systems that benefit from these four laws, change is much more likely. The changes are “atomic” because they are both very small and potentially very powerful.Clear is a good writer, having honed his craft for some years as a disciplined blogger on this topic. He does use occasional sports imagery (professional baseball is in his family background and his own life), but he also gives space to other sorts of metaphors and ways of life. The guidance he gives on change and habit-formation is completely sound and very encouraging. I recommend it to anyone, in any stage of life."

209,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6428619-deepika-sekar,Rating 4 out of 5,"A quick, easy read that discusses plenty of ideas around habit formation and how to stick with them. I’ve personally found a couple of them really helpful – one being that one of the best ways to getting started on a new habit is to ritualize the first two minutes of it. The idea being our resistance is mostly to getting started and once that’s passed it usually gets easier. This has been especially useful with my running – my plan was just to put on my running shoes without thinking too much. Of course, I don’t do that as often as I want, but it really is easier once you get started and that can be as simple as putting on your shoes. Another thing that I have trouble implementing but seems like a great idea - is to designate spaces for certain things. The example cited is of people who had trouble sleeping and how when they stopped using their phones in the bedroom, they found it easier to fall asleep. I’ve been trying to do that – a couple of days I left the phone in the living room and swore that I’ll never again bring it to my bedroom – but oh it’s so hard. There were a number of other things that I’d known about earlier, but reading them again in this book – which is so well organized – was still worth the while."

You just have to make the next action you take, be one that is an action you want your ideal person to take3) A 1% improvement a day, can lead to a 37x improvement at the end of the year!

The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don’t want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change.You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.Focusing on the overall system, rather than a single goal, is one of the core themes of this book. It is also one of the deeper meanings behind the word atomic. By now, you’ve probably realized than an atomic habit refers to a tiny change, a marginal gain, a 1 percent improvement. But atomic habits are not just any old habits, however small. They are little habits that are part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results.Habits are like the atoms of our lives. Each one is a fundamental unit that contributes to your overall improvement. At first, these tiny routines seem insignificant, but soon they build on each other and fuel bigger wins that multiply to a degree that far outweighs the cost of their initial investment. They are both small and mighty. This is the meaning of the phrase atomic habits—a regular practice or routine that is not only small and easy to do, but also the source of incredible power; a component of the system of compound growth.”~James Clear from Atomic HabitsJames Clear has a super popular website (jamesclear.com). Millions of people visit it every month and over two million subscribe to his email newsletter.After reading this book, I can see why.He’s a great writer and distills the essence of habit formation into, well, its fundamental components—the “atomic” structure if you will—while showing us how those TINY little incremental improvements add up to MIGHTY results. (We’ll talk about the math behind +1% daily gains in our first Big Idea.)Now, I rarely say a book is a must-read but this one’s as close as it gets.I’ve read, and featured via Philosopher’s notes, a lot of books on habits—from 
The Power of Habit

I think you’ll love it. Get a copy here.The book is PACKED (!!!) with Big Ideas. It’s one of those books that is SO GOOD it’s really hard to distill into a six-page Note. We’ll barely scratch the surface of all the goodness, but I’m excited to share some of my favorites so let’s jump straight in!Some of my favorite big ideas from this book include:1. Tiny Changes - Remarkable results.2. Latent Potential - And its plateau.3. Identity - Literally: “repeated beingness.”4. The 4 Laws - Make it: Obvious + Attractive + Easy + Satisfying.5. The Sorites Paradox -Which coin makes you wealthy?I’ve summarized those Big Ideas in a Philosopher’s Notes TV episode that you can watch here.

The point is, if you feel that you might need a bit more order and structure in your life, or if you're annoyed that you can't stick to healthy or productive habits, then this might actually help. For me, there were at least a few takeaways. One thing that I'm pondering is how to design my environment to help me stick with a habit. And it's as easy as placing a glass full of water on the nightstand before you go to bed if you want to drink water first thing in the morning. Another cool trick is using down-time to do small chores. Like cleaning the toilet while you wait for the water in the shower to get warmer. You're already there in the bathroom and doing nothing, might as well make the most of it.That said, there are also some weaker parts. He does have a few moments throughout the book where he feels the need to do some life coaching, which, in my opinion, he could have scrapped. I always feel that funny moments are more memorable than personal confessions (and the confessions here never stop), so I would have liked more jokes instead. But, then again, not everybody can make jokes work, so, I guess that, here too, he plays to his strengths. (or avoids his weaknesses)Good book, easy read and just about the right length. Now I’ve got to find a good place to put some weights so I can stumble over them in the morning. (#workoutgoals)"

Great book on how to create of break habits.I Atomic Habits useful as I did with the book Deep Work by Cal Newport in the sense that both are about improving productivity. Deep Work was more impactful to me though as some things in Atomic Habits were repeated from other books I've read like The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg. Power of Habit was more so the importance and impact habits have on you, as oppose to Atomic Habits which I found more practical in the sense that how you can make or break productive or unproductive habits. It also reminded me of the Compound Effect by Darren Hardy because of how he talks a lot about how little changes in your daily routine can make a big impact down the line, and about compound interest.Notes:- Change your identity change your habits - not I’ll try and run, instead say I am a runner and I’m going for a run. Look at what you want and ask yourself what type of person would I have to be to get to that and adopt traits and habits that go with that type of person- Every goal has systems in place. It’s the systems that you can always adapt and change. What, When and where?- Habits are automatic, you don’t even think about it.- Cue - Craving - Response - Reward- Cue is first indication to remind you, a trigger - noticing- Crave is desire and motivation of the reward. - wanting- Response is a thought or action which is the habit - obtaining- Reward is the end goal - Satisfy the craving.- Use 4 laws to create a good habit - cue make it obvious, craving - make it attractive, response - make it easy, reward - make it satisfying- Use 4 laws to break a bad habit - cue make it invisible, craving make it unattractive, response make it difficult, reward make it unsatisfying- Remove the cue to the craving, remove the craving- Environment is very important, your closest friends and family have great influence on your habits - because it's ""normal"""""

I think that the core ideas here, i.e. ways to maintain your habits, could indeed be useful to a lot of people including me. But beyond these ideas there's a lot of fluff:Countless ruminations on human nature which are just opinions masquerading as facts. ""Improving our odds of survival and reproduction are the deeper motives behind everything we do."", ""Until you work as hard as those you admire, don't explain away their success as luck."", and, referring to a Seneca quote in one of the worst takes I've ever read, ""Being poor is not having too little, it is wanting more.""Or the quotes attributed to the writer's own role-models of success: Warren Buffett, Scott Adams, and Naval Ravikant as always with his self-evident truisms like ""The trick to doing anything is first cultivating a desire for it."" or ""To write a great book, you must first become the book."" Of course I'm cherry-picking here: these are just the points in the book where I came close to giving up.What I guess I'm trying to say is that reading this book could be a pleasurable experience for those who align with these opinions and look up to these people, but I sympathize with others like me who sat through it constantly having to filter out all the superfluous garbage."

Hábitos atómicos no entrega secretos ni fórmulas mágicas, nada de lo que dice te va a hacer explotar el cerebro, pero creo que eso es lo interesante, que todo lo que dice hace sentido porque es sencillo y lógico.Algo curioso fue que mucho de lo que el libro decía yo ya lo aplicaba, como dije, todo era lógico y hacía sentido. Yo usaba su técnica para crear hábitos y rutinas sanas y la verdad es que soy buena manteniéndolas, este libro lo que hizo fue explicarme por qué algunos hábitos los mantuve mejor que otros.Creo que es útil y con buenos tips, no es uno de esos libros que pretende vender algo profundo, pero en realidad es solo humo y ninguna forma de aplicarlo de forma realista. Tiene buenos tips, además de explicaciones detalladas de cómo aplicarlos e incluso tablas para descargar y rellenar.Otra cosa que me gustó, fue que explicó con ejemplos reales varias cosas. Algunos experimentos, ejemplos de equipos de algún deporte y otros grupos, por medio de estos ejemplos fue demostrando los puntos que presentó en su libro. Lo que ayudó a reforzar lo que decía y mostrar que ciertas cosas con cambios pequeños podían provocar grandes cambios.No tengo mucho más que decir de Hábitos atómicos, me pareció un buen libro, con consejos prácticos y realista, además de buenas explicaciones detrás de cada uno."

Everyone is aware of the long term impact of small healthy habits, but the real struggle is the continued application of the same. This book lists down really easy, but impactful steps one can take to ensure consistency. Be it getting fitter, honing your skills, have more impactful relationships, get rid of an addiction, gain mastery in a subject - James Clear provides a simple and facile framework at our disposal. I used to think that having a set routine will take out the excitement from life; but it doesn't need to work that way. One can be spontaneous and accustomed to a routine at the same time. The areas of applicability of the two are different; for example, routine in learning and exercising, spontaneous in art and travel. A person can be both structured and creative. I did not give a perfect 5 because these are ideas which weren't very new to me; but the book brings them all together and provides a foundational tool on how to apply the same to create a better life.I am looking forward to applying the valuable lessons learnt in daily life!"

And listen, I know it's me, not you, but they're really not helping. You have here the author talking how great his life is and obviously he's been through bad things but if you make tiny changes, your life will get so much better. And he has a point, obviously, but making this a 300 pages long book, so repetitive, so annoying, so boring...just no. I feel like this type of books are way too superficial, trying to make you see that the world is actually so beautiful and if you want to fly, you can achieve that.

In general one will learn a lot and will try to reflect. While reading I remembered something that I started to do for years. I put a reminder every Tuesday that I must write a blog post, and continued to do that (wrote the blog post every Tuesday) and then life happened, my responsibilities increased and so did my family and my time became shorter. Well that’s my excuse and after reading the book I realized that excuses are for losers. I should have built and stacked those atomic habits + made deliberate practice to arrive at mastery.

You may set some goals/objectives and get pumped and achieve them for some period but then you see yourself back to 'square one' - as probably we failed to work on the ecosystem or the infrastructure (which remained an obstacle rather than an enabler to the change). The ecosystem should be working in your favor (it shouldn't be that we need to exert so much of 'will-power' everytime we need to achieve something)."

I found the book to be very interesting, I never knew how we formed our habits. Knowledge is power, understanding how makes it easier to make changes. I loved that it wasn't a cold turkey deal. You take a look at you, what you are doing now daily and think about what you want to do. From there the author shows you how to add small details to your day to develop this new habit. I would recommend this anyone who wants to add or leave habits behind. It's a fast read gets to the point quickly."

James Clear's Atomic Habits is a testament to the power of tiny, incremental changes, or as he calls them, ""atomic habits"".The Power of Tiny ChangesAtomic Habits is a practical guide that teaches readers how to form good habits and break bad ones. Clear's approach is rooted in the idea that small habits make a big difference. He emphasizes the significance of small, manageable adjustments in daily routines, which compound over time to create significant and lasting results.The book presents a system for habit formation, focusing on four key strategies: making the habit obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying. Clear argues that people are driven by unconscious habits and thoughts, and positive change cannot take place until we identify our operating beliefs and thought processes.A Practical GuideAtomic Habits is not just a theoretical exploration of habit formation. It's a practical guide filled with actionable advice. Clear provides readers with a set of simple rules for creating good habits and breaking bad ones, making the book an invaluable resource for anyone seeking to understand the mechanics of habit formation and change.Final ThoughtsAtomic Habits is useful for those looking to build a solid foundation for lasting change. It's an insightful book that provides practical strategies for creating positive habits and breaking destructive ones. Clear's engaging writing style demystifies the process of habit formation and guides readers on a transformative journey.In conclusion, Atomic Habits is a book that will reshape the way you think about progress and success, and give you the tools and strategies you need to transform your habits, and ultimately, your life."
280,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31914940-dhwani,Rating 3 out of 5,"These are the things I learnt (some in my words, some in the words of the author) from the book Atomic Habits by James Clear. Read this 300 page book only if you are willing to make changes to your life. As often it happens with non fiction books, specifically self help, they are just read and not followed. Then the genre of self help as a whole is cursed for not being good enough. My review of this book would be a mixed one. It’s very informative sure but subconsciously, we already know these things. At least, I found myself knowing a lot of it. It’s just the application part wherein we lack. Some concepts are really interesting. I do have a controversial comment to add though, if someone would've been able to make changes to their life as ask to, why would one be needing or reading this book? Sure, it would serve to be a good guide but this isn't something one can do in a day or week. It requires consistency, sheer consistency and awareness. For those who want to understand the habits and it’s science, I’ll recommend this else, I’ll just say, • Sit down • Observe and try to understand why you do what you do • Have a clear goal• Work on that goal by changing your behaviour and habits. We already know a lot about ourselves. For beginners, it's a book quite interesting. Do read!"
281,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/84093356-ananya-thakur,Rating 5 out of 5,"We often heard people discussing about how hard work is primarily important for attaining success in life. But never do they tell exactly how the first step should be taken. How should one deal with one's fears and insecurities. And what about the fluctuating motivation one used to experience repeatedly. Applauding a person when he or she has reached the peak of mountain is good. However, willing to scrutinize their trekking strategy and learning from their determination of continuing the arduous journey is something that should be taken more seriously. I first came to know about the competency of developing a good habit after reading the widely acclaimed book by Charles Duhigg. That book really blowed my mind. And now after three months of having gone through that book, i came across another powerful book on habits. As i have already gone through the wonderful ratings and reviews of my fellow friends, i was quite sure about the gratification which i would have received on picking this one. And now after spending more than a week on this book, i can delightfully vouch for its worthiness.At the mere age of twenty-one, James Clear had got into an accident, where he got smacked on his face by a baseball bat, which in turn put a question mark on his baseball career, something he has always aspire for. After going through the consequential series of disappointment and frustration, he, one day, decided to come out of the sorrowful phase his life was gradually into. In the first year of his college, he started reflecting on the small and negligible behavior that encompasses the major hours of his every day. He made little changes and inculcate some easy and significant habits in his daily routine. Overtime he experienced a discernible change in his productivity and efficiency. Not only did he participated in the game, but also won the first prize of the college tournament. With an intention of sharing his life experience with all, he began writing blogs and later published this book.This book deals with all the questions that bugs our mind whenever we decide to adopt a new habit. The author has addressed all the issues relating to lack of motivation, boredom, self control, staying committed to one goal, missing on some days and finding joy in continuing. He has also shared techniques and methods like Habit stacking, environment design, habit scorecard and temptation building for dealing with the above mentioned issues. And not the forget the four laws of behavior change, which he delineated in great detail. I specially like the third aspect of behavior change, in which he stressed on making identity-based change rather than outcome based. This is an outstanding work which particularly focuses on the ways and methods of inculcating a good habit and breaking a bad one."
282,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7275200-audrey,Rating 4 out of 5,"I really enjoyed this book. I wound up listening the audiobook and following along with the hard copy. I found it very helpful to *hear* the book and this was a great preview of sorts because even though I marked up my physical copy now I plan to do back to dial into the sections that I want to apply to my life and that I know will be impactful.I'm learning that with some self-help books I benefit by reading the whole book and then going back to put it into action vs. trying to take action steps as I go along. I have a much better perspective at the end of the book.James Clear narrates the audio and for the most part I found the content very accessible and universal. I'm less interested in the science behind why we can't sustain habits - just tell me what to do thank you very much. Haha!It felt good to hear that I have some good foundational habits in some areas and it was also a screaming reminder of how I let some of my good habits go (like my habit tracker) and I definitely learned some new tips and strategies.Overall I've found this to be one of the more universally helpful books in that it's general enough that anyone can apply it to their lives but it also has specific steps and metrics that you can implement. It's also not overwhelming - the core message of this book is to take small steps and make small, attainable shifts. Those efforts will compound and grow over time. The best example is when he talks about wanting to get in shape - your initial goal shouldn't be to work out 5 days a week for 1 hour at a time. The first step is just to put your sneakers on. Then it's 5 minutes. That's all. It's all about building a foundation and adding to it. I love this philosophy. I like the structure of the book and love a chapter ending that summarizes the highlights so I know which chapters to dive back into. I've had this book on my shelf for nearly a year and am so glad I finally picked it up. Change. Starts. Here."

This book talks about the importance of atomic habits, how to build and sustain good ones and avoid bad ones. The basic idea is to - (1) Be aware of our current habits - we can do this by tracking/reviewing ourselves daily.(2) Identify the habits that are working for us and the ones that aren't.(3) The author describes the stages of habit forming as (a) Cue, (b) Craving (c) Response (d) Reward(4) The book contains several examples to make these 4 stages very clear to understand.(5) For any habit that we want to retain or create newly - we should try and be creative at all stages of habit forming. Which includes - Cue --> Make it Obvious Craving --> Make it attractiveResponse --> Make it easyReward --> Make it Satisfying(6) And for bad habits that we would like to get rid of, we should try and do the opposite - Cue --> Make it InvisibleCraving --> Make it UnattractiveResponse --> Make it difficultReward --> Make it UnsatisfyingI found the following poem in the book very inspiring:Men are born soft and supple;dead, they are stiff and hard.Plants are born tender and pliant;dead, they are brittle and dry.Thus whoever is still and inflexibleis a disciple of death.Whoever is soft and yielding is a disciple of life.The hard and stiff will be broken.The soft and supple will prevail.May we all find the strength to embrace change and stay soft and supple all our lives!

The ideas are simple and easy to follow, and he gives concrete examples and even templates for things like habit tracking and evaluating your habits. James Clear also explains the psychology behind his system, sprinkled with interesting, but not too many, real life examples. For example, we are wired for immediate satisfaction, but most good habits have delayed gratification - so he suggests finding an immediate reward. Some simple techniques are habit stacking - i.e. connecting a new habit to an existing one, or the 2 minute rule - that a new habit should not take longer than two minutes. First, establish the habit, later refine or add to it. Very useful. I have listened to it, but ordered a copy and will review it in print, so I can make notes. Highly recommend to every procrastinator out there - of whom I am a major example."

I am just amazed at what I learned -- the whole book is now underlined and highlighted with plenty of things I want to refer back to. But best of all, I've already put plenty of the suggestions into place, which includes changing my home office around -- something that I'm happy to say, really works. I especially liked the section that talked about ""motion"" versus ""action.""

James Clear encuentra el equilibrio perfecto en Hábitos Atómicos: ciencia amena, aprendizaje y deleite. El título sirve de introducción, desde él imaginamos de qué va. Empezamos conociendo la mecánica de los hábitos y su importancia en el comportamiento humano.

I did t feel that any of the information was new or profound to me, but I enjoyed the way the author pulled it all together. I will need to reference certain tools & graphics when utilizing some of the techniques because those seem really helpful. All in all— a great book and easy to digest. "

Habit stacking and reducing the friction are two of my favorite tips. The audio is well-read and the book isn’t too long. This book will help you start new habits and quit bad ones. I especially love the way the chapters are laid out in such a useful manner. At the end of each chapter he does a summary and directs you to a webpage where you can get a cheat sheet.

And in all honesty I didn’t think I could possibly love it any more than the first time around. But I was sorely mistaken. The first go-around I listened to the audio book, which, while fantastic, doesn’t have the same effect as reading the physical copy with the diagrams. 11/10 would recommend. "

309,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24619582-achilles,Rating 5 out of 5,"5 Star Knowing that one should look upon one’s habit is one thing, but to get the answer like “What”, “When”, “Where” and “How”- is what the book “Atomic Habit” does. The book has a plethora of real-life events that portray “Habits are like compound interest”. James started with his own-not-so-happy-incident from his life and how subsequently he went on to the quest of creating the Atomic Habits empire.The essence of the whole book is put into a nutshell of four life-defining rule:•	Make it Obvious (Cue)•	Make it Attractive (Craving)•	Make it Easy (Response)•	Make it Satisfying (Reward)To achieve big in life it’s not necessary that we do only big things. A small percentage of improvement on a daily basis can also achieve the same thing. One has to overcome his/her “Plateau of Latent Potential”- as the author suggests. It’s good to have goals in life but do not focus on goals rather accrue your potential to create a “belief system” to achieve that goal. Winners and Losers have the same goals but what differentiates them is “System” they followed to get the goal.Every rule begins with a spellbound example from the annals of successful history. Be it entertainment, sports, medicine, scholar – every example is so inter-related with the habit that it feels unbelievable that a minute habit can have a remarkable impact. James also gave few strategies to practice this in our daily life like “Habit Score Card”, “Habit Stacking”, “Habit Contract” and many more. One of my fav. concepts from the book is “The Goldilocks Rule”: It says, “The human brain loves a challenge, but only if it is within an optimal zone of difficulty.”The amazing thing I liked in the book is how meticulously James observed the nuance in once behaviors. How one’s habit gets created and shaped in the society he/she lives, whom they talk, whom they listen, and what object they use. The book is not targeted only for a particular sect of society but it encapsulates the whole of mankind. I think this is the book one must have on their shelf."
310,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/162337394-mary-conrad,Rating 4 out of 5,"AHH! Im not one to pick up a self-help book and get through it, but thank u for inspiring me to finish this one @Claire. Couldn’t recommend a read more going into the new year. James Clear is completely candid about the realities of human nature and human behavior in a way that makes you trust what he has to say. He provides a swath of information from a wide range of fields including neuroscience, biology, psychology, etc. to explain how and why our brains work the way they do and how and why we can face anticipated challenges based on how we are wired to work. From here, Clear gives us solution-oriented, practical, and evidence-based solutions to begin rewiring our brains to build healthy habits and break unhealthy ones (he even links to tangible tools on his website to begin planning/ implementing your own path to GREATNESS if you want). Lastly, I loved how there were countless examples of professional sports teams, business executives, medical professionals, artists and celebrities, etc. embodying the techniques Clear references with much to show after the fact. I am an all or nothing person, but this book made me realize that it’s not how fast, large, or specific your goals are that make them great. It’s about how consistent you show up for yourself, how aligned with your identity and how obvious, attractive, easy, and rewarding your habits are that can make you successful. BOOM. "

312,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/65666930-atharva-amdekar,Rating 5 out of 5,"I generally tend to avoid reading self-help books because I believe its more natural to learn from your own past experiences rather than someone else's, which is why I always found it difficult to relate to, and apply the lessons written by self-help authors. However, reading this book was certainly a different experience. The author provides a cogent, and a scientific approach, unlike the philosophical approach of most self-help books. He breaks down the formation/destruction of good/bad habits into easy-to-understand and easy-to-apply systematic components. This book also taught me a lot on how the human psyche works in tandem with our environment. He talks about how our brain is wired to overvalue radical changes in our behaviour as against the undervaluation of small changes over a longer period of time, which was the most important lesson I picked up from this book. A must-read for anyone who wants to form/break good/bad habits. However, I'd suggest to read only a few pages everyday so that you are able to apply those learnings as you go along. Reading this book like a story book and aiming to apply everything after completing it in its entirety will probably do you no good."

325,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23294527-jas-reads,No Rating,"DNF at 15%I picked this up as my next audiobook for 2021 but I have no desire to continue listening to it for multiple reasons.First, the book starts with an incredibly gruesome and graphic account of that time the author got hit in the face by a baseball bat and almost died. As someone that's somewhat squeamish, listening to him tell me that his eye flew out of his socket when he sneezed put me off straight away from the start. That's a warning that I wish I got before actually starting this book.Even so, I decided to read a bit more and see what its like when he actually gets to the habits bit. Needless to say, disappointing. There's only so many times I can listen to ""Available at www.atomichabits.com"" before I start rolling my eyes. We get it, you have an incredibly successful productivity website. You don't need to mention it every other page. Repetitiveness of ideas also seems to be the basis of this book. I think he said the words ""goals"" and ""system"" around 50 times in 30 min, which really showed me that this book is way too long and that the point he is trying to get across could be made in a few bullet points instead. Reading some other reviews, its clear that I already got the main ideas of this book without even getting to 50%.Also, one of my biggest pet peeves is when people make metaphors that are meant to be deep but really they could describe a number of things. The first one that comes to mind is when he talks about the success ""threshold"" or ""plateau"". He compares it to a sculptor hitting a rock a 100 times and only splitting it on the 101st hit. This is just a personal preference but I just don't like it when people compare situations as if they're identical when trying to make a point. You can just say that getting in shape only happens once you've done it for a longer time. I'd rather you give me the scientific basis behind it (which would much more convince me of its credibility) rather than comparing it to a glass of water that only spills after 1000 drops. Eye roll. And yes, I know that he does mention some scientific backing of the formation of habits but all the comparisons still annoyed me, and made the book way longer than it should be.Finally, I just didn't like his narration. He didn't seem excited to read this book to us. It was all very robotic and monotonous. Didn't excite me to listen to it.I know this was a rant, but as someone who loves productivity and planning and forming good habits I was keen for this book. Maybe I didn't like it because he didn't tell me anything I didn't know from before or just because I wasn't a fan of the writing/narration. But anyway, first DNF of 2021, yay!"

Bạn mình vẫn bảo: ""Những người siêng thì siêng theo cùng một tạng. Còn những người lười thì lười vạn kiểu"", thế nên, nhòm ngó xíu xiu vào thế giới của tụi chăm chỉ chắc cũng ổn thôi.Tựa gốc của nó là ""Thói quen nguyên tử"" đại loại là, những thói quen nhỏ sẽ ảnh hưởng đời bạn ra sao, nhưng qua con mắt ""phải thật kêu để bán được sách"" thì nó thành ra dài dằng dặc như thế. James Clear, thực ra cũng chẳng có một phát kiến gì mới, ông chỉ viết trên nền tảng những cuốn khác, đúc kết lại dựa trên chính kinh nghiệm của mình, rồi tòi ra cuốn này mà thôi.Bỏ qua phần đầu khá lê thê và kinh dị, thì những phần sau đó được viết rất rõ ràng, rành mạch (y như tên tác giả - Clear :v), truyền đạt đủ ý đến người đọc. Mình đọc một mạch trong cả buổi chiều, có lược qua vài chỗ, nhưng vẫn thấy cực kỳ thú vị. Căn bản, một thói quen (dù tốt hay xấu) được hình thành dựa trên 4 yếu tố: tín hiệu, cơn thèm muốn, phản hồi, và phần thưởng. Chẳng hạn, với thói quen nghiện ngập cafe của mình:Tín hiệu: bạn thức dậyCơn thèm muốn: bạn muốn tỉnh táoPhản hồi: Bạn uống một tách cà phêPhần thưởng: Bạn thoả mãn mong muốn được tỉnh táo. Uống cà phê dần liên kết việc thức dậy(Ví dụ trên mình lấy của youtuber nọ, chứ mình lười lắm)Đoạn sau, tác giả đi sâu phân tích từng yếu tố rồi đưa từng mẹo nhỏ, dễ ghi nhớ, dễ thực hiện lồng vào. Chẳng hạn, hãy xen kẽ điều bạn ""cần"" làm trước khi làm điều mình ""muốn"" làm: Toai sẽ chấm bài rồi mới đi coi anime :sss Hay việc cần quên đi mục tiêu mà cần nhìn vào cả một hệ thống ẩn dưới những thói quen thường ngày. Ví dụ như, thay vì nghĩ ""Mình sẽ tăng cân"", hãy nghĩ rằng ""Người khoẻ mạnh sẽ ăn gì nhở?"".Mình nghĩ, điều quan trọng của cuốn sách này không nằm ở chỗ những mẹo vặt, tip hay, mà ở chỗ nó thay đổi tư duy của người đọc một cách dần dần, từ từ, như chính cách thói quen thay đổi cuộc sống của ta. Nó vén lên bức màn ""định kiến"" vẫn che phủ ta bấy lâu, để sẵn sàng dấn bước vào một cuộc hành trình dài. Bởi, vạn dặm bắt đầu từ một bước chân, nhỉ?"
327,no user info,Rating 1 out of 5,"Maybe I'm just a massive git who should not be allowed to read self-help books, but I can't figure out why people like this book so much. It was not good. I had to read over 10k student essays while I was a TA in grad school, and I gotta say...the content and writing read like a college paper (albeit a very good one) about this guy's research and personal opinions about habits. If I were to break out the content of this book, it would go something like this: 73% material that anybody with a dash of resolve already knows; 14% interesting anecdotes not always relating to habits ; 11% the author's self-promotion; and 2% useful (though not entirely new) information. Honestly, I think the more interesting under-lying message is ""How to obtain notoriety and make a ton of money off of concepts already commonly understood and researched by others.""I am no expert on habits and I am certainly not a writer, so criticism is not my goal. But people need to calm down about this guy. My personal opinion is that the book makes a few HUGE errors in its messaging: 1) the way to improve is to essentially trick yourself into doing good things, 2) the author regularly suggests that outward reinforcement is most effective (telling people that you are a runner will make you one), and 3) there is a complete and resounding absence of 'character' in his formula of good/bad habit creation/removal. If a person has character - an internal motivation to improve for the sake of improvement alone - then establishing good habits and removing bad ones is more than possible without having to shut off your brain. Again, I am not an expert by any means! His message simply did not match up with my perspective on human development and life in general. #peoplearedifferent."

I decided to get a copy of this as an e-book, although it sounds nicer to have a physical copy of the book, you can refer back to all that stuff later.It's true, everything being pointed out is the reason by all your habits. The environment, the association, keeping up a habit streak, less likely to repeat a habit if it's bad... wait. Am I just repeating the same thing over and over again?Yes... yes you are. I didn't come for the same old garbage I have been taught for years. Minus all the story times, examples, even more story times, this book would have been pocket sized. I do like me some small books, though.And the more I read the book, the more I got bored of it. Not just because of the repetitiveness but because the author keeps acting like he made an original point. Pleaseeeee man. You didn't get out of bed and say ""Hey, there is something missing in my life, I've been doing everything wrong! (and thus, habits were invented)"" and start writing stuff down.The book is just written by your everyday man, with a life, a job, and some extra hobbies. Some of this stuff you can easily Google and read about in a smaller article.long story short... any other self-help book but this one may really get you thinking. he's not entirely wrong, though."

Chances are if you have picked the book you already know this. The title is not misleading at all but be aware that this book would be most helpful if you have a commitment to building good (or aligned with your goals) lifelong habits. Its key idea is building identity based habits vs. outcome based habits. The author breaks down the process of habit building and for most of the book he takes you through each step or key element (4 that he identifies) each of which is a chapter. Although the book is peppered with several examples to reinforce ideas, not all of them seemed fitting to the point being made. It certainly has some helpful hacks (my favorite being habit stacking, two minute rule) , lines that I am sure would bode me well to remember, makes one aware of the subconscious cues one responds to and makes the point on the compounding effect of small habits effectively. The book is designed to be instructional with an added bonus of cheat sheet links, neat tables and bulleted summaries at the end of each chapter. Well, the book did prompt me to write my first review .. something I had been procrastinating for long , let’s see if I can keep up with the new identity ."
