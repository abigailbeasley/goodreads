0,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22889862-sanjida,Rating 3 out of 5,"The authors of this book want us to be aware of our positionality, so I'll tell you that I've been a scientist in the field of genetics for over 20 years, more recently as a curator and manager of delivering data to the public. I'm also a woman of color who thinks a lot about ethics and equity. Which is to say, I really try to think critically about data, scientific and otherwise. I take this book literally. I fully agree that we need to look at what biases lay behind the hypotheses and interpretations of studies. I think scientists need to be clear in what parameters and variables are actually being measured, and whether it's meaningful to use certain categories at all (for instance, in my field, US racial categories are not very meaningful, and their use often obscures conclusions from data). I think it's important to define your terms, be as precise as you can and aware of how shorthand labels may mislead. I think we should consider what blindspots we may have, especially when doing research that impacts people and societies. And that interactions on an equal standing with people with different perspectives (professional and personal backgrounds) can help point out these blindspots. I think we should interrogate why certain jobs in STEM projects (e.g. curator vs data scientist) have more or less prestige, and what that says about our society. Therefore, I largely agree with the recommendations, such as they are, of this book. But I can't take this book seriously, because it frames these concepts, which I consider simply good practice, as feminism (by feminism, they mean an intersection of a gender+racial+class justice lens). Maybe I'm too much of a consequentialist, but my kneejerk reaction to this book was to reject putting the fetishization of identity ahead of practice. I was also hoping for more insights that would help in my professional life. Disappointingly, rather than give precise scenarios of study and analysis design, the authors tend to rely on quotes from feminist scholars they think are cool, and then shout out examples of research they like (i.e. done by people who they approve of) versus stuff they don't like (done by people they don't like). I kept thinking of data scientists I work with, many of them older men who didn't grow up in the US, and how I would love to recommend a book like this to them, so that they would think deeper about responsible use of data. But this book doesn't provide an accessible entry into this subject. I know the authors workshopped this manuscript - I just wish that in addition to consulting gender and cultural scholars, they had also been more intentional about running this work past more normies, maybe some of the ones who they mention were initially hostile to their project. Critical comments from that perspective would likely have resulted in a stronger product."
1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8655925-harsh,Rating 5 out of 5,"Let me begin this review by paraphrasing something the authors express early on in the book: don’t let the title dissuade you; this is a book that everyone should pick up (and the authors facilitate this by making it freely available online). A true understanding of feminism and the values that define it has become distorted by contesting voices or is resisted by the uninitiated for various subjective reasons (often due to misunderstanding). With this in mind, this book proved to be a very helpful primer for key concepts within the discourse - intersectionality, privilege hazard, positionality and so on - and it also framed and explained scary sounding things like ‘the matrix of domination’. D’Ignazio and Klein demystify these and other ideas by providing their epistemic context and then grounding them using real world examples - and plenty of them. They discuss the seven principles of data feminism in great detail through the chapters. It is admirable how they lead by example: proceeding reflexively, applying each principle to themselves, and evaluating their positions in the social structure and relative to the subject matter. For them this text is only meant to serve as a starting point to further conversation and is not an end in itself. Turning to its relevance, this book deftly deals with what is perhaps the most powerful item in the modern civilisational toolkit: data. What is it? Who collects it? For what purpose? With what consequences? Each chapter uses a particular lens to focus and understand what lies behind the curtain and explores the myriad complications involved with collecting and using data unquestioningly. At the same time, the point regarding the risks of the assumed objectivity of data is powerfully driven home. The authors highlight actionable steps to counter these and other problems at each stage. Anyone working with data - whether its collection, design, ethics, visualisation or analysis - or with its potentially transformative application in the fields of public policy, development, activism, local community work etc, must consider this book an essential reading. Lastly, to even a layperson who simply wants to better understand the way data shapes our world, to reflect on their own position within it, and to those who want to make it a little better, I cannot recommend this book enough. To my friend who perhaps thought I fit one of these categories, I’m grateful for it. (I also had her review this review to ensure that I’ve been responsible and accurate in my entry.)"

In a flawless feminist liberal approach, structural oppression is characterized like a ""privilege hazard,"" ignoring a serious analysis of the economic framework where technology is situated today to fortress those oppressions."

4,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11217004-cl-udia,Rating 5 out of 5,"4.5* stars but rounding to 5 because this is an essential read nowadays.It was a pleasurable read. I learnt a lot along the way. And having synchronised the reading with the weekly video seminars with the authors made it a much pleasant experience than I had before with a more ""academic"" book. Having experienced data science from my studies and as a job, I could relate myself a lot in this book. I learnt what is really behind data cleaning, why more women are hired as a data analyst (like myself) instead of data scientist, and which views are usually prioritised in data collection and analysis. But now, thanks to including the Feminism perspective, I see it as a field with high hopes for the future. As with many other areas, data science can be used for capitalistic purposes, but it can also help to bring up voices which have been silent for too long, visualise some deep problems and this way reaching a vast audience. "
5,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38328212-rachel-nevada-wood,Rating 4 out of 5,"After being assigned bits and pieces of this text in class, I finally bit the bullet and read it start to finish (mainly via the Open Access version from MIT Press). I'll start by saying that a lot of critiques I'm seeing on Goodreads here are a bit unfounded. Many of them center around the idea that this book is wishy washy and lacks concrete steps or information that could be handed to data scientists. I think folks who are making this critique are unfamiliar with (or uninterested in) the ways in which feminism is highly dependent on context. That does not mean that this book lacks clear direct guidance. (I mean, each of the chapters is literally organized a principle for action, backed up by feminist theory with examples of that principle in data science projects?). It means that you're going to have to take a general principle, like challenge power, and apply it to your specific context. That's going to take work and research and energy. If you're expecting this book to give you easy steps that you can check off (and then treat yourself to an ally cookie), look elsewhere.I agree that perhaps  Data Feminism  could have dug a bit deeper into the ways that capitalism and data aggregation are intertwined. But to say that the book ignores these connections is also a bit far fetched, especially considering they have a whole chapter dedicated to the concept of invisible labor and how it connects to the data and tech industries. Folks who were craving more (and deeper connections) between data and capitalism ought to check out Platform Capitalism or any one of the many, many books mentioned throughout this book.I personally have found this book to be an excellent starting point for how to think about, share, and connect communities to data (especially when thinking about my role as a data intermediary). The examples are numerous, rich, and detailed (I just wish the open access version had hyperlinks embedded in images to link to those projects!)."
6,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6782726-nikki-sojkowski,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is a fantastic introductory text for several fields— most notably intersectional feminism, data ethics/justice, and visual cultures. D'Ignazio and Klein dive into the highly relevant dangers that unmonitored data can cause, and use concrete and timely examples to ground their theories in reality. Instead of pointing out a problem and despairing, they delineate actionable steps relevant to anyone using digital technologies, even for the average ""layperson"" who just use sites such as Facebook or Twitter. This is a crucial text to anyone interested in what goes into data creation, maintenance, and/or use. This is a crucial text for anyone curious about how data manipulation impacts your day to day life. This is a crucial text for anyone interested in data activism.D'Ignazio and Klein are in the privileged position to permit the free use of their book, and I recommend taking advantage of that! Their book is free to read online. I would especially recommend reading their Intro, Chapter 3, and Chapter 6 at the bare minimum."
7,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6638317-jill,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is a great read, overall -- thoughtful conceptual framework, well-used theory, a great message and a lively tone. I certainly found some beautiful lines/quotations and great new formulations for how to think & speak about these topics in my workplace -- My main question mark about it is that I'm not entirely sure who the audience is. If it's people with a background in feminist/intersectionality theory, it's fundamentally pretty basic info (although the examples used to illustrate them are certainly interesting, albeit a few have that undergrad ""I randomly picked something to use as an example in my paper and it's due tomorrow so we're just going with it ok"" vibe). If it's data scientists who don't care about intersectionality, my suspicion is that it won't convince them. But if you're somewhere in the middle, or on one side with an interest in the other, I'm sure you'll pick at least something useful up!"
8,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5899086-ed-summers,Rating 5 out of 5,"I used this book as a textbook in my undergraduate Introduction to Digital Curation class. Based on the discussion and written assignments I think the students found it engaging and informative. The format, illustrations and overall structure of the book make for a very compelling read. It also includes very generous citations to the research literature and relevant projects which serve as a gateway into a wider world of cirtical data studies. I think this means it would work well in a digital visualization or digital humanities class as well."

So glad that this book have introduced me to the 7 data feminism principles, as well as all the wonderful projects around the world, especially those community-driven projects! They gave me lots of ideas.And I love how the authors audit their citations, making their greatest efforts to remain reflexive."
10,no user info,Rating 1 out of 5,"A book called ""Data Feminism"" that suggests collecting data on sex can be and often is inappropriate...🥴. If you like to hem and haw and not land anywhere firm that might require you to say what you think this is absolutely the book for you."
11,no user info,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5 stars from me!Really interesting perspective relating to data visualisations, and how keeping things ""neutral"" sends a message itself. I loved all the content relating to how the whole data process shouldn't be limited to ""experts"" and that we should engage with the communities we are collecting data on and that they should be involved. Working in government we consistently collect data that underrepresents certain groups and I've always thought this has a lot do with our eurocentric approach to data collection.Didn't really enjoy the way it was written, but gave me a lot to think about in terms of the way I have been taught to analyse and decipher data."
12,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/95248055-leonardo-longo,Rating 5 out of 5,"Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein present an evolutionary point of view about data science and data ethics, informed by intersectional feminist thought.With a structured and full of examples approach, the book offers strategies for data scientists seeking to learn how feminism can help them work toward justice, and for feminists who want to focus their efforts on the growing field of data science. The ideas presented on this book can be vastly explored in many other challenges related to intersectional data ethics."
13,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9896409-matthew,Rating 1 out of 5,"Ironically, this book is potentially more harmful than something which is less correct in its diagnosis of the problems associated to data science and data collection writ large.This book repeatedly gets lots of things right, in terms of describing the problems that we see: the biases associated to data collection, the biases inherent in having machine learning systems developed by unrepresentative groups, the ways in which systems and data collection can reinforce existing (malicious) power structures, the racist / sexist epistemic assumptions baked into data collection / analysis, etc. It even goes so far as to make correct claims about the politics: the ineffective nature of white saviorism, education as not necessarily an emancipatory force, the existence of power dynamics that preclude political action, etc.Then what?! It ultimately leaves any of the broader structural analysis at the roadside (racial capitalism, the particular history and economics of the way that data science is used in our modern capitalist system, etc.), and gives a broad guide about how ""we"" ought to be teaching data science. It falls back to a depressingly-liberal theory of change after hitting the nail on the head about all sorts of stuff, even going so far as to quote people that _certainly_ (and correctly) had more radical prescriptions about what to do with all this.The word ""capitalism"" appears exactly 3 times in this entire 200 page text, and only in passing, which might just summarize the problem with the whole damned thing. If it were wrong, we could maybe dismiss it more easily, and therein lies the danger. "
14,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83963768-jamie-donovan,Rating 3 out of 5,"A book full of convincing and interesting data projects and examples of how the many elements of data can be manipulated to serve the users purpose. The authors take an intersectional feminist lens and applies it to the tech industry. Its arguments are solid, but I disagreed with many of their suggestions. So much of the academic literature has shown increasing diversity among teams doesn't increase performance and replacing the objectivity of science with subjective experience doesn't sit right with me."
15,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7118531-vlad,Rating 4 out of 5,"I gained an education on how data is used and abused in service of power, and how to think clearly enough about it to do things right and better. Really enjoyed this book and will use its lessons to design more ethical, inclusive, and just systems, products, processes, and companies. "
16,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48805142-aastha,Rating 5 out of 5," 5 stars  Phenomenal. Everyone should read this, irrespective of whether you work in data science. This is important, accessible, well and intentionally researched, and most importantly, extremely sensitively (but boldly) written. I loved it and I know for sure that it has changed the way I will approach and work with data from now on."
17,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16092014-paul,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is a thorough and insightful exploration of the ways big data can perpetuate or exacerbate power imbalances when the people collecting, analyzing and reporting the data fail to interrogate the processes behind their measurement. It's well worth a read for anyone who uses or plans to use data as a tool for examining social structures – i.e., anyone in the sciences, the humanities or journalism – or anyone who might be reading those kinds of analyses. Which I guess is most everyone."
18,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14147818-nada,Rating 5 out of 5,"have you ever thought whether your dataset is *really* objective? or whether it perpetuates (not so) subtle discrimination and preserves the unequal status quo in its use and how the data are being displayed or represented? are data racist?---those questions might sound, uhm, silly. but it’s actually not—and they’re legitimate concern. have you ever thought how is the process of data collection? is data really n dimensional—and it most definitely excludes societal and cultural context? what about the labor costs of cleaning them, and invisible hands which went uncredited?data feminism is actually pretty straightforward and literal. but how does it work? how is it possible to apply feminist principles when we’re working with data? D’Ignazio and Klein propose the seven core principles of data feminism: it begins with examining how power operates in the world today—who benefits from it, who are neglected and who are harmed? “for people in positions of power and privilege, issues of race and gender and class and ability—to name only a few— are OPP: other people’s problems. In other words, those who occupy positions of privilege in society are able to remain innocent of that privilege. race becomes something that only people of color have. gender becomes something that only women and non-binary people have. sexual orientation becomes something that all people except heterosexual people have. and so on.”by examining the power, we can quantify and visualize the structural oppression to challenge and change the existing power and status quo preserved in the world today. third, is to elevate emotion and embodiment—honoring context while not subordinating ethocs nor emotions while visualizing them. fourth, is to rethink binaries and hierarchies—reexamining and rethinking assumptions and beliefs behind the infrastructure classifications. are we doing more harm than good? “in a world in which quantification always leads to accurate representation, and accurate representation always leads to positive change, then always counting gender identities outside the binary makes perfect sense. But being represented also means being made visible, and being made visible to the matrix of domination—which police the gender binary—poses significant risks to the health and safety of minoritized groups.”fifth, is to embrace pluralism. data scientists are not heroes and the data are not *mere* data, they are lived experience, trying to be quantified and translated into reports—rather than regarding themselves as such, data for co liberation model is offered as a better replacement for data for good model. There is a transfer knowledge between the data/theory experts to communities, which cultivates solidarity between both parties.We also need to consider context of how the data is being represented, which includes social power analysis of the said data setting. Lastly, we need to make labor visible—honoring the invisible labor involved in every step of data science. Whose labor is counted, and whose is being screened out?Something that really sticks with me is this paragraph from the nth chapter:“Big Dick Data is a formal, academic term that we, the authors, have coined to denote big data projects that are characterized by masculinist, totalizing fantasies of world domination as enacted through data capture and analysis. Big Dick Data projects ignore context, fetishize size, and inflate their technical and scientific capabilities.”which reminds me of a famous indonesian politician, well-known for his political activism, but also for his bIg dAtA glorification 😛I really appreciate their acknowledgement of their positions and experiences—of being white womxn from the global north, exposed to the elitist production of knowledge. it feels like multiple disclaimers that *they* are in the position of privilege, but also not an excuse to oversee anything. as the book employs the term “intersectional feminism”, they try to not talk exclusively about womxn and gender like other libfem books, but they try to incorporate positionality in every aspect of data science. another thing that i find to be lovely is the accessibility. although sold exclusively as a hardback, you can also read the book online on their site, data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/. they also add a brief summary by the end of each chapter—which i find to be wonderful.a few considerations into reading this: i still can feel that trans folks here are somewhat still being excluded, although they are being included in the metrics. in this book it is often written as “women and nonbinary people”—is it because they are trying to avoid the usage of “trans womxn/men” as they can be regarded as exclusionary as well?two, is that the print format—which is only available in hardback—makes the book really uncomfortable to be read casually. i personally chose to lend the digital copy in my library, although i own a copy. with its square shape and fancy paper, this book is incredibly heavy for casual reading, the font is too small to be read casually before bed. if anyone wants to read this, i’d strongly suggest to grab the digital copy—be it the ebook or the online copy.also, upon finishing the book i stumbled upon elizabeth garbee’s review that she was confused for whom was this book written—which i can agree that this lies in a confusing intersection: too “simple” for academics, too heavy for casual bookstore stroller. but like i said above, it’s only introductory level. in the introduction is also written that this book is meant for feminists trying to expand their knowledge within context of tech and data scientists to learn how feminism can be applied into their field by providing cases in which it was used—which can be understood why this book doesn’t seem so thorough.since i want to avoid giving ratings—we all know that they’re subjective, but i want to give more context that **they’re good**—here’s my first attempt of rationalizing my judgement:rounding up from my observations, i’d still recommend people to read this, especially those who are not quite familiar in the industry, or those are in the industry but quite unfamiliar with feminism. i haven’t finished invisible women nor algorithms of oppression, but from what i’ve read, if you enjoy both books, most likely you’ll enjoy this as well. as for someone who only knows one or two things in data science, this book is definitely for me."
19,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6432592-jenny,Rating 3 out of 5,"Don't disagree with the anti- capitalist agenda of this set of essays...also sympathetic to the feminist ideology and connecting it to tech work. However, the essay collection as a whole feels one-dimensional and ""preaching to the choir""-esque. Standard rhetorical strategy gives at least some space and effort to elucidate the opposing side of these viewpoints and the writers take for granted that doing so would strengthen all the supposedly supportive data they infuse throughout the chapters. Maybe it's just the fact that these viewpoints have, over the past three years, become mainstream...? There's a so-what? quality to the overarching points that data requires context and workers of color are not getting their fair share (which is also kind of supporting capitalism...? Like, the only way to succeed is to give money to ppl, which is true, but then fails to move society beyond capitalism...tricky). Idk...I feel like I'm on board but anyone who doesn't already believe in these ideas already wouldn't be convinced, so it's a bit disappointing in that sense."
20,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31833834-alexander-smith,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book should be a required text for every data scientist and quantitative social scientist. While I think there are some things that could have been more theoretically well explained, in the context of what this book is attempting to do, it wasn't necessary to making its point.This book is possibly the most valuable, usable, and accessible read I've seen explaining the ground rules for using data to overcome oppression and to grow knowledge which ""co-liberates"" researchers, those stuck in systematically oppressive tasks, and those harmed by oppressive actions.I do have a minor rhetorical critique with the way this book discusses and qualifies oppression. The book could be read in a way which uncritically trusts all emotional reactions to data as a kind of oppression. While I think there is some labor by the authors to show how to avoid this, on page 57, the inductive narrative is that people know they are being oppressed before the data shows it, which is true. There is a rise in critical scholarship showing how there are false positives with this kind of induction that should be taken seriously. For example, often Evangelical Christians see themselves as an oppressed group when they actively are enraged by not having the right to be the policy makers, the moral gatekeepers, i.e. the oppressors. Also there are many examples of people ""feeling"" other people's pain in research without material connection to it, and thus the actual pains happening are misaccounted, misdiagnosed, and cause even deeper harms. Similarly, there's a recent trend of discussing what's been called the oppression of ""white woman tears"" which also should be examined closely in these contexts. While the authors seem to have no intention of empowering potential false positives, one could easily use this book's actionable methodology of doing data science to so this. So it would have been nice to see a little more about how to avoid these cases in more appropriate locations.Additionally, while I understand the intention of the sections on data visualization, some of the discussion there pushes towards arguing towards possibly unethical uses of data manipulation. The book explicitly justifies how data visualization and data sets are not neutral and attempts to make them appear ""objective"" are merely an aesthetic of ""objectivity"" which is a psychological trick rather than actual objectivity. I agree with all of this, but I think more could have been shown to qualify the differences between the use of emotion in data visualization for scientific good and data manipulation. Is there a good place where we can draw the line? Where is the line between appealing to emotions and psychological manipulation? The book appears to want us to read it in good faith here and hopes that people will know where the moral line is. Perhaps we don't actually know yet, but this book opens these questions for me and I wished there were answers or at least a caveat about misuse of data visualizations."
21,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32284609-greta,No Rating,"I have published a long text on data feminism in my blog post which you can find here.Also, you can find a much shorter version here. Just expect some spoilers (if you can spoil non-fiction) :)First of all - a very VERY good book. I've never really thought about data science through the (intersectional) feminist lens. Not that I know much of data science but willing to change it :) 'a central aim of this book is to describe a form of intersectional feminism that takes the inequities of the present moment as its starting point and begins its own work by asking: How can we use data to remake the world?' (p. 5)One of the great advantages of this book is its accessibility without being simplistic or reductive. It might be different to someone who's not familiar with feminism but even then, I believe, over the course of reading, it would become clear what it's about. Data feminism, then, is: 'a way of thinking about data, both their uses and their limits, that is informed by direct experience, by a commitment to action, and by intersectional feminist thought.' (p. 8)It tries to understand the inequalities produced and reinforced by data science and challenge them by data science itself. Moreover, its core belief is that of co-liberation - an idea that the basis of social issues is due to prevailing inequalities. Thus, drawing on bell hooks, D'Ignazio and Klein argue that data feminism is for everybody and it is about power. The book is then divided into 7 chapters and each of them corresponds to one of the guiding principles of data feminism. I will briefly try to summarize what I have taken from each of it:	1. Examine power		a. Think of who has power and answer these three questions:			i. Data science by whom?			ii. Data science for whom?			iii. Data science with whose interests and goals?	2. Challenge power it 'requires mobilizing data science to push back against existing and unequal power structures and to work toward more just and equitable futures.' (p. 53)			i. They make an interesting distinction later on between being 'just' and 'ethical'. Being ethical, hence, is not enough to resist structural inequalities as it would assume there are some bad apples (people or tech) rather than that there's a structural issue. However, it's a good starting point to move towards justice. 	3. Elevate emotion and embodiment		a. Focus on data visualisation (and visceralization) 			i. It doesn't show 'objective' truth  'The belief that universal objectivity should be our goal is harmful because it's always only partially put into practise.' (p. 83) 			ii. Emotion (or affect) is important to consider		b. Think of data visualization as rhetoric	4. Rethink binaries and hierarchies		a. Counts only what gets counted		b. 'when a community is counting for itself, about itself, there is the potential that data collection can not only be empowering but also healing.' (p. 120)	5. Embrace pluralism		a. Value the diversity of positions		b. 'There is a story about how every evidence-based argument comes into being, and it is often a story that involves money and institutions, as well as humans and tools. Revealing this story through transparency and reflexivity can be a feminist act.' (p. 137)			i. Hence, reflexivity is crucial		c. It's not enough just to use data for good, one should use it for co-liberation	6. Consider context 'Big Dick Data is a formal, academic term that we, the authors, have coined to denote big data projects that are characterized by masculinist, totalizing fantasies of world domination as enacted through data capture and analysis. Big Dick Data projects ignore context, fetishize size, and inflate their technical and scientific capabilities.' (p. 151)			i. Context is also important when communicating and framing the data			ii. Thinking of 'raw' data production can also be a feminist strategy	7. Make labor visible		a. Often designing a data product, many contributors remain invisible and uncredited as we tend to credit only the work we see 			i. Also think of all the emotional, affective, and care work that is done but usually goes unnoticed		b. Cultural data work - describes the work, often invisible, done by people who are responsible for moderating content online, for example by ensuring that FB feed is free of child pornography 		c. The emergence of data production studies might help to uncover and challenge power dynamics by tracing down the roots of algorithms and visualizations back to the human and material sourcesSo here it is. I've done my best to keep it short as well as understandable. I don't really have much of a critique but that sometimes I did feel a bit bored. I think it's because I'm familiar with feminism and some points/ideas seemed common-sense. It doesn't undermine the importance of the book and I will come back to it, especially for the examples it uses. Some of them that I consider especially interesting are:	1. anatomyof.ai	2. womenstats  3. antieviction map"
22,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5704114-becca,Rating 4 out of 5,"pleasantly surprised by this. there is a lot of intellectual handholding re: intersectional feminist values / methods BUT the introduction and description of ideas is effective and only at times reductive. the chapters are well constructed and a very readable primer for critical information studies for presumably a STEM audience. not sure about the citation audit at the end — I haven’t seen anything like it in other academic works I’ve read but its methods clash unpleasantly with its (self admitted) argument about the challenges of ANY identity-based classification system / audit. the authors do a fantastic history of the idea of “data” itself being rooted in ideology but it doesn’t quite escape the cycle by prioritizing this number-based citation audit instead of other formats.if everything is data, then nothing is data, and is a data scientist the same thing as a historian by another name, imbued with different cultural meaning and value?still, mostly fantastic. recommending to my mother ✅"

The definition of feminism in the book title is beyond gender and stresses the importance of addressing intersectionality. I am especially impressed by the efforts of the authors and researchers in creating metrics to guide the writing process as an attempt to address structural problems such as racism and patriarchy by, for example, including examples and citations from people of colours and women. This is so much needed!"

From the first chapters of Data Feminism I already noticed that I started thinking about data differently and that I wanted to share my insights with people around me. While strongly focused on the North American context, I immediately saw ways that I could apply the principles of data feminism in my own work and it more or less pulled me out of an academic slump that I didn’t really know I was in. Anyone working with data, please read this book. Please. 🙏🏻"

The read was interesting, the authors have done an excellent job at not only tying together a multitude of topics but also ensuring they are engaging. The authors dive into positionally and at times their focus on it can come across as covering their bases and lacking genuineness. Despite this, the authors have explored this topic from many angles and tried to include as many voices as possible - it’s definitely worth a read if it’s an area you are unfamiliar with. My largest criticism is that it is incredibly western and American focused, nothing new or unexpected here. There was a lot of work done within the initial chapters of this book to place themselves within a hegemonic discourse and pay tribute to marginalised voices - but the coverage of the book certainly didn’t extend itself to ensure the burgeoning issues related to gender gaps in the “developing” world.

But I'm continuing to read it over lunch breaks in 2022, and I'm finding plenty of interesting material to think about and incorporate into my own work.Also, my friend Dr. Cagle has published a review of it!~~~Putting it on the ""paused-reading"" shelf for 2022-23 school year, but finally made time to finish it in May 2023.Well written with many many excellent examples, some of which I am slowly starting to cover in my own courses. Since this is my first exposure to some of these ideas, I don't always understand or agree with some of the material, but it is certainly encouraging me to learn more. And even just at the broadest level, it is clear that a good statistician or data scientist ideally asks many of the same questions as e.g. a feminist scholar does, and our communities should work together more often:-- Who has the power here? (who collected the data, wrote the question, funded the research, had the time and education to get the tech skills needed to analyze it, etc)-- Who benefits? (from this data's existence, or from this analysis or visualization taking the approach it does and making the conclusions it does)-- Who is left out? (where are the gaps in the target pop, the sampling frame, the sampling design, the people who chose to respond, the people who had the language and tech skills and time to respond, etc... and in the subgroup analyses who is left out entirely or pooled together with a larger group, etc)-- Is this a sincere attempt to learn about the world, or are the authors fooling others and/or themselves? (was the study and analysis designed carefully to avoid known pitfalls in such methodology, or did people either unwittingly or deliberately neglect to address missing data, bias in the data collection, sampling variation and the risk of ""trends"" just being noise in this one sample, statistical methods and graphic summaries that mislead when applied to certain types of data for certain purposes, etc)I do have to admit that in a few (very few!) places it felt a little bit like a non-technical person writing about technical details, and I'm not sure why since the authors clearly do have years of technical expertise. Example: in Ch 5 when they picked on the name of ""tidy data"" and the tidyverse set of R software packages. I agree with their point that not all data needs to be tidy, and I can see how the wording ""tidy"" could imply pejorative things about non-tidy data... But at the same time, whenever it IS possible & meaningful to compare apples to apples, we do need to have tools with which to do so, and tidyverse is just one such tool. No sense in complaining that a carpenter owns a hammer as long as they are not trying to use the hammer for unsuitable tasks. Railing against the tidyverse because of its name (""tidy"" means exerting control & dominance, and removing complexity!) , rather than because of what it actually does (taking complex data and restructuring them slightly to allow you to do new analyses with them WITHOUT losing that complexity), misses the mark in my eyes. Not sure how this ended up in the book, since it's clear the authors are experienced statisticians themselves. Maybe the publisher's editorial staff tried to shorten a paragraph and dropped some key nuance by mistake, if the author were aiming at the *rhetoric* around data cleaning in news articles etc. rather than around a nondescript tool.Unfortunately it was published less than a year (I think) before Timnit Gebru was fired by Google. That was an important event which touched on so many of the issues in the book, and I'm sure will be covered if there is ever a second edition of this book."
36,no user info,Rating 3 out of 5,"(review updated 2021-04-10)'data feminism' is an important book that has the potential to open many eyes to harms that can be perpetuated by data work. it opens with a clear and concise introduction to intersectional feminism, using numerous concrete examples that data scientists will easily grasp. the writing is fairly dense, but it is engaging, and i learned a lot.in my mind there are two issues that keep the treatment in 'data feminism' from being definitive. the first has to do with the largely missing discussion of values. 'data feminism' demonstrates how data science contributes to systematic oppression, and argues compellingly that the goal of data science should be to achieve co-liberation, justice and equity. so far, so good. if all data projects could work towards co-liberation, justice and equity, what a wonderful thing that would be. in practice, though, data projects (or really research and science in general) often have multiple aims. it is often impossible to simultaneously achieve these other aims while working towards co-liberation and justice and equity, and we are left with the task of prioritizing amongst multiple incompatible aims.'data feminism' does not provide readers with any tools here; there is a laudable and necessary focus on algorithmic justice, but no discussion or framework for understanding how feminist values might tradeoff with non-feminist values. you can see this, for example, in the critique of matthew desmond's data sourcing, in the inconsistent attitude about when measurement and categorization are acceptable at all, and in that fact there are no examples of how to ethically make money using data science. because of this i think many of people who might get the most out of this book will have difficulty understanding how the principles in the 'data feminism' apply to their own projects, other than to suggest that they should stop working on them entirely.the second reason that i think people will struggle with 'data feminism' is the difficulty of quantitatively operationalizing injustice. originally, i perceived this as a sort of confounding of bad modeling and structural oppression on the part of the authors; now i think of it as a hard (and rather technical) modeling problem. this change in viewpoint was the result of a presentation by dr. razieh nabi on fair and unfair pathways in causal graphs, and i am convinced her work provides the appropriate tools to define and partition (causal) estimands into just and unjust components. on this view, causal mediation analysis is a necessary tool for inference in many of the settings present in the book, but one that is missing from 'data feminism'. as a result 'data feminism' makes some claims that i (1) totally agree with, and (2) find methodologically unsupported (see figure 6.6). relatedly, there are a number of passages that don't quite claim that the data is wrong and do not represent the real world, but they certainly come rhetorically close (for example, the discussion of the COMPAS recidivism classifier). when 'data feminism' papers over these holes rhetorically rather than quantitatively, i think it limits its potential audience.this is all to say that, while 'data feminism' is not definitive, it is a valuable book and quantitative researchers, data scientists and people working in tech should all read it as a starting point"

39,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21906279-kathleen-littleton,Rating 3 out of 5,"This is a difficult book to read. It is difficult because the line length is too long. This might seem to be petty but line length is a 100-level data design concept. The authors have proposed to operate at the 400 or graduate level without an understanding of fundamental concepts. This is the most obvious but not the only instance of this in their work.The ideas they raise should be considered by data designers. They are interesting and important. However, lenses can both clarify and obscure. The authors' lens does blind them on some issues. Data cleaning, for example. Chapter 5 is against and Chapter 6, although it uses other words, is for it. It may well be that the authors do not understand the full extent of the process of data cleaning and don't realize that the inclusion of metadata is part of data cleaning. I would recommend this book only to experienced data designers who can recognize and compensate for the fundemental flaws while considering the ideas raised. "

So much so that these general problems are explaind for it general consequences, and not in how each particular problem affects women. Though it is interesting and well documented, I was looking for something more specific to women. I believe that trying to make feminism the mother of all lost causes can sometimes, at the end, invisibilize women. And I think it happened to some degree in this book."
41,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/91261074-chris-esposo,Rating 4 out of 5,"At first, this book read less as a book on the intersections of computing and ideological or social theory, and more of a natural extension of the data/AI ethics movement that had emerged to prominence just a few years back. This related, but distinct field first came to prominence when ‘blind spots’ were identified with many machine learning systems that supported popular apps/Web 2.0 services. These systems were found to exhibit widely differential performance/accuracies in several use-cases (and in the case of object/image classification, offensive) which had an apparent conditioning on race, gender, and other “protected classes” as defined by the 1964 Civil Rights Act. However, after getting through the introductory material, the authors, Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren Klein reveal their “pitch” to data scientist that their work, whether it’s implementing algorithms, crafting systems, or visualizing data, should not be viewed purely within the purview of the dispassionate positivist eye, but should be thought of as an extension of normative work, where ethics, history, context etc, are leveraged to inform the work at all stages of the development cycle. 	Much of the text is organized by chapters as a way to expand upon the author’s “7 Principles of Data Feminism” and they include: Examine powerChallenge powerWork towards justice.Elevate emotion & embodimentRethink binaries & hierarchiesEmbrace pluralismConsider contextMake labor visible	These are more or less in order of complexity, but if I were to restate holistically what I read the authors are asking data scientist to not take their data as given, to understand that the manufacturing of the data was itself not a dispassionate process that is free of bias (“there’s no such thing as raw data”), and to use this “extra information” to make informed decisions on how to proceed with the transformation/analysis/’operationalization’ of the data within the context of whatever system they are operating in, and feeding the data into. Many data workers will likely retort “duh, I already check for potential statistical biases, to help understand how generalizable my model likely is/how efficient it may be etc.”. The authors however, ask to go beyond that, and to use your human ethics to understand how it is that the data got to that state, and then to craft a system to mitigate that directly. Here, they are asking you to not just acknowledge an injustice, but to challenge it, and the power that is responsible for it. 	Throughout the text, there are examples where the production of the data is made explicit by, say actually visiting the places that it reflects (say a neighborhood for demographic data as a Harvard statistics course is instructed to do to both gather data and to help understand the context of that data). It’s clear this may not always be practical, but the sentiment is definitely appreciated here. Too many data scientists, especially younger/newer individuals who are coming into the field have an understanding of tech stack, or some of the methodology, but without the context, they are effectively deploying apparatus by rote. It is exactly this process that is likely to create system-issues either from an ethical perspective or an operational aspect, as miscodings go by unnoticed or spurious correlations are taken as actual evidence for an underlying mechanism. 	Though system design is really just a minor part of the topics, much of the examples are focused on either understanding the data production (prior to formal data-cleaning/pre-processing) or visualizing/communicating analysis/system results/output. Here the author's ethical-bent really shines through as they suggest to essentially throw out standard data visualization canon, which again is developed to mimic the positivists/dispassionate purview, and to emphasize elements that will compel your consumer towards “towards justice” (or “truth” say in a more ‘positivist’ application domain like particle physics). In effect, the authors are asking you to not ignore the agency of your consumers, and most importantly, to not forget your own agency as the “storyteller”. I don’t recall explicit design principles/elements outlined, but there are at least a few dozen examples of infographics/interactive artifacts that give the reader a good idea of what these things mean in practice (at least from the author’s purview). 	I felt the general premise outlined in this book is mostly sound. There are a lot of points of ambiguity and much of that has to do with the application-domain (society/social science/people), which have always been more challenging from an analytic perspective. The authors are not outlining a formal theory, so whether contradictions may exist in certain applications (or may arise from those applications) are not the point. The point of this text (I believe) is to empower the reader (most likely a data scientist or researcher) to not look at their subject matter from just the one view of “science” (or statistics/mathematics) but to take it into context, to challenge the predispositions of the data, and to also factor your own dispositions into the analysis (to go “meta” as it were). This will definitely add cognitive load to the worker’s daily task, and it’s much easier to reduce one’s thinking to which hidden layers to stack together for a certain classifier. However, this is the job, if you are one of the few individuals tasked to work on such a system with such a wide coverage of impact, you should definitely be thinking about the ramifications of your work very carefully. Definitively recommended this to anyone joining (or in) the field."

This is how an academic book should be translated for the general public. I want to follow their template of disclosure, transparency, and acknowledge biases and limitations in the presentation of their work and what they did to bridge those gaps. A highly self-aware project highlighting the invisible structures and people behind the rise of data and the problems of how to interrogate the assets as well as how to articulate how best to interpret them in a just, fair, equitable manner. The best thing is, this work is open access. Downloadable. What more can you ask for!The project is about transparency and what it means for us general readers and the specialist audience. The first few chapters are the most important as the authors define what data or even what feminism means. If you need a short, succinct overview of the literature, this is the chapter you need. Nothing too heavy but also not light. The authors are excellent in defining terms and referring to the latest in academic research on the topics and theories without overburdening the reader. I suggest people who want to understand gender theory and feminist theory (mostly what they are not) read their summary and overview. If you are selectively reading the chapters for specific reasons, please don't skip the footnotes. Most of the links are live and updated so it is highly appreciated and you don't have to get lost going back to the text and the references. Very smooth. They thought about the reading experience so it is highly appreciated. So, this is not about women or feminists only. Sadly the title may turn off a significant portion of the population including me due to the misuse of this term that has so far lost its meaning. So it was important for them to define it. It encompasses not only a focus on women but a broader set of minority populations and groups and the unequal access they experience in the system. So it is not just about women but all groups who have been marginalised in the current economy - it covers gender, class, and race in all its cultural interpretation.  The chapters will resound depending on what interests you may have at the moment - design justice, civic transformation, tech for good. This is a book that people in different professions in the design industry should read - researchers, designers, developers, engineers, and managers. Students looking for projects or wanting to enact change using technology. I myself really appreciate Chapter 6 on the problem of context of data. This is so relevant for my practice as big data sets need to be interrogated for their context and limitations. This crosses over to my main job as a researcher and what to ask data teams and what proxies they use certain parameters for. This book has helped me shape the kind of questions we need to be asking and what implications they have to what we know. There are weak chapters such as the gender chapter which I think a discussion on sports data would generate more in-depth discussion on why certain sports allow transgender athletes e.g. weight lifting and why others are not i.e. running. It would have been a good examination of the physical and social implications of numbers used in sports and its interpretations. Just a food for thought but most likely out of this book's purview. There are even more interesting short films and articles linked in the footnotes so highly suggest readers who want to go in depth to check them out. This is a landmark book for change in data management and how we should approach current big data collection, management, distribution, and consumption technologies."
44,no user info,Rating 3 out of 5,"star rating:3 ★I gave ""Data Feminism"" three stars. The book starts with the author's view of data with the quote, ""Data is the new oil"". She investigates the implications of data on the human population through the perspective of women scientists. While she does not argue against the science behind data, she instead uses the book as a way to provide methodologies, examples, and principles to back up her theory on how data science can be reimagined as a way to advocate for justice in society. I like how inspiring the author writes, and it gives the reader a sense of passion as she appeals to our ethos by painting our world as corrupt from the actions of politicians, and white male scientists who are stuck in their old-fashioned ways of thinking. She addresses these relations of power and invokes the reader to take action, and promises a better future for those who feel unseen in the STEM field. I gave this book three stars, because I felt this book was enough to pique my interest, as this is the first data related science book I read. I don't necessarily have a passion for non-fiction books, but this book was definitely in my zone of interest. I like how she discusses the social configuration of our society through the lens of data, from an analytical standpoint. She means to write this book for everyone, but as I've seen some of the reviews would say it is only from one perspective, and some may get offended if they are judged based on their social standing. I also felt like the writing was somewhat hard to decipher at times, and it felt like reading a lab report, with a very strict and straightforward writing style. Aside from my rating of the book, my favorite quote in the book was this one: “Those who wield power are disproportionately elite, straight, white, ablebodied, cisgender men from the Global North” (pg.8). I like this book a lot as it just shows the author's opinion, and really points out the fact that white males dominate the field of data, and the author wants to change that fact. She uses the word ""disproportionately"" to justify the inequality of gender. She then continues on to say that this should be fixed, we are far enough into the modern world to have problems with the bias surrounding gender acting as a barrier in some jobs. Summary: The book combines the ideas of ""intersectional feminism"" with a methodological approach to data science. The author does a great job of incorporating acts of feminism in her writing, as a way to spark passion in the reader's life and give them a new perspective. The book provides an introduction to ideas such as bias in machine learning, community-led data practices, and new knowledge surrounding society-based norms, from an analytical standpoint. The chapters of the book are organized into seven principles: examine power, challenge power, elevate emotion and embodiment, rethink binaries and hierarchies, embrace pluralism, consider context, and make labor visible. This book can be read by anyone, and the author does include everyone in her data when she begins to expand on her research. This book is also a great example of a piece of modern day feminism in the works. One of the main themes the author does try to highlight in her book is one of self-awareness. As she brings up these norms that society has deemed ""acceptable"" it forces the reader to ask themselves if that's right or wrong, or if they had just followed with the majority. Another theme is ""be the source of change"", as throughout the book she continues to inspire the reader with new ways in which they could be the change that could help the modern world improve and implement a new way of thinking.

The Illustrator's Notebook
: leaving large margins alongside the text where readers could fill in their own thoughts. This implies that books should be viewed as living documents filled with the history of the people who have read them—even viewing margin notes as their own books. I don't know if that was a goal that Professors D'Ignazio and Klein had in mind, but I appreciated their/the publisher's choice to typeset this with wide margins, because I seemed to fill every couple pages with thoughts. With so many points to choose from, any attempt to review this as a whole will feel incomplete. But Professor D'Ignazio spoke at the social informatics colloquium last week and I had a few of my questions answered, so it's probably time to record my thoughts.The authors reorganize the field of data science from a feminist perspective. To do this, they incorporate perspectives from design, critical views, open access movements, and applications of former principles (heavily drawn from GIS and spatial statistics). This is organized by introducing historic feminist literature, suggesting how those can be incorporated in a data science workflow, and challenging some goals of science/visualization more broadly.Their third chapter on ""Rational, Scientific, Objective Viewpoints"" had me wondering whether my understanding of data visualization has been limited previously. Visualizations on paper seem to inherit the detached interest that papers seem to have, but physical objects can often communicate data in ways that provoke emotion (the authors seemed pro-visualizations-should-often-have-an-emotional-component, which immediately had me thinking about memorials like those in Washington D.C. that use space and scale to emphasize the number of the dead or the costs of wars). I'm still curious about how much of this is a problem of the tools available to us. People in my academic orbit have likely heard me complain about visualization toolkits on several occasions (I'm currently using cytoscape for graphs, a mix of matplotlib/plotly/seaborn for general statistical plots, and tikz for presentation); i.e. the landscape seems incomplete. Perhaps projects like Makie that try to remerge data visualization back into computer graphics will have this solved in a few years.Finally, Isabel Carter's endnote on auditing the book, and the authors' reflection on ""Holding Ourselves Accountable"" was something I wish more authors did. Usually the publishing process (peer reviews and editing) gives authors time to reflect and improve on their work, but there's no way for anyone else to get a window into that process. Overall, this book gave words to some of the things I'd been thinking about recently, and I've loved recommending this to people and taking part in some conversations it's inspired."

This is not usually intentional; it comes from the ignorance of being on top. We describe this deficiency as a privilege hazard.How does this come to pass? Let’s take a minute to imagine what life is like for someone who epitomizes the dominant group in data science: a straight, white, cisgender man with formal technical credentials who lives in the United States. When he looks for a home or applies for a credit card, people are eager for his business. People smile when he holds his girlfriend’s hand in public. His body doesn’t change due to childbirth or breastfeeding, so he does not need to think about workplace accommodations. He presents his social security number in jobs as a formality, but it never hinders his application from being processed or brings him unwanted attention. The ease with which he traverses the world is invisible to him because it has been designed for people just like him. He does not think about how life might be different for everyone else. In fact, it is difficult for him to imagine that at all.The privilege hazard occurs at the level of the individual—in the interpersonal domain of the matrix of domination—but it is much more harmful in aggregate because it reaches the hegemonic, disciplinary and structural domains as well.Of course, this inaction would not have been tolerated without the assistance of the hegemonic domain—the realm of media and culture—which presents men as strong and women as subservient, men as public and women as private, trans people as deviating from “essential” norms, and nonbinary people as nonexistent altogether.Put crudely, there is no profit to be made collecting data on the women who are dying in childbirth, but there is significant profit in knowing whether women are pregnant."

It felt like the first half of the book was devoted to teaching the reader about concepts in equality and fairness rather than looking at data specifically - and it wasn't just a matter of equality of genders, but looked at the theory behind equality across race, class, sexual orientation, nations, etc. It was a bit of a pain to get through because that wasn't what the book was supposed to be about. At the end of the day, I like reading about those ideas, but if I'm reading a book about data I want it to be, well, about data. Even though I had a rocky start with the book, I grew more interested about a quarter of the way through when the authors started to speak about data visualization and the neutrality or lack thereof within it. They make an interesting point that there's a rhetorical position present in every design, and an alleged impartiality can sometimes be a rhetorical standpoint of occlusion. Honestly, the work around data visualization was he coolest part of the book. There were a couple of other dimensions along the way that i found problematic and frankly lacking in feminism. The authors identified weaknesses in data science because of its lack of emotion and community involvement, tacitly suggesting these are female traits. I think this kind of conversation in terms of what 'feminist' data science values and 'non-feminist' data science values are inherently divides the world into the rational male and the emotional female and that's pretty unhelpful. And a couple of other things rattled me, like the sentence, 'Before moving forward, we find it important to acknowledge that these ideas about cleanliness and control contain troubling traces of a movement from a prior era: eugenics, the upsetting, nineteenth-century source of much of modern statistics.' - I mean, that's taking things too far. Cleanliness and control are a matter of making information digestible. There's no ulterior motive. It feels like it's taking the spotlight away from real issues in data science to make these pseudo connections. "

D'Ignazio is an Assistant Professor of Urban Science and Planning at MIT; Klein is an Associate Professor in Departments of English and Quantitative Theory & Methods at Emory University. Both are versed in data science and its ethical underpinnings. I attended a book talk by the second author on September 10, 2021. The talk's recording is now available.https://onlineethics.org/events/data-... Data is power, and that power is wielded by the elite, consisting primarily of white men. This is where feminism comes in. The imbalance of power in data collection leads to missing data sets. Intersectional feminism, when applied to data science, can help that power be challenged and changed. The book's missing-data aspects overlap with Caroline Criado Perez's Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed for Men, which I have previously discussed in my 5-star review:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... Data feminism is based on seven principles, which are quite easy to agree with, although the term ""feminism"" turns some people off at the outset. The principles are: Examine power; Challenge power; Elevate emotion & embodiment; Rethink binaries & hierarchies; Embrace pluralism; Consider context; Make labor visible. These seven principles from the book are also elaborated upon in the article ""Seven Intersectional Feminist Principles for Equitable and Actionable COVID-19 Data"" (Big Data & Society, Vol. 7, No. 2, July 2020).I recommend the book and the just-cited article highly. Given the central role of data in our modern world, perhaps no domain is more worthy of our attention than ensuring equitable participation of all stakeholders in data science and in entities dealing with the collection and interpretation of data.Open-access on-line copy of the book: https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/466...

49,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9477823-mekon,Rating 4 out of 5,"It's an enjoyable and worthwhile book - but I'm going to have to echo the thoughts that Sanjida put in her excellent review ( https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... )So to state my position: I'm a programmer with no training in data science who sometimes deals with large and varied data sets. I live in the UK. I'm middle aged and middle income. I'm non-white and non-conforming in terms of gender expression and sexuality.I found the book to be interesting and informative. Many of the examples given triggered little 'aha' moments as I read - for example the mapping of property prices in relation to Google's staff bus stops.I think something about the feminist framing of everything made the whole text fall between two stools, diluting its impact and restricting the potential readership.I know the authors set out with targets to draw in examples from outside of academia and from a global pool of underrepresented groups. Despite this, there a hugely US-centric feel to the whole book. In particular its handling of race, where people are categorised as Black, white, Latinx and brown (their capitalization) clumsily applied as a universal rule. It was also odd to see The Guardian and The Telegraph, two British newspapers at opposing ends of political opinion, getting casually lumped together.Still, I enjoyed and learnt from this book. Accessing it directly through The MIT Press Open meant it was easy to follow links from the footnotes and explore some of the sources involved. I'd certainly see it as more of a jumping-off point than a self-contained read."
50,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"There is truly something for everyone in this book.A central question to this book that the authors ask is, “How can we use data to remake the world?” The authors set out to answer this question by asking more questions (as researchers tend to do) about the way in which we deal with collecting, analyzing and interpreting data and how these actions are influenced by power structures, privilege hazard, data ethics and data justice. The book also centers the concept of intersectionality (which is what we’ve seen throughout most, if not all, the books that we’ve read thus far) & idea of co-liberation, where “the idea of oppressive systems of power harm all of us, that they undermine the quality and validity of our work, and that they hinder us from creating true and lasting social impact with data science.”We all work with data, whether you're a data scientist, journalist, public health professional, banker, tech person - and we work with different kinds of data all the time. I think as we move forward with technology, AI, etc., intersectionality should be a major consideration. The book opened the door to so many concepts and projects out there doing the ground work in making sure the data we're receiving is as accurate and accessible as possible. It also shed light on a lot of creativity related to data science."
51,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/150951922-takuya-kitazawa,Rating 4 out of 5,"Data feminism is not only about gender but also all about human biases in data. Most importantly, the book is a great reminder of the fact that any kind of data is created, collected, and processed by people. That is, a lineage of data is always contextualized in a certain situation from their origin to final deliverables such as data product, visualization, and business decisions. Therefore, data practitioners must not overlook human aspects of the data they are working on, even though it takes more effort and time.What makes the book crucial is that the seven principles of data feminism (examine power, challenge power, elevate emotion and embodiment, rethink binaries and hierarchies, embrace pluralism, consider context, and make labor visible) have been introduced in an actionable form. The authors not just criticized bad (yet widely accepted) practices of data science but discussed how we can approach complex, contextualized datasets in a more humane way. They even exercised the data feminist practices throughout the writing process of the book (e.g., careful choices of words and conscious decisions on which information sources to cite) and demonstrated both the effectiveness and limitations.A must-read for everyone who works on data. I should have known about this book earlier."

I certainly found some beautiful lines/quotations and great new formulations for how to think & speak about these topics in my workplace.My main question mark about it is that I'm not entirely sure who the audience is. If it's people with a background in feminist/intersectionality theory, it's fundamentally pretty basic info (although the examples used to illustrate them are certainly interesting, albeit a few have that undergrad ""I randomly picked something to use as an example in my paper and it's due tomorrow, so we're just going with it ok"" vibe). If it's data scientists who don't care about intersectionality, I suspect it won't convince them. But if you're somewhere in the middle or on one side with interest in the other.Also, this book ignores the ideology that fuels data today. In a flawless feminist liberal approach, structural oppression is characterized as a ""privilege hazard,"" ignoring a serious analysis of the economic framework where technology is situated today to fortress those oppressions."
53,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"Excellent book applying feminist concepts to the world of data. It is both well-written and interesting, with a host of examples emphasizing how thoughtful we need to be when thinking about getting and using data and how so much of the data we have is used for purposes it was not intended or fails to capture critical information. As said in the book in the context of 'data for good' initiatives, ""Doing good with data requires being deeply attuned to the things that fall outside the dataset and in particular to how datasets and the data science they enable too often reflect the structures of power of the world they draw from. In a world defined by unequal power relations.... who gets to do the good and who, conversely, gets someone else's good done to them."" Overall, would highly recommend to anyone interested in data. Without an appreciation of these structures it is easy to think of data as objective, correct, and 'telling you things' (e.g. What does the data say?) and thinking this way is both wrong and highly problematic for society."
54,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"I read a bunch of books on ethics of technology, this one is especially efficient in getting to the main points. It's also don't shy of getting ""political"" - in fact, a main message is that all data analysis are political, whether we're aware of it or not. The edit is great and the authors practice what they preach, meaning they were carful to curate diverse sources and examples, so I learned a lot of new things. I also liked the positive spirit of emphasizing what I, as a data scientist, can do better (though being American they tend to overstate the power of individuals and small groups to make a change).I think that the most important principle of this book is that data professionals must always *consider context* in their work and never assume that the data speak for itself. This message should be burned in our minds, even if we don't embrace the entire Data Feminism paradigm. I'd like to see the authors elaborate in more technical and professional details on the best practices to do so. In fact, this should probably be an open source, community project 😎"
55,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/90432444-roshni-sahoo,Rating 5 out of 5,"i like chapter 2, chapter 5, chapter 6 the most. the book definitely made me think about 1) why certain objectives are prioritized in the machine learning community 2) the importance of the context of a dataset, and 3) made me realize HOW MUCH WORK good data science research for social impact requires.Other tech + society books and articles I read focus a lot on the problems— gender data gaps or failure cases of automated systems but I liked that this group provided initial steps that we can take for more responsible data science. I can imagine that some people might find their steps obvious (examine the context that a dataset originates from, recognize the invisible labor that goes into research (e.g. MTurkers!), stop trying to classify people into restrictive, static categories) but it’s literally so common to just plug in any dataset without thinking about where it came from and also why is classification such a popular task in the ML community ??

I loved how the authors highlighted various data science projects from underrepresented communities and showed projects that used nontraditional forms of data representation. The tables explaining the authors’ theoretical framework balance the narrative examples well, and the captions explaining the figures’ scope and the authors’ reason for including the figures are succinct and effective. Lastly, the end of the book includes a refreshing audit of the project: The authors revisit their project values. They compare aspirational metrics on regarding race, gender, ability, etc. to the citations and examples that actually ended up in the published version. And finally, they acknowledge community partners and emphasize how much collaborative effort the book entailed."

The authors offer a good set of heuristic guidelines for reading into data sets and their interpretation/uptake. Later guidelines in the book could be used to guide the responsible, equitable, and inclusive collection and analysis of different or competing data sets. I found the book to be very heavy on critique and the apparatus of critique, sometimes at the expense of being clear about how to build better data. However, to be fair, building in critique through the systematic valuation of multiple voices/perspectives/situations IS part of how we do better. Chapters 5 and 6 offer a bit more clarity (for me) about how to proceed. "
58,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49156181-jon-holdship,Rating 4 out of 5,A really interesting and enlightening read that just falls short by being far too academic.The introduction and 7 numbered chapters each has a solid message as well as some really interesting examples of the problem they describe and/or work that shows what could be done instead.It's a fantastic read for anyone interested in data and feminism. It just fails at the advertised goal of bringing feminism to data science by offering nothing practical for practitioners.Every example of good data science the authors give is from a university or community based project doing work in a way that would be impractical for most DS settings.I'd believe the authors if they said no good examples from industry exist but it is then on them to tell us how to translate the learning from academic projects to regular data science work.
59,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"I highly recommend this book to anyone who works with data (and really even to people who don’t). It looks as data analysis, visualization, reporting, documentation, etc. through the lens of intersectional feminism. The authors provide a framework for using data to help combat rather than reinforce structural oppression. Although the authors are white, they try to practice what they preach and ensure that diverse voices and view points are represented throughout. The book is published on glossy paper so that the featured visualizations in each chapter are beautifully reproduced. There are a number of fascinating projects highlighted throughout that I look forward to exploring in more detail. "
60,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23515305-eileen-breseman,Rating 3 out of 5,"Point taken about how data can mislead. The authors lay out the premise in 5 segments and give examples and details to show who collects and distributes the data, in what form it is presented can easily skip marginalized groups (not just women as the title implies) that have not had a voice in it, and how it is collected and used. In some setups that are meant to be a blind unbiased AI algorithms, it can tend to skew the information further based on what is already in the system. Much is unconsciously done unless the data takers and analyzers are sensitized to those biases. I got a bit bogged down on the academic level of it, but overall this tells a truism that needs to inform those that get information from data - as in all of us."

Sadly, I used to believe that numbers spoke for themselves and that numbers never lie. But not anymore. Now I can't look at visual representations of data without wondering I am seeing the real picture or not. Now I know that everything from who collects the data to how it is collected and presented matters. The book brings in intersectional feminism to study how data is not as objective as it looks.A big thank you to the authors and everyone involved with the book for making it available for free. "

The book is well-outlined and clearly written and would probably be a great introductory textbook for a freshman-level or survey college course.My only criticism is the lack of projects from beyond the US.

As someone who consults on data infrastructure and ethics I feel I learned loads from reading this book and that it is not just interesting but very practical. I don't have much background in feminist studies so it might be somewhat basic to people steeped in that knowledge but I found the connection between feminist theory and data work to be clear, very useful and grounded in helpful real world examples.

The authors make a lot of great points about how past methods of data analysis perpetuate inequalities in society. They bring up example after example concerning gender, race, and social class, and have specific examples of how they could be handled better. But the amount of information was overwhelming - once you get past the parts at the beginning that overlap with the Coded Bias documentary.

It felt overly broad and unfocused (using applications across intersectional identity).It’s important to have a critical eye when thinking about data and the data science process, definitely. But some sections came off as overly punitive towards the individual actor as opposed to the system that creates bad actors. The connection made between cleaning data and eugenics felt wacky.I’d suggest Invisible Women as a similar book that feels more focused."

102,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34832998-sian-a,Rating 4 out of 5,Interesting book packed full of interesting citations. More food for thought than concrete solutions though I did take away a few good and actionable ideas.
103,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11502692-prabhat,Rating 5 out of 5,I read this book as a part of a reading group hosted by authors. I did truly like the breadth of the book and definitely needs to be read together in a reading group.

122,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35391026-sakinareads,Rating 4 out of 5,"Read this for work. Good introduction to the area but I wouldn’t recommend to people who already know a bit about data feminism and data ethics, as I found this lacking depth "
123,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16155869-jind-ich-mynarz,Rating 4 out of 5,I believe this book is a sign that data science is maturing. I can imagine it being widely used as a text-book in data science curricula.

131,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/99283559-lilly-hannelore,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is a very good introduction to feminism in the modern context of data science. The authors follow an inclusive, intersectional approach that provides a food overview of the field."
132,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/160918583-merrimac-moran,Rating 4 out of 5,A refreshing intersectional lens on a rather dull subject matter. They bring data to life in regards to how it intersects and can benefit us in ways we didn’t think possible. 
133,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2186972-lauren-laker,Rating 5 out of 5,Everyone working in data needs to read this!
134,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/92606982-rebecca,Rating 5 out of 5,Read because it was on Yuvals 2023 book list. 
135,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66463029-rebecca,Rating 5 out of 5,"Excellent academic text meets worthwhile coffee table book. Absolutely the best & most important feminist text i’ve read - truly intersectional, delves beneath the superficial & demonstrates genuine solutions. "
136,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/109482937-victoria-timpanaro,Rating 5 out of 5,An excellent overview of combining digital humanities work with feminist ideals. The authors make you excited about the topic and inspire you to follow in the footsteps of the case studies. The writing is done clearly and concisely to help explain concepts of both feminism and digital work.
137,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38587001-grace,Rating 5 out of 5,"A lend from Nitya - I loved this book. I thought it did an incredible job keeping data vis contemporary & thought provoking. Relevant to any user of data (ie ALL of us), I found the chapter on metrics & accountability particularly useful for my work. "
138,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/130852286-m,Rating 5 out of 5,"I loved it when the authors said ‘this book is for everyone and about everyone’ because it really includes more than feminism. Taking in consideration all influencing factors is important in order to perform a thorough analysis. On another note, I want to take a moment to appreciate the visualizations included. They add to the point very well and enriches the explanation.For anyone who has read Invisible Women or plans to do after reading Data Feminism, I can honestly say that even though the main topic is similar, both books elaborate on different examples and unlike other books, there isn’t much repetition, so you’ll definitely enjoy reading both one after the other, no matter which first. "
139,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/833817-anthony,Rating 3 out of 5,"This is a well written academic book. The basic premise that feminism incorporates data feminism is well articulated. But the authors take for granted the coherency of the case for “co-liberation” the end goal of data science, and it makes for unconvincing reading in parts. As a book for those already on their side, it’s a good framework. But there will be lots of data scientists who aren’t convinced by their positions against neutrality and rationality. "
140,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/114814080-ratatouille,Rating 5 out of 5,"Really wonderful examples and interesting and clear dialogue. I especially appreciated the ending section that broke down the citation and references used to explain where these ""authoritative voices"" were coming from."
141,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,Excellent examples and relatively accessible reading for anyone interested in the subject! Probably most appropriate for data scientists. 
142,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13669006-mai,Rating 5 out of 5,"this was closer second read for a paper, but this book still finds ways to inspire me and spark connections between research projects <3"
143,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21160844-cynthia,Rating 2 out of 5,"This sadly does not question in any way the real issue at the core of data science, and only suggest solution steeped in white liberal ""equity"" and ""inclusion""."
