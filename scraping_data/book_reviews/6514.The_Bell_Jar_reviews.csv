0,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/103544-sammy,Rating 5 out of 5,"There are many who have read The Bell Jar and absolutely loved it. I am gladly considering myself one of them. I was a little caught of guard when I read a few reviews of The Bell Jar comparing it to The Catcher in the Rye stating how it's the female version of it. I liked Catcher but I know there are many people who didn't and upon hearing that may be similar to Catcher not have the desire to read it. I assure you, The Bell Jar is a book all on it's own and should not be compared to any other book... even as a compliment.When I first started reading the book I was a little put off, feeling it was an extremely pretensious novel. Her descriptions were crisp and precise, often using words that one rarely hears spoken or even read. I went into the novel knowing that Plath was a poet and felt that at first the book was just another form of her poetry and her showing off her writing abilities. But that only remained within the first two pages, because after that I became absorbed. The writing that I was a little sketchy about at first helped me visualize the setting and get to know the characters. And though Plath never really described many characters as to their personality, I began to feel I knew them all intimately.Strangely enough, if you remember in my last review, what bothered me most about The Good Earth did not bother me in The Bell Jar. Because the Esther, the character we are following, is slowly descending into madness, time no longer matters. There are a few times I was confused about the timeline, but it did not upset me. The book really spoke to me because of my own personal experiences with depression and suicide. It spoke to me as a woman and my views on sex and the confusion I'm sure most other girls out there face. It's amazing that this book was written and published over 30 years ago, really, when a new woman was coming out into the world. I have a feeling that this book helped women realize that they're not alone, and brought things to light that most people have commonly shoved aside; women and men. But what else is amazing is how relevant these topics still are today. Specifically with suicide, and specifically about the virtue and pureness of women compared to men.So I guess that is why The Bell Jar is often compared to The Catcher in the Rye, with it's discussions and writings of often controversial titles. Setting off a new generation of writers, styles, and people. Another book also came to mind as I was reading, and that was The Perks of Being a Wallflower. There are moments when I could make a few direct comparisons between the two. With Esther slowly seperating herself from socialization and sinking deeper into her own thoughts and depression. Analyzing things that go on around her and her surroundings. Very reminscent of Perks.If you feel you're suffering from depression, madness, confusion about topics pertaining to society and sex, or just looking for a good read, The Bell Jar is definetly the book for you. I also advise, if you're seriously suffering from depression, to get help for yourself. There is no shame in it, and getting help is better than ending your life. Even if you need to go on medication, DO NOT feel ashamed, especially if it's going to help you even more. "

(it has since been soundly defeated.) anyway, i didn't know classic fiction could be like this: written by a woman, fresh and relatable, about someone like me.that wasn't my experience upon reread.in the intervening years, i've read some of plath's poetry in other classes, and found it a little gaudy and self-indulgent for my taste. (you can yell at me if you want to but i don't think either of those are untrue. or even really insults.) so i always wondered if the bell jar would hold up if i read it again.the answer: no, but not for any reason i expected!this is racist and homophobic as f*ck. it's genuinely disturbing. this was written in the second half of the 20th century, in the midst of the civil rights movement. the march on washington took place in the same year as this book's publication. among legitimate intellectual and/or progressive circles of the time, this manner of thinking is grotesquely out of line. it seems especially absurd in the face of plath's dogged dedication to the Rights Of Women. feminism is important, of course, but reading about how the greatest social issue in plath's eyes (or the eyes of plath's self-insert protagonist) was women being able to be writers and editors with as much ease as they could be secretaries (as opposed to the several editors and writers there were) is kind of insane. obviously employment access is crucial, but the lack of self-awareness is apparent, no?this also has two of my least favorite clichéd traits of mental health depiction:1) a protagonist that blames everyone else for their mental illness, and2) Grand Gestures Of Depression.baby, i wish my mental illness included me doing things like whimsically throwing shirts at the city of new york while my hair blew in the wind. it's usually a lot more of me laying in bed and watching tiktoks.i guess that doesn't fit the seminal work criteria.in short: i love unlikable protagonists. it's just that i hated this one.bottom line: we all have an unpopular opinion, right? a beloved book we hate? let me have this one in peace.--------------------currently-reading updatesrereading this on the beach so i can be the edgiest girl there"
2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1198255-madeleine,Rating 4 out of 5,"I feel like I owe Sylvia Plath an apology. This is a book I actively avoided for years because so many people (namely female classmates who wanted to be perceived as painfully different or terminally misunderstood or on the verge of absolutely losing their teenage shit) lauded the virtues of this book and how it, like, so totally spoke to them in places they didn't even know they had ears. My own overly judgmental high-school self could not accept even the remote possibility of actual merit lurking between the covers of something that such bland, faux-distraught ninnies clung to like a life raft.I should probably also apologize for referring to every pair of oven mitts I've ever owned as a pair of Sylvias but I think the lady scribe in question was too mired in real problems to care all that much about my sick amusement's crass reduction.""The Bell Jar,"" packed as it was with bleak truths, difficult topics and wryly dark humor, was not at all what I was expecting. Old biases die hard: I couldn't help but brace myself for a trivial tribute to mental imbalances, White Girl Problems and petty complaints disguised as life-ruining moments. What I got was an utter lack of histrionics and a sincere, to-the-point road map of one talented young lady's fight against her inner demons. Sylvia's alter ego Esther Greenwood (let's all take a second to appreciate the sly cleverness of trading ""Sylvia"" for the fictional surname ""Greenwood"") is so straightforward in addressing her despair that I couldn't help but extend more sympathy than I thought I could muster to her understated suffering. If nothing else, this book taught me that my own bouts of the blues are simply me being human and could be so much more debilitating: For that clarity of self-awareness alone, I am grateful.Reading this as I neared the ""Infinite Jest"" finish line offered necessary perspective that helped me get a better idea of what it must have been like inside such a messy head. The relative ease with which IJ's depressed cast could self-medicate in secret or seek refuge where at least someone was trying to understand the extent of such gaping psychological wounds offered a jarring contrast to the way Sylvia/Esther seemed truly isolated from those who couldn't see how awful it was to live inside herself. While she encountered precious little understanding in both her personal life (Mrs. Greenwood's inability to see her daughter's problem as her daughter's problem instead of wondering what she did wrong just rubbed my modern sensibilities the wrong way) and from the medical professionals who were tasked with helping her rise above the sinking despair she couldn't escape, I finished this fictionalized semi-autobiography 50 years after its publication with a keener understanding of what Sylvia Plath endured than I'm comfortable with. "
3,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3839903-scarlet,Rating 4 out of 5,"There is this scene in Chapter 10 of The Bell Jar where Esther Greenwood decides to write a novel.
""My heroine would be myself, only in disguise. She would be called Elaine. Elaine. I counted the letters on my fingers. There were six letters in Esther, too. It seemed a lucky thing.""
I cannot help wondering, is that what Sylvia Plath thought when she wrote The Bell Jar? Did she, like Esther, sit on a breezeway in an old nightgown waiting for something to happen? Is that why she chose the name Esther? 6 letters - just like in Sylvia. For luck?It's impossible to read The Bell Jar and not be affected, knowing what happened to Plath. I mean, it's everywhere. She is everywhere. All of Esther's musings are Plath's own. It's eerie. There's hardly any comfort even when Esther is freed from the bell jar; on the contrary, it's a brutal reminder that this book is ultimately, part fiction.Plath's poetic prowess shows through her writing - especially the descriptions. They are so simple yet so fitting. There is one in particular I loved, where Esther compares her life to a fig tree (See the first status update). Here's another:
""I saw the years of my life spaced along a road in the form of telephone poles, threaded together by wires. I counted one, two, three...nineteen telephone poles, and then the wires dangled into space, and try as I would, I couldn’t see a single pole beyond the nineteenth.""
 The writing is remarkably unemotional and I don't mean that as a bad thing. Esther's (or Plath's?) commentary dwells entirely on thoughts and perceptions, never feelings. Depression is so often mistaken as a form of sadness. This woman, however, is not sad. She is empty. She is a shell. She contemplates killing herself with a kind of ease that's unnerving.The Bell Jar did not make me cry but I wish it did. What I'm left with now is a deep sense of unhappiness that I don't think tears can fix.Why is it that the most talented always fall prey to the bell jar? It's such a waste."

From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.”Phenomenal. Please read it. It's impeccable. Note: it definitely shows it's age with some racist descriptions of things which was a bummer and reminded me how lucky we are to live in 2020"

6,no user info,Rating 1 out of 5,"I've never shied away from depressing material, but there's a difference between the tone serving the story, and a relentlessly depressing work that goes entirely nowhere. I know it can be viewed as a glimpse into Plath's mind, but I would rather do a lot of things, some quite painful, than read this again. It hurt to get through it, and I think it's self-indulgent and serves no real artistic purpose. Which is truly a shame, as I love a lot of Plath's poetry. "
7,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-on-hiatus-but-getting-better-happy-new-2024,Rating 3 out of 5,"Review Are those with depression and cultural icons to be excused moral standards? I had a PM slagging me off completely about this review. Essentially it came down to how dare I criticise a feminist cultural icon who suffered from mental illness and accuse her of racism, anti-Semitism and homophobia. And if she really was why has no one else pointed it out? That I am biased as fuck etc. Actually others have pointed it out. That was the point of my review, separating the artist from their work. But now it is also, why are differing views not allowed? I realise that we are living in the times where belief and feelings are considered much more important than science and facts, where democratic voting is wrong and illegal if the 'wrong party' (US) or Brexit or Scottish Independence (UK) don't go the way that people want. And that any dissension results in deplatforming, cancelling or immense campaigns of hatred against academic and public figures. Is this the right way to go? No dissension, no debate, facts are wrong if they don't fit feelings, and cultural icons for one movement or another can do no wrong?__________How do we separate the artist from their art if we blithely don't notice it and then excuse them with saying it was a product of their times? It often wasn't. Dickens is excused his anti-Semitism but Disraeli was a two-time Prime Minister and was born Jewish. Oscar Wilde despite his poem in Reading Jail angry at being castigated for being a homosexual, still threw himself behind the anti-Dreyfusards who blamed Drefus for a murder he didn't commit but was blamed because he was Jewish. He was in the minority in the UK and lost his best friend over this. And then you have Roald Dahl, Agatha Christie, Ernest Hemingway, Jack London - the White supremacist who advocated genocide of the 'lesser races' but is a school favourite - and all the other racist, anti-Semitic often misogynist authors whose art is praised and characters white-washed ('white' washed indeed!)  With Plath, whose book The Bell Jar I read in my teens, when I read this article today, July 6th, 2022, it absolutely shocked me The Oxford Blue How could I not have noticed or forgotten? Am I so inured and hardened to White supremacist thinking - everyone else is 'other', and when I read I am reading as if was/am just white not 'other' Jews can be white or can be other, depends on the views of the writer, not me, that when reading a much-lauded 'great' author my eyes are blinded? *""[W]e cannot discuss Sylvia Plath without approaching the subject of her blatant racism and disrespect for Black people and Jewish people."" *""Her poems crassly compare her suffering to that of the Holocaust and beyond her fiction, Plath’s diaries dating back to her high school years show a history of hateful and disrespectful white supremacist thinking."" *""The viciousness of her comments about Jewish and Black people and the insensitive comparisons of her own struggles to those of the victims of the Holocaust show her to be completely out of touch with the era of progressive and civil rights activism"" in which she lived and obviously didn't agree with.As another article says, you cannot understand Plath if you don't understand her very Germanic upbringing by the German father she loved and whose death she was never able to get over. In her diary, in 1958, she wrote of her father, ""He … heiled Hitler in the privacy of his home.""Or maybe I didn't notice because I only read The Bell Jar and not Plath's poetry, I certainly would have picked it up from It stuck in a barb wire snare.ich, ich, ich, ich,I could hardly speakI thought every German was you. And the language obscene.An Engine, an engineChuffing me off like a jew.A jew to Dachau, Auschwitz, BelsenI began to talk like a jewI think I may well be a jew. I don't say I wouldn't read these authors or even enjoy their works - I love Oscar Wilde and certain Roald Dahl books - but I think knowing who an author was, the kind of views they held obviously informs their works, and that is important even if I decide to separate art from the artist."
8,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/117399210-lu-s,Rating 5 out of 5,"Extremely beautiful and powerfully poignant. The Bell Jar is the autobiographical story of a young girl with Esther's future (but shouldn't we say Sylvia?). The young winner of a literary talent competition discovers New York, its parties, demands, and futility.But at the same time, Esther becomes aware of her cruel maladjustment. Her personality cracks through twists and turns and lets us glimpse the drama on her return home. She is carried away by a furious melancholy, and her character crumbles. Unable to get up, she catches herself in the frightening whirlwind of the psychiatric world.A tour de force that this novel and one feels well behind Sylvia Plath's poetic soul renders with great accuracy the runaway of her thoughts, their confusions, and the loss of her momentum. It's very well written but accurate, and it is impressive how the language conveys Esther's mood and progression into madness. There are no big flights, no wrong notes; it's both testimony and almost a farewell letter."
9,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3675162-j-l-sutton,Rating 5 out of 5,"“To the person in the bell jar, blank and stopped as a dead baby, the world itself is a bad dream.”It had been a number of years since I last read Sylvia Plath’s The Bell Jar. What I’d remembered most was how well Plath had established the mood for this story by weaving the electrocutions of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg with the mental breakdown of her heroine, Esther Greenwood. But the story is definitely about Esther, her ambition, and her own feelings of inadequacy, even though (viewed from the outside) Esther would be seen as a success. What is amazing about this writing is its immersive quality; you feel Esther’s restrictive choices and alienation from her world because you ultimately realize the world she has been striving for was never in her grasp. The repeated questions (after she is being treated for her depression) about who will marry her now only reinforce the notion that for the intelligent and talented Esther Greenwood, there had never been a good way to extricate herself from a trap that she had always seen coming. Very compelling narrative!"
10,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/100759205-kat,No Rating,"When I was in high school, I was absolutely convinced that The Bell Jar was meant to be my favorite book of all time. The aesthetic of the ""sad girl"" ""female manipulator"" book appealed to me even then, before TikTok made it a trend. I never ended up actually reading it at the time, thanks to my old aversion to the classics, which I'm grateful for. I know that teen me would've taken all the wrong things about this story to heart, romanticized the fuck out of it, and I probably turned out 1000% more insufferable than I am right now (which is still plenty insufferable, don't worry. I mean, shit, I'm writing this and listening to Norman Fucking Rockwell at the same time. I'm a nuisance, as I was always meant to be).Anyway. Fast forward, I'm graduating from college in two short weeks and I figured that if there ever was a time to read this finally, now would be it. The Bell Jar is supposedly one of THE books for every girlie in her twenties, and time may have passed but I still have a giant soft spot for reading about women vs the void. So here we are.I don't think anything I have to say here that's going to come across as particularly outlandish. There's not really much I have to say at all, hence the three star. The writing is gorgeous, as I assumed it would be. Plath was obviously skilled with imagery and capable of creating poetry out of anything. I also found it incredibly interesting to read the book that came before so many of the ones I love now, and see what might've been used as inspiration. Lastly, I am glad I got to find all the famous quotes/scenes I've heard over the years within their context. Having the chance to underline ""I am I am I am"" in my dinky little paperback was satisfying, not gonna lie.Similarly, I don't have any criticisms with any real backing. All I know is I started to rapidly lose interest in the second half and felt nothing but disillusionment by the end. Maybe that's the intended effect. Maybe if I were to analyze this like its homework I'd be able to come up with something other than 'I neither liked nor disliked it' as my final thought. But unfortunately, I read it for funsies, that was the first thing that shot through my head when I shut the book, and so far nothing else has followed.I can appreciate this novel as a piece of good writing and an important part of sad bitch history, but if not for the fact that it is an established piece of literature I really wouldn't be giving it a second thought--or a review, for that matter."
11,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12851291-karen,Rating 4 out of 5,"My dad went mad in the early seventies when my mom filed for divorce and took up with another man after 12 yrs of marriage. He ended up in a place called Glenn Eden here in Michigan and went through a dozen or more electric shock treatments, I remember visiting him through a window from outside the place. He eventually recovered and remarried, led a normal life, but this book was kind of frightening to me, remembering that time, the atmosphere of such a place, and the stigma of mental illness.I myself suffer and am on meds, but never have I felt suicidal, I just don’t understand that frame of mind. Esther (Sylvia), I identified with her on some of her feelings, she was quite humorous, and I am sure that in the 50’s, it was very hard to live with such terrible depression. The writing was so good, I was feeling her. Hard to read knowing what eventually happened to her, but I’m glad I finally did read it. I’m sure many of us at times feel we are stuck under the bell jar."
12,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38914917-eya,Rating 1 out of 5,"This is, by far, the most disappointed I’ve ever been when it came to a book.Not just with the book itself, but with how many people decided to ignore the racism taking place in it.I’ve had this novel praised to me so many times that I idolized it for years before I even bought it. I was so scared that I wouldn’t like it that I kept waiting to be in “the right mind-set” before I decided to finally pick it up.About a quarter into the book I had already encountered not one, but 3 racist comments made by Esther (the main character). And I was so surprised that no one ever mentioned this to me that I had to stop reading, go on goodreads and look at the reviews to see if anyone was addressing it, and nothing.So I told myself I was reading too much into it and kept on reading, and by the 4th comment I was starting to lose it.So I went online and looked it up, and the only thing that turned up was a personal blog and a goodreads thread that mostly blamed the racism on “the time the novel was written in”, to which I would just like to say, and pardon my french, that’s complete and utter bullshit.This book was written in the 60s! The NINETEEN-60s!! in. the. middle. of. the. civil. rights. movement.And I’m not saying racism didn’t exist back then, hell, that’s what the whole movement was about. And I get that people weren’t “woke”, and that using certain slang was normal back then, BUT I could name at least a dozen writers who didn’t feel the need to be racist while writing from (what we all know is) their personal pov. Hell, I could name novels published in the 19th fucking century that advocated against racism. Sylvia could’ve at least picked up ONE of those during her lifetime, jfc.I’m not just speaking about the 5+ times she used the n word, it’s not my place to say whether that was wrong or not. I’m talking about the explicit racist comments (against more races than one, if I may add) that made me want to drench this book in gasoline, light it on fire then flush it down the fucking toilet: •	In one part, Esther Greenwood describes her reflection as ""a big, smudgy-eyed Chinese woman staring idiotically into my face,""  •	In another she says: “the face in the mirror looks like a sick Indian"" •	At one point she calls indigenous Mexicans ugly and says things like ""dusky as a bleached-blonde negress"" •	In a scene where Esther is being served dinner while in the mental health institute. The man serving her is described as a stupid, laughing, indolent Black man with huge, rolling eyes, a racist trope made popular with books like ""The Story of Little Black Sambo,"" which was published in 1898. During this scene, the man commits the “offense” of serving two types of beans for dinner, and Esther punishes him for it by kicking him.  •	When Esther’s friend is telling her about a guy she’s interested in, who happens to be from Peru, Esther replies with: “they're squat…they're ugly as Aztecs.""All of that being said, I think I should mention that: a/ the writing was actually pretty decent  b/ I am not going to ignore the awareness it brought around mental health for so many years. But, if that’s the only reason you’re reading this, then I suggest you check out Girl, Interrupted instead, it’s equally as representative (if not more/better) of mental health, based on Susanna Kaysen’s real life (it’s more of a memoir-ish type), it includes plenty of documents and notes from her time in a mental health institute, and, most importantly, it isn’t problematic."

Coinvolgerla tanto da affermare che ‘La campana di vetro’ era an autobiographical apprentice work which I had to write in order to free myself from the pastCoinvolgerla tanto da ricorrere a uno pseudonimo, il nom de plume di Victoria Lucas, tanto era forte l’autobiografismo di queste pagine: al punto che la madre ne ostacolò la pubblicazione negli States riuscendo a postporla fino al 1971. Si liberò così bene del passato che tre settimane dopo l’uscita del romanzo nelle librerie, Sylvia preparò pane e burro e due tazze di latte che lasciò al sicuro sul comodino per i figli, sigillò porte e finestre, infilò la testa nel forno a gas e riuscì laddove Esther, l’io narrante di queste pagine, aveva fallito.Continuando a sentirsi sul lato sbagliato della vita, come Holden al quale questo romanzo è così spesso accostato, Lady Lazarus portò a termine il suo suicidio, gesto già tentato in pratica, e dettagliatamente esaminato in tutte le sue svariate possibilità in queste stesse illuminanti pagine.Silvia Plath è stata prima di tutto e soprattutto dedita alla poesia: è con quest’arte che è rimasta nella storia. Questo è il suo unico romanzo, l’unica opera in prosa (diari a parte). Foto MD’O.Eppure, La campana di vetro è scritto dimenticando la poesia, senza cercare lirismo, con uno stile diretto irriverente spiazzante, e agghiacciante, intriso d’ironia fino al black humour, che mi ha particolarmente colpito per come sembra volare basso e per come non cambia registro nonostante la storia si trasformi e passi dalle esperienze e avventure di una giovane studentessa a una caduta nel baratro della depressione (o quello che era – a me sembra che la depressione è un’etichetta che si appiccica un po’ ovunque - da un po’ di tempo lo si fa anche col bipolarismo). Continuando a scrivere nello stesso modo, dissacrante e non convenzionale, Plath divide la sua storia in tre fasi piuttosto ben distinte, che racconta in perfetta unità di stile pur passando dalla pazzia del mondo al mondo della pazzia. Il risultato è ben più che notevole, è il primo regalo di questo romanzo molto molto bello.Tre fasi: la prima è ambientata a New York nell’estate del 1953.La ""campana di vetro"" è resa ancora più manifesta, percepibile, quasi visibile, dall’afa estiva che avvolge la città. Esther, non ancora ventenne, sta facendo uno stage presso una rivista femminile. Alloggia in un albergo insieme ad altre ragazze, cerca insistentemente di liberarsi della sua verginità, vissuta come parte dell’oppressione, fa vita modaiola, aspetta di essere ammessa a un corso di scrittura creativa, sta vivendo il suo rito iniziatico, accumula incontri ed esperienze, ma più di tutto accumula scollamento.Infatti, ciò che dovrebbe essere non corrisponde a ciò che sente: e quando scopre di non essere stata ammessa, si libera di tutti i suoi vestiti in una magnifica scena dal forte sapore simbolico, e inizia la sua caduta, comincia a disgregarsi (la “smarginatura” di Elena Ferrante).Qui inizia la seconda fase, col ritorno a casa, a Boston, percepita come luogo molto provinciale, nella casa di famiglia, a stretto contatto con la mamma, e si sa che l’amore è responsabile di molti misfatti – in questo caso, è certo che la presenza materna, il suo modo di voler bene alla figlia, la completa integrazione dell’adulta alle regole imposte dalla società, offrono a Esther una buona spinta verso un tentativo di suicidio e quello che poi succede nella terza fase. Il momento saliente, prima ancora del tentato suicidio, si manifesta quando Esther si accorge che la sua grafia è diventata illeggibile, storta e distorta come la sua mente e il suo modo di guardare la realtà delle cose.La terza fase è dedicata alla cura e alla faticosa risalita verso la ""normalità"". Da una clinica all’altra, da un intervento medico all’altro, Esther sembra farcela, mentre invece Sylvia, che conosce il male di scrivere e quello di vivere, non ce la farà.Esther non vuole sottostare alle regole, si sente un pesce fuor d’acqua (in questo, certo, ricorda Holden), continua a ribellarsi alle scelte rigide e definitive (vedi il matrimonio, il promesso sposo) che le vengono imposte dall’ambiente. Esther vorrebbe poter provare tutto, non essere ingabbiata, e Plath sceglie un’immagine molto bella per esemplificare: l’albero di fichi, dove ogni frutto rappresenta una vita diversa, e il desiderio di avere tutti i frutti paralizza Esther fino a che i fichi marciscono e cadono per terra.Più che brividi, dà la scossa leggere degli elettroshock ai quali viene sottoposta la protagonista, sia nella forma massiccia che in quella più blanda (omeopatica?). E non si può non cogliere l’agghiacciante parallelo con la vicenda dei Rosenberg giustiziati sulla sedia elettrica (riguarderò il film di Lumet).Sembra riduttiva una lettura femminista di quest’opera, che trascende l’identificazione con la sola sfera femminile, come non è solo l'America spietata, borghese e maccartista degli anni Cinquanta ad apparire spaventosa, ma gli schemi sociali in genere: la campana di vetro che schiaccia la protagonista sotto il peso della sua protezione, togliendole l'aria, stritolandola nell’ingranaggio di una normalità che ignora la poesia, non riguarda solo Esther.Così come, nonostante qualche analogia, a me sembra forzato il paragone con Holden, capolavoro a se stante che troppo spesso viene tirato (ma soprattutto stiracchiato) in ballo: in questo caso non c’è neppure l’adolescenza in comune, Esther per quanto frettolosa di liberarsi della sua (tardiva?) verginità, è più grande di Holden, e si sa a quell’età della vita tre anni sono una differenza di secoli. Non basta l’impossibilità di ricomporre un ‘io diviso’ per giocare nella stessa squadra. Anche se non è difficile capire che per le lettrici Esther possa aver significato quello che Holden ha significato per i lettori.I am only thirtyAnd like the cat I have nine times to die.This is Number Three."

The Bell Jar tells us the story of Esther Greenwood, a woman from Boston who comes to live in New York City. Sylvia Plath wrote this novel under the pseudonym Victor Lucas. The author passed away one month after this book was published. The public was eager to find the similarities between Esther Greenwood and Ms. Plath at that time. Esther's depression and mental breakdown, electroconvulsive therapy, and suicide attempt are all shrewdly depicted by the author. There are multiple instances where the author sharply criticizes the patriarchal society in America at that time. The search for feminine independence is portrayed brilliantly with the help of the extraordinary narrative style. This is one of the best semi-autobiographical novels that I have read.

Perhaps the genre should be called autobiographical fiction (is that already a thing?). Because of this, I was very glad that the book included a short biography of Plath at the end to compare her life experiences and her experiences with writing it to the final product. While now it might only seem somewhat shocking and controversial, at the time I am sure it was a book that people may have had to sneak so that others did not realize they were reading it.The first half focused a lot on the main character’s (Esther, and therefore Plath’s) experience with the questionable behavior of men in her life. I believe what she deals with is what would now be called “toxic masculinity”. The men she meets just treat her so very wrong and they don’t even realize it. It’s as if she is not even a person, just a personality-less flesh puppet to ply with drinks and “mansplain” things to. For those who watch the show Mad Men, I was reminded of the characters Peggy and Joan in the first few seasons who are trying to breakthrough to do the work the men do but are often talked down to as they are expected to be secretaries and housewives. I imagine if a traditional “manly man” in the 60s found his wife reading this he would have likely done something drastically inappropriate to her and thought nothing of it.The second half of the book deals with depression, mental decay, and suicide. I felt so bad for Esther. She had issues, she needed help, and the help she received was so wildly inappropriate, it was infuriating. I was reminded of stories and movies from and set in that time period (Rosemary Kennedy and Angelina Jolie’s character in the Movie Changeling to name a couple) where the answer to a woman experiencing mental struggles in the 50s and 60s might be to nonchalantly toss them into a sanatorium or have them lobotomized. Men who had the same issues were not treated the same, even some that were truly mentally disturbed, while a woman battling with what might have only been mild depression or manic behavior might find themselves locked away and receiving shock treatment. If this part of the book doesn’t get you riled up, I would be surprised!It should be very telling that Plath originally released this under a pseudonym because she was afraid of the response she would receive. If you have to hide reality behind a fake name and fictionalization, then I think that proves there is something very wrong with reality.The Bell Jar is a must read. Some of the content may be hard to swallow, but it is a very powerful statement that will help humanity learn from its mistakes and avoid repeating them."

He dragged out a table on wheels with a machine on it and rolled it behind the head of the bed. The nurse started swabbing my temples with a smelly grease. As she leaned over to reach the side of my head nearest the wall, her fat breast muffled my face like a cloud or a pillow. A vague, medicinal stench emanated from her flesh.‘Don’t worry,’ the nurse grinned down at me. ‘Their first time everybody’s scared to death.’ I tried to smile but my skin had gone stiff, like parchment…Dr. Gordon was fitting two metal plates on either side of my head. He buckled them into place with a strap that dented my forehead, and gave me a wire to bite. I shut my eyes. There was a brief silence, like an indrawn breath. Then something bent down and took hold of me and shook me like the end of the world. Whee-ee-ee-ee, it shrilled, through an air crackling with blue light, and with each flash a great jolt drubbed me till I thought my bones would break and the sap fly out of me like a split plant. I wondered what terrible thing it was that I had done…”-	Sylvia Plath, The Bell JarIn the early morning hours of February 11, 1963, Sylvia Plath sealed her children’s room with masking tape, turned on the gas, and stuck her head in an oven. She was thirty years old. This is a rather grim way to start a discussion of The Bell Jar, but utterly necessary, because Plath’s death haunts every page of this wonderfully-realized story of a woman descending into insanity. This is one of those instances where fiction and fact are so tightly interwoven that they cannot really be separated. That is, part of the power of The Bell Jar comes from the palpable presence of Plath’s ghost. Reality casts a funereal pall over the proceedings, yet The Bell Jar opens jauntily enough. “It was a queer, sultry summer,” first-person narrator Esther Greenwood announces in the novel’s arresting first line, “the summer they electrocuted the Rosenbergs.” Esther, we soon learn, is in New York City, with a prestigious internship at a fashion magazine. There is a certain breeziness in the early going, so that it is not hard to conjure up an image from, say, The Devil Wears Prada: a tale of a young woman on the make, in the city that never sleeps. As we move forward, however, Esther – who proves an endearing, self-deprecating narrator – struggles with the glitz and glam that others so eagerly seek. Her time in New York is not seamless, and several incidents, ranging from the amusing (there are some surprisingly funny moments) to the terrifying, starts to degrade Esther’s mental condition. It does not give too much away to say that The Bell Jar is about Esther’s declining mental health. The strength of The Bell Jar, though, is partially derived from the fact that Esther, narrating in the first-person, never comes out and says, “then I went crazy.” Instead, Plath – through Esther – provides a precise, detailed, chilling presentation of Esther’s loss of sanity by describing everything with matter-of-factness. Her psychotic “breaks” are not identified as such. Rather, Esther depicts both the real and the unreal in the exact same manner, so that there is a blurring between the two. Years ago, as a young defense attorney, I worked the mental health beat, representing indigent clients contesting their civil commitments. Quite unexpectedly, I found it one of the more fascinating and rewarding things I’ve ever done. It was a job you could never plan for, and which could be funny, heartbreaking, and terrifying, all in the space of a few rapidly oscillating minutes in a confined space. That period gave me a profound awe for the human brain. You are always told how remarkable is the mind, but sometimes you need to see something in relief to see it at all. Thus, in observing the functioning of “non-normal” brain chemistry, I saw the power firsthand. I met with people whose view of the universe was completely at odds with the reality I perceived, and yet they could hold onto this alternate-reality for years, spinning these amazing webs from which they could not break (and of which I sometimes became a part). For these people, it was impossible to detach delusion from non-delusion. The former became as strong as the latter, until the two became the identical sides of the same coin. That’s what makes the mid-section of The Bell Jar so compelling. It contains Esther's scrupulously-detailed breakdown: a succession of doctors; a mother who doesn't understand and wants her to snap out of it; life in an asylum; electro-shock therapy; insulin therapy; and a black nurse’s aide who feeds her two types of beans, which is the kind of detail that had me nodding my head in recognition. (So much of great fiction is in small, perfect details). Beyond that, Plath’s Esther is blisteringly honest, and not just about matters of mental health. For instance, there is a scene where Esther loses her virginity that is told with a candor that is surprising today, not to mention the date when it was first published. As to publication, The Bell Jar became available in Britain – under a pseudonym – in 1963. Just a few months later, Plath took her own life, simultaneously cutting short a promising career, while launching a certain mythos. The novel did not arrive in America for several more years. When it did, it became an instant bestseller, and eventually, a classic. However, like John Kennedy Toole’s A Confederacy of Dunces, it is a strange classic, inextricably bound up in the death of its creator. Regardless of its baggage, The Bell Jar could stand on its own. It is poignant, honest, unflinching. The prose is beautiful, touched with poetry. The ending is unforgettable. But it would be wrong to separate The Bell Jar from its baggage, because the novel and its context inform each other. There is a certain level of sadness here that simply cannot be escaped. Yet Plath imbues The Bell Jar with glints and glimmers of hope. There is a brief reference to Esther’s future, a future free of hospitals and distortions and demons. It is clear that Esther – and by extension Plath – had some optimism for what lay ahead. We know, of course, that Plath never reached that better day, but we can wish, even believe, that somehow Esther did."
18,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17295672-jaidee,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5 ""descriptive rather than insightful"" stars !! I told my GR friend Ann that I meant to read this since age 16. All the girls I had crushes on at the time were reading this book with their pencil skirts and Smiths Tshirts. I read some Plath poetry that I enjoyed but never got to this novel. I spent a good deal of time reflecting on Esther...the heroine in this modern classic. She is a fascinating study in female narcissism that mistakes herself for being misunderstood, special and superior to men, lesbians and those of other social classes and ethnicities. She is raised by a working class widowed mother whom Esther feels a great deal of disdain and hostility towards. Esther, however, continually struggles for her independence, dealing with her suppressed libido and I suspect significant lesbian tendencies of her own. None of this is unusual in late adolescent females who consider themselves both world weary and special. Unfortunately Esther suffers also from unprocessed grief, school disappointments and a traumatic event that bring out her biological vulnerability,in her case, either very severe depressive psychosis or more likely a schizoaffective disorder that render her non-functional, at times delusional and severely suicidal.  This book is her journey from confused spoiled brat to a young woman with a horrendous mental illness and her journey back to the living world. The book is very adept at describing the moral and the social roles of white middle class Northeastern men and women as well as the hypocrisies of that time period. At times the book is hilariously funny despite being about a young woman's immense psychic suffering. This book did not reach four star status however. I found much of it fragmented, unfinished and the prose (unlike her poetry) rather pedestrian more than inspired. I also found that although I found the character most fascinating I was not able to empathize or understand to the degree that I had hoped for. "

I think we ought to read only the kind of books that wound and stab us. If the book we are reading doesn't wake us up with a blow on the head, what are we reading it for? ...we need the books that affect us like a disaster, that grieve us deeply, like the death of someone we loved more than ourselves, like being banished into forests far from everyone, like a suicide. A book must be the axe for the frozen sea inside us.— Franz Kafka; January 27, 1904I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor… and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was... (Chapter 7)There is a lulling silence engulfing this entire book, and if it weren’t for the darkening clouds approaching, an infinite palette brimming with all the shades of creation, one may never guess that it is the calm before the storm. Amid the impending commotion, the ancient state of confusion hovering over this land, a tree has already started to sense the chaos. A fig tree is losing its branches, one by one, as the storm unleashes its fury and time passes us by. The house does no longer provides shelter; its white walls won’t stop the cold, we see the ceiling yet we’ll feel the rain. Crystals are besieging us. The captives in the world of glass feel it all.

My first encounter with Sylvia Plath’s work was Ariel. It was a good read but it didn’t leave me memorable impressions. Later I understood how excruciatingly personal her poetry was, thus missing a plethora of subtle vocals, strong undertones, harrowing melodies. After reading about her life and watching a biopic, the connection was absolutely different regarding, for instance, the same two poems I had read months ago. There may be a lack of lyrical substance, of the mellifluous quality in language worthy of all praises, but to me, the beauty of her verse lies on her honest display of emotions through complex and raw imagery. I find that openness refreshing. How unsafe it is to be on the brink of vulnerability, with a bunch of emotions for one person or a whole world to see. And yet, how brave; giving free expression to such feelings, turning them into creative energy. How invigorating. Even when no one is listening to anyone. Not even the ones who complain about how deaf the world is. Under these circumstances, I decided to revisit her poetry someday. The thing that triggered this series of fortunate events was a review by a friend, which made me want to give Plath’s writing another try, because I had sensed many times that she was an author I would certainly love – inexplicable hunches. Therefore, I dived into her only novel, The Bell Jar, first published in 1963 under the pseudonym “Victoria Lucas” and under her name in 1967. It tells the story of Esther Greenwood, the young heiress of several of Plath’s life experiences. 
The trouble was, I had been inadequate all along, I simply hadn't thought about it.
I dreaded this review; I knew that from this novel would emerge a personal journal barely touching upon the merits of the book. I postponed the process many times since I didn’t want to deal with it, the easiest path evoking an infantile self-preservation, considering the world as an enormous rug where one can hide every unpleasant feeling, all the mirrors whose reflections we don’t dare to acknowledge.
I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn’t make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.
In this novel, I found indecision under the apposite metaphor of a fig tree; undying portions of time where absence is a unilateral reality, and the inability to fit the standards to which a woman is supposed to belong – a perpetual rift between professional development and motherhood. The disparities between the world of a man and the encapsulated universe of a woman in mid-20th-century America. Or any place, any time.
I couldn’t stand the idea of a woman having to have a single pure life and a man being able to have a double life, one pure and one not.
Such differences constitute a theme that is deeply explored in this book, and from all perspectives, such as work and sexuality.
Whether she knew it or not, Philomena Guinea was buying my freedom. “What I hate is the thought of being under a man’s thumb,” I had told Doctor Nolan. “A man doesn’t have a worry in the world, while I’ve got a baby hanging over my head like a big stick, to keep me in line.”
While fighting against her demons, we find in Esther a powerful and perceptive character, full of conviction and harboring a strong yearning for independence, a situation that naturally didn’t involve the oppressive presence of a man absorbing her individuality like an unwavering sponge. However, the way her mind worked was much more profound than a trendy dislike composed of empty words. It was a search for identity in a society ruled by men and in which she felt inadequate most of the time. Through the character’s reflections, we witness her longing for liberation from the ties of the expected.
The trouble was, I hated the idea of serving men in any way. I wanted to dictate my own thrilling letters.
It is certainly striking that this novel, which deals with complex themes under such a stifling atmosphere, could also make me smile. Esther has a unique sense of humor and some of her comments regarding a vast array of things were rather amusing. Under the night that never seemed to end, trying to illuminate the long corridors of her mind, accompanied by voices, electricity and despair, she made me her confident and brought me smiles to pass the time.The Bell Jar is an ambitious work, as I read before, but it’s not a perfect novel. There are some fissures that should prevent me from giving it a 5-star rating. Nevertheless, I changed my first rating from four to five stars; it is on my “favorites” shelf, another favorite axe, and it has rekindled my feelings for Plath. I am grateful for the story she shared. And for the fate she forged for her character. 
I took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart. I am, I am, I am.
 Despite the darkness in which this book is immersed, a sense of hope still lingers even after finishing this somber journey. Fig trees are on solid ground, awaiting for courage, a leap of faith, life-changing decisions – meaning, beauty, uniqueness. The silence, a limpid layer which allows to admire the now splendid azure sky, is no longer an ominous sign. As a small stone is thrown into a pond, causing violent ripples that soon vanish while the former serenity is restored, such silence is interrupted briefly by the sound of glass breaking. In the midst of too much consciousness, those small shivers are a vital part of the 
ritual for being born twice—patched, retreaded and approved for the road.

From the very beginning, even before her breakdown, I found very little to care for or associate with about Esther. She seemed cynical, disdainful, self-important, and manipulative. I just flat out didn’t like her. So when she really began to have some trouble mentally (actually, even before that) I, as a reader, wanted to close the book and get away from her rather than keep reading and see her through it. When I did finish the book, it felt more like a relief than an accomplishment. This is not a story I ever want to revisit. There is much talk of suicide in The Bell Jar and it vividly describes what it can be like to experience a descent into depression. I admire it for what it is but it's just not my cup of tea. It left me feeling gloomy and unsettled. In the same vein, I would recommend Girl, Interrupted by Susanna Kaysen. I felt more involved with that one and felt like I learned a good bit about the subject matter."

Originally published under the pseudonym ""Victoria Lucas"" in 1963, the novel is semi-autobiographical, with the names of places and people changed. The book is often regarded as a roman a clef since the protagonist's descent into mental illness parallels Plath's own experiences with what may have been clinical depression or bipolar II disorder. Plath died by suicide a month after its first UK publication. The novel was published under Plath's name for the first time in 1967 and was not published in the United States until 1971, in accordance with the wishes of both Plath's husband, Ted Hughes, and her mother. The novel has been translated into nearly a dozen languages. The novel, though dark, is often read in high school English classes.عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «حباب شیشه»؛ «شیشه»؛ نویسنده: سیلویا پلات (نشر باغ)؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز سوم ماه سپتامبر سال 2006میلادیعنوان: شیشه؛ عنوان دیگر حباب شیشه؛ نویسنده: سیلویا پلات (پلت)؛ مترجم: گلی امامی؛ تهران، نیل، 1352؛ در 229ص؛ چاپ دیگر تهران، نقش و نگار، سال 1381؛ در 230ص؛ شابک 9646235581؛ با عنوان: حباب شیشه؛ تهران، باغ نو، 1384؛ در 225ص؛ شابک 9647425295؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده امریکا - سده 20مداستان دختری به نام «استر گرینوود» شیفته‌ ی پسری به نام «بادی» می‌شود؛ با گذشت زمان «استر» درمی‌یابد که او هیچ شباهتی به همسر ایده‌ آل او ندارد و ناگزیر از او جدا می‌شود؛ در این هنگام، «استر» به بیماری روانی دچار و دست به خودکشی می‌زند، حال آن که مادرش او را از مرگ نجات می‌دهد و «استر» در آسایشگاه روانی بستری می‌گردد و.....؛ «حباب شیشه» رمان شبه‌ زندگی‌نامه‌ ای اثر «سیلویا پلات» شاعر «آمریکایی» است، که در سال 1963میلادی منتشر شد، و تنها رمان ایشان به شمار می‌رود؛ «سیلویا پلات» این اثر را با نام مستعار «ویکتوریا لوکاس» منتشر، و یک ماه پس از آن خودکشی کردند؛ «حباب شیشه» شباهت بسیاری با زندگی واقعی «سیلویا پلات» دارد، و چنین به نظر می‌رسد که تنها اسامی شخصیت‌ها و مکان‌ها تغییر کرده‌ اند؛ «سیلویا پلات» در این شاهکار تحسین شده و جاودان، با چنان ظرافتی خوانشگر را به دنیای ذهنی در حال نابودی «استر» میبرد، که جنون و دیوانگی این شخصیت، کاملا ملموس و حتی منطقی و عقلانی جلوه میکند؛ رمان «حباب شیشه»، کاوشی ژرف، در تاریکترین و مخوفترین گوشه و کنارهای ذهن بشر است، و پیروزی شگرف و اثر کلاسیکی جاودان به شمار میآید، اثر به زبان‌های بسیاری ترجمه شده و با وجود درونمایه ی تیره‌ اش در دبیرستان‌های کشورهای انگلیسی‌ زبان به عنوان متن درسی استفاده می‌شود...؛از سیلویا پلات پنج دفتر شعر برجای مانده است: «بچه غول (1960میلادی)»؛ «کلوسوس و اشعار دیگر (1962میلادی)»؛ «آریل (1965میلادی)»؛ «گذر از آب (1971میلادی)»؛ «درختان زمستانی (1972میلادی)»؛ «مجموعه اشعار (1981میلادی)»؛ تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 07/08/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 16/06/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"

There are no promises to keep and no expectations to be fulfilled except a small desire survives somewhere, a desire wishing for wings of freedom to gather their strength again to soar high in the sky and letting the old brag of heart to leap out and declare in a booming voice – I am, I am, I am.Another book, another writer and another winner. I simply loved The Bell Jar. I approached it weighing under the burden of my hollow prejudices and expected a story that won’t surprise me in any remarkable way but Sylvia Plath! She gave me a valuable gift in the form of this book. I’ll probably come across as heavily drenched in my emotions here but it’s not every day one finds something which perfectly vocalizes the suppressed whispers of one’s past and an immediate present. Another case of deep connection? Not exactly. Just the right amount of shared feelings and a long awaited consolation that I’m not the only one. 
 I felt dreadfully inadequate. The trouble was, I had been inadequate all along, I simply hadn't thought about it... I felt like a racehorse in a world without racetracks or a champion college footballer suddenly confronted by Wall Street and a business suit, his days of glory shrunk to a little gold cup on his mantel with a date engraved on it like the date on a tombstone. 
 No self-pity or depressing delusions, just plain simple confession which born out of the realization after an official entry into the real world. The Bell Jar is about Esther Greenwood but I would like to view that name as some sort of anagram which encompasses everyone of us within it, maybe not in its entirety but in bits and parts. In all likelihood, nothing is there in a name and surely I can’t speak for everyone else but I know that there’s something in the writing style of Sylvia which holds the power of drawing readers in her tale and no matter how much one tries to break free from her words (because they hurt!) it’s almost impossible to do so. Esther made me laugh with her honest descriptions of the world and the people around her. She made me her accomplice in her jokes and in her secrets and she made me empathized with her and her plights but at the same time, I was grateful that she was able to share her pain without appearing miserable or demanding any form of solace. She is. She is. She is. That’s how I cheered for her.I uttered 'nothing new’ many times while reading it but considering it as a book written 50 years ago which still resonated at such an inexplicable level with me is fascinating to think of. Should I mourn at the repeated instances of histories which repeat themselves or cheer about the knowledge that there lived a girl who had a talent of telling something on behalf of most of us? I’m still contemplating about those questions but I guess they’ll lose their significance in time to come and only magical essence of Sylvia’s words shall remain with me. Piece by piece, I fed my wardrobe to the night wind, and flutteringly, like a loved one's ashes, the gray scraps were ferried off, to settle here, there, exactly where I would never know, in the dark heart of New York."

”It was a queer, sultry summer, the summer they electrocuted the Rosenbergs, and I didn't know what I was doing in New York.”
When Esther Greenwood wins an internship at a New York fashion magazine in 1953, she is elated, believing she will finally realise her dream to become a writer. But in between the cocktail parties and piles of manuscripts, Esther's life begins to slide out of control. She finds herself spiralling into depression and eventually a suicide attempt, as she grapples with difficult relationships and a society which refuses to take women's aspirations seriously.Where do I even begin to review this magnificent book. I feel it has come to me at a point in my life that I needed it most. We follow the life of young Esther who at a certain point in the narrative ends up going into a deep depression and is admitted to a psychiatric clinic. Plath herself had attempted suicide in 1952. It is because of this combination of autobiographical references, the topic of depression and the author's ability and sensitivity to express what she was going through that make this one of the most beautiful, complex, sensitive, deep, dense books, sad and hard to read. Esther Greenwood, our fictional protagonist, is unfortunately only a veiled cover for Plath’s real world disease which reached its nadir in 1963 when she took her own life at the young age of thirty. Plath’s prose is incredibly beautiful. If you did not already know, you can tell with ease that this writing is very personal. As much as it was meant to be shared, it also seems like a form of release. Plath deals with the anxieties of adulthood, the female psyche, and the grotesque reality of psychiatric treatments against a 50s backdrop. Themes like this are heavy. They linger. This is what makes The Bell Jar such a success. This is how the book manages to find a place between our hands, hearts, and heads.What it has to say about what women expect of themselves, and what society expects of women, is as sharply relevant today as it has always been.It's not a book for everyone, it's not for anytime, but at the same time it's a book for everyone and for life.
”To the person in the bell jar, blank and stopped as a dead baby, the world itself is a bad dream.”

O bien ella no ha logrado transmitirme el horror de ese fondo del hoyo que es una depresión o yo no he sido capaz de concebir la profunda desesperación que, pienso, debe sentir la protagonista dentro de esa campana que la envuelve y que le impide relacionarse y encontrar su sitio en ese mundo de hombres en el que la mujer sigue sujeta a roles y comportamientos establecidos por ellos. En realidad, no sé si hay que buscar razones, no sé hasta qué punto la depresión es consecuencia de las circunstancias que rodean al sujeto o solo bastan las circunstancias internas. Lo que sí sé es que esa enfermedad determina completamente la relación que el individuo establece con esas circunstancias. Y esto es lo que más me ha gustado de la novela, la forma tan honesta -se supone que es autobiográfica- en la que describe sus relaciones con las amigas, con los hombres, cercanos o desconocidos, con su madre y, por encima de todo, consigo misma, su insatisfacción personal, su bajísima autoestima, su ansiedad por abarcarlo todo o, al menos, abarcar en su totalidad algo importante. Si hubiera que buscar una de esas razones, que quizás no sean suficientes para explicar nada, estarían perfectamente descritas y resumidas en una de las famosas citas de la autora:
 ""Quizás cuando sintamos que queremos tenerlo todo, será porque estamos en peligro de estar cerca de no querer nada.""

27,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32804270-michael,Rating 4 out of 5,"Based on Plath's own experience of breakdown in college, The Bell Jar charts the deterioration of protagonist Esther Greenwood's mental stability while interning for a fast-paced fashion magazine one summer in New York City. The first-person retrospective narration juxtaposes ironic detachment and impassioned lyricism: Esther swings from cooly assessing the insurmountable adversity she faces as a woman living in a sexist society to recounting the fits of existential despair she suffered the year she lost control over her life. The narrative is tightly structured, the descriptions moving, the characterization nuanced. Considering that the novel is a first-rate work of art with an ambiguous ending, it seems important to approach The Bell Jar on its own terms with detailed attention to its history and form, not its author's act of suicide. Autobiographical as the story is, the book's much more than an unself-aware reflection of Plath's life or an ominous foreshadowing of her death. To overlook the work's artifice or its fictionality not only does a disservice to Plath as an artist but also perpetuates the reductive views about the work of women (writers) that in part prompted Plath to write the novel in the first place."

Her thoughts turn dark and helplessness envelopes her in a tight, downward spiral. Plath captures the emotional characterization of depression and the utter helplessness that accompanies it.

30,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9889835-matthias,Rating 3 out of 5,"I'm really struggling with writing a review for this one, given the unique nature of the book and the sad reality that surrounds it. Every book is a testament of its author in one way or another, but with this semi-fictional autobiography it's difficult not to equate the book with its tragic author, making the reviewing of it an exercise in the kind of delicacy I'm not very well versed in. A delicacy that, frankly, I don't really enjoy employing. So what is one to do when he didn't really like ""The Bell Jar""? Tread very carefully through the thorny bushes, knowing many in the Goodreads populace have a special place in their heart for this sensitive book. I decided on a respectful three-star rating even though my less delicate self would probably give it only two. It gets three because of its importance, because of its needing to be heard, but my heart of hearts doesn't care all that much about importance. It cares about being lifted up while this story mainly seemed to try and drag it down. I called this book an ""autobiography"", but with the important difference that autobiographies put the emphasis on a life fully lived, while in this book life seems pretty empty and the story was mostly about reasons for and ways of ending it. This book reads very much like a cry for help, and cries for help don't generally make for pleasant reading. The fact I felt useless as I heard that cry, the dread that comes with seeing a person consumed by fires I can't put out and other such merry sentiments make it hard for me to say I enjoyed this book. Everybody who reads this classic also knows about the tragic fate of the author, making the cry for help all the more chilling and making it akin to the reading of an elaborate suicide note. In short: I'd be surprised if this makes it on any ""best beach reads"" lists. I realise that even if this isn't a pleasant read that doesn't mean that it's not a good read, or a meaningful one, so let me elaborate on my mediocre rating for a book so highly praised by many others. I normally don't go for books dealing with depression, telling of a darkness with which I'm unfamiliar and quite uncomfortable, but reading is also about getting outside of your comfort zone. Also, I've got a severe gender inequality problem going on in my 2016 reading list and this book, hailed as an important womanly novel, caught my attention through promises of profundity and humor. The profound is there, in the intentions of the author to tell this deeply personal story, but I found most of the observations made in the book surprisingly superficial. The humor, while there in the earlier parts, felt like vinegar to a thirsty mouth. A perfectly enjoyable riff on the tipping system in New York in one of the earlier chapters gets a bitter taste by the end of the book, becoming a denouncement of one of the many things that are wrong with this world. Despite the lack of living up to what was promised, not all was bad with this book. Plath had the gift of prose, with elegant metaphors and the creation of immersive settings, evoking indelible images like of Esther sitting in the breezeway trying to write a book or a pair of boots pointing to the ocean. She's got a poetic stroke that mixes very well with her cynical side, resulting in a reading experience that was artistically and aesthetically pleasing. It's sad that this first novel is also her last, because the markings of true talents, with a lot of potential to be further developed, were clearly visible. I'm sad for Sylvia Plath and for everyone who shared and shares her plight. I have a great yet tender respect for her, writing this book, which must have cost her a tremendous effort given all the dark clouds in her heavy mind, trapped under a bell jar. But it was not for nothing, because as she was heaving up the bell jar with every word she wrote, trudging along with it in order to be heard, she created something that would make her message heard, then, now and far into the future. Go on, Sylvia Plath, and rest in peace. Your bell will keep resounding, maybe not on sunlit beaches, but definitely in your readers' hearts."

It has always stood apart in Literature because of the way it closely mirrored the author's experiences.Knowing that the novel was published in 1971 I was puzzled to find that the prevailing attitudes, culture and mores seemed to date from an earlier time - at least a decade earlier. The main character, Esther, feels suffocated not only by her own feelings of inadequacy and incipient paranoia, but also by the crushingly mundane life she as a female would be expected to follow. Starting off as an intern on a fashion magazine was possibly one of the worst choices she could make, but at this time there were few realistic options.1950's, I thought, rather than late 60's? And it turns out that yes, it was published under a pseudonym in 1963, a few short months before Sylvia Plath's own suicide at the age of 29.A very chilling tale indeed.

Whee-ee-ee-ee-ee, it shrilled, through an air crackling with blue light, and with each flash a great jolt drubbed me till I thought my bones would break and the sap fly out of me like a split plant. I wondered what terrible thing it was that I had done.”This reminds me of this guy that used to go around the country talking about that moment in time when he hung in the air after jumping from the Golden Gate Bridge. He knew instantly that he’d made a terrible mistake and at that moment desperately wanted to live. When I worked in San Francisco and lived in Richmond, I would sometimes take the Golden Gate Bridge to work and the Bay Bridge on the way back home, to mix things up, or vice versa. Sometimes the traffic report would push me one way or another. After being trapped for three hours waiting for a jumper on Golden Gate to decide if he was really going to do it or finally climb back down, I became paranoid as to whether there would be a jumper every time I climbed into my Jeep to head home. I can remember people standing in groups, cupping their hands around their mouths, yelling for the man to jump. It was the indecision that was so inconvenient. I have to admit, even though it made my stomach sour, that I too wanted a resolution to this interruption in my life. I wanted to be home with my family, a good book, and a glass of wine. We are all capable of such selfish thoughts. I felt the same way at moments in this book. I thought to myself,...Just please get it over with. I can’t take this anymore. How could I possibly think that the loss of a few hours of my life was worth all the rest of someone else’s life? Of course, I don’t believe that when it is put in those stark of terms, but the wait for something to happen was/is nauseating as well. So Esther Greenwood has earned a scholarship to college. She is certainly smart and has come up with a snappy subject for her dissertation, if only she could get around to actually reading Finnegan’s Wake. She has a roommate, Doreen, whom she admires immensely. She seems so self-possessed and free from the burdens of expectations. ”Everything she said was like a secret voice speaking straight out of my own bones.”Esther is pretty enough, not the prettiest of girls, but pretty enough to attract the attention of boys, but of course, men prefer Doreen.There is that aura around Doreen that makes men want to break through that cool exterior to the tiger they can sense lurks beneath.There are hundreds of girls who would be jealous of Esther’s opportunities, but Esther will gladly trade her life for almost any life. The problem is, there is no escape from herself. There is a voice that is slowly turning all the rest of the natives in her head against her. ”If Mrs. Guinea had given me a ticket to Europe, or a round-the-world cruise, it wouldn’t have made one scrap of difference to me, because wherever I sat--on the deck of a ship or at a street cafe in Paris or Bangkok--I would be sitting under the same glass bell jar, stewing in my own sour air.” If only Esther can jump from a bridge and fall far enough, before hitting a safety net, to discover that suicide is not what she wants. What have I done?Of course, the poignancy of reading The Bell Jar is the fact that Sylvia Plath does attempt to kill herself in 1953 in a similar way as Esther does in the book. This may be a novel, but the autobiographical elements of the book make it as real as reading a memoir or Plath’s diary. The tragedy is, of course, that Sylvia, ten years later, does successfully end her own life, so I guess we know the ending of Esther’s life as well. ""Blissfully succumbed to the whirling blackness that I honestly believed was eternal oblivion.""--Sylvia Plath I kept wishing that Esther/Sylvia would work as diligently at finding a reason to live as she did scheming for a way to kill herself. I kept thinking about Anthony Bourdain, Virginia Woolf, and in particular David Foster Wallace; all had many people who admired them and loved them. We think one of the worst things on this planet is to be unloved and how being in that terrifying position would be a reason to be suicidal, but these chemical imbalances that people suffer from tilt the scales of their lives in the wrong direction. It doesn’t matter how much they are loved. I want to unroll the list of things Bourdian has loved and read them to him one by one to convince him that he has much to live for. I want to catch Woolf at the river, pull the rocks from her dress pockets and fling them into the water to sink without her. I want to cut the rope that is dangling from the rafters of Wallace’s house and watch him inhale that first precious gasp of air. I want to walk into Plath’s house in 1963 and turn off the gas and carry her out into the sunlight. Is that what they wanted? A miraculous intervention? Did they want the universe to insist that they live?This book is considered by many to be a masterpiece. The book is certainly unsettling, especially when the reader knows he is basically reading a 234 page suicide note. Wallace, I believe, wrote two pages. Woolf wrote a simple page, but a beautiful one. It is unclear whether Bourdain wrote a suicide note, but given his penchant for prose, I find it hard to believe that he didn’t. I can see how people who are struggling, especially those who are struggling silently, with their mental health would seek this book out. It does seem to help once people know they are not alone or even discover that their problems are not unusual. Does this book help or hinder someone’s own recovery? I don’t know the answer to that. I do think those people who have someone in their life who is grappling with mental health issues would possibly gain some insight into their loved one’s battle with their own mind by reading this book. For those who see the very best in life, it is sometimes difficult to understand why someone would want to kill themselves. When I feel a bit blue, there is always a book to pull from a shelf to take me somewhere else long enough to let the stormy weather in my mind subside. I feel very fortunate that I have discovered such an outlet for my happiness. The victim is not the only victim; suicides leave a lake of tears and recriminations in their wake. If you are suffering and are contemplating suicide, please do continue to search for a reason to live. There is something out there for you. Don’t be dangling in the air before you realize that you really do want to live.

“The silence depressed me. It wasn't the silence of silence. It was my own silence.”
 The Bell Jar is honest, disturbing, powerful, and poignant. It opens with ""the summer they electrocuted the Rosenbergs,"" as if it were an omen of what is to come. Conspicuous and beautiful, it tells a story of despair as a young woman falls to the pitfalls of depression. 
“The trouble was, I had been inadequate all along, I simply hadn't thought about it.”
Sylvia Plath's death haunts every page as depair vanquishes life. Was there ever hope for Esther/Sylvia? Perhaps... However, helplessness and doubts drifts all over as a constant companion while she tries to hold to shreds of her life. 
“I took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart. I am, I am, I am.”
So, there remains a small desire to survive, a desire for freedom to gather strength again to sail with the wind and fly away. And, fragments of realization that we are not alone in our despair.   Sylvia Plath with her superb, alluring and somber writing, holds the reader spellbound and has the power of drawing us into her tale. Her words may hurt, it’s almost impossible not to do so. But Esther/Sylvia also made me laugh with her honest descriptions of the world and the people around her. She made me her accomplice in her hilaraty, in her secrets and in her honesty. Thus, the reader empathizes and is grateful to share with her her pain without appearing miserable or demanding any form of solace. 
“I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.”
 The beauty of The Bell Jar, packed with bleak truths, difficult topics and wryly dark humor surprises and teaches us that our sorrows are simply us being human. This uncovering, if nothing else, should make us grateful.___"

If you've lived with or are fond of someone followed by the Black Dog, this describes the intensity of the feelings (and the treatment) well.Countless critics and reviewers have written about this sad 'memoir' (written as fiction and first published under a pseudonym) about depression, but it is also full of funny anecdotes and perfect insight into American East Coast college girls in the 1950s.Knowing that it’s autobiographical makes it more painful than usual to watch someone curl up in despair, feeling as if she’s been captured under a bell jar, suffocating. Being exceptionally smart, talented, popular and loved is no preventive against depression. She is driven to write, and when she isn’t driven, she fears she’ll never get that feeling again. Therapy, asylums, shock treatment, you name it, it's done to her.I’ve not read Plath’s poems, for which she is much lauded, but I liked the one that was included. I can’t help wondering if she’d lived a generation or two later if she’d have found anything that would have helped her better.Interestingly, to me, are the mentions of feeling some comfort being in a tiny crawl space or wedged between her mattress and the padded headboard.
“It felt dark and safe under there, but the mattress was not heavy enough. It needed about a ton more weight to make me sleep.”
This is reminiscent of Temple Grandin’s hug machine and the similar weights and aids that are used with people on the autism spectrum who may not tolerate real hugs but who crave the relief that pressure can give. There’s now a lot of information about these, but there wasn’t back then. Rooms with no windows feel safe to her, too.Her alter-ego is Esther, and this scene is when she had a month’s internship at the popular Ladies Day magazine. She’s gone there, thinking she’s always wanted to go to graduate school or study in Europe, become a professor and write. But when her boss calls her in and asks her point blank what she wants to do, Esther is astonished to hear herself reply:
“'I don’t really know,' and I recognized it, the way you recognize some nondescript person that’s been hanging around your door for ages and then suddenly comes up and introduces himself as your real father and looks exactly like you, so you know he really is your father, and the person you thought all your life was your father is a sham.”
This sort of thing that we might do ourselves and wonder idly about, has really thrown her. The fact that she gave father as an example is interesting, in that, her father died when she was very young, and she mentions later that she was never really happy after that. So for her to even contemplate as an example the idea of his being a sham tells us how startling she found her impulsive answer: 
“I don’t really know.”
But there are so many funny anecdotes, that it’s not all heavy-going. She drank all the water (including the blossoms) in the first fingerbowl she ever saw (at a wealthy benefactor’s, who kindly didn’t remark on it), and found out only later when a college debutante told her. She dates, teases, goes to parties, joins in plenty of college-aged antics.Her sarcasm and cynicism come through in comments such as this, when she and her med-student boyfriend are outside a delivery room, hearing a woman in labour making a lot of noise. He tells her that the woman is on a drug that will make her forget all about the pain because she’s in a kind of twilight sleep. (Yeah, right.)Esther thinks:
“I thought it sounded just like the sort of drug a man would invent. Here was a woman in terrible pain, obviously feeling every bit of it or she wouldn’t groan like that, and she would go straight home and start another baby, because the drug would make her forget how bad the pain had been, when all the time, in some secret part of her, that long, blind, doorless and windowless corridor of pain was waiting to open up and shut her in again.”
She wants to grow up, become an adult, lose her virginity, become one of them but remain outside of them, whoever they are. The popular crowd. She actually did a pretty good job of straddling the divide, I think, but that may have been part of her undoing. “I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story.From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was EE Gee [her initials], the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, [many more dreams]. . . and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn’t quite make out.I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn’t make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.”There’s an enormous amount of information available about Plath and her work, as there is about Temple Grandin and hers, although they are very different women. Still, I sense some connection there.I enjoyed the writing and have only a bit of criticism about the loose ends that I think she was unable to tie up and that we may think we have figured out, but I'm not entirely sure. I'm sorry she didn't find, as the women in labour were supposed to find, an escape from feeling that a

See comment #25 for my response to another reader who hated the book because they were triggered by the racism and language, especially the use of the ""n -word"" (not the usual ""n-word"", but ""Negro""), which IS what we were taught was the appropriate language in the 1950s.Written in April 1963, this is the ""Letter from a Birmingham Jail"" by Martin Luther King Jr. addressing his fellow clergymen about his work. In it he uses the word 'Negro' 64 times and the word 'black' only 5 times and when talking about 'black nationalists'.https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles..."
37,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7665532-fernando,Rating 4 out of 5,"""Me sentía muy tranquila y muy vacía, como debe de sentirse el ojo de un tornado que se mueve con ruido sordo en medio del estrépito circundante.""Hacía mucho tiempo que quería leer este libro y aunque pensé que iba a encontrarme con una novela que si bien tiene varios momentos depresivos, no los sentí tan profundos, sino que me pareció la historia de una mujer, Esther Greenwood, que simplemente no encaja en ninguna estructura, ni modelo, ni patrón característico de la sociedad y que limita todo su proceder en la vida sin poder salirse de esa campana de cristal a la que se refiere en distintos pasajes de la historia.Es más, he leído un libro más desolador y depresivo que este, el cual recomiendo y que se llama “Huida a las tinieblas”, de Arthur Schnitzler, quien fuera gran amigo de Sigmund Freud. De hecho, este último, gran lector, tomaba ejemplos de los libros de Schnitzler para sus escritos e investigaciones. La historia que narra Schnitzler en “Huida a las tinieblas” es acerca de Robert, un personaje muchísimo más traumado mentalmente, cuyos serios problemas emocionales lo llevarán en un tobogán al desastre total.Volviendo a Esther, observo que su forma de vida es errática, un tanto abúlica y despreocupada. Todas las personas con las que se encuentra no la conforman, ni la ayudan ni la entienden. Especialmente su madre. La experiencia del viaje a New York le crea un vacío muy grande en el espíritu y el corazón y le produce en su vuelta a casa mayores dudas, cae en un laberinto y comienza a desdibujarse. Lo que sí rescato como aspectos totalmente negativos y depresivos del libro son algunas frases que fui anotando. Cito algunos ejemplos: ""Cada vez que trataba de concentrarme, mi mente se deslizaba como un patinador hacia un gran espacio vacío, y allí hacía piruetas, ausente.""""Sentí que me encogía hasta convertirme en un minúsculo punto negro pegado a aquellas mantas rojas y negras y a aquellos paneles de madera de pino. Me sentía como un agujero en el suelo.""""Yo sentí que me fundía en las sombras como el negativo de una persona a quien nunca en mi vida hubiese visto.""""Si uno no espera nada de alguien, nunca de siente desilusionado.""Es imposible dudar que la cuestión autobiográfica de la autora irrumpe de lleno en el personaje, sobre todo en el aspecto de las tendencias suicidas con la salvedad de que en ambos casos, los destinos parecen ser distintos.Si tuviera que agregarle una banda de sonido a este libro, sería la música del disco “Closer”, del grupo Joy Division, con sus frías y sintéticas líneas de bajo. Creo que la voz del también suicida Ian Curtis, cantando el lastimero “Love will tear us apart” sería el tema principal del sountrack.El día que Sylvia Plath se suicidó, luego de dejarle el desayuno a sus hijos y una nota a su marido, el también escritor Ted Hughes, culminando abruptamente su vida desequilibrada, se asemeja en demasía al personaje de Esther. Me da la sensación que este libro le sirvió a Plath como una gran preparación psicológica para ese terrible paso que dio allá por febrero de 1963, al suicidarse introduciendo su cabeza dentro del horno de su cocina.Quedaron sus poemas, sus libros para niños, sus otras novelas, sus diarios y cartas y este libro como prueba premonitoria del trágico final y a la vez, de su entrada al recuerdo de tantos lectores que aún hoy siguen leyendo este libro tan extraño como cautivador."
38,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49815208-marilynw,Rating 5 out of 5,"I had read several articles about Sylvia Plath's life and death over the last several years, having crept up on them slowly because the subject matter is so sad and I can be affected by the sadness of a person's life, in ways that don't feel healthy. I never planned to read The Bell Jar and I'm still a bit surprised that I did so but it was suggested as one of the books to read with members of The Traveling Friends Group and after looking it over, I decided to read it. I've never read Sylvia's poems and haven't ever been interested in poetry, but here was something that Sylvia wrote that might give more insight into her life and thinking and for that reason, the book called out to me. Esther, the main character of the book, was a poor girl living in a rich society, making her way through her high school and college life, financing her education by winning awards and scholarships and working hard to earn money while making top grades, in contrast to the rich students around her who could party, travel, and live the high life while attending college, because they came from wealthy families. At the age of nineteen, she was able to be one of 12 young women who were chosen to intern for a month at a New York fashion magazine and this is where Esther's mental illness began to manifest itself. This is the time in her life when she begins to think (and she is so very wrong but she is sinking into mental illness) that nothing she has ever done has been important, that the only talent she has (winning scholarships) has come to and end, that she can no longer even accomplish that feat anymore, and that all that she had ever wanted no longer interests her at all. She can't even remember why she wanted the things she wanted, she's lost all interest in life, the future, even getting out of bed. We read her descent into madness and the treatment she gets from others (through her eyes only so what we see often may not be reality...but it IS Sylvia's reality) and the treatment she gets from the medical community. Because I know of Sylvia's life and death, and because this book is semi autobiographical, when the book ends, with Esther moving from the asylum where she was last treated, straight to her winter semester of college, after missing the fall semester, we are left with doubts about whether Esther is really going to be okay in the future. I enjoyed Sylvia's writing and her sense of humor, which was there under the cynicism and despair. I don't know how anyone in her condition can be really helped, back in her time or in this time, because I haven't been in that state of mind and health and but my heart goes out to all who feel such despair and worthlessness. Sylvia Plath was a talented women who felt tortured by her mind and talents and this book gives us some insight into what it was like for her. "

Man has no foothold that is not also a bargain. So be it!	-Djuna Barnes, Nightwood
I’ve been side-eyeing this book for a very long time, much as I warily circle any piece of work whose chosen topics happen to lie close to deeply personal experiences of mine. It’s difficult to tell what I fear more from these bundles of paper and ink. The chance of severe disappointment? The possibility of debilitating resonance? Either one would weigh much too heavily on my sensibilities and result in time lost to regaining equilibrium. Not that I grate against having to go through such measures to regain normal functioning in society, mind you. The fact that I have found such measures is a matter that I treasure greatly. It’s just that I would prefer to be careful with the reading material from the start, a methodology which helps me funnel the eventual after-effects into something rewarding with a quick recovery time. This review, for example.What I found in this book was not what I had been expecting. I didn’t even like it at first, the flat and formless prose bleating mundanities and rarely breaking out into the creative bents of lurid glory that I had assumed would compose the entirety. My opinion changed as I went on, as it often does, and I have come to see this straightforward dropping of facts and opinions as a boon, a mark of brilliance almost when it comes to presenting content such as this. For mental illness continues to have a horrid stigma in this society of ours, and it was a mere few years ago that one of my friends was forcefully taken away from a dorm room by a cop to a ��psychiatric boot camp’, which lasted for a week and ended with her furious and shaken and landed with a bill for $8,000. All for having mentioned to her university granted and 'confidential' therapist that she had considered killing herself. As she discussed the events leading up to it, I saw the similarities between her thoughts and mine, and thought about how easily I could have found myself in the same horrible situation. I didn’t realize it then, but this event would play a major role in my eventual dropping out of college, as well as propel me on my way to find my own method of coping with life. For I am defiantly stubborn when it comes to justifying my existence, and refuse to let anyone or anything force me on a path of ‘fixing’ me. In choosing that, I have been much more fortunate than Esther Greenwood, as I have had the time and the space to come to conclusions about my own particular brand of troubles as a female bred for academic success, and how to best deal with them. How life is full of countless little dissatisfactions, and how the mind is so wonderful at subconsciously accumulating each and every one, and how splintered it can become when it is led to believe that happiness is found one way, and then another, as it is betrayed again, and again, and again. How practical one can be in the face of all this, right alongside the absurd choices that rail against every measure of ‘practicality’ defined by everyone and everything around you that simply aren’t all they’re cracked up to be.
I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn’t make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.
It is all too easy to think oneself into a box of ‘if I just did this everything would be alright’ and ‘why can’t I do all this like everyone else is’ and ‘oh I can’t do that because it costs money/wastes time/breaks off the path that is supposed to work for all’. It is all too easy to subconsciously realize how all these ‘proper’ pathways have failed and have led to the simple urge to end it all, when one can see all too clearly how any effort to prolong anything 'proper' is destined for failure. The hard part is figuring out exactly what you want and need. The frontier of the unknown is whether you will be given the means to achieve it.I promised myself a long time ago that when it came to choosing whether to go back to the path that was guaranteed to end in me jumping off a bridge, or to live, I would choose the latter. Every single time. It’s required breaking off a lot of social connections, it’s required sitting down on random sidewalk curbs filled with busy pedestrians until I’ve finished my latest piece of writing, it’s required bursting into tears while reading To the Lighthouse in the middle of a university library because I could see so clearly that the only chance for happiness I had was nowhere on the path that I had been and was expected to lead my whole life on. It’s required a lot of banal events of the same flavor as the ones described in this book, and it’s ultimately required a lot of nonsensical shit that would have landed me in that ‘psychiatric boot camp’ many times over, much of which I can recognize within these pages. And while the events described in this book happened long ago, the attitude towards mental illness today is still one of distrustful hysterics, and I'll be damned if I put my faith in the impositions of the public before I've exhausted every possibility within my own voluntary grasp.You know what? I will never be ‘fixed’, so long as I choose to live. Each day has a chance of containing small wonders, small horrors, small acts of weirdness that keep me going and really don’t oppress anyone or anything else, so long as no one thinks themselves capable of interfering ‘for my own good’ without my completely informed permission. There will be no final day where I find myself capable of living like ‘normal’ people. But so long as I can see a future that compels me on, a future that adheres much more to my own sense of worth than what society and its denizens would like me to believe, I can keep going. To me, that’s all that really matters. And I am grateful to this book for giving me the chance to express it."

42,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66513638-gtf,Rating 4 out of 5,"The protagonist Esther Greenwood is largely based on Sylvia Plath herself. She is a young, aspiring writer who has been given a guest internship at a fashion magazine, and hopes to make it as a poet some day. Unfortunately, Esther is struggling to fight off psychological afflictions that eventually lead to a nervous breakdown. The breakdown that Esther Greenwood experiences in the novel is a portrayal of the breakdown that Plath suffered at age twenty. Esther is completely impaired during her stint with mental illness: barely able to read, speak or think. She is a smart and accomplished woman with a normal exterior, and therefore her breakdown doesn't make much sense. The novel raises the question of whether happy and healthy living is a matter of choice or fate, and explores if there is any hope for people who swear that they are innately flawed. ""I took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart. I am, I am, I am”, one of the most famous quotes from the novel. Plath phrases things beautifully. The tone of the novel is very consistent too. It maintains a dark vibe with a sense longing for the past."

My younger self would not have had the life experience to understand this story on such a profound level.Plath's writing is beyond reproach. I found myself reading many passages over and over again so that I could completely absorb and digest the feelings they invoked in me. ""I wondered why I couldn���t go the whole way doing what I should any more. This made me sad and tired.

She's smart, funny, perceptive and seems to have everything going for her. But she feels less and less connected with life, and in the end just wants to kill herself. Evidently, there must be something wrong with her. Perhaps she would have been okay if only she'd been prescribed the appropriate kind of pills?I thought of The Bell Jar earlier this week when we watched the new von Trier movie, Melancholia. The central character, Justine, who's brilliantly interpreted by Kirsten Dunst, has a fair amount in common with Esther. She's beautiful, successful in her work, and just about to marry a charming man who adores her. We meet her on her way to a fabulous wedding, joking and laughing with her soon-to-be-husband in a white stretch limo which amusingly gets stuck on a narrow road. All the same, it soon becomes clear that Justine isn't enjoying things. Her sister Claire, played by Charlotte Gainsbourgh, keeps telling her to be sensible. Claire's fears are well-grounded. As the evening progresses, Justine behaves more and more erratically. She walks out of her own reception, gratuitously insults the boss who's just given her an unexpected promotion, has random sex with a stranger. Her new husband abandons her as a bad job before the marriage is even a day old. But Justine doesn't seem to care at all.What she's really worried about, we discover, is the mysterious blue planet Melancholia, which is heading towards Earth at an enormous speed. It becomes larger every day. Claire is worried about it too, and sneaks off every now and then to look things up on the Web. Her husband reassures her that scientists have done the calculations. It seems scary, but Melancholia is going to miss us. We'll be fine.Justine knows it won't be fine. She's had a dream where various signs appear. At the end, Melancholia collides with the Earth, destroying both worlds. The prophetic signs have begun to turn up, and she is certain her dream will become reality. The knowledge paralyses her. After the disastrous wedding reception, she moves in with Claire, who does her best to look after her. Justine is clinically depressed. She can't even summon up the willpower to get into her bath, despite Claire's coaxing. Claire makes her favourite meat-loaf. Justine, weeping, says it tastes of ashes.Melancholia comes ever closer, and is now a monstrous shape in the sky. It's finally obvious to everyone that things are not going to work out. Claire goes to look for her husband, hoping he'll once again find words of reassurance, and discovers he's taken an overdose. She is beside herself with fear and grief and runs around hyperventilating, clutching her small son to her. But, to her surprise, Justine has lost her lethargic air. She's full of a grim new energy.With impact now just hours away, Claire does her best to summon up some dignity. She suggests to Justine that they should go out on the terrace with a couple of glasses of wine and wait peacefully for the end.""So we should have a glass of wine?"" asks Justine.""Yes,"" says Claire, completely helpless.""How about some music? Beethoven's Ninth? Perhaps some candles?"" continues Justine remorselessly.""I just want to do this right,"" whispers Claire.""You know what I think of your plan?"" says Justine. ""I think it's a piece of shit.""Needless to say, there is no huge blue planet on a collision course with Earth. And if Esther had only been given the right kind of pills, she would have been fine."

At twenty I tried to dieAnd get back, back, back to you.I thought even the bones would do.But they pulled me out of the sack, And they stuck me together with glue.
These chilling lines from 'Daddy' played inside my head time and again like the grim echoes of a death knell as I witnessed Esther's struggle to ward off the darkness threatening to converge on her. And despite my best efforts to desist from searching for the vestiges of Sylvia in Esther, I failed. I could not help noting how effortlessly Plath must have slipped into the mind of an ingenue like Esther, a thinly veiled version of her younger self, while letting her true disenchantment with life and its unkept promises manifest itself in the iconic poems of Ariel. That she could work up the intellectual rigour to create a body of work unanimously regarded as her very best during a period of tremendous upheaval in the domestic sphere is a testament to her artistic spirit. The personal lives of very few writers have been subjected to a scrutiny as unsparing as Plath's life invited after her suicide and yet her creations have managed to wrest the spotlight from more sensational subjects like a bad marriage and her lifelong battle with a fatal depression. 
People were made of nothing so much as dust, and I couldn't see that doctoring all that dust was a bit better than writing poems people would remember and repeat to themselves when they were unhappy or sick and couldn't sleep.
I had expected a kind of solipsistic navel-gazing to occupy the thematic core of this semi-autobiographical novel but instead what I found was a masterful portrayal of a shared reality of many women of the 50s. For instance, this is evident in Plath's depiction of an attempted rape scene which she describes as drolly as conceivable, with nary a mention of a word suggestive of sexual assault. Such must have been the way of life before second wave feminism wedged its way forcefully into the 20th century zeitgeist. Thus, the bell jar does not merely symbolize death or even the decay of intellectual faculties of an artist which Esther Greenwood equates with death. It also represents the metaphorical prison that Esther and undoubtedly many of her compeers may have wanted to escape - the dilemma between attempting to preserve selfhood at the cost of defying societal conventions and submitting to the patriarchal injunction against female autonomy.
I couldn't stand the idea of a woman having to have a single pure life and a man being able to have a double life, one pure and one not.
Even though Esther lacks Plath's cold fury and resentment as reflected in many of the 'Ariel' poems, she betrays a subliminal fear of her own sexuality and the world she has only just begun unravelling like a mystery. In the last stretch when she contemplates likely methods of ending her life without much ado she does so with an unnerving ease, emotionless as a wax sculpture. Death is like the ultimate remedy to the problem at hand - her inability to cope with her own life any longer. Death also saves her from the tyranny of indecision.
The silence drew off, baring the pebbles and shells and all the tatty wreckage of my life. Then, at the rim of vision, it gathered itself, and in one sweeping tide, rushed me to sleep.
'The Bell Jar' is deeply reminiscent of Susanna Kaysen's Girl, Interrupted, a recent read, which also contains a very disturbing but matter-of-fact autobiographical account of a young girl's brush with the American mental healthcare system. Sadly the parallels between both narratives end at Kaysen's adoption of a distinctly TBJ-esque mode of narration. While Kaysen eventually managed to silence the voices inside her head and went on to pursue a fulfilling writing career, Plath couldn't stand life long enough to leave behind a more voluminous, more enriched oeuvre. 
All the heat and fear had purged itself. I felt surprisingly at peace. The bell jar hung, suspended, a few feet above my head. I was open to circulating air.

48,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45248887-greta-g,Rating 3 out of 5,"This was a book that was recommended to me by a friend (after challenging him to give it a try) so obviously I really wanted to like it as much as he did. Unfortunately, I didn’t. It was a good book, really well written, but there were too many things about it that bothered me. Her idea of feminism, rubbed me up the wrong way. I’m aware this was written in 1953, but still, it almost felt to me as if she hated men, despite the fact she worked with accomplished women in NY, female psychiatrists in the private institution, and was being sponsored by a successful female novelist. She also had fond feelings for her father, whom she lost at a very young age. “So I began to think maybe it was true that when you were married and had children it was like being brainwashed, and afterward you went about numb as a slave in some private, totalitarian state.”“And I knew that in spite of all the roses and kisses and restaurant dinners a man showered on a woman before he married her, what he secretly wanted when the wedding service ended was for her to flatten out underneath his feet like Mrs. Willard's kitchen mat.”“Later Buddy told me the woman was on a drug that would make her forget she'd had any pain and that when she swore and groaned she really didn't know what she was doing because she was in a kind of twilight sleep. I thought it sounded just like the sort of drug a man would invent. Here was a woman in terrible pain, obviously feeling every bit of it or she wouldn't groan like that, and she would go straight home and start another baby, because the drug would make her forget how bad the pain had been,...”Although there’s a nugget of truth in these statements, certainly in those days, they’re obviously as stereotypical as the often heard platitudes among men, that (married) women are bossy and a man loses his freedom and voice once married. I regret that this book is considered by many as classic feminist literature, while to me, this intense pessimistic view only demonstrates her low self-esteem, her anxiety about the future, and her distrust of men ascribable to personal experiences. I also felt uncomfortable by the racist utterance in the book :”Usually it was a shrunken old white man that brought our food, but today it was a Negro. The Negro was with a woman in blue stiletto heels, and she was telling him what to do. The Negro kept grinning and chuckling in a silly way.”“Soon after they had locked the door, I could see the Negro's face, a molassescolored moon, risen at the window grating, but I pretended not to notice.”Her sudden descent into insanity/depression was confusing to me. I understand she struggled with feelings of anxiety and low self-esteem, and with a sense of alienation, but in only a very short period of time, this ambitious woman undergoes a marked change. I think I would have liked the book more if she had explored that transition more deeply. Her prose is of an exceptional beauty, “A thick white china cup was lowered under my nose. In the wan light that might have been evening and might have been dawn I contemplated the clean amber liquid. Pads of butter floated on the surface and a faint chickeny aroma fumed up to my nostrils. My eyes moved tentatively to the skirt behind the cup. ""Betsy,"" I said. ""Betsy nothing, it's me."" I raised my eyes then, and saw Doreen's head silhouetted against the paling window, her blonde hair lit at the tips from behind like a halo of gold. Her face was in shadow, so I couldn't make out her expression, but I felt a sort of expert tenderness flowing from the ends of her fingers.”but to me, the many poetic descriptions distracted from the story and felt incompatible with the deeply disturbed mental state of mind she was trying to convey. Even when she talks about suicide, she seems to have poetic rather than morbid thoughts. ”I waited, as if the sea could make my decision for me. A second wave collapsed over my feet, lipped with white froth, and the chill gripped my ankles with a mortal ache. My flesh winced, in cowardice, from such a death.”“Wrapping my black coat round me like my own sweet shadow, I unscrewed the bottle of pills and started taking them swiftly, between gulps of water, one by one by one.”I haven’t read any of her poems, but I can imagine she is more a poet than she is a novelist. All in all, it was a good book, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to understand how it feels like to suffer a breakdown ; how it used to be treated ; how people react to it and how isolated someone with a breakdown can feel. It’s a bleak journey into one woman’s shattered mind but one that doesn’t offer much hope. “How did I know that someday --at college, in Europe, somewhere, anywhere --the bell jar, with its stifling distortions, wouldn't descend again?”"

Initially, everything is wonderful with the excitement of being in the big-city, working at the magazine, and the gatherings with other young women in the program. But certain things happen that Esther doesn't anticipate and she begins feeling disconnected, unfocused, and anxious. When Esther returns home, she realizes the aspirations she imagines for herself are in conflict with current social norms for women. She feels confined and trapped by these expectations. As these feeling intensify, Esther slowly spirals into a depression that quickly escalates into a mental break...  The Bell Jar is written in the first-person voice of Esther as she shares details of her past and current circumstances. She has a non-conformist viewpoint about sexuality, marriage, and having children, a unique opinion for a woman in the 1950's. My first impression of The Bell Jar is the beauty of Sylvia Plath's writing style and gorgeous prose that is in sharp contrast to the darkness of the story. Esther's journey is raw and frightening and yet the light within the writing continues to draw the reader in. I was completely engaged.The Bell Jar audiobook is narrated by Maggie Gyllenhaal whose first-person voicing brings Esther to life. It feels like you're in her presence as she speaks the words. It's an amazing listen.Some readers may have trouble separating the character, Esther Greenwood from the author, Sylvia Plath. Knowing this novel is semi-autobiographical is a hard reality to swallow. The trigger warnings of depression and suicide should be taken seriously. Parts can be difficult to read and this story stays with you after you're finished, so be concerned. With that said, it's a brilliant piece of Literary Fiction. The Bell Jar is a novel I will remember, perhaps forever. I highly recommend this book to readers who enjoy Classics from the Mid-20th Century with a feminist point-of-view, like I do.5⭐
The Bell Jar was originally published on January 14, 1963 in the U.K. under the pseudonym 'Victoria Lucas'. Sylvia Plath died less than one month later on February 11, 1963.


The Bell Jar was not published in the U.S. until April 11, 1971 per the wishes of Sylvia Path's husband, Ted Hughes.

50,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12497452-jennifer-welsh,Rating 5 out of 5,"4.5I understand suicide newly after reading The Bell Jar. Plath illustrated a perpetual loop of living, which vacillated from one extreme to another. She’d make obsessive effort towards something, even if inconsequential to her life, and became ruthless towards others in this pursuit. Then came the pain and exhaustion from the effort, the rage and resentment with which she pushed the world away to have no responsibilities, that primal resentment that comes from the rage at your mother for birthing you, for putting you here and making you do all the work of living. Finally, her obsessive thinking lead to planning her own suicide, from big picture to details, giving her purpose and drive. She’d escape the loop, only to be engulfed again in a sudden wave. One of the most beautiful passages was when she stood at her father’s grave, and I thought she was finally surrendering to her sorrow, finally letting it wash her clean. Then her mind raced off to a suicide method, just like a good OCD thought will.I’ve always said I’ve learned more about life from fiction than nonfiction. Although I read and enjoy more nonfiction now than I used to, I still think that’s true. Fiction is for the empathic, who learn by invitation to inhabit an individual, a society, a time and/or a place. For me, there’s no learning as deep. I tend to prefer emotional inhabitance of the most intimate kind, where I am transformed by the understanding of a human being different from me, yet with aspects of overlap. I’ve never seriously considered suicide, but I’ve often wished the world would stop, and I’m aquainted with OCD. I know there isn’t one answer to why someone would choose to end their life: Tove Ditlevsen’s Copenhagen Trilogy was a gorgeous work of autobiographical fiction about another female writer who went that way, and although there was overlap between these women, there were also clear differences. But for 10 years I’ve wondered why someone I knew, who seemed to have so many internal resources, took his own life, and Plath’s sharing of her inner dynamics pointed me to a truth about him formerly unknown.Apart from that? It’s a good book. I thought it might feel too young, that I may have missed my time with it. It didn’t. I didn’t. It was the right time."

It's one of the most influential and recognizable novels of modern American literature, and so I figured it was about time I read it. And I loved it.Now, I might be a bit in love with it mostly because I listened to the audiobook narrated by the fantastic Maggie Gyllenhaal. (Seriously, her voice is perfect for Esther's dark & alluring narrative). Regardless of Gyllenhaal's narrative prowess, I thought the story was engaging and compelling in ways I didn't expect.I knew it was going to be depressing, dealing with a young girl's mental breakdown. However, the writing was so lush—reminiscent of Fitzgerald's in Gatsby—and poetic (no surprise since Plath was also a poet). And the story, while listless, never lacked in interesting moments. Esther sort of flits from locale to locale and we get to see inside her head through it all. I loved her wry and judgmental voice. She's not really likeable, but you're able to sympathize her, maybe because she's so manipulative. Either way, I was a big fan of this one. I'd love to read it in print form to see how my experience differs from listening to it. But if you're curious about this one like I was, I can highly, highly recommend it on audio."

And yet she is depressed.The lifestyle at the magazine, with interviews with famous people, caviar, avocado and crab meat filled buffets and movie premieres, reminded me both of the YouTubers and Instagrammers of present day and the opulence of The Great Gatsby.The musings about wanting to do everything perfectly, but not really knowing what she wants to do, feel very modern and millenial like. Also the thought of all her possible futures, as ripe figs at the end of a branching tree flowing from where she was now, and the terror of choosing one and losing the rest, feels very modern.Esther in New York is not necessarily a kind person in my view (in that sense well reflecting the cruelty of youth): leaving a guy standing because he’s to short, having her friend sleep in a pool of vomit and puking in a taxi. Also all the focus on accomplishments and Ivy League education made her less than sympathetic. Her friends are admittingly not the best to be hanging around: the diamond and the confrontation with Marco confused me quite a bit, but also lead to a shift from New York to home and hospitalization.Losing oneself at homeThe more hopeless you were, the further away they hid you.So much sexism comes back in the The Bell Jar, making you understand very well why Esther doesn’t want to ever marry. Her mother tries to come closer to Esther but in the end she just loses all grip (I could feel the tears brimming and sloshing in me like water in a glass that is unsteady and too full). A need for inaction, being done with everything and a wish for abnegation or self destruction follows. Especially moving is a scene where she just wants to disappear beyond reach of anyone she knows (I wanted to be where nobody I knew could ever come) by crawling into a dark space.The all absorbing obsession with possible ways to kill herself, tracts at impersonal asylums, shock therapy and the pressure to feel better but simultaneously feeling like everything is forever the same, are told in a haunting, breathless manner by Sylvia Plath.Reminiscent works and concluding thoughtsThis novel is classic for good reason and while reading it reminded me of quite a lot of other later literary works. The Girl I Left Behind came to mind when Esther visited her hopeful fiance who has tuberculosis. Norwegian Wood in that sense also popped up in my mind, not just because of the clinic at the mountain scenes but also due to emptiness and uncertainty of being young and a student. In that sense this novel also made me think of the work of Sally Rooney, with seemingly successful young people being unhappy. The suicidal thoughts of Esther made me think of one of the storylines in The Hours.And finally the scenes in asylums made me think of the horror writing of Stephen King in The Institute.Reading The Bell Jar is like getting a glimpse of what is under the pavement of everyday life, and in the end Plath keeps the fate of Esther ambiguously powerful. The eloquent way the author captures the alienation depression brings about in small, piercing sentences from Esther, will stay with me for quite some time:I felt very still and very empty, the way the eye of a tornado must feel, moving dully along in the middle of the surrounding hullabaloo.I felt myself melting into the shadows like the negative of a person I’d never seen before in my life.I felt like a hole in the ground"
53,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16842102-mizuki,Rating 2 out of 5,"Some of you may ask ""What were you thinking, Mizuki? Why did you give The Bell Jar only two stars? Isn't this book like, a classic?""I am aware of the fact that Sylvia Plath is a famous poet and The Bell Jar is considered a classic, and I do agree that the writing is poetic and beautiful, the story is also very honest and realistic as well. In fact, Plath's writing and the first half of the book deserve four full stars; but sadly...everything took a nosedive when the heroine suffers a mental breakdown with depression.Here're a few things I'd like to clarify:(1) I understand how sucky and painful it is for a person to suffer depression and become mentally ill. (2) I understand how depressing it is to lose the scholarship you had dreamed of for the longest of time and realize that you are in fact not as special and extraordinary as you had always believed yourself to be.(3) I understand how depressing and suppressing it is for young women of the 1950s to have no way out aside from getting married, having kids and being housewives.(4) I do feel sorry that the main character embarrassed herself in New York when she was surrounded by people from the NY fashion scene and she didn't have a clue about how she was supposed to behave around people from the well respected circles. No one should be humiliated like this.(5) I do feel bad that the MC was later assaulted and beat by a guy, it's a horrible experience. But strangely enough, the MC seemed to burst this experience aside without further mention, whilst she kept moaning and whining about minor things.Still all the great writing and my understanding cannot cover for the insufferable main character, her constant whining and moaning, her complaining about everything and everyone around her.If The Bell Jar is a Young Adult novel, I would have long called the MC out on being such an ungrateful spoiled brat. My stomach was turning over and over with distaste when I read that the Mc's mother single-handedly raised her daughter after her husband passing away, still the MC hated her mother. Nothing the mother did and said could please her, NOTHING.Let's give you one more example:The MC's mother went to the asylum to visit her daughter, she brought her roses because it was her birthday; the mother kept begging her daughter to tell her what she had done so wrong in her childhood which caused her to end up in an asylum. The MC's reaction to this is: ""I hate her.""Bitch, please.I'm not saying the MC's mother is the Perfect Mom, she had her own shortcoming and she doesn't seem to understand what's going on in her daughter's mind. But hey, if you had to insist on hating your mother so much, at least give me some reasons, some explanation, some examples to see why your hatred is justified. Damn it!Not to mention said MC also thought poorly of her female companies/friends and her suitor. In her eyes, those who were in the same age group with her were all boring, shallow, stupid and inferior than her, and God forbid that those girls she met in New York be richer and more worldly than her! It's just unacceptable! Don't get me wrong, many of these girls are in fact vain and unlikable, but it doesn't look like they are all out to get the MC's blood. For God's sake!The great writing also cannot cover for the author's fault in engaging her main character with the readers. As beautiful the writing is and as realistic, vividly written and interesting the story (especially the MC's job in New York and the vanity of the NY fashion scene) is, I still cannot overlook the lack of feeling in the writing and the lack of reasons and explanation beyond characters' personalities and actions. For example, can we manage to see the reason why the MC hated her mother so very much? Nap.I do think it's a painfully honest and realistically, poetically written book, the feeling of pain, emptiness and alienation is beautifully expressed through the writing; and I suspect something has been lost in translation (I read the Chinese version of the book), but in the end I'm still disappointed, I especially don't enjoy how the story goes once the MC got a mental breakdown, after the breakdown, The Bell Jar loses much of its charm in my eyes and things get very, very sandy and boring. What a pity.Plus I honestly don't feel very sympathetic after finished reading the MC's story. Her story to me is more like a story about a girl who thinks she's SO SPECIAL because she's such a straight-A ideal student and she's so much SMARTER and BETTER than anyone her age; but then she goes to New York and realizes she isn't so very special because there are larger fishes in the sea and she meets a bunch of girls who are all from much richer families than hers. Her self-confidence goes to the toilet and eventually she gets a mental breakdown because she's so unhappy with her life. Full stop.It's not a YA, but sadly the story and its MC made me feel like I'm reading one."

We all live in bell jars from time to time. I don't think there is any human being, lived or living, has escaped from being trapped in a bell jar at some point in their lives. The difference is that some of us break through and find our peace and contentment, either by ourselves or with the help of others. But some of us may not be that lucky. Even with the help and care of others, we may not have the strength and courage to break through the confining bell jar. This is the story of us all who are trapped in bell jars. But most importantly, this is the story of we who struggle, heavily and bitterly, and perhaps unsuccessfully, to break from our own bell jars. Sylvia Plath's only novel is semi-autobiographical. This fact makes the work realistic and powerful, for readers cannot disregard that the material was stemming out of her own experience. It is said that there is a thin line dividing the genius and insane, and you can see how true that description is when you read the story. It is truly sad that one must pay a hard price for being a genius. Esther Greenwood, the A-grade scholar, who everyone thinks is lucky and expects to shine in the world, is secretly fighting a dark battle. To the world, she is a genius, a potential future name. But to her, she is nothing but a hopeless wreck, who is qualified for nothing. This devaluation of self drags her to the bottom pit of hopelessness and envelops her with a vacant feeling which grows steadily till she seeks to escape into the unknown. From the failed attempted suicide to the asylum and freedom, she must struggle and struggle and struggle. Is there ever a freedom for her? Will the bell jar be closed on her forever? Sylvia writes truthfully, emotionally, and with power. It's realistic, but unsettling at the same time. There are parts that are gut-wrenching and difficult to stomach. Some parts will bring you completely on your knees. When she wrote “I wanted to tell her that if only something were wrong with my body it would be fine, I would rather have anything wrong with my body than something wrong with my head..."", it truly broke my heart. I wanted to shout at Esther, at Sylvia, and say ""I see you!"" The story is emotionally wrecking. The firsthand narration of a person who descends into a dark abyss is not something easy to read. ""To the person in the bell jar, blank and stopped as a dead baby, the world itself is the bad dream."" The world is a bad dream for the one affected, and the story is one of horror to the one who reads. It is a depressing book. But I'd like to look at it as a beautiful work on mental illness, an anthem of tribute to those who have fallen or will fall into that painful dark abyss. It's tragic that Sylvia Plath had to end her life as she did. But her life, her suffering told to the world through this novel, will be her legacy to us. And The Bell Jar will always be a beautiful representation of her and those who have, and who will walk her path.More of my reviews can be found at http://piyangiejay.com/"

Sylvia Plath's semi-autobiography in which she shares her pain is highly emotional, but brilliant.Her book brings us back to the way women were treated in her day with any signs of mental illness - shock treatment. This was very prevalent during the fifties as I well know - my aunt having been in and out of McLean Hospital in Boston (Belmont) from age 15 till her death. Quite eye opening was Plath's thought process regarding women's sexuality and suicide. Her attitudes and issues are very relevant today.Look for Dr. Nolan, Esther's psychiatrist. Loved her way with patients.With a wonderful drop-back of New England (I'm a Boston gal).Everyone should read this book.4 out of 5 stars."

In that way, this is a mirror of dually the protagonist Esther's, Plath's own, and the reader's emotions. These many layers build upon each other until it becomes hard to tell where each individual's feelings starts and ends, so completely was I caught up in both Esther and Plath's inner-turmoil. Their story became, too, my shared one.This established mood permeates the entire story and becomes as much a part of the tale, as the actual plot. The utterly immersive quality of the writing is what drew me in, captivated my attention and spat me back out again, feeling utterly used, at the novel's close."
59,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9539140-nataliya-yaneva,Rating 4 out of 5,"Да ви се е случвало да хванете настинка, въпреки че сте си слагали шапката и сте си носили вълнените чорапи? Да сте били убедени, че сте направили всичко както трябва в дадена ситуация и все пак съдбата да ви е погодила гадничък номер? Предполагам, че да. Тогава съвсем спокойно депресията би могла да ви дебне зад ъгъла, нищо, че животът ви си изглежда привидно нормален към момента. Спокойно, няма да можете да направите нищо (или както казва баща ми: „Корабът потъва по график“) – просто това е пътят, който трябва да извървите.„Стъкленият похлупак“ е като разходка из обраслата с трънак градина на нечий ум. Мъчителна е и те изподрасква целия. Естър Грийнуд не е от протагонистите, с които читателите се отъждествяват. Хората обикновено прилепват към своите малки частици ежедневие и ги наричат „щастие“. Когато се наситят на това щастие, то се превръща в бреме и монотонност. Тогава започват да си търсят друго щастие. Естър по някакъв почти свръхестествен начин изглежда прескача тези фази и достига до момента, в който се пита „А от тук нататък какво?“. За нея метафората със смокиновото дърво е едновременно възможно бъдеще и сюрреалистично преживяно минало. Тя иска да опита от всичко, но и има усещането, че всичко може би ще има един и същ вкус, ще донесе все същите обикновени човешки емоции – без значение дали е на пътешествие из Европа, в някое кафене в Париж или някъде из Банкок. Защото „everything people did seemed so silly, because they only died in the end“. Защо да правиш каквото и да е, след като накрая просто ще си отидеш? Въпреки болезнената тематика на романа, Силвия Плат описва апатията на Естър, като използва подбран с вкус язвителен тон, изискано чувство за хумор и доста автоирония (аз през цялото време не спрях да си мисля, че всяко усещане на Естър е всъщност нещо, изпитано от Силвия, макар романът да е само отчасти автобиографичен). 50-те години на миналия век в САЩ са време на „врява и безумство“, белязано от Студената война, икономически растеж, сексуални табута, строго разграничение на ролите на мъжа и жената, стремеж към образа на перфектната домакиня, ерата на Елвис Пресли, Мерилин Монро и pin-up гърлите. Време на оформяне на калъпи. Някъде прочетох, че на Естър ѝ липсвала емоционалност и всички описания в романа били доста клинични. Аз смятам, че това е вследствие на изпепелена прекомерна емоционалност. Нещо като burnout на чувствата – изпитваш толкова много чувства и за толкова много неща, че накрая се изчерпваш и оставаш неспособен да продължиш да изпитваш. В крайна сметка има нещо неестествено. Още през Просвещението фокусът се премества върху отделния индивид и всеки следващ период се старае да подготвя по-осъвременена версия на изначалния манифест на хуманизма. Въпреки тези опити обаче, преди едва 50-60 години в най-напредналата страна на света няма кой да чуе вика за душевна помощ на една млада жена. Да, тогава, разбира се, ги е имало лоботомията и електрошока, но те са сериозна стъпка назад в традицията на човеколюбието. „Стъкленият похлупак“ е търсене на смисъла на живота. Отказ от конформизма и обезверяване пред перспективата за наложени модели. Човек, който е имал смелостта да си зададе въпроса „Защо трябва да правя като всички останали?“, заслужава уважение. Заслужава и отговори. Най-вече заслужава да ги открие по своя начин."
60,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51395417-brian,Rating 2 out of 5,"“I felt dreadfully inadequate.”Ugh.That is how I felt after finishing this book. Thank goodness it is short, because when I decided I could not stomach it for more than a few pages at a time, it would have taken more forever to finish otherwise.There is no joy in “The Bell Jar”. No hope. And I have read many books where that is the case. The problem with this book is that there is no point to any of it. No real characterization, no depth. As I read this text I kept thinking of “The Catcher in the Rye”, another underwhelming experience for me. I think both texts suffer from protagonist problems, and both are products of their time and they did not age well.I could be nice and blame the time of year I read it, in between Thanksgiving and Christmas, for my dislike but that would be a cop out. 200 pages of how one would like to commit suicide. That’s a book? Maybe with a compelling characterization, or with more than a shallow examination of motivating factors for such thoughts, but this surface examination is a misfire on both counts.I honestly don’t know what else to say about “The Bell Jar”. I can appreciate the skill of the writer. There are flashes of it in this book. Plath was a great poet, but a novelist, no. I think this text is one of those where its “greatness is thrust upon it” by people who wanted it for various agendas. If just standing alone, it does not merit any such claim. I did find I was engaged in the last 20 pages or so, where the book shifts gears, but that also may have been because I knew I was almost done. And I would not be picking it up again."
61,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/108125111-persephone,Rating 4 out of 5,Sylvia Plath's ability to navigate such a complicated topic and also serve us a prose that is so vivid and intense will never fail to amaze me.
62,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26876584-joe,Rating 5 out of 5,"I feel the way about The Bell Jar that other readers feel about Catcher in the Rye. Rather than J.D. Salinger's anti-hero Holden Caulfield labeling everything in sight as ""phony"", my preference is Sylvia Plath's thinly veiled account of her summer in New York, interning as a guest editor at Mademoiselle and her descent into depression and the mental health system that fall, with Plath's vivacious wit plunging me into the almost sheer terror of looming adulthood. Published in England in January 1963 under the pseudonym ""Victoria Lucas,"" The Bell Jar was the first novel by the poet and also her last. Plath, whose marriage to poet Ted Hughes had dissolved, was living in a bare London flat with two children and no telephone in one of the coldest British winters on record. Anxiety over her future and overwork had contributed to Plath's suicide attempt in 1953. Ten years later, in February 1963, a kitchen oven finished the job; Plath was dead at thirty.Hughes had assured Plath's mother Aurelia that The Bell Jar would remain unpublished in America during Mrs. Plath's lifetime to spare her the pain of her daughter's brutally honest critiques, but the demand for Plath's work had spiked with the rise of women's liberation. When Random House planned to exploit a provision in the copyright laws of the time and publish the novel, Hughes agreed to release The Bell Jar in America through his publisher Harper & Row in 1971. It remained on the New York Times bestseller list for six months. Aurelia Plath related her version of events with a book of her daughter's correspondence, Letters Home, in 1975.Plath's anti-heroine Esther Greenwood is nudged out onto a big river in a basket and I felt like I was holding on with her, ready to tip over and drown at any turn. Esther attempts to navigate her way into adulthood and Plath conveys how dangerous it was to be a young woman in the 1950s. Regardless of our differences, I found myself able to relate to Esther's perils. This is a world where one missed assignment, one social faux pas or one dangerous encounter with the opposite sex could spin a life of promise into tragedy. The pressures are enormous and the consequences real, without any embellishment or drama on the author's part.Sylvia Plath interviewing Elizabeth Bowen in New York. June 1953.From a great opening paragraph --It was a queer, sultry summer, the summer they electrocuted the Rosenbergs, and I didn't know what I was doing in New York. I'm stupid about executions. The idea of being electrocuted makes me sick, and that's all there was to read about in the papers--goggle-eyed headlines staring up at me on every corner and at the fusty, peanut-smelling mouth of every subway. It had nothing to do with me, but I couldn't help wondering what it would be like, being burned alive all along your nerves.-- to an expertly timed final page, Plath's wit and sensuality knocked me over throughout the book. When we came out of the sunnily lit interior of the Ladies' Day offices, the streets were gray and fuming with rain. It wasn't the nice kind of rain that rinses you clean, but the sort of rain I imagine they must have in Brazil. It flew straight down from the sky in drops the size of coffee saucers and hit the hot sidewalks with a hiss that sent clouds of steam writhing up from the gleaming, dark concrete.Esther's fear and looming anxiety over the future waiting for her is palpable.For the first time in my life, sitting there in the soundproof heart of the UN building between Constantin who could play tennis as well as simultaneously interpret and the Russian girl who knew so many idioms, I felt dreadfully inadequate. The trouble was, I had been inadequate all along. I simply hadn't thought about it. The one thing I was good at was winning scholarships and prizes, and that era was coming to an end.Certain folks in the book club or discussion group might consider The Bell Jar a sad or depressing read. Not me. Plath's writing has an vitality and clarity that propelled me through in under a day, but more importantly, reminded me of what it is to feel alive. So many of the people Esther comes into contact with seem to be dying in front of her in one way or another. Esther dreams of escape from that sort of life, She doesn't want to be the spot an arrow shoots off from. She wants to be the arrow.Lisa Simpson was spotted reading Plath in The Simpsons, Season 20: Episode 11, ""How the Test Was Won"".Rory Gilmore entered her Plath phase early, in Gilmore Girls, Season 1: Episode 12, ""Double Date"". Gwyneth Paltrow played Plath in a 2001 feature film. Maggie Gyllenhaal seemed to be playing a pulp version of Plath in Secretary, released the following year.Alvy Singer threw Plath a backhanded compliment in Annie Hall (1977). Considering what happens in his relationships, Alvy's understanding of women bears scrutiny."

Contrary to pop culture and the Encyclopedia of Feminist Literature, writers such as Sylvia Plath, Anais Nin, Dorothy Parker and Kate Chopin were not feminist. In actuality, they were spoiled little brats who justified their actions by telling people they were artist who chose to live like men in order to give the finger to the system. Harsh, but no less true. And speaking of harsh, hopping beds with people you don't care about on a personal level, don't care if they're committed to another person, and have no desire to see in the future really does make you no better than the man you called a ""filthy, whoring dog"". If anything, it makes you worse because you know better. It also doesn't make you a feminist.Being a feminist is more than simply bitching about the establishment and how it aims to keep you down. It's about more than keeping an ever-vigilant eye on the media, the people in your circle, and anyone else you choose to blame for holding you back and cry misogyny to anyone who will listen. And, in case no one told you, it is about more than using sex as a weapon. And finally, being a feminist is not whining about your inability to rise higher than men will allow... it's about having the courage to break the glass ceiling on your own regardless of limitations put upon you. Ladies, you better recognize!As for the story, it was beyond disappointing. Filled with a cast of feminist archetypes exaggerated to the point of being caricatures, Plath never fully delves into the deterioration of Esther nor the people surrounding her. Esther simply goes from being a shallow, neurotic hypocrite with no discernible personality of her own to a hot mess without rhyme or reason. Is it because she had some time off from school and actually had time to examine her life? Is it because she couldn't actually pick one singular path or goal? Did she have pretty-girl guilt? Is it because she was on her way to loosing her spot in wealthy society? The world will never know and I no longer care.If feminist reading is what you interested in, I suggest Maya Angelou, Naomi Wolf, Kate Millet, or Betty Frieden. "

66,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36555254-robin,Rating 5 out of 5,"The thought that I might kill myself formed in my mind coolly as a tree or a flower.I read this with the compulsive speed of a runaway train. Sylvia Plath's only novel written shortly before she committed suicide is braided into the story of her tragic life, and told through through the character of Esther Greenwood, a young woman struggling under a tremendous hopelessness and depression.It begins with what should have been an inspiring time in Esther's life - a month in New York and a writing internship. Instead, she finds falseness and absurdity in everything, her mind often turning to emptiness, silence and death.A dispassionate white sun shone at the summit of the sky. I wanted to hone myself on it till I grew saintly and thin and essential as the blade of a knife.She toys with ideas of suicide much of the book. Her life is cloaked in a claustrophobic solitude, well described by the idea of being under a bell-jar, which suffocates and immobilizes.The air of the bell jar wadded round me and I couldn't stir.Her descent to madness, and her fight against life bring her to an asylum where she receives electroshock treatments and psychotherapy.Certainly because she was writing from experience, Plath captures in a painfully realistic fashion the mindset of someone teetering on the edge of of the world. Esther is swathed in a thick cotton through which no one can touch her, mummified in airless despair. The book is terrifying in that aspect and sickened me, because this was reality for the author, and for many others suffering as she did.Plath also touches on the societal constrictions which, like a straightjacket, bind a woman's identity. Esther can't bear the thought of a conventional 1950's life ""when you were married and had children it was life being brainwashed, and afterwards you went about numb as a slave in some private, totalitarian state."" The men in this book are mainly oppressors, despite being her intellectual inferiors. She dreams about being a writer of books of poetry, but this doesn't seem to match up with what she sees as an inevitable, doomed path laid out for her.It's written so well. It's very readable, with glittering insight and imagery into the interior world of Esther Greenwood, and the uncomprehending people around her. It makes me wish that somehow this insight could have translated into a different ending for Sylvia Plath, for a lifting of the bell jar. As for Esther, we are allowed a glimmer of hope. I took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart. I am, I am, I am."

I felt terrible.”  I feel incredibly conflicted over Sylvia Plath’s The Bell Jar. On the one hand, I found it to be an ingenious and striking read, one that immortalizes in exacting detail a young woman’s slow descent into psychosis and offers a piercing commentary on 1950s American society, specifically its oppressive gender norms. On the other hand, I could not look past how racist it was. Set in 1953 The Bell Jar is narrated by Esther Greenwood, a misanthropic 19-year-old from the suburbs of Boston who wins a summer internship working for a New York fashion magazine. For the most part, Esther’s voice is a winning combination of acerbic and witty. She often entertains morbid thoughts, she offers scathing assessments of those around, and, as the days go by, she seems to be steadily sinking into torpor. Although Esther tries to make the most of New York, she quickly becomes disenchanted by its supposedly glamorous scene. She is at once repulsed and appreciative of the girls who are interning with her. While Esther is drawn to Doreen, who is one of the livelier of the girls, and Betsy, a pious goody-two-shoes, she ultimately feels very much apart from them, and often seems to view them and the rest of New York through a glass darkly. What follows is Esther's unsettling descent into depression. As her contempt towards others and life in general grows, she begins to engage in self-destructive behaviour and acts in increasingly irrational ways. Later on, Esther attempts to write a novel but her deteriorating mental health becomes a concern to her mother who forces her to see a psychiatrist who goes on to prescribe her electroconvulsive therapy. This ‘treatment’ goes awry and Esther worsens. Eventually, Esther is committed to a hospital where she is reunited with an old acquaintance. While the novel does end on a hopeful note, it is by no means an easy ride. It is brutal and unsparing. Throughout the course of this novel, Plath captures with razor-sharp precision the mind of an alienated young woman. She articulates Esther’s ugliest thoughts and fears. As Esther tries and fails to navigate adulthood in New York she becomes more and more withdrawn. She’s apathetic, pessimistic, and derisive of others. Her experiences fail to match her expectations and Esther struggles to make sense of who she is, who she wants to be, and who she ought to be. She’s suffocated by the limitations of her gender and seems to reject the visions of womanhood, of marriage, and of motherhood that American society presents her with: “when you were married and had children it was like being brainwashed, and afterwards you went about numb as a slave in some private, totalitarian state.”Not only does Plath render the stultifying atmosphere of the city and of the circles Esther moves in, but she conveys the lethal ennui experienced by her protagonist. In New York Esther struggles to traverse from adolescence to adulthood. Her alienation from others, her self-estrangement, and her disconnection from her contemporary society pave the way to her eventual breakdown. When others attempt to ‘help’ and/or ‘cure’ Esther they cause more harm than good. They either treat her in an inhumane way or dismiss the severity of her condition.Esther is certainly not a likeable heroine. She’s a mean snob who often views other people as grotesque and beneath her. But, as I read on, I came to pity her. In spite of her solipsisms and general nastiness, Esther is clearly suffering. Esther’s mother seems to care more about appearances than her daughter’s wellbeing. The men around seem unable to truly see her. Her former sweetheart doesn’t really know her, while the men she meets in New York seem all too eager to use her. As Esther’s desperation grows her view of the world becomes steadily more distorted, her imagination even more ghoulish.I appreciated how effective Plath’s style is in rendering Esther’s mental state. At times a scene or one of Esther’s thoughts are depicted in such vivid detail as to be overwhelming. But, the story also plays around with linear storytelling, presenting us with fragmented conversations or scenes that we are able to understand only as we read on. At times her prose acquires a sticky quality that fits perfectly with the story’s initial summer backdrop. So what could possibly cause me to give this novel 3 stars instead of say 4 or 5? Well, while I recognise that this is a seminal feminist work, I could not look past how racist Esther, Plath’s ‘alter ego’, was. While I can usually look past classics’ books using dated/non-pc language, Esther’s racist remarks/attitudes did not strike me as merely being symptomatic of ‘the times’. It’s totally ‘okay’ if our college-educated and intellectual protagonist, who is critical of the accepted social norms of her time when it comes to gender-based inequalities, uses racial slurs. Sure. She’s white and it's the 1950s. But then we have these instances where Esther is not feeling good and mistakes her reflection as belonging to somebody else, specifically someone who is Asian: “I noticed a big, smudgy-eyed Chinese woman staring idiotically into my face. It was only me, of course. I was appalled to see how wrinkled and used-up I looked.” and “The face in the mirror looked like a sick Indian.”.When a girl says she’s meeting up with a Peruvian guy Esther says the following: “They’re squat,” I said. “They’re ugly as Aztecs.”....And then we have that scene at the hospital involving a Black orderly. After establishing that he is indeed Black she keeps referring to him as “the negro” rather than say “the orderly” or “the man”. This orderly say things like “Mah, mah!” or “Oh Miz, oh Miz […] You shouldn’t of done that, you shouldn’t, you reely shouldn’t.”. Before this (as far as i can recall of course) Plath did not lay much (or any really) emphasis on her characters’ accents. Yet, all of a sudden she just has to establish the specific way in which this man talks. And of course, because he’s an orderly and Black the way he talks has to be stereotyped. Anyway, Esther believes that the orderly is toying with her and the other patients so she “drew my foot back and gave him a sharp, hard kick on the calf of the leg”. Great stuff. Plath’s description of non-American characters also left a sour taste in my mouth: “She was six feet tall, with huge, slanted, green eyes and thick red lips and a vacant, Slavic expression.” and “A large, bosomy Slavic lady”. Wtf is that even supposed to mean? How fucking lazy is this type of description? Why are all ‘Slavic-looking’ women large? While Esther uses unflattering terms to describe white Americans, describing someone’s neck as “spam-coloured”, these descriptions, which poking fun at their physical appearance, are ultimately humorous. The ones referring to Black or Asian characters, not so much. Esther’s repugnance is even more pronounced in the instances I mentioned above, and the language she uses is often dehumanising or at least seems to suggest that she does view them as inferior to white people. Every few chapters I would come across a racist remark/line that simply prevented me from becoming invested in Esther’s story. That this is a highly autobiographical novel makes me feel all the more uneasy at Esther's racism.While this is certainly an important novel and one of the first books to depict in such uncompromising terms a young woman’s descent into depression, its white American brand of feminism is dated at best."
68,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24476089-annie,Rating 5 out of 5,"I remember reading this short story in Asimov’s magazine about a very young girl who suffers from autism. She moves at her own pace, dragging herself at the heels of the rushing time and existing in that void where her consciousness treads a gravelly path only to arrive at the destination to find that everyone else had already moved on. So that when she answers her mother to a question that was asked of her three weeks ago, her mother doesn’t really understand her because she had already moved on from that question. For the life of me, I can’t seem to be able to remember the name of the story. But it probably was the best darnest short story I will ever read. And it seemed to wave, lazy like a flag in a winter night with the trifle of winds, in the nook in the behind of my head that was spared by the brutal voice of Esther Greenwood, throughout my reading of The Bell Jar. I failed to grasp at the significance of this remembrance until I came across this line that helped put everything in blinding focus:
I felt very still and empty, the way the eye of a tornado must feel moving dully along in the middle of the surrounding hullabaloo
For The Bell Jar is an account of Sylvia Plath’s own experiences, Esther a fait accompli , a flesh that she constructed of her own imagination , to allow a look into her own life through a ‘a curtain of clear water’. Or a bell jar. It is an anxious and unsettling novel. On one hand there is a young girl who a younger me, stripped of the vagaries of time and experiences, nodded along with vigorously and vehemently and found a winning kinship with. A world away from my own childhood, yet the voice of Esther spoke of the dawn of youth with such clarity and a bluntness that can only be expected off the mouth of a child. And then the descent of the bell jar, the glassy apparition that separated her from the world into her own, looming like a black cloud, slowly and sleathily crept in. She feels separate from the rest of the world, so disassociated that it feels to her as though even the air that she breathes is separate and ‘sour’. The unflinching prospect of death as the final destination causes her to question the merit of the frivolities of everyday life, the depression finally pushes her to try and take her own life. My reading of this book was a sad one. Knowing that it was not just a story, knowing that the haunting witticisms was a result of a Schizophrenia (although she was never officially diagnosed) and in full possession of the knowledge of the finality that ripped this brilliant voice at the young age of thirty. Yet, knowing full well, how the story really ends, shouldn’t drive one to perceive this as a book about depression. Although it deals with the part of Plath’s life that romanced with death with her many attempts at suicide, it is also the voice of a girl who refused to conform. The Bell Jar is also a text on social critique. Set in the 50’s with it’s strict societal constraints , Plath shreds the accepted notions of what it was she was supposed to be, and attempts to replace them with what she wanted to be. No wonder that it became one of the centrepieces of feminism. But, in the end what really gripped me was her brutal honesty and the genius that she potrayed in evoking reality through her prose. For when she wrote:
The Silence depressed me. It wasn’t the silence of silence. It was my own silence.
I realised how stifling it must have felt to have realised such glaring truths in her own alienated world, separate in her understanding and alone in her trials. Update(14/11/2015) : The short story I mention is Movement by Nancy Fulda.I read it last year while sitting on a bench in a bus station waiting to come back home after a particularly intense and gruelling internship. The bus was late by hours due to floods and it was cold and rainy and just one of those particularly miserable winter nights that make you miss your bed and your mom's special 'cold day' dish.I remember reading this story from an old, badly dog eared copy of the Asimov magazine and the moment of inner silence that follows the completion that tells you that this is a book that is going to remain with you. I distinctly remember the details in the story, and the shadow of silence that descended as I made my way through this. But, soon after the bus arrived and I forgot the copy of the magazine. I left it behind on the bench and ever since, try as I might, I couldn't bring the name of this story to my mind. It was lost like the magazine. Until I mention it here, and two wonderful people tell me the issue, the title, the author... Ah! I love Goodreads! Thank you to Kim and Joe for helping clear the mist! "

I vaguely remember it from college, but I found it much more meaningful on this reread. The Bell Jar is the story of Esther Greenwood, a young woman who is struggling with depression and mental illness. She's always gotten good grades at school and has won scholarships, but now she's feeling pressured to choose a career or get married. Esther realizes she doesn't want to do either, so she decides to kill herself. ""I felt dull and flat and full of shattered visions.""The novel is structured in flashbacks, and Esther tells us stories from her life in the 1950s. Some of these situations are so amusing that I laughed out loud; others are so sad that it was heartbreaking to remember that this novel was semi-autiobiographical. The truth is that Sylvia Plath killed herself in February 1963, just a month after this book was published in England. Sylvia writes beautifully, and her descriptions of depression and angst were both poetic and realistic. What I most appreciated about this book was how it seemed like a feminist essay, because Esther felt so suffocated with the few choices allowed to women. ""The trouble was, I hated the idea of serving men in any way.""I was also impressed with how relevant this book felt, despite being more than 50 years old. As Frances McCullough wrote in the Foreword: ""The issues haven't changed ... The big questions: how to sort out your life, how to work out what you want, how to deal with men and sex, how to be true to yourself and how to figure out what that means — those things are the same today.""I decided to pick up The Bell Jar after reading a heartfelt essay about it in Ann Hood's bookish memoir Morningstar. Hood wrote about how much Sylvia Plath's novel meant to her, and now I understand exactly what she meant. Highly recommended.Favorite Quotes""I felt very still and very empty, the way the eye of a tornado must feel, moving dully along in the middle of the surrounding hullabaloo.""""All my life I'd told myself studying and reading and writing and working like mad was what I wanted to do, and it actually seemed to be true, I did everything well enough and got all A's, and by the time I made it to college nobody could stop me.""""I'd discovered, after a lot of extreme apprehension about what spoons to use, that if you do something incorrect at table with a certain arrogance, as if you knew perfectly well you were doing it properly, you can get away with it and nobody will think you are bad-mannered or poorly brought up. They will think you are original and very witty.""""I hate handing over money to people for doing what I could just as easily do myself, it makes me nervous.""""I thought how strange it had never occurred to me before that I was only purely happy until I was nine years old.""""I felt dreadfully inadequate.

I knew that Catholics thought killing yourself was an awful sin. But perhaps, if this was so, they might have a good way to persuade me out of it. Of course, I didn't believe in life after death or the virgin birth or the Inquisition or the infallibility of that little monkey-faced Pope or anything, but I didn't have to let the priest see this, I could just concentrate on my sin, and he would help me repent. The only trouble was, Church, even the Catholic Church, didn't take up the whole of your life. No matter how much you knelt and prayed, you still had to eat three meals a day and have a job and live in the world.""""I also hate people to ask cheerfully how you are when they know you're feeling like hell and expect you to say 'Fine.'""""What I hate is the thought of being under a man's thumb ...

70,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56111743-roman-clodia,Rating 5 out of 5,"Update: July 2019 (original review below)Given how much I love Plath's poetry and journals, it's been nagging me that this novel of hers didn't work that well for me - it felt flat and 'told' in a monotone, so unlike Plath's usual visceral, high-octane words. Rather than re-reading I listened to the audiobook and wow!, Maggie Gyllenhaal's reading clicked immediately. She captures all the nuances of Esther's voice: the monotone, yes, but also the acid-bite of her wit, the self-deprecating sharpness, the fear of electric shock treatments, the always-on voice of internal censure and criticism, the solipsism - that ended up making this one of the most horrific exposures of patriarchy, the quest for culturally-constructed female perfectionism, and the struggle for self-identity that I've read. Of course, given this novel's placement in the calendar of Plath's life and death, it's impossible to read it 'innocently' - but yes, I *knew* this would be a book for me if only I could find a way in. -------------------------------------------------
I am I am I am
As much as I love Plath, her poetry and her journals, this novel has never worked for me. I first read it as a teenager, and it was my first introduction to Plath’s writing and, even then, I was underwhelmed. I wondered if re-reading it now in the light of her poetry would change my response – but no, this still feels weak and slightly unfinished or unrealised.Drawing on Plath’s internship at a NY magazine and her subsequent breakdown, we can certainly see the themes of her writings beneath the contours of the story: the tension between what a woman is supposed socially and culturally to be and her internal realities; ambition and writing; the power plays of sex and desire; the ego vs. the ‘nice’ girl. And from the start there’s something subtly ‘off’ about Esther’s voice, a casual, nagging, wrongness that alerts us to the fact that this is not going to follow traditional paths or end happily. All the same, for a writer with such a powerful, bruising, harsh and dynamic style of wordcraft, even in her journals, this feels a little bland. It’s always worth a read especially if poetry, Plath’s true medium, isn’t your thing but it’s not a text that showcases Plath at her exciting, energetic, painful and corrosive best."
71,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45198798-leynes,Rating 3 out of 5,"The Bell Jar started off in such a promising way. Up to the halfway point I was convinced I'd rate the book 5 stars, despite its blatant (and unchallenged) use of racist slurs (especially Anti-Asian and Anti-Black slurs and depictions can be found in this book, so beware of that!). I just loved how Plath captured the feeling of feeling lost (as a woman in the big city, as a graduate entering the working field, as a human looking into the world's future). The book was refreshing in its honesty. But for some reason, the second half of the story, once Esther was hospitalised in the mental health institution, fell flat for me. It felt like the plot wasn't moving forward and no new aspects were added to the story. Ultimately, I had to bump my rating down to 3 stars due to its narrative structure and its harmful language. (TWs also for fatphobia, rape, ableism and homophobia)
It was a queer, sultry summer, the summer they electrocuted the Rosenbergs, and I didn't know what I was doing in New York. I'm stupid about executions. The idea of being electrocuted makes me sick, and that's all there was to read about in the papers—goggle-eyed headlines staring up at me on every street corner and at the fusty, peanut-smelling mouth of every subway. It had nothing to do with me, but I couldn't help wondering what it would be like, being burned alive all along your nerves.
This is the first paragraph of The Bell Jar, and it serves not just as a perfect opening, it also captures the spirit of the entire novel. This first paragraph already sizzles with life. You get the feeling that our narrator has a lot to say, that she's quite clever, snarky even. She's good at observing things. She likes to put herself in the centre. She feels young, curious about life. Plath's writing is effortless. It feels quite modern, even though the mention of the Rosenbergs clearly puts the novel in the early 50s.Many modern readers (especially young white women) seem to be able to relate to Esther. And I understand why. I truly do. In the first few chapters, Plath does an amazing job at making her heroine approachable. Yes, she's problematic and highly judgemental of other people ... but she's also cynical and sarcastic, she doesn't know what to do with her future and feels overwhelmed, yet she's also perfect at assessing her situation in a realistic and funny way.
I knew something was wrong with me that summer, because all I could think about was the Rosenbergs and how stupid I'd been to buy all those uncomfortable, expensive clothes, hanging limp as fish in my closet, and how all the little successes I'd totted up so happily at college fizzled to nothing outside the slick marble and plate-glass fronts along Madison Avenue. I was supposed to be having the time of my life.
And aren't these sentiments something most of us can relate to? The pressure you feel after graduation, the pressure to ""make it"", get a good job, start a family, or whatever it is. Esther feels it too. And she feels it in a way that rings true to Plath's readers. Esther muses: ""Look what can happen in this country, they'd say. A girl lives in some out-of-the-way town for nineteen years, so poor she can't afford a magazine, and then she gets a scholarship to college and wins a prize here and a prize there and ends up steering New York like her own private car. Only I wasn't steering anything, not even myself.""Living through our third pandemic year, of having so many things in our lives be uprooted, of looking into a future that looks so fucking bleak and doomed, many of us will feel like we aren't the ones sitting behind the steering wheels of our own lives. It is external forces that govern us. Plath speaks to a truth that most of us had to quietly admit to ourselves. That ours is a generation that probably won't reach the mountain top, we are quite literally headed into the other direction.It's something all of us have to face, even though it's hard. We keep procrastinating our lives away, we keep suppressing the knowledge of what the looming climate crisis will eventually do to our lives and the lives of our children. Doing anything meaningful with one's life can feel really fucking meaningless in times like these.
'What do you have in mind after you graduate?' 'I don't really know,' I heard myself say. I felt a deep shock, hearing myself say that, because the minute I said it, I knew it was true.
Esther feelings of feeling lost and lonely and overwhelmed are signs of her depression. She doesn't know what to do with herself and her life. And she so desperately wants to feel something. As someone who struggles with depression as well I saw myself in a lot of Esther's thoughts. It was a bleak and unsettling feeling, but also reassuring, knowing that one isn't alone with these thoughts. That's another reason why I think The Bell Jar still speaks to young audiences today. It's relatable and honest in a way that few books are. The Bell Jar also speaks to a specific female truth. Yes, Plath centres whiteness, and therefore some of her feminist endeavors aren't universally applicable, but I still think that many women know the experiences that Esther and her girlfriends live through to be true. Sexual assault, rape and the belittling of women are continuously portrayed throughout the narrative. Whether it's Esther's friend's fear of her own lover – ""'Stick around, will you? I wouldn't have a chance if he tried anything funny. Did you see that muscle?' Doreen giggled."" – that is masked by laughter and ""lightheartedness"", the constant gaslighting she receives from doctors, or her meetings with men who treat women like ""a playing card in a pack of identical cards [that] happened to be dealt to him.""Esther's advocacy against marriage is also something that will resonate with many modern girls and women. Among the most iconic quotes in this book are the ones in which Esther muses about marriage:
That's one of the reasons I never wanted to get married. The last thing I wanted was infinite security and to be the place an arrow shoots off from. I wanted change and excitement and to shoot off in all directions myself, like the coloured arrows from a Fourth of July rocket.
I mean, how great is that? Or her thinking to herself ""The trouble was, I hated the idea of serving men in any way. I wanted to dictate my own thrilling letters."", after her mother suggests attending a typing course.Esther, despite her flaws and problems, is an easy character to root for. I would assume it's easier for people who are more likely to look past her overt racism, but even as a Black women, I empathised with how hard her life is, not only as a woman in the 50s (her fighting off a rape at a party is among the most harrowing scenes in this book) but also as a woman with mental health issues. Plath does a great job at showing how the medical system failed her.
I thought it sounded just like the sort of drug a man would invent. Here was a woman in terrible pain, obviously feeling every bit of it or she wouldn't groan like that, and she would go straight home and start another baby, because the drug would make her forget how bad the pain had been, when all the time, in some secret part of her, that long, blind, doorless and windowless corridor of pain was waiting to open up and shut her in again.
Esther is belittled by doctors and her parents, especially her mother, when it comes to her depression and illness. They keep suggesting that she can basically will herself to be healthy again. All her mother wants is for her to be a ""good girl"" again. When hospitalised, her mother tells her that she should be ""grateful"" because she had ""used up almost all her money"". Esther thinks to herself: ""I knew I should be grateful to Mrs Guinea, only I couldn't feel a thing. If Mrs Guinea had given me a ticket to Europe, or a round-the-world cruise, it wouldn't have made one scrap of difference to me, because wherever I sat—on the deck of a ship or at a street cafe in Paris or Bangkok—I would be sitting under the same glass bell jar, stewing in my own sour air."" And that feeling, of feeling trapped, of sitting under a bell jar, is something that has and will resonate with women across centuries and locations. It's one of the strongest images in the entire book. Esther feels like ""the air of the bell jar wadded round me and I couldn't stir."" It's the feeling of being unable to move, unable to steer your own life down the path you want.
To the person in the bell jar, blank and stopped as a dead baby, the world itself is the bad dream.
After her release from the mental health ward, Esther asks herself: ""What was there about us, in Belsize, so different from the girls playing bridge and gossiping and studying in the college to which I would return? Those girls, too, sat under bell jars of a sort."" She realises that the bell jar is not just linked to her mental illness and depression, it's also linked to her being a woman and having certain areas of society barred from her. And she knew that even if now ""The bell jar hung, suspended, a few feet above my head. I was open to the circulating air."", she wasn’t sure ""that someday—at college, in Europe, somewhere, anywhere—the bell jar, with its stifling distortions, wouldn't descend again?"" There’s no escaping the bell jar, only in death. And even though I had my problems with Esther as a character and Plath as a person, it made me sad that at the end of the book, Esther “took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart. I am, I am, I am."", whereas Plath would take her own life weeks after the novel's publication. She was, she was, she was.Favorite quote: ""I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story.

72,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7355135-b0nnie,Rating 4 out of 5," The Bell Jar  is a first person narrative about one woman's total alienation - from the self, from society, from the world - with the cold war as a backdrop (the references to the the Rosenbergs, the UN, Russians). She is a sort of female 'underground man' of the new age. The story is told simply, though complex in structure and themes. Sylvia Plath writes with a clear direct style that is ironic, funny, and poetic. Esther, a young woman of the 1950s, is in New York for a brief, glamourous job at a magazine. New York! the centre of the world, the jazz and push of New York, the dark heart of New York. Clothes and parties and men. Esther finds no excitement in this: her mind is on the Rosenbergs, and ""being burned alive all along your nerves."" She feels empty. It is a crisis of identity, but of course it is more than that. Her sense is that society has placed her under a bell jar, where she is stifled and unable to act.Magazines, the media of the day, had a large influence on women and their self image. On the one hand, they showed how exiting life could be with a career and travel. Yet they also sanctified motherhood and the good wife. Esther uses an allegory to show how this type of doublethink fragments and paralyzes her :  From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.The moment of total alienation comes when she crawls into the underground - a dark gap in a cellar - to take her own life. From this lowest point she is rescued and brought to recovery, and again able to listen to the old brag of her heart, ""I am, I am, I am"". She can breathe and live. The bell jar is lifted, at least for a time."

To lie in the soft brown earth, with the grasses waving above one’s head, and listen to silence. To have no yesterday, and no tomorrow. To forget time, to forgive life, to be at peace.as puts Plath: The one pure sensation that one gets after reading words that hurt like hell, is of apology maybe, Sylvia must have been in innermost pain to inscribe her feelings on paper, Bell Jar might not be structurally flawless, it has its imperfections all the same, her protagonist is only twenty and is supposed to have the time of her life, the striking resemblance of Esther Greenwood with Sylvia is undoubtable.“I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet”Plath has stripped her emotions bare for blind world to view, isn’t it very apprehensive for a being to show places of such sheer darkness and weakness to lay open for world to see. And yet, how brave;. She molds them, carves something too refined and remarkable out of them, her own thoughts overpower her, make her defenseless and she roars, roars in agony of her own creation. The hell of her thoughts that led her to madness and then a mindless death.At twenty I tried to dieAnd get back, back, back to you.I thought even the bones would do.But they pulled me out of the sack, And they stuck me together with glue.I felt like a culprit for some sin unknown to me, throughout the journey along her, Sylvia Plath's death haunts every page as despair vanquishes life, “The silence depressed me. It wasn't the silence of silence. It was my own silence” she could’ve been saved, if only there had been a listener to her heart’s miseries, she could’ve lived longer only if there had been someone to seize her obstinately from that leapt she fated for herself!"

This book is relatable to those who have experienced/experience depression and feelings of not knowing what to do- feeling lost, inadequate and defeated. This book was poignant and emotive through describing facets and experiences of depression. It describes the descending of mental illness, particularly that of depression, in a young woman. Esther Greenwood is a promising scholarship student with a lavish life and opportunities in New York City, however, she feels restless with this and not fulfilled... she doesn’t quite know what is wrong with her but she knows it’s something. Through Esther’s thoughts and experiences you are witness to a young woman descent into a spiral of depression and suicidal ideation, which leads her to “odd” behaviours. Through this book the reader is able to see the different forms of treatment Esther undergoes (like ECT) and different treatment facilities, and how these experiences are unique and how these places and treatments differ from one another. This is an important book as it describes how multifaceted mental illness can be and how unique it is to an individual. Plath does an excellent and realistic description of what living with depression is like, and how it’s always hovering over you (like the Bell Jar description) despite having “good days”. This is a hard book to separate from Plath’s own life, who committed suicide a few weeks before publication, and is a semi-biographical account of events that occurred during her life time. From Wagner-Martin (1988) Biographical Note- ”What I’ve done is throw together events from my own life, fictionalising to add colour... but I think it will show how isolated a person feels when he is suffering a breakdown.... I’ve tried to picture my works and the people in it as seen through the distorted lens of The Bell Jar.”"

While recounting the activities of her strange new friends and blind date disasters, one in particular pertaining to a turkey neck and gizzards gave me a laugh-out-loud moment I will not forget although there's not much else in this terribly depressing novel to bring joy to the reader.This semi-autobiographical novel was first published in 1963 just before Sylvia Plath ended her incredibly sad life while her two young children slept in the next room, and vividly narrated in this story are the pre-planned details of her first suicide attempt at age 20 in 1953 resulting in an absolute miracle she was ever found alive.Inside The Bell Jar is not a place you want to be, but Sylvia Plath's convincing writing style will take you on an emotional and scary journey into the 1960's medical world of shock treatments, and give you a descriptive glimpse of the frightening darkness inside the mind of a young woman on her way to complete mental breakdown.Highly recommend this classic despite the disturbing subject matter."

From the tip of every branch,like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor..""(TBJ)Esther Greenwood's story is told in flashbacks, shifting in time as rhythmically as the rise and fall of her moods, as she narrates her young adult experiences interning for the summer at a fashion magazine in New York, where she becomes conflicted by society's expectations, and the pressures to conform to established gender roles in the 1950's. ""I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree,starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet."" (TBJ)She conforms to the acceptable ladies' attire: black patent leather shoes with matching black patent belt and handbag; she plays the acceptable dating game but remains wary of men and their 'turkey neck and turkey gizzards'. Her pristine image is destroyed like her black patent shoes - cracked and crusted, and flowing with the unstaunched rivulets of a virgin's sacrifice: the blood jet is poetry/ There is no stopping it (K). She is lost trying to sculpt out just who she really is or what she wants, sinking beneath the waves of schizophrenia, suicidal attempts and clinical institutions where she becomes an anesthetized 'nobody' to the doctors. The laboratory jar descends, oppresses, suffocates in its perilous air, denying oxygen; flows of red transcends to black, thumping through fevered Tulips opening and closing to the beat of 'the old tattoo...I am...I am...I am.' (FL, T, SOER).  “Then something bent down and took hold of me and shook me like the end of the world. Whee-ee-ee-ee-ee, it shrilled, through an air crackling with blue light, and with each flash a great jolt drubbed me till I thought my bones would break and the sap fly out of me like a split plant.”(TBJ)The Bell Jar is Plath's 'I' novel confession of her personal and emotional experiences, an examination of her struggles for creative visibility and a meaningful place for herself (she needed the rich rewards of a quiet Woolf's den, perhaps). In completing TBJ, Plath gave voice to the opposing and shattered features of her personality at a time when women were still typically silent; she began to understand and like her 'self'. She seemed to have laid to rest some dark demons, and though she received high praise for her poetry collection Colossus (1960), she had hopeful aspirations for a famous literary name as a prose writer. The genius of Plath is that she has brilliantly preserved the political, the feminist, the visionary, the hopeful, the death and rebirth themes of her stunning poems - like the perfect specimen - for all to scrutinize in the eponymous Bell Jar: a compelling reason to peruse this (posthumous) Pulitzer Prize winning poetess's oeuvre.Plath was, like Esther at the end of this novel, a woman who came to terms - and learned how to live - with herself:Esther viewed the newly dug ground where lay her dark mirror image that, not too long ago, had hung above it. Lucky for her, dying was an art, like everything else - she did it exceptionally well (LL). She felt a sense of renewal, luminous in a thousand blue sparks, awakened like Lady Lazarus  - so ravenous for life she could eat men like air.So what happened between the publication of The Bell Jar on January 23, 1963 and Sylvia Plath's suicide two weeks later on Feb 11th? Biographer Linda Wagner-Martin (Sylvia Plath- A Biography, 2014) describes a progressive physical and psychological decline from the rejection of the book under her real name - presumably unable to cast off the shadow of her successful poet laureate husband, Ted Hughes - prompting her to publish under the pseudonym Victoria Lucas. She and her two young children (abandoned by the adulterous TH) were constantly ill with the flu, lonely and often isolated by terrific winter storms; as her depression worsened, she had difficulties caring for them and home, and had little energy or opportunity to write. The last poem she wrote before she died can be read as an epitaph:EdgeThe woman is perfected. Her dead Body wears the smile of accomplishment,The illusion of a Greek necessity Flows in the scrolls of her toga,Her bare Feet seem to be saying:We have come so far, it is over.Each dead child coiled, a white serpent, One at each little Pitcher of milk, now empty. She has folded Them back into her body as petalsOf a rose close when the gardenStiffens and odors bleed From the sweet, deep throats of the night flower.The moon has nothing to be sad about,Staring from her hood of bone.She is used to that sort of thing.Her blacks crackle and drag.Key:TBJ- The Bell JarFL-Face LiftK- KindnessLL- Lady LazarusT- TulipsSOER- Suicide Off Egg RockPoem mixology referenced above are in The Collected Poems- Sylvia Plath, 1981, ed.Ted Hughes"

Let me preface this review by saying that I've read ""Boy Parts"" by Eliza Clark and most of the work of Ottessa Moshfegh AND I LOVED THOSE BOOKS. Call me basic, but those are some of my favorite books of all time. In other words, I love the ""insane women"" genre. Not even my physical copies are all the same size (which I hate) so how can I even think to fit the contents of completely different books with completely different storylines in the same genre shelf? Yeah, I hate to put labels on books and the ""insane women"" narrative quite frankly drives ME insane, but here we are. You can't tell me you haven't seen The Bell Jar alongside previously mentioned books at least one time in your life, recommended as a ""female rage"" book or something of that connotation!However, call it how you want, but I like my books a tad bit crazy, and this delivered that, A LOT. And not in a good way. I mentioned my disliking of this book in the updates already, but let me try to be coherent for a second. First of all, this is not feminism, in any way. Out of 300 pages, this book had 2-3 feminist pages, rest was just pure HATRED. Can you call yourself a feminist if you bring down black people, Asian people, overweight people, mothers, students, bodies of dead people? I understand that the MC suffers from depression and that's the whole point of the book, but from what I see on the Internet, the author wasn't very different from her character, at least in that aspect. Many people think that this book was ""ahead of its time"" blablabla, BUT, honestly, it wasn't written that long ago to be this ignorant. People can have other characteristics aside from the color of their skin, and writers knew that CENTURIES ago. The story had a 3 star plot (to me) and I would rate it three stars, but I give three stars to solid books I had good time reading. This wasn't one of those. It had me closing the book (and almost throwing it across the room) every now and then. Some parts were good, and then BOOM, more racism. Thinking about that now, maybe even 2 stars is generous. The ending was also very disappointing, basically no message came across. Writing was very beautiful, Sylvia Plath has a wonderful way of describing situations and emotions, but that poetic vessel was wasted on this hot mess. I didn't write down a single thing (and writing down quotes is usually my routine)I don't want to talk about characters because there's nothing to talk about. Without being dramatic, I'm so sad that this book is THIS popular and wide-spread nowadays, and an influence to so many young women. We can be feminists without being THIS hateful, or if hatred is needed, it can be pointed to population groups that actually put us down. DO BETTER 💕"

I get that this was likely a very progressive and revolutionary entry for female mental health fiction in the 1960s, but compared to modern books on the subject this is by no means anything extraordinary or special. If anything, I mostly think it stands out for its historic value; it’s interesting to see how mental illness was treated in the 50s and 60s, and also to see what was considered as feminist back then. Although still not perfect, mental health prevention and treatment has progressed immensely, and the creepiest part about this book for me really was the casual use of electrotherapy. And the fact that this book actually makes it seem like it worked...? Yikes. I mean, it was obvious that our main character didn’t like the shock treatment, but in the end, she does get better because of that. So, the book kind of makes it seem like a necessary evil? Which, obviously, it’s not. It’s absolute bullshit. But yea, they didn’t seem to think so in the that day and age.I found it quite annoying that the feminism in this book mostly meant that our main character hated every single woman she encountered. She judged everyone and everything, but meanwhile she had no idea what she wanted either. She didn’t want to get married, but she didn’t really have the drive to become a careerwoman either... She was in limbo. She felt pushed in a lot of different directions, which eventually meant she had no passion to truly take any of those directions for herself. I suppose the book is trying to tell us that the pressures and expectations that are put on women can be very damning and can make it impossible for women to succeed. Which is a good point, but I don’t feel like the ‘hating every woman’ approach is the best way to show that.All in all, this was an okay read (for the time it was written), but I’m not a big fan or anything. It doesn’t stand out to me at all."

The Bell Jar is one such a book. In a big and meaningful way. I had tried many times to read this one and found myself either distracted, sleepy or altogether disinterested. After having it among the very first batch of books I added on GR, I totally gave up on ever reading it.Then I got hold of the audiobook narrated by Maggie Gyllenhaal and by the time the prologue was finished, it was ON.I still cannot say that I fell in love with the book but I can certainly see why it hit hard for a lot of people. I loved the New York part the best but found it floundered a bit after she got home, much like Esther herself I imagine."
81,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas,Rating 4 out of 5,"Originally published in 1963, The Bell Jar must have been revolutionary for its time. A well-educated and witty young woman by the name of Esther Greenwood descends into depression after moving to New York. Along the way, she rejects the advances of male suitors, and as she spirals further and further out of control, she lampoons society's constructions of gender as well as the use of shock therapy within the mental health system. Her narrative flows in and out of time, pushing us forward and backward amidst her struggle to stay afloat in a sea of melancholy.The Bell Jar raises questions still relevant today. It asks us to examine the intersection between feminism and psychology, such as how the confinement of women damages their mental health. Sylvia Plath provides us with a voice that is not altogether likeable, but relatable enough to sympathize and empathize with. I feel like all readers will react to Esther differently - some with indifference, some with a strong sense of solidarity, and others maybe an outward dislike. Still, I would recommend The Bell Jar to anyone interested in the subjects of feminism or psychology, because it delves into both in a time period that we might not all be familiar with."
82,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51649609-kerri,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Bell Jar first came to my attention via TV and films. I feel I can remember more than one sitcom where a character (usually a girl in high school) signified her sadness by reading The Bell Jar. Their problems were typically trivial, resolved by the end of the episode, their mental health perfectly sound. I don't think is an unfair portrayal of many people who read this book, but the laughter and eye rolls from the 'seen it all before' adults did give me a false impression of the book itself. That it was lightweight. There are people who declare they had the flu, when in reality they most likely had a cold. Certain people seem to do similar things with words like depression or phrases like panic attack. You've probably met them! They don't seem to comprehend the difference between feeling anxious in a stressful situation (which is typically healthy and normal) and having an actual anxiety disorder. They casually say they are having a panic attack, but they aren't - if they actually did have one, perhaps they would speak with a touch more care. Anyway, that's the type of person* I associated this book with. But while it may be popular with a reader who merely has a cold, the book is definitely influenza. I found it a strange book to read. I related to it in many, many ways, even though so much of doesn't fit with my actual experience of my own mind. Perhaps that is why it has resonated with so many people over such a long period of time -- you can find familiar parts of yourself or it articulates something you have felt but hadn't known how to express. This may also be why many people actively dislike it, but that's just a theory! What's especially interesting (and sad) about it is I think that for the most part, it is still so relevant. The doctor might not smoke in your hospital room anymore, and there are more treatment options available, but so much of felt like it could have been written recently, especially the emotional side of it. I thought a lot about this review and ultimately struggled with what exactly to say. It's such a known book that there seems little point in typing out yet another review! I would suggest thinking carefully about reading it if you are currently working through mental health issues, though I also think each person is different. What some might find triggering, another might find cathartic. *Also, I just wanted to note that I am aware that depression etc is complex, that some people are able to function seemingly as normal with it, so appear fine etc. I'm more referring to that melodramatic but very surface type of thing that is usually temporary and easily resolved. Still, as this book makes clear, it isn't always as trivial as it may seem. ---I'm leaving this earlier note here at the end of the review, since it was my initial reaction.---I will probably attempt to write a review later this evening. Usually I write my reviews fairly quickly after finishing the book, to capture my immediate thoughts. I don't over think it or spend too much time on them, otherwise they could all to easily end up taking up large chunks of my reading time! But I'm not sure what to say about this one just yet."

My Pinterest board has recently been covered with her quotes, and I even bought a copy of her unabridged journals following a recommendation from @yleniareads That’s not to say I didn’t enjoy The Bell Jar, I really really liked it, it just wasn’t as life-changing as I had perhaps anticipated.I resonated with Esther in a lot of ways - I lost my father at a young age and, without sounding entirely egotistical, I also have achieved a lot of academic success in my life, which ultimately leads to me expecting more and more, afraid of failure. The expectations I place upon myself are high, and my mental health will suffer when things don’t go as planned. So it was easy for me to relate to some of the feelings Esther has. And that’s always nice when we read!Plath’s description of the bell jar itself is genius - that our protagonist feels suffocated, as if she has been placed under one. And every now and again she has moments of clarity, when the bell jar is lifted. Of course there are a lot of parallels between Plath and Esther, and I found it hard to dissociate the two at times. Reading this knowing Plath’s fate is almost uncomfortable, it feels as though you are reading her diary. It just made me feel sad at times :(It’s a beautifully written book, sprinkled with little moments of dark humour. Some parts were less intriguing or interesting than others. I probably preferred the second half over the first, where we really witness Esther at rock bottom.Overall, I may not have absolutely adored it, but the memorable quotes and imagery will prevail. I’m glad it has introduced me to the talent that was Sylvia Plath. 4 stars."

That whatever we touch it’ll turn into gold, that we can change the world. And then … life just happens to us. They say about this book as a feminist manifesto. I understand why but completely do not care about this tag. The only thing I'm interested in is Esther and her desperate fight for remaining on surface, her attempt to get out of bell jar. I can easily see her when dressed up with her best clothes attends to trendy places trying to gain some of the glamour of New York. I see her gradually unstucking from reality, losing her courage and self-confidence to final breakdown. I see her bleak odyssey through hospitals undergoing treatment.I second her struggles because I can understand her fear. Fear of unwanted pregnancy, boring marriage, unexpected motherhood, get stuck in a small town with tedious job. I understand her fear of life because every morning I repeat to myself, and can imagine others doing the same, into the battle. Because I understand how hard it is to face up to these expectations to be a good daughter, student, mother, wife. Because I understand the need to be someone else though we only just have an inkling of whom what significantly describes the scene of the dream of a fig tree.Maybe this novel is not especially innovative but tragic fate of the author strongly affected it .  How did I know that someday - at college, in Europe, somewhere, anywhere - the bell jar, with its stifling distortions, wouldn't descend again ?  Exactly, how should we know ? That’s why I keep my finger crossed for every Esther of this world."

Sylvia Plath understood first hand when it came to how people feel under the pressure from the society. Plath is intensively expressive in her novel and wishes to show the reader the torment she and others like her have gone through. Plath did not hold back when she wrote her novel The Bell Jar but instead let every emotion flow from her soul onto the pages. Her own experiences and every obstacle she faced gave her the voice to write such an accurate view of her character's feelings. A great deal of novel concerns the expectations that others have for Esther with regards to behaviour and her future, as well as the expectation that Esther has for others. Esther feels that people around her are causing her to break down, she decides that if she was untouched and confined, she would be normal again. Isn't that's how we feel most of the time?"

89,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1762033-elizabeth,Rating 1 out of 5,"This book thoroughly confused me. It started off great! It grabbed me right away - I loved that Esther was living in New York and it seemed all lovely and glamorous. I read half of the book in almost one sitting. It was at this halfway point that things got weird. She went home to her mother and quite suddenly she was receiving shock therapy. Soon after that she was trying to kill herself and then she was in an asylum! I understood that in New York she hadn't had any good friends and she was unsure of what she wanted to do with her life, but there were no signs of depression. The Bell Jar reads like two different books; one without an ending and one without a beginning. And once the second book started it became very dull and dreadfully depressing. I had to stop reading for a bit so I could get away from the terrible feeling that was seeping into my skin. I could not understand why Esther had even started seeing a psychiatrist, let alone why she was put in an insane asylum. She seemed to be bored of her own depression. Like she couldn't even bother to kill herself because she was so indecisive about how to do it and the time never seemed to be right. And then there's this ridiculous moment where she feels she absolutely needs to lose her virginity and it's like, wait, what? Like she put her mental health problems on hold for a minute so she could get her cherry popped. And boy did it ever pop. She bleeds so much she has to go the hospital and the doctor says ""I can fix that"" and suddenly she's back at the asylum and we never really find out what happened. I'm not really sure if the lack of detail was supposed to symbolize her mind going, but it just became rather annoying for me. It's not that I disliked Esther, I just was very bored and confused by her. I finished the book and felt like I had wasted the past two days of my life. There isn't anything to take away from this book but dissatisfaction and a bad feeling."

Solo puedo afirmar que leer este libro fue simplemente maravilloso.•🦋I took a feel breath and listen to the old brag of my heart. I am I am I am.🦋•título: The bell jar autor: Sylvia Plath género: ficción autobiográficaaño: 1963puntuación: 5/5⭐️ 🦋 p o s i t i v o 🦋•Narrativa. Lo mejor de la historia es la manera en que es contada. Tener a Esther como narradora hizo que mis sentimientos se vieran fuertemente removidos. Los pensamientos de Esther eran abrumadores y angustiantes, haciendo al lector sentirse igual que ella. Lo que más me gustó fue profundizar en el significado de la falta de propósitos, ambiciones y felicidad, Sin duda alguna la narración es el elemento clave para hacer entender lo que significa tener depresión, lo que me deja ver el gran trabajo que hizo Plath a la hora de escribir la novela, ya que alcanzar ese nivel de profundidad y sentimiento no es algo fácil de lograr. Brillantemente escrito. •Desarrollo de personaje. El libro funciona porque vemos un desarrollo completo en la protagonista. Verla caer poco a poco en una insuficiencia constante es duro de seguir pero que sin embargo, hace que la novela tenga sentido, ya que al ser una persona tan errante y contradictoria, solo hay una manera en que su situación se vea finalizada, y no es una fácil. •Temas. Me encantó encontrar una gran crítica social y personal a lo largo de todo el libro. Desde el funcionamiento de una gran metrópolis, como lo es Nueva York, pasando por las desigualdades sociales y de género, hasta la deficiencia en el sistema público de salud. Es brutal la cantidad de temas que vemos reflejados en el libro, me quedo corta tan solo mencionando estos. •Final. Me sorprendió que terminara tan esperanzador, no esperaba terminar esta historia con una sonrisa en el rostro y con la necesidad de volverla a leer, pero así ocurrió y fue precioso. Sentí que valió toda la pena recorrer el camino para llegar a ese final. Muy bonito. 🦋 c o n c l u s i ó n 🦋Amé “the bell jar” con todas las letras y les puedo asegurar que se ha vuelto una de mis lecturas favoritas de la vida. Este es un libro difícil y sé que no es para todo el mundo, pero que para mi significó mucho. Soy fiel defensora que tenemos que leer todo tipo de historias y que nos libros no están en la obligación de hacernos felices, porque el mundo se compone de miles de sentimientos e historias, y no todas son sencillas. Esta es una de esas y para mi valió la pena leer cada palabra, porque a veces tenemos que leer esta clase de libros para entender mejor a las personas. Por favor lean las advertencias antes de empezar “la campaña de cristal” porque expone situaciones densas de manera explícita y puede que no todo el mundo esté preparado para leer eso. Yo lo amé genuinamente y lo recomiendo muchísimo. ~Alaska🍃"

94,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/109794023-kiran-dellimore,Rating 4 out of 5,"3.5 ⭐️ rounded up to 4 ⭐️The Bell Jar was a bit of a head scratcher for me. It was not what I had expected based on its renown in the literary canon of feminism. I experienced it as a rather depressing novel about a young woman's struggle with mental health, with only a slight undertone of feminism. What was perhaps the most disturbing, yet realistic aspect of the story was that the protagonist, Esther Greenwood, despite crying out for help on countless occasions and exhibiting clear signs of depression was not taken seriously by her mother or doctors until it was nearly too late to save her. Eerily, this is something that sadly still happens to this day even when people show clear signs of mental distress. What I enjoyed most about The Bell Jar, apart from this true-to-life unravelling of Esther's mental health was the colorful, at times poetic prose that Plath used in her description of auxilliary characters and scenes in New York and Boston, in which the narrative unfolds. However, there were a few aspects of the story which somewhat diminished my enthusiasm for The Bell Jar. I found the development of some of the male characters quite flat and one-dimensional, almost bordering on unbelievable. This may arguably be a reflection of Esther's warped state of mind linked to her depression, which is further constrained by her naivete and limited life experience. Many of the unfortunate situations she finds herself in with various men, seem to arise at least partially due to her innocence and unsophistication, as opposed to the male patriarchy and sexism. Indeed, Esther's interactions with some male characters (Marco and Prof. Irwin in particular) seemed unnatural and weakly credible. I found it perplexing that Esther, despite instinctually having misgivings about these male characters, recklessly overrode her gut instincts which ultimately led her to be exposed to harm. Another quibble that I have with The Bell Jar is Plath's use of openly racist jargon when describing various characters and also Esther's antagonistic interaction with a Black orderly when she was in hospital. Admittedly, this may reflect the pre-Civil Rights era in which The Bell Jar was written, when racial slurs were acceptable in mainstream American society. In summary, I would recommend The Bell Jar to anyone who is open-minded and interested in expanding their literary horizons. My only word of caution is that this is not a light ""happy go-lucky"" read. So, I would suggest reading The Bell Jar when you are in a suitable mood."

96,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/88305529-maria,Rating 5 out of 5,"I had known very little of Sylvia Plath but ever since last year, my friend Amna Hussain (damn goodreads for not having the friends tagging option. THANK YOU AMNA!!!) started sending me excerpts from her journals I’m looking her up. I started reading her only novel The Bell Jar but somehow couldn’t read past the very first chapter, not that it wasn’t catchy and interesting but reading about mental illness when you yourself aren’t feeling quite well isn’t a perfect match. Anyway, this year I started pilling up books on mental illness in my TBR list and The Bell Jar was the first one I added but didn’t pick it up until now. And once that I picked it up, I just couldn’t put it down. It took me three days to read it but I think I still have missed parts of it and I need to re-read it. No, I’ve read every word in it but it’s like you know when you read something and it feels so surreal, so ethereal that you want to read it again and again till it feels normal? Although I doubt I’ll feel anything but normal after reading this book.“To the person in the bell jar, blank and stopped as a dead baby, the world itself is the bad dream.”The Bell Jar is Plath’s own story. Most of it. She wrote it as her semi-autobiography from her being a literary prodigy to her descending into mental illness to the point where she was hospitalized and getting electro-shocked. And it’s not your everyday novel where the patient with mental illness magically gets better and lives happily ever after. I’m not saying that mental illness is incurable and I’m proud that so many people who are battling and defeating it. But some books and movies out there have made it look quite easy. Not our Sylvia Plath though. She writes like her pain ooze out of her and she put it on paper. It feels so real, more than real. Maybe it’s because she wasn’t making it up and she felt everything she ever wrote. I literally got shivers at scenes like the one where she stood on the roof of her hotel and flung her clothes into the darkness till she’s left with nothing but a bathrobe, when she slashed her ankle with a razor and when she went to the cellar and took those sleeping pills. I just can’t wrap my head around it.It isn’t possible for me to grasp her emotions, her misery, and helplessness as she writes:“I felt very still and very empty, the way the eye of a tornado must feel, moving dully along in the middle of the surrounding hullabaloo”“The silence depressed me. It wasn’t the silence of silence. It was my own silence.” Often she writes phrases that’d hurt your heart for her and you’d feel so much love for her, she writes like; “...to a true-blue gal who promised she would wait-- She’s the sunflower of the Sunflower State.”Her emotional state was so fragile yet she wrote novel, journals and poetry like none other could do. She loved writing, she loved reading and it broke her when she couldn’t do it anymore. God, there’s so much pain in her words that is beyond our imagination. And I just can’t shake her words out of my head. I can read her words all day and still can’t get enough. As she herself writes:“everything I had ever read about mad people stuck in my mind, while everything elseflew out.”She writes about what she was going through like, “… I told him I believed in hell, and that certain people, like me, had to live in hell before they died, to make up for missing out on it after death, since they didn’t believe in life after death, and what each person believed happened to him when he died.” “I thought how strange it had never occurred to me before that I was only purely happy until I was nine years old.”Here are some other excerpts from the book: “There must be quite a few things a hot bath won’t cure, but I don’t know many of them. Whenever I’m sad I’m going to die, or so nervous I can’t sleep, or in love with somebody I won’t be seeing for a week, I slump down just so far and then I say: “I’ll go take a hot bath.” “I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn’t make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.” “If neurotic is wanting two mutually exclusive things at one and the same time, then I’m neurotic as hell. I’ll be flying back and forth between one mutually exclusive thing and another for the rest of my days.” “The trouble was, I hated the idea of serving men in any way” “A summer calm laid its soothing hand over everything, like death.”“I took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart. I am, I am, I am.”“If neurotic is wanting two mutually exclusive things at one and the same time, then I’m neurotic as hell. I’ll be flying back and forth between one mutually exclusive thing and another for the rest of my days” There is so much more I want to write about this book but my emotions aren’t at the right place and I don’t think I’ll write the right words. I just feel so much for Sylvia Plath. Her life, her works, her suicide, everything at the moment is so overwhelming. I’ll just cry now."
97,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28854579-glenn-sumi,Rating 4 out of 5,"The Bell Jar wasn’t required reading in high school, but I believe I picked it up the summer before I went to college. I haven’t read it all the way through since, although I’ve looked at specific passages again over the years. The book tells the story of college student Esther Greenwood’s mental breakdown and recovery one summer. It’s inspired by the author’s own summer of 1953, in which she and 19 other college students worked as guest editors (all expenses paid!) at Mademoiselle magazine. After returning to her modest New England home from the whirlwind, chaotic experience, Plath fell into a depression, attempted suicide and then went to a series of mental institutions before recovering and returning to school for the second semester of her final year at Smith. Years later, of course, she would write the poems that would secure her posthumous immortality.Plath’s life, work and mystique continue to fascinate generations of new readers.What do I remember from that first reading?• The dark, sardonic humour.• The vivid poetic imagery (it’s clear Plath was a poet first, a novelist second).• The clear-eyed depiction of the constraints on women in the 1950s.• The remarkable section about the fig tree and not wanting to choose one career/life path over another. (It’s often alluded to, most recently in the Netflix series Master Of None.)• The disturbing sections in the first mental facility.• The hopeful ending, which, in retrospect (Plath committed suicide at 30), turned out to be not so sunny. • The very funny story about getting out of chemistry class in college.• The brilliant opening sentence, which besides setting the story in a specific place and historic context (summer, 1953, New York City) also suggests a lot about the narrator’s state of mind. And the electrocution is a grim foreshadowing of the electroshock therapy she’ll receive later in the book. Here it is:“It was a queer, sultry summer, the summer they electrocuted the Rosenbergs, and I didn’t know what I was doing in New York.”What didn’t I appreciate back then?• To be honest, I didn’t know what a bell jar was. Now I can see that it’s associated with other scientific images in the book, like the dead fetuses that Esther’s on-again/off-again boyfriend, Buddy Willard, shows her, and the corpse and dissection she gets to see.• I remember thinking the second half of the book felt choppy and episodic, especially after the polished and casual tone of the first half. I still believe this, but now I think it’s intentional. Plath is trying to recreate the fragmented state of Esther’s mind. • There are other things that occurred to me this time around. Esther wants to write her senior thesis on “twin images in Finnegans Wake” (although she hasn’t read Joyce’s book yet). If you look at The Bell Jar, there are lots of images of doubles/twins, alternate versions of herself that Esther rejects (Joan, who, remember, also dated Buddy Willard, and Doreen). Esther dreams of an alternate life as Elly Higginbottom. And look at the number of times Esther looks at a mirror and doesn’t recognize herself. It’s startling.• I was also aware of the various mother substitutes in the book, from Esther’s scholarship benefactress, Philomena Guinea (based on the real-life Olive Higgins Prouty), to her “pug ugly” magazine editor, Jay Cee, to the kindly physician Dr. Nolan. • I’m sure Plath is alluding to other symbolic initiation rites with the attempted rape by the “woman-hater” Marco, and the loss of Esther’s virginity, which lands her in the emergency department.• I appreciated the various types of women presented in the book, which, in a way are offered up as examples for Esther to follow or not follow. Think of the perennially pregnant Dodo Conway (is that a great name, or what?), the sly, sarcastic Southerner Doreen, the perky midwestern Betsy... Final thoughts… • Treatment of mental illness has come such a long way since the book’s posthumous publication. What a shame Plath couldn’t have benefited from some of that as a teenager and young adult. But how satisfying that we have a record of her experiences with depression. (At her lowest state, Esther can’t read or write.) • In the early parts of the book, Esther refers to her present-day life – she’s married and has a child – and I wish that had been followed through in the rest of the book. • Plath died at 30. THIRTY!!! Imagine all the books she could have written had she lived. • But let’s be grateful that she left behind this book, which, even though flawed, still captures that feeling of insecurity and uncertainty that we all have before venturing forth into adulthood.Note: for more in my re-reading series, here are reviews of To Kill A Mockingbird and Lord Of The Flies."

One day she had some sort of appointment and she drove us out to wherever it was. It was one of the few times we had snow in England, and the pavements were covered and the roads were reflecting the sunlight quite harshly. I was to stay in the car, and I distinctly remember being there for a fair amount of time, reading The Bell Jar in that silent white world; there was no one else around. The muted atmosphere lent itself to the book's quiet but monumental emotion. I was greatly moved by a lot of passages in the novel, especially considering Plath's biography and subsequent suicide not long after the book's publication. When C. returned I remember being irrationally frustrated with her wanting to talk about snow and complain about the appointment and what we were going to do for the rest of the day. Plath's work made me want to sit in silence and thoughtfulness. I have since read a lot of her poetry and think it is just as good."

Sometimes the most brilliant minds are also the most troubled, and in Plath's case, in her darkest of times, her words flowed like a river unto the paper revealing the ever so slight glimmer of her thoughts, writing through life up to the week before her death by suicide. Admittedly, I have known of The Bell Jar novel, it keeps appearing every now and then with my book friends, but I have been the most ignorant of book connoisseurs waiting way too long before giving it a try. In my streak of reading some classics, I chose this one as an audiobook on my runs and sad to say, I didn't get on with it at first. It wasn't the narration that threw me off, but I couldn't make sense of the content and where it was heading, albeit the writing was brilliant, blunt at times and an honest coming of age story of the talented, young academic Esther followed by her undoing due to mental illness. The novel takes part in the fifties and still feels very relevant today. Esther is writing columns for a paper and spending time in NY City, the place where every who of who wants is trying to make a break, hone in on talents, keep up with the glitz and glam and rub with the right sort of people. But Esther sees through all of it. She is done with shallow people but finds herself trapped over and over in the wrong crowd. She forms strong opinions about life and relationships, one might say, she is very resolute. Contemplating her own virginity and the options to be had besides men that either take advantage of her or desperately cling to her, she forms her ideas of when and how it should happen. It is brilliantly clear to her that having children is not for her. As everyone around her is experiencing and exploring permissibly, she is caught between a rock and a hard place of her mother's opinions on boys and her circle of ""friends"" activities. As the summer draws to an end, Esther does not make the cut for one of the literature classes she had hoped to take, and from there begins to isolate herself and spiral into depression. Her mother is trying to find her the help she needs and she is shuffled from one doctor to the next where she lands quickly in an asylum receiving the most horrible shock therapy as her treatment. Considering Plath's own stages of mind, which I learned from in the afterward, I would consider this characterization of Esther to be as close to the real torment as it can get, yet many chapters were left for interpretation by the reader versus spelling out the horror of darkness that took hold of her. If I was maybe a younger reader, I think I would have found myself in parts in Esther. Her resolute views on having a family life or more so the decision against it so adamantly were a stark contrast to my own when the time came, but perhaps also count as a tribute to her self awareness in sane moments compared to the depths in which she was lost and questioned everything in life. I'm not sure how I would have felt overall reading this as a young person, though it did garner a short reset of time for me as so many things are relatable and relevant still for today's young woman coming of age and I have been there once too. Suicide is a part of this novel that enters about midway and if a reader is more sensitive or struggles with themes of depression, this may not be a suitable read. It isn't graphic or horrific, I don't think that was Plath's style to write anyway, but I can see how Esther's unraveling and suicidal thoughts can stagger the effects on a person suffering already. As I finished the novel, I am ever so curious about this author's life and the parallels drawn in The Bell Jar. My overall sense is that I am glad I read this book, but there isn't a moral to be found or a solution. Perhaps I am left with a bit of sadness for both Esther and Sylvia, and just for a little while, I will carry this story in my heart, albeit a bit heavy filled with sorrow. If you have read this, feel free to share your thoughts. I know most have done so in school or former studies. I am just a curious reader who wonders what other's may have taken from this novel. Maybe someone has read it twice? Once as a student and then later again in life? How differently was the impact each time of reading?I am off to the next book, but feel free to comment :)Happy reading book friends. More of my reviews here:Through Novel Time & Distance"

Song of Chaos and Eternal Night
""To the person in the bell jar, ... the world itself is a bad dream."" S. Plath, The Bell Jar""I'm only faking when I get it rightCause I fell on Black Days.How would I knowThat this could be my fate""Soundgarden, ""Fell on Black Days,"" 1995One cannot read this novel without reading into it Sylvia Plath's tragic life. She based the novel loosely on a year or so of her life in college and as a summer intern at a NYC publishing house. In the novel, Esther Greenwood, who lost her father around 8, loses all faith in men, in her talent as a writer and in life. She attempts suicide by overdose, and the story delves into her treatment at a psychiatric facility.Sylvia Plath, like her character Ms. Greenwood in brilliance, beauty and talent, was reportedly distraught after The Bell Jar's mixed reviews. A few days before Valentine's Day, 1963, at the age of only 30, with her two toddlers in another part of the house, she took her life in a way that was most horrific. Ms. Plath's prose crackles and strikes as if she's stoking embers over Esther's allegro descent into infernal psychosis. Reading this novel, while thinking of Ms. Plath's life and the senselessness of her death, both scorches and saddens the soul. It's also a reminder of how mental illness can debilitate a person's faculties to render insane a person otherwise bright and seemingly lucky to the rest of the world, which is undoubtedly like submerging into the onyx depths of chaos in eternal night.""I sung of Chaos and Eternal Night.Taught by the heav'nly Muse to venture downThe dark descent....""J.

105,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19832827-b-the-bookaddict,Rating 4 out of 5,"A bell jar is a piece of laboratory equipment used to contain vacuum. The Bell Jar is the only novel written by the American writer and poet Sylvia Plath. The novel is semi-autobiographical, originally published under the pseudonym ""Victoria Lucas"" in 1963, with the names of places and people changed. Plath committed suicide a month after its first UK publication. Pursuant to the wishes of Plath's mother and her husband Ted Hughes, the novel was not published under Plath's name until 1967 and was not published in the United States until 1971The Bell Jar chronicles the life of a young woman’s descent into mental illness, one that mirrors that of the author’s own experiences. Like Plath, Esther Greenwood is a straight A student who faces the choice of either further studies, marriage or a career. She stumbles through, thwarting each worthwhile chance as it is presented to her. Botching the end of a month long assignment at a top NY magazine, she resolutely shuns all the college courses open to her. This begins what will be a lifelong over-analysis of self and her shortcomings. Esther feels caged by the limitations that life now offers her, feeling herself trapped inside the bell jar. Electroshock therapy follows psychiatric therapy that leaves her resolved that suicide is the answer. Platt’s own battles with life choices, mental collapse and subsequent admissions to mental institutions can be seen quite clearly in her rendition of the character. The real test of this novel is if one would read it, having no prior knowledge of Plath’s own life or her fame as a poet, and still appreciate the story simply for itself. The answer would have to be a resounding ‘yes”; The Bell Jar would stand solely on it’s own merit and still be a real success. Recommended Reading 4★"
106,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7383561-holly,Rating 4 out of 5,"I have a confession: I have never read a Sylvia Plath poem. Instead of rectifying that situation, I decided to listen to the audiobook of her novel instead. By the way, YOU SHOULD TOTALLY LISTEN TO THIS BOOK because it's narrated by Maggie Gyllenhaal and she does a fantastic job.The first half of the book is an interesting look at Esther/Sylvia's early life (because this book is very autobiographical) - she wins a lot of awards, is very successful, and navigates living temporarily in a big city for the first time for an internship. Then she returns home, and things quickly spiral downhill. I don't know what was more shocking - Esther/Sylvia's sudden onset of clinical depression or how it was ""treated"" (scarily an accurate representation of how the condition was handled at the time). This book will absolutely stick with me. I know reading a book about depression is only skimming the surface for how it must really feel to actually suffer from depression, but I feel like now I have at least a slightly better understanding of it. We may never know why some people must suffer this way when others do not, but I think reading books like this will help strip away the stigma and will develop deeper empathy for those who do have mental health afflictions.

I think of your Delia and Dolly’s Jolene, but Esther, and Sylvia writing her, as fragile and broken, good women who were overwhelmed with depression and insanity. Esther is like my Amanda, but unable to love or be loved.Dolly: Esther is complicated, we see some of her changes to be foreshadowed while in New York, but the dramatic transformations happen when we follow her back home and the subtilties of Sylvia’s writing guides us down into darkness.Kris: I love Sylvia’s writing, love how her poetry shines through in the charming similes and metaphors. I thought of other poets like Dickey and Robert Penn Warren and Paulette Jiles whose prose is made better by the verse that lives between the lines.Willy: I loved it too. The transition from fun college girl in the city to depressed and suicidal back home was for me, a stark and abrupt alteration. While I agree that there were some hints that the story would go that way, she fell fast and definite. The bell jar is a symbol of isolation and Sylvia shows Esther to be emotionally shut off from the world.Dolly: A beautiful but sad story, told with warmth and emotion, but I also smiled and even laughed sometimes, Sylvia’s droll word play was the seam that held this together and could in some regards be considered a dark comedy.(They all consider).Kris: A drama told with some humor, but I don’t know that it was a comedy.Waylon: Sylvia’s inclusion of some humor, and how she described events could also be a comedic relief, breaking up the tragedy and also both highlighting and softening the dark themes.Cash: I can see how this book has been influential in the past sixty years since its publication.Dolly: I liked Esther, felt like I knew this character and felt sorry for her and I felt terrible that Sylvia was exploring these ideas while writing. Like Jolene, she does not realize how her self destructive ways are also selfish and hurtful to those she loves. Esther can be kind, but the world is a dark place from her vantage and she cannot escape the demons that haunt her.Cash: Sylvia’s descriptions of sexuality, and of more conservative mores while also allowing for a frank and open sensuality was also both endearing and a little disconcerting die to the context.Kris: The suicidal attempts and anxiety, as well as the descriptions of her treatment also made me think of Ken Kesey’s One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, which was published a year before Plath’s book. We also see in her idea that the bell jar can descend over her again and the asylum graduates who stay there, never truly recovered, is a dark omen about Sylvia’s own recurring nightmare.Waylon: Pundits who have not read the book, or who are commenting on Sylvia’s death, will draw all kinds of odd takes, but at the end of the day, this is a beautifully written tragedy."

Me removió varios recuerdos y pensamientos de ese matiz, fue una lectura densa, pero no necesariamente en un sentido negativo. Por algún motivo, llevo un imán que atrae este tipo de lecturas amargas en momentos donde estoy en mi propio limbo. Fue mi libro soporte, mi luz y guía para atravesar ese camino neblinoso por el que transitaba al momento de leerlo. Honestamente creo que todos podemos empatizar con la protagonista, aun sin haber pasado por la depresión. Sin embargo, siento que para aquellos que la padecemos es un libro que llega y pega de una manera diferente, porque entendemos con certeza las cosas que llevan al declive a Esther. La misma Plath tuvo depresión (algunos dicen que bipolaridad también) y por eso esta novela es un poco autobiográfica, refleja mucho de su auténtico sentir. Es una lectura dura, pero necesaria."

This was alright. I like Plath's distinctive voice which is very clear hear and in her poetry but the subject matter is too much. I preferred the second half of this than the first. I found the parts when Esther was in New York almost tedious to read, it just felt disjointed. Then it turns into AHS Asylum half way through (Esther, Esther bo bester, banana fana fo festher, fee fi mo mesther, Esther!) which made for clearer reading. I wish I liked this because it is acclaimed by everyone (especially my English teacher!). Oh well. "

112,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10148904-lily,Rating 4 out of 5,"I loved this book—and I can’t even put into words why exactly that is.
“I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out.”
 Sylvia Plath gives her heroine* in this novel a very distinctive voice that notedly sets her apart from many others with a mental imbalance. There is a fragility in her words, as well as a precision to the way she arranges them, and strung together they form an immensely powerful narrative.Sylvia Plath is a poet at heart—and it shows in her writing. I was more than once struck by the almost lyrical touch her prose displays, eerily reminiscent of Lana Del Rey’s darker, more sombre, and melancholic songs, ever so reminding me of her Born to Die era aesthetic.

I don’t think this is a book that will appeal to all audiences—despite being recognised as a classic—but I was simply mesmerized.
“I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.”
*It should be noted, that The Bell Jar is a semi-autobiographical work."
113,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/80835-celeste-ng,Rating 3 out of 5,"Most people read this book as a pseudo-autobiography of Plath, and that's what it is. But it's also a mostly-decent novel about a woman unravelling under the pressures of the 1950s and slowly learning to take control of her own life, and that's moving whether it's true or not. Though Plath's writing is best in her poems, the book is spiked now and then with razor-sharp passages that make it worth reading. It would be interesting to go back in time, re-read this book before I'd ever heard of Plath, and see what I thought of it then. I suspect I'd like the book more, and so would most people. "

115,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28323108-jo-the-book-geek,Rating 4 out of 5,"I went into this novel knowingly aware of everything that happened to Sylvia Plath, and after reading this particular book, I have found this has affected me rather profoundly. Plath's prose in this is poetic and rather haunting in a way, especially knowing that Esther's thoughts, were quite often Plath's own. For me, even when Esther is freed from the bell jar, that didn't bring me much solace, as I realised rather abruptly, that this book is only part fiction. After reading The Bell Jar, especially if one hasn't had first hand experience with clinical depression itself, I think this book could help change a person's perception of that. Many still think that depression is a case of feeling a bit blue every now and again, and it is a simple case of popping a few pills to fix it. This is called ignorance, and is more or less demeaning depression outright.""I took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart. I am, I am, I am.”Plath held my attention throughout this dark read, with her alluring writing, and even though I felt pain when reading parts of this, there were also parts that made me smile, especially when Esther gave her solid descriptions in regards to what she thought of the world, as her honesty just shone through. I am so glad that I finally read this beautifully sombre read, in which Plath's death haunted every single page."

So, I'll simply leave a few thoughts. The writing is beautiful. The story is depressing. Esther is an amazingly deep and complex character. Buddy Willard is a douche. I didn't love it. I didn't hate it."
117,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11758346-basuhi,Rating 4 out of 5,"Sometimes, once in a long while, a book comes around, with words so cogitative that they bounce off the pages and hit me with pangs of echoing familiarity and intriguing strangeness. And that, The Bell Jar does. Numerous times. And it's scary that I'm relating to a potential depression victim. ( Maybe, relating is a strong word, I could understand her might be more fitting. At least, That's what I'm telling myself. )
“I wanted to crawl in between those black lines of print, the way you crawl through a fence, and go to sleep under that beautiful big green fig-tree.” 
And I want to crawl in between those black lines of print, the way you crawl through a fence, and tell Esther, that everything will be alright. Because no one ever told her that. Throughout the book, an eerie feeling that defies all logic haunted me, as if I could change the course of things. As if I was responsible for what happened (Nothing dire happened ). That's the height of perfection Plath has achieved with this book. I don't know if it's because of the rich prose replete with palpability that justifies every emotion in the spectrum or because of the intellectually crafted introspective protagonist who gives life to those thoughts.Whatever the reason may be, Sylvia Plath has presented it exquisitely in this novel with a shockingly realistic protagonist, Esther Greenwood ( maybe because it was just Plath, herself, in diaphanous disguise. )The publisher's note before the book talks about Sylvia Plath's life and how this novel is a stark parallel to her own plummet. This urged me to read more about the author. And you'd be surprised by what I found. How her life was literally chronicled in this book. And how what wasn't said here was scarier. I usually don't like a book with depression even along the sidelines because it always sounds so bogus to me. It is appalling how so many of the books seem to have reduced depression to a bunch of asinine tendencies freckled with bouts of petulance and angst with the person wading boisterously through the seas of neurotic idiosyncrasies. What they seem to forget is that it's not always a roar, it can be a whisper too. Subtle and sinuous and frightening. It's so subtle that only several pages after her dive into depression did I actually realize what had happened. The signs were there, from the very beginning, unhappiness and disinterest that gradually morphed into a lurking shadow of doubt about life itself. And I was terrified for Esther and I was terrified of her, of what she might do. Her deviated thoughts and her box full of razors. Because in my head she is real. As real as the author who created her, the same one who also suicided at the age of 30. This book's success, lies in the fact that it presents us a pre-depression Esther and a post depression one but only later do we realize that there is no fine line dividing both. And of course everything that has been described feels smotheringly real because Plath knew what she was writing about. This book made me wonder whether it's really more difficult to write down reality than it is to fabricate fiction. It's just a guess but I felt it worth mentioning because I've been thinking about it a lot. What might have gone in her head when she wrote this ? Would she have thought that some day, about half a century later, a girl in a different continent would be reading this, feeling an agonizing emptiness at the futility of her empathy ? Or was this book just a sobbing reprieve ? I don't think I've ever read more about the author than the book and now I look forward to reading her forte, confessional poetry. I highly suggest you know the story of Plath's life ( and death ) before you delve into this book. And you must read this book. "

What one is left with after finishing a book, I went through it since very beginning of The bell jar. First, the topic hits home to me. Second, it's a reflection of a true life. Third, sadly the brilliance of a burning candle finally succumbed in a bell jar, devoid of respiration, devoid of oxygen. My mind can't stop thinking numerous ways to save a life with such genius brain. Maybe she had lived long had she been a man and not a woman. Maybe if her husband, Mr Hughes had still been with her, we've had left with very rich books, enlightening and shading light on the darkest secrets of human mind along with a guide to overcome the obstacles in those dark pits of opaque bell jar. She's an inspiration all right but it'd be a great lesson and had impacted many lives practically, positively, had she made through it.The sensitive minds feel deeply than normal ones. Every thought comes to them magnified, glaring bright and living them blinded, indecisive. And being so integral and true to themselves they are left hanging in between, often failing in reality. I recall V Woolf, I recall John Nash and there's an impressive list. Unfortunately we still don't have cure for this mind trait. The intelligence is often left alone in their grooves, unable to mix in society. It has been in past, it's in presence and it seems to project so in future. Finding the conspirators around, blurred words, the sight of own clothes making one creepy- they all are intense symptoms. The falling in the endless tube, the hopelessness of life are there too. Did I see a struggle there? It's a fight, of course. But Esther did not show strong will to come out of it. She seems giving in to the urge of relief that comes with the end. I think Plath hasn't been true to herself in the book entirely. There must be thousand flip switches in mind and there must be some combination of them which keeps one hanging to dear life. For Esther, it's natural instinct of body which resists on several failed attempts of suicide, I am I am I am. But I bet Sylvia Plath couldn't come out of it without that strong will. Life is battle but for some it's war every minute. We can see the struggle of crippled to move a foot forward. But those who struggle inside mind with depression, we expect them to be normal. We fail to empathizing, to show care, love and understanding they so much are in need of.Well, I'm talking of her life rather than book but it's her life, the book, isn't it?I find Esther a girl next door, nerdy, intelligent, tender, insecure, secluded, scorned at. With her prominent prose she helps reader put on the goggles and let's us slip in her life easily. Her agony becomes our agony. The dazzling light of honesty allows us see things clearly. It must take a lot of courage to be this true, especially when it's reformatory. She doesn't ask or see it in pitiful flights. Instead her humor seems natural. Her candid description of her femininity and despair are shocking for that time. On top of that the simplicity of writing blended with her poetic prowess is stunning. You can't help but feel the suffocation of bell jar.I wish those were the final words of her, the bell jar would just shatter and splinter, never been able to close in.“All the heat and fear had purged itself. I felt surprisingly at peace. The bell jar hung, suspended, a few feet above my head. I was open to the circulating air.”"

Mi sono fermata con le quattro frecce sul bordo della carreggiata ad aspettare che il turbine di acqua e grandine si calmasse un po’.I libri che ti restano accanto dopo averli finiti sono sempre i migliori, pensavo, e guardando la violenza del vento attraverso il vetro del finestrino, per un attimo ho immaginato Esther guardare una vita che non le appartiene attraverso il vetro della sua personale campana di vetro. Fuori il tumulto degli alberi scossi dal vento, dentro il rumore assordante della grandine sul vetro. Fuori la vita che scorre in un turbinio incessante, dentro un cuore che batte e ti ricorda che esisti, “io sono, io sono, io sono”. È facilissimo entrare nei panni di Esther, capire la sua fragilità nascosta dietro una voce cinica, tagliente, ironica perfino. È facilissimo volerle bene e starle accanto mentre sprofonda nel suo inferno privato, assistere - impotenti come lei - al senno che la abbandona pian piano per far spazio ad un terrore nudo, alla “sensazione di essere ricacciata sempre più in fondo a un sacco nero senz’aria e senza fine”. Nel racconto in prima persona si coglie una voce duplice, quella matura di Esther narratrice che si guarda indietro e - ormai guarita - ricorda e racconta, e quella infantile di Esther diciannovenne, disorientata e spersa, che lotta contro l’attrito di mille forze che la spingono verso strade che la società ha già spianato per lei. Ma lei lotta con le unghie e con i denti, fino ad essere schiacciata dalla possibilità di ciò che potrebbe essere, fino a desiderare la morte piuttosto che una vita vuota e asfissiante sotto la campana di vetro. Io ho amato ogni pagina, ogni frase ed ogni parola. È un libro doloroso per la sua autenticità e per la consapevolezza che l’epilogo di Esther non si trova all’ultima pagina. Eppure per libri così soffrirei altre mille volte. #AmericanLitClub, quante perle stiamo scoprendo 🤍"
120,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2120450-julie-ehlers,Rating 5 out of 5,"Reading a biography of Sylvia Plath's summer in New York made me want to read The Bell Jar again, but I rarely reread books, and I thought it had only been about three or four years since I'd read it for the first time. Then I checked back and realized it had been over ten years. TEN years. It's not much of an exaggeration to say that just about everything that's happened in my life has happened in the past ten years. Therefore, anything with emotional import must be read again. I remember loving the book last time, and I think I loved it even more this time. Plath's depiction of depression is amazing—she puts to words things that should be impossible to put to words. The book is also an immersive experience of that particular time and the options you had (or didn't have) if you were a young woman and/or had had a mental illness (as Esther's ex-boyfriend puts it, ""I wonder who you'll marry now, Esther. Now you've been... here.""). When it's not busy being harrowing, the novel is also very funny (my favorite line: ""If there's anything I look down on, it's a man in a blue outfit.""). Plath depicts Esther very early on as an avid observer of people, and that trait comes in handy in both the absurd moments and the devastating ones.I've heard this book described as a sort of female Catcher in the Rye, but I don't really agree. I think a lot of people identify with Holden Caulfield when they're young, but if they go back to the book as adults they're more likely to just be amused, or even annoyed. I don't think the same is true of The Bell Jar. I think with The Bell Jar the qualities you admire are only going to show themselves more vividly and heartbreakingly as you grow up."

123,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6753400-gabrielle,Rating 4 out of 5,"4 and a half stars.What Esther Greenwood really wanted was to be her own person, but the world isn’t really built like that. The world is built for people who can easily fit into a few sets of molds, and those who can’t fit wander at the periphery, always feeling like they are looking in at a place they aren’t really a part of. Esther is perfectly rational in a world where logic is not what dictates people’s behaviors and societal expectations; for instance, she gets very angry when her steady admits to having had an affair while demanding she remain sexually innocent, and wants to even the score while she lives in New York for her summer internship, but she doesn’t know how. The job and the big city lifestyle do not give her the satisfaction other girls seem to get out of it, and she can’t see how her roommates’ vacuous behavior reflect in any way the idea of feminine independence she had in mind.In fact, while no one says to Esther that the best she can hope for in life is to get married to a successful man and have plenty of children, everything her mother, colleagues and doctors say and do implies as much. Her own identity is never given room to shine as it is buried under the expectation that she will eventually become a housewife. When you realize that you will always be rerouted on a road you don’t want to travel, no matter what you do, you feel trapped - and Esther only sees one way out of this trap…There were many elements of this book that resonated very strongly with me and I did not find it to be depressing; if anything, it’s a lucid and realistic exploration of depression, and of how one can feel stuck by life – and eventually disconnected from it. I am very familiar with the confusion about identity, expectations, sex, independence, purpose and sanity, and I really appreciate that Plath wrote about it in the almost matter-of-fact way she did. There’s not a hint of hysteria, self-pity or melodrama in “The Bell Jar”: just the story of how the paradoxical heavy feeling of emptiness can hit you so fast and so hard you will never have seen it coming.It’s impossible to read this without thinking of Sylvia Plath’s life, as this book is a roman à clef detailing her own experience with mental health, electroshock therapy and suicide attempts, as well as her thoughts on gender roles and the double standards she constantly ran up against. It seems absurd to call her prose poetic since she is better known for her poetry, but it really is, in a light, vivacious and often darkly funny way – even when the events take a turn for the worse. Her wit and obvious brilliance shine through her words beautifully, and it pains me to think that had she lived later (or simply had a less puritan upbringing), she would not have endured the suffering she put on the page, and ultimately surrendered to it. It is heartbreaking to know that Plath gave Esther the hopeful end she never felt she had a shot at.A quiet, introspective work about disturbing and uneasy subjects."
124,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25894509-jilly,Rating 5 out of 5,"See, that's the thing about some of these old classic books. They become so iconic that you almost feel like you are doing something wrong, or you are being too ""predictable"" if you like them.For its time, this book was a giant feminist cry, and it still bucks a little bit against the system with a protagonist that is NOT looking for love or marriage. But, I think the thing that struck me more than anything was the tragic way mental illness was treated back then. Shock treatments, insulin treatments, and lobotomies were standard care for these poor patients. It just made me feel so outraged on their behalf!Of course the patriarchal system where men controlled women's bodies in every way was also murder-inducing. From the condescending attitudes towards illness, like telling a female that her (common) complaint must be all in her head, to the barbaric way they treated childbirth, it made me wish that when I was born I could have slapped my doctor. My mother was one of those women who was left to scream alone in a labor room, then drugged in a twilight sleep just in time to be taken to a delivery room, on her back, to have a baby pulled out of her with forceps. Ugh! I can't imagine the fear and horror that the mothers must have felt, all alone, in a society that acted like giving birth was dirty or shameful.Thank God that we don't have those types of attitudes going on in our society nowadays.Okay, we still have a little bit more work to do. I'm just happy that the millennial generation females have a zero tolerance policy when it comes to male-bullshit."
125,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21992464-helene-jeppesen,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is a beautiful, however depressing book about Esther who suffers from a depression and consequently wants to commit suicide. She feels like she is living in a bell jar with no contact to the outside world, and as a reader you are being enclosed in this bell jar together with her. This was a reread for me, and once again I was very much affected by the dark and depressing mood of this book. Sometimes, it becomes too much for me and I have a sudden urge to read something light and fluffy, but at the same time that's what makes me admire this story so much - it talks to my emotions and makes me feel something. This is Sylvia Plath's only novel and it has impeccable writing in it. I don't read poetry and so I haven't read any of her poetry, but I can sense from this book that this is a woman who knows how to play with words and descriptions. Her language is beautiful, and it encaptures and enchantes the reader once and once again. However, I still have and will probably always have some kind of emotional distance to this story because of its depressing message and mood; this book doesn't make me feel happy and good about myself in the least, but at least it evokes some very unique and unexplored feelings in me and that's why it gets 4 stars from me."

127,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/91622714-rosh,No Rating,"The Bell Jar by Sylvia PlathGenre: Roman à clefHow do you rate a book that you liked and didn't like too? A book that doesn't leave you even after you turn the last page, and yet a book that you don't think you can read again? A book that is as intellectually stimulating as it is emotionally exhausting? Honest answer: I don't know.As Sylvia Plath's only published novel, The Bell Jar has been in my TBR since a long time. Especially as I'm not much into poetry, this book seemed to be a great way of knowing the troubled poet intimately. I'm glad that I waited all this time before attempting the book because I wouldn't have been able to appreciate the dark beauty of this painful story in my younger years. Esther Greenwood, the leading character of this semi-autobiographical novel masquerading as a fictional bildungsroman, is an intelligent college student with dreams of becoming a poet. After being selected for a summer internship at a women's magazine, her mind slowly start unravelling and she struggles with her identity, her place in the world and the meaning of her life. The book unveils her slow, steady descent into the dark pit of mental chaos, where everyone and everything seems hopeless and the only solution seems to be an escape from life. The bell jar is something we have all seen in our school labs, an inverted glass jar generally used to display some scientific object. For Esther, the bell jar symbolizes a kind of entrapment by her mental struggles. It's like her mind is enclosed by a bell jar. She can view the world from inside her jar, but she can't escape it. At the same time, people can view her through her bell jar but cannot touch her, and I don't mean touch in the physical sense. There is always a barrier between her and others, and she can't find a way out of this invisible cage.Considering the fact that Sylvia Plath herself struggled with psychological ailments in her adult life, there is bound to be a big question mark over how much of this book is just fiction and how much is an indication of the ghosts in her mind. Add to this the fact that she finally succeeded in her attempt to commit suicide a month after this novel was published, and you become even more uncertain of the hazy boundary between fact and fiction. But no matter what the truth of the matter is, there is no denying the fact that Plath captures the pandemonium of a suffering mind perfectly. As a reader, I just felt helpless because I could see the path of self-destruction that the protagonist was on, but I couldn't do anything about it. The Bell Jar is a book that has left me with deep thoughts and no answers. With the topic it covers, there is no way I can say that I ""enjoyed"" this book, and yet I couldn't help but continue reading it. I'm feeling as muddled as its protagonist because I'm at sixes and sevens about whether to recommend this book or not. So let me just leave this review without a rating, and without an open recommendation. It's a book not meant for everyone, but for those who do read it, it's a book that will not leave you easily. My rating: No idea.********************************************Join me on the Facebook group,

128,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13036247-diana,Rating 5 out of 5,"Sylvia Plath’s writing is beautiful. It’s no surprise she was a poet as The Bell Jar is peppered with imagery such as:“A summer calm laid it’s hand over everything, like death.” And:“I felt very still and very empty, the way the eye of a tornado must feel, moving dully along in the middle of the surrounding hullabaloo.”Esther Greenwood (part Sylvia, if you will) starts out as a seemingly ordinary young woman going through her college years but before long, you realize there is something wrong. As I was drawn deeper into Esther’s mind, I found myself reading slower, absorbing the intensity of the words. For such a short book, there is much to contemplate. Plath gives us such an intimate look inside the mind of a person suffering from depression. This book is haunting and memorable."
129,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67532575-kevin,Rating 5 out of 5,"For the first time in a long, long time, finishing a novel left me feeling genuinely sorrowful. Not because the ending was especially sad (it's not), or because I didn't want the book to end (though that is kinda true). I felt this way because I knew that Sylvia Plath left us far too soon and the world had somehow been a much better place with her in it.Her style here flows like intimate conversation. For me, The Bell Jar transcends the author/reader relationship, it felt warmly personal and private. Maybe because I knew it was a fictionalized autobiography? Or maybe because Esther, Platt's protagonist, reminded me of someone I once knew and loved? Either way, this is high on my list of favorite books."

4.5 starsI know, I know what some of you guys might be thinking right now: “four 5-star books in a row, mmm… kind of suspicious, huh?” (Or maybe I’m just exaggerating). Either way, believe it or not, each of the last three books I’ve read has been an outstanding experience, and The Bell Jar is certainly not the exception.This book is a little difficult for me to review, since its narrative and story were different from what I was expecting to read. Despite the fact that my first assumptions were completely wrong (I will explain why soon), it turned out to be a great novel, beyond my own expectations.First of all, I thought I would find, once I decided to dive into it, a depressing, quite sad story of a person who is suffering from depression, and second of all, I believed it might be quite hard to get through it due to this particular scenario. Well, I was totally wrong, because even though we have here a precise portrait of the different stages of depression, I couldn't feel real empathy for our protagonist, Esther Greenwood, who was dealing with this situation in the novel. Please, don't get me wrong, but I felt as though the narrative was 'cold' and distant from the reader – of course this was my perception and the way I felt it throughout the story. Was it a problem for me? Not at all; on the contrary, I am glad of the way the book is written, because somehow I was able to be kind of a witness, and to see these events in which our protagonist had to go through. Besides, I'm not saying you as a reader can't feel anything while you are reading this book, but speaking of my own experience, there was sometimes like a barrier between the protagonist and me, and the same case with other characters, the plot, and so on.Despite it all, I really liked Sylvia Plath's prose quite a bit: I felt as if she was writing poetry instead of a novel, since there are a lot of beautiful phrases at which you can go deeper and deeper – they are so remarkable and they could have more than one meaning; in short, it is an excellent writing style. Speaking of the plot, this was another surprise. From my point of view, there is no plot; I never saw a real plot, but a bunch of paragraphs and ideas which were not always connected among them – again, this is not supposed to be a problem once you are diving into the story. There's neither a beginning, nor an ending, since the novel pictures a part of this difficult situation in one person's life. In addition, this book is considered such as an autobiographical novel, and this is another aspect which is important to think about: this book and Sylvia Plath's life are truly connected. They are so connected that it is not possible to separate the author life from her novel.Perhaps all these things were done on purpose, perhaps the objective of Sylvia Plath was not to make us feel empathy or sad for her protagonist after all. Actually, according to her mother, her intention of writing this novel was clear and concise:“What I’ve done,” I remember her saying, “is to throw together events from my own life, fictionalizing to add color--it’s a pot boiler really, but I think it will show how isolated a person feels when he is suffering a breakdown... I’ve tried to picture my world and the people in it as seen through the distorting lens of a bell jar.”*Having said all this stuff, I must say I really enjoyed reading this book. Since I have been in the bell jar twice in my life, I really could relate to some events, thoughts and attitudes which take place in Esther's life. For instance, when she said, ""... tell me why I couldn’t sleep and why I couldn’t read and why I couldn’t eat and why everything people did seemed so silly, because they only died in the end,"" it made me think of many people who have felt the same way, made me think of myself and the moment I used to feel like that. At the end of the day, we all are trying to face our inner demons, and to come positivity back in our lives, however, when depression manifests itself in one's life, the best thing we can do is to look for help. In my experience, a person who supports you, and professional help, are important in order for you to get better. Don't give up, never.Now, I don't know if I would recommend this book to everyone after all I have said. For instance, I read it in a book club, and there were people, half of the group or so, who didn't like it. Overall we had different opinions, different conclusions and the like. So, I guess it's up to you guys; as for me, it was a good one to be remembered for a long, long time.----* This paragraph is included in the final notes of my edition."
133,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59050228-meike,Rating 5 out of 5,"Plath's only novel, published four weeks before she committed suicide, is autofiction before autofiction was a thing: Confessional literature, in this case focusing on a writer who suffers from depression or, judging from the mood changes, even bipolar disorder. The author's 19-year-old alter ego Esther Greenwood at one point even decides to write a novel about herself, with a protagonist whose name also has six letters (like, hm, Sylvia). The main plotline goes like this though: Esther, a working class undergrad English major, does an internship in NY for ""Ladies' Day"" magazine (real life equivalent: Mademoiselle). Her co-workers represent the two urges she is torn between: Wild and free Doreen, and pious, held-back Betsy. They relate to the famous fig tree story, which is included later in the story and stands as a metaphor for Esther's destructive indecisiveness. In flashbacks, Esther thinks of her fiancé Buddy, a somewhat typical 1950's dude, plus she has several encounters with men we would today call problematic. Back at home, she learns she has not been accepted into a writing course, which shakes her confidence and self-image, as they are mainly defined by academic endeavors. Esther gets so depressed that her mom sends her to see a psychiatrist, which marks her entrance in the mental health system. At the same time, Esther ponders gender relations and struggles to find a direction in life.While everybody and their mother throws this together with The Catcher in the Rye, I think there's another suicidal depressive who was undergoing traumatizing electroshock therapy and wrote about his illness whose work should come to mind here: David Foster Wallace. His poetic essay The Planet Trillaphon as It Stands in Relation to the Bad Thing is in some ways the male perspective on suffocating under a bell jar. The parallels are haunting. Plath is so fascinating because she defied expectations, because she was angry and fierce (just check out Ariel), because she was a proto-feminist, and because she spoke out about an illness that is now less of a taboo, but still a difficult topic. Also, her language is great."
134,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2417021-fiona-macdonald,Rating 5 out of 5,"“Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth, with the grasses waving above one’s head, and listen to silence. To have no yesterday, and no tomorrow. To forget time, to forgive life, to be at peace.” I fell head over heels with Sylvia Plath throughout this book.Knowing how much of this is autobiographical makes me desperately sad. And seeing her experiences in the psychiatric hospital showed how wrong it was to have put her there. She was so lovely, and so independent, but she didn't have a clue how big she really was and how much her work was and still is idolised today.She writes as though she can see into my soul. She understands every little nuance that I have, every thought of doubt and despair, and still she continues on. She writes with extreme wit and warmth yet utter abject fear that she is leaving herself behind and that the one thing she is striving for she will never receive.She uses her own voice to address subjects that we all think and feel, but are too scared to confront, and for that reason I love her."

This semi-autobiography depicts the life of a young girl and her dissent through a suicide attempt from a mental breakdown and then later being committed to a mental asylum. This is a very depressing tale, a scary journey a young girl takes where she describes how she struggles with every day life. A very well written novel that will stay with me."

 “‘We’ll act as if all this were a bad dream.’A bad dream.To the person in the bell jar blank and stopped as a dead baby, the world itself is the bad dream.A bad dream. I remembered everything.”
“An autobiographical work which I had to write in order to free myself from the past”, Sylvia Plath said this when told a friend about what she thought about her novel. I don’t know what else she could have said, but I personally feel that she shouldn’t have related it to being a semi-autobiographical account back then. People actually are mostly piqued by their massive interest in reading the original account of an American girl’s psychological breakdown, in the way of reading suicide incidents in newspapers. But it should be regarded more as a novel, I feel than as the slightly fictionalized form of the events of summer and autumn after Plath’s junior year.I don’t know, it’s a kind of book that made me go through an extreme dilemma: for it gets uncomfortably relatable at times while at other times it is totally irrelevant, it is an extremely lucid, easy read in the beginning whereas gets quite hard to go through at certain points. It’s as if she is more traumatized than anything by the fact that she can neither be the perfect conscientious student that she once wished to be nor the devil-may-care rebel that she found in her friend Doreen. And it’s the suspension between the two poles that destabilized her, rather grotesquely, I feel.I don’t know how to sum it all up: to put it rather straightforwardly it is a glimpse into the psyche of a major poet, and at the same time, a witty and devastating coming-of-age drama (not talking about Good Will Hunting). Ironically, instead of undergoing a positive progressive education in the ways of the world, Esther learns from her mental illness, gaining sanity over some tragic, even awkward incidents and graduates not from a college, but from an asylum. The only place where it falls a bit below my expectations is that I thought this was going to be a devastating read both emotionally and psychologically, but somehow it isn’t that hard-taxing for me as people had made it out to be. But it is very much readable and very much relatable even for a not morbidly-depressed teenager that I am. It’s not at all what I feared it to be, i.e. a bit toxic. Rather it is very much humanizing and much more shimmering with hope rather than gloomy glumness. Also kudos to her for speaking my heart out on the rather ‘awkward’ concept of: why does it matter to you if your wife’s virgin or not if you are not so yourself?It’s even more relatable than when Emily Maguire said: ""Boys are rarely told that their virginity is a gift, or indeed that their sexuality is about “giving” something to another person – lightly or not. Boys “get laid”, “get lucky”, “get some”. They “take a girl’s virginity”, “take advantage”; if they’re thoughtful, they “take their time”. Boys are not taught to think of themselves or their virginity as something to be offered up, unwrapped and enjoyed."" Plath does take her perception on a whole different level.The parallels that are drawn from reality are ambiguous as well. I took care to know as little as possible about Plath’s life before reading this, and that’s good, for there isn’t any Ted Hughes in this story. The burden of antagonism is carried by Esther as well. On an irrelevant note, I suffered the cons. of buying a novel from a thrift store here. The precious copy seems to have been owned by some pseudo-intellectual English major, hence scribbled with notes that resembled a lot from...
 “I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead;I lift my eyes and all is born again.”

137,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58296635-sidharth-vardhan,Rating 5 out of 5,"Esther is witty, humorous and clever –you might wonder why she is having problems dealing with her surroundings – well, introversion is not due to lack of abilities but due to higher sensitiveness as regards to one’s surroundings:
“ I hate saying anything to a group of people. When I talk to a group of people I always have to single out one and talk to him, and all the while I am talking I feel the others are peering at me and taking unfair advantage.

A philosopher once said something like intellect is directly proportional to aversion for noise – while I do not believe that, I will bet that he was an introvert. The kind of sensitiveness make one want to hide oneself in some quiet place away from everything. Mere solitude is not enough – it runs risk of being destroyed:

“I wanted to be where nobody I knew could ever come.”

The penultimate feeling she seemed to have before losing her mental balance was one of being struck – being struck with a poor family, being truck with a wrong neighbor, a wrong world, wrong sex:

“ A man doesn’t have a worry in the world, while I’ve got a baby hanging over my head like a big stick, to keep me in line.”

And it is consciousness of this feeling that becomes her nemises – that old Dostoveskeyian quote ‘Consiousness is a disease’. In a world requiring conformity to difficult and at times impossible, one-size-fits-all kind of standards, not only as to what one should be doing but also as to what one should be feeling…

I was supposed to be having the time of my life.

…. lying to oneself becomes the only way to survive. But those with higher consciousness will find it more difficult to lie to themselves; and so … I don’t understand the concept of bravery but I strongly believe that people who kill themselves or go mad are the ones who can no longer help being honest with themselves. Perhaps they are the only honest ones.Around the middle of the book, we see Esther coldly speculating over ways of killing herself – and she does so with a humor, which makes whole thing sadder. You must be too used to be thinking about such a sad subject to take it that lightly.

“The trouble about jumping was that if you didn't pick the right number of stories, you might still be alive when you hit bottom.”

 There was a time when I believed, foolish as I’m, that all suicides are instinctive decisions. Of course, now I know how life can be a constant choice for some people, a constant battle with an ever present and seductive imp and the actual act is but a mere coup-de-grace one brings on oneself."

The Bell Jar was written by Sylvia Plath back in 1963 and is set during the 1950s.Esther Greenwood is a young woman trying to figure out what her role is in society and goes to New York City for winning a writing contest. While in NYC, Ester is overwhelmed with the city, the other contest winners and all the questionable men she comes in contact with.As the book progresses, she can't seem to find happiness in her writing, connections or friendships.What Ester doesn't really understand is that she's battling depression and suicidal thoughts.No one during this time period knows how to battle mental health and you see that in the later part of the book.When Ester finally gets some help, you see how the mental health institutions battle depression, suicide and all other types of mental illness. And yeah, they didn't do a good job!Sure, this wasn't an easy book to read.The main character's progression into depression just keeps getting worse and worse. It's a slow and dark slide into this scary abyss.As a reader, you want Ester to find happiness, but she just can't seem to get out of her own way or questionable actions with men and friendships.Was Ester's character in this book a look into the mind and emotions of Sylvia Plath?Definitely read this one if you can handle the content and want to know that answer!

And yet at times I could really relate to Esther...to almost a scary degree, actually. Early in the book, she seems like the poster child for the so-called quarter life crisis, and (unsurprisingly) that's the part of the book where I really felt like I was over-relating to her. I actually had trouble getting through that section, and I wonder if it's because I found myself recognizing so much of it. There's one scene when she describes herself as sitting in a fig tree and wanting to pick them all, but knowing that as soon as she picks one, another will whither up and fall off. And of course, by not picking any, they all fall off. Later in the book when she's suicidal, I did (thankfully) find it more difficult to relate to her, and I found I could focus on this part of the book much better than the beginning. But that didn't necessarily increase my enjoyment of the book. It's pretty depressing material, only becoming slightly more hopeful by the end of the book. According to the special ""PS"" section in my edition, Plath intended to write a sequel that showed the world from ""the view of health"" (or something to that effect). Unfortunately she didn't quite get that far. Really, though, I don't have much to say about this book. It wasn't the best thing I'd ever read, and it wasn't the worst. It just sort of left me feeling numb, much like its narrator. 3 out of 5."

Die Geschichte rast dahin wie auf dem linken Autobahnstreifen, was in meinen Augen vor allem an zwei Besonderheiten des Buchs liegt:- Die Sprache ist frech, forsch, frotzelig. Die Geschichte um die junge Esther Greenwood, die einige Tage in New York verbringt, bis sie, nun zurück in der Heimat, allmählich ihrer Depression verfällt, ist leicht und rasch zu lesen. Um es zu bekennen: Ich hatte im Vorfeld etwas anderes erwartet, der Status einer absoluten Klassikerin ließ mich eine artifizielle Nabelschau mit vielen intelligent-komplizierten Hypotaxen erwarten. Bekommen habe ich frischen Fahrtwind bei offenem Haar; zumindest bis zum Crash.- Plath arbeitet mit einer mir neuen Art des foreshadowing. Ich möchte meiner Entdeckung gerne folgenden Namen geben: ""Der mittige, entblößte Streifen"", der an den Anfang eines Absatzes gestellt wird. Ein Absatz beginnt also zum Beispiel mit den spannenden Worten: ""Es tut weh. Ist es normal, dass es weh tut?"" und man ist sofort mittendrin in der Szene. Nun wird aber zunächst der Anfang dieser Szene beschrieben, in deren Mitte dann der Satz vom Anfang noch einmal vorkommt. Somit baut Plath immer wieder Spannung, mitunter auch ironische Brechungen auf. Mir hat dieses Verfahren gut gefallen, es hat fast etwas Filmisches: Als würde die Kamera in einer neuen Einstellung (man denke an die langen Schwarzblenden in alten Filmen) als Nahaufnahme auf einem Detail liegen, das erst allmählich in den größeren Zusammenhang gerückt wird.Allerdings verliert der mittige, entblößte Streifen durch die starke Wiederholung an Reiz, gerade weil er strukturell dominiert und dann auch etwas beliebig wirkt.Auch die Sprache wird mir in Erinnerung bleiben. Plath schreibt sehr bildreich, sie schwelgt in Metaphern, die in meinen Augen sehr stimmig wirken. Der Titel ist freilich eine davon.Bei all diesem Lob komme ich aber nicht ohne einen Verweis auf meine Irritation über die rasche Eskalation der Handlung aus. Denn was tatsächlich als ein rotzig-frecher Großstadtroman einer jungen, begabten Frau beginnt, die ihren Platz in der Gesellschaft noch nicht gefunden hat, aber dank ihres Talents und ihrer Kaltschnäuzigkeit sicher finden wird, verwandelt sich doch recht plötzlich in eine psychische Talfahrt, an deren Ende dann Suizidversuche und auch gesellschaftsanalytische Verallgemeinerungen stehen. Mir ist klar (oder ich vermute), dass gerade dieser zweite Teil zu einem Manifest der feministischen Literatur geworden ist und ich gehe auch voll mit, dass Plath die Szene der versuchten Vergewaltigung drastisch und eindrücklich schildert und dass ihre Esther unter der prüden Doppelmoral der Zeit leidet. Aber psychologisch nachvollziehbar fand ich den Prozess nicht, für mich eskalierte Esthers Selbstvernichtungswunsch allzu stufenlos. Auch die - vermutlich zumeist gefeierten - Verallgemeinerungen Esthers, ""eigentlich leben ja alle Frauen unter einer Glasglocke"", halte ich für identifikationsstiftend und für einen starken Slogan gegen eine sexistische Gesellschaft. Plausibel finde ich es aber nicht, da Esther verbal recht aggressiv ist, ihre Freundinnen wie Männer schlecht macht, ihre eigenen Schwächen durch Coolness oder Betrug kaschieren möchte und insgesamt äußerst unreif wirkt. Esthers Glasglocke ist sicher eine Spezialanfertigung. Gerade als eher unsichere und einem Ellenbogen-Individualismus verhaftete junge Frau taugt Esther dann nicht recht als Anklägerin sozialer Ungleichheit.Als literarische Figur hat mich Esther nicht komplett gepackt, den historischen Wert der Lektüre schmälert das aber unwesentlich."
142,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4876540-jonetta,Rating 5 out of 5,"Esther Greenwood is smart, I mean the kind of smart where she’s done exceptionally well in school and none of her classes represent that big of a challenge. Her goal is to become a writer and when she’s invited to join a group of young women to be guest editors for a girl’s magazine in New York City, Esther jumps at the opportunity. Unfortunately, the experience falls deeply short of so many expectations, inviting in a level of disillusionment and despair that was elevated when she was later turned down from a college summer writing program that she’d pinned her hopes upon attending. We get her first person narrative point of view of her descent into depression and mental illness. What makes this so compelling is Esther’s brilliant mind. Her thoughts sometimes seemed like a glimpse into madness but her intelligence and insights connected with me in a way that’s hard to define. I understood how her dashed hopes and dreams left her rudderless, making the world seem without luster as she had no visible view of a direction. If you’ve ever been there, you also understand how scary it can be to see it played out through someone else. I can’t remember not knowing of Sylvia Plath and this book. However, I wasn’t aware that this was semi-autographical nor that she died a couple of months after its publication, which she released under a pseudonym and only in the United Kingdom. It’s clear, at least to this reader, that Plath was inviting us into her own mind. If you’ve ever experienced clinical depression or any variation of that, you’ll recognize so much of Esther’s thoughts and feelings, uncomfortably so and the view of the psychiatric community in the early 1960s was troublesome.At the last minute, I opted to listen to the book when the audiobook became available at my library and that was a great decision because the narrator, Maggie Gyllenhaal was magnificent. This is a disturbing piece of genius that’s not easy to absorb but Esther’s wit and humor is peppered throughout her chronicle. The writing is just extraordinary, nothing like I’ve ever read and a sad reminder of the talent we lost too soon.Posted on Blue Mood Café"

She has decent looks and is in New York on a big fat scholarship. She has her whole life ahead of her. But things go downhill very quickly for Esther. Things get so bad to the point that her doctor recommends shock therapy which traumatizes the poor girl and since her spiraling even further downhill. During her steady decline she tries to commit suicide and is consequently thrown into a mental institution. And that's when things get really serious... or crazy rather 🤔This book dives into the deepest pits of our psyche. It chronicles the dark descent into psychosis. And as the main character is also the narrator we get an inside look at what's going on inside her head. It is almost maddening in itself to read the pages of this book. And it is heartbreaking to watch such a strong successful woman go down so quickly in flames. Very reminiscent of Girl, Interrupted... Or should I say Girl, Interrupted is very reminiscent of The Bell Jar since the latter was written first? The Bell Jar definitely takes place in a decade way before Girl, Interrupted did. However they ended in very much the same way.I devoured this book in one sitting but then again it's not a very large book. This was my first Sylvia Plath book and I have to say I'm glad I gave it a chance. It seems to me that people who have read this book either love it or hate it. To be honest I kind of feel indifferent about it. I didn't adore the book but I didn't loathe it either. Perhaps this is one of those classics that everybody should read once because it acts as a time capsule as well as a look into mental illness and psychosis, both of which it is written beautifully for. With that in mind I would definitely recommend reading this book at least once to take a look into are human past and what may be even more scary, I look into our own human minds."

I remember I had ridiculously long hair in those days too. But these things are not relevant. I'm not sure I'm up to reviewing the Bell Jar, much less Ariel, so instead.... here's a review of the movie SYLVIA which I hated and which has a few things to say about the Sylvia and Ted Show.A MOVIE REVIEWThe facts of the matter of Ted and Sylvia are well known, this movie presents them soberly, there are no cranky theories on offer (she may be the only American celebrity the CIA did not murder). On the surface what happened is banal, a marriage which went quickly wrong, and her left with two little kids. Happened all the time and still does. So what. But here's two Giant Poets doing what everyone else does.The genre known as the biopic tends towards the cartoon (Ah, Wilde, let me introduce you to my friend Whistler. I'm sure you'll find him most amusing... So, Oliver Cromwell, we meet at last.) and this portrait of Sylvia Plath in pre-feminist, pre-swinging 60s, pre-rock, pre-nearly everything late 1950s England, trapped like a bird in a house flying bang into the windows time and again trying painfully to escape, veers close to pure caricature.Sample dialogue :Sylvia : How was your walk?Ted: Good. I got a poem. A good one.Sylvia: I'm dried up.Ted: Cause you've got nothing to say.Sylvia: I'm no good.Ted: You make great cakes.Cue great offstage feminist moaning and gnashing. Then Ted says some useful blokeish things, like this. They're talking about writing poetry, they never talk about anything else: ""There's no secret to it, you just have to pick a subject and stick your head into it."" Sylvia retorts : ""You go out for a bike ride and come back with an epic in hexameters - I sit down to write, I get a bake sale."" A little later, on their honeymoon, they're in a dinghy rowing in the sea when Ted suddenly realises - he's out of his depth! (""the tide's dragging us out - I can't get us back in... people drown like this..."") Heavy handed metaphor? Er, let me think. Okay, I've thought - YES, I think so! And so under waves of risible dialogue like that, the movie slowly sinks whilst the captain stands bravely on deck saluting to the last - that would be Gwyneth Paltrow, who gives a fine Paltrified performance, but what can even she do? Middle aged woman to Ted after his lecture : Mr Hughes, your voice is so.... powerful.Ted : But what did you think of the words?Middle-aged woman (blankly) : ....the words?Cue Sylvia smiling ironically. Cue audience rolling eyes and nudging each other - ""I reckon there's Trouble Ahead!"" Yes, we get it. Ted's a wow with the ladies. So it seems that these big name high toned poets have relationships which turn on the tedious negotiations of sexual fidelity just like everyone. No, really. And in this grisly movie sexual and creative jealousy is given to us as the whole cause of Sylvia's misery. Her extremely disturbed adolescence is alluded to twice but never examined. So, it was ted. He done it! Just as I thought!Sylvia Plath was a prisoner - of the 1950s and its common or garden sexism, of Ted Hughes, of her own ambition, of her marriage, of her children, and she was in an almost permanent rage. The only time she captured and channelled this rage was in the six month burst of energy in late 62 and early 63 when she wrote the Ariel poems, which collectively form one of the essential documents of the 20th century. This really unnecessary film cannot illuminate what happened. It peers at the photogenic surfaces. What was Ted thinking? What about Sylvia's friends - we only see one, Al Alvarez - had she scared them off? Why did she become suicidal? I mean. depressed, okay, but suicidal? She knew she had a brilliant talent. She knew she would do great things. Was she born a suicide, as some people are born junkies? What the hell was she thinking, with her two little kids in the next room? This was no ordinary despair. Is this movie for those who haven't read Sylvia or those who have? Either group would have many complaints. Avoid the Paltrification of Sylvia Plath, read Ariel."

Timpul trece si femeia este pusa in fata unor decizii tumultoase cerandu-i-se adesea sa faca o facultate, sa se specializeze, sa-si ia o slujba, sa se casatoreasca, sa fie mama etc. si poate ca la un moment dat se trezeste ca nu poate sa faca niciunul dintre aceste lucruri, dar nici singura nu poate sa razbeasca si socul o loveste din plin iar nisipul din clepsidra ei s-a scurs...Sylvia Plath s-a remarcat mai ales prin poeziile pe care le-a scris, mai apoi prin prezentul roman. Avand o viata personala agitata, cu mariajul esuat si cu o situatie dificila, in 1963 decide sa se sinucida. In ultima vreme am citit numai carti apartinand unor autori care s-au sinucis si oarecum acest lucru ma afecteaza. Prezentul roman o are in prim plan pe Esther Greenwood, o tanara saraca dar inteligenta si descurcareata din New England. Ea reuseste sa castige o luna de 'internship' la New York in una dintre redactiile unei reviste de moda. Alaturi de alte 12 fete traieste o viata de glamour - petrecerile, orasul, oamenii superficiali si diferitii barbati pe care-i intalneste influentand-o.Dupa ce ajunge acasa ""arunca la gunoi"" bursa la un colegiu prestigios si refuza sa se casatoreasca cu Buddy Willard care va avea o cariera de medic reusita. Apoi sufera o cadere psihica si incearca sa se sinucida in toate felurile.Prima parte a romanului este foarte distractiva, limbajul este ironic, plin de umor, iar faptele amuzante si ritmul alert vor fi pe placul cititorilor. De asemenea felul de a fi si caracterul eroinei vor incanta.A doua parte a cartii va fi putin mai neplacuta, expunand starea mintala, confuzia si neputinta protagonistei. Poate ca pentru unii cititori, trecerea de la aventurile amuzante ale lui Esther la starea sa depresiva este prea brusca, cel putin asa am perceput-o eu. Am selectat doua situatii care mi s-au parut amuzante. Prima se refera la o reteta cu avocado si suna can asa: ""topeam jeleu de struguri intr-o tigaie, il amestecam cu sos frantuzesc si apoi umpleam fructul scobit cu sosul rubiniu."" Zau ca as incerca si eu dar nu cred ca gasesc jeleu de struguri iar sos frantuzesc nici atat si atunci mai bine raman la avocado-ul meu obisnuit.Cea de-a doua situatie se refera la bolul cu apa care ti se punea la dispozitie in restaurant si despre care eroina ne povesteste ca atunci cand fusese invitata odata, nu stia ce sa faca cu el, mai ales ca avea tot felul de flori in interior. Crezand ca e vorba despre o supa limpede japoneza a sorbit-o pana la ultima inghititura, cu tot cu florile crocante. In incheiere am ales mai multe citate care reflecta in mare parte personalitatea zbuciumata dar puternica a eroinei:""Si mi-am dat seama ca, indiferent de toti trandafirii si toate saruturile si de toate mesele la restaurant cu care un barbat copleseste o femeie inainte de a se insura cu ea, cand se termina slujba de cununie gandul lui tainuit era ca ea sa i se intinda sub picioare ca presul de bucatarie al doamnei Willard.""""De fapt, toate femeile in varsta pe care le-am cunoscut au vrut sa ma invete cate ceva, doar ca, dintr-odata, aveam impresia ca nu prea au ce sa ma invete.""""Misoginii erau ca zeii: invulnerabili si plini de putere. Pogorau si apoi dispareau. Nu puteai sa prinzi unul vreodata.""""Mi-am dat seama ca Marco era misogin pentru ca [...] in acea seara n-a bagat in seama pe nimeni, in afara de mine. Nu din bunatate, nici macar din curiozitate, ci pentru ca-i fusesem impartita lui ca o carte de joc dintr-un pachet de carti identice.""""Avea ceea ce nu avusese niciun barbat american pe care-l intalnise, si anume fler.""""Barbatul este o sageata spre viitor, iar femeia este locul din care pleaca sageata.""""... descoperisem ca, daca faci la masa ceva ce nu se cade cu anume aroganta, de parca ai sti perfect ca faci ce trebuie, scapi basma curata si nimeni nu-si inchipuie ca n-ai maniere sau ca esti prost-crescut. O sa creada ca esti original si foarte intelept."""

153,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/269235-dave-schaafsma,Rating 4 out of 5,"I read this with my postwar American novels class and liked it better than I had thought I would, given my memory of it as a first novel published in England under a pseudonym, many publishers turning it down as juvenile and ""overwrought"", and so on, but it was much better than I recalled. It was very difficult for me to read a book about suicidal depression as I have been a little crazy and depressed myself in the past days, and given some of the struggles one of my sons has with ""the monsters"" in his head (Re: an Eminem song popular now), so to see the schizophrenic, surreal depression so accurately and frighteningly depicted here was especially anguishing. Plath had herself by this time been hospitalized for a suicide attempt, but she used a book that was popular at the time (that I also had read) called The Snake Pit as a guide to some of the horrors of the psych hospital (where I had also worked with lifelong schizophrenics for years who had endured multiple shock treatments, and had even seen it administered once) to guide her own depiction of a psych hospital. Plath wrote this quite autobiographical novel and in the process hurt almost every single person she had ever known in the process, every single person she had depicted in her novel, and though she is harshest about herself in some ways, she creates an almost sympathetic portrait of herself.In the process of re-reading this book I also re-read Plath's amazing and raw Ariel poems, Ted Hughes' The Birthday Letters and Janet Malcolm's The Silent Woman again and most of the poetry by Plath and Hughes is much better than The Bell Jar, but there are poetic and psychic insights in The Bell Jar I think are great, in spite of the surface meanness in other parts. And in spite of what we already know about how her life ended, we get a hopeful ending to this book, which makes it all so anguishing, to see the struggle. There're also plenty of sardonic humor about a suburban growing-up-middle-class white girl life, and portraits of the NYC fifties publishing scene, that are great. This portrait of Plath is lighter than the one she paints of herself in the raw poetry, but it is really, really worth reading as a tale of growing up female and outsider in American culture then. It's in many ways a strong feminist tale of growing up female in the fifties. It's not perfect, but it's a classic, nevertheless, and haunting."

Siempre me agarra un escalofrío cuando pienso en ello. Tenía mis expectativas muy altas con esta novela y me alegra poder decir que sí que las cumplió, aunque creo que mis sentimientos son muy personales, nada objetivos. Este libro es casi autobiográfico, siendo la protagonista un álter ego de la propia autora. Incluso en la misma historia se hace referencia a esto. Por eso mismo lo considero muy interesante, porque se siente como si estuvieras leyendo el diario íntimo de una persona, o como si te lo estuvieran contando cara a cara. Su prosa es muy directa pero está llena de matices y descripciones muy hermosas. No me sorprende porque Sylvia Plath escribía mas que nada poesía. Hay ciertos pasajes que son icónicos tanto para mí como para todo el mundo y de los que nunca me voy a olvidar. Me gustó mucho que, aparte de la exploración de la salud mental, de la depresión y de las tendencias suicidas, también se hablara de el papel de la mujer y de lo que se espera de ella. Esther, por ejemplo, se podría decir que tenía todo en bandeja para poder convertirse en una persona éxitosa, y que luego se casara y tuviera hijos. Sin embargo, al verse con tantas posibilidades y no creer que era suficientemente buena en algo se estancó por completo, viéndose juzgada por todo el mundo que la consideraba un potencial desperdiciado. Tampoco estaba bien visto en esa época que una mujer se ""volviera loca"" y los procedimientos para tratar a estas personas eran horribles. Sin duda este libro es muy adelantado a su época en ese aspecto e incluso en la actualidad siento que muchas chicas jóvenes se podrían identificar con la historia.《Si la señora Guinea me hubiese regalado un billete a Europa, o un crucero para dar la vuelta al mundo, me habría dado exactamente igual, porque en cualquier sitio —en la cubierta de un barco o en una cafetería en una calle de París o de Bangkok— estaría debajo de la misma campana de cristal, fermentándome en mi propio aire malsano.》"

A pesar del potencial de una vida brillante por delante, Esther sigue desanimada y casi intimidada por el futuro. Es una mujer muy independiente y decidida en una época en la que las expectativas sociales para una mujer de su edad son muy diferentes a su forma de pensar. Esta expectativa que se deposita en ella no hace más que aumentar su desánimo en la vida y comienza a tomar forma una profunda depresión.La campana de cristal es un objeto utilizado en experimentos de física para preservar algo, ya que crea un efecto de vacío y las cosas en su interior se sellan herméticamente. La metáfora aquí es que todo lo que se coloca en el interior no se ve afectado por nada que ocurra en el exterior, al igual que los sentimientos de Esther forman una especie de trampa que la contiene. Sus sentimientos de duda y desánimo la superan y es incapaz de ver la razón y ninguna influencia externa puede cambiar eso. Esto normalmente generaría un tono extremadamente deprimente, sin embargo, Esther es un personaje sorprendentemente humorístico, aunque oscuro. ""La campana de cristal"" es en realidad un recuento de los sucesos de su pasado, por lo que, en esencia, Esther está mirando hacia atrás sobre su vida y se está dando cuenta de la ingenuidad de sus acciones.Sylvia Plath incorpora hábilmente su magnífica prosa en su primera y única novela. El estilo de escritura en sí es extremadamente inteligente y fluido con un narrador algo poco confiable. La historia no se cuenta en orden cronológico, por lo que la historia a menudo es difícil de extrapolar, pero debe recordarse después de que todo esté dicho y hecho. La vida de Esther Greenwood está destinada a ser la semi-autobiografía de la propia Sylvia Plath y si sabes algo sobre su biografía real, eso puede explicar el final críptico que nos dan.""La campana de cristal"" muestra cuán profunda puede ser la depresión y cuán fuerte puede tener un control sobre uno mismo. Creo que este libro es más una experiencia que una novela. Estamos con Esther desde la primera página hasta la última oración. En mi opinión, Sylvia Plath con su prosa es capaz de captar la desesperanza y la anhedonia que acompañan a la depresión, tan difíciles de explicar a otro ser humano. Sin embargo, lo hace sin problemas, ya que permite que los lectores sean parte de su propio dolor."

Both in content & personal readability-level, it would’ve gone right over my simpleton head!However, being a somewhat capable literary reader nowadays, I devoured this brilliantly epic bit of social-commentary-laden-wrapped-fiction in no time. Plath’s prose alone, is well-worth the investment here. “I felt very still and empty, the way the eye of a tornado must feel, moving dully along in the middle of the surrounding hullabaloo.”The thing I found most astonishing whilst absorbing this classic, was how modernised it felt. Sure I knew it was socially relevant today, but the style & the characters inner-dialogue, are so intrinsically well formed, sharp and alluring that it often felt like I was reading something from the NEW FICTION section of my local bookshop.I mean, just READ this:“I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.”Enough said.So if you’re unsure about this one, don’t be — as you can see above.. Come for the prose — there is absolutely no adult-demographic that this won’t offer at least an ephemeral feeling of literary-effusion 🔥"

And it was painfully obvious that the material was dated. I just couldn't relate to Esther at all. And her ""descent into madness"" was too subtle, while painfully, excruciatingly dull, and quite unbelievable. Also, I could care less if The Bell Jar was a semi-autobiography for Ms. Plath; I was bored out of my mind & the ending was just as ambiguous as everything else in this book. I hated Esther. Her white, middle class, privileged-suburban-life ""woes"" seemed petty. Also, her hatred for men was completely uncalled for. She was bitter, nasty, pathetic & ungrateful. Somehow, I doubt lower-class minorities living in America during her time would've been ""depressed"" or suicidal if they were in her shoes. So yeah, I guess she was crazy. I just don't get it. What the hell triggered her supposed descent into madness? Her 'scholarship' status? Her straight As? Her virginity/pride? Buddy's fling in the summer? Her honors courses? Her cool job at the magazine? Whether it'd been a culmination of these reasons, or none of these reasons, I sure as hell didn't know. Total waste of time. Lastly, I can attest to Plath's ""credibility"" and ability as a writer. Her prose is clear, distinct, and practiced; but it's too safe, dull, and a total snooze fest. I completely missed the plot for The Bell Jar. And if there was one, I don't want to know. Not anymore, anyway. Sorry."

164,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12933866-edward,Rating 5 out of 5,"There are certain perennial problems associated with adolescents graduating to adulthood: how to align one's aspirations with the expectations of society; how to take control and define oneself anew, when the entirety of one's life has been held in the sway of parental and academic authority. When a person remains within the familiar confines of school and family life, these questions are safely contained, rendered benign by their abstractness. But when that person is freed; when the invisible bell jar is lifted for the first time and they are exposed - as Esther was during her time in New York City - one is forced to confront the realities of the world. Esther is of a certain type for whom this confrontation is particularly difficult. Having been allowed only a narrow window into the world, she was certain of the constancy of her desires and aspirations though never having been granted the space to really explore herself. Despite the privileges of her upbringing and education, she is stifled by society, repressed sexually, and expected to discard her ambitions and adopt those of society: to become a loving wife to a handsome and successful husband, and a mother to a litter of children. During her stay in New York her emotional foundation collapses, and she is left to release pieces of herself, as the contents of her wardrobe, to wheresoever the wind may carry them. She has lost all ambition, and she discards the conventions of society. She drifts from institution to institution, and in her detachment acquiesces to her confinement and her treatments, with her mother all the while imploring her to just be normal again and to fit in, as if it were that simple.What makes Ether's decline so compelling is its complete logic, and her eminent reasonableness and cogency of thought throughout the ordeal. Despite being technically insane, she acts rationally within the framework of her experience. Her dereliction of agency may not be productive, but it is understandable and it is difficult not to be sympathetic. Had she lived in a later time, Esther (and I suppose Sylvia Plath herself) may have found in the world a freedom that did not exist in their own time. Perhaps this freedom would have been enough to allow them each to follow a different path. I hope so. I'd like to think that minds are not simply healthy or sick, but that progress can be made and that people can change and that there is hope."

166,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4063483-beth,Rating 4 out of 5,"I don't know.I can enjoy the bleakest of books. Living Dead Girl, for example, is one of the most brutal, unforgiving books I've ever read, and yet I still managed to find a kind of small, sick enjoyment - presumably in flipping the pages in a frenzy, panicking, never knowing what was going to happen next and not being sure if I wanted to know. I am using Living Dead Girl as an example because it's truly one of those helpless books, where a happy ending is just not possible.The Bell Jar is like that but, then again, not. It involved me. It involved me in the worst possible way. While reading it, I felt like I was being slowly dragged under tepid water. There is a heavy inevitability to all that happens to Esther. I began to feel depressed myself, to be affected by Esther's ""what's the point?"" attitude towards everything. While I am immensely sympathetic to people who suffer from depression, I also think that depression is one of the worst emotions in the world. I hate any kind of involvement in that feeling whatsoever. In spite of Plath's talent, I began to hate reading The Bell Jar. Yet I couldn't stop.Maybe this book should get five stars. Maybe it deserves them. But I can't bring myself to give them. There was no relish in The Bell Jar. There was no enjoyment. That is obviously the point -- Esther is seriously depressed and mentally ill, but still, Plath's depiction of her mental illness was so palpable that I couldn't see a light at the end of the tunnel, even when the quite hopeful ending rolled around. I could write a lot of standard critiques, like ""the characters were unlikeable"", but I only feel that unlikeability truly counts if we're supposed to sympathise with and love the characters. Obviously not Plath's intention. There were ""no driving questions"" - true, because it was all to mirror Esther's increasingly lifeless and hopeless outlook.Brief rant: however, I cannot see why this book is called a 'feminist' text. Why, because it revolves around an intellectual woman who isn't sure about getting married and having a family? Seriously, those are the only two components of Esther's character that I could really call 'feminist.' Maybe I have a skewed view of feminism, but to me, a feminist text is one that celebrates or depicts female triumph, success or, failing that, strength. To me, even the bleakest of books can be feminist if they revolve around a woman's strength (the movie Volver is my favourite example of this.) Yes, Sylvia Plath depicts the hypocrisy and incomprehension of men, particularly through Esther's first doctor, to the point where the novel borders on misandry; however, Esther also has a dislike of all people (with the exception of Dr. Nolan, who might be one of my favourite supporting characters ever), which makes it difficult to see this, and Esther's determination not to help herself, although I am well aware that this was probably a feature of Esther's depression and she should not be blamed for it, does undermine the whole ""one woman against a corrupt and brutal system"" conflict that feminists seem to play out. Also, to me, The Bell Jar is a novel about one woman's fundamental weaknesses and failures. Is it called feminist because it dealt with a very taboo subject? Granted, Plath/Esther (the two blur for me, since The Bell Jar is so blatantly autobiographical) has a horrible time in her first round of the much-reviled electroshock therapy, but her condition seems to improve after the first round. There's no real scathing take on mental institutions here. This isn't a novel about feminism. This is a novel about a woman. And there is nothing wrong with that. Four stars for excellent execution.

How did I know that someday―at college, in Europe, somewhere, anywhere―the bell jar, with its stifling distortions, wouldn't descend again?”“To the person in the bell jar, blank and stopped as a dead baby, the world itself is a bad dream.” The main character, Esther Greenwood’s descent into depression and eventual nervous breakdown is made even more tragic by the author’s suicide in 1963. That makes her insights into Esther even more poignant. In ‘The Bell Jar’ after entering a fashion magazine contest, Esther wins, along with eleven other girls, a month in New York. The girls attend parties and are feted, all while writing articles on a deadline. Suddenly the world is tumultuous for Esther, and not in a good way. The Rosenbergs are dominating the news and Esther’s thoughts. ‘The Bell Jar’ descends and Esther feels numb, empty, while her friends are excited and experiencing new adventures with enthusiasm. As the book progresses, Esther has a lot of anxiety about losing her virginity (it needs to be done), children (a maybe boyfriend, Buddy Willard, shows her babies preserved in glass bottles and she observes a childbirth including an episiotomy), and her direction in life (she seems to have lost hers). Plath plots Esther’s descent in a precise cocktail of paranoia and suicidal ideations. It is unnerving to read of two suicide attempts in one day, but in which her body thwarts her manuvers . There are moments of lightness and hilarity, and prose that is poetic. I listened to the audiobook narrated by Maggie Gyllenhaal, and I thought her voice suited the character perfectly. Esther comes across as both an old soul and incredibly immature, but always edgy, smart, many times with a caustic wit. I can understand why “The Bell Jar” has become an American classic. Women can be put in their place (whatever that is) by someone describing them as neurotic. Esther thinks, “If neurotic is wanting two mutually exclusive things at one and the same time, then I’m neurotic as hell.” Esther thinks “I never want to get married,” and “the trouble was, I hated the idea of serving men in any way. I wanted to dictate my own thrilling letters.” How freeing is that? And why shouldn’t Esther? And why shouldn’t we?"
168,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/764075-andy,Rating 1 out of 5,"The Bell Jar is a novel that has two parts: the first part concerns a career girl striking out in the big city for a fashion magazine. The second half details her mental breakdown and consequent admission into several sanitariums. The novel is legendary among many and considered a modern women’s classic. I’m pretty absent from that camp; in fact I don’t even think it’s a terribly well written book. Part 1 where our hero Esther Greenwood tries to take Manhattan by storm is a fairly dull account of her working for a fashion magazine, a career that should be pretty exciting (especially in 1963), but Sylvia Plath chooses to describe luncheon after luncheon, lovingly describing the grotesque food Esther and her friends gorge on. There’s virtually no mention of fashion whatsoever. Another popular topic is how disgusting all men are, either geeky spineless jellyfish or debonair, rich boys proffering jewels with date rape on their minds. There are tens of thousands of boys in Manhattan and these were the only types she could hook up with? Loser.Part 2 has our hero experiencing her breakdown after losing her job and tossing her clothes over the balcony of her posh dorm apartment. Her breakdown actually happens abruptly with virtually no real rhyme or reason. Her motivation for suicide has no real initiative other than the fact that she had writers block. Welcome to the literary world, Princess. Although she licks her wounds back in her hamlet of Connecticut all of her friends still accept her and even invite her to still hang out with them, which she promptly refuses. She’s not crazy, she’s just a bitch.And a racist bitch at that. Every simile used to describe her disheveled appearance employs ethnic groups, i.e. “I looked like an old Chinese woman”, “I looked in the mirror and saw a fat Indian lady”. Plath’s Caucasian snobbery would make George Orwell and Ernest Hemingway blush. Considering the overindulgence and obnoxious sense of privilege Esther Greenwood had the whole book should make me blush. The best thing to do would be to throw it away."

Too many painful books in a row for me. I am definitely due for a lighter read. For such a classic novel, it still feels as though the twists and turns of Esther's mind are just as relevant today as they were in the 1960s when this was initially published. It is nearly impossible not to feel empathetic toward Esther throughout the pages. Still, sometimes, the writing method can lead to confusion and needing to go back and re-read specific passages as I feel I missed something. I genuinely think Plath did this purposely, though.Solid 4 Stars"
170,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2156200-k-d-absolutely,Rating 2 out of 5,"This book did not grip me the way I expected it would. Had I read this when I was younger or when I have not yet read other descent-to-madness books, I would have appreciated it more. Topping the list for me in this kind of sub-genre is Elias Canetti's Auto-da-Fé (4 stars) with a male protagonist or Jean Rhys' Good Morning, Midnight (3 stars) with a female protagonist. I am not an expert on literature because I am a mere reader but I think The Bell Jar is inferior in imparting the exact mood that is an important ingredient in this kind of story.Esther Greenwood (Sylvia Plath since this is a semi-autobio) is a 21-y/o lady from Boston who hates his mother. She wins a summer internship at a popular magazine in New York. Her mother sends her a write up on how she can protect her virginity. Since she resents her mother (we don't know why), she goes around looking for a man to deflower her. She does not find one (right away, though) so she becomes lonely. While she is in New York another opportunity (Harvard scholarship in Plath's real life) comes in and she applies. But she is turned down. So, she becomes lonelier and starts contemplating suicide.I will not tell you the rest of the story because that would be too much of a spoiler. Although I have a feeling that more than half of my GR foreigner friends have already read this thin and easy-to-read book. For me this is just about a young woman who is sick in the head and we have this book because she has a knack on writing. Take one of those and we don't have this book.Plath, better known as a good poet, incorporates many heart-tugging poetic lines like ""The silence depressed me. It wasn't the silence of silence. It was my own silence"" but I thought they were too few to effect the right mood. I guess it's is also because Esther (Plath) tells you directly that she is sad rather than not talking at all but you feel sad for her. That's what I appreciated that Jean Rhys's work (the female protagonist there just wanders around the hotel alone and you can feel her loneliness) more or even Carson McCuller's masterpiece: The Heart is a Lonely Hunter (4 stars) that for me is still the saddest book of them all. Yet, in those books, no character say outright that he/she is sad but you feel for them. While reading you are the one who becomes sad. A kind of sadness that lingers for several days.That is tricky and it is something that I think only older (having experienced more sadness in life) novelists can do. Wait...Plath was 31 when this book was published. McCullers was what? 23! Oh, maybe it should have said ""only more brilliant novelists can do.""I think many people loved this book because they take pity on what actually happened to Sylvia Plath. Reading those entries in Wiki really made me sad. However, I am reviewing this book and not Wiki. Well, for one, I think Plath did not intend to publish this. She was hesitant of its literary merit. Only those people who wanted to make money out of her misery.And that for me is even sadder."

What of the complexities of consciousness and unconsciousness, the intricacies of intellect and intelligence, of sanity and insanity, otherwise known as the mind? What can one make of the deceitfulness of the mind? ""Words, dimly familiar but twisted all awry, like faces in a funhouse mirror, fled past, leaving no impression on the glassy surface of my brain."" I don't know where to start or end my thoughts about the poignancy of this book, or how to explain its lyrical synapse and distressing penetration of the human psyche, so I'll simply condense my thoughts.It is confounding to see how Esther's mind betrays her. One moment she is hobnobbing with writers and poets, even entertaining at literary shindigs, and the next moment, she is daft: trying to stop the spiral of her mind, a writer fighting to still the pen on a page, fighting to read a sentence. 
I thought the most beautiful thing in the world must be shadow, the million moving shapes and cul-de-sacs of shadow. There was shadow in bureau drawers and closets and suitcases, and shadow under houses and trees and stones, and shadow at the back of people's eyes and smiles, and shadow, miles and miles of it, on the night side of the earth. 
Shadows: darkness or shelter - which was it to her? Read The Journals of Sylvia Plath and you'll soon realize that Esther is Sylvia and Sylvia is Esther. Hidden, within brief snapshots of this novel, are her signature poetic phrases, for Plath was a genius in binding emotion with lyric (Read Ariel -the restored version- and you see her life in verse). Plath ""told another friend that she thought of The Bell Jar 'as an autobiographical apprentice work which I had to write in order to free myself from the past.'"" Initially, she even published this book under a pseudonym, because she thought it wasn't ""serious literary work."" If only she were here to see how far it has come in literature, how far it has come in unveiling the psyche. "

I wanted to do everything once and for all and be through with it.So I finally came around to reading The Bell Jar. In a sense, this book is timeless, since Esther Greenwood's struggles with her mental health are (and probably will be as long as humans exist) very relatable.Where it loses its relevance is in its blatant racism. I lost count of how many times Plath called an array of non-white ethnicities ugly and worse.And even overlooking this gross fact, aside from the pretty prose, there was no enjoyment to be found within these pages.Plath simplifies depression as a constant low, ignoring the fluidity of the mind and the resulting fluctuating moods humans tend to find themselves in.

Where does one differentiate between the author's own experience and Esther's.The first half of the book I found most interesting, published in 1963, yet taking place in 1953, when Ms Plath would have been on summer break from University doing a placement at a magazine in NYC, when she attended Smith College otherwise.I have wanted to read this classic for a long time, Ms Plath's feminist viewpoint would have been well before its time. But the second half, regarding mental illness, the uneven treatment Esther received, was a difficult slog for me to read. Very interesting and entertaining first half, hard slog in the last half. A few interesting excerpts from the novel, the first when her supposed boyfriend asked her if she would like to see his penis, where she had never seen one before:‘Well, all right, I guess so,’ I said. I stared at Buddy while he unzipped his chino pants and took them off and laid them on a chair and then took off his underpants that were made of something like nylon fishnet. ‘They’re cool,’ he explained, ‘and my mother says they wash easily.’ Then he just stood there in front of me and I kept on staring at him. The only thing I could think of was turkey neck and turkey gizzards and I felt very depressed.The second was a description of a man from the United Nations she was meeting for the first time:OF COURSE, CONSTANTIN WAS MUCH TOO SHORT, but in his own way he was handsome, with light brown hair and dark blue eyes and a lively, challenging expression. He could almost have been an American, he was so tan and had such good teeth, but I could tell straight away that he wasn’t. He had what no American man I’ve ever met has had, and that’s intuition.The final one was when her mother suggested she needed practical skills, not just a University degree:I didn’t know shorthand either. This meant I couldn’t get a good job after college. My mother kept telling me nobody wanted a plain English major. But an English major who knew shorthand was something else again. Everybody would want her. She would be in demand among all the up-and-coming young men and she would transcribe letter after thrilling letter. The trouble was, I hated the idea of serving men in any way. I wanted to dictate my own thrilling letters.So a most interesting read for the most part, yet only enjoyed in the first half for me. 4 stars first half, 2 stars the second for a 3.5 overall, rounded up as it is a classic."

I’m aware Sylvia Path experienced severe depression in her life, which gives ‘The Bell Jar’ more credibility in the subject.I think a majority of people expect depression to derive from some traumatic event or accident, but for many it’s subtle before it descends upon the person with full force. Sylvia Path didn’t fully make it clear on what made Esther so gloomy. For me, I think Esther simply begins to question aspects of her life, and essentially, her entire existence, and founds herself unsatisfied with her present and all the types of futures which she imagines for herself. A lot people may say, ‘oh she’s so selfish. Doesn’t she know others have it worse than her?’ Sylvia Path addresses this train of thought in the book. Although Esther knew other people had it worse than her, it never soothed her depression. I think Esther simply finds her life to be hollow, meaningless, repetitive, planned out (getting married and having children). There was no sense of a solid purpose to her life. I think this strong realisation must have slowly propelled her to depression and insanity. That’s how I interpret the novel anyway. I understand that people find Esther to be quite self-centred. After all, she is a middle class, straight-A student from a good home. However, I don’t see how that leaves her out from experiencing depression. I believe depression is universal. It doesn’t have to be triggered by the loss of someone or some terrible accident or event. It can be triggered by hopelessness, uncertainty and range of other emotions. This was even apparent in Hamlet by Shakespeare, which I read recently. Although some might argue that Hamlet’s desire for suicide may stem solely from his father’s death, it is evident throughout the play that it’s the little purpose which Hamlet feels in his life that drives his depression and insanity just as much. I also like how this book doesn’t overdramatise Esther’s descent into depression and insanity like so many movies and books do with their characters. All in all, I found it very enjoyable and interesting. "

Что послужило триггером для проявления психического заболевания у героини романа? Неудачи в творчестве, непризнание публики, неполучение стипендии, необходимость постоянно быть первой и получать высшие оценки? Можно ли было предотвратить такой трагический конец? Почему вообще люди добровольно уходят из жизни? С чем они не могут справиться самостоятельно, и может ли общество и окружающие им помочь?Книга ценна тем, что она основана на реальных переживаниях реального человека, ценна, как для психиатров, психологов, так и просто людей, которые не совсем понимают, в чем проблема – это то реальное отображение проблем души (именно отображение, а не понимание, ибо сама Плат так не нашла выхода в мучившем ее состоянии, и в книге нет понимания, есть просто описание, и довольно сумбурное), здоровым это нужно, для того, чтобы понять и принять. Она поднимает проблему стигматизации людей с ментальным здоровьем. Ее героиня не хочет говорить своему ухажеру, что она лечится в клинике. Для 1950-х ее феминистские идеи о том, что место женщины не ограничивается домашним очагом, о добрачных сексуальных отношениях, были вызовом, поэтому тоже можно отметить, как достижение.Стеклянный колпак – очень удачная метафора, это не только относится к психиатрии, но и к концепции восприятия себя во взаимодействии с миром и гармонизируется с понятием «стеклянный потолок», то невидимое препятствие, которое не дает возможности расти и двигаться в полную мощь твоих сил.Сам роман довольно прост, безыскусен и даже где-то примитивен, особенно в первой части, там, где развлечения, показы мехов и прочие элементы массовой культуры и культуры потребительского общества.К сожалению, я не знала, кто такая Сильвия Плат – на постсоветском пространстве она не так популярна и известна. Большую помощь мне оказал обзор Petra https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... , за что я ей благодарна. Я нашла два варианта русского перевода стихотворения «Папуля»/»Папа», посвященное ее отцу, который имеет непозволительные метафоры."

I really found this novel a dramatic and touching read. The book follows the in depth struggle of a young woman called Esther Greenwood. Esther Greenwood, the protagonist of the story, is a mentally unstable young woman and she gradually slips into a dark depression while living in New York. She is tormented with the idea of death and tries to commit suicide, believing that death is freedom.I found the prose style deceptively simple. The novel is written using a series of flashbacks that show up parts of Esther's past which makes the reader connect very easily with this story. The Character of Esther is really well drawn and her experiences were real and meaningful.I am glad to have finally read The Bell Jar and I feel that it gave me a little perspective on mental illness that I had previously lacked.A four star read."

182,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/542037-annalisa,Rating 5 out of 5,"I really wish I had read this book back in college when I could have related so much more to Esther's character. Scenes like where she fed her clothes out to the wind or pondered moving out to Chicago with nothing but a fake identity or more than anything stood invisible in the shadows as she watched her neighbor cross her house, I could see myself (feel myself) in her at that age. If I had read this when I was in college, I would have seen myself in Esther and wondered if I had the potential to go mad. I connected to the immensity of Esther's young, somewhat selfish, poignantly observant, and fatalistically driven character. What struck me as odd and yet familiar was the almost obsessive randomness of her actions--rituals that held no emotional attachment but she followed through to attach herself to something as if it made her look normal. At one point Esther mentioned in passing something about her childhood and it felt so honest and real that I felt that she were real, or that Plath were sharing a part of herself with me. It's what makes Esther's character so three-dimensional and I don't know that I can separate Esther and Plath. I loved the eloquent description and her fabulous metaphors. I wish I had marked them because they happened in the beginning when Esther was lucid and by the end I had forgotten them. The strongest is the image of depression (or mental illness) being like looking at the world through a distorted, suffocating bell jar, very powerful. I took this route with Esther as all hope and ambition failed her and she hung all her self esteem on an acceptance letter and when that failed, she had nothing else holding her up. I could relate to that, to postponing depression to a fixed event.I was almost disappointed with the second half because I wanted to feel the madness in Esther, but it wasn't crazy, it was depression, cold, languid, mind-numbing depression. Plath stops describing the the backdrop to the scenes, stops analyzing, stops telling us how Esther feels. I felt gypped, that I had connected with Esther and then she didn't feel real to me anymore, until I realized that just like Esther quit showering and changing her clothes, she quit describing her world to me. And when she started feeling again, I knew she would be alright. I love the unknown at the end. I don't need to know what Esther does because Plath already showed me that she was seeing the world again, without the bell jar.It's a beautifully written novel. I know I love psychology and would have loved it anyway, but that part was so quiet, it was the poetic description and a very real Esther that made me like the book—or maybe the fact that I like to read about crazy people. I tried not to think about Plath committing suicide as I read the book, but it was there, not because it made the book morbidly fascinating, but because it made it raw. I can see Plath writing this novel as her own therapy with Esther as a thinly veiled version of herself. I just don't know what to do with the unemotional description of depression and the hope for recovery other than believe Plath wanted to be better, to be happy and maybe through Esther she could see that for herself even if she never got there."

A guy like Odysseus, he echoes all over the place but the echoes are all changed and weird because it's been a while. But Plath was writing recently enough, and her voice is powerful enough, that you still hear her distinctly through people like Lena Dunham or the mighty Allie Brosh. Her attitude, her bleak humor, her mannerisms have all been transmitted through and you can feel it in a sort of tangible way that's really fun to pick up on.I know the whole echo discussion gets a little wonky because it's not like Sylvia Plath isn't borrowing from Dorothy Parker, who was probably borrowing from Edith Wharton, and so on. I don't mean to imply that she's standing around being depressed all by herself. But I do think that once in a while someone comes along whose voice is so distinctive that it changes the way people talk for a while. David Foster Wallace is an example, and Sylvia Plath is another one, and this book is great."
185,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2947323-dianne,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book is very dated but is actually more interesting because of it. This story takes place 65 years ago and is a little time capsule of horrors. I’m old enough to have caught a whiff of the 50’s and suffered through the required (for girls) high school shorthand and Home Economics classes (Home Ec being the only class I ever skipped, which should tell you something about me) and sadly, I did know some older girls who went to college to “catch” husbands. For the most part, though, I’m very much a product of the 60’s and 70’s and the rise of feminism and self-determination. The very thought of being condescended to or being subservient to a man makes me bristle. This book is actually an acute and merciless portrait of a young woman’s descent into depression (the airless “bell jar” of the title) but I kept getting snagged on all of the socio-economic things going on in the periphery. We have a long way to go for sure on changing the stigma around mental illnesses, but after reading this book, I am reminded how far we have already come in those 65 years. I feel strongly that Sylvia Plath might be alive today had she had access to an appropriate diagnosis and the treatments available now for depression. It makes me sick to think about how she must have suffered.So, modern young ladies of the 21st century, read this and be amazed. The world has changed in many dark and evil ways, but it has also changed for the better. This book reminded me of that, and although it really pissed me off at times, I am so glad I read it.Oh, and by the way, this book is beautifully written. Plath is first and foremost a poet, and the writing is very strong. Esther Greenwood's narration is keenly observant and as sharp as a skewer – of course, Sylvia Plath IS Esther Greenwood, but still.I can’t say I loved it – it’s not a book to love – but it sure got under my skin. Read it and weep."

Negali tinkamai funkcionuoti, o milžinišku darbu tampa plaukų išsišukavimas, ką jau bekalbėti apie jų išsiplovimą. Kiti eina į vakarėlius. Ir ne tik į juos. Dar ir į universitetą, draugų susibūrimus, pasibuvimus su tėvais. Jie nešasi depresiją su savimi visur, kur tik eina, ją slepia už šypsenos. Ar net garsaus juoko. Gerų pažymių ir kitų pasiekimų. Jie susipažįsta su merginomis. Ar vaikinais. Ar tiesiog tais, kurie jiems įdomūs. Jie nesiskundžia apetitu (ar nesiskundžia apskritai), gal net visai neblogai miega. Nori sukurti santykius. Arba jų paniškai bijo, bet tuo pat metu baimę bando nugalėti nerdami į draugystes – romantines, platoniškas ir tokias, ant kurių tiesiog negalima užklijuoti jokios etiketės. Sylvia Plath parodo, kad depresija gali būti visokia. Ir kiek reikalinga suprasti tuos pirmuosius, tiek pat reikalinga suprasti ir tuos, kurių skausmas ne visada akivaizdus, ne visada savaime aiškus. Nes nors kančios ir neįmanoma pamatuoti, ją lengva, per lengva pražiūrėti. Ypač jei vadovaujiesi tik nuogirdomis ir stereotipais.Viena įdomiausių šios knygos dalių man tapo tai, jog Plath rašo taip, kaip žmogus rašytų sau, dienoraštyje, kurio niekas neperskaitys - nebandydama apsimesti protingesne, įdomesne, gilesne nei kad yra iš tiesų. Prieš save ir skaitytoją ji stovi nuoga – o tai tikriausiai vienintelis būdas bent kiek arčiau priartėti prie sergančiojo. Tuo pat metu autorė atskleidžia aplinkos dviveidiškumą – tariamų draugų, gydytojų, artimųjų, netgi pačios Amerikos. Nes jeigu gydome sergančiuosius tuo pačiu būdu, kuriuo žudome šalies išdavikus, tik šiek tiek sumažindami elektros srovę, apie kokią pažangą iš tiesų galime kalbėti? Plath parodo, kad dažnai sergančiajam tenka susidurti ne tik su savo paties stiklo gaubtu, slegiančiu pečius, bet ir padėti nešti naštą aplinkiniams – tiems, kurie prisidengę rūpesčiu, iš tiesų tiesiog bando išsiaiškinti kokia yra tikimybė, jog savo vardą pamatys savižudžio raštelyje. Vietoje to, kad ieškotų pagalbos, dažnas tiesiog ieško tiesos – ką padariau ne taip, kad artimasis taip kenčia? Vis dėlto, su sau įprasta, kiek ciniška šypsena, Sylvia tarp eilučių palieka atsakymą susirasti pačiam skaitytojui – ar toks klausimas kyla iš noro padėti? Suprasti? Ar tiesiog pačiam miegoti ramiau?„Stiklo gaubtu“ mėgautis sunku, tačiau perskaityti – ypač reikalinga. Ypač tiems, kurie kitose knygose apie depresiją, tokiose kaip „Prozako karta“, „Girl, Interrupted“, „Atskalūno laiškai“, „Aštrūs pjūviai“ šimtuose, tūkstančiuose kitų, jautėsi kiek atstumti – neaprašyti, nereprezentuoti, neatskleisti. Klausimų dėl to, ar „Stiklo gaubtas“ yra apie depresiją, tikriausiai nekyla absoliučiai niekam. Tačiau džiaugiuosi galėdama joje rasti šiek tiek daugiau tokios depresijos, kurią tiek metų pažįstu aš. Galbūt Sylvios sukurta Estera dažnai veidrodyje ir nuotraukose neatpažino savęs, tačiau save atpažinau aš. Ir dėl to jaučiuosi beprotiškai dėkinga."

Just too white, too privileged, doesn't know what to do with herself bored. Ironically pre-housewife housewife bummed out, as she fears will happen if she becomes a housewife. And this novel is a huge snooze fest. Other than a very minor inner/psychological conflict, nothing happens in this book. She's a great student and earns an all-expenses paid internship at a fashion magazine in fucking Manhattan, eats caviar and crab and cream cheese-filled avocados, goes to clubs, can't bring herself to just fuck someone and lose her virginity, throws all her clothes out of her hotel room window and goes to her mother's big house in Connecticut where she has a nervous breakdown and sees a therapist.

No, my issues are not with the book as a work of social record. What I am giving up on after years of trying different samples of her work is Plath's writing - it does nothing for me and I found it a bit of a tedious slog to finally finish the book based on one of the whiniest characters in history.

195,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5925762,Rating 4 out of 5,"США, 1950-ті. Після 40-х, коли чоловіки пішли на війну, й тому жінки отримали доступ до багатьох недосяжних їм доти сфер (від університетських аудиторій до заводських цехів), пішов відкат, аби звільнити ці робочі місця назад, і виникає дуже прескриптивна у порівнянні навіть з попередніми десятиліттями модель фемінності. І от на цьому тлі є головна героїня - їй 19, вона хоче стати письменницею, вона отримує особисту стипендію у престижному коледжі й виграє ""золотий квиток"" - літнє стажування при модних журналах у Нью-Йорку. Здавалося б, історія успіху, американська мрія, оце от усе. Але американська мрія ніяк не конфігурує із тими жіночими долями, які винесено на перший план у тому десятилітті, бодай для головної героїні. Для неї це або/або - або творчість, або родина, і т.д., постійно наголошується її неготовність обирати, адже будь-який вибір є відмовою від нескінченності інших альтернатив, і тому замість обрати якесь одне життя - менше, ніж множина потенційних життів, але більше, ніж небуття - вона обирає таки небуття, сповзає все глибше в депресію і спроби самогубства. (Хоча насправді не беруся робити ставки, що первинне, а що вторинне - депресія чи нездатність знайти собі нішу між прескриптивних моделей, бо жіночі історії успіху на фоні є, і то в доволі різних конфігураціях, що не виключають ворк-лайф балансу, від заміжньої редактори успішного журналу до лесбійської пари поетки й професорки). В кінці героїня нібито виходить із психлікарні, але умовність цього геппі-енду підкреслена не лише нашими позатекстовими знаннями про біографію Сильвії Плат, а й мимохідною фразою при початку, єдиною, здається, всередині тексту вказівкою на те, що розповідь ретроспективна - головна героїня бере сувенір із того стажування, яке мало стати початком її історії успіху як мисткині, і відламує від нього зірку на іграшку дитині. (Про жіночу творчість там є ще один стрьомний епізод: мати бойфренда головної героїні довго і старанно виплітає красивий килимок, але він не стає арт-об'єктом, а лягає під ноги на кухні, де його ніхто не помічає і швидко затоптують, з тим же успіхом килимок можна було купити дешево в магазині й не морочитися. Цей епізод із відламаною зіркою вказує, що творча біографія головної героїні пішла якимось таким же руслом).З одного боку, я розумію, чому у книжки культовий статус: вона однією з перших артикулює цей пласт жіночого досвіду не як ідилію, а як трагедію. І від того, як багато лишилося, mutatis mutandis, актуальним і зараз, жаскувато. Але суб'єктивно я цей роман не люблю (це вже вдруге перечитую, вперше читала років вісім тому в універі) - це все настільки близько і впізнавано, що виглядає банальним, ми з цим текстом на тій дистанції, яка не дозволяє бачити в цьому естетичний, а не документальний артефакт. А українське видання просто казкове! По-перше, дуже добрий переклад Ольги Любарської, по-друге, пекельно прекрасні ілюстрації, які створюють чимало доданої вартості (Анастасія Стефурак про оформлення книжки) - тиранія рожевеньких радісних кольорів, головна героїня як порожній силует і т.д., казково.А рецензія пера Ганни Улюри - найкраще, що я читала про цей текст."

Ali ono što i sad ječi su superiorne rečenice – jednostavne, oštre i lirski gipke i jedna jezivo ubedljiva teskoba koja poručuje da depresija nije nasilna izbezumljenost, nego gašenje. Pitanje je da li postoji išta strašnije od toga – osećaj potpunog nedostatka volje, tonjenja, besmislenosti, omašenosti. Osećaj da je neko manji od nule, utvare, ljušture. Osećaj da nema više čak da se ljušti, da se usitnjava, raščlanjuje, sve je gotovo i sve je splaslo, ravno, mučno ravno. Beznadežno je. A iako je muka beskrajna, dodatan očaj izaziva što nema čak ni anksioznosti. Život postaje privremeni i nestalni dogovor sa disanjem, koji svakom prilikom može da bude prekinut, gde ni bol ne može pomoći. Imati makar i trunčicu ovakvog raspoloženja može biti razarajuće, a onaj ko se nađe u njemu preplavljen, često i ne ispliva. I ta okolnost nije vezana samo za kontekst nečijeg života, iako je on svakako važan, već za neku unutrašnju osetljivost koja je teško objašnjiva. Preživljavali su ljudi najgore košmare, pa je ipak volja za samoodržanjem pobedila, dok su neki ljudi sa relativno povoljnim ili sasvim povoljnim životnim uslovima bili beskrajno nesrećni. Ester Grinvud nije isplivala. Silvija Plat nije isplivala.Složenost mogućih razloga potonuća čini ovu knjigu klasikom američke književnosti. Ništa, zapravo, nije moglo da bude izbegnuto, koliko god delovalo da je izlaz moguć. Trenutno mi bubnji u glavi predstavljanje tela u romanu, pogotovo ženskog tela i delikatan odnos između Ester i Badija, koji je oličenje onoga što bi se od muškarca poželeti moglo u onovremenoj Americi. A želelo se, i tada i danas, licemerje i plivanje po površini. Lepa, ugodna fasada, u kojoj vlada lom i džiklja korov. Ester je zarobljena u staklenom zvonu ne iz kakve prezaštićenosti, komfora, nego iz nemogućnosti da zaista dopre do bilo koga. I mada može zvučati prefinjeno, stakleno zvono je surovo, čvrsto i neko ko je u njemu nema kiseonika. Izolujući, gnječi.Ali nakon svega, pitanje koje se nameće je koliko „Stakleno zvono”, nakon više meseci čitanja, i dalje ječi, a koliko bih ja voleo da je to tako. Bez obzira na sve, voleo bih da verujem u gorki talog koji je ostao, kao što često nakon čitanja, kroz filter vremena, ostaju samo neodređeni i opšti utisci. "
197,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/320783-greg-carmichael,Rating 4 out of 5,"Going into The Bell Jar I expected immediate immersion into a world of gloom followed by the incessant whining that often accompanies that world. Those of you who have read Prozac Nation know exactly what I mean. What else should I have expected from a woman who committed suicide by putting her head in an oven?Perhaps that is why I put it off reading this classic for so long. Yet to my pleasant surprise, the novel opens on a high note describing a young Esther Greenwood in the midst of a summer internship working for a fashion magazine in New York City. We find Esther to be extremely intelligent and analytical if somewhat detached. Plath endears us to Esther through her wit—she takes very little at face value and her whimsical cynicism is strangely charming.Through the first third of the novel, I couldn’t help but imagine her as Capote’s Holly Golightly before she became a top-shelf prostitute (forgetting, of course, all that we learn about Golightly’s past later in the novel). Smart in looks and mind, she maintains an air of fetching naiveté and entitlement, and I fell for her just like Plath wanted me to.It is only after Esther has our affection and sympathy that Plath sends her into the downward spiral that she herself experienced. We track Esther’s illness as she contends with a boyfriend she despises, superficial friends, mental institutions and an obsession to lose her virginity. I found this to be a very real depiction of depression, no doubt due to the autobiographical nature of the novel. Often people associate depression with sadness or some upsetting external issue. Yet as we learn through Esther’s descent, apathy and fatigue are very real culprits and are often seen instead as character defects.The Bell Jar gives us insight into Plath’s particular brand of depression as well as any biography on her could. It is not a cheerful read but has several moments of humor and levity that make it bearable to one not inclined to read a book on this subject."

I have always thought that reviews tell you a LOT more than 'stars' do, because in a simplistic system like that of Goodreads, who knows what the person assigned the stars for.I have various reasons to reject this text on a personal level, but also various reasons to commend it on a public level.The good thing that this novel did, was to highlight how women were still being trivialized in spite of pro-feminist window dressing, such as sending women to ""special"" all-girl schools where the work they did was trivial compared to a man's share.The novel also highlights how dysfunctional family relationships were at the time, and how inadequate mental care was.Also, as pointed out by a friend who lived in a similar era as the author did, there was great societal stigma attached to any kind of mental illness including depression, and it therefore took some bravery for the author to have published this - I suppose some see bravery and some see victimhood - who am I to judge, though? Whatever the case may be, the novel does illustrate why this was/is a problem....so since there are certainly quite a few things I would commend this novel for, then why the reluctance to assign stars? Well, the thing is that there is a Sylvia Plath admiration club cult out there, and I do not want to identify as one of them.Personal reasons for that are discussed with GR friends in the comments section."

201,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/541416-teresa,Rating 4 out of 5,"3.5This edition contains a foreword written by Frances McCullough, one of the early champions of Plath’s writings at Harper. In the foreword, McCullough details the publishing history of this novel and how, and why, as to the when, it finally came to be published in the U.S. The “biographical note” about Plath, written by Lois Ames, concentrates on Plath’s life, instead of on her death, which I appreciated.As soon as I started reading this (it’s a reread but I barely remembered it), I thought of Shirley Jackson, especially her less famous Hangsaman*, with its doubling and search for individuation. Though Jackson was significantly older, she and Plath seem to be writing about (or during) the same time period, and their themes share similarities: the conflicting desires and messages a young woman has and receives from convention, dictated in the form of mothers, or mother-figures; how these can develop into anxieties, neuroses, and breakdowns, both mental and physical. Both Jackson and Plath can be (maybe surprisingly) very funny, though the humor dwindles, appropriately, as their stories continue. Both writers refused to look away from the consequences of topics that were taboo during their times, including the double-standard surrounding sex and the shame of mental illness. The latter, as related to marriage, the ultimate goal even for someone like Esther, who was driven and accomplished at a young age, is broached in the final pages.As soon as I finished the book, I didn’t want to leave the time period and its issues, and I immediately started reading a biography of Shirley Jackson*. As soon as I came upon the name of Sylvia Plath in its introduction, I had to reread the sentence, thinking I must’ve conjured it into being.**Addendum (added 4/28/20)From Shirley Jackson: A Rather Haunted Life by Ruth Franklin, Chapter 2; an endnote credits Linda Wagner-Martin's Sylvia Plath: A Biography, page 97 for this information:Sylvia Plath--whose novel The Bell Jar, which also depicts a young woman's breakdown, was likely influenced by Hangsaman...(Plath who also struggled with her relationship with a domineering mother, admired Jackson and hoped to meet her during a summer internship at Mademoiselle in 1953.)"

""'We'll act as if all this were a bad dream.'A bad dream.To the person in the bell jar, blank and stopped as a dead baby, the world itself is a bad dream."" It's a story like any other one in many ways. It has a main character (not really a hero), there are some anecdotes told, some feelings elaborated on, some other characters described. But unlike many stories out there, it's not really about cherishing life and its pleasures. Through the eyes of the writer, anything people might consider romantic or beautiful seem to be gloomy or meaningless. And it appears that she tries hard to sound indifferent but I don't think this is the case. She describes her surroundings in so much detail and judges everything and everyone through the profuse use of adjectives. In a way, she feels like a lonely outsider, a stranger to what keeps others going. But she's very conscious of these others and takes a stance on them.So all in all, it neither discourages you from ending your life nor gives any answers as to why we should continue breathing. It's a well-told account of a sad being's life. And it has a touch of it could also happen to you. At least I felt that way."

It wasn’t an easy read at all - it’s incredibly bleak, personal and raw in its portrayal of Esther’s decent into depression, and feels (given the author’s history) very real. At times the text feels disjointed, starting at Esther’s time trying to become a successful writer, before quickly descending into abject misery with hospitals and electric shock therapy. You can feel Esther loosing control of her life, her will to live and her ability to care about what happens to her. She’s self destructive, and unlikeable and does questionable things that I could relate to in her quest to try and feel anything. It’s a story I glad I read, and I appreciate the text for everything it had to offer, but I’m not sure it’s one I would ever want to read again. It hits a bit too close to the bone at times. "

I completely forgot about that girl who majored in physics and her fate in the later part of the book, and I was foolishly rooting for her - a girl who wasn't scared of science, in the 50s, how refreshing! Yay! Nay... (At one point when she was very depressed, she was thinking about what it would be like to become Catholic or even a nun, so you won't have to make any choices ever and you life would be micromanaged. I understand why she was thinking that at that point of deterioration and yet it does have ugly implications.)And the funny thing was that this main girl encountered older! women who did have wisdom, skills, professional successes, oh how I wanted to be reading about them and not this whiny hateful girl. The New York part was the better one and yet it was not very good (it had Gilmore Girls energy), but the second part would interest only people who are curious about white middle class women's asylums in the 50s America and it's just a very specific interest I don't posses. I keep seeing people praising the writing and for a famous woman-poet – and I won't lie that I understand poetry – it was so surprisingly plainly written. The language is pretty basic, but it makes for a very quick read at least. This book did nothing for me on any level."

Not only does the Bell Jar deal with mental illnes, it is also a semi-autobiographical novel based on the author's tragic life which adds an extra layer of authenticity and darkness to the story. The portrayal of the descent into mental illness of the main protagonist felt insanely real and depressing.""But when it came right down to it, the skin of my wrist looked so white and defensless that I couldn't do it. It was as if what I wanted to kill wasn't in that skin or the thin blue pulse that jumped under my thumb, but somewhere else, deeper, more secret, and a whole lot harder to get.""""Death must be so beautiful.

Frío, frío, frío. Me gusta el frío. Hay algo oscuro en las sensaciones que provoca. Te entumece, te enferma, te congela, te eriza la piel; es como si tu cuerpo lo rechazara, la interacción entre ambos no es precisamente amistosa. Pero también hay algo reconfortante en como el frío te invade. El invierno puede ser duro para algunos, pero para otros puede representar una zona de confort; hace que todas esas sensaciones oscuras no parezcan fuera de lugar, no porque las oculte, todo lo contrario, sino que hace que convivir con ellas no se sienta fatal y ajeno. Hay veces que el invierno dura más de lo que debería, lo suficiente para creer que uno es uno con él, lo suficiente para dejar de creer en que las estaciones cambian. Lo suficiente para que los rayos de sol ya no sean un consuelo, sino una molestia. Si, La Campana de Cristal es brillante, pero también fría. Muy fría. ""El silencio me deprimía. No era realmente el silencio. Era mi propio silencio.""Becada, en Nueva York, restaurantes lujosos, ropa costosa y un círculo social compatible con esta realidad, cualquiera diría que Esther sería exitosa. Cualquiera diría que Esther era feliz. Cualquiera envidiaría y desearía un estilo de vida como tal. Sin embargo, las superficialidades de la nueva vida neoyorquina de la protagonista si no la decepcionan, la mantienen indiferente. Es como si con su crecimiento se hubiera dado cuenta que, de alguna forma, no perteneciera al estilo de vida que se suponía que quería llevar, aunque todos indicasen lo contrario. ""...todos los pequeños éxitos tan alegremente acumulados en el colegio se apagaban hasta quedar reducidos a nada (...) Se suponía que lo estaba pasando de maravilla."" Desde esta perspectiva, ¿qué tan emocionante puede ser la vida? La simple existencia se vuelve una carga, y encontrarle un sentido a algo tan estúpido y decepcionante como la rutina no lo hace mas llevadero (mas cuando te das cuenta que tu entorno no es mucho menos estúpido y decepcionante como tu vida).En efecto, la soledad y el desinterés empiezan a ejercer lentamente presión sobre Esther, y con el pasar de las páginas vemos cómo se va desatando esta crisis mental que empieza a deteriorarla. Ella entra en las rutas del autodesconocimiento, su mente la consume, y, entonces, el camino la lleva a una profunda desconexión.""Nueva York se está disolviendo, todo se está disolviendo y se está alejando y nada, ninguno de ellos importa ya."" Y cuando nada emociona, nada importa. Ni siquiera su vida. Ni mucho menos su futuro, que una vez pareció ser tan fructífero y ahora se extiende ante ella tan incierto y poco fiable; la idea de que este depende ella no la logra consolar, no cuando apenas puede lidiar con su presente. Se convierte en una carga de la que ella solo quiere librarse. A sus ojos:""Vi mi vida extendiendo sus ramas frente a mí como la higuera verde del cuento De la punta de cada rama, como si de un grueso higo morado se tratara, pendía un maravilloso futuro, señalado y rutilante (...) Me vi a mí misma sentada en la bifurcación de ese árbol de higos, muriéndome de hambre sólo porque no podía decidir cuál de los higos escoger. Quería todos y cada uno de ellos, pero elegir uno significaba perder el resto, y, mientras yo estaba allí sentada, incapaz de decidirme, los higos empezaron a arrugarse y a tornarse negros y, uno por uno, cayeron al suelo, a mis pies.“Podría parecer lo contrario, pero ella no está cegada, perdida quizá, pero inconsciente no. La conciencia de su estado no la hace sentir mejor, lo empeora, la convierte en una testigo de su propio final. Ella identifica esta ""campana de cristal"" que la encierra, la asfixia y la acompaña a donde sea que vaya. Percibe su presencia inhibidora constantemente, y no sabe cómo librarse. Mucho peor: el resto parece favorecer este estado.  Lo describe:""(...)porque donde quiera queestuviera sentada —en la cubierta de un barco o en la terraza de un café en París o enBangkok— estaría sentada bajo la misma campana de cristal, agitándome en mipropio aire viciado.""El dualismo entre la mente y el cuerpo es realmente insostenible. Si bien es lo que nos hace lo que somos, nuestra existencia misma, se comportan como dimensiones diferentes, casi opuestas. Y Esther sabe que hay un problema en su mente; pero esto no es una mera batalla interna, no se resume a un ""somos nuestro peor enemigo"". A veces solo necesitamos un pensamiento positivo lo suficientemente fuerte. A veces esto no es suficiente. Hay algo frío y oscuro allá afuera también a considerar.No estoy a la altura ni es mi intención analizar esto, no le haría justicia, por lo menos, no en mi primera lectura, pero cuando vemos cómo estos personajes y entidades impactan en la vida de Esther, es como si dejaramos de verla como una loca o demente, y la empezaramos a entender como un producto. Una consecuencia de una serie de presiones y convenciones sociales. Efectivamente, hay algo desmoralizante en el trato que los hombres ponen en ella y la posición sexual/cultura a la que nota que es sometida. También en las expectativas del resto sobre su futuro y su cuerpo, muchas provenientes de su propia madre. O también podríamos mencionar esa posición que toma la mayor parte de su círculo de confianza, que finge que todo está bien y no hay nada diferente en Esther, intentando intoxicar el aire con falso optimismo. Ni hablar del juego con la salud mental y los dudosos tratamientos que un poco reflejan el contexto histórico en el que fue escrito el libro.Expresado lo anterior, sería por lo tanto insultante reducir la historia como un mero libro depresivo. La campana de cristal es una obra oscura y triste, así tanto como intelectual y satírica. La autora inserta una (a veces no tan) leve ironía que, bajo el decaimiento de Esther, forman una tenaz crítica hacia los modelos y prejuicios sociales.""Casi toda la gente que conocí en Nueva York estaba tratando de adelgazar.""""Cuanto más incurable se vuelve, más lejos lo esconden a uno.""y cómo ignorar el trato hacia la virginidad y toda la carga cultural que esa ""pureza"" implica. Hay algo hasta gracioso en la decepción que Esther siente al ver un pene por primera vez. ""Cuando yo tenía 19 años la pureza era un gran tema. El mundo estaba dividido entre católicos y protestantes, o entre republicanos o demócratas o entre blancos y negros, o aun entre hombres y mujeres, yo lo veía dividido entre la gente que se había acostado con alguien y la gente que no lo había hecho, y ésta parecía ser la única diferencia verdaderamente significativa entre una persona y otra.“Pero puff, con muchas más citas que comentarios propios, pareciera que el libro tuviera más que decir de mi, que yo de él. Y quizá sea así.Si, la campana de cristal es una novela fría, pero yo sentí calidez. Las experiencias y sensaciones son únicas, no comparables, hay algo hermoso y tétrico en cómo la autora narra su versión, así como valiente y poderoso; pero me sorprendí viendome reflejado en más de una línea, sintiéndome casi desnudo por la precisión de la narración de tal o cual sentimiento. No, no había nada que romantizar ni enorgullecer, pero esto solo hace que La Campana de Cristal se siente una obra importante solo por el trato de su premisa tan delicada. Por último, el redescubrimiento, la luz, que no son ajenos a la novela. Últimamente todo ha sido muy cerebral y frío para mí, ¿cuántos días tienen que pasar para que deje de ser un mal día y sea algo más? Ya casi alcanzando los 20, el concepto de años dorados es tan falso como opresor así como el futuro tan caótico como incierto. Es tan abstracto como mis pensamientos; pero reconocerlo, ponerlo en palabras, no solo puede sentirse sanador, sino también empoderante. Y ahí es donde para mí reside el poder de la novela, después de todo, ¿qué es la luz sin la oscuridad? ""Yo lo recordaba todo (...) Quizás el olvido, como una bondadosa nieve, los entumeciera y los cubriera. Pero eran parte de mí. Eran mi paisaje."""
211,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/101060033-woman-reading-is-far-too-behind-to-catch-up,Rating 3 out of 5,"2.5 ☆ rounded up I've interrupted my streak of reading Cold War espionage novels in order to read The Bell Jar, featured as one of my groups' BOTMs. I realized that Sylvia Plath's semi-autobiographical novel was also a Cold War story, not just because it was set in 1953 but because there was a cold and silent war between the sexes. My analogy may initially seem like an unlikely comparison, except that this dynamic triggered the protagonist's mental health crisis with life-and-death consequences. Esther Greenwood was a 19 year old college student, courtesy of a scholarship providing what couldn't otherwise be afforded on her widowed mother's income. Her writing talent landed her a well-regarded summer internship at a ladies' magazine in New York City, which is when The Bell Jar  began. In short, Esther looked like a young woman with a promising future ahead of her. 

I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was E.G., the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. 

But a casual question about her future revealed to Esther that she didn't know which path to choose. 

I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet. 

Like many other people at that age, Esther was trying to find herself, except that she tripped into full-blown existential despair. The societally-imposed restrictions of the 1950s limited her options and she wasn't able to see a way to forge a unique path appropriate for her. Concepts like equal opportunity for women, discrimination on the basis of sex, and sexual liberation (due to the 1960 FDA approval of the birth control pill) were yet to be acknowledged. 

If neurotic is wanting two mutually exclusive things at one and the same time, then I'm neurotic as hell. I'll be flying back and forth between one mutually exclusive thing and another for the rest of my days. 

Cultural norms encouraged young women to pursue marriage, but Esther noticed what she would forfeit. Esther did not like that at all. 

And I knew that in spite of all the roses and kisses and restaurant dinners a man showered on a woman before he married her, what he secretly wanted when the wedding service ended was for her to flatten out underneath his feet like Mrs. Willard's kitchen mat...I also remembered Buddy Willard saying in a sinister, knowing way that after I had children I would feel differently, I wouldn't want to write poems any more.So I began to think maybe it was true that when you were married and had children it was like being brainwashed, and afterward you went about numb as a slave in some private, totalitarian state. 

In this respect, The Bell Jar was an exceedingly feminist novel. Esther believed that her choices were binary and thus mutually exclusive. She chafed against all of it, including sexual expression. Her fellow acquaintances, good-girl Betsy and the more brazen Doreen, embodied her only two potential examples.

I couldn't stand the idea of a woman having to have a single pure life and a man being able to have a double life, one pure and one not.

On an intellectual level, I understood Esther and why she descended into a terrible depressive fugue. Because even half a century later, women still face double standards and discrimination in the workplace. Some images of women in the 1950s look glamorous with their Christian Door ""New Look,"" white gloves, and decorative hats, but they were the pretty camouflage of the gilded cage. We now know that many mental disorders have a neurological basis. So women who had the seeds of mental illness would be more vulnerable during this period of gender suppression. I don't believe that it was a coincidence that the prescriptions of sedatives were so prevalent among suburban women during the 1950s.

...it wouldn't have made one scrap of difference to me, because wherever I sat - on the deck of a ship or at a street café in Paris or Bangkok - I would be sitting under the same glass bell jar, stewing in my own sour air.To the person in the bell jar, blank and stopped as a dead baby, the world itself is the bad dream.

I can easily see why The Bell Jar  would be regarded as an important component of American literature. Given its plotline and themes, many of which were socially taboo, Plath's book readily lends itself to deconstruction and analysis. But I never connected emotionally with Esther. This was true from the beginning, hence my star rating. The first half of the book revived faint but negative memories of Holden Caulfield of The Catcher in the Rye. Esther seemed like a slightly older, female version, but without the swearing. I had considered abandoning this book, but I persisted because I was curious how Plath would end it. I had listened to the audiobook, performed by Maggie Gyllenhaal, and I'm likelier to finish books in this format. I should also confess that I'm far from Gyllenhaal's biggest fan, which may have contributed to my lackluster emotional reaction. Or it could have been due to Esther reeking of white privilege, despite her humble socioeconomic situation. This is not a book I would want to revisit in the future. The second half of The Bell Jar  is not for anybody susceptible to triggers  because there's a suicide.

Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth, with the grasses waving above one’s head, and listen to silence. To have no yesterday, and no tomorrow. To forget time, to forgive life, to be at peace.

212,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,Rating 5 out of 5,"Back in college, I had been a big fan of poetry and Plath's poetry in particular. It mirrored my own distorted perceptions of reality and my own clinical depression, but beyond that, it was honest, vibrant, and hinted at a kind of transcendence that only people who suffer under a huge weight can truly appreciate.This novel, published under another name in 1963, was close to autobiographical, and beyond that, comes extremely close to matching The Catcher in the Rye and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in feel and in a few other ways, subject as well. Fun fact, this novel was published only a year after Kesey's. In my personal opinion, The Bell Jar is superior to Kesey's novel.Why? Because when I compare Sylvia Plath and the character she portrayed to just about anyone alive, she's NOT crazy. Depressed, certainly, and her circumstances, cultural expectations, and hypocrisies of our society did nothing to help her. Indeed, when she tried to help herself, she always found ways to conflate freedom or excitement with self-destruction, and there's little about this that we aren't all acutely aware of. Our own lives are full of them. It doesn't have to be suicide to mean something similar. Plath's writing is gorgeous. I may not have particularly approved of many of her choices, but I can absolutely put myself in her (or her character's) shoes throughout the entire novel. The Bell Jar, like its namesake, is the feeling of being stifled like a hothouse flower, constrained, even crushed. I'm sure a feminist argument can be made in support of this novel, but I don't really care. This speaks to everyone, male or female or any flavor of human at all. It manages to satirize even as it is brutally honest and revealing and heartbreaking. It DOES do a very good job with all kinds of double-standards without making grand statements unless you consider deep honesty and truth a grand statement. And perhaps I do.At all times as I was reading this, I felt very deeply about the book. I was shivering and horrified and I recognized the nearly blasé outlook on life, the weariness that mixed fully with the hope and the yearning even as all roads were slowly rejected, one realization at a time.This is depression, after all. The gradual shutting down of options. The borders and boundaries creeping in. The claustrophobia of our lives.It may not be everyone's definition, of course, but it is definitely a good one, and this novel is one of the very best that tackles it.Warning. Both the character and the author work out their feelings of suicide. If this triggers you, I won't say you should avoid this work. Indeed, I think it's necessary to face all kinds of truth. Including the fact that Sylvia Plath committed suicide when she was only 31.On that note, some Fight Club:""You're not dying.""""Sorry?""""In the Tibetan philosophy, Sylvia Plath sense of the word,""""I know we're all-- we're all dying, all right?""""But you're not dying the way Chloe back there is dying.""Indeed.

214,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46843838-magdalen,Rating 4 out of 5," ""I was supposed to be having the time of my life""   Some claimed that it was boring, others found it too depressing, which is kind of ironic. What did they expect from a book which is about a young girl’s mental breakdown? Flowers and butterflies? What did they expect from Sylvia Plath? Rainbows and cotton candy? Since it is semi-autobiographical, one should keep in mind that The bell jar is dark, melancholic and depressing. The Bell Jar follows the story of Esther, who gets a summer internship at a magazine but it certainly is so much more. It’s the journey towards Esther’s depression.  The writing is excellent, sharp and authentic. Plath knows exactly what words to use and how to perfectly describe some heart breaking scenes. Therefore, it’s kind of inevitable to feel empathy for Esther. What a tortured, poor soul she was.. (don’t let me get started on her brutal treatment) Plath’s writing is honest, she doesn't sugarcoat anything.  The Bell jar is more than just a story about a girl who slowly corrupts. It shows Esther’s struggles and even though it’s not cheeky (it doesn't have to be tbh) it’s perfect. (and I am in no way glamorizing mental illness) Plath leads you and lets you get a glimpse of a trouble girl’s mind. Her words, her writing, she managed to get under your skin. Unfortunately, it is the only novel she wrote and I can’t help but wish that she had written more..  Anyway, I consider this book one of my top 5 favorites and I recommend it to everyone. And like this beautiful quote says:  “Some books you read. Some books you enjoy. But some books just swallow you up, heart and soul.”  I couldn't have described that feeling while reading this book in a better way.."
215,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/113387426-craig,Rating 4 out of 5,"Two things to note briefly, having finished rereading The Bell Jar:1. I’d like to read (and if one doesn’t exist, maybe to think about doing) a systematic study of poets’ novels. There’s something impossibly satisfying about a novel-sized idea processed through the language and sensibility of a poet. For perhaps good reason, because there’s certainly something of this in the book’s narration, I remembered The Bell Jar as mainly sort of flat and affectless, but in fact it’s astonishingly rich and vivid.2. These two novels couldn’t be more different in every other way—but the feeling I’m left with here is the same mixture of aesthetic satisfaction and melancholy that I get from John Kennedy Toole’s A Confederacy of Dunces. Just imagine the books that Sylvia Plath could have produced in the autumn years of a long lifetime."

It’s hilarious and tragic and I so empathize with the protagonist. Like many first novels, it’s a thinly veiled biographical work.

However, it also reads beautifully, almost as if a poem and a novel had had a love child. It’s such a petty that this novel is so full of teenage self-loathing; it could have been a great manifestation of girl-power – this could have become a great manifesto for educated women who don’t want to follow the norms of society by getting married and leaving all behind to serve a man. The first few lines are so captivating and beautiful that it is difficult to stop reading. The narration alone – not that there is a lot of dialogue – is very morbid and scary in a captivating way. I doubt that there is a novel that expresses the feeling of a woman that doesn’t belong better than this story. Perhaps this is one of the best novels written from a female point of view but sadly, it feels so overshadowed by the author’s life and her suicide that at times, while reading, it feels difficult to separate fact from fiction. Furthermore, the biggest shame is that the author decided to end her own life before making more horrifyingly beautiful novels like this one. I wish I could give this novel five stars but I can’t. It has to be four. It is, however, a very enjoyable read – you, the reader, just have to learn to enjoy reading this novel. It should be viewed as a warning to prevent suicide by mental illness.For a full review click on the link below:https://medium.com/@michel.narvaez.08..."

It starts off as a story of Esther Greenwood who is having a terrible time growing up. She doesn’t fit in well with other people and is very awkward at times. And all she can think about is how much she wants to die. This is a terribly sad book because it shows how society and healthcare let her down. Even when seeking treatment, she did not get the treatment she needed. She got what was available at the time -shock treatment. The book becomes even sadder when you compare it to the real life of Sylvia Plath the author. The story parallels the troublesome times Sylvia has just dealing with life. This book is definitely worth giving a read!"

232,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4739465-monica,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Bell Jar is simultaneously very affecting and very scary. Mental illness ain’t no beanbag. Start with a young woman who seems to have all the luck. Good looks, height, a sense of style, intelligent, articulate, enviable job as a writer in New York etc and experience as she slowly succumbs to depression. It’s all very matter of fact. There is no real trigger within her life that one could point and say, here’s why it happened. I think therein lies the brilliance of the novel. Plath is allowing you inside the mind of a person losing a grasp on reality. Many believe it to be somewhat autobiographical with Plath committing suicide in the year this book was published. Esther Greenwood’s illness is never formally diagnosed, but she has attempted suicide several times and seems to be lost between reality and fantasy. In fact her relationship to what is happening in the real world is somewhat tepid. She dips in and out of fantasy and the real world with a rather emotionally detached persona. She is in and out of several asylums where the prescribed treatment is electroshock therapy. Plath’s descriptions are horrific. The patients are literally coerced into acting sane or else more shock treatment. Esther wonders how one Doctor (Nolan) can possibly know if the shock treatment she administers is done correctly compare with what she had experienced earlier. “Did the doctor ever undergo shock therapy?”, she wonders. She makes what appears to be improvement over the years where she is granted additional privileges and keeps meeting up with friends and people from the past. In this book Esther is an extremely unreliable narrator. It is hard to discern what is real. The book ends cryptically with her going to see a board about getting released from the asylum. Was it a hopeful note or one of repeated never ending tedium a sentence to live out a fantasy life with no real hope of any new real life experiences? This was an extremely melancholy book and in my view a very important one. Esther’s sense of befuddlement, anger, confusion, disorientation, emotional disconnection was all too real. There is an emptiness or void of emotion that seems to come with depression. What I think Plath has accomplished in this book was to impose empathy and some semblance to comprehension for people to begin to see the suffering and isolation and emotional detachment etc, that seems to accompany the illness. This book was masterful in its portrayal of depression. The treatment for mental illness still requires urgent attention and action some 50 years later. It still seems woefully inadequate these days though treatment of choice seems to be drugs rather than electroshock therapy with similarly disparate outcomes. But depression is a condition that is still wrongly associated with poor judgement, shame, a lack of self-control, weak willed and/or personal failing etc. Novels like this shine a light on a huge amount of suffering affecting more people than is comfortable to contemplate. Also, aside from an occasional ham-handed remark about people of color, which I ascribe to the times that this book was written; it is timeless. A very difficult and sad novel that stands up well to the test of time.4.5 Stars"

To willingly dive into the murky poetry pool, that’s how much I loved this book.ANYWAYI am choosing to fill my little white box with a story instead of a review because that’s where this book left me. Here is where you should jump ship if you are a book synopsis review kind of person. Although let’s be honest, I don’t typically offer that kind of service anyway.Ready? Here we go:There was a small flea market down the road from my grandmother’s growing up. Giving us a few dollars and letting us pick out a random treasure was always a special treat when grandma took us down there. My top two picks, a white model horse toy and two pinned butterflies on display under a little glass dome. The latter had a foam seal around the base so you could take the dome on and off whenever you liked. With a little sister sharing the same roof, I would rarely do so and only in the privacy of my top bunk sanctuary. For around fifteen years I would not allow anyone to touch or hold my little butterfly treasure and I kept it shelved high, safe from curious hands. One split second of anger out of my first child when she was a toddler brought an end to my little dome of wonders and I bawled my eyes out when it happened. It was one of those moments when the realities of all that was and is come crashing together and you can’t even catch your breath to comprehend it all.That is what this book reminded me of. Those memories entwined forever in one moment. See I like to hold and capture good memories and live under them, almost in a fog. I tie these little mental stories to items or songs and replay the shit out of them to maintain an even keel. My daughter shattering that particular portkey woke me the hell up. It wasn’t too long after that the white model horse toy I had stashed away all those years before was placed into her hands. The dome was off."

239,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63883678-vartika,Rating 4 out of 5,"The 1950s were not a great time for women (not even white women, unlike what fetishists and Lana Del Rey may like to believe). The sheen of optimism that enveloped America in the post-war years was what made it more of a Man's world: an ideal that compensated for the gloom and danger of the world wars with renewed conservatism. It was thus even less of a good time for ambitious women — and Sylvia Plath was one of them.  The Bell Jar,  her sole novel published mere weeks before her suicide, lays bare with lacerating honesty the struggles of a woman growing up in a time that wanted its women to shrink. Thus, the semi-autobiographical world of  The Bell Jar  opens into a world of opportunities for the protagonist Esther Greenwood, who wins a highly-competitive and coveted internship at a fashion magazine in New York. But as she notes early in the book, everyone around her is trying to reduce, while her aspirations are to  broaden  her horizons and take up her own place in the world. In many senses of the word, this is an intensely feminist book (in context of its own time, of course), where the protagonist often confronts and states her own yearning to be on an equal footing with men while also negotiating with the 'feminine goals' she has been brought up to believe. Esther, as Plath herself, is often found to observe and contemplate the control exerted on the female body: be it observing sexual relations, motherhood, or the dominant medical attitudes towards childbirth and general female complaints of illness (Buddy, the medical student she dates, asserts that her sinus issues are most definitely psychosomatic), or even the facts of being housed in a supervised, women-only hotel for her internship. In fact, as it says in the 2018 BBC documentary  Inside The Bell Jar,  it is probably the idea of being relegated to the literary equivalent of women's work (an idea that she despises) at the fashion magazine, along with the overwhelming personal pressures she felt, that push Esther into a spiral of despair and depression. At the heart of it,  The Bell Jar  is an brutal, immersive story of depression and mental illness; a painfully honest account of the descent, dehumanisation, and stigma of it that leaves nothing to romanticise. Mental illness in the 50s  was  dehumanisation, and this book portrays this vicious aspect of psychiatric treatment with chilling, unflinching honesty, for this was a time when electroshock was unjudiciously and unthinkingly prescribed as a curative for everything, be it treason or depression, even though it did, in effect, more harm than good. Plath's writing comes from experiencing psychiatric treatment at a time when it was a source of shame, something to be hidden — ""The more hopeless you were the further away they hid you."" But as in the case of some, like Esther, Joan, and Plath herself, mental illness was often itself hidden, existing behind happy-looking and often successful faces. I also found it quite telling that it is Philomela Guinea, the successful woman writer who funds Esther's scholarship, who shifts Esther to the care of a better doctor. Guinea herself had been at an asylum in her youth, and understands, while even Esther's own mother can not. It is widely known that  The Bell Jar  is highly autobiographical, based on Plath's own experiences at the age of 19, but there is this portion in the book, right before Esther finally takes the sleeping pills, where she decides that she will spend the summer working on a novel:   ""My heroine would be myself, only in disguise. She would be called Elaine. Elaine. I counted the letters on my fingers. There were six letters in Esther, too. It seemed a lucky thing.""   This quote, most of all, makes the story even most real to me: the name Sylvia has six letters, too. At another point, later in the novel, Esther thinks to herself that if 'it' ever gets that bad again, she would not subject herself to living through it again. This is the only point where I allow myself to think of the tragedy of the author's eventual death by suicide. I also allow myself a brief moment thinking about how 'it' was there again: the personal pressures, the relegation to a lesser literary ghetto that denied her the recognition she felt she deserved (The Guardian had called the book, then published under the pseudonym of Victoria Lucas, ""a sprightly little tale."" When the book was reissued after her death, of course, the cult of Plath had taken shape and the reviews changed shape, too). Today,  The Bell Jar  is recognised by most for the literary landmark it is — thoughtful, dark, even funny — the mark of a fine writer who wrote her own painful experience into something that has proven cathartic for millions of readers. Despite carrying the signs of its time, both good and bad, it is also a timeless tale of struggle, aspiration and humanness.  Cover Story The 1950s were not a great time for women, and so even though I can not excuse them I understand and contextualise the lukewarm reviews and the sexism of publishers. But this edition was published in 2013, and I have a major bone to pick with Faber & Faber about it. If you pick up this edition not knowing much about Plath and/or what  The Bell Jar  is about, you would probably think it belongs to what a lot of people call the 'chick-lit' genre, and you would think it is juvenile. That's because Faber & Faber seem to have deliberately made it look that way — what else explains the glamourised image on the cover or the blurb at the back which makes the book sound like something it really is not? Absolutely nothing on the cover tells you about the intensity of this story, and how it deals with mental illness and suicide. Now, Faber & Faber have a long history of giving The Bell Jar  these stupid, sexist covers, but I expected better for the 50th Anniversary Edition — better than a lousy image of a woman with a compact and a small blob stating the fact that this is an anniversary edition, at any rate. I would expect, for instance, a proper introduction to be included with the book — you know, the way it would be done for a book of similar magnitude had it been written by a man. But no. Nothing. What's worse is that the irony of all this seems to be lost on the publishers."

Dopala mi se ili ne - volim da izazove neki utisak. A Silvija Plat definitivno to jeste ucinila. Nakon normal people, verovatno je ovo knjiga koja mi je izazvala jedina takvu kolicinu pomesanih emocija. Ostavila me je blago zbunjenom, trazila sam informacije o njenom zivotu jer je bilo tesko citati knjigu, a ne razmisljati o paralelama, s obzirom na to da ima nekih istinitih momenata, a autorka se ubila mesec dana nakon objavljivanja knjige. Ocekivala sam da se ja licno vise povezem, ali nekako nisam uspela. Neke recenice, poput one sa staklenim zvonom ili one o zeni poput luka i strele su mi se dopale bas, ali opet, falilo mi je nesto. To nesto bi bili opisi osecanja, jer je knjiga samo prepricala dozivljaje glavne junakinje Ester Grinvud, kao da pratimo dnevnik. Smetalo mi je i jer su neki delovi nepovezani. Recimo imamo jednu scenu, a onda bez prelaska na novo poglavlje, bez razmaka, prebacuje se na drugu scenu. Ipak, citala sam da je muz unistio neke delove njenih rukopisa, kao i da je ona to pisala bez nekih ispravki, s obzirom na to kako se osecala, mogu da razumem da ima propusta. Stilski mi je bila vrlo zanimljiva. Nikada u zivotu nisam citala knjigu a uspevala da sve zamislim toliko detaljno kao da gledam i film, tacno su se stvarale slike pred mojim ocima. Ester kao lik bila mi je simpaticna ipak kada se sve sabere i oduzme. Ali sam ocekivala vise unutrasnjih emocija, manje opisa okruzenja i svega drugog, poput onih zurki, Njujorka u pocetku, neki delovi su mi malo i nerealni, ali sve u svemu drago mi je sto sam je procitala. Nisam preodusevljena da bih dala 5 jer mi je tesko da ocenim nesto samo na osnovu tezine teme, imam taj trenutak gde mi neke stvari kvare utisak, ali opet je nesto sto me je zaintrigiralo i sto ce mi ostati u secanju nakon nekog vremena."

I was reading it foregoing breakfast, lunch and even dinner if my mother allowed it. I only stopped for that and my evening walk as I consider that part of my daily routine essential for my mental well being. First of all I want to apologize to Ms. Slyvia Plath for allowing this book to grow old on my bookshelf for decades. I should truly be hit on the head with a large bat for it. This book felt personal and struck a chord in me I never thought it will.Esther Greenwood felt to me like a soul sister, a reflection of myself for I have never related to a character as I have as to her. Yes, I know the implications that sentence brings, and I mean each one of it. Maybe many did feel that connection to her, or someone felt as an outsider looking at the personal downward spiral of hers, like watching a linear movie in the theater. It was like getting sucked into the vortex of a tornado called Esther Greenwood. One where I did not have a single thought of escaping. I rather enjoyed being carried away by its gale. I never sympathized with Esther and I did not understand why few people even pitied her. There seem to be nothing to be pitied. There was something always vulnerable in her but it was nothing to be pitied. We all know that the book did reflect in some instances to that of Plath herself and many know how her journey came to an end. So in a way we can truly comprehend what would have been the end of Esther herself.As I came closer and closer to the end, I did not want to finish it. I could have easily finished the book in a day but I kept it aside while I had the last two chapters left and picked it up again after a good 12 hours or more. I needed to arrange my thoughts and felt as if I was saying goodbye to an old and dear freind. I wanted to bury my head in the pages and cry and wallow. No, not a single tear actually escaped me as I read the book yet my heart was always thrumming as I felt the familiarity with her as if one of my own darkest deepest secrets have been laid bare on the pages. Will I read it again? Yes but not any time soon. As I told my best friend in a call as I gushed on and on about the book, I do not think it is healthy for me to reread it so soon. I can almost feel it becoming an obsession, a part I want to hold on tightly and not let go."

I love how a Reader's filters change over time (hopefully for the better) and leads to a completely different experience with the exact same text. What will I think of this book when I read it at 65 years?And but I really enjoyed the novel in my '20s; I just at that point hadn't had three people in my life suffer through and lose their lives to crippling depression. Plath's protagonist provided me an inner monologue that might have sounded similar to what these people experienced, and it was only re-reading the novel that made me realize my interaction with these tortured friends/family was one of satellite orbit to their malady. I could never inhabit that inner space with them, to provide them meaningful comfort - despite my thinking at the time I was perhaps doing so. Esther's bell jar is the right metaphor; I'm not getting in, and they couldn't discern how to get out.If for nothing else, reading this novel alongside all of you wise and wonderful GREATreaders proves to me, yet again, how fantastic this website is. I learned so much from all the comments on the discussion feeds - and saw parts of the text in ways I didn't see at all (e.g. the lesbianism). So thank you, all of you, that took the time to share your thoughts and perspectives on the book.

246,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish,Rating 3 out of 5,"Oh wow. I've never read anything by Sylvia Plath but I'm told her poetry is deeply moving and gorgeous. For some reason, I decided not to start with that but with this novel instead.The MC, Esther, is 19 years old and has won an internship at a fashion magazine in the beginning. She's pretty, supposedly smart (though I didn’t get that impression, frankly), talented and now also regarded as successful. The only problem is that she sees her own life quite differently and keeps sabotaging herself. Because Esther, slowly but surely, is having a mental breakdown (total spiral into a deeeeep depression).Interestingly, this novel is semi-autobiographical. Sylvia Plath herself interned at a fashion magazine, suffered a mental breakdown, and even tried to kill herself. That gives the musings in this story a special kind of gravitas.The writing was lyrical and started off with a bang, only intensifying from there. However, I also found there to be too much melodrama, or at least melodramatic behavior from the MC, and I usually have a problem with people who have a good life but keep wanting more and expecting everything to just fall into their laps (it seems ungrateful to me). I’m also not one for gossip - it not only bores but even annoys me - and can’t muster sympathy for self-destructive behavior, especially when the same self-destructive people then style themselves as the victims of circumstances that are out of their hands.As such, I just couldn't get into Esther's musings on her fading teint and rolled my eyes frequently about her superficial inner monologue. I mean, a woman who makes fun of the colour of other people’s outfits (refusing to getting to know them if they wear this or that colour) and who proclaims to be collecting men with interesting names? Give me a break!Which is not to say that a young woman going over the mental edge like that (or what happened to her along the way) left me entirely cold. We’re talking about a time when shock treatments were normal. But at the same time I couldn’t help but growing more and more exasperated at her continuously provoking terrible situations.And yes, the social norms from back in those days are infuriating to many modern people, myself included. Nobody gets to tell me what to do or who to be (if I have to marry, whom, that I need to give birth constantly etc). But every generation has problems with their respective society’s norms and it’s just no excuse.I guess I just couldn’t warm to Esther and it does make me wonder if I would have liked Plath herself or, indeed, will like her other work.The writing style was what stood out for me most. It was actually superb! Such an odd contrast, not liking the protagonist at all but almost falling in love with how the story of said protagonist was written. Thus, the writing was the best thing about this novel, along with the merciless reckoning with society. Just the fact that the book talks about mental health issues, and in such detail, and even critiquing the outwardly presented perfect facade and social norms back then does indeed justify this being a classic.My rating: 3.5 stars and I have no idea if I'll round up or down."

Sicuramente, per assorbire un romanzo come questo, bisogna avere la pazienza di riflettere su temi molto dolorosi. E' uno dei romanzi più dolorosi che io abbia mai letto, per via del racconto della malattia mentale della protagonista. Questo racconto è di una brutalità particolare, poiché la maggior parte dei romanzi che ho letto, con temi simili, hanno narratori che non sono essi stessi i malati. Qui invece Esther è la narratrice e la malata. Ho trovato sincero e calzante il paragone che viene fatto con la malattia: quando una persona è malata, il mondo esterno è una campana che la copre. E quindi soffoca. Ecco spiegato il titolo.Aldilà dei temi trattati - e di come vengono trattati in modo secondo me magistrale - mi è piaciuta anche la prosa; lo stile di scrittura denota una autrice di grande talento. Mi è piaciuto il personaggio, il suo sarcasmo iniziale, e poi la discesa nella malattia. Ho apprezzato la costruzione del romanzo, il modo spietato in cui è raccontato tutto. Alla fine la protagonista sembra risalire la china della malattia, sembra essere pronta ad uscire dall'ospedale psichiatrico e ritornare alla vita. Sarà così? Il libro si chiude prima che possiamo esserne certi. Mi sembra una ottima conclusione, con un pizzico di speranza ma anche piena di incertezza. Ma la vita reale è così. Mi rendo conto che si tratta di un romanzo fortemente autobiografico; quella lucentezza e precisione nel descrivere la malattia, in prima persona, lo dobbiamo alla reale esperienza di Sylvia Plath la quale, purtroppo, morirà dopo un mese dalla pubblicazione di questo romanzo indimenticabile.""Feci un profondo respiro e ascoltai il mio cuore ripetere l'antica vanteria. Io sono, io sono, io sono."""

I thought, ""This is what it is to be happy.” I love many of the poems that Sylvia Plath created, and in The Bell Jar she carried her elegant writing style to the form of the novel. This is the only book that Sylvia Plath wrote, and in my opinion, and many others, it is fantastic. For a book released in 1963, it is so progressive, with Sylvia Plath engaging with taboo subjects in a way that seems so natural, exploring these themes and ideas through characters that feel so real.On that topic, the characters are fantastic, as Sylvia Plath portrays life in all its randomness, with realistic humour, moments of severity and the full exploration of the effects of depression and pressure. The characters each have their own motivations, and Sylvia Plath shows how, perhaps engaging with a cynical outlook. Everyone is looking out for themselves.“If you expect nothing from somebody you are never disappointed.” The prose is absolutely beautiful. In my opinion it makes sure not to be too indulgent, but hits that balance of beauty whilst being sharp and making sure to keep the story, themes and setting at the core. The prose is really used wonderfully to build on these, and does a fantastic job with the tone and atmosphere, especially in a book where these shift so dramatically at times.“The silence depressed me. It wasn't the silence of silence. It was my own silence.” The Bell Jar has become a classic, and I really see why. It is an expertly crafted story that engages with themes so well, both shocking the reader, but also exploring these ideas in a subtle way at the same time. A fantastic look into the effects of pressures of society, isolation and depression.5/5 STARS"

Las similitudes entre su protagonista, Esther Greenwood, y la propia Sylvia están muy presentes. Porque a través de 'La campana de cristal', Sylvia nos muestra su alma, llena de miedos y como caminando sobre el borde de una abismo desde el que caer y hacerse añicos.Sylvia Plath fue conocida sobre todo por su obra poética, convirtiéndose en una de las poetas norteamericanas más importantes del pasado siglo. Sus poemas y su única novela, contienen una gran carga autobiográfica. La lectura de 'La campana de cristal' me ha dejado un sabor agridulce. Por una parte, he conocido a una chica, apenas salida de la adolescencia, inteligente y con talento, brillante, con un gran futuro, y esto me ha gustado. Pero por otra, está esa Esther (o Sylvia, porque ya no sé quién es quién) que camina por un hilo muy fino, que puede romperse en cualquier momento y hacerla caer en la locura, a la que querría ayudar de alguna manera, algo lógicamente imposible, porque no me gusta verla así.Esta chica, Esther, tiene diecinueve años, y nos cuenta cómo fue su periplo en Nueva York, el mes que pasó allí tras ganar una beca que consiste en trabajar durante un mes en una revista. En esta primera parte de la novela, conocemos parte de su pasado, la muerte de su padre cuando ella tenía nueve años, sus dudas frente al amor y sus reticencias hacia el sexo, sus esperanzas para el futuro próximo, su relación con Buddy Willard, alguien que marcará su vida para bien o para mal, todo ello bajo el telón de fondo de ese Nueva York lleno de boato y fiestas de lujo.Y después entramos en la segunda parte de la novela, mucho más dura, donde nos encontramos a una Esther de regreso a su antigua vida, donde despertará su miedo atávico a la vida, a qué será de ella a partir de ahora, a cómo conducir su vida. Como ella dice, ""para la persona encerrada en la campana de cristal, vacía y detenida como un bebé muerto, el mundo mismo es la pesadilla"". Crisis nerviosas, no come, no puede ni leer ni escribir, depresión... Dolor, dolor, dolor.

Por lo mismo, el ánimo de avanzar en la lectura está fundamentado en el interés por las experiencias de su personaje - o, también, en una fijación por la autora - más que por la calidad estructural de su narrativa.Pese a esto, no me sorprende que La campana de cristal sobreviva en el tiempo como un artefacto de culto, especialmente entre las lectoras.

This tone becomes chilling when sharp insights are delivered with wit. The infamy of this novel makes it hard not to see this as a tragic tale. Esther Greenwood, in her late teens, is admitted to a psychiatric ward when she attempts to kill herself. Esther shares with us her story, she shows how it led up to this and the events that follow. This is an unsettling read because of Sylvia Plath’s realistic portrait of a person who is coping with the things that most of us would take for granted. It’s world where there is more darkness than light. However, the story does not ask to pity Esther Greenwood, neither does it give a spotlight to her courage. When the story ends it’s on a small glimmer of hope. The Bell Jar’s crisp writing, and its modest telling of a heroic tale, is what keeps bringing me back to read this again."

Le curve del pensiero, sovrapposte, per lo più combacerebbero con le nostre e soltanto qualche sbavatura qua e là dimostrerebbe che, dopotutto, non si tratta della stessa curva. Quando un libro lo ha scritto una persona che pensava come te, tu non puoi far niente: tentare di opporre resistenza è inutile. Tentare di non lasciarsi ammaliare, inutile. Tentare di mantenere una distanza critica, inutile. Un canto di sirena si dipana fino a te dalla pagina. A mettere i tappi di cera non hai neanche provato. Ascolti. Caschi contento nel gorgo. Qualcuno ha pensato bene di paragonare ‘La campana di vetro’ a ‘Il giovane Holden’, chiamando la protagonista, Esther, la sua controparte femminile. I romanzi, in realtà, non si somigliano molto. Lo sguardo di Holden è fresco, è uno sguardo di chi si può ancora salvare. Lo sguardo di Esther è allucinato, uno sguardo che ti trascina sul fondo. A Holden accarezzeresti la testa: tu non sei Holden, sei con Holden. A Esther la testa non la puoi accarezzare, a meno che appoggiarti la mano sulla nuca non ti sembri un gesto comunissimo. Davanti a entrambi, a Holden come a Esther, si snoda un gomitolo di dolori e di strade, di ricordi, di scene e colori che non riescono a dimenticare. Ma Holden lo guardiamo e facciamo il tifo per lui, siamo tutti lì a urlare che è giovane, che si può tirar fuori, che può essere felice. Con Esther il pensiero non ci sfiora nemmeno: essere felice, per lei, sarebbe un tradimento. Quando la conosciamo, Esther è una diciannovenne molto fortunata. Ha vinto uno stage presso una prestigiosa rivista di moda, dopo una carriera scolastica costellata tutta di borse di studio e voti altissimi. È fidanzata con un bel ragazzo destinato a diventare un brillante dottore. È abbastanza graziosa, troppo intelligente e scrive poesie. No, non scrive poesie, è un poeta. La qualifica di poeta è la sola che Esther si dia autonomamente, la sola che sembri riconoscere, la sola che conti qualcosa. Ed è solo e proprio nel momento in cui scopre di non essere più un poeta – quando si mette alla macchina da scrivere e non le viene fuori niente, quando le lettere tracciate sul foglio di carta le restituiscono una grafia distorta e infantile – che qualcosa dentro di lei si spacca con un fracasso infernale. Fino a quel momento, Esther era sì consapevole di avere davanti delle difficoltà, consapevole che le sue capacità mentali si stavano pian piano sfilacciando, ma mai il terrore la aveva invasa fino a paralizzarla, a spingerla a risoluzioni estreme quali il suicidio, i suicidi, i mille piccoli tentativi di annientarsi disposti qua e là lungo tutta la narrazione e destinati a scattare a vuoto come trappole per topi mal congegnate. Uccidendosi, Esther non ucciderebbe niente di più che un involucro. Il soffio vitale è già fuori di lei. È uscito, si è perduto, esploso al contatto con la vita e i suoi meccanismi di produzione e distruzione. Eppure, anche se Esther è già morta, anche se la sola Esther che conti è già morta, tutti si affaccendano intorno al suo cadavere per far sì che l’involucro non muoia. Coccolano il suo scheletro, ci parlano, lo ingozzano di insulina. « Capii allora che il mio corpo conosceva un’infinità di trucchetti, tipo togliere la forza alle mie mani nel momento cruciale, che gli avrebbe salvato ogni volta la vita, mentre, se fosse dipeso solo da me, in un attimo l’avrei fatta finita. Dunque dovevo tendergli un’imboscata con quel po’ di intelligenza che mi rimaneva, altrimenti quello mi avrebbe tenuta intrappolata nella sua stupida gabbia per altri cinquant’anni di ebetudine ». Ma il corpo non è l’unica gabbia contro cui Esther deve dibattersi. Il corpo è soltanto la gabbia più superficiale, quella che aderisce strettamente allo spirito. Sopra il corpo tutta un’altra serie di pinnacoli e di guglie si innalza, e questa è la campana di vetro. La campana di vetro è la matrioska multistrato in cui sei immerso dacché sei nato. Nella matrioska più piccola c’è la tua famiglia, in quella poco sopra la famiglia che ti formerai, poi la scuola, il lavoro, le istituzioni, le consuetudini, i sistemi di pensiero, le religioni. A volerla sfogliare tutta come una cipolla, la campana di vetro ha la forma del cosmo. Tutto il cosmo in ogni sua parte è una campana di vetro. Essendo grande, la campana non pesa su tutti allo stesso modo. In qualche punto, anzi, si respira abbastanza bene. Ma a seconda delle circostanze, del sesso, dell’educazione la campana ti preme un po’ di più o un po’ di meno. Se sei una donna come Esther, nell’America degli anni Cinquanta, la campana di vetro ti pesa addosso un bel po’. Innanzitutto, o ti sposi o sei poeta. Qualunque persona sana di mente vedrà che sono impossibili insieme. Secondo, o ti sposi e rimani vergine per tuo marito (mentre tuo marito, beninteso, non rimane vergine per te) o hai una vita sessuale franca e schietta e allora subisci le conseguenze a tuo carico (vedi gravidanze indesiderate e scandali). A dirla tutta, la società perbenista e maschilista nella quale Esther è immersa è quella che di più appesantisce la campana di vetro. Per Esther gli uomini sono creature grottesche, tra le quali si muove con circospezione, e che si dividono in ‘uomini che potresti sposare e che quindi ti trasformerebbero in una moglie-zombie accondiscendente’ e ‘uomini che potresti scopare e quindi usare per assumere il controllo sul tuo corpo, sulle tue emozioni, sui tuoi cicli’. « Era sempre la stessa storia: adocchiavo un ragazzo e da lontano sembrava perfetto, ma non appena si faceva più vicino, scoprivo che non mi piaceva più. Era uno dei motivi per cui non intendevo sposarmi. L’ultima cosa che desideravo era la sicurezza assoluta ed essere il punto da cui scocca la freccia dell’uomo. Io volevo novità ed esperienze esaltanti, volevo essere io una freccia che vola in tutte le direzioni, come le scintille multicolori dei razzi il 4 luglio». Il fantasma del matrimonio e l’incubo della verginità – l’amore non è tra le alternative – pendono sulla testa di Esther come una solida spada di Damocle. Lei si sposta un po’ da una parte e un po’ dall’altra. Ma nel centro, nell’oscillazione è la follia. Altro sonoro rintocco sulla campana di vetro è il din-don della religione. Cattolicesimo, unitarianesimo, puritanesimo sono tutte uguali, tutte ugualmente pronte a incasellarti nei loro schemi rigidi, quegli schemi comodi come linee rette nei quali non c’è alcun bisogno di pensare. « Gli avevo detto che credevo nell’inferno, e che certe persone, io per esempio, erano condannate a vivere all’inferno durante la vita, per compensare il fatto di non andarci dopo morte, visto che non credevano nell’aldilà, e che dopo la morte a ciascuno succede quello in cui aveva creduto ». Poi ci sono i genitori, che ti vogliono sana, stupida e felice. Poi gli amici, che ti vogliono simpatica e vestita bene. Poi i dottori, che vogliono sapere perché stai male. E infine ci sei te, il nocciolo duro della campana di vetro, la punta di diamante che ruota e strilla e strepita ma non crepa. La campana non si rompe. Se si incrina, la aggiusteranno per te. Non potrai mai fuggire. Io credo che questo libro fiero, crudo, spietato sarebbe molto più noto di quanto già non sia se solo in copertina non ci fosse quel nome di donna che fa storcere il naso ai maschietti, se chi l’ha scritto non si fosse suicidato, attirandosi quei sospetti di ‘cianfrusaglia deprimente scritta da una persona disturbata’. Io credo che un libro che scava così tanto nella malattia e nel suicidio, un libro che ci fa entrare nelle vasche da bagno e nelle cliniche dove ti addomesticano con l’elettroshock, acquisti una validità ancora più assoluta per il fatto – ovvio, brutale – che Sylvia Plath ha effettivamente vissuto quel che racconta, che ha portato la merenda ai suoi bambini e ha infilato la testa in un forno e nessuno, nessuno l’ha trovata prima che fosse troppo tardi. Io credo che questo libro non dica ‘La vita fa schifo, perché non ce la togliamo tutti?’. Anzi, io credo che questo libro voglia dire o almeno dica a me, ‘Ecco, qui sta il problema, qui, proprio qui, dietro l’orecchio destro, e adesso che io te l’ho circoscritto e definito, sta a te vedere come puoi estirparlo. Se puoi estirparlo. Se vuoi estirparlo.’Io credo e lo dico sinceramente che perdere Sylvia Plath sia stata una gran perdita. E avrei preferito che rimanesse con me, che scrivesse altri tre, altri quattro libri come questo, invece che scriverne uno solo e suggellarlo col più definitivo, col più puro atto di potenza. "
259,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47627265-kaylin-the-re-read-queen,Rating 4 out of 5,"4 StarsSome books are just hard to review… and this is one of them. Because how do you review something that feels so personal? First published in 1963, I understand why Plath’s semi-autobiographical is still so widely read. This is raw and unapologetic. The narrator, Esther walks us through a year in her life as her depression becomes overwhelming, she encounters ECT, and navigates mental health in the 1950s. It’s rarely pretty, and sometimes felt so ugly and personal it almost felt wrong to read. But it’s more than just a journal, as Plath’s lyrical writing portrays Esther’s struggles in a mesmerizing manner, the surreal merges with the relatable. One of my favorite examples is the passage where Eleanor envisions all of her possible futures each as a separate fig on a large tree. And then relays feeling paralyzed by the decision and losing all the other possibilities.
”I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.” 
 Plath’s beautiful and metaphorical writing manages to describe big-isolating feelings. Being able to name and express an emotion like that felt so powerful.  I think there are times the narrative revels in these moments, and borders romanization in places—though through the lens of a narrator who is mentally ill, so it’s a weird critique. Which brings me back to how hard this is to review. Because as a reader, the ending feels abrupt and Esther’s relationship with her therapist difficult to track. But I also understand Plath was trying to write an ending to something she was still going through.Overall:This is an uncomfortable read. It’s absurdly personal as a woman navigates through the overwhelming aspects of mental illness. It attempts to define the ill defined, and sometimes it succeeds, sometimes it really succeeds, and sometimes it doesn't. "

I felt like I should have been reading it for class, like I missed several important details that would have been pointed out to me had a professor been instructing me through it. I finished it feeling like a dummy, which is one of my pet peeves as a reader. I'm gonna go read a summary of this book and then come back to publish final thoughts before I post a really ignorant review. (later)Okay. I think my overall afterthought about this book is that it did not turn out how I would have expected it to, which is frustrating. I thought it would be this dark and grotesque story about a woman struggling with depression, which is was, but the ending unsettled me. I was so disoriented by it that I actually, as you saw, had to google why Esther made the decisions she did. This is the only thing that sits wrongly with me.On the other hand, I adored this story. The way that the writing reflects Esther state of mind is genius and marvelous. The subtle social commentaries about sexuality and the patriarchy and conformity are very valid fears to have, and I found myself especially relating to them as a fellow college student. I've never had depression or suicidal thoughts, so I think this book might elicit more emotion and empathy from a person who has gone through the same ordeal (although hopefully nobody will have undergone the same disgusting treatments that Esther was forced through). Esther seemed like such a complacent character, and her disdain toward societal norms like having to get married and have kids was very apparent, but the shift from her disappointment to actually attempting suicide was a bit sudden to me. It may have been because I read this book over the course of a month-- way longer than I would typically take to read a book-- so the timeline of events could have been distorted in my own perception. I would recommend this book if you're someone who would like to read a book about the uncensored inner thoughts of troubled woman. It was really interesting, and though I wish I'd better comprehended the storyline, Esther was oddly relatable."

Η ηρωίδα, η Έστερ, μου έδινε συνεχώς την εντύπωση ότι προσπαθούσε να ισορροπήσει πάνω σε ένα τεντωμένο σχοινί. Έβλεπε τον κόσμο μέσα από τα μάτια ενός ανθρώπου που προσπαθούσε διαρκώς να δώσει απαντήσεις σε αυτό που η κοινωνία πρόσταζε γι’ αυτήν και σε αυτό που η ίδια πραγματικά επιθυμούσε για να είναι ευτυχισμένη. Και με αυτόν ακριβώς τον τρόπο η Σύλβια Πλαθ μας άνοιξε την ψυχούλα της και μίλησε για την αδυναμία της να το επιτύχει. 	Σε μια ζωή όπου η μετάβαση από την εφηβική στην ενήλικη ζωή απαιτεί κατά βάση να διαμορφώνουμε τη ζωή μ��ς βάσει των κοινωνικών προσδοκιών αδιαφορώντας για ό,τι προσφέρει στον καθένα προσωπικά την ευτυχία ορισμένοι νιώθουν εγκλωβισμένοι σε ένα αδιέξοδο όπου αδυνατούν να υποστηρίξουν τις πραγματικές τους επιθυμίες (κάτι που ίσχυε μάλιστα σε μεγαλύτερο βαθμό σε προγενέστερες εποχές). Οι περισσότεροι εντέλει συμβιβάζονται και ενίοτε νιώθουν ευτυχισμένοι υιοθετώντας τελικά το μοντέλο ευτυχίας που οι άλλοι κατασκεύασαν γι’ αυτούς. Η Πλαθ προσπάθησε, όμως δεν τα κατάφερε. Ο γυάλινος Κώδων κατάφερε τελικά να την κλείσει μέσα του και να την οδηγήσει στην αυτοχειρία ως μοναδική διέξοδο στις αναζητήσεις της. Στο βιβλίο της, από την άλλη, μας αφήνει με την ελπίδα.. 	Προσωπικά, μέσα από περιγραφές που μου έκοβαν την ανάσα μου η συγγραφέας μου έδωσε αυτό ακριβώς που είχα ανάγκη ως αναγνώστρια: να βυθιστώ στον κόσμο και στην ψυχή της και να προσπαθήσω να δώσω τις δικές μου απαντήσεις. Εύχομαι να γνώριζε ότι δεν είναι η μόνη. Εύχομαι να ήξερε ότι καθημερινά πολλοί προσπαθούν να κάνουν ακριβώς το ίδιο. Απλά συνειδητοποιούν ότι ‘’αυτή η είναι η ζωή’’ και πορεύονται σε αυτή ξεκλέβοντας στιγμές χαράς, ως εφόδιο για να συνεχίσουν να αντέχουν..  Δεν ξέρω αν λυπάμαι που δεν πρόλαβε να εκδώσει και άλλα υπέροχα μυθιστορήματα γιατί νομίζω ότι ήδη είπε πολλά μέσα από αυτό. Σίγουρα όμως την ευχαριστώ γι’ αυτό το υπέροχο ‘’δώρο’’ που μας άφησε φεύγοντας.."

She talks about herself and her speech is absolutely universal and current. Maybe that's why the book turns out to be a real gem. The author's question about the meaning of life and its constraints becomes, slowly and inevitably, ours! In a hotel in New York for only women, Esther, nineteen, brilliant schoolgirl, winner of a stay offered by a fashion magazine, begins to feel ""like a racehorse in a world without tracks"". Around her, above her is the ruthless, bourgeois and mccarthyist America of the 50s. An alienated world, a real bell jar that crushes the protagonist under the weight of its protection, gradually removing the air. The alternative will be to indulge in the sweet charm of death or be invaded by the blue waves of electric shock. Sylvia was a most unique rose with the toughest of thorns, a rose no one should have ever dared to gather without the softest velvety gloves.That no one should have ever dared to gather at all.I wish I could have known her.

I took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart : I am, I am, I am (alive). Esther's bell jar is our bubble. Esther was trapped in a bell jar of confusion and it got in the way of the success she had perceived for herself.  The Bell Jar is the story of Esther's descent into depression told from her perspective and is thus, harrowing.But it's wonderful how Sylvia Plath made Ester go lyrical even in such a vulnerable state of being. The book is an interplay of emotions and norms presented using analogies that gave me a lot to reflect on. Nothing that Esther achieved mattered to her because she wasn't content within and her toxic productivity dragged her into depression. The Bell Jar is an important work of feminist literature and was banned just because the protagonist couldn't reason with the necessity to fit into the roles society had dictated for women. The Bell Jar is a coming of age story of a young woman burdened with more than her fair share of anguish. Parts of it read like a mental health memoir and because the author's own depression and death shadowed this work, it felt like her last cry for help."

Sylvia Plath masterfully draws the reader into Esther's breakdown with such intensity that Esther's insanity becomes completely real and even rational, as probable and accessible an experience as going to the movies. Such deep penetration into the dark and harrowing corners of the psyche is an extraordinary accomplishment and has made The Bell Jar a haunting American classic. Some reviewers have stated that the story is somewhat autobiographical in that the author had been going through similar things in her life."

I am honestly blown away and that is a rare and precious find in a book. I connected with the main character fast and at an intensity it almost hurt. The only other times I’ve felt this is with ‘a little life’ and ‘the goldfinch’. I must admit I do have a love of dark academia prose. Something about them connects so deeply with my soul. It almost frightens me, although in a sense it could be said I have a dark side to my complex and damaged mind. There’s something that spending almost a year in a mental hospital does to a person…anyhow I cannot praise this book enough. It had all the harrowing of ‘a little life’ but squeezed into 244 pages; now that takes talent! Don’t get me wrong I utterly LOVE both books but it is incredible the way different authors work to portray similar outcomes. There is so much to be gained from this book but I will share just one piece of the wisdom that stood out to me:“I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig-tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor….(the list goes on)….and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn’t quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig-tree, starving to death, just because I couldn’t make up my mind which of the figs to choose.

270,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5960716-mala,Rating 4 out of 5,"    I took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart. I am, I am, I am.Sylvia Plath is one of the doyens of confessional poetry –The Bell Jar, her semi-autobiographical novel, falls into the same category. It's written with an emotional honesty that makes one gasp. Plath wrote it ""in order to free (herself)from the past"" & to show""how isolated a person feels when he is suffering a break down.""To the person in the bell jar, blank and stopped as a dead baby, the world itself is a bad dream. It's never easy to read about mental illness- how tortuous then to write about it!DFW took recourse to high irony in The Depressed Person- Plath describes her character's ordeal with a light touch, airily, matter-of-factly with wry humour as if it were nothing- but the long drawn out, sad spectacle of self pity & suicide attempts left me exhausted, emotionally wrung out.The very opening page with its ominous reference to the Rosenberg executions, not only sets the time frame but also the major theme – the lurking build up of Esther Greenwood's nervous breakdown behind the glamarous facade of a month-long New York stint as a student guest editor in a fashion magzine:It was my first big chance, but here I was, sitting back and letting it run through my fingers like so much water.Yet it's hard to pin down the reason for this sudden unravelling:The one thing I was good at was winning scholarships and prizes, and that era was coming to an end.Is it the pressure that every high achiever feels- to consistently deliver the goods?Again DFW's parallel comes to mind- as a student he suffered the same  breakdowns, suicide attempts, and hospitalizations & yet passed his double honours summa cum laude, ditto with Plath. One often wonders, whether their brilliance/creativity came from the same dark place as the suffering!But Bell Jar is not just a memoir of mental illness, it is also a social commentary on the 1950s America: the expected gender roles that Esther finds so stifling; the limited choice of being a wife & mother & an English major with knowledge of shorthand & typing!That’s one of the reasons I never wanted to get married. The last thing I wanted was infinite security and to be the place an arrow shoots off from. I wanted change and excitement and to shoot off in all directions myself, like the colored arrows from a Fourth of July rocket.The sexual revolution of the sixties was far off, yet ""fitted out"" Esther feels like her own woman! The whole dating scene & the pressure to (ahem ahem) lose virginity sound so quaint in today's America but these ideas still find resonance in traditional society like an Indian one.After finishing the book, I read her Ariel poems again & was struck by how many ideas & images from The Bell Jar find expression there! Do read those poems to fully appreciate Sylvia's beautiful though tortured mind.The myth of the Sylvia Suicide Doll:I had seen 'Sylvia' when it came out & liked it (if 'liked' is the right word here), with an earnest Gwyneth Paltrow & a then lesser known Daniel Craig as Ted Hughes (dark & brooding in a Byronic fashion), & I wasn't any clear to the source of her sorrow then as now - here was a woman, desirable in every way - bright as a penny, creative, good-looking & yet suffering from such insecurity & low self-esteem that she was continually harsh on herself & consequently on others as well.Yes there were reasons - post-partum depression, her fragile mental & physical health, the breakup of her marriage, the alleged ( but never proven) sexual abuse in her childhood, the pressure of not only being a single mother but also a writer/poet.Says Lois Ames :  The conflict between the life style of a poet/intellectual and that of a wife and mother became a central preoccupation, and she wrote ""...it's quite amazing how I've gone around for most of my life as in the rarefied atmosphere under a bell jar.I leave you with these lines from Lady Lazarus that never fail to move me:""Dying Is an art, like everything else. I do it exceptionally well. I do it so it feels like hell. I do it so it feels real. I guess you could say I've a call. It's easy enough to do it in a cell. It's easy enough to do it and stay put. It's the theatrical Comeback in broad day To the same place, the same face, the same brute Amused shout: 'A miracle!' That knocks me out. There is a charge For the eyeing my scars, there is a charge For the hearing of my heart--- It really goes. And there is a charge, a very large charge For a word or a touch Or a bit of blood Or a piece of my hair on my clothes. So, so, Herr Doktor. So, Herr Enemy. I am your opus, I am your valuable, The pure gold baby That melts to a shriek. I turn and burn. Do not think I underestimate your great concern. Ash, ash--- You poke and stir. Flesh, bone, there is nothing there---- A cake of soap, A wedding ring, A gold filling. Herr God, Herr Lucifer Beware Beware. Out of the ash I rise with my red hair And I eat men like air.""And 50 years from her death, I still say what a waste, what a waste! Last time I felt that for Amy Winehouse."

It was an interesting perspective at what it was like to have depression in the 50's and I enjoyed the writing a lot. The best thing about this book is Esther herself. She seemed very real (which isn't surprising seeing as how the book is semi-autobiographical) and she was a likeable & relatable character. I liked her sense of humour and her overall disposition too. The other characters weren't really that fleshed out but I didn't mind because this book is about Esther. The next best thing about the book was the writing. I really enjoyed it. I thought she had some amazing imagery, similes and metaphors. I have such a hard time describing how I feel and when someone compares their feelings to something so accurately, it blows me away. I found a lot of Esther's inner-monologue relatable and the bits that weren't relatable, were extremely interesting. I felt like the story got lost a bit in the middle and it lost me a little bit. Things were sort of muddled and all over the place. What's interesting though is when I have my big depressive episodes, things get muddled and all over the place too. While I was reading it, I wasn't really enjoying it as much as I was enjoying it at the start but then when I thought about it, I realised that it was actually very accurate and it just shows how real this book is. Plus Esther herself was all muddled in the middle too. Overall, I did enjoy this. I'm not completely satisfied giving this a 3.5 star rating but I think it's the closest to satisfied that I will get. This one is a hard one to rate. I would recommend this and I would read other works by Sylvia Plath. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~“(I felt very still and very empty, the way the eye of a tornado must feel, moving dully along in the middle of the surrounding hullabaloo.)”“It was my first big chance, but here I was, sitting back and letting it run through my fingers like so much water.”“It’s like watching Paris from an express caboose heading in the opposite direction—every second the city gets smaller and smaller, only you feel it’s really you getting smaller and smaller and lonelier and lonelier, rushing away from all those lights and that excitement at about a million miles an hour.”“I wondered why I couldn’t go the whole way doing what I should any more. This made me sad and tired. Then I wondered why I couldn’t go the whole way doing what I shouldn’t, the way Doreen did, and this made me even sadder and more tired.”“For the first time in my life... I felt dreadfully inadequate. The trouble was, I had been inadequate all along, I simply hadn’t thought about it.”“I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn’t make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.”“As the houses grew more familiar, I slunk still lower.I felt it was very important not to be recognized.”“Inertia oozed like molasses through Elaine’s limbs. That’s what it must feel like to have malaria, she thought.”“But when it came right down to it, the skin of my wrist looked so white and defenseless that I couldn’t do it. It was as if what I wanted to kill wasn’t in that skin or the thin blue pulse that jumped under my thumb, but somewhere else, deeper, more secret, and a whole lot harder to get at.”“I wanted to tell her that if only something were wrong with my body it would be fine, I would rather have anything wrong with my body than something wrong with my head,”“If Mrs. Guinea had given me a ticket to Europe, or a round-the-world cruise, it wouldn’t have made one scrap of difference to me, because wherever I sat—on the deck of a ship or at a street café in Paris or Bangkok—I would be sitting under the same glass bell jar, stewing in my own sour air.”“I hated these visits, because I kept feeling the visitors measuring my fat and stringy hair against what I had been and what they wanted me to be, and I knew they went away utterly confounded.”"

I cannot begin to explain how I feel about it. I am extremely confused.Sylvia Plath has been my undisputed literary muse eversince my eyes first took in her words. Reading her journals was like reading about all that I felt and experienced told through the words of the most eloquent writer I had ever had the pleasure to read. That made me so anxious! I revered those quotes, I knew that Sylvia like I knew mylself, what if I read her actual published work and didn't like it? It seemed so important.So I started with her poetry, and read Ariel, was blown away, and confirmed my love for her.But for some reason I always felt anxiety over The Bell Jar, I don't know why. Now that I finally decided to read it, I don't really know how to review it. Was it good? Yup. Special? Sure. But was it mind-blowing like the other stuff I read by her? No...There were a couple of things that bothered me. Her vivid characterization was there, but not all the way through. There was a character indicated merely as ""The Negro"" in a chapter, and that would have been bad enough, had she not hammered it into oblivion, announcing him as ""The Negro"" a total of nine times in the span of two measly pages.I thought there would be a clear before and after The Bell Jar in my life. That's how anticipated this book was for me. However, I still don't know why people tattoo the quote ""I am, I am, I am,"" on their skin. I thought after reading the book I'd be in on the secret. But I still don't get it. Because to me it felt like her heartbeat mocked her while it sounded ""I am, I am, I am!"", and in the end it still did not seem like she wanted it to continue sounding its assurances. Maybe I missed something, and maybe I’m just being a pessimist, but that's how it translated to me.Overall, Sylvia did not let me down, of course. I still adore her. I guess she's just a bit more human now."

When she returns home to Massachusetts, she spirals into despair and depression, unable to sleep or write or eat. While on the outside it might look like Esther has everything going for her in life, inside she feels like a bell jar had descended over her, she has a nervous breakdown, and attempts to end her life. Her experiences at various mental hospitals, when psychiatry was not very advanced, are related to us.The book is known to be a semi-autobiographical account of Sylvia Plath's own life. She absolutely sucks the reader into her world with her account of what it is like going through a mental breakdown. Amazingly, she is able to make her account occasionally witty while writing about the scariness of mental illness. Perhaps Sylvia Plath's emotional makeup led her to feel and reflect about life much more deeply than the average person. While that gave beauty and genius to her writing, it also drove her to despair.This book ends with the author's release from the mental hospital. In thinking what lay ahead she says, ""All I could see were question marks."" That sent chills through me because she did eventually commit suicide in 1963."

“The silence depressed me. It wasn't the silence of silence. It was my own silence.”
I hated this book. But that doesn't mean it was bad. In fact, it was really, really good. The author was really good at what she wrote. I felt those words. I literally felt sad and depressed after reading this book. But that, for me, wasn't a great thing. But I like books that can make me feel something. So yes, I loved it anyway."
277,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5687551-josh-caporale,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5 starsI never thought I would be reading as much from Sylvia Plath as I am reading now. I was introduced to her through the Confessional Poetry unit that summed up my American Literature II class and she was certainly over the top with the way she conveyed herself. I did not like her poems ""Daddy"" and Lady Lazarus"" by any means, for I felt that she was taking sympathy from people that were in far worse situations than hers. I have expressed my distaste for both of these poems on Literary Gladiators against the opposing views of the others on the panel and, sure enough, these episodes received strong viewership. This led me to incorporate a Sylvia Plath work on each season and I have realized that ""Cut"" and ""Tulips"" were quite fascinating in their nature, especially with how ""Tulips"" presents the point of view of being in an institution. It has also been cited as the point where Plath's writing became dark and what Ted Hughes described as what ""was the first sign of what was on its way"" (from a biographical note by Lois Ames).Then I decided to approach The Bell Jar. This is the only novel that Sylvia Plath has written and is deemed as one of the closest views we can get of Plath's very own struggles and this, perhaps, would help us learn more about why she was the way she was. While the struggles of Esther Greenwood run a few parallels to Plath's very own life, this is still a work of fiction that takes a different direction to some capacity. Esther starts out in New York City engaged in a summer internship at Ladies Day magazine. She is also involved in plenty of evening festivities that she does not seem to enjoy as much as the others, not to mention a more ""off the beaten path"" outlook of her surroundings. She also looks back on her relationship with Buddy Willard, who wants to become a doctor and marry a woman that will take on traditional, womanly attributes and duties (which Esther does not possess), but life's circumstances cause Buddy to change his course and this creates a strain between Esther and Buddy's relationship.Upon returning to Massachusetts to stay with her mother and engage in the opportunities that await while she is there, things begin to fall through for Esther and she begins to enter a state of depression that turns into a loss of her sanity that requires medical care. Throughout the novel, we follow Esther through her inconsistent state of affairs and how one moment things are calm and sound and in the next, things start to tick and she is required to stay at an even more restricted institution. With the story being told from Esther's first person account, we follow her along through the moments of her life and the struggles that take place within this life of hers.The Bell Jar was a somewhat complicated reading experience, which I feel it is supposed to be. Esther is not the most reliable narrator to say the very least in where she leaves out specific details regarding how she gets from one point to the next, which I feel is primarily intended, though it leaves us with an execution that creates a slight strain on me the reader. The execution in general can be a bit burdensome in my and other people's experience in reading this novel. There are also plenty of moments that lead me to think, ""why the heck did she just do THAT?"" Some of the inconsistencies come with the deterioration of one's mental state, but the way in which it was conveyed could have been a little less blurry. HOWEVER, I think that this is a novel that I will continue to think about and there is a lot to explore and talk about within the text. It is challenging to pinpoint technicalities within this text, for I feel it was not Plath's priority in putting forth this novel that was essentially telling her story on a fictional canvas. I think that if Plath's intent was to make you think beyond the text for any given reason, then I think she succeeded. If you want to learn more about mental conditions, insanity, the deterioration of the mind, and are looking for something different, this is a book for you. If you want something organized, consistent, and reliable, this is by no means the book you should be reading. This definitely tied my brain up in a few knots, but I would not expect any less from Sylvia Plath.You can find the Literary Gladiators discussion about this book (containing spoilers) here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clJWq..."

""I felt dull and flat and full of shattered visions.""
➜I think the first thing you have to know about this book is that it talks about topics that can be triggering, so a trigger warning for Suicide attempts and depression (because I sure wasn’t prepared fully, I knew it would talk about this but not be this graphic). Especially for the people who are suffering or had suffered from depression in the past, please don’t read this book unless you are mentally doing well.➜This book was very immersive for me to read. The first part; Esther in New York pulled me in, the writing style was so beautiful, every passage felt vivid, real. By the fifth chapter, I almost felt like I was Esther myself, on a writing internship in New York feeling lost with where I am going with life.
""There must be quite a few things a hot bath won’t cure, but I don’t know many of them. Whenever I’m sad I’m going to die, or so nervous I can’t sleep, or in love with somebody I won’t be seeing for a week, I slump down just so far and then I say: “I’ll go take a hot bath.”* *""I lay in that tub on the seventeenth floor of this hotel for-women-only, high up over the jazz and push of New York, for near onto an hour, and I felt myself growing pure again. I don’t believe in baptism or the waters of Jordan or anything like that, but I guess I feel about a hot bath the way those religious people feel about holy water.""
➜There is a slow depiction of Esther’s depression, gradually slipping further and further away. It’s scary, especially for people who have been depressed (I have, not to the point Esther was, but I was doing really bad mentally for half a year back in 2018), you can recognize the pattern and see what comes next.

""I saw the days of the year stretching ahead like a series of bright, white boxes, and separating one box from another was sleep, like a black shade. Only for me, the long perspective of shades that set off one box from the next had suddenly snapped up, and I could see day after day after day glaring ahead of me like a white, broad, infinitely desolate avenue.It seemed silly to wash one day when I would only have to wash again the next.It made me tired just to think of it.I wanted to do everything once and for all and be through with it. ""

➜Esther is a character to who I related a lot, her confusion, sadness and her thoughts on marriage and children, her feminism, all of these traits are close to my character. 
""That’s one of the reasons I never wanted to get married. The last thing I wanted was infinite security and to be the place an arrow shoots off from. I wanted ‘change and excitement and to shoot off in all directions myself, like the colored arrows from a Fourth of July rocket.""
I’m not going to write the famous fig-tree quote, although I have always liked it(and figs haha) but I will say that my edition of The Bell jar has a lot of quotes underlined. I wish Sylvia Plath wrote more prose fiction, because goddamn.➜All in all, I really liked the book and connected with it a lot. Probably going to reread it sometime in the future, 5/5.-----------------------------------Wow...just wow. Review to come."

Esa autora de la que siempre he oído hablar; esa mujer de la que supe antes sobre su muerte que sobre su vida. Esa mujer, que con su escritura ha inspirado a tantas otras mujeres. Desconfiada y anhelante, decidí empezar por “La campana de crista”, una obra que me era desconocida más allá del hedor lúgubre que la sociedad ha creado entorno a este libro, entorno a ella. Y no sé qué habría pensando al leerlo a los dieciséis años; probablemente habría encontrado entre sus páginas a una compañera de viaje en una época oscura, depresiva y difícil de mi vida. Lo que sí sé es la gran lectura que he podido padecer y disfrutar estos días, dándole la mano, cálida entre este gélido ambiente, a Sylvia Plath.“La campana de cristal” es una obra semiautobiográfica en la que conocemos a Esther Greenwood, el alter ego de la propia Plath, que no está dividida en dos partes y que sin embargo yo me empeño en dividir. En la primera mitad conocemos a una mujer en cierta forma independiente, que no anhela una vida matrimonial, sino la libertad; y con su ironía y gracia veremos la vida de una mujer en los años cincuenta muy entretenida, bien narrada, y con un toque de humor muy característico. A partir de la segunda mitad todo cambia, su sueño de ser escritora, truncado por la negativa a entrar un curso en la universidad, la hacen sumirse en una situación que muchas de nosotras hemos podido vivir; ¿qué hago con mi vida? ¿A dónde voy? ¿Quién soy? Volcada sobre todas estas reflexiones, y dejada por la depresión que ya habitaba en ella, termina interna en un hospital psiquiátrico donde todo se oscurece y se pudre.Esta obra narra, con asombrosa sinceridad, el proceso por el cual pasa una persona que tiene pulsiones suicidas. El pensar constante de como hacerlo para que sea final, perfecto. Esa obsesión con no dejar resquicios a la vida. La tranquilidad para engañar y planificar cada uno de los pasos, o la simple idea tranquilizadora de pensar en ellos. “La campana de cristal” es un libro ejemplar para tratar, sin trabas, mitos o tabús algo que se tiene tan silenciado como son los impulsos suicidas, que pasan, que están ahí. Siempre digo que no hablar sobre algo, silenciarlo, no hace que ese algo deje de existir. Y esto es aplicable a las personas con pulsiones suicidas; se podrán superar, o no, con el tiempo, pero evitar hablar de ello no es bueno para nadie. Plath habla también de la terrible “terapia” de electroshocks a la que la sometieron y las consecuencias de la misma, el miedo paralizante, el no entendimiento del maltrato a un cuerpo. Todas aquellas cosas que sabemos que han pasado dentro de centros destinados a la curación de la salud.Sylvia Plath me ha parecido una escritora magnífica, pero sobre todo una mujer muy interesante. No tardaré en leer sus diarios, sus cartas… todo aquello que caiga en mis manos."

Σκεφτόμουν λοιπόν πόσο διαφορετικά διαβάζουμε τα βιβλία σε κάθε ηλικιακή μας περίοδο. Και θα εξηγήσω γιατί. Η ηρωίδα είναι μια νεαρή ταλαντούχα ύπαρξη που πέφτει σε βαθιά και βαρι�� κατάθλιψη ουσιαστικά όταν έρχεται αντιμέτωπη με την πραγματικότητα, με τη ζωή γενικά, αλλά και τη ζωή πιο ειδικά ως γυναίκα που ήταν και είναι κάποια τσικ πιο πολύπλοκα δύσκολη. Θεωρώ ότι πολλοί άνθρωποι μπορούμε να ταυτιστούμε με αυτό, γιατί οι περισσότεροι αν όχι όλοι έχουμε αυτή την ανάγκη να διαφέρουμε, να αναγνωριστούμε, κάποιος να μας ξεχωρίζει και να μας πει πόσο έξυπνοι, όμορφοι, ιδιαίτεροι, λαμπεροί, ταλαντούχοι είμαστε. Αλλά. Εδώ μου σκάει και αυτή η φοβερή φράση του Φράνζεν στην Ελευθερία: ""nothing disturbs the feeling of specialness like the presence of other human beings feeling identically special"".

Πλησιάζοντας τα 40, γνωρίζοντας πολύ καλά ότι ξυπνήσω δεν ξυπνήσω ο κόσμος θα γυρίσει, ζώντας βέβαια και κάποιες δεκαετίες αργότερα όπου η γυναίκα αρχίζει να επιβάλλει τη δυναμική της, συμπονώ την Έσθερ, θέλω να της κάνω πατ πατ και να της πω ότι όχι, τίποτα δεν θα πάει καλύτερα, απλά εσύ πρέπει να βρεις τρόπους να ξεχνιέσαι, όλα καλά, κάποια στιγμή όλοι πεθαίνουμε, ιτσοκέι.

To je otprilike osećaj sa kojim komentarišem Stakleno zvono.Ako odvajamo piščev život od njegovog dela, a jedino tako je, mislim, pravično, ovaj roman Silvije Plat je tek korektan. Naprosto, u malo šta je uspela da me uveri. Pre-opisala je, kao kad glumac preglumi ulogu, i tako istinski užas štreberski svela na gole činjenice, na intrigante, ali ipak faktografske podatke u filigranskom povezu. Izvesno joj je veoma stalo da bude shvaćena ali je, previše se trudeći da to osigura, previše uglancala, nekako previše namotala, previše išmirglala agoniju. Podgrevala je santu jeze naivnom slikovitošću – u nameri da zaštiti čitaoca, hajde da verujemo – i postigla utisak tek bezazlenog kondenza, jedva barice. Bez ostatka mi je jasno da (najmanje) takav i jeste odnos jedne krhke duše pred mukama ove magnitude i da su joj borbeni izgledi upravo takvi, ali Silvija to saopštava nekako deklamatorski, kao da je više guši trema od javnog nastupa nego ono zbog čega je stala na binu. U kontekstu potonjih događaja – šah mat, ali, koliko god bezdušna ova izjava bila, smatram da taj kontekst nije bitan, osim ako se ne želi raspravljati pro i contra suicida, preko genetskog kodiranja takvih ideja, sve do pitanja neumitnosti sudbine.

I've fallen back into a slump, and things that I start are taking me AGES to actually finish. I started listening to this audiobook during my drive back from July's bookclub meeting, but wasn't actually intending to read the book then... it was just on my Audible app and something to listen to at the time. So I didn't even add it to my Currently Reading shelf, which is my MUST-DO process for tracking my reads. Anyway, so it wasn't officially something I was reading, but I made it through a big chunk of it... and then during August's (and coincidentally my last) book club meeting that wasn't (sigh) drive, I finished listening to it. And afterward, I realized that it's a book in two parts, and with all of the other wrongness regarding how I approached and consumed this book, I realized after finishing that I had unintentionally split my drive-reads along the fault line in the book, which would be impressive skill, had I actually tried to do it that way. That's a weird opening to this review, and probably doesn't even make sense. Nothing I do makes sense anymore. OK. Let me back up. I have had The Bell Jar on my TBR for... over a decade. But I never got around to it. I didn't know anything about Sylvia Plath except that she wrote poetry and had killed herself. I'm no poetry fan, so that didn't exactly have me beating down the bookstore doors to get my hands on her work, and the suicide was... I dunno. Not unimportant, but just... I didn't really know how it was relevant to her writing. Well, of course, NOW I do. Because that's what reading is for! Wait... still getting ahead of myself. So I have had this on my ""One-Day-I-Should-Read-This"" shelf for years and years, but with no real plan of reading it, until I signed up for a reading challenge that offered bonus points for blowing the dust off of one's ancient TBR books and actually reading them. So, when I got some Audible cred (I'm so cool), I picked it up, and figured that I could probably do a bit worse than listening to Maggie Gyllenhaal read to me for a while, instead of reading the kindle version which would probably languish on my night table for the next decade. So, going into this without really knowing anything about what this not-poetry novel would be about, other than a vague ""mental illness"" theme, I was initially not loving it. AT ALL. In fact, I was ready to shut it down and return it to Audible and delete it from the kindle and leave a gaping crater where the file once was after less than an hour of listening... but the ONLY reason I stuck with it was because I was stuck in the car already and didn't feel like stopping the car just to find something else to take up space in the silence. (I have music, yes, but if I'm in the car alone for more than an hour, it's audiobook time. Otherwise I feel like I've wasted that time.)So, why was I ready to set fire to my kindle and suchlike? Read on! But, umm, probably spoilery shit ahead. Be warned. The book opens with young (18-19 year old?) Esther and her friend Doreen going out to an event with some friends that they obviously think they are too cool for, then ditching their lame plans for a RANDOM STRANGER WHO WALKS UP TO THEIR TAXI IN TRAFFIC AND INVITES THEM FOR DRINKS. Esther decides to call herself ""Elly"", and Doreen goes along with it, because sure, why not? Then they go back to RANDOM TRAFFIC PICK UP ARTIST'S house, where Esther's friend proceeds to get drunk and all sorta frisky with RANDOM TRAFFIC PICK UP ARTIST STRANGER THAT THEY DON'T KNOW ISN'T A RAPIST MURDERER... and then Esther gets bored and ghosts her friend, leaving Doreen alone with the MAYBE RAPIST MURDERER GUY. THEN, because of course there's a THEN, when Doreen is brought back to E's dorm at 3am or 4am or whatever, blackout drunk and needing help, Esther does the bare minimum, and essentially ghosts her again afterward. She has moved on from Doreen, and that's all there is to it. And I was like... And I immediately did not like Esther Greenwood. Because, sure, her friend is probably fake and backstabby and catty, but seriously, what. the. fuck. That is NOT okay.But then that is just... it. The book, Esther and her friend, continue on as normal. Friendo even starts DATING the guy. So all's well and good in the free and easy 60s, I guess. But my modern Woman Safety Internal Alarm System was ringing like crazy, and it made me anxious and uncomfortable and on edge for a good chunk of the book, because I was waiting for the other shoe to drop, for the repercussions of that night to come about. But it never did. It simply never came up again. This book, via Esther, exists entirely in its own present. It doesn't dwell or reflect on the past. It just is what it is at the moment. Characters move in and out of the story, and when they are relevant, they are there, and when they are not, they just no longer exist. Decisions are made, dreams and aspirations are vitally important one minute, but cast aside the next for a newer, shinier, more glamorous something. It's self-exploratory, in a kind of way that lacks insight, but is insightful despite that. It just is what it is. (Read that not in the trite, dismissive way that people use the phrase ""it is what it is"", but as a statement of fact. OK thanks!) The slide into the mental illness part of this book was startling in its subtlety. It was there from the very beginning, but it's only in hindsight that one can see it. Take for instance the previously mentioned WTF scene I outlined. That's obviously fucked up and completely unsafe and abnormal (and don't tell me it's not) and sure, one could argue that the 60s were a new era of feminism and freedom for women, and that there was probably no reason to expect that the guy was unsafe. But throughout history, we have known men, and feared them. And the fact that Esther's only thought was for her own lack of fun at this ""party"" should have been a tip off to me that she was living in a different reality inside her own head. It could be, simply, that she imagined that the identity she had assumed that night, Elly, wasn't the type to hang around if she was bored, and so she didn't. Who knows? Certainly not me. Maybe not even Esther. We live in E's head, and we're along for the ride with her, but that doesn't mean we know where she's going. We're just there to witness her struggle to reconcile who she is with who she thinks she is and who she wants to be, while she tries to make a place for herself, when she tries to remake herself to fit into a place she thinks exists, or should exist, or she thinks that people think she should exist in, even if it's diametrically opposed to the life she envisions for herself, whatever that is from moment to moment. We are with her when she asserts herself, when she is consistent, when she's anything but, when she has moments of clarity and self-inspection, and when she fails at everything, even giving up. I initially did not like the 60s intern-slash-party girl stuff. Her work - the superficialness of it, her fakeness, her way of being different with different people grated on my nerves. But then, after she really starts falling apart, and we get into her complete lethargy and withdrawal and her inability to see the point in anything that must be repeatedly done for upkeep and maintenance of life, it was such a drastic change, that I found myself, shitty as it is, wanting her to just TRY. And yet, at the same time, really identifying with the ideas and thoughts themselves. And then realizing that that's exactly the point. Mental illness doesn't come with instructions or specifics or check-boxes. It affects us all differently, and while I may be able to have these kinds of futility thoughts and still function (mostly) normally, someone else may be completely thwarted by them. I was quite disturbed by the sexism and misogyny displayed in this book, particularly when it came to E's treatment for her mental illness. It reminded me quite strongly of the portrayal of ""care"" depicted in Requiem For A Dream, which I believe took place (at least if one assumes that it is supposed to be contemporary to when it was published) nearly 2 decades later. We can make leaps and bounds of progress in science and technology, but to get humans to see other, slightly different humans as just ALSO human, progress is sluggish. I didn't realize that this book was a sort of fictionalized auto-biography. I thought it was a straight up novel in which the author writes from experience, but the writing itself is a complete fiction. Now knowing (from the afterword) that it was not JUST that, it adds a depth and urgency to the book that I don't think it would have had otherwise. The ending, the title, everything gains new meaning. Also, there's a bit of a meta quality, which I liked, wherein the author wrote about a fictionalized version of herself writing a fictionalized version of HERself. Though in the end, that was just a passing whim, as so much Esther thought and did was. How much of that quality was true to the author as well, I'm not sure, but I would guess not quite as much as she gave to Esther - considering that we actually have Plath's writing in hand. It's strange to me how much my appreciation for this book changed based on how ill Esther was. Before we really see her mental health issues manifesting, I found her profoundly unlikeable, and could not identify with her at all. But as she started her decline, I started to empathize and root for her to succeed in her treatment and recover, as much as that is possible - even though her marker for success is to get back to the person she was... which is the person I thought I'd disliked quite a lot. But that just goes to show that understanding and empathy are key. We never know what someone is going through. It's a good lesson to be reminded of. I think that, in the end, this is a book that needs to be read and re-read to fully appreciate it. Just thinking about it over the past couple days, my opinions have shifted several times, and I think that on re-read, I would get so much more out of it. I probably would read the text the next time though. Not that Maggie Gyllenhaal wasn't great, but I think I would like Esther to speak directly to me, instead of through an interpreter."
294,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,Rating 5 out of 5,"A bell jar is a piece of laboratory equipment used to contain vacuum. It's a clear glass jar made to be airless. A hose can be connected and the air is pumped out. A famous classroom experiment is to have inside the glass jar an alarm clock which is ringing as the air is pumped out. As the air disappears, you can't hear the alarm clock. If you are inside, perhaps, you can't really feel the world, it can't be touched or experienced except as distant thunder. You are trapped inside, distressed, ringing with sensory deprivation. And no matter how hard you try, all you can feel is the glass wall, not the wind, not touching people, not tasting food. Everything you see is distorted by the glass. It would be similar to being in an isolation tank. The title, I think, is about Esther's condition, a clue. She KNEW it was her brain, not the world and the things that happen. Her mental illness was causing a kind of disassociation, along with the distorted perceptions.The book seems to be a Rorschach test of sorts to readers. Some who I suspect do not have a clue about being permanently unbalanced think 'Esther Greenwood' is a crybaby. Some think the story disjointed - huh? Maybe they need to read it again straight through without interruptions. Others think she needs to toughen up or lighten up, or it's all boring. The worst inability to understand the book, I think, come from some readers who completely miss the fact Esther was almost raped, and she had to hide it, and most glaringly obvious of all, felt numb about it. She wasn't a libertine. She had one desire - to have experiences, adventures, to live. The first half of the book is about having those young adult adventures, which I believe to be common to most of us. Even though I grew up on the West Coast in the 1960's and 1970's, I found myself vibrating in tune with her baby-steps college life and grinning with remembrance (unlike Esther, I'm not going to tell the story about the first time I encountered a finger bowl!). Esther was amused by many things. - the nature of youth, people, men and women together, her errors of judgement and mistakes made - but I think what did her in was a total lack of resilience. I wish I knew where that gift of life comes from. I know I have it, and Esther didn't. If there is anything disjointed about this fictionalized autobiography, it's Esther's coming to terms with everything that happens. She's stuck at 'it happened'. Her failure at loving men who love her back, at making lasting connections, and at finding work she enjoys, devastates her. But the bell jar which encapsulates her silences her mind and senses. She's frozen in a mysterious vacuum of experience without process. Even when falling into various mud puddles of living, she feels virginal, untouched. The deep airless space of sadness surrounding her keeps her own enjoyment and sense of fun out there, and love is miles from her actual being, intellectually known, but she is emotionally numbed and insulated.She was a talented writer without luck or a famous family. At every turn, she was unable to get published, her other true tragedy, besides that of having an incurable mental illness, at the time. Instead, her mother advised learning shorthand (I was so advised, too, in 1968). Today, I think a Paxel-type pill would have helped her a great deal if it was depression, or something like. Of course, if it was schizophrenia, as some have suggested, she might have responded to some of the newer drugs. Either way, it doesn't seem she could fix this, if at all, without today's drugs. She had the kind of mental illness that comes from biochemical or wiring defects, not life experiences, I think. Crybaby? No. The book is disjointed, boring? No. She needed to toughen up or lighten up? Impossible with this type of mental illness, which is more about the brain than about the mind. I think the book is a literary treasure, a perfect description of living with a type of mental illness. Some readers pick up on her lack of options as a women's rights story, but I think in this case it's peripheral; however, it certainly was an issue, too. I can't see how having more respect or being taken more seriously would have helped her, though. So many people today who are talented and famous commit suicide still. If you have everything except resilience, you can remain a doomed person.I loved the writing, but Esther is a very sad case and this is a very depressing book. Given the time period of her suffering, I can't think of a time in American history more difficult to be mentally ill. Soldiers suffering from PTSD were being called out as cowards. Women, who had been building warships and weapons and plumbing, raising children alone, and making do with very little food in the stores, had been forced back into dresses and white gloves and little hats, housewife work, and manicuring lawns. When you married, you lost what little credit you may have possessed at the bank. You couldn't legally sign most contracts as a female, which means no woman could buy a house or car on credit. You even lost your name. Talk about 'the nanny state'. Men thought women were much lesser than themselves in all things. Women were either allowed the respect of uneducated scrubbers of toilets or put on pedestals, not recognized as beings that could scratch, fart or burp. Married people on TV slept in twin beds. But as Esther describes her psychiatric care in the second half of the novel I saw that she was respected by the doctors and worried about.For the ordinary person, at the time, being mentally ill was a case of moral weakness and a lack of personal fiber; and there was nothing more shameful than this to the general population. That perception is obvious from Esther's mom. I hate her, for the record. The others did not know how to help her. I think it was impossible without the proper medications we have today. The synapses of her brain didn't fire right - how could talk therapy or electric shock fix this?Regardless of the mental illness issue, the writing is superb. So many phrases to recall with thrills and chills. The lady WAS a great writer. "
295,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45393732-adora,Rating 5 out of 5,"“The silence depressed me. It wasn't the silence of silence. It was my own silence.”Before I talk about how much I like this book, I want to mention that there are a lot of instances of blatant racism from the main character and surrounding characters, which is obviously not okay. The Bell Jar is dated and in some ways doesn't hold up to today's standards. Anyway, I'm glad I read this while still a teenager. I don't know if it would've resonated with me as much if I was older. Maybe it would, who knows? Sylvia Plath captures the complicated feelings of being a teenage girl so well and its accuracy was uncomfortable at times. (That's not a critique, btw.) I annotated this book and highlighted a lot of the themes which included femininity, sexuality, identity, class, and the idea of purity vs. impurity. I think all of those things are relevant today, even though the book is almost sixty years old.Esther Greenwood, the main character, is a successful college student in New York City and is passionate about writing. When the novel starts, she's headed on a downward spiral and spends most of her time in a sullen state and contemplates death and the meaning of life, something she isn't able to find no matter how much she wants to. She descends into a state of madness that leads her to dissociate from her life and she attempts suicide multiple times. Esther obsesses over the concept of purity and likes to compare herself to others. She thinks she's better than other women because she's a virgin and that she'll have an easier time finding a husband because of it. ""Of course they would try to persuade a girl to have sex and say they would marry her later, but as soon as she gave in, they would lose all respect for her and start saying that if she did that with them she would do that with other men and they would end up by making her life miserable."" For a while, Esther is afraid of that happening to her, but she figures out that the same expectation is not put on men and decides she wants to lose her virginity before getting married. Her on and off boyfriend Buddy Willard makes her aware of this by insinuating that he's been with other women. When she ends up losing her virginity to someone she doesn't know, it's a kind of sacrifice as she's letting go of a virtue that has the power to determine her worth. This happens after she's been in the mental hospital and has accepted the reality of her mental illness. She's in a place where keeping up with societal expectations means less to her.Esther's cynicism and sulkiness aren't typical of nineteen-year-old girls at the time, and she's forced to disguise that part of her personality to please others and submit to societal expectations. She withdraws from others and her relationships are built on misunderstandings. She feels like she can never express her thoughts on typically taboo topics because she has to comply with everyone else.Death is also an overarching theme of the novel that is brought up a lot. Esther attempts to commit suicide multiple times but finds small, practical reasons not to go through with it and it isn't until her final attempt that we see her mental illness for how serious it really is. Her final attempt is with pills, and she goes to a crawl space in the basement where she's hopeful she won't be found until after she's dead. She's mostly nonchalant about it and talks about her suicide passively. At other times in the novel, she mentions random deaths she notices in newspapers and the death of her father, whom she was never allowed to properly mourn.As a character, Esther is selfish and rarely considers the feelings of the people around her, though part of this behavior can be attributed to her mental illness and lack of self-awareness. She has no idea who she is and is sometimes unrecognizable even to herself. Her narration is funny and she's actually a lot of fun to listen to. She monologues a lot about various nihilistic topics, but Sylvia Plath's writing is so engaging that it's not strenuous. Esther has so many weird, but often relatable thoughts floating around in her head.I was actually surprised by the ending. I thought that Esther might not make it out of the mental hospital, but was relieved when she did. She was still just as cynical at the end, but at least she knew that there was hope for her life. She had reasons to live and the people around her assured her of that. It was a hopeful ending that showed readers who might be feeling some of the things Esther felt that there are ways to get better, which would've been an important thing to hear in the sixties. If I was a teenager at the time, I'm sure this would've been an extremely important book to me. Mental health isn't as taboo of a topic anymore, but it wasn't like that when this was published.(People aren't lying when they say The Bell Jar is like the female companion to The Catcher in the Rye. Both Esther and Holden have scathing inner monologues.)"

This work is unnerving in its honesty and willingness to share the distressing details of a life that is running off the rails. The confusion and fear are palpable.There are tendencies towards depression that run through my family, and I have felt the cold fingers of depression laid on my forehead more than a few times. There, but for the grace of the universe, go I. It is a sobering thought.  Like Plath, I came as an inexperienced country girl to the city (though not nearly so large a city as New York). I had to find my way through the minefields of city life, university studies, social events, and eventually finding employment. Also like her, I could usually make high academic marks if I paid even a little bit of attention to a subject. Believe it or not, that is not helpful—someone who administered an aptitude test for me looked at the perfectly symmetrical marks that I had scored and said, “Oh my, you don’t know what you want to be when you grow up!” No kidding, that was why I was taking the blessed test! Like all the best oracles, it offered no certain advice. “You can go any direction you choose, but you will have to choose,” reported the tester. No help there with deciding where to aim myself; I might as well have consulted a fortune cookie.It’s hard to find good advice on life’s decisions: what employment would you enjoy, how will you know when you find a good life partner, is everyone else having as difficult a time as I am? We all have to manoeuver through them with minimal experience and hope for the best. I am grateful that I didn’t have to fight the black beast at the same time during that phase of my life. I appreciate the “female-ness” of this book—trying to deal with not being taken seriously as a potential employee, student, even as a patient. Knowing that you must appear “ladylike” in order to make a good impression and that your clothing choices can be more important that you are. The choices that we have to make around sexuality (especially back in the day when there was little reliable birth control available and women were still judged by their “purity”). The Bell Jar was written just as women were starting to strain against the straitjacket of the wife and mother role that they had been shoved into during the 1950s—Plath’s female voice seems startlingly honest for the time.The Bell Jar ends on what seems to me to be a hopeful note, stepping into the doctors’ office to be released from hospital. If only that feeling of hopefulness had held and Plath had been able to resist the pull of the grave—what might she have created?"

La lettura di questo libro è stata disturbante, a tratti claustrofobica. Ho dovuto prendermi delle pause in alcuni passaggi, perché mi ha provocato uno strano malessere. È un libro straordinario, ma piange dolore e sofferenza. Mi ha fatto sentire appesantita, tolto il respiro, dato i brividi. Per alcune cose, e molto da lontano, mi ha fatto sentire compresa; per altre, mi ha lasciato addosso una sensazione di inquietudine.La scrittura della Plath è incredibilmente fluida: non soltanto perché rende la lettura scorrevole, ma perché muta insieme ad Esther stessa. Le immagini che accompagnano il romanzo hanno una grandissima potenza emotiva ed era da tantissimo che non sentivo un trasporto così intenso. Esther non è un personaggio facile con cui empatizzare, a volte mi è risultata addirittura incomprensibile nei suoi atteggiamenti. Eppure, la maggior parte delle volte, non solo mi sono sentita vicina a Esther, ma mi sono addirittura sentita Esther.A pieno titolo tra i miei preferiti.""Vidi la mia vita protendere i suoi rami come il verde albero di fico del racconto.Dalla cima di ogni ramo, come un enorme fico purpureo, ammiccava e occhieggiava un futuro meraviglioso.

300,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41763158-jess,Rating 4 out of 5,"'Everything she said was like a secret voice speaking straight out of my own bones.'Plath speaks to me in a way that very few writers have ever managed to. I was mindful that I might find a fellow sufferer’s account triggering, but instead I was somewhat comforted by Plath’s ruthless stream of consciousness and waspish humour. It’s unsurprising given the highly autobiographical nature of the novel: she understands. The Bell Jar is a startlingly clear exposé of depression, the pressures of academia and gender expectations. I think we understand each other, Sylvia and me.This depiction of mental illness, or ‘insanity’ as it was so bluntly termed in the 60s, is as exquisite as it is disturbing. Plath’s voice is unparalleled in its bitterness, wit and originality. In the hands of less capable writers, mental illness can sometimes be glamourized or simplified whilst sufferers can be thoroughly misconstrued, sometimes damagingly so (Michelle Hodkin, I am looking at you), but Esther’s story is so startlingly accurate, it makes her actions and decisions feel almost rational. In this way Plath emulates so well how a mental health condition can completely envelop a person and obscure their judgement. I found this incredibly intense - but I can’t attribute that sentiment entirely to the novel alone. My prior knowledge of Plath’s life (namely her suicide by asphyxiation) rendered this exceptionally vivid for me in a way that it probably wouldn’t have been had I not always known that it was drawn from personal experience. Nevertheless, to read a first hand experience of mental ‘therapy’ in the 1960s, especially shock therapy, was absolutely terrifying... and yet simultaneously fascinating.This stunning piece is testimony to Plath’s exceptional ability to transmute traumatic experiences into new, lyrical formats which also have the power to give a poignant insight into a condition that can be so difficult to describe. Astounding."

I found it disconcerting, not knowing which parts to accept as reality and which parts to see as her perception of reality. The disconnect between her life in New York and the rest of the book is clear, and points to the beginnings of the moving toward irreconcilable madness.Isn't it strange how even in a disturbing book such as this, there can be feminist themes? Here is an interesting quote:“I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn’t quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn’t make up my mind which of the figs I would choose.

Plath takes us convincingly on a journey into the mind of Greenwood as she slips further and further from reality and into the medical world of shock treatments in the 1960's. I remember as a child hearing my relatives talk of a great aunt who was receiving shock treatments, what an inhumane act! Sad, depressing, poetic and funny at times I found the book enjoyable although it's a serious subject. As stated previously this work is semi autobiographical.

She had spent the entire winter in isolation, in the grip of a long depressive cycle. I imagine a young mother, in her 30s, starting the day as usual: she would prepare bread and milk for her children and place it near their beds; then she’d open their windows and seal off the room with masking tape so the gas wouldn’t reach them because she’d decided to kill herself, but wouldn’t have allowed her children to die with her. The script of this imaginary play has already been written. As many will point out later, her actions were rational and decisive, so there is no way her suicide wasn’t intentional.But was it? Plath’s suicide note reads “Call Dr. Horder” with a phone number written at the bottom of it. She taped it to the children’s stroller and whatever the reason for what’ll follow, she wanted the note to be found. It could have been a cry for help more than a deliberate act of suicide, of course, as she was had already attempted suicide earlier in her life, by driving her car to a lake. Nowadays the case study of Sylvia Plath could be described in other words, synonymous with the term “suicidal artist”. She had written her first poem at the age of eight and was born a prodigy. Unfortunately, the genius poet’s journey to success was interrupted after numerous nervous breakdowns. A few days before she died, she wrote a poem: 
Edge“The Woman is perfected.Her DeadBody where is the smile of accomplishment,The inclusion of a Greek necessityFlows in the scrolls of her toga.Her bareFeet seem to be sayingWe have come so far, it is over.Each dead child coiled, a white serpent,One at each littlePitcher of milk, now emptyShe has foldedThem back into her body as petalsOf a rose close when the gardenStiffens and odours bleedFrom the sweet, deep throats of the night flowers.”
As I was writing this review, I stumbled across many negative opinions about Plath’s suicide, described as an act of selfishness, because she was a mother and her death also caused her son, Nick Hughes, to suffer from some critical issues and on top of that, from depression. There is also a controversy surrounding her husband but honestly, how can you point a finger towards such a delicate situation - that surely needed to be analyzed and treated with care - that potentially happened in a very difficult environment for both Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath to live in? People are so superficial and that makes me mad. What I want to enlighten instead is a more intimate cry for help that for me comes directly out of Plath’s most famous work, The Bell Jar.
“The trouble was, I had been inadequate all along, I simply hadn’t thought about it.”
Plath had gone through some unpleasant adventures before publishing her masterpiece. She started a career at Mademoiselle magazine in Manhattan and due to the intense pressure she felt while working there, she started to be disillusioned about her career as a writer. She could hope for more, sure, but predatory men, food poisoning and heat waves made it difficult for her to keep the expectations high. She saw a psychiatrist and experienced electroshock therapy at Valley Head Hospital, outside Boston, which left her deep trauma. Her depression worsened, but then she recovered at McLean Hospital, and her mental health improved in early 1954. If you read The Bell Jar and what I described sounds familiar to you, it’s because Plath fictionalised all of her experiences in it. Plath speaks through the character of Esther, and her breakdowns and emotions feel real because Plath experienced them, but unlike me - who could see themselves unfortunately represented during the whole story - and many other people who struggle with depression, Plath is an artist at words and her descriptions come out exceptionally well. The result is a truthful, organic tale. However, The Bell Jar is a critique of the psychiatric system at the time of the author’s life and an attack on patriarchy that saw women’s ambition as neurotic. Both A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man by James Joyce and The Bell Jar treat their characters with a gentle satire, and aim to contain the modernist images of paralysis, decay and ultimately death and urban desolation. I love how the very first line of The Bell Jar hinted at Esther’s fate later in the book, and immediately set the tone: “It was a queer, sultry summer, the summer they electrocuted the Rosenbergs, and I didn’t know what I was doing in New York.” Plath breaks down Esther’s depression without the intention of glamorising it. Instead, she shows her protagonist the empathy the doctors lacked with Esther. The discouraging fate of a woman in a paternalistic psychiatric system is sided with another issue, the male gaze: “At last, obediently, like the mouth of a ventriloquist’s dummy, my own mouth started to quirk up.”The Bell Jar is also full of interesting symbolism. Of course, the most iconic is the fig tree that torments the protagonist. “From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple pig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor…” Esther’s dilemma consists in a multitude of opportunities she could take in life, but society forces women to choose only one path because it’s impossible for them to be both a mother figure and career driven. “I saw myself sitting in the crotch of the fig-tree, starving to death, just because I couldn’t make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.” On another hand, the fig tree can be viewed as contradictory. Each branch represents a different choice. That means the fig tree could be perceived as a positive image, as it doesn’t really restrict the path a woman could choose to one. That said Esther finds the multitude of choices overwhelming. The question manifests as Esther’s inner turmoil: to be a woman or to be an individual? And does being a woman mean that you have to be a mother? The incapacity of choosing a path leads to starvation which, I guess, is another indicator for Esther’s unhealthy mentality.But, decontextualising the fig tree from its original context, it is still impressive for us because whether we are a woman or a man, there will be a time when we’ll have to choose what to do in life. It can happen shortly after graduating or we’ll find purpose later, growing older. In such a globalized world we live in, it can be overwhelming to just choose one path, hence why I hate the reductiveness of human life. In the end I found that for me the only way to dive into endless possibilities is by telling stories and making them as concrete as possible. I hope to become a director someday and the journey will indeed be just as difficult as choosing one fig out of the many branches on the fig tree. 
“I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead; I lift my eyes and all is born again.”
Sylvia Plath was ahead of her time when she spoke of mental illness. However, I wouldn’t say the same about racism and homophobia. But then again, not to justify anything, but I think (as a queer individual and non binary person) that you cannot judge an author without knowing of the context, both historical and societal, in which they lived in. Though I get that The Bell Jar has the danger of reaching just a certain, targeted, audience, instead of speaking to everyone. Mental illness is something we can all empathize with, because it’s something we can all potentially experience. Through the racist and homophobic commentary, Plath seeks to refer to white and heterosexual individuals who suffer from mental illness, or so it seemed to me. Whatever. I loved this book and hated it at the same time. It’s both a personal attack and a warm hug, a reminder that we are not alone in experiencing awful feelings. One thing that I noticed by going to therapy is that I have never been more dissociated with reality in my entire life; by living constantly in my thoughts, it’s easy to lose track of time and to forget what really matters. That we’re here, present. And nobody can change that. 4.5/5"

Показва го по такъв начин, че да се зарадваме на своето собствено положение, така че да сме благодарни за своя собствен живот, уверявайки ни, че може и по-зле.

For all that we know medically, the brain is the organ we know least about. Why does it function in most people and yet in some, it decides to go in a path that is totally alien to the human spirit? I think Ms Plath was trying in this book so show that anyone can be a bit insane and how we deal with the insane moments in our lives makes the difference between normalcy and lunacy. Why is it that the heroine of this story, so filled with giftedness and the ability to be anything she wishes, finds that her one wish is to end the life she has been given? How very sad to see a woman of promise go down the road to insanity and like the rest of us feel that we sometimes are in a jar where we become specimens for someone else?

Man hat das Gefühl Esther ist außer Stande auch nur irgendeinem Menschen - auch nicht sich selbst - Zuneigung oder Liebe entgegenzubringen. Sie ist gefühlskalt gegenüber Menschen die ihr gegenüber Zuneigung empfinden, sie verletzt diese Menschen sogar.Man muss Esther aber auch nicht gern haben um sich, zumindest in Teilen, mit ihr identifizieren zu können, bzw. ihre Handlungen nachvollziehen zu können. Der Roman spielt in den 50ern, eine Zeit in der Frau sich zwischen Familie und Karriere entscheiden musste. Das ist heute auch oft genug noch der Fall, aber während dieses Bild heute (zumindest oberflächlich) unterstützt wird, war dieser Lebensentwurf damals noch nicht einmal in den Vorstellungen der Menschen vorhanden. Esther Greenwood möchte aber beides, einen tollen Job plus Mann und Kinder. Ihr stehen beide Optionen offen, da sie eine hervorragende Studentin ist und einen Verehrer hat. Sie vergleicht ihre Situation mit einem Feigenbaum, wobei jede Frucht eine andere Möglichkeit darstellt und während sie noch da steht und überlegt welche sie wählen soll, verschrumpeln die Feigen und fallen zu Boden. Bevor Esther sich falsch entscheidet, entscheidet sie sich lieber gar nicht. Sie wird apathisch und langsam aber stetig senkt sich eine Glasglocke über sie und schneidet sie von allen anderen Menschen ab. Sie empfindet diese Glasglocke als einen Fremdkörper den sie nicht kontrollieren kann. Selbst am Ende nachdem sich die Glasglocke wieder gehoben hat, spürt sie diese immer noch bedrohlich über sich hängen und weiß, dass die Glasglocke nie verschwinden wird und sich jederzeit wieder über sie herabsenken kann. Wie jeder relativ schnell erkennt, ist die Glasglocke nichts anderes als Depressionen. Wenn man ein bisschen über Sylvia Plath recherchiert, wird schnell klar, dass Die Glasglocke stark autobiographisch eingefärbt ist. Bei Wikipedia heißt es der Roman sei semiautobiographisch. Aus diesem Grund finde ich es fast unmöglich das Buch unabhängig von der Autorin zu betrachten. Das ist auch ein Grund weshalb ich das Geschriebene als realitätsgetreu annehme, auch wenn Esther's Perspektive mehr als nur einmal sehr fragwürdig erscheint. Ihre Sicht auf manche Personen will sich mir nicht ganz erschließen und ich frage mich inwieweit die Depression ihre Wahrnehmung verzerrt und ob Plath genau dies bezwecken wollte.Was der Roman meiner Meinung nach ebenfalls sehr gelungen darstellt, ist die extreme Oberflächlichkeit der Gesellschaft. So tut Esther's Mutter die Depressionen ihrer Tochter als bloße Verstimmungen ab, die sich durch Arbeit kurieren lassen und gibt ihr durch die Blume selbst die Schuld daran. Am Schluss sagt die Mutter, dass sie diesen Lebensabschnitt Esther's einfach vergessen und als bösen Traum ansehen sollen. Nur dass für Esther unter der Glasglocke alles außerhalb ein böser Traum ist.Die ""Freundschaften"" wirkten auf mich sehr aufgesetzt. Mal versteht man sich total gut mit der einen Freundin, dann findet man sie kurz darauf super ätzend und sehnt sich nach der anderen Freundin über die man vorher noch gelästert hat.Sehr bezeichnend für diese Oberflächlichkeit fand ich zwei Szenen. Eine in der Esther während eines Fototermins in Tränen ausbricht, worauf alle Personen den Raum verlassen sie ""ausheulen"" lassen und anschließend so tun als sei nichts gewesen. In der anderen Szene, werden alle Gewinnerinnen des Schreibwettbewerbs von einer angesagten Modezeitschrift zu einem schicken Dinner eingeladen und fangen sich eine Lebensmittelvergiftung durch verdorbenes Krabbenfleisch ein. Unter dem glitzernden Schein der Modewelt sitzt das faulende Krabbenfleisch und selbst Bilder von leckeren Gerichten werden geschönt.Ich mochte Sylvia Plath's Schreibstil, sie verwendet viele Metaphern die ich sehr gut nachvollziehen und verstehen konnte. Das ist nicht selbstverständlich, ich bin schnell überfordert von zu vielen Metaphern oder Symbolik, aber in diesem Fall fand ich jede einzelne sehr passend und gut umgesetzt. Das Buch ist so voller Bilder und Gedanken, dass ich hier nur einen Bruchteil angesprochen habe. Ich werde noch eine Weile über diesen dünnen Roman nachdenken müssen."

Udaje jej się otrzymać miesięczny staż w Nowym Jorku w redakcji magazynu dla dziewcząt. Rozpoczyna nowe życie, tak bardzo różniące się od tego, które wiodła dotychczas – w biedzie, „na zabitej deskami prowincji”. Wielkie miasto stoi przed nią otworem. Ma okazję zaznać wolności, luksusu i chociaż przez jakiś czas prowadzić życie, wydawałoby się, jak ze snu. Jednak  dziewczyna mimo wszystko najchętniej leżałaby w swoim hotelowym łóżku. Nie ma na nic ochoty. Nie potrafi się odnaleźć w tej sytuacji. Nagle plan, który miała przez całe życie, okazuje się, że nie ma już znaczenia. Dobre oceny, które zdobywała przez cały czas, przestają się liczyć. W momencie kiedy jest na początku wybranej przez siebie życiowej drogi, nagle przestaje wiedzieć na czym jej tak naprawdę zależy i kim naprawdę jest. Nie może spać, jeść, czytać. Zamiast możliwości rozpoczęcia wymarzonej kariery, do Esther przychodzi załamanie.  Niecały miesiąc po wydaniu książki Sylvia Plath popełniła samobójstwo.  Książka Plath mnie zachwyciła. Nie wciągnęła. Ona wręcz pochłonęła mnie tak, że ciężko było mi ją odłożyć. Ogromny wpływ na to miało na pewno to, że nie miałam problemu z tym, żeby utożsamić się z główną bohaterką. Czytając o losach Esther, często miałam wrażenie, że czytam o sobie.  Bardzo poruszył mnie moment, w którym podczas rozmowy bohaterki z Jotką padła prośba „(…) ale niech mi pani powie, jakie są pani plany na przyszłość”. I nagle odpowiedź, która przez cały czas była dla dziewczyny oczywistością – stypendium, uczelnia, pisanie - z przerażeniem, nieświadomie, odpowiedziała „Sama nie wiem”. I dopiero po wypowiedzeniu tego na głos, uświadomiła sobie, że to prawda. W tym momencie musiałam się zatrzymać, żeby zastanowić się nad tym fragmentem i z równym przerażeniem co Esther, stwierdziłam, że rozumiem ją wręcz doskonale. Od dzieciaka zaplanowane życie, nagle stało się jedną wielką niewiadomą, a droga do przyszłości została drastycznie przerwana chorobą. Wszystko nagle straciło sens.  Esther wprawdzie zaczyna chodzić do psychiatry i rozpoczyna leczenie farmakologiczne. Nie daje ono jednak żadnych rezultatów. Do życia dziewczyny wkradają się coraz cięższe myśli samobójcze. Żyletka staje się jej nieodłącznym elementem. Niedziałające leczenie jest coraz bardziej frustrujące. Zaczynają się próby samobójcze. Jej choroba przybiera na tyle ciężki wymiar, że potrzebna jest hospitalizacja. Potem dzięki pewnej kobiecie Esther trafia do renomowanej, prywatnej kliniki, gdzie pod opieką doktora Gordona rozpoczyna najcięższą walkę jaką może toczyć człowiek – walkę o swoje życie. Walkę z najtrudniejszym przeciwnikiem – własnym umysłem, samym sobą.Odniosłam wrażenie, że dziewczyna toczy walkę sama ze sobą. Mimo chęci zabicia się, boi się śmierci. Jednak równie mocno boi się życia. Próbuje ze sobą skończyć, ale ostatecznie strach (a może głęboko ukryta iskierka nadziei na poprawę?) wygrywa.  Akcja dzieje się w latach pięćdziesiątych XX wieku. Wtedy rzeczy takie jak choroby psychiczne, psychiatria były jeszcze większym tematem tabu niż dzisiaj. Osobiście uważam, że w dzisiejszych czasach i tak o chorobach psychicznych mówi się zdecydowanie za mało i nadal pozostają one po części tym tematem tabu, jednak na pewno nie tak bardzo jak w czasach, w których dzieje się akcja powieści.  Automatycznie też po głowie zaczynają krążyć myśli, czy gdyby wiedza o chorobach psychicznych i psychiatrii była większa i nie byłby to temat tak przemilczany, Sylvia Plath przeżyłaby więcej niż zaledwie 30 lat? Czy mielibyśmy okazję przeczytać więcej wspaniałych dzieł, które mogłyby wypłynąć spod pióra autorki? Na te pytania niestety nigdy nie poznamy odpowiedzi.  Pozostaje jedynie mieć nadzieję, że o chorobach psychicznych zacznie się mówić tak, jak o chorobach fizycznych. I że życie nie będzie przerastało tylu wspaniałych osób - takich jak Sylvia Plath.  Lena Dunham pisze o książce „(…) Sylvia Plath była taka jak my. Tyle że nie miała na półce Szklanego klosza.” Uważam, że jest to idealne podsumowanie mojej opinii o „Szklanym kloszu”. "

""I took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart. I am, I am, I am.”
This book is a semi-autobiographical work, the only published novel we have from Sylvia Plath, firstly published under a pseudonym in 1963, and after her death, under her own name.major trigger warnings: suicide attempts, sexual assault, self-harm.There are several lenses to go about a review of this book, but all I think must emphasize how remarkable it is, and also say upfront what this book is about: suicide. There is no beating around this. Yes it talks about womanhood, yes it critiques the 50s, but this book is about suicide and major depression, and it feels strange the blurbs of the book don’t reflect that. I'm new to Sylvia’s writings but from what I’ve read, I think it was important for Plath to take hold of her own story and tell it, maybe control it through manipulating it as she wished, while looking back with more insight into what was happening to her, through the Bell Jar. I think, yes the book draws many many experiences from her real life, but to say the voice of this book is her own is a disservice to her writing power. It’s interesting that she took her own experiences and decided to tell them through this very obviously flawed character. Esther’s presence was so brilliantly achieved, that it becomes almost the main reason as to why some will dislike the book. It’s the best aspect of it but it can also draw away a lot of readers. More than anything, this book is important simply from being a full open window, a first hand telling of suicide ideation. The waves of depression are now more and more talked of and normalized but often times people don’t, or can’t really, understand what is the state of mind that leads to taking your own life. The suffering in this book is so intense and vivid, and told through such a lense of detachment and numbness, that you start understanding why it seems like there is no escape. The estrangement from oneself, the slow paralysis of feeling trapped and seeing life perish away and loved ones hurt — all contributing to this spiral that keeps descending and descending. The fact the book ended on a rather hopeful note is even more heart breaking considering the author committed suicide shortly after the publishing of the book. It was too soon, and just a few years later, her books would be greatly appreciated, and maybe medicine a bit more advanced and aware of treatments for her disease. The second lens is of course the subject of sex and feminism. The way the author recalled her experiences as an adolescent, the view of sex and men was extremely important then and continues to be now. We are not alone, and sexual assault continues to be frequent, unfortunately. These experiences need to be consistently written and talked about, even if they are so painful it physically hurt to read sometimes. I could say so much more about this story, this is not nearly enough, and I am just fresh out of reading it, I want to keep reading more about it! about Sylvia, and re-read this book, absolutely."
324,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1076079-karen,Rating 4 out of 5,"3.5 stars. ""Bell jar"" was a foreign term to me except as a book title. But what else it is, I had no inkling. I picture it as a glass dome, which might fit over a cake plate or a cheese platter. For Ms Plath it was a perfect depiction of what descends over a mentally ill person when s/he is beginning an episode of feeling trapped, isolated, and suicidal.With the book being based on Sylvia Plath's dark and brooding life, I wondered if writing about it -- reliving it in a sense -- was at all cathartic for her, or did it simply exacerbate her feelings of being stuck beneath the bell jar? I'd like to think it granted her some relief and gave her more time on earth to enjoy her life and children. But I doubt it. She seemed to be headed in the direction of suicide and that's where she landed (with her head in a kitchen oven). Sad to know -- and I only know because she wrote it in the book -- that she never wanted to get married, have children, or live as was expected of a woman of the 1950s, yet turned out that was exactly what she did. She also earned notoriety and respect as a writer, but was she ever happy? This book felt haunted by Ms Plath's ghost, circling above Esther, dictating her every thought, ready to drop the bell jar on her at any time. Esther's thinking and obsessing were quite different to the way my thoughts operate, so it took me some time to get used to it. Not being able to reread on an audiobook, Esther's descent into her breakdown seemed to come on rather suddenly and spun out of control quickly, or else I just didn't understand it. The use of electro- shock therapy was quite popular then and I don't understand that either. The story itself ended on a positive note with hope for the future, quickly debunked in the Afterword, however, with how her life ended.The writing: At first, while I was still trying to warm up to it, the prose seemed rambling and laden with words pulled straight out of a thesaurus, as if written for a professor grading a thesis. The writing improved page by page, chapter by chapter, and I admit to finally getting caught up in it.I didn't care much for (actress) Maggie Gyllenhaal's narration in the beginning, thinking she sounded young, immature, unemotional, and depressed. Then, duh, quickly realized that's exactly how she should sound portraying someone who is 19 and bi-polar. 'Twas an honorable portrayal. I just can't use the word ""love"" on this one, but it has haunted my thoughts for several days since finishing it."
325,no user info,Rating 1 out of 5,"Wow... I really did not like this book. I looked at some of the other reviews and again I just don't get what people loved so much about this book. I had very high expectations as "" The Bell Jar"" is known to all as a classic in the world of feminism literature and psychology. I am highly critical because of my background in psychology, but this books falls so much off the mark I can't understand the high praise. During a high school psychology class we were given a choice of novels to read and present on and "" The Bell Jar"" and ""Sybil"" were two of the books on the list. I struggled to figure out which book to read but finally settled on ""Sybil"". ""Sybil"" remains to this day my favorite book regarding psychological illness and treatment. So, I believe I made a really good decision because after finally reading "" The Bell Jar"" (many years removed from my high school psychology class and my work as a psychotherapist) I am highly disappointed. This novel is not well paced and more than 60% of the book is about the Esther Greenwood's life in NYC and college life. Only the very latter of the book deals with her subsequent ""nervous breakdown"" and time spent in the asylum. Unlike "" Sybil"" there was no in depth commentary on the treatment that Greenwood received besides the fact that she had shock treatments. There was no mention of diagnosis, of therapuetic modules used in psychotherapy or medication (besides insulin which as far as I know has never been sued for psychological treatment I could be wrong on this -- I never spent much time on the hx of psychopharmcology ) Although shock treatments were very popular during the time Mrs. Plath's wrote this novel, which most say is closely based on her own life experiences suffering from depression and anxiety (leading to her own suicide just a few years after this book's publication), she definitely would have been able to add more to this narrative of a young women's struggles with mental illness and her treatment in the 1950's.Skip this book -- Read Sybil!"

327,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/126355938-river,Rating 4 out of 5,"**edit: coming back to say this book contains so much racism & it’s disgusting. someone before said sylvia plath ruined the bell jar & they’re completely right. this used to be my favorite book, but her use of slurs and blatantly racist comments are inexcusable. i’ll still keep my original review up, but it’s important to talk about & acknowledge why these books are problematic!! if you’re gonna read it, please use critical thinking.**tw: suicide, depression, sexual assault“i took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart. i am, i am, i am.” this was just me doing another reread & it literally gets me every. single. time. my head & heart both hurt after reading this. i absolutely love sylvia’s writing & her way of describing her emotions and the world around her. this book is just so intense & i am incapable of forming any coherent thoughts rn. i think about the bell jar 25/8 & i will never shut up about this book!!!!!!!!!"
328,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31298089-daniel-carpio,Rating 2 out of 5,"Well, I did not like this as much as I thought I would. It sucks because I know this is a classic and loved by many… and don’t get me wrong, this is written b e a u t i f u l l l y, BUT, It just did not resonate with me whatsoever. I was bored out of my mind while reading this and just kept pushing through because I was a little intrigued as to how it would end. The second half of this book was better than the first (hence my 2-star rating as opposed to 1-star) and it helped me actually finish the book. Was it super depressing? Oh yes. But, because I didn’t really connect with Esther, it didn’t really affect me as much as it probably should have. "
329,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6506088-elyse,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book has been on my ""To Advance My Literary Education"" list for a long time. I learned that Sylvia Plath is not praised by the literati for this novel but because of her poetry. I unexpectedly found parts of this book funny. But this semi-autobiographical book is about a young American woman in the 1950s who descended into madness; so the story is tragic.Sorry for all the posts - I should have proof-read this better"
