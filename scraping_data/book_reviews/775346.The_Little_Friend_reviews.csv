0,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/789575-tee,Rating 3 out of 5,"Currently reading this one and all I can think of is a passage from a writing-fiction manual that I read. The guy who wrote the article said that he once wrote a whole book and his publisher told him that it was good back-story, it was good for the AUTHOR to get to know his characters so when he wrote about them - they'd be 3D and real but it wasn't necessary for the readers to know most of the stuff that was written. You can remove a lot of the bulk from that first draft and keep it to yourself in your notes. Things such as the character's births, clothing preferences, favourite foods and colours, hates, loves and so on.Tartt's work reminds me of that ... so many of the pages that are unnecessary, there's so much that could have been cut out but the thing is, I enjoy it. I really do. I wouldn't like it if every book that I read was as verbose and wandering as Tartt's, but I do so enjoy reading something like this on occasion. It reminds me of how much I enjoy language and the craft of beautiful sentence-structure, description ... how much I've always enjoyed story-telling about people and their surroundings. --------------I finished this book last night and when I read the final sentence, my mouth dropped open slightly, the book dropped from my hand onto the floor and I rolled over, squeezing my eyes shut in hopes that I would go immediately to sleep and not come on Goodreads and spew forth wtf's.This woman knows how to write. She's great at it. But she goes frickin' NOWHERE with ANY of it. It's unbelievable! So unbelievable that I spent the entire book literally saying out loud, Oh.My.God, in reference to her superb ability to spew forth wonderfully crafted sentences and paragraphs about nothing. NOTHING! Anyone that can write an entire book about nothing is some type of wonderbeast. Don't get me wrong, I'm not attacking her for this - I'm really just astounded at her mad skills at weaving elaborate, wandering tales.I even thought, dude, this has to building up to some climatic ending and holy shit, if you ever get that far you will probably have the same astounded expression on your face as I did. There were so many times in this book while I was reading that I said to myself in my head: This.Lady.Is.Unfuckingbelievable. Four, five, TEN pages could pass without anything happening. YOU COULD SCRAP THESE PAGES and not know any better. Get someone to do that, get someone to rip every other ten pages out and you will never know what you have missed, plot-wise at least.There were sooo many moments where I'd be like, dude, how is this even relevant or necessary? WHY CAN'T I STOP READING?! The entire book; waffle. Amazingly crafted prose that goes nowhere. I felt like I was having to force myself through some of it, even though I was interested. I just wanted things to regularly happen and when they didn't, I got restless. I'd measure how much I had left to go and groan. Sometimes I'd pick my book up and realise that I was holding it upside down yet I'd been staring at the page for a minute or two. Sometimes I realised I'd written a to-do list in my head, planned dinner, said the alphabet backwards and counted to 100 in French whilst having turned four or five pages. I slept, ate and drank whilst holding this book open and staring at the page through my eyelids. But at the same time, I felt this inner battle, this conflict because I was bored BUT I WAS JUST SO GOD DAMN INTERESTED. It is a massive pile of words. Tasty, heavy, Southern-saturated wordy goodness.This entire review; waffle. Poorly constructed sentences that are trying to make a point. Something to do with too much sleep, not enough caffeine on rising. I won't be forgiven, but Tartt will.-------------------Besides from ranting about Tartt's waffle - which another reviewer describes as this book being a 'reading experience'; a nifty way of describing it, this book really is good. You really do experience this novel. it's really nothing like any other book that I have read. The characters are the most dimensional, REAL people that I have encountered in a long time. I felt like I was there, I felt the heat, I heard the snakes, I almost felt like I could touch every part of Harriet's house. I loved the relationships between the people and the descriptions of everything. Basically, I loved everything about this book except for the fact that nothing happened, and there's basically no resolution to any of the issues raised in the book but because of how well crafted it all is, I forgive her.

2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/115525-leslie,Rating 2 out of 5,"This book, quite honestly, infuriated me. The opening chapter is stellar and haunting -- so much so that I slogged through 500+ pages on its promise alone. Anyone beginning this novel will (rightly so) expect a Southern Gothic murder mystery. The premise (at least the one outlined on the dust jacket) has so much potential -- set in a sleepy backwater Mississippi town, it follows the ""adventures"" of an overly precocious girl from a fallen plantation family (think Scout Finch meets Nancy Drew) who has vowed to find and punish her brother's killer. However, the novel's momentum is quickly stalled by chapters and chapters of *Abject Naturalism* -- scene after scene of lush, dramatic, heady descriptions, microscopically attentive odes to Southern hallmarks like kudzu, honeysuckle, bickering maiden aunts, decrepit railroad tracks, sassy black maids, biscuits with maple syrup, poor white boys who look like they could have stepped out of a Confederate tintype, etc. At first, I patiently waded through these indulgent and often silly window-dressings, encouraged ever so slightly by Tartt's prose style. However, Tartt takes unforgivable advantage of her linguistic flair, so much so that the suspense totally evaporates, and the true engine of the novel (the mystery and romance of the murdered brother) essentially gets lost among innumerable, inconsequential, floridly written digressions, all of which do nothing to advance the narrative. I carried 500 pages of information around in my head, determined to sniff out clues and sleuth alongside our protagonist - only to find, in the end, that it was a futile venture."
3,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/220136-tina,Rating 4 out of 5,"I sort of want to scream when I read lukewarm reviews of this book. Admittedly, people may get the wrong idea when they read the back jacket, or the first few pages, and anticipate some sort of murder mystery thrill.The death of Harriet's brother is merely background for her character. The skill with which Tartt explores the inner workings and thought processes of a virtually abandoned 12 year old girl whose older brother's murder has never been solved cannot be praised highly enough. Tartt seems to have magically leaped over that crevasse that seperates us from our youth, and from understanding the mysterious social workings of 12 year olds.I found this book, though lengthy, to be absolutely riveting."
4,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32879029-emma,Rating 3 out of 5,"A lot of things happened in this book, but at the same time...And in a much more real way...Nothing did.I tend to like Donna Tartt's writing enough that she could cook up a book with no plot, just vibes, and I'd be pleased, but I also tend to find Tartt's writing atmospheric and consuming, borderline eerie. I don't typically like her characters, but I'm usually unendingly interested in them. And while her books aren't dictated by storylines, there's always some uniting thread, a fascinating subplot or question or object that brings the plot (such as it is) and the reader with it.This, for me, did not have any of that.While our protagonist, a ""precocious"" kid whose brother's death haunts her family and life, was enough to help me in my dumb and unnecessary (and, I'll have you know, successful) attempt to finish this six hundred and fifty page book in a day, everyone else was a snooze.The villains weren't villains, which was the point, but nor were they all that fun to read about.I don't read Donna Tartt to learn lessons, necessarily, and what felt like an emphasis on silly and mundane themes on this was enough to take me and this novel to the damn breaking point.I don't have anything nice to say about this, and yet I can't make myself lower the rating.Bottom line: Humans are inexplicable. If that observation seems wise to you, you'll like this book.--------------currently-reading updatesdonna tartt could write a 900-pager about southwestern agricultural trends in the first half of the nineteenth century and i'd be like...sign me upclear ur sh*t book 34quest 16: read an intimidating book"
5,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/73200741-pedro,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is not The Secret History and definitely not The Goldfinch but that doesn’t justify the low rating and negative reviews on here. Well, actually, just by thinking that a novel like The Goldfinch doesn’t even have a 4 star rating on average says a lot, not about the novel itself but about its readers, and this takes me to one of the biggest problems about sites like Goodreads: the hype and the fact that it seems like a lot of people have no idea which books and authors might or might not work for them. As I grow more and more familiar to this site and the reading habits of its users, I have started to perceive some really annoying and even frustrating “things” that happen too much for my liking. Books are being picked up (by mistake, obviously) by the wrong readers! Another thing happening a lot on here (especially when a book or author is surrounded by too much hype) is that a certain kind of readers end up giving it a bad rating; not because they didn’t like it but simply because they don’t want to admit they ended up loving it as much as or even more than other people! Last, but not least important is the fact that when there’s too much hype surrounding a book a lot of readers avoid it like a pandemic (sorry!) and so the ‘right book’ remains unread by the ‘right readers’ only because it had been read by the wrong ones! Figure that out!So, there’s the thing about this book, if you really liked Tartt’s writing and storytelling skills in the past and still haven’t read this one; the chances are you’re also going to like this one. I believe it to be Tartt’s most personal book to date and as always she gives a lot of detail (light, weather, furniture, colours, feelings...) which might be a problem for some readers but not for me! I loved it all even more this time; the descriptions, the characters, the writing, the slowness of the plot (when compared to her other two books). Most of all I loved something which most readers find the most frustrating thing of all when reading a novel: the lack of answers. If you still haven’t read Tartt, but like good literary fiction, I honestly don’t know what you are waiting for? She started her career at the top of her game and I don’t believe she will ever “drop the ball”. At this point of my review I think it’s clear how much I love and admire Donna Tartt’s work. Her novels are the novels I wish I could have written and this one is no exception. Haunting and unforgettable.Compelling and mysterious. Beautiful and mesmerising."
6,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/111921-madeline,Rating 1 out of 5,"""Bestselling author Donna Tartt returns with a grandly ambitious and utterly riveting novel of childhood, innocence and evil.The setting is Alexandria, Mississippi, where one Mother’s Day a little boy named Robin Cleve Dufresnes was found hanging from a tree in his parents’ yard. Twelve years later Robin’s murder is still unsolved and his family remains devastated. So it is that Robin’s sister Harriet - unnervingly bright, insufferably determined, and unduly influenced by the fiction of Kipling and Robert Louis Stevenson--sets out to unmask his killer. Aided only by her worshipful friend Hely, Harriet crosses her town’s rigid lines of race and caste and burrows deep into her family’s history of loss.""Having read Tartt's previous book, The Secret History, and loved it so much I did everything except start a cult based on the characters, I expected to feel the same way about this. But I didn't. Know why this book gets only one star? YOU NEVER FIND OUT WHO KILLS ROBIN. Let me just reiterate that: the mystery of who/what could have possibly been able to appear in someone's backyard, while the entire family is within hearing range and two kids are sitting on the back porch, and grab a nine year old boy and hang him in a tree, leaving no trace, motive, or evidence, IS NEVER SOLVED. Excuse me while I bash my head against the wall for a minute. ...Okay, I'm back. Disregarding that highly irritating nitpick that is guaranteed to keep me awake at night, The Little Friend is actually a very good story. Fascinating, terrifying, complex (at times a little too complex, I must admit - the extensive cast of characters was hard to keep track of at times), morbidly engrossing, and with an ending that refuses to tell you anything.Ahem. I'm fine, really. But seriously Donna: come on. I want to know who killed Robin. Know how badly? I'm tempted to start stalking you and showing up at your door in the middle of the night, demanding answers because I KNOW YOU HAVE THEM. Here's the thing: since Donna Tartt is basically a genius (see The Secret History, a more wrapped-up and concentrated story, and my favorite of the two Tartt novels), I've convinced myself that she has, in fact, figured out who the killer is. Not only that, I think she reveals who the killer is through a hundred little clues and details hidden throughout the book, and we as the readers are supposed to prove our worth by locating these clues, putting them all together, and solving the mystery. I'm sorry, Donna. I failed your test. How about this: if I come to your house and kowtow repeatedly while shrieking ""I'm not worthy! I'm not worthy!"" will you please, please throw a thickheaded reader a bone and tell me who killed Robin? How about if I bring you chocolate?"
7,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1166369-annet,Rating 4 out of 5,"Part one: while reading it... This is what you call a 'slow read'. It is impossible to race thru these pages. That is why I had two prior unsuccessful attempts to read this book. An impatient mood is not a good mindset to read this one. But I loved The Secret History and I just know that Donna Tartt is a good writer. You just have to have quiet time on your hands to read this one. So I'm taking my time with this one and it's rewarding. The descriptions Donna Tartt uses are long and sometimes it takes pages and nothing really happens. But, as another reviewer said, boy, does Donna Tartt know how to write, eventhough nothing much really happens. How she describes persons, surroundings, history, landscape. It's something you have to take in slowly, taking in all the words in slowly. So I read this book when the weather is good, outside in the garden, like this weekend. It doesn't really work to read this book before going to sleep, I just don't take in the words as I should. I have come to accept that the storyline is slow. I love sitting down and reading pages & pages about the brothers Ratliff, about the aunts of Harriet, about the brokendown parts of the town.... it's beautiful writing. I'm around page 257 today, halfway thru, so I expect it will take some more time to finish this one.Part two: after having read it: December: I finished The Little Friend! Summer has gone and winter is here... and I did take time. Part of the reason being that I got this one as a very heavy hardcover, so while travelling, I just don't take it with me. And while travelling, I read the most. And at some point, I just concluded I needed this book besides my bed, to read a couple of pages every day, slow and taking in all the detail. I can imagine that some people feel betrayed becauwe of the beginning intriguing plot and then how this book progresses, but I have to say... I really don't care. I loved this book, the style, the characters, the story, the southern atmosphere. All of it. Sure I would have secretely liked to see a clear ending and a solution to the mystery, but at some point I saw it coming that this one was gonna be different. When I finally got through the first say one fourth one third of the book I started immensely enjoying this book. Donna Tartt is a great, talented writer. How great is it to get into the mind of a child growing up fast and describe it in such amazing detail! Four stars. I gave Secret History five, because I think that story on the whole was just a bit better than this one. Already looking forward to the next book of Donna Tartt. And I really have to reread the Secret History. Take your time with this one and enjoy it!"
8,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10171516-jessica,Rating 4 out of 5,"i love DTs writing with every fibre of my being, but i have to be honest - the low average rating/poor reviews for this book had pushed me away from reading it for the longest time - i didnt want to ruin my high opinion of DT. fortunately, i didnt hate this like i thought i would!this is not without its faults, however, and i would consider this to be a minor sophomore slump of a novel. i agree that the length is much too long for this particular story, with slow pacing and unnecessary details leading to reader fatigue. but there are some particularly bright spots in what is otherwise a very dark novel. there is evocative imagery, consistent themes, and endearing characterisation (hely and harriet are amazing together). i do also appreciate the apparent love DT has for the south and how her own childhood experiences are translated into her writing. although i would consider this to be DTs weakest novel, it in no way has lessened my opinion of her capabilities as an author. i just wish she didnt take 10 years to write a book because i want more of her stories!↠ 3.5 stars"
9,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36555254-robin,Rating 5 out of 5,"A Southern tale set in small town Mississippi shows the wreckage left behind after a beloved son, grandson, and brother, Robin, is murdered in his own front yard. Evoking a little of Scout Finch, and a little of Flavia de Luce (child sleuth from Alan Bradley's books), Harriet Cleve Dufresnes decides to solve her big brother's unresolved death. Despite her innocence and youth, Harriet is deadly serious and doesn't mess around. This isn't a 'cute' story despite its childish heroine.There's so much I adore about this book. The setting: circa 1970's when kids didn't know what screens were for the most part, Southern U.S. with dilapidated old plantation houses with names such as ""Tribulation"". The people: a collection of doting, aging great-aunties, a pre-teen boy who will do anything to impress his girl pal, and a gruff housekeeper who smells like love.Like her other two books, this one is lengthy, but is blessed with the same incredible storytelling I've come to expect from Tartt. She delves into the mindset of a twelve year old girl so well, illuminating lingering racial and class prejudices, and the brokenness of her family. Harriet's life reaches a turning point; she is forced to grow up during this pivotal summer.Despite the length, I flew through it. I couldn't help myself!! I was all in. The characters are fascinating and rich. The mystery is spellbinding. And, of course, the snakes. They were far scarier than the white trash meth heads. I was gasping aloud during many scenes. Eeeeeeeeeeeeek. Hisssssssssss. How do people in Mississippi walk around? I think I'd need to be sedated in order to go out of doors. A few things were more than a little odd - the cover with the creepy old doll head - WHY? I noted the reference to one of the auntie's dolls, but it was such a minuscule detail, it doesn't make sense to adorn the cover of such a fantastically rich novel with that. The other thing: the title. Again, I saw the reference, made by Dixon Dufresnes at the very end, but it just seemed off. I wonder if Ms. Tartt had any say in either of these decisions.The only thing I'm unhappy with at the end of this engrossing coming-of-age story, is that I've run out of books to read by Donna Tartt. And I don't want to wait until 2024 for the next one!"
10,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5293536-melki,Rating 4 out of 5,"Oh, Harriet, you poor dear. Twelve and a half, homely and unpopular. The girl with the antique-sounding name and possessor of an ""old soul."" She has a gruff, common sense approach to life that eschews flattery and wins her few fans among her peers and relatives.In vain, the aunts tried to teach her to be polite. ""But don't you understand, darling,"" said Tat, ""that if you don't like the fruitcake, it's better to eat it anyway instead of hurting your hostess's feelings?""""But I don't like fruitcake.""""I know you don't Harriet. That's why I used that example.""""But fruitcake is horrible. I don't know anybody that likes it. And if I tell her I like it, she's just going to keep on giving it to me.""You certainly can't argue with that logic.Harriet was just a babe, plopped down in a wind-up swing, when her 9-year-old brother was murdered in the family's yard during a Mother's Day celebration.Now, her older sister mostly sleeps and cries. Her mother is mostly sedated. She is raising herself with the help of a stern grandmother, a gaggle of great-aunts and the housekeeper. Having nothing in common with girls her age, she hangs out with a passel of boys; enough boys so that they can play the apostles to her Jesus in a reenactment of the Last Supper. (This was one of my favorite parts of the book!)Her biggest goals for the summer? Avoid going to church camp and win the library summer reading contest. (Who could not LOVE this girl?) Oh, and she's decided to solve the murder of her brother, committed so many years ago. This bit of Nancy Drewism will land her smack dab in a nest of vipers (literally), and deep into the dangerous world of a family of meth-dealing ne'er-do-wells. This seems to be a love it/hate it title. I can see why it's not for everyone. The pacing is slow and languid, much like the Mississippi summer setting of the book. Things take their own sweet time unfolding. Many of the characters are not likable. And, yeah, there are unanswered questions. I kept reading because I was in love with Harriet. As one character describes her, 
...Harriet was not sweet or whimsical by any stretch of the imagination. Harriet was a trip.
And that she was...With distaste, Harriet reflected upon how life had beaten down the adults she knew, every single grown up. Something strangled them as they grew older, made them doubt their own powers - laziness? Habit? Their grip slackened; they stopped fighting and resigned themselves to what happened. ""That's Life."" That's what they all said. ""That's Life, Harriet, that's just how it is, you'll see."" Well, Harriet would not see. She was young still, and the chains had not grown tight around her ankles. Whatever was to be done she would do it. She would strike now--while she still could, before her nerve broke and her spirit failed her--with nothing to sustain her but her own gigantic solitude.She is gonna grow up to be one heckuva woman!"
11,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3639005-candi,Rating 5 out of 5,"“For the rest of her life, Charlotte Cleve would blame herself for her son’s death because she had decided to have the Mother’s Day dinner at six in the evening instead of noon, after church, which is when the Cleves usually had it.”I adore a book that grabs you right from the first sentence! It’s true that this book is not The Goldfinch. It’s not The Secret History. The truth is that The Little Friend is a rightful masterpiece all on its own! It doesn’t need the success of those two masterful novels to raise it a notch or two in terms of literary greatness. It reaches that level based on its individual merits. I’d have to say that Donna Tartt knows exactly what it takes to write a damn good story – and she’s not going to rush her writing with the aim to publish quickly at the risk of jeopardizing what she knows in her heart is needed to produce a perfect book: time, patience, tons of skill, and of course, a profound understanding of human psychology and social interactions. Her books range anywhere from 550 to over 800 pages, yet I couldn’t point out one wasted word or moment in her stories. Some readers won’t necessarily agree with that, but I couldn’t imagine a better way to spend my time in the world of her characters. “She did not care for children’s books in which the children grew up, as what ‘growing up’ entailed (in life as in books) was a swift and inexplicable dwindling of character; out of a clear blue sky the heroes and heroines abandoned their adventures for some dull sweetheart, got married and had families, and generally started acting like a bunch of cows.”Twelve-year-old Harriet Cleve Dufresnes is one of those wholly unforgettable characters. Yes, she’s still a child, but this novel is not told in a childlike fashion. It’s told from the perspective of the wise, all-seeing narrator that understands child psychology and behavior. If you recall your own childhood, despite the likely differences in setting (Mississippi, early 1970s), you can’t help but identify with even just a piece of Harriet’s personality – especially if you were a solitary child that sought refuge between the pages of a book. I’d hazard a guess this would include the majority of us here! See, the “problem” with addictive reading at a young age is that it makes us book-wise beyond our years. I say “problem” because this doesn’t necessarily translate into wisdom concerning people and the world at large. It sometimes distorts our impressions and our expectations of people – both the good guys and the bad guys. We may not understand that there is something in between the good and the bad. That gray area evades the young mind. At least, I know this to be true for my younger self – and this is the case for Harriet as well. “Running might take her forward, it could even take her home; but it couldn't take her back–not ten minutes, ten hours, not ten years or days.”In any case, Harriet is a richly portrayed character. She’s on a mission to find the person responsible for the death of her brother a decade ago, an event that forever damaged her family when she was still a baby. It is with this premise that the book begins, but it turns into a whole lot more than a thriller. In fact, the pace would probably vex anyone expecting the brisk gallop that a thriller provides. It would be better to call this a literary coming-of-age story with a mystery lurking at the edges throughout. HOWEVER, there are some super tense scenes in this novel that I can’t imagine even the most devoted thriller reader wouldn’t appreciate! Oh, and the bad guys are creepy as hell! I’d say this is southern gothic at its finest when it comes to the descriptions and actions of the Ratliff family. From the decrepit old grandmother, Gum, to the meth heads Farish and Danny, to the sinister-looking criminal-turned-preacher Eugene, Donna Tartt illustrates such a vivid picture of this dysfunctional family that I couldn’t help but fear I might stumble upon them myself should I ever venture into their part of the world. The other ancillary characters are unforgettable as well – the devoted friend Hely, Edie, the stoic grandmother, and Ida Rhew, the housekeeper who is more of a mother-figure than the broken, emotionally absent mother herself. Oh, and the great-aunts – oh my, those aunts!!Read this for the nuanced characters, the polished and descriptive writing, and for the riveting storytelling. I could have spent another two weeks or more in the company of even the vilest of these people, but especially in the head of the precocious, spirited and often reckless Harriet! What a novel! Now if only I could muster up some of the patience of Donna Tartt as I wait to see if she decides to share more of her genius with her fans!“Even if it meant that she had failed, she was glad. And if what she'd wanted had been impossible from the start, still there was a certain lonely comfort in the fact that she'd known it was impossible and had gone ahead and done it anyway.”"
12,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4196681-violet-wells,Rating 3 out of 5,"Donna Tartt always gives me more information than I need. Two people will be talking and you get a description of all the furniture in the room, a description of what's on TV, a description of what's going on outside the window, sometimes a memory, sometimes a dream before the dialogue is resumed. Thus it can take pages for two characters to exchange four lines of dialogue. In this novel she also gives me too many characters. As always with Tartt it’s crime that motors this novel. In particular the effect a mysterious murder has on the family of the dead boy. Harriet, the boy’s younger sister, is at times a riveting portrait of troubled female adolescence. Her home life in a forsaken claustrophobic deep southern town was often brilliantly evoked. There’s a compelling portrait of a black housekeeper – not the usual sentimentalised fairy godmother figure of Hollywood who adores her little white wards but a mother so pinched by poverty and exploited by the family that she has little real affection to spare. Tartt is also a master at creating suspense. When she introduces into the narrative a born again preacher with crates of poisonous snakes the impulse is to get those pages turning quicker to reach the scene when the snakes are let loose, as we know they will be. But in this novel the denouements of the created suspense often fell a bit flat for me, sometimes straying into cartoonish melodrama. In fact the best parts of this novel were those depicting the inescapable claustrophobia and loneliness of life in an environment that has been forsaken. The high octane cinematic set pieces by comparison felt forced, superimposed. Ultimately there was a sense for me that the frame of this novel was too large for its canvas. "
13,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48483884-michael-finocchiaro,Rating 4 out of 5,"Donna Tartt's second novel (I am working my way backwards from The Goldfinch). While I am still puzzled as to who is the ""little friend"" referred to in the title (Hely?) and the choreography of the end at the water tank was confusing, nonetheless this was an exciting page-turner and I feel that the protagonist Harriet was compelling. I loved her curiosity, her brilliance, and her spunk - she is not one to be double-crossed. The evocation of Alexandria, Mississippi reminded me greatly of my childhood in Florida. Tartt's mastery of language and description is impressive. The dream sequence of Harriet during The Blackbird chapter was mesmerizing (transitioning from Scott's failed expedition to the South Pole to an Harry Houdini escape applauded by penguins) amd highly memorable. The dialogs (particularly among Harriet's aunts) are also highly realistic as are her onomatopoeia such as during The Pool Hall:""Crack. The balls spun apart. Odum walked to the opposite side and studied the table for several momentd. Then he popped his neck quickly, by swinging it to one side, and leaned down to make his shot."" (P. 199) I felt like I was sitting at the bar (or hidden with Harriet observing the scene. Another descriptive passage later impressed me:""The street lamps were not yet lit; the air smelled like hedge clippings, and bug spray, and honeysuckle. Rose beds blazed magenta and carmine and Tropicana orange in the fading light."" (P. 266) Again, it was like I was on a bike next to Harriet and Hely.Later during The Red Gloves when they are up on the overpass, it was like they were""Shipwrecked on a desert planet...flapping flags, military funeral for the casualties...homemade crosses in the dust. Back on the horizon, the sparse lights of an alien settlement: hostile, probably, enemies of the Federation."" (P. 316)The themes of southern memories of the Civil War and slavery, everyday racism, and the strained relationships between the prosperous (and less prosperous) whites with the subjugated blacks (notably that of the maids Odean and Ida with their respective employers) provided a realistic background to the story and reflected my own observations from living in the south. Harriet was a big reader and frequently there are references (such as ""shipwrecked"" above) to kids books like Treasure Island that added to the realism of Harriet and Hely's perspectives. There were also lots of bird images - particularly blackbirds - and knowing her next book is The Goldfinch, one would guess that Tartt is an avid bird lover. Another theme (which appears at the very end (no spoilers I promise) is being trapped underwater. For example,""She dreamed of black swamp water with ice in it, and country paths she had to run down again and again with a splinter in her foot from being barefoot( of swimming upward through dark lakes, knocking her head against a sheet of metal that sealed her underwater, away from the surface air"" (P. 415). And again the theme of persistent memory:""Melancholy black drips of decay streaked the tank's facade from top to bottom - but even though it wasn't really there any more, the devil face, still it burned in Harriet's memory, like a light's afterburn ina recently darkened room."" (P. 433)So many things about the south came back to me, like this:""They were old kitchen curtains: Danny still didn't know what Coriander was, or Mace, but he could still see the brown letters jingling along the mustard-yellow cotton (mace, nutmeg, coriander, clove) and the very names were a poem..."" (P. 470)I am nearly sure my mom had those same curtains or a tablecloth just like that.There were dozens of moments where I remembered Vacation Bible School and Christian summer camp because they were so thoughtfully evoked.While not a perfect book, The Little Friend is a great one where even the bad guy, Danny, is revealed in all his imperfect humanity and all the characters are relatively three dimensional. I am planning to read The Secret History when the American Library of Paris gets it back in stock and then will impatiently wait Tartt's next book. She is truly and exceptionally gifted storyteller and I derive immense pleasure from her writing. Love Donna Tartt!"

However, this book was the biggest cocktease ever. Chekhov once said that if a gun is laying on the table in the first scene it had better be fired by the last. I firmly believe this, but Ms. Tartt seems not to. Oh well. It just seems that if you begin a book with a nine-year-old boy hanging dead from a tree, and the entire plot is driven from this, something should happen in the 555 pages of (sometimes incredibly indulgent) exposition. You'd think. Yes, she was describing class distinction and how families can be destroyed and decay, bladdy blah. I'd recommend reading A Member of the Wedding if you want to see that instead. But if you start a suspense novel and then morph it into a long-winded descriptive about redneck meth-heads mixed in with a coming of age story in the deep south...no! Pick a plot, please!Another thing I have a personal pet peeve of is Black Mammy Characters. You know, at one time in history...like in the Civil War...we were incredibly limited as a culture as viewing black people as, I don't know, human. This is the 21st Century however, and despite the fact that people actually think the tv show Weeds is funny, it wouldn't hurt to at least try to explore the revolutionary idea that black people are human and have a vocabulary that is not limited to speaking like Jim from Huckleberry Finn. I hate when *white* authors attempt to write black characters by using tired phonetic spelling that is just so fucking sadly offensive it makes me embarrassed for them. Now, I realize that the character of Ida didn't at all times rely on sad cliches...she just did most of the time. That whole part about her not really giving a shit about the kids was probably pretty accurate. But seriously, Hattie McDaniel died a long time ago and I'm really not sure they'll be able to find a Black Mammy stock actor to play Ida in the made-for-tv movie (on a side note, I think that Jenna Malone is too old for Harriet, but the mental casting the author did was really dead-on). Really, the bottom line is that the world needs another faux Southern Gothic quasi-racial drama like a hole in the head. The world doesn't need anymore Mammies...that's what that bottle of Aunt Jamima maple syrup is for. Just eat some damned pancakes, enjoy your racial superiority, and quit writing cliche Mammies...PLEASE! This book could have been great, but instead it was incredibly mediocre. I still don't think she's a bad writer, she's actually quite talented and has a real knack for creating mood...but man, learn when to fire that damned gun Ms. Tartt!"

For the rest of her life, Charlotte Cleve would blame herself for her son's death because she had decided to have the Mother's Day dinner at six in the evening instead of noon, after church, which is when the Cleves usually had it.

 So begins this Southern gothic pseudomystery comedy of errors. We meet the Cleve-Dufresnes where we primarily follow Harriet, a precocious over-read 12 year old who takes it upon herself to find her brother's killer nearly a decade later. However, she doesn't sleuth. She doesn't investigate. She doesn't seek clues or answers. A young strange girl who has an aversion to puberty and convention. She's not like other girls. When she runs off to Bible camp after accidentally unleashing venomous snakes on her enemies (who don't even know she exists), she's encouraged to join a group of girls where they can learn more about adolescence. 
Harriet felt as though one of the gruesome transparencies of “Your Developing Body”—all womb, and tubes, and mammaries—had been projected over her poor dumb body; as if all anybody saw when they looked at her—even with her clothes on—were organs and genitalia and hair in unseemly places. Knowing that it was inevitable (“just a natural part of growing up!”) was no better than knowing that someday she would die. Death, at least, was dignified: an end to dishonor and sorrow.
 For Harriet, the most important thing was how other people should be beholden to her whims. This book starts out as a mystery. Or perhaps that was Ms Tartt's intention in the beginning. But as the story continues, it loses itself in the colourful lives of the Dufresnes--a family that's suffering from an identity crisis (much like this book). They're no longer the southern noblesse they once were. They're now a hastily decelerating royal family that's deep in denial. About their stature, which is falling apart as much as their patriarchal home, a former plantation home called Tribulation. Apt. It feels as though Robin's death was the loose thread that caused this whole facade to unravel. On the opposite end of the spectrum, and the other family that we follow, are the Ratliffs. A ragtag downtrodden caricature of white trash. They live in trailers, one of which is used as a meth laboratory. But even while manufacturing one of the world's most profitable narcotics, they remain dirt poor. As of 2002, crystal meth retailed for $30,000 a pound. How did they remain so poor? They were an unfortunate lot. From their matriarch Gum, a woman who'd rather see her grandsons wallow than attempt to dig themselves out of the vortex of poverty. 
“my diddy said it was something wrong with any man that’ll sit down in a chair and read a book.” This she said with a sort of peaceful tenderness, as if the plain wisdom of the remark did her father credit…Holding it at arm’s length, she looked at the front of it and she turned it around and looked at the back, “Bless ye heart, Gene… I hate to see ye get your hopes up. It’s a hard old world for folks like us. I sure do hate to think of all them young college professors, standing up in the job line ahead of you.”
 This is a common theme in this book. Awareness and response to class. There's a brief touch on how it intersects with race but this isn't the novel where we explore such a complex topic, especially in a state such as Mississippi. But you can also attest to the exploration of grief in this story. The Ratliffs and their circle of friends are a sorry lot. Eugene, one of the boys and the most religious of them all, believes there's a divine purpose to all their suffering. Farish and Danny, the ones with the meth lab, are more concerned with trying to force their way to joy. Danny, to riches. But Farish, a vet who with a spotty past or at least his memory of his service is doubtful, is paranoid and belligerent. He would kill Danny if he so much as suspected that Danny side-eyed their stash. The Ratfiffs grieve what would have been if they weren't descendants of Gum. If they didn't have an abusive father. If they'd been born as wealthy as the Dufresnes. The Dufresnes grieve little Robin, whose death seemed to suck the joy and possibility out of their lives. Robin and Harriet's mother, Charlotte, was ""turned to stone"" by grief. Allison, who was old enough to remember what happened to Robin but has no idea what she witnessed, is turned into a robotic hypersomniac who exists to annoy Harriet with her ghostly haunting through the halls of their home. Charlotte weaves in and out of fugue and awareness, constantly annoying her daughters with her clumsy attempts at friendship rather than parenting. The only parent Harriet ever really knows, is their nanny and domestic manager Ida. A Black woman who is a mild subversion of the mammy trope. And another victim of Harriet's impulsivity and expected to dance to the latest of Harriet's whims. Ida eventually exacts her agency in a way that has Harriet briefly reckoning with her family's role in the perpetuation of the cycle of poverty with their unfair labour practices. Harriet has the grace to be embarrassed by what her family does but it doesn't dive deeper. There's a shallow quality to the story. It's a hypnotic weave that leaves you befuddled by the spell it binds you with. Occasionally, you remember that you want to find out who killed Robin, but like a spellcaster, Tartt convinces you that it's unnecessary. This story takes a life of its own. However, it's a formless beating manifestation. At times claustrophobic, this story will not hesitate to disgust you. It's raw. Artless. Harrowing. As though Tartt was answering to critics only privy to her. The Ratliffs cover up their meth lab with a taxidermy operation. You will not forget how dank it is. 
Danny was sick of it nearly to vomiting. Part cat piss, part formaldehyde, part rot and death, it had penetrated nearly everything: clothes and furniture, water and air, his grandmother’s plastic cups and dishes. His brother smelled so strongly of it you could hardly stand within six feet of him and, once or twice, Danny had been horrified to detect a whiff of it in his own sweat.
 This story is not for fans of The Secret History seeking to revel in the prior decadent glory of intellectual literati out to invoke gods. This is a muck-filled story. A moist opera that doesn't let you forget. It doesn't let your attention wander. Once it grabs you, it injects its ugliness in you, with cruel jagged fangs that leave you torn open and raw. Be it from the casual racism of the characters, the erasure of humanity, the cruelty, the impatience... All of it just boils down to a pus-filled abscess of a story with a zephyr lily growing out of it. There are no likeable characters in this book, except Ida. There are moments that will leave a ringing memory of The Secret History. But you'd have to be a keen-eyed Tartt reader to see it. This book is the opposite of her debut in every way possible. I can't yet decide if this is a good thing. However, this book is definitely the worst mystery I've ever loved."

I hate the word ""evocative,"" because it seems terribly pretentious…like “terribly pretentious” doesn’t sound pretentious at all, jeez, but this book is that. Evocative. Powerful, deep and dark, fascinating, poetic, and just overall beautifully written. Harriet is a firecracker, a pistol, a ""trip."" She's so completely herself and so completely relatable, it's almost eery. My childhood was nothing like Harriet's (maybe a little in that I spent a lot of time alone and got to where I preferred it that way), but I can remember feeling the way she feels, that anger and boredom and terror. My heart ached for her throughout the whole book. The rest of the characters are sharply drawn, as well, except when they’re meaningfully fuzzy. Allison, Charlotte, and Libby are intriguing in their weakness, their otherworldliness. If Tartt gets a little flowery with her language (I think she does, just a bit), I feel it’s justified. This is gothic, epic, real deep-down Suddenly Last Summer stuff, and it earns its flowers.I’ve read a few reviews saying nothing happens. I couldn’t disagree more. A LOT happens, it’s just that not a lot of it is overt; a lot happens on the inside of people. Since I’ve always lived in my head, I adored and related to the style of the thing.Yeesh, and the danger! There’s danger everywhere. I was so nervous the majority of the time. I was enjoying myself, drawn into the story, refusing to stop reading while simultaneously NOT wanting to read anymore, lest something (else) bad happened. Ugh. I loved it. It was beautifully done and deep and dark and gorgeous. I need a thesaurus, whatever. Love."

I had heard this was generally the least loved of Donna Tartt's novels, but I went into it expecting to like it a bit more than most because I adore her work. But no, sadly this was a big letdown. Overall this book just left me very confused. How did she go from such an atmospheric, well-written novel as  The Secret History to this? And then to come up with the masterpiece,  The Goldfinch? I just don't get how she is the same author of this book.The writing isn't bad, it's just not nearly to the caliber of her other novels. And you know those people, maybe friends or co-workers, who tell these long-winded stories and when they finish speaking, you're left going, ""...that's it?"" That basically sums up my feelings about this book. The whole time I was waiting for the story to arrive at some point where I could go, ""OH!! Yeah! Wow!"" and it would be redeemed. Sadly, it did not.A 1 star seems a bit harsh, because I suppose within the 555 pages there were some moments that kept me reading and interested. Though by the end I was SO over it, I just wanted to be done and know what happens. But even that didn't satisfy my enough to make it better. I'm really bummed because now I've read all 3 of her novels that are published, and I probably have to wait like 9 more years for another one. And this one didn't live up to the excellence of her other books. Ah well, at least I have The Goldfinch to appreciate."

And they were right.I should probably start with the most important question: who killed Robin? Because I thought, after all these pages of nothing, she could at least give us an answer about that. And this is what I'm mad about, to be clear. There's no other way to put it: there's too much garbage in here. Not just about the past, about all the tiny relations between the Cleves, the Ratliffs and whoever you can mention, but about everything: the weather, the houses, the gardens, the jobs; I don't need to know why she sneezes during allergies season in spring when it's August, no one needs to know!But even if summarizing is definitely not in Donna Tartt’s vocabulary, I kept going because of the truth about Robin’s death. I kept going because I thought that maybe she’d have made a big revelation in the end. Despite my frustration, and my poor judgment of the author at the moment, I can't say that this book is badly written because is, in fact, not. I like how she includes the past in a conversation that is happening right now, how she builds suspense little by little, and how she says things about the future when you least expect that.After this one, I honestly don't know what to expect from her other works. What I do know is that I'll wait to read them because deep down I know she deserves better than this from me, but this is all I can give for now.↠ 2 stars"

Well, I declare!
 I just don't know what Donna Tartt did to open the floodgates to venom for her last 2 novels: The Goldfinch, preceded by The Little Friend.I say this not to gripe about your subjective opinion that you found The Little Friend boring, you detested the subject matter, or you simply dislike Donna Tartt's writing style or personality. Intelligent people don't quibble over such matters, since opinions are like a__holes. I am also not claiming you are somehow misguided by animus if you gave it one or two stars ""just because I thought it stunk."" On the other hand, if you based your poor rating on your opinion that the novel lacked literary merit, I kindly ask you to consider the reviews of a legion of regularly published critics (those I could find on a recent search) who almost unanimously and certainly resoundingly applauded the worthiness of The Little Friend.I'll finish by offering my answers to criticism that the novel's subject matter or dialogue is unrealistic. Ms. Tartt is a couple of years older than I am, but we both grew up in small town Mississippi (for both of us, a majority of our formative years were spent in 1970s MS). I assure you that I know the characters in this novel, in a manner of speaking. Though I've never met Ms. Tartt, I've known these character traits, and feelings, and dialect and thought processes (or lack thereof), in both the young and the old. I am also very familiar with the setting, generally; yes, Mississippi has many water towers (and, btw, fire towers).Okay. Thank you. I needed to vent a little. I'll write a full review in the near future."

I read it a few years ago, I think it was in 2004, I don't really remember now, but I know it was before I separated from Fabio since during the separation process I only read books by Chris Bojalian and books that Lauren mailed me. She didn't mail me The Little Friend, but I'm sure it is she who recommended it. Just last night, I was talking with my friend Jenna about this book (which I convinced her to read, and which she is reading now) and we were cracking up over the part where Harriet gives her Sunday School teacher the drawing of the black spot. This is one of the most intriguing books in the history of writing. It should have won prizes, maybe it did. It's complicated but not overwhelming in its detail. It's clever without being overwrought. It's dark without making one want to be buried alive rather than finish a chapter. And it's Southern without being charming. Which is something to which I can relate."

I eventually had to go to a library miles away and check out the audio version so I didn't have to waste my precious eyesight reading it.

Their insights into life are often fascinating and engaging.I liked the way I simply forgot about time when the author drew me in, and although the plot moved forward slowly (even sideways sometimes) the setting and situations were lifelike and interesting enough to absorb my attention.Yes, it's long. Yes, it could have been trimmed quite a bit. Doing so, however, would have made this book something other than what it is- an immersive and well crafted read."
26,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56111743-roman-clodia,Rating 4 out of 5,"** Spoilers below ** I think the important thing about going into this book is to not expect it to be a murder mystery - there is a harrowing death which precipitates the story and which serves as a motivating force for the protagonist, 12 year old Harriet - but while she's on a search to find and punish the perpetrator, the book itself isn't. Instead, what we have here is a tricksy narrative where we as readers see beyond Harriet's childhood understandings, and I'd say the main thrust of the book is her introduction to an adult world which is more cruel, less resolved, even more arbitrary than the essentially benign and ordered world that Harriet imagines based on her reading of books like Treasure Island. In Tartt's version, children may go on adventures but they also may get things wrong, create mayhem, cause hurt, even - perhaps - be implicated in killings that they never intended. Along the way, Harriet also learns some hard home truths - that Ida, her beloved Black nanny and housekeeper, doesn't love her back. That her domestic world is built on inherited racism that feeds all the way down to her own parents who don't allow Ida to drink out of the same glasses as the family. That prejudices of class can skew her own conclusions and that someone involved in a meths lab might want to get away from his own lifestyle and might once have been 'the little friend'. For all the good stuff, the book is overlong and can feel directionless for a large part. I especially felt that long chapters following the snake-handling preacher (word of warning: lots of snakes here, including one horrific, if blackly comic, scene of a cobra being dropped into a topless car from a bridge...) and the Ratcliff family with their criminal enterprises disrupt the main narrative and I yearned to be back with Harriet and her family. There are lots of Southern tropes here: the generations of men-less women in Harriet's family, racism, classism, poverty, drugs, religion - and yes, all those snakes! In the end, I liked this more as a whole than I did during some of the chapters and it's Tartt's fluent writing and dark, dark sense of humour which kept me going.For what it's worth, my take on Robin? I think he died by accident, trying to 'fly' from the tree and got caught in the rope which strangled him. There are so many instances of people wanting to fly, dreaming of flying, including Alison's nightmares of flying. There are also mentions of Houdini's escapes, something that Robin can't manage, and Harriet's own self-suffocation as she tries to hold her breath in imitation of Houdini. The adults all know this, otherwise it's hard to believe that they wouldn't have been agitating for further police investigations, and there's no mention (I think) in the newspaper archives which Harriet is reading of this being an unsolved murder. The whole book, then, is built on Harriet's misunderstanding about Robin's death as well as her leap in error to who the perpetrator is."
27,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8655084-phrynne,Rating 3 out of 5,I listened to this book on audio and would like to comment first that the narrator was excellent and gave a huge boost to the atmosphere of the Mississippi setting.And the book had tremendous atmosphere. Donna Tartt has proven that she can set a scene with the best of them. She can also write a great character and Harriet in particular is superb. In fact another book focussing on her as a teenager or an adult would be great!My problem stemmed from my interest in Harriet and her family. I was fascinated by them all. Once the story switched to the Ratcliff family I lost interest and became irritated when page after page was spent on irrelevant side issues to do with their unpleasant lives. This was a long book and it took me a long time to listen to it. I liked it enough to finish it and the character of Harriet will stay with me. However it will not go down on my list of favourite books:)

29,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6700518-lorna,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Little Friend was a gorgeous southern gothic piece of literature by Donna Tartt set in Mississippi and in the vein of William Faulkner. We learn that there has been a murder of the family's little boy Robin occurring twelve years ago which is still affecting the Cleve family in profound ways. Harriett Cleve Dufresnes was a baby at the time of her brother's murder and her sister Allison, four years old and sitting on the porch with the baby that afternoon. 
""But Robin: their dear little Robs. More than ten years later, his death remained an agony; there was no glossing any detail; its horror was not subject to repair or permutation by any of the narrative devices that the Cleves knew. And--since this willful amnesia had kept Robin's death from being translated into that sweet old family vernacular which smoothed even the bitterest mysteries into comfortable, comprehensible form--the memory of that day's events had a chaotic, fragmented quality, bright mirror-shards of nightmare, which flared at the smell of wisteria, the creaking of a clothes-line, a certain stormy cast of spring light.""""Libby, in the worst days, had murmured something to her over and over again, something that she hadn't understood. We were never meant to have him, darling. He wasn't ours to keep. We were lucky he was with us for as long as he was.""""And this was the thought that came to Charlotte, through a narcotic fog, that hot morning in the shuttered room. That what Libby told her was the truth. And that, in some strange way or other, ever since he was just a baby, Robin had been trying to say goodbye to her all his life.""
At age twelve years, Harriet is determined to find her brother's killer and to come to terms with the past. It is during that lonely summer that Harriet is drawn deeper and deeper into her obsessions about learning the truth about Robin's death, and in her mind, exacting some form of revenge. It is with this colorful palette that Donna Tartt draws a picture of this dysfunctional family in the American South in the 1970s. There is a delightful extended family as well, the large Cleve family, the sisters of Harriet's grandmother Edie, all spinning many a story. They all love to reminisce about when the large family-owned plantation called Tribulation was the focal point of their childhood growing up in that iconic home. Donna Tartt also has the ability to slow time and focus on the narrative with her beautiful and descriptive prose. I love her writing. But because of Donna Tartt's mastery of suspense, this powerful book will keep one riveted to its startling conclusion. It certainly kept me up until the wee hours of the morning because I could not put the book down. Now the wait for Donna Tartt's next novel."
30,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2986010-francisco,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is one of Tartt's earlier books published before her acclaimed The Goldfinch. The same complexity and richness of character, the same explosion of detail that makes The Goldfinch so memorable can be found in a slightly less orderly way. Less orderly in the sense that this book didn't quite have the tight narrative structure where there is little that is told that is not important to the story. This book could have lost fifty or so pages without it affecting the plot line. But who cares, really, when those extra fifty pages are fascinating in their own right. This is a story of twelve-year-old Harriet. Like most of Donna Tartt's main characters, Harriet is, well, unusual. Unusual in the kind of way we all are, if someone got to know us as deeply as the author let's us know Harriet. Harriet's life is unusual too. She is motivated by the murder of her older brother when she was just a baby and her goal in life is to find the person who killed him and avenge his death. This simple plot line takes place in a small town in Mississippi and the characters that inhabit this world are both recognizable and like no-one you've ever met before. Now and then, if you like to write, you run into books that are worth reading at least a couple of times. The first time just for the pleasure of it and the second time, more carefully, to observe how the author pulled it off. This is one of those books. Especially if you, like me, are a fan of the omniscient narrator. You know the kind that jumps into the minds of twenty or so characters without missing a beat. When you read this kind of book you get the sense of someone conducting a one-hundred piece orchestra, of a hundred instruments losing themselves to produce one musical experience. The other thing you learn from a book like this, if you like to write, is that writing is all about the concrete, the particular, the hard atoms of life and spirit that make our world and our lives. Here's writing behind which you can detect expertise on muscle-cars, amphetamines, Houdini, revolvers, snake handling preachers (and snakes), summer camps, the Bible, the Civil War, to mention just a few. You have to be grateful for people like Tartt who give years of their lives to first acquire and then transform this expertise into an an art that enriches you and me."

32,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17778059-lyubov,Rating 4 out of 5,"Понякога смятам, че очакванията (каквито и да са те) могат да съсипят удоволствието от дадена книга, от друга страна обаче те биха могли дори да задълбочат самото изживяване. Аз имах тонове информация за „Малкият приятел” на Дона Тарт, но с немалко усилие на волята и самодисциплина се опитах да подходя към книгата с чисто съзнание, до колкото това изобщо беше възможно.Романът се чете бавно и то не само заради своя обем. Никога не съм разбирала читателите, които не смеят да посегнат към дадена книга с довода: „Ама тя е много дебела”. Просто самата история се разгъва бавно и лениво като змия, припичаща се на слънце. На моменти е толкова наситена с болка и смътно предчувствие за нещо ужасяващо, че засяда на гърлото като шоколад със 70% какао. Да, обичаш го, да искаш да хапнеш още от него, но просто не можеш да го преглътнеш, идва ти твърде много и трябва са спреш за малко, за да дойдеш на себе си. Но дори и когато правиш пауза за глътка въздух прашното какао е още в гърлото ти. Усещаш го, драска те, но и те тегли обратно към себе си.„Малкият приятел” не е криминална история, въпреки че започва с внезапната смърт на едно 9 годишно момченце. Това всъщност е зловеща приказка в най-добрите традиции на братя Грим, където децата ще бъдат затворени в клетката на собствените си страхове, където няма да има избавление накрая и където дебне нещо страховито, притаено в храстите...и това е самият живот. Главната героиня Хариет ще си остане едно от любимите ми приказни момиченца, което не е нито хубаво, нито мило. То е просто умно и много, много тъжно. Няма да навлизам в подробности от сюжета, той е единствено и само за лично изживяване. Просто ще цитирам един от любимите ми откъси от книгата, защото думите на Дона Тарт говорят сами за себе си:„По-късно, когато Хариет си припомняше този ден, ѝ се струваше, че това бе точната, ясна, научно обоснована точка, когато животът ѝ кривна към страданието. Ако трябва да бъдем честни, тя открай време не беше точно щастлива или доволна, но беше съвсем неподготвена за непознатата тъмнина, която се бе изпречила пред нея...Един напълно нов, грозен начин на живот се спускаше над Хариет, там, в тъмния коридор до масичката с телефона и макар че тогава ѝ се струваше нов, през идните седмици той щеше да ѝ стане мъчително познат.”„Малкият приятел” не притежава всепомитащата мащабност на „Щиглецът”, нито великолепния, режещ като бръснач елитарен дух на „Тайната история”. Това е един съвсем друг свят, който или ще ви заплени безнадеждно, или ще ви отврати, но в никакъв случай няма да ви остави безразлични. А най-голямата сила на един писател според мен, е да бъде различен във всяка една своя книга. И Дона Тарт го постига великолепно."
33,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3236194-caroline,Rating 2 out of 5,"***NO SPOILERS***(Full disclosure: book abandoned at page 226, out of 555 pages)The Little Friend starts strong, with distinct, even lovable characters--and protagonist Harriet is the most interesting of all--but 141 pages in, it loses its footing. Readers should be forewarned that despite The Little Friend’s summary, this isn’t a murder mystery. The mysterious murder is a background concern, a persistent nagging on the edge of twelve-year-old Harriet’s consciousness. The story is really about--within the first 226 pages, that is--the day-to-day life and antics of Harriet and her cute friend Hely, and the pace is very leisurely, peppered with complex, often beautiful sentences. It’s also an entertaining character portrait of some charming Southern personalities. This is no urgently paced, heart-pounding murder mystery. These characters sit and laze away oppressively humid summer days, and that’s how Donna Tartt wanted the reader to digest this story--to sit with it. When the focus shifts from Harriet’s colorful family to a set of less interesting, less distinctive characters, the story slows considerably. Part of the problem is that this set of characters--brothers Harriet suspects were involved in her brother’s murder--blends together. Tartt tried (one, for instance, is mentally disabled; one is described--impressively--as resembling a bear), but they just don’t stand out, and it’s a burden to keep track of who is who. The story is no longer much fun to read and definitely isn’t a page-turner. A skimming of the remaining 329 pages reveals that these characters continue to take center stage, so apparently the story never reclaims the engaging tone of its earlier pages. It must be said that the writing isn’t problematic; it really is the story itself. The actual artistry of Tartt’s writing is, as has always been true of her, of the highest order. This definitely is the same author who lovingly strung together the stunning sentences of The Secret History and The Goldfinch. The Little Friend shouldn’t be one’s first experience with Tartt’s work. Goodreads’s low average rating is right; this is Tartt’s weakest. It doesn’t maintain momentum the way The Secret History and The Goldfinch do. Skipping this one won’t be any loss."
34,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/272909-blair,Rating 4 out of 5,"I've owned my copy of this book for years. I think something in me must've just known it was the right time to read it. I read one chapter a night for a week – this book is 555 pages, and there are only six chapters, so really each chapter is more like a novella. I read it through a heatwave; unusual weather for where I live. This atmosphere – the heavy, hot air that paradoxically conjures up a feeling of perpetual restlessness, and that inevitably reminds you of childhood summers – seemed a perfect match for the setting and plot.I loved the richness of The Little Friend, the sheer lush extravagance of the prose. Whenever I was reading it, I was completely immersed. When I was away from it, I looked forward to re-entering its world. It strikes me that there's something very old-fashioned about this type of storytelling – its slowness and detail, the sense that the author is taking her time.I sometimes read descriptions Donna Tartt has written and think there's nobody who can match her:An icy fresh wind blew through his head. The pool-room's seedy, contaminated mood—all heeltaps and grime—waxed bright and clean and comical all of a sudden.A despairing glassine shiver ran down Danny's neck as he sped past the funeral home. Airy methamphetamine clarity gliddered over him in nine hundred directions simultaneously.Harriet was going to be in the eighth grade next year, and what she had not expected was the horrifying new indignity of being classed—for the first time ever—a ""Teen Girl"": a creature without mind, wholly protuberance and excretion... The haze of deodorant and ""hygiene"" sprays in the changing rooms; the stubbly leg hair, the greasy lip gloss; everything was tainted with a slick oil of ""puberty"", of obscenity, right down to the sweat on the hot dogs... Knowing that it was inevitable (""just a natural part of growing up!"") was no better than knowing that someday she would die.Where 
The Secret History
 was tightly focused and plotted, The Little Friend is sprawling and ponderous in its approach, yet small in its horizons, confined to this Mississippi community where everyone knows everyone else's business. It makes sense, then, that the protagonist is a child, since a small town seems like a universe when you're 12. (The Goldfinch is the bridge between the two – a big, broad story, but not as loose as this.)The Little Friend gets a lot of flak for initially presenting the plot as a sort of whodunnit and then never resolving that element. I don't think the problem here is necessarily that the mystery isn't solved – after a while it became irrelevant to me, and I was dimly aware from an early stage that it would probably never be wrapped up neatly. It's more that its presence makes it feel like Tartt doesn't trust the reader to be hooked without a mystery. If there was another >500-page story of these characters just going about their lives, I'd read it, no question. But I can understand why some find it frustrating that what is, at first, the plot's most intriguing question is never answered.TinyLetter | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr"

On the other hand, expectations can only infrequently enhance one's experience of a book. It took me three attempts, years apart, to get through The Little Friend ... but it was worth it! A wonderful book, and a unique heroine, young Harriet. Just read patiently and you will be richly rewarded. At first I wanted to give this book 4½ stars ... actually more like 4.4 because I'd ""rounded down"" to 4 ... but then something interesting happened ... I felt like I wanted to reread the book even though it hadn't been very long since I'd (yes, finally!) finished it. I wanted to re-immerse myself in the amazingly rich, strange, dark, frightening, alternatively heartbreaking and hilarious world of Harriet and her quest to find out who killed her brother Robin.So ... unlike many readers here, I came to The Little Friend with zero expectations ... and, as advertised, once I was properly ""immersed"", I loved it. Did the author do my bidding for me and tell me everything I might have wanted to know by the story's end? No, but I don't ultimately believe that it makes sense to scold or berate an author for not writing a different book than the one she actually did write. To fully appreciate any book, but especially a book like this, we need – I certainly needed – to ""surrender"" to, to accept, the author's offering, on her own terms. Having done that, and on rereading it, I have to revise: 5 stars."

The audiobook is read by Karen White  —25 hours and 3 minutes or—the book is 640 pagesThere are already around 5,000 reviews— so another one from me describing the plot is not needed. But here are a few things to share:  “The owl and the pussycat went to seaIn a beautiful pea-green boat They took some honey and plenty of money Wrapped up in a five-pound note . . .” “There she was, embroidering, with her tiny silver scissors hung on a pink ribbon around her neck, working to crossword or reading a biography of Madame de Pompadour, talking to her little white cat . . . tip tip tip, Harriet could hear her footsteps now, the particular sound of them, and her size three shoe, tip tip tip down the long hallway to answer the telephone. Libby! How glad Libby always seemed when Harriet called—even late at night—as if there were no one else in the world whose voice she had wanted to hear! ‘Oh! It’s my darling!’ she cried; ‘how ‘sweet’ of you to call your poor old auntie . . . ; and the gaiety and warmth of her voice thrilled. So much that (even alone, standing by the wall phone in the dark kitchen) she shut her eyes and hung her head, warmed and glowing all over, like a chimed bell”.  “With distaste, Harriet reflected upon how life had beaten down the adults she knew, every single grown-up. Something strangled them as they grew older, made them doubt their powers—laziness? Habit? Their grip slackened; they stopped fighting and resigned themselves to what happened. That’s life. That’s what they all said. That’s life,., That’s just how it is, you see”.  “Well: Harriet would ‘not’ see. She was still young, and the chains had not yet grown tight around her ankles. For years, she lived in terror of turning nine—Robin was nine when he died— but her ninth birthday had come and gone, and now she wasn’t afraid of anything”. Harriet learned things in life that she never had imagined learning!!! Haven’t we all! Thank you Lorna….. for your very inspiring and encouraging review. I don’t know why there are so many low stars. Or why I waited so long to read it. Donna Tartt is a fabulous storyteller!"

Λάθος. Δυστυχώς η απογοήτευση ξεκίνησε αρκετά νωρίς μιας και ενώ το βιβλίο ξεκινά με μια δυνατή αρχή με την ιστορία ενός μικρού αγοριού που βρίσκεται δολοφονημένο κατω από αδιευκρινιστες συνθήκες(εκεί κάπου τρίβεις τα χέρια με ικανοποίηση και λες νάτο το φονικό που θα απασχολήσει και θα δημιουργήσει όλη αυτή τη μυστηριωδη, σκοτεινή ατμόσφαιρα που με είχε συνεπάρει στο πρώτο βιβλίο της Ταρτ), στη συνέχεια το βιβλίο εξελίσσεται σε.. all over the place.

38,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11501632-boris,Rating 5 out of 5,"""Малкият приятел"" е първото заглавие, което чета, написано от Дона Тарт. Покрай ""Щиглецът"" съм чувал какви ли не коментари за Дона Тарт, повечето от които представляваха критики към обема и многословието й. Във връзка с това имам няколко впечатления от ""Малкият приятел"", които обясняват защо е многословна и защо това й качество е блестящо.Дона Тарт е страхотен разказвач в перспектива. В ""Малкият приятел"" има дузина герои и това, което тя успява да изгради с тях е удивително. Всеки герой плува в свое собствено море от ""думи"" и можеш да идентифицираш гледната точка на всеки един от тях без допълнителна помощ от разказвача. Без да следва комерсиалният модел да пише по глава за всеки герой, Дона Тарт успява със седем дълги части да разкаже история, която съдържа гледната точка на десетки пълнокръвни образа. В момента, в който разказвачът използва дефиницията ""тъп"", усещаш че я използва през перспективата на един определен герой, за който даването на такава оценка е характерно. Аз съм читател, който обича думите, играта с тях и умното им използване. Надявам се да открия същият тип многословие и в другите романи на Дона Тарт; тя дава добри уроци за какво служат думите на болшинството от писатели, които се напъват да пускат по 2 книги на година.Описанията. Описанията са в изобилие и това не е самоцелен каприз на Дона Тарт. В една история, която дискутира тема като ""загубата"", експонирана в десетки конфликти у десетки герои, Дона успява да подплъти действието и развитието с това, което е извън героите - природата, залезът, сенките на слънцето, падащи върху панталоните (къде гледа човек, когато е притеснен? в панаталоните на някой, който стои срещу него). Предполагам, че има читатели, които си падат по ""специални ефекти"" и най-вероятно Дона Тарт не е техният автор. Един съвет преди прочит - непрекъснато търсете ""Малкият приятел"" сред героите. Надявам се да не го откриете и да бъдете изненадани така, както аз, когато господин Дюфрен разкрива поантата.И не на последно място - реализмът. Дона Тарт за мен е по-добър разказвач от Лев Толстой. Следваща по реда си е ""Щиглецът""."

The vivid descriptions of nature and setting and the complexity of the characters made me feel like I was standing in a childhood memory of my own, even though my childhood wasn't anything like Harriet’s. Harriet and Allison will forever have a very special place in my heart. This entire book just feels like a warm late summer’s night playing with friends from your street after dinner. It’s so dreamlike but also so melancholic and eerie. Allison’s melancholic otherwordliness and the decay of the house as well as the family reminded me of the Lisbon sisters in “The Virgin Suicides”. The Little Friend is a very beautiful and a fascinating study on grief, however it is very slow so I do recommend using the audiobook to get through some of the more dense and tedious parts - but I honestly can’t wait to reread this book"

Ποιο ακριβώς; Με τρία βιβλία στο ενεργητικό της, όλα τους ογκωδέστατα, και με το καθένα να μετρά δέκα χρόνια συγγραφής η Ταρτ έχει φτιάξει γύρω της μια ασαφή δημιουργική αύρα. Πέραν του τιτάνιου όγκου τους, δεν είναι εύκολο να πει κανείς γιατί χρειάστηκαν τόσο πολύ για να γραφτούν αυτά τα βιβλία. Έχει κάτι το ύφος τους που παραπλανά. Η γλώσσα είναι άμεση και την ίδια στιγμή περίπλοκη - οι φράσεις της, συνήθως, ούτε κοφτές, ούτε τεράστιες, είναι περιγραφικές και το λεξιλόγιό της μπορεί να συνδυάζει το άμεσο και το προφορικό με δυσεύρετες λέξεις. Η Καρδερίνα, το τελευταίο της βιβλίο, απασχόλησε τον λογοτεχνικό και όχι μόνο τύπο, όσα λίγα βιβλία την χρονιά της κυκλοφορίας του.Τελικά, τι διάολο γράφει η Ντόνα Ταρτ; Το πρώτο της βιβλίο, Η Μυστική Ιστορία, αν και με σαγήνευσε με τις αρετές του, τελικά κατάφερε να με εξοργίσει με την βραδυφλεγή πλοκή του. Η Καρδερίνα θεώρησα πως, χωρίς να είναι το καλύτερο βιβλίο του κόσμου -ποιο είναι άλλωστε;- ανταπεξήλθε στις προσωπικές μου προσδοκίες και αποτέλεσε ένα από τα πιο συμπαγή και ενδιαφέροντα τούβλα που έχω διαβάσει. Όμως ακόμα δεν είχα καταλάβει αν μας δουλεύει η Τάρτ. Μετά από τον Μικρό Φίλο, νομίζω είμαι λίγο πιο κοντά στην αλήθεια.Κατ΄ αρχάς το βιβλίο είναι κτηνωδώς μεγάλο. Εν μέσω των τριών τούβλων της Ταρτ τούτο εδώ ξεχωρίζει, αγγίζοντας τις χίλιες σελίδες. Ένα τόσο γιγάντιο βιβλίο πάντα γεννά την απορία στον αναγνώστη: μα τι στο καλό γράφει εκεί μέσα η συγγραφέας; Η διήγηση ξεκινάει με την τριτοπρόσωπη φωνή να μας ενημερώνει η Σάρλοτ Κλιβ θα έχει ως άχθος ανείπωτο τον θάνατο του γιου της για όλη της την ζωή. Αμέσως σκέφτηκα πως αν αυτό είναι και το αναγνωστικό άχθος για τις 1000 σελίδες του βιβλίου, περιμένω να με εντυπωσιάσει. Γιατί όπως και αν το κάνουμε ένα τετελεσμένο δράμα που θα στοιχειώσει τους ζώντες ήρωες, καλό είναι να μην στοιχειώσει και την ανάγνωσή μου.Η πρωταγωνίστρια, Χάριετ, αδερφή του αποθανόντος, ανήσυχο πνεύμα, μεγαλώνει με την καταρρακωμένη, πια, μάνα της, την ρομαντική αδερφή της και τις χαριτωμένες θείες της. Έχει και έναν φιλαράκο από τον σχολείο με τον οποίο σκαρώνουν διαολιές και παιχνίδια, όπως όλα τα παιδάκια της ηλικίας του δημοτικού. Η Ταρτ επικεντρώνει την ιστορία της γύρω από την μικρή Χάριετ. Πράγμα, όμως, που θα περάσουν πολλές σελίδες για να καταλάβει ο αναγνώστης, αφού φροντίζει να δημιουργήσει τον περίγυρό της –τις θείες της, την μητέρα και το σπίτι της-, μέσα από λογής καθημερινά σκηνικά, λογής αναμνήσεις οι οποίες εμφανίζονται από ένα σημείο και μετά προς αγανάκτησή μου. Για πολλές σελίδες δεν γίνεται απολύτως τίποτα στο βιβλίο. Κατά τις οποίες η Ταρτ συνεχίζει και βομβαρδίζει προκλητικά με λεπτομέρειες. Τελικά, ό,τι κι αν ήταν αυτό που ήθελε να πει η Ταρτ έπαψε να έχει σημασία από πολύ νωρίς. Τα προβλήματα που δημιουργεί το μέγεθος του βιβλίου, με την πυκνότητα των περιγραφών και των πλατειασμών, είναι μοιραία. Μέχρι την σελίδα 500, το μόνο ενδιαφέρον πράγμα που έχει συμβεί είναι η παρακολούθηση ενός αλητάμπουρα που αυτή μαζί με τον φίλο της υποπτεύονται για τον θάνατο του αδερφού της (δέκα χρόνια πριν). Εγώ απορώ υπό το βάρος ποιας διάνοιας κατάφερε η Ταρτ να επιβάλλει την έκδοση του βιβλίου της σε αυτήν την μορφή, αποφεύγοντας μια σοβαρή επιμέλεια; Ήταν μόλις το δεύτερό της μυθιστόρημα και φαντάζομαι πως ό,τι επιτυχία κι αν είχε το πρώτο της (Η Μυστική Ιστορία) τούτο εδώ θα τρόμαξε μέχρι και τον πιο καλόπιστο εκδότη με τις χίλιες σελίδες του.Θα σκεφτεί κανείς εύλογα «μα τίποτα δεν είναι καλό σε αυτό το βιβλίο;» Επειδή, πράγματι, μια καταξιωμένη συγγραφέας είναι λογικό να έχει έστω ένα-δυο καλά πράγματα να πει, έστυψα το κεφάλι μου να τα βρω: ίσως, με μπόλικη καλή πίστη, κάποιος να εντοπίσει μέσα στις ατέλειωτες σελίδες του το βιβλίο που θα μπορούσε να είναι αν έπεφτε ένα γερό ψαλίδισμα: μια αφήγηση που μεταφέρει τον αναγνώστη στην προεφηβική ηλικία, με την ματιά εκείνη που μαθαίνει να ερμηνεύει έναν ενήλικο κόσμο αλλά ακόμα χωράει το παραμύθι μέσα του. Χωράει κι η αγανάκτηση για τις αδικίες που μαθαίνουμε αργότερα να καταπίνουμε. Α, ναι. Κάπου στις τελευταίες σελίδες έρχεται και ένα ασαφές επιμύθιο για τους κινδύνους της αυτοδικίας. Αυτά.Ξέρω, όμως, πως υπάρχουν πολλοί που ακόμα και τώρα θα θεωρήσουν αδικία το ένα αστεράκι. Θα σκεφτεί κάνεις πως είναι άδικη αυτή η ολοκληρωτική απόρριψη του βιβλίου, πως αρμόζει μόνο σε ευτελή, κακογραμμένα κείμενα ερασιτεχνικής και ατάλαντης πένας. Εγώ, όμως, ξέρω πως με τον όγκο και την φλυαρία του με γονάτισε, οι αναγνωστικές μου ώρες μαζί του ήταν από τις πιο ανυπόφορες που θυμάμαι, καθώς στην θέα των αμέτρητων σελίδων που με περίμεναν συχνά διάβαζα διαγώνια με μια λύσσα να διασχίσω την θάλασσα από φλυαρίες της Ταρτ. Για αυτήν την παρατυπία στην οποία εξώθησα τον εαυτό μου, εγώ ο τόσο συνεπής αναγνώστης, δεν θα συγχωρήσω την Ταρτ."
41,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1903072-peter-boyle,Rating 3 out of 5,"It's too long. I think that's fair enough to say. But there are several moments in The Little Friend when Donna Tartt reminds us of a what a magnificent writer she really is - when her characters come alive and their deeply-considered thoughts tell us so much about the world we live in.The story begins with a child's murder. Little Robin Cleve Dufresnes is found hanging from a tree in his back yard. Twelve years later we discover the enormous toll it has taken on the family. His devastated mother Charlotte remains heavily medicated, her husband has moved to another city. Robin's sister Alison has developed into a hyper-sensitive teenager who cries at the drop of a hat and would happily sleep all day. Harriet, who was a baby at the time of her brother's death, makes it her mission to identify the culprit. Suspicion falls on one of the Ratliffs, a troubled family from the wrong side of town.Harriet is headstrong and opinionated, but hard to dislike. Though she bosses her best friend Hely around constantly, he is always desperate to impress her. In a sad household she is the only spark of life, forever mischievous and inquisitive. She is also an incorrigible bookworm, favouring tales of Captain Scott and Harry Houdini, whose exploits provide inspiration for her own adventures. But Harriet's curiosity and fearless attitude have a tendency to lead her into trouble.In exquisite, but often aimless prose, Donna Tartt evokes the lazy summer days of a rundown Mississippi town. Like many of its equivalents in the Deep South, its best days are long gone. It is a place of bible camps and trailer parks, populated by greedy car salesmen and pill-popping rednecks. It feels like danger is always close at hand. The finest moments of The Little Friend are not in Harriet's hair-raising escapades on the trail of the killer or in the story's frantic finale. They are in the quiet observations of a family broken by tragedy. An untidy, neglected house where Harriet is left to fend for herself every night as her mother and sister retire to bed before the sun has even set. Where family get-togethers with her great-aunts might begin with joy and laughter, but end in sentimental, embellished tales of dear Robin, and silent tears. So The Little Friend starts out as a mystery, but that's not really what it is at all. It's about how people cope with heartbreak - how some folk become consumed by it and how others refuse to let it define them. We are given a lot of meandering detail about the Cleves and the Ratliffs, and I can't help imagining how the book might have turned out if some of this information had been trimmed. But it would be unfair to focus solely on the story's shortcomings. For at its best, this novel can stand alongside the likes of To Kill a Mockingbird in its examination of lost innocence and childhood friendship."
42,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8161922-f,Rating 3 out of 5,This was far too big a book for this story. Just loads of unnecessary description and background about certain things. It was very slow but i still enjoyed the story. I would read another book by Donna Tartt as I've heard the others are far superior to this. 
43,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23743588-erika,Rating 3 out of 5,"A lot of people are hard on this book, and I agree with most of the criticism. But I still gave it three stars. Tartt’s novel after this one, The Goldfinch, is one of my favorite books of all time, and I think that she needed to write The Little Friend in order to learn how to write The Goldfinch. Both are about kids that suffer a deep loss and never really recover and both are larger-than-life, epic stories. Actually, the connection is even more basic. Both novels are about how people survive, what they do in order to go on, when they are in terrible pain and everyone around them doesn’t understand or even care. Both have brilliantly drawn characters, a profound sense of place, dark humor, and a truly audacious plot. In The Little Friend, Tartt takes her first shot at that concept and misses. The writing is almost laughably overwrought. The ending is unsatisfying. The themes never pay off. There are too many characters and too few answers. Yet I forgave much of it because I could see her writing her path into The Goldfinch.  And when looked at that way, as an exploration of an artist’s development and growing mastery, The Little Friend becomes a much more interesting read."
44,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67746782-gemma,Rating 4 out of 5,"This takes a while to get going. Tartt provides a very detailed account of the home life of her heroine, Harriet and gives lots of background to the town in Mississippi where she grows up. Harriet and her family are traumatised by the violent and mysterious death of her elder brother when the book begins. He’s found hanging from a tree in the garden. No one is prosecuted for his death. So Harriet and her best friend Haly set about solving the crime. Suspicion falls on a redneck family who live in a trailer where they run a drug operation. Tartt gives us a detailed account of these brothers, one of whom is a psychopathic thug, another a born again preacher and another a retarded boy in Harriet’s class at school. I didn’t enjoy it as much as the Goldfinch. The resolution was a bit lame for starters. But Tartt writes so very well and I did enjoy the vivid evocation of life in a disenfranchised town in middle America. "

Maybe it's the type of story - a family saga focused on the apparent suicide of a young boy - but it just didn't speak to me. Well, actually it did as I was listening to the audio version... but there's another issue, the narrator was as bland as the prose. Sleep inducing. Almost literally, actually. I've read some mixed reviews of the book but I know that some readers really liked it and I therefore fear I may have capitulated too soon. Would it have grown on me? No, I don't think so.

Ε, λοιπόν, εγώ το βιβλίο αυτό το κατευχαριστήθηκ��! Δεν ξέρω τι λέτε εσείς, εγώ μια φορά πέρασα εξαιρετικά την ώρα μου, σίγουρα τις έξι μέρες που κράτησε η ανάγνωσή του μου κράτησε πολύ καλή παρέα, και μπορώ να πω ότι τώρα που το τελείωσα (χθες το βράδυ δηλαδή) θα μου λείψει ο μικρόκοσμος του βιβλίου, θα μου λείψουν ορισμένοι χαρακτήρες του και οπωσδήποτε θα μου λείψει η όλη ατμόσφαιρα. Αντικειμενικά, σαν βιβλίο έχει πολλά θεματάκια, όπως για παράδειγμα η ταυτότητά του: Είναι ιστορία μυστηρίου; Είναι κοινωνικό δράμα; Είναι ιστορία ενηλικίωσης; Είναι λίγο all over the place που λένε και στο χωριό μου, έχει λίγο απ' όλα, και σίγουρα η συγγραφέας πολυλογεί εδώ κι εκεί, το τόσο το κάνει τόοοσο, όμως προσωπικά ευχαριστήθηκα και απόλαυσα την κάθε σελίδα, γιατί πολύ απλά μου άρεσε πάρα, μα πάρα πολύ ο τρόπος γραφής της, η ατμόσφαιρα της μικρής πόλης της Πολιτείας του Μισισιπή, αλλά και η μικρή πρωταγωνίστρια, η Χάριετ, την οποία και συμπάθησα παρά τις φανερές ατέλειες που έχει σαν χαρακτήρας. Ναι, πιστεύω ότι σαν βιβλίο δεν είναι καθόλου για όλα τα γούστα, μπορώ να κατανοήσω τόσο αυτούς που το λάτρεψαν (π.χ. η αφεντιά μου) όσο και αυτούς που το έθαψαν ή που το παράτησαν στη μέση (ή και πριν από τη μέση). Προσωπικά, όταν η γραφή μου κάνει κλικ (και εδώ μου έκανε πολύ έντονα κλικ), όταν υπάρχουν έντονες σκηνές και εικόνες, όταν απολαμβάνω την ατμόσφαιρα και τους χαρακτήρες, τότε μπορώ να παραβλέψω τις όποιες ατέλειες στην πλοκή ή την κοσμοπλασία. Άλλωστε, δεν είμαι και κανένα στριμμένο άντερο! Ουσιαστικά το μόνο αρνητικό που βρήκα στο βιβλίο είναι το κάααπως απότομο τέλος, αν και μάλλον όποιο τέλος κι αν είχε το ίδιο απότομο θα μου φαινόταν, γιατί δέθηκα τόσο πολύ με την ιστορία και τους χαρακτήρες, που δεν ήθελα να τελειώσει. Τώρα οι προσδοκίες μου για τα άλλα δυο βιβλία της Ταρτ που με περιμένουν, είναι σαφώς υψηλότερες!"

It was just the sort of book I have been yearning for, one you can't put down and when you do you have to sort of remind yourself to return to the real world and set the characters aside when called away to, you know, work or eat. I read her other book, The Secret History, many years ago and remember liking it enough but I found The Little Friend to be much more at every level.The author's voice is a character in itself. She chooses her words almost surgically and the reader embodies each point of view for each character as she draws us in with memorable archetypal characters and help us to understand them. This compliments a photographic mind for textured detail of the eras covered. I'm glad I waited to write a comment though. Those who have read it will understand what I mean when I say I was hoping for a certain ""reveal"" that was not forthcoming. I wondered at first if it was between the lines and I missed it. Finally, maybe slower than I should have, I could see that the ending is perfect, offering the ultimate in irony and human understanding.Lots of tribute to well-known literature of the South. The main character echoes Scout, and the brilliant short story A Good Man is Hard to Find was called forth more than once in the situations the characters got tangled up in.Highly recomended. A near-perfect contemporary novel, it has it all."

Dare I say that The Little Friend is the best written of all three? The Secret History was a marvelous, magical gut-punch of a novel; The Goldfinch a swirling symphony, a masterpiece. But The Little Friend is a perfectly constructed creation, Donna Tartt's beautiful contribution to the southern gothic genre: it is intimate, dark, with sense of constant movement happening on and off-stage, deeply psychological, with some of the most well written characters I've ever read. The star of the novel, Miss Harriet Cleve Dufresnes, is such a complete human being; I'm going to miss her dearly! The world of the novel is quaint, almost claustrophobic; the inescapable feel of a small, southern town: the gothic shadows, the living heat, the battles between members of various class levels, the tinge of sorrow, ghosts and spirits, snakes, bugs, animal screams in the night, the oppressive childhood boredom, the cacophony of voices serving as the soundtrack to each day, the unavoidable violence and pain....this was all illustrated in stunning detail, and with more economy than Tartt employs in her other two novels. Hopefully we get another in the next 5 years? Fingers crossed..."

Someone please explain.Full Review:The Little Friend is one of those books that pulls the rug out from under your feet- and not in a good way. At least not for me. I had read The Goldfinch and the Secret History first. I love both of those books as if they are my children. No exaggeration, folks. I get all sorts of ragey at any negative comment about either of those books. I had such high hopes for the Little Friend. It came highly recommended by a dear friend of mine. Not to mention that it’s Donna Tartt. I had tried on two previous occassions to read this book. The prologue drew me in and then I got stuck. It isn’t the writing- Tartt is one of the most elequoent writers out there. It wasn’t the characters- they all were fleshed out and vivid. I just can’t really put my finger on what I struggled with. But, I found an audible copy of it and thought maybe just listening to it would do the trick. It did to an extent- I was able to finish it.  I just didn’t care about anyhting in the story. I don’t even know what this book was supposed to be about. You’re led to believe that this book is about a murdered boy. Our main character Harriet’s older brother is found hanged from a tree in their famiy’s front yard on Mother’s Day. A house full of people and yet no one sees a thing. Harriett swears she remembers even though she was only an infant at the time it happened. But one thing is for sure, the family is never the same. So while this is kind of the driving force behind the story, it isn’t at all what the story is about. Sure, Harriett is on a mission to find out who murdered her brother. But that doesn’t mean you’re going to find out. Instead you get a coming-of-age story that reminded me a bit of To Kill a Mockingbird. Only in this story, I didn’t care for the characters, didn’t understand their motives or know why half of them were even there.I still don’t know if it was me or the book. I couldn’t tell you what this book was about or what the point of it was or what message it was trying to tell me. I honestly feel like I was duped. I was led to believe it was about something it wasn’t. And that was a huge disappointment to me. "
51,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48537771,Rating 5 out of 5,"Troubled childhood, crime unpunished, inability to accept the loss of a loved one and the depression it brings, as well as obsessive behaviors shaped in environments that combine all these, are themes that have steadily appeared in Donna Tartt’s novels and have occupied her through time. In terms of pattern, The Little Friend is no different. Harriet Dufresnes, a remarkably intelligent twelve-year-old girl whom indifference and neglection have left their marks on, is obsessively determined to kill the murderer of her brother –who she stubbornly believes to have found despite the fruitless efforts of the police after long years of investigation–, to revenge for her family’s distancing and negligence after Robin’s unsolved homicide. Along with her friend Hely, who would do anything to impress her, they plan to kill Danny Ratliff, a twenty-one-year-old man who they believe murdered her brother eleven years ago. Through her distinct, sensational literary voice Donna Tartt unfolds a story of trauma, social and family injustice, and pursuit of revenge, raising issues such as domestic abuse, poverty, child neglect, depression, criminality, social harassment, and racism. Harriet, although intelligent, remains a little girl who has been hurt and is illustrated with her childish traits of obstinacy and absolution; and Danny, equally unloved and neglected plus both physically and mentally abused by his masterful brother, the head of the family that lives in destitution, is still a boy who had to mature abruptly, who’s frightened and has to resort to crime in order to help his family survive. Through theirs and their families’ points of view, the American South with all its problems and dysfunctionalities is introduced, and we surlily dive into this society of injustice and rot.Another intense and beautifully written contemporary drama is delivered by Donna Tartt’s psychographic literary glance, similar yet wonderfully different from The Secret History and The Goldfinch, albeit gripping and arresting and fascinating nonetheless."

Autorė dievina skaityti, bet, anot jos, rašymas yra dar giliau ir ji dievina tą lėtą kapanojimąsi, lėtą kūrybą, kapstymą ir kūrinio glostymą. Tas jos knygose labai jaučiasi.Emocijų aplitudė kūrinyje itin plati. Kūrinys gana varginantis, nes apimtis nemenka, bet ir pasakojimas, kaip ir būdinga Donnai Tartt, itin detalus. Ką jau ką, bet sukurti kūrinio atmosferą iki menkiausių detalių autorė sugeba meistriškai. Kiekvienoje scenoje atrodo dalyvauji pats: kvapai, jausmai, aplinka - viskas padeda įsijausti. Emociškai skaityti sunku, nes šeimos gyvenimas ties berniuko mirtimi sustoja. Pėdsakus palieka kiekvieno šeimos nario gyvenime ir kiekvienas randą savą išgyvenimo mechanizmą.

Her world overflows with family tragedy, loving and wise great-aunts, embellished family histories, snake handling revival preachers, a mother frozen by grief, the methamphetamine drug culture, a stifling summer church camp, the love of Kipling and Houdini, and a taken-for-granted housekeeper. Harriet also encounters the crazed, paranoid, and hilarious Ratliff brothers (that name!) and their Gum (grandma). Their portrayal is very, very funny, complete with backwoods speech patterns and highly dysfunctional family relationships. It’s an intricate, layered, and perfectly paced universe, beautifully created by Ms. Tartt. A delicious treat that provides great enjoyment and a wonderful escape.

Свърших я много бавно – от една страна, защото по средата на книгата ми се наложи да се захвана с работа, която поглъщаше цялото ми време, но също така защото много често се връщах и препрочитах - красиви изречения, цели абзаци, пасажи, на които не съм обърнала достатъчно внимание, а по-късно се оказват важни. Тази книга говори с гласовете на много герои – различни и по възраст, и по социално положение, и по характер, и при това го прави поразително убедително. Влизаш в главата на наркоман (например) и преживяването е толкова живо, че сякаш ти самият си потопен в неговия изкривен свят. В началото ти е неприятен, а накрая страдаш заради него – а преходът е в резултат на блестащата работа на авторката. Честата смяна на (многоброъните) гледни точки към историята създава усещането за симфоничност. Това е само една от силните страни на романа. Сега нямам време да изредя всичките, но ще спомена прекрасния стил на Дона Тарт, умелото представяне на тази богата, мрачна атмосфера, напрежението, просмукано в текста, ама предадено ненатрапчиво – зарежда те, без дори да усетиш как. Останах леко неудовлетворена единствено от финала – и то не заради това как са се развили нещата, а просто очакванията ми за финал на тази мрачна симфония не отговаряха на делничния заключителен диалог. Но това е наистина незначително на фона на всичко, което открих в тази книга. Тандемът преводач–редактор се е справил блестящо, радвам се, че тази книга е попаднала именно в техните ръце.

Not because I enjoyed it that much, I'm sure no one would, it's basically 800 pages of pure suffering, but because I can't stop thinking about it ever since I finished it 2 weeks ago.Harriet's family never got over the unsolved murder of her big brother Robin, which happened when Harriet was still a baby. Robin was such a happy, pure child, loved by everyone, that his death nearly destroyed the family. While they are trying to move on, it scarred all of them in one way or another. Harriet is so unlike him, that her family never seem to care for whom she really is and neglect her.Nearly twelve years passed since the murder happened and yet Robin is still so present in all of their minds, that Harriet becomes obsessed with the idea of finding his murderer. A search that brings her to Danny Ratliff.Danny is a 21-year-old broken drug addict, who can't escape his toxic family. Growing up living in a trailer park with his many brothers, an abusive father and a grandmother, that is worse than the devil, he never had a chance. Danny lives his life without a real purpose, taking drugs and selling them with his older brother, but not quite ready to give up.When Harriet starts to follow him, it's already heading towards a disaster. Danny is too far gone with all the speed he is taking, so that when he notices her, he is terrified of her and believes that she was sent to destroy him.If you didn't guess it already: this book is fucking devastating.I wasn't joking when I said 800 pages of pure suffering.But even if the suffering doesn't bother you, chances are high that you'll dislike the writing. The Book is mainly narrated by Harriet and Danny, and well... neither of them are especially reliable narrators or seem fit to narrate at all.While Harriet is determined to get revenge for Robin, she is still a child, and she gets distracted a lot. Her narrative matches that. There are a lot of chapters, where she goes swimming, or spends time with others, where neither her brother nor his murderer are even mentioned. Her reason for believing that Danny is the culprit are also childish and not really thought through.Not that Danny's narrative is any better, with all the drugs he has no concept of time and is paranoid as hell.If you are looking for a murder mystery you might also want to consider reading a different book. Robin's murder is really just secondary, the story focuses more on the concerning neglect of Harriet and the abuse that Danny is facing.Neither Harriet nor Danny are likable characters too, but both grow on you despite all the mistakes they are making (there are a lot of them) and you start to get invested in them. Danny isn't the dark hero of this story, isn't the knight in shining armor that comes to save the poor princess, and neither is Harriet the damsel in distress that is waiting for saving. Both of them are reckless, selfish and act irrational.The little girl and the criminal. The bond they share is truly incredible, it's not through friendship or love but pure hatred and fear. Both of them are like magnets, always pushing towards each other. Every time they met, which wasn't often, considering that it's such a long book, I was literally holding my breath.For me the most heartbreaking moment was hearing Harriet say, that Danny is the only person that really looked at her for a long time. She is surrounded by all this people, and yet it's only Danny who really noticed her.Like every other Donna Tartt book, this one is a masterpiece. Yet, I can understand the many negative reviews on it. I was certainly expecting something else too. I wanted to give it 3 stars at first, due to its many flaws, but it's one of these stories that just doesn't let you go after reading it. So all over the place the plot is, it's written incredibly well and the suspense is definetly there in the important parts.It has been a while since a book left me this devastated after I finished it, and I'm sure that both Danny and Harriet will stay with me for a while."
57,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3539985-jill-baber,Rating 5 out of 5,"I would agree that there are two reasons why people seem to like Secret History better than this book.1. The story is not what the description makes it out to be, which can be disappointing. This is not the story of a girl searching for her brother's murderer. It is the story of a 12-year-old girl, her family and friends, and the family of the man who she has decided is her brother's killer over one summer in rural Mississippi. 2. The Secret History has many fans that saw themselves in the austere intellectual characters playing grown-ups at university and found a special enjoyment in the book because that was personally validating. While that is enjoyable, it, in and of itself, does not necessarily make something good literature. Which is too bad, because The Little Friend is extremely good literature. It definitely has different pacing than Tartt's previous work. Where History was a pager-turner, Little Friend is often as slow and meandering as a hot Mississippi summer. This is not always an exciting book to read (though it does have its moments, don't get me wrong), but it is still engrossing. Tartt creates vivid, interesting characters, and writes highly poetic prose. Here, Tartt pairs her substantial writing ability with an intricately constructed plot that addresses race, class, mental illness, loss, and intellectual curiosity to great effect. The Little Friend should not be approached as a follow up to The Secret History, but as its own independent journey. "

Through her obsession and her grief, she tries to revenge his brother who she never knew.By describing the American way of life of these two families in the 70's, the author described the social and moral values of a typical Southern community.Even if this book is a little bit long, one never get tired of the narrative, since the plot is fast-paced all along the whole book.

What I didn't like as much was the fantastical (yet full of realism), violent part of the plot involving a child (near the end), though I still found it all quite readable, especially for the descriptions of the things 'around' the plot: the rendering of feelings and emotions of the unforgettable, delineated characters (whom we really get to know); and the sense of place.I say the above about the plot, yet those fantastical aspects didn't feel completely 'wrong' as I was reading them. Tartt makes them credible -- they develop straight from the characters, as they should. As with The Secret History, Tartt is an expert at suspense and plotting.I felt about this book much as I did about The Secret History (from what I can remember) -- great style and plotting, but maybe still a story that doesn't have much of a purpose (at least, for me) -- though in many ways, this book feels like it has much more 'purpose' than The Secret History did.I give it 4 stars for the parts I loved and for it always having me immersed in the world of the story and its characters, which is also something I love.

This book remains one of my all time favorites. Since it's publication, this is my 5th reading...and I really don't reread books, folks. Harriet is a whip-smart child growing up in the South during the 1960s. Her entire life has revolved around a single event: the murder of her older brother, Robin, which has remained unsolved. Although she was just an infant, Harriet claims to remember the day Robin was murdered, and decides that she (along with her best friend Heley) need to solve the mystery that's over a decade old. Tarrt presents a family and their flaws without apology, but with tenderness. It offers insight on how a family can be shattered by a tragedy, and the different methods of coping used by people after an unspeakable tragedy occurs. Harriet is plucky and resourceful, and her determination to try to ""fix"" her family will have you both cheering and wanting to cry. I can't recommend this book enough. Tarrt's prose, as always, is beautiful. Every single word serves a purpose. I can see why it takes her so long to write a book, because everything is so intricate and thought out. (I've seen reviews that find her ""wordy"" and ""boring"" - everyone is entitled to their own opinion, so no judgement here) but I truly believe that there is so much beauty in her writing style. Go read this. I don't think you'll regret it. "

Прочетох около 600-700 страници и я оставих, тъй като не ми допадна. Две седмици може би след това обаче започнах Малкият приятел, точно преди коледната ни промоция през декември, когато наистина нямам никакво време да чета. Във времето четох по 20-50-100 страници и успях да я преборя.Единственото, което мога да кажа е, че за мен Малкият приятел е въплъщение на думата Роман! Достатъчно сме говорили за Дона и творчеството й, ще избегна сега всякакви сравнения и излишни заключения. Преди всичко се радвам, че Щ. не ме отказа от този роман.""Малкият приятел"" е невероятна книга откъм стил, герои, пресъздаване на емоции, обстановка, психология и навлизане в дълбочина на сюжета. Ще се постарая тези дни да си напиша ревюто, имам няколко отбелязани неща по страниците. Не знам каква е образователната система в Щатите и конкретно как стоят нещата с литературата, но според мен би трябвало тази книга да влезе в списъка със задължителни за изучаване... или поне у нас. Милиарди пъти е по-добра от ""Да убиеш присмехулник"". За мен тази книга заслужава Пулицър откъм идея, реализация и поднасяне. Наистина роман, който след 10 години ще е все така добър, след 20 и след век. Много ми хареса!"

Ясно е, че се радваме на излизането на по-ранния роман на Дона Тарт (2002 г.) заради фурора, който направи окичената с “Пулицър” тухличка “Щиглецът”. Тя превзе доста пространство по рафтовете на библи��теките, както и доста от читателското внимание, до голяма степен заслужено (само заради липсата на суперлативи ще си отнеса боя от няколко луди нейни фенки, но нейсе). Хубаво е, че висока литература излиза все повече у нас, пък на забавяния няма да придиряме – малко ли се радвахме на “Поправките” и “Свобода” на Франзен, а? Та “Малкият приятел” идва при твърде високи очаквания и е нормално да бъде приета по-резервирано – но за мен лично чисто сюжетно тя бе по-интересна от онази с птичката на корицата, пък и размахът не е чак толкова по-малък, и все пак, основно към края, Тарт просто не успя да изпълни високата си заявка. Истината е, че през немалка част от книгата бях убеден, че ми харесва повече от “Щиглецът”, но наистина в края трябваше да приема, че все пак последната книга на Дона е по-добра, при това, подсмърч, с доста.Издателство ""Еднорог""http://knigolandia.info/book-review/m..."

Although I found the writing in this one slightly different, in terms of not being on the same 'wave' I guess as The Goldfinch, which is one of my favourite books of all time. This was a long, slow burn that was at times unnecessarily long and very descriptive, which sometimes I enjoy when it's done well but when it's done a lot, I get tired with after a while. I did like Harriet, she was a likable main character, strong willed and determined and I enjoyed following her on her journey. Overall though I felt like I was always waiting for something extraordinary to happen. There was immense build up and then it just stops and you're left sitting there thinking ""Oh. That's it?"". At the start you think this story is going to center around this one thing stated in the first couple of pages and it does in some way, but I was just left slightly disappointed. A lot of open ends left unanswered in my opinion. In saying all this though, I can't wait to try The Secret History!"
65,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,Rating 3 out of 5,"This book offers both a mystery story and intense character portrayal. I enjoyed tremendously the character portrayal aspect, less so the mystery story. The mystery directs the plot and adds suspense. Harriet, a twelve-year old living in Alexandria, Mississippi, during the 70s, has decided she must solve the mystery of who killed her brother, Robin. He was nine at his death, she only a few months old. All she knows is what she has been told. How reliable is that information? For me there are plot events that are beyond belief, but OK, you are delivered an exciting story. Themes covered include drug racketing, Revival Snake believers and two little kids trying to solve a murder. It is also a coming of age story and about a dysfunctional family. It is with these two themes that the character portrayal comes in. The author is extremely talented in her ability to understand how people behave in particular situations. She understands people....with all our foibles. Not only does she understand but she mirrors this in what her characters say and do. All of the characters, from different walks of life, are wonderfully portrayed. Blacks, whites, non-believers, religious, healthy and ill, the poor and the wealthy, the aged, the young and those half-way through. Dialogs reflect each character perfectly. Common human experiences are captured with words as if through the lens of a camera. It is all of this that I absolutely loved. There is humor. (See below for an example.) I came to care for many of the characters. For me this is an essential ingredient for a successful novel. The characters feel utterly real. None can be seen as totally bad or good. It is for this accurate portrayal of people and daily experiences that I recommend the book. A word of warning. The mystery is not conclusively solved, but it is pretty clear what has happened. What is important is to see how Harriet's need to understand and solve the mystery changes. You watch her growth. Neither is it clear at the novel's end even how the immediate future will unfold. This is not a book for those of you who want conclusive answers either to what has happened or what will happen in Harriet's life. I think this reflects how we all actually live life. How often do we have a clear view of what life holds in store for us, or even what will happen tomorrow? All we can do is figure out what will guide our own behavior.I listened to the audiobook narrated by Karen White. Very well executed. The narration is clear and has a good tempo. I do wish she had paused a bit when the subject totally switches to another time and place and other characters. There are few chapters, so these switches occur within chapters.**********************************I have listened to about half:The text below may give the impression that this is predominantly a cute, sweet story, that it doesn't cover dark themes. I do NOT want to imply this. There are serious psychological and social problems covered within these pages. *********************************I am right at the beginning: Here I go again...when I love a book I am reading I have to tell others. It doesn't matter how this book ends. It is the passage through the book that is so wonderful. Donna Tartt knows people. She has not forgotten how children feel. AND she lets us laugh at those horrible things that happen in all families. This is right at the beginning, so in my view it can't be considered a spoiler I have to show you what this book holds. Don't read this paragraph if you consider this a spoiler, although I don't. Weanie(sp), the cat, is dying. She IS 16.5 years old so what can one do?! Harriet and her sister Alison are at their grandmother's where they usually eat breakfast because their mother doesn't bother to fix anything ....since the death of their brother Robin, and that was 12 years ago! Edie, the grandmother, is at her wits end. Alison has for hours been prone on the floor sobbing. Harriet is reading about brave explorers who had to EAT people who were dying. The point being one MUST be brave, the explorers were brave and look their situation was even worse!(Harriet's answer to problems are to be found in books and logical thinking.) Alison is the one who always cries, but you will understand if you have read from the beginning. Already the personalities are crystal clear. This is the background, but here is what I wanted to tell you. Of course Edie cannot do miracles, so she says she is taking the cat to the vet to have her put to sleep. At this even Harriet starts screaming too. Grandmother leaves. Harriet is so mad she gets a pin and carves in her grandmother's bed ""I hate Edie!"" That isn't enough. She goes to the encyclopedia and cuts out a picture of a baboon and glues that onto a picture of her grandmother in the photo album. Now tell me, isn't this how life really is? And here is what is important: Tartt understand how people behave and she makes us laugh at what is horrible in life. We've all been there; we know what she is saying. You know I don't give a darn usually about fictional mystery stories. Why should I care who killed Robin? He doesn't exist, but I do care. This is clearly a book of character portrayal too. Even if you are doubtful, as I was, you have to give this book a try."

Отваряйки книгата се сблъсках с колоритното семейство Клийв, емоционално опустошено от неописуема трагедия, и там се запознах с малката Хариет , обречена да расте в руините на някогашното великолепие на рода.Хариет, която чува коментари от другите деца и възрастни, че в нейното семейство има нещо ""злокобно"", и които подминава с лека ръка като абсурдни, тъй като организацията им на животът им й се струва „практичен и находчив”. Хариет, която е принудена да расте с депресирана майка и меланхолична сестра, прекалено тихи за буйния й и неспокоен дух, наследен от фелдмаршала и самодържеца на семейството Иди (""градинарят Честър често ги оприличаваше на ястреб и малкото му"") и поради тази причина често намира утеха в компанията на баба си и старите си лели, в книгите или кроейки планове с приятеля си Хийли (представител на спретнато семейство, безобразно разглезен от майка си, предпазван от смъртта и старостта, подозрителен към ""всичките стари лели на Хариет, които с дългите си носове и хитрите си птичи маниери приличаха на сюрия вещици""). И така Хариет си поставя за цел през лятото да открие виновника за смъртта на брат си и да го накаже. И логично, та тя още от малка се интересува от нещата, които вече не съществуват - първо са динозаврите, безследно изчезналите цивилизации, после идва ред на родовата къща ""Трибюлейшън"". И подобно на археолог се впуска в лов на вкаменелости и следи, които да й помогнат да продължи. Впускайки се в това приключение децата се натъкват на престъпниците Ратлиф, отраснали с лишената от всякаква жизнерадост философия на вечната жертва бабичката Гъм за ""простите хорица"". И ще се започне една игра на котка и мишка, където всеки криворазбран поглед ще служи за основата на скелета на огромен зелен динозавър изтъкан от страхове и гузна съвест.Този цитат най- добре приляга на цялостното ми усещане за книгата:""Как тогава да реконструираш този изчезнал колос? Какви вкаменелости бяха останали, какви следи, които да й помогнат да продължи? ... Така че, когато сглобяваше скелета на онова изчезнало чудовище, богатството на рода й, тя не бе разбрала, че част от костите бяха преправени, че други принадлежаха на съвсем различни животни, а третите, най-големите и импозантните, изобщо не бяха кости, а фалшификати от гипс... Хариет съвсем не осъзнаваше, че по време на целия този труд непрекъснато се натъкваше на някои скромни, прашни фрагменти, които, ако си бе направила труда да ги проучи, щяха да й покажат истинския и доста разочароващ ключ към цялата конструкция. Могъщата, грамадна и разкошна "" Трибюлейшън"", която с толкова много усилия бе възстановила в съзнанието си, не бе копие на някога съществувала къща, а химера, басня.""В момента, в който затворих последната страница на ""Малкият приятел"", ме обзе непреодолимото желание да отворя отново първата и да започна цялото това чудо отначало, само и само за да разгледам събитията под друг ъгъл, през призмата на вече известната ми информация и да видя какъв ""скромен, прашен фрагмент"" съм изпуснала.Но няма да направя това точно сега, а ще се ""гмурна в слънчевите плитчини"" на някой роман лишен от дълбоки чувства ""където винаги е топло и светло""."
67,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10223500-karine,Rating 5 out of 5,"A beautiful reflection on grief and the repercussions of a violent act on two families that couldn't be more different from one another: The Cleves, a middle class and matriarchal close-knit group, and the dirt-poor meth-making Ratliffs.  Usually, I don't like children as main characters, but with Donna Tart as a writer, I was more than willing to make an exception and I'm glad I did because this is a masterpiece. Harriet's quest to avenge her brother is dark and menacing, riddled with guilt and failure and most of all loneliness. There is a stark contrast between her troubled mind and the carefree attitude of her best friend Hely, for whom childhood is as it should be, with caring parents. All the surrounding characters, from both families are very well crafted and multilayered; they all have their qualities, their vices and soft spots but my favorite was without a doubt Edie, capable and pragmatic but also cold and starting to feel her body and mind ageing.  The themes are dark and actual, ranging through all societal issues like racism, male chauvinism, unemployment, drug use and of course murder. On this note, don't get wrong footed by other reviews; this book is not about who killed little Robin, it is about all the aftershocks this one act provokes. In that way, it reminder me very often of Reservoir 13 . If you are looking for opulent prose, a young but powerful heroin, with a splendid tapestry of characters on the hot and humid background of 1970's Mississippi, then look no further and dive into the melancholy and wonderful world of little Harriet Cleve Dufresne."
68,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57003346-matthew-ted,Rating 4 out of 5,"33rd book of 2020. This is another brilliant book by Tartt. I guess I'm a big fan now. Her characters are always unbelievably developed, so that they become, well the opposite of unbelievably - wholly believable. I feel as if I know the characters, as I still know (as if personally) the characters from The Secret History. I'm going to be a little Catch-22 now. This book is way longer than it needs to be, but I think by the end it was even too short, somehow. Some parts are completely irrelevant and probably should have been trimmed out, but I enjoyed them. The issue with Tartt is, she's such a brilliant writer. There are a few slips, but it's hardly noticeable when her books are so large. I've given this 4 stars for two reasons. 1. There were times where the plot didn't feel like it was moving, or Tartt was taking us down some side routes, the scenic route, when really I wanted the main route - the motorway. 2. I loved Harriet and Hely, honestly, especially Hely - but they don't compare to The Secret History - when Tartt gives us the mundane scenes like Harriet lying in bed or cutting out magazine pages, or cycling around, I just didn't find it as interesting personally as a load of guys my age drinking and smoking and talking about Greek mythology and love. That's just more my deal. However, this was a great novel, and I'm thoroughly looking forward to The Goldfinch."

70,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/821689-stacey,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is another novel I really enjoyed. I've read criticism that says that since it is set up as a mystery, it was disappointing since the ending really has no resolution. I looked at this book an entirely different way, seeing it as a rich character study of not only Harriet and her sister, mother, grandmother and lively great-aunts, but also of the Ratliff family, who are quite far off from the somewhat wealthy Cleve family. I thought it was quite obvious from the beginning that, as a mystery story, there would not be resolve. I didn't care, since I found the slow, purposeful pacing a wonderful way to set the story in the summer of a 1970s Mississippi town.A huge part of what I liked about this book was the setting. As I said, both the slow pacing and the southern gothic aspect were a huge draw for me. It made it more of a reading ""experience"" rather than just reading. For me, this was truly a book that made me feel like I was transported (how corny) and experiencing something new. I wanted to savor it at times, like a rich dessert to be eaten slowly (I believe that ties in to the reading ""experience"" thing). The descriptions of the heat and the town made me long for hot summer afternoons spent drifting around my old pool at my old house. The setting made up another focal character, and I feel the mood and charm of this story (not to mention the charm of the characters) would have been lost had it been set somewhere other than the south or had been faster paced.Another aspect I really appreciated was the closeness of the extended family. As someone with a very small immediate family (my mother and I) who has always been close with my aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents, great-aunts and the like, I could relate to the fact that the great-aunts were always around and were fully fleshed out and important characters. I also liked the character of Allison, the older sister. She wasn't very active and was mostly background, but she struck me as realistic and someone with whom I could relate. (Is ""with whom"" appropriate there? Would it be ""to whom""? I don't know anything about this ""whom"" business.) Charlotte, the mother of Harriet and Allison (and Robin, obviously),was also portrayed as an annoyingly realistic mother who had never even partially recovered from the loss of her oldest child. I say she was annoying because she neglects the remaining children in a way I found... annoying.I loved this book. It was everything I think a novel of this sort should be. I think the descriptions and character quirks will stay with me for a long time, and in a good way. Since I have a knack for reading author's works out of publishing order, I'll probably go back and soon read her debut novel, A Secret History, which was more popular with her fans and critics."

72,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4012067-stephanie-davies,Rating 5 out of 5,"Donna Tartt’s novel The Little Friend is an excellent example of contemporary American Gothic literature. I absolutely love the character of Harriet, and actually preferred TLF to The Secret History. I realise that most people don't like the ending (or lack thereof) but I thought it was incredible, the way that Tartt underlined the whole message of the text in that last exchange. Not everything needs to be neatly resolved, and I think there are clues throughout the novel for the reader to draw his/her own conclusion.Everything in the novel is somehow tinged darkly by the death of the child in the prologue. Robin’s murder is central to the plot, and he becomes the ghost of the story. In a way, The Little Friend is a Bildungsroman, chronicling Harriet’s too-soon graduation from childhood to the adult world. Her innocence is first corrupted by the foregrounding of her brother’s murder, and then by the acts she both attempts and witnesses.Would definately recommend this one."
73,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/219514-jamie,Rating 3 out of 5,"For two weeks, I breathed and slept this book. I was reminded of Joyce Carol Oates, We were the Mulvaney's--specifically due to character development. I remember being in awe for most of We Were the Mulvaney's--the characters, and there were many, were just...intensely developed. I read a lot, and these characters were the stuff of real life: diverse, with nicknames, private histories and nuances. This novel, in the tradition of Oates, managed the same feat. Carson McCullers is in there, too--with the narrative switching back and forth between the lives of the people you follow.I cannot give a more high reference for character development and local color, which Tartt uses like the Southern Woman writer she is--it's utterly outstanding. I could taste Alexandria and absolutely never grew bored of being there during my two week stay.Sadly, once I got to the end, I realized that's what had kept me going--more so even, than the expectation of plot. It seems, Tartt SO gifted with character analysis and local color (and cross my heat, her first novel is a plot MANIFESTO!), I chugged through all six hundred plus pages of this book without looking back. Marked as a mystery, I did have an expectation for...disclosure. It never came. Instead, it's as if Tartt herself was fooled. I think she was sure the ending, that long-thread she'd been pulling, would finally stop--but it didn't. I almost can't even fault her--it's still SUCH a masterpiece, it is--I loved absolutely every second of it, every auntie, ever little tid-bit no other author would even THINK to include--but I would be lying if I didn't come clean--there is no ending to this book. It's like Tartt got to page 600 and thought, ""hm, shoot, this is long, I need to wrap it up,"" and then forgot she'd started with this involved mystery. Instead she turns her focus to the leading character, and yeah, it's ironic as all get out, but it isn't the ending you want as a reader. You don't feel satisfied in the slightest. I stayed up till nearly four and thought, ""really?""Yet, I'm reluctant to say a word, because, quite frankly, I could never do it. Most writers, even the very most gifted, couldn't do it. Even with no real ending, this book, alone, trumps many of the most fantastically of plot driven novels I've yet to read. I really can't say enough good things about it, except that vital life line of ""end"" is absent. It is Southern Gothic/grotesque. It is a look into cultures most people won't realize existed, it is a stunner character called Harriet, called Allison, called Robin--on and on it goes, but there really is no ending, she just, got to the last page and said, ""I forgot what I was going to say, oh well.""It's disappointing, but still, SO amazing. I could stream-line my self, I could buckle down and write each day and never get close to this--it was a joy to read, but she did over look the fundamental closing. I don't know what happened to Robin. I can analyze and look to all my brain's little cocoons for ideas and potential patterns and ""above me"" tricks, but the reality is, there not there. She just...didn't finish it."

Nelle sue settecento pagine, presenta un immediato riscontro: è lento, vuoto, molto pensato e descritto, con una struttura dilatata e elaborata. Solo nel finale accade qualcosa, quando gli antagonisti, i fratelli delinquenti che trafficano droga, entrano in gioco; la lettura quindi è faticosa, priva di carattere e emozione. Il lettore partecipa con dedizione alla psicologia del mondo femminile traslata in episodi e riflessioni, ma l'entusiasmo è fortemente limitato dal formalismo della rappresentazione. La scrittura è eccellente e la prosa è molto fluida e elegante: la sapienza costruttiva si coniuga con un racconto invece povero e senza audacia che produce noia e che non coinvolge. Harriet è una bambina di dodici anni e la sua vita è stata segnata dalla morte di Robin, suo fratello, trovato impiccato a un albero nel giardino dietro alla casa quando lei era appena nata. Il lutto ha distrutto la famiglia in una tragica assenza, separato i genitori, e Harriet è stata cresciuta dalla nonna: è intelligente, indipendente e ribelle ma molto maldestra, pratica di giochi da maschio e incline a mettersi nei guai. Su questi elementi Tartt rievoca una vicenda non convenzionale con uno stile tradizionale nel quale nulla si incastra e ogni cosa resta sotto la soglia del significativo e nel ripetersi dell'inesistente. Dov'è nascosto il mistero?"

Ült a cro-magnoni csávó a tűznél, és nyomta a rizsát, hogy „És akkor kijött a barlangból az a hatalmas medve, a szeme izzott, a szájából lángcsóvák löveltek, én meg fogtam a vadiúj pattintott hegyű dárdámat, és alulról bele a hasába.” Az alapok már itt is láthatóak: adott egy vagy több szereplő, valamit egy cselekmény, ami tart valahonnan valahová, és motorja a konfliktus. Aztán történt egy és más, a történetmesélők cizellálni kezdtek, egyre komplexebb konstrukciókkal rukkoltak elő, nehogy a hallgatóság az orrát piszkálja unalmában. Mindezt persze akár úgy is felfoghatjuk, hogy előbb az olvasók kezdtek diverzifikálódni, áhítani az egyre csavarosabb meséket, a történetmondók pedig izzadságosan igyekeztek követni őket azon az egyre kanyargósabb ösvényen, ami végül elvezetett Joyce-ig, Nabokovig vagy Esterházyig. No meg Donna Tartt-ig.Tartt az irodalmi evolúció ezen lajtorjáján a nagyepika magasába érkezett el. A nagyepika bizonyos szempontból konvencionális próza: ráérősen halad, ragaszkodik a történethez és igencsak szereplőcentrikus. Emellett hisz abban, hogy a mondat arra való, hogy jelentést közöljenek vele, nem pedig arra, hogy az író megmutassa, milyen elképesztő nyelvi fantáziával áldotta meg a Múzsa. Következésképp igyekszik elegáns és hajlékony maradni, általában kerüli a homályosságot. Mező-, nem pedig mocsárszaga van. A nagyepika legfőbb jellemzője azonban az, hogy a világot akarja újrateremteni*. Kiemelkedő terjedelmét arra használja fel, hogy ne csak a szűken vett történést vetítse elénk, hanem a teljes színpadot, amin az történik – épp ezért van kulcsszerepe benne a szereplőalkotásnak. Mert ha a szereplők nem elevenek, akkor az egész miskulancia nem működik, döcög és kattog, nem leli benne helyét az ember.No most Tartt egészen varázslatos szereplőalkotó. Az utolsó statisztáig meg tudja tölteni élettel a figurákat – külön kiemelhetjük a Négy Gráciát, Harriett nagymamáját és annak testvéreit (a nagymamák testvéreit hogy kell hívni? nagyon nagynénik?), vagy épp Idát, az afroamerikai cselédet. A közeget is gusztusosan ábrázolja: a helyszín Mississippi állam, ahol fülledt a levegő és mérgesek a kígyók, és bár elméletben már régen felszabadultak a rabszolgák, de azért a feketék jobb, ha tudják, hol a helyük**. A történet felütése is erős: meghal egy gyermek, Harriett bátyja, ez pedig az egész családot valami sötét reménytelenségbe taszítja. A cselekmény magva innentől kezdve az, milyen megküzdési stratégiákat alkalmaznak a kötet szereplői egy feldolgozhatatlan trauma után – hát, nem a legjobbakat. Van itt tagadás, van itt sötét depresszió, a legfontosabb szál mindazonáltal Harrietté, aki egy irracionális bosszúdrámát gyurmáz magának a helyzetből, ahol ő hivatott megoldani és megtorolni a bűnt. És tekintve, hogy Harriett gyerek, Tartt pedig nem Kästner, ebből várhatóan nem sok jó sül ki.Különben meg látszik, Tartt-ot mennyire foglalkoztatja a bűn, mégpedig a megbocsáthatatlan bűn kérdése. Hogy miképp jutnak el emberek a rettenetes dolgok elkövetéséig. A Titkos történet gócpontjában is ez állt – ám ott a szerző egy egyszerű, de nagyszerű szerkesztési trükkel pazar fazont adott a regénynek. Itt azért van hiányérzetem. Mintha Tartt nem igazán tudná, mit is akar kezdeni a fő történetszállal, mennyire is akarja jelentőssé tenni. Határozottan esetlegesnek (vagy esetlennek?) tűnnek néha a fordulatok, a cselekmény kacskaringói. Így is remek élmény, mert a felépített világ minden ízében pazar, de valahogy a történet benne sovány, mint egy kóbor kismacska. * A nagyepikai világteremtés nem azonos az atmoszférateremtéssel. Utóbbi a színtér hangulatát tekinti prioritásnak, ami kevés vonással is megragadható. Előbbi viszont nagy hangsúlyt fektet arra, hogy a színteret az olvasó vizualizálni tudja. Mellesleg jegyzem meg, atmoszférateremtésben világszínvonalú magyar íróink vannak - Bodor Ádám például -, de ami a nagyepikát illeti, sokkal szegényebben állunk. Talán Krusovszky nagyregényét tekinthetjük leginkább annak, más nem is jut eszembe.** A cselekmény pontos ideje nehezen megragadható – mindenesetre a polaroid fényképezés már fel van találva."
78,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5068984-tsvetelina,Rating 4 out of 5,"С „Малкият приятел“ Дона Тарт ни повежда на едно измамно, оплетено в съмнения и презумпции пътуване из американския юг на миналия век, пътуване сред малки истини, превърнали се в големи митове, раздути на тъмното истории, придобили размерите на легендарни кошмари… и разобличени на светло тъжни откровения за загубата и мъката, която никога не изчезва, а се изражда в нещо ново, различно, но не по-малко разрушително с времето.Издържан в стила на класицизма и с неподправения талант на Дона Тарт да рисува напоително по страниците с умението да изгражда плътна и почти обсебваща атмосфера, „Малкият приятел“ проследява част от детския жизнения път на Хариет, малката сестра на покойния Робин, намерил смъртта си едва на 9-годишна възраст. Смъртта на Робин завинаги оставя своя белег върху южняшкото семейство и следите от това трагично събитие, вместо да избледняват с течение на времето, зейват все по-дълбоки и грозни. Хариет е запомнящ се и мил на читателя персонаж – едно откровено, будно, смело и безцеремонно, но много чувствително и тъжно момиче, погълнато от идеята за големи приключения – приключенията на героите от книгите, които чете, приключенията, които търси из прашните улици на скучното градче Алекзандрия, където живее, и приключенията, до които биха я отвели тайните на миналото, проблясващи привлекателно досущ като старо злато, заровено в двора на собствено��о й семейство. Хариет, живяла с добре познатите истории за мъртвия си брат, не може да спре да мисли за смъртта му и е решена да открие убиеца на Робин и да го накаже. И, също както южняшките градчета на миналия век неусетно променят историята на случилото се, напудряйки събитията, полирайки до блясък всяка подробност, така че да се запечата добре у паметта на жителите и да остане там като снимка от стар фотоалбум, така и Хариет заедно със своя приятел Хийли бяга от тъжния и самотен свят на реалността и се впуска в едно объркано приключение – приключение, нав��язло дълбоко в суровия свят на порасналите и бързо превърнало се в кошмар, в който самата тя не разбира как се е озовала. Дона Тарт плете мрежа от истории, които пресичат пътищата си, подхвърля оскъдни улики, които оставят читателя с впечатлението, че има за задача да разкрие криминална загадка и неусетно, малко по малко, разказана само привидно без конкретна посока, историята изменя формата и предназначението си, довеждайки същия този унесен читател до момент, в който осъзнава, че за Тарт крайната цел не е важна. Крайната цел вероятно дори не се намира на картата, която е разгърнала пред читателя. Важен е пътят, по който сме крачили редом с нея, важни са спирките, на които сме се задържали за кратко, и границите, които сме пресекли. Онова, което ме впечатли най-много в „Малкият приятел“ бяха тихите застои между избиващото напрежение. Онези моменти, в които осъзнаваш какво отчайващо безредие руши света на подрастващата Хариет, колко самотен, разхвърлян е животът й, колко безконтролно се носи тя из дните на детството си и колко опасно близо до ръба е свикнала да се придвижва, промъквай се встрани от присъствието на възрастните и почти напълно лишена от тяхната трезва и спасителна преценка. Още по-страшно става, когато по детски неумело изразените опити на Хариет да привлече вниманието на майка си са посрещнати от неразбираема липса на досег с реалността, едно странно витаене в пространството между живата реалност, обитавана от живите й деца, и сънната реалност на спомените, в която живее мъртвият й син. Тази безпомощност да си дете, която Либи съчувствено бе прозряла у Хариет, тази неспособност да промениш света, който те заобикаля и затиска, се просмуква скръбно измежду редовете и не пуска до самия край.Друга нишка от историята на Тарт, която намирам за изключително изкусно изградена, е светът на семейство Ратлиф. На моменти на читателя може и да му се сторят хиперболизирани тези образи с крайностите, чрез които са изградени характерите им, но в крайна сметка именно на фона на тези крайности успя да ме потресе несправедливостта, мощната ударна вълна на живота, повалила ги по силата на една предопределеност, едно изначално отсъждане къде и в какво семейство си роден, къде си отгледан и с какви битови сблъсъци си израснал. Каква трескавост имаше в борбата на тези Тартови герои, каква непримиримост и в същото време с каква съкрушителна предвидимост бе начертана съдбата им!След последната страница на „Малкият приятел“ се почувствах сякаш излизам от дълго сънуван сън. Имаше причина да искам да прочета този роман на Тарт сега, докато е още горещо, някак инстинктивно търсех духа на южняшкото лято и съвсем очаквано, не останах разочарована от атмосферата, която в пълен синхрон с вътрешния свят на героите и наравно със сюжета изгражда целия роман. Няма значение кой е убиецът в тази история. Важно е преплитането на връзките в нея, пътищата, по които тръгват героите на Тарт, къде се пресичат и накъде отвеждат. Впечатлена съм от този роман - много, много ми хареса. Ако не бях чела другите книги на Дона Тарт, вероятно щях да лепна едни категорични пет звезди, защото, реално погледнато, на фона на други книги, които съм оценила с 4 звезди, „Малкият приятел“ си тежи на мястото повече от тях. Обаче съм чела вече и „Щиглецът“, и „Тайната история“, които оставиха в съзнанието ми по-дълбока следа, въздействаха ми помитащо като наркотик и макар че имахме „удоволствието“ да се нагледаме не на един или два ефекта от употребата на метамфетамини, „Малкият приятел“ не успя да ме упои по онзи поглъщащ начин, не успя да ме накара да забравя какво е сън и не ме обсеби, както направиха Тио, Ричард и Хенри досега. И въпреки че няма значение кой е убиецът, е от голямо значение изборът на Тарт така и да не разберем еднозначно кой е той. И това страшно много ми харесва! Намирам това решение на Тарт като поредното доказателство колко много е държала този роман да бъде коренно различен от предходния й – „Тайната история“, в която първо разбираме кой е мъртъв и кой е отговорен за тази смърт, и в която на фокус е привилегированата класа за разлика от нравствената и класова беднотия и упадък, лъхащи от „Малкият приятел“. Ако с ""Тайната история"" Тарт разказва история какво се крие зад една смърт и как се е стигнало до нея, то в ""Малкият приятел"" тя изследва последиците напред във времето след смъртта.Освен това, именно защото не знаем кой е убил Робин, ми се струва, че Тарт може би намеква едно от двете неща: или че убийството не е било наистина убийство (макар че аз самата имам няколко подозрения, но те продължават да се надмогват едно друго и от цялото мислене излиза просто една неизменна главоблъсканица), или че има по-важни неща от самоличността на убиеца, а сред тях – опасността от лековерието, измамната същина на всичко, което ни заобикаля и колко всеобхватно може да бъде въздействието на миналото, когато настоящото е осеяно с пукнатини, които никой не се грижи да запълни.

81,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5067228-marianne,Rating 5 out of 5,"“It was the last picture they had of him. Out of focus. Flat expanse of green cut at a slight diagonal, with a white rail and the heaving gloss of a gardenia bush sharp in the foreground at the edge of the porch. Murky, storm-damp sky, shifting liquescence of indigo and slate, boiling clouds rayed with spokes of light. In the corner of the frame a blurred shadow of Robin, his back to the viewer, ran out across the hazy lawn to meet his death, which stood waiting for him – almost visible – in the dark place beneath the tupelo tree”The Little Friend is the second novel by American author, Donna Tartt. Harriet Cleve Dufresnes is twelve. Her best friend, (Duncan) Hely Hull is eleven. It is the summer of 1976, Alexandria, Mississippi, and they have managed to avoid being sent to camp. Having exhausted their usual activities, Harriet becomes interested in the murder of her brother Robin, who at age nine was found hanging from the black tupelo tree on Mother’s Day, twelve years earlier. It’s something nobody talks about.Tartt expertly captures feel of a never-ending Mississippi summer during vacation time. Her portrayal of twelve-year old Harriet beautifully illustrates the naivete and the single-minded self-absorption of youth which, coupled with the allure of a taboo topic, facilitates a fixation borne of an absolute conviction based on hearsay. Tartt brings together in one tale the genteel class who still have black servants and the residents of the seedier side of town, the poor “White Trash”. The poverty mindset is well depicted, as is that of the more fortunate classes:“She possessed, to a singular and uncomfortable degree, the narrowness of vision which enabled all the Cleves to forget what they didn’t want to remember, and to exaggerate or otherwise alter what they couldn’t forget; and in restringing the skeleton of the extinct monstrosity which had been her family’s fortune, she was unaware that some of the bones had been tampered with; that others belonged to different animals entirely; that a great many of the more massive and spectacular bones were not bones at all, but plaster-of-paris forgeries”At over five hundred pages, this is no fast-paced murder mystery, but rather, a slow burn Southern drama, in which the tension builds to an exciting climax. This novel is filled with some deliciously black humour and a good dose of irony as characters navigate their war through meth labs and drug-fuelled paranoia, snakes and preachers, summer camp and funeral parlours, trailers and decaying elegance, grief and guilt. Tartt treats the reader to some marvellous descriptive prose: “The view had captivated her: washing fluttering on lines, peaked roofs like a field of origami arks, roofs red and green and black and silver, roofs of shingle and copper and tar and tin, spread out below them in the airy, dreamy distance. It was like seeing into another country. The vista had a whimsical, toy quality which reminded her of pictures she’d seen of the Orient - of China, of Japan” and “This isn’t real, he told himself, not real, no it’s just a dream, and indeed, for many years to come – well into adulthood – his dreams would drop him back sharply into this malodorous dark, among the hissing treasure-chests of nightmare” are examples. A brilliant read."
82,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5837456-susan,Rating 4 out of 5,"Published in 2002, this is Donna Tartt’s second novel and the difficult follow up to, “The Secret History.” I read this when it first came out, but this is the first time I have revisited it since then. On my first read, I recall finding the ending a little confusing, so was interested to see what I thought of it this time round. If you like plot driven books, then Donna Tartt is not for you. She has admitted in interviews she likes to take her time writing her novels and spending time with her characters. She creates a world, which her characters inhabit and then invites the reader to also take time getting to know them. Her novels meander, the story unravels slowly. The author mentions something, or someone, then comes back to it. I like the way she, rightly, expects the reader to keep track. I like the slow unfolding of her stories…Harriet Cleve Dufresnes is a baby in 1964, when she is on the porch with her four-year-old sister Alison, and her brother Robin, who is nine, is found hanging from a tree on the day of a family dinner. This tragedy overshadows her childhood and her family – her mother, Charlotte, descends into a drug induced haze, father Dix moves to Nashville, claiming it is for work, and Harriet, and Alison, come to rely on housekeeper, Ida Rhew, Grandmother Edie and Great Aunts Tat, Libby and Adelaide. This novel takes place in Mississippi in the 1970’s and the reader is quickly aware this is a place of racial, social and class division. People ‘know their place,’ but are not always happy about it. Harriet is twelve when we get to know her – this angry, fearless, aggressive young girl. Harriet is a voracious reader, who haunts the library, is the leader of her friends – especially the adoring Hely and is obsessed with the death of Robin. In a way, Harriet’s outsider status is determined by her age. She yearns for answers but relies mostly on what she overhears. She loves her Grandmother, her Great Aunts and Ida, but her mother’s benign neglect and Alison’s drifting, uninterested behaviour, leaves her with a lot of time on her hands and the ability to investigate her belief that Robin was killed. Harriet’s attention focuses on the local ne’er do well Ratcliff family – in particular, Danny Ratcliff – with tragic consequences.So, you will remember that I mentioned if you enjoy fast moving, plot driven books, then this will not be for you. Likewise, if you like a novel which ties up every end, the answer is much the same. Donna Tartt writes beautifully, her prose is brilliant, her characters believable – even the larger than life cast in this novel – and you will come to care about what happens to them. However, if you like a crisp finale, with everything neat and clean, then this is not for you. Life is not like that and so not of Harriet’s, or the readers, questions will be answered. The point of Tartt’s novels is the journey and I enjoy travelling with her and found this novel utterly compelling, as Harriet faces change and uncomfortable truths and the reader revels in the evocative setting."
83,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64075211-ellie,No Rating,"hello my name is ellie and I’m a donna tartt stan but I’m really not sure about this one.frankly, I’m finding it very hard to rate (probably about a 3.5?) but of all of Tartt’s books, this one is my least favourite. It was excellent in some parts, exceedingly slow in others. I skipped entire portions but did read others sections attentively. The thing is, THE LITTLE FRIEND deviates quite a lot from the initial whodunnit premise. At first it’s all about who killed this boy Robin, then it morphs into a tale about a different dysfunctional family and drugs. It is, essentially, a Donna Tartt book with incandescent writing and similar motifs to her other books - there are similarities here and there with the first half of THE GOLDFINCH given the age of the narrators, drugs and desolate setting - but it feels different too. If I didn’t know the author, I might not have thought it was a Donna Tartt novel/I might have given up on it. The ending is very open, and your reception of it does depend on the kind of reader you are and what you’ve felt you’ve learnt from the book as a whole. For some, it carries a subversive message along the lines of ‘sometimes we will never know the answers’ (and undoubtedly this is Tartt’s intention) but for others it’ll be a total cop out - what’s a murder mystery if you never find out the killer?If you want to read Donna Tartt, start with one of her other books. This book has a case of the sophomore slump."

So many bad reviews set my expectations low, but honestly, I really loved this. Like I loved it so much I couldn't stop thinking about it for a week after. Too many people who read this book probably shouldn't have read it because it definitely is not for everyone (there's many long descriptions and no satisfying ending - and this is not a murder mystery. I can see why some people were tricked into believing that).Despite this book's intimidating length, I thought it was completely gorgeous. I absolutely love Harriet as a main character. She might be my favorite Tartt protagonist as of right now. She's so relatable and unapologetically herself. It's sad how she didn't have a single adult in her life to really understand her or recognize and encourage her intelligence.The writing is so rich and vivid, and the setting and the rest of the characters were very compelling as well. Donna floors me every single time. I will never not be in awe of this woman and everything she writes."

И някак винаги за дългите книги пиша повече, защото всеки детайл остава личен. „Малкият приятел“ е една умна книга, която с много думи разказва за малко неща, но го прави толкова добре, че ти се иска това да е една приказка без край. Кошмар и мистерия, които поглъщат, притеглят и добавят един допълнителен ескиз на писателя Дона Тарт. На личността Тарт.

This 550-page book could easily have been condensed to 250 at the most, and even then, it would have been nice to see some character development and/or some sort of resolution to the central conflicts presented. I should have checked the Amazon reviews before slogging through this overwritten saga; it's never a good sign for a book to have twice as many 1-2 star reviews as 5 star reviews.

95,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5204784-vonia,Rating 2 out of 5,"Following Donna Tartt's other great novels, ""The Little Friend"" was an all around disappointment. It is her sophomore work, following the highly successful ""The Secret History"". Following, as in ten years later. Another tome, at more than 500 pages, I expected more.""After The Secret History I wanted to write a different kind of book on every single level. The new book is symphonic, like War And Peace,"" Tartt ambitiously answers in an interview with The Guardian. She reiterates throughout the interview that what drives her novel writing is purely technical, a labour for new writerly challenges, rather than particular concerns or fascinations, such as the return to the south of her childhood, or a search for truth.This explains a little why the plot was uninteresting, disconnected, and quite broad. It covers themes of race, growing up in the south in the early 1970s (Alexandria, Mississippi), the dynamics between the maids/bordering on slaves and the protagonist Harriet Cleve Dufresnes' family. It is part adventure, part mystery, as she spends the summer trying to track down the murderer responsible for the unexplained death of her brother Robin, who was killed by hanging in 1964 at the age of nine. Based on something Ida Rhew (the family maid) said regarding the two young boys fighting, she is convinced that a particular young man, Daniel, is this murderer. Daniel is ""The Little Friend"". The cover art, interestingly, refers to a toy Edie (Harriet's grandmother) remembers her sister playing with. How this has enough importance to be featured the cover, I have no idea. Other editions feature snakes, which makes a little more sense, although still nowhere near a central focus of the novel. (One of the many adventures Harriet has during her revenge quest has her releasing a room full of snakes and subsequently trying to poison him via throwing one into Daniel's TransAm.)Daniel has his own problems. He has three brothers, all in the drug business, all but young Curtis having served time. He actually feels guilty about his friend Robin's death; blaming himself for leaving him alone that fateful afternoon. There are parts of the novel told from his point of view, his dealing with trying to better himself, while getting high, while struggling with his dangerous brothers and mother playing favoritism with Farish, his older brother, who is also the most dangerous and of course holds the key to his future, a heroin stash hidden in the town's water tower.Another theme central to the novel is family dynamics. Daniel's family is contrasted with that of Harriet's, which can also compared to that of her friend Hely's. They are all ""complicated"" and certainly not the traditional. In fact, it brings to mind Tolstoy's ""All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."" Hely and his older brother Pemberton do their dammed best to eliminate each maid/nanny that comes their way, being outright rude, vindictive, and completely blind to their feelings. Their mother pampers them and succumbs to their whims, much to the chagrin of their father, the school principal. (Apparently she let Pemberton eat nothing but chocolate cake for a few years, ending with him refusing dinner at a birthday party, demanding chocolate cake only.)This is contrasted with my favorite part of the novel, the exploration of Harriet's relationship with her maid Ida Rhew. Ida is paid $20 a week.Harriet and her more timid sister Allison both love Ida. Understandably, when their mother has checked out ever since Robin died. But, the culture teaches them that they are better than Ida; above her. Unaware of the harm being caused, they censor their show of love. The regret will come later. ""For the rest of her life, Harriet would remember with a wince that she had not been brave enough to stay for one last afternoon, to sit with Ida with her head on ida;s knees. What might they have discussed? She would never know. It would pain her that she had not told her goodbye... it would pain her that she had been too proud to tell Ida that she loved her... A whole new kind of life was settling about Harriet, there in the dark hallway; and though it felt new to her then, it would become familiar in the weeks ahead."" Other parts of the story are from the point of view of Edie. She is vivacious and outspoken like Harriet. She practically raised the two girls, their mother having no interest nor capacity mentally in her grief over Robin, and their father having even less, preferring to live in another state and visiting once a year, causing nothing but pain and violence on those occasions. I hated Edie for her disrespect of the maids. Aside from Ida, whom Charlotte, Harriet's mother, ungratefuly terminated because she wanted more than $20 a week, there is Odean, maid and companion to Libby, Edie's Sister and Harriet's Great Aunt. For decades, she was Libby's most loyal companion; they were best friends. Despite knowing this, Edie did not even contact her when Libby died. And shows barely any regret for it. I feel for Ida and Odean. Allison, at least, is brave enough to show her love, crying and hugging, on both occasions. Harriet, unfortunately, is more reserved. The ending of the novel was annoying me. The ""oh she died, never mind only kidding, oh he died, only kidding"" thing. The first time, it might be a twist. The second time for the same thing except with another character? No, cheapens story for me. The climax of the novel has Daniel in a sort of showdown with Harriet there. He kills Farish, prepared to retrieve his ticket to success, only to find young Harriet having thrown the drugs into the water, not knowing what it was exactly she has done. Knowing only that she wants her revenge, she tries to kill him, only to have the gun recoil on her. Daniel drowns her. Or so he thinks. Harriet escapes in a struggle and watches him drown. Or so she thinks. In the hospital she finds out he survived, hanging on a ladder rung for two days. Most importantly, the story begins with Robin's death. It is supposedly the focus. That is a lie. It keeps circling it, going back, drifting away, drifting far, far away, then ending there. We learn the details and circumstances surrounding his mysterious death in the opening pages. 500 pages later, we know practically nothing new. Then the last page is turned. Nothing. It is not addressed, either. Rather, it seems like Tartt forgot all about it. Tartt calls it ""a frightening, scary book about children coming into contact with the world of adults in a frightening way."" I can agree with that. Over all, a good book. But much too long, drawn out, and lacking focus. There was to much going on at once. But the ""Harriet the Spy"" reference redeems it quite a lot."
96,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5115004-makenzie,Rating 3 out of 5,"I have so many conflicting thoughts on this. On the general sentence level, there is no writer like Donna Tartt. Her prose is exceptional and the prologue of this book could really stand on its own as an exceptional piece of literature. But the amount of detail is sometimes excessive and the pace of the book becomes frustrating at times. Also, this book is definitely from a white perspective, so there is racial issues that sat a bit uncomfortably with me in how they are presented. That's not a criticism of Tartt and I'm not trying to suggest that she is endorsing any of the views expressed by her characters - the language used is of course meant to reflect on the casual racism of the characters and the reality of a racial divide in a town in Mississippi, but it's also not something that's necessarily easy to reconcile. Atmospherically, this book is claustrophobic, dark, strange, and uneasy. It is also a difficult world to leave once finished, and I think it will retain its grip on me for quite some time."

Nie chodzi o podobieństwa fabularne - tych nie ma zbyt wiele. Chodzi o nastrój, sposób prowadzenia narracji. O miejsce - południe Stanów Zjednoczonych i ciągle obecny nastrój rasizmu. A nawet o główną bohaterkę. Ale to nie jest ""Zabić Drozda"". To jest po każdym względem słabe; nudne, niekonsekwentne, źle napisane. Nie lubię języka tej książki. Wydaje mi się niewiarygodny. To oczywiście może być kwestia tłumaczenia. Ale generalnie chodzi to, że ma się wrażenie, że autorka próbuje wczuć się w środowiska, których nie zna. Dzieci nie mówią, jak dzieci. Bandyci nie mówią jak bandyci. Wszyscy mówią tak samo. No i do tego bezsensowne zakończenie. Nie zamyka żadnego z rozpoczętych wątków. Ale to nie jest otwarte zakończenie dobrej książki, po której od przemyśleń i przeżyć czytelnika zależy, jak zamknie niezakończone wątki. To po prostu pozostawia niedosyt i frustrujące wrażenie, że się człowiek męczył tydzień a na koniec nie wie o co chodziło. P.S. Poza tym to wydanie ma potwornie dużo prostych literówek, co jeszcze bardziej zmniejszyło przyjemność z czytania."

102,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/160654544-vl-du-mihail,Rating 5 out of 5,"Cred că una dintre cele mai mari nedreptăți de care au parte mulți dintre autorii care devin faimoși și apreciați încă de la debut e să nu le fie apreciate atât de mult celelalte opere. Acest lucru l-am simțit pe tot parcursul lecturii Micului prieten, splendoarea Donnei Tartt care, în ciuda celor 855 de pagini, m-a ținut într-o tensiune continuă, spre deosebire de Istoria secretă care m-a plictisit groaznic.Deși pretextul romanului e rezolvarea unui caz de crimă, miza adevărată a cărții nu e asta. Rezolvarea cazului ține de dorința intrigantă a unei fete deosebit de inteligente, o mică Madame Bovary care nu respiră romantismul bolnăvicios și idilic, ci o pasiune înfocată pentru aventură, mizând întotdeauna pe propria istețime.Nu voi face un rezumat al cărții pentru că pot fi foarte ușor găsite tot felul de rezumate pe internet, mai importante cred că sunt emoția și elanul de a schimba paginile pentru a urmări aventurile lui Harriet, ale bunicii și mătușilor sale, ale prietenului ei Helly și ale unei familii de albi aflate la periferia straturilor sociale pe care Donna Tartt o explorează cu măiestrie prin intermediul lui Harriet.Stilul Donnei Tartt îi este caracteristic, descrieri lungi, amănunțite, care pot da senzația de ritm monoton, însă doar de foarte puține ori am simțit că exagerează. Într-adevăr, uneori vrea să devină prea poetică, iar poeticitatea asta inserată în proză în unele cazuri blochează ritmul și muzicalitatea, dar de cele mai multe ori am rămas fascinat de construirea frazelor. Unul dintre episoadele mele preferate se întâmplă pe la jumătatea cărții când Donna Tartt o ia, îndrăznesc să cred, pe urmele lui Homer și suspendă acțiunea în maximul ei punct culminant, pentru a insera un flashback de vreo două pagini și apoi revine la momentul pe care îl părăsise (amintindu-mi de scena în care Eurycleia îl recunoaște pe odiseu după o cicatrice și in urmatoarele doua pagini aflam toată istoria acelei cicatrici, când de fapt noi murim de nerăbdare să aflăm dacă slujnica îi va descoperi sau nu pe Odiseu celorlalți). De asemenea, Donna Tartt știe cum să se joace cu suspiciunile cititorului, îți întinde o capcană și te duce pe o pistă greștită la finalul căreia poți totuși respira ușurat.Un alt lucru la care m-am tot gândit e cât de important este pentru un copil, adolescent, să aibă modele. Departe de mine gândul de a începe un discurs în care să mă plâng de influența vloggerilor și a influencerilor asupra copiilor din zilele noastre, însă modelul pe care Harriet îl consideră drept de urmat mi-a tras totuși un semnal de alarmă. Fascinată de povestea unui înotător care a reușit să-și țină respirația sub apă timp de 3 minute, Harriet exersează și tot exersează să-și țină respirația tot mai mult, să ajungă la recordul înotătorului, iar această practică se dovedește a fi vitală pentru că îi salvează și viața. Atunci nu exista internet, iar modelele ți le luai fie din realitatea ta imediată, fie din cărți, articole etc - dacă pentru copii era un lucru mai bun sau mai rău, fiecare e liber să reflecteze.Anton Cehov spunea ceva de genul că dacă într-o poveste apare o pușcă și până la final nu se trage cu ea, acea poveste și-a ratat scopul/relevanța. Harriet se joacă cu puștile și pistoalele de vânătoare ale tatălui său, dar dacă Donna Tartt respectă principiul lui Cehov, va las pe voi sa aflati. Micul Prieten este un roman căruia i-am acordat 5⭐️ și chiar îl recomand din toată inima"

104,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35942740-obsidian,Rating 1 out of 5,"This book is not worth reading. If you are considering it, just know that after reading 640 pages, you still don't find out who murdered Robin Cleve Dufresnes. You are stuck jumping around to a myriad of characters with no real ending in sight. When you do get to the end you are going to want to throw this book across the room and ask was that it? There is no character development. The flow is non-existent. We jump back and forth among different times in this book and between characters so it's really hard to even recall who is who and who did what to who after a while. ""The Little Friend"" is supposed to be about the aftermath of the Cleve family trying to put themselves back together after Robin Cleve Dufresnes is found murdered in the front yard. The book starts off on his last day and we get to see why so many in the family loved Robin. When he is found murdered, there is an initial investigation that turned up no suspects. The death left Robin's mother, Charlotte, devastated and the woman for all intents has turned into a living ghost. Robin's father, Dixon, who didn't really care about his family at all prior to Robin's death, disappears to another state entirely and only returns home for the holidays. It really is Charlotte's mother and her aunts that take over raising her two daughters, Alison and Harriet. After the prologue we get into the here and now and find out that Alison is 16 and Harriet is 12. If you have to call someone the main character of the book, it would be Robin's younger sister Harriet. Harriet decides that she is going to solve the mystery of who killed her brother. When her family's maid, Ida Rhew talks about how Robin was always fighting with a local boy named Daniel Ratliff. Ida and others have looked down their noses at the Ratliff family and there are hints that he was jealous of Robin. Harriet through no evidence at all decides that Daniel murdered her brother so she is going to kill him. No this makes zero sense and since Harriet barely seems to like anyone in this book, it's odd she decided she is going to avenge her brother who has been dead for 12 years. Harriet is annoying. Tartt shows her nastiness throughout this book. And then something changes and we are supposed to feel for her when the family's maid quits. Eventually this turns into a coming of age story for Harriet, but then we go back to the ridiculous subplot with her trying to kill Daniel. Tartt does foreshadow that Harriet's life gets worse after this summer and she can pinpoint the exact time when things started to go badly for her. Her side kick in arms to this mess is a boy named Hely. Hely sucks and is focused on either making Harriet take notice of him and or annoying her throughout this book. Hely agrees to help Harriet with the killing of Daniel because he has zero sense too.Besides following Harriet and her misadventures, we also follow Harriet's grandmother, Edie, and the aunts, Libby, Adelaide, and Tat. The book jumps around between them and also Daniel and his family too. If this has just been a book focused on a southern family in the 1970s it maybe would have worked, instead we have the murder mystery plot with a hundred other things going on. The book setting is the 1970s in Alexandria, Mississippi. There is some instances where I thought I was reading ""The Help"" when we get into the dynamics of white children and their black maids. Harriet doesn't seem to pay any attention to her family's maid, until through a series of misunderstandings, Harriet causes Ida Rhew to get dismissed. Her great aunts don't really get why she's upset, except for one, and Harriet refuses to say goodbye to Ida Rhew and we find out regrets it for the rest of her life.The ending was just a mess. Things happen. There are red herrings. And then the book clunks to a close. "

Малкият приятел ми хареса. И то доста. Но няма как да ѝ дам повече звездички, не заради друго, ами защото в сравнение с Щиглецът, тази книга не ме потресе толкова. Не ми разкърти устоите на света, в който живея :) А именно това очаквам от Тарт. Звездичките за малко да ги направя три, но това би било обидно. Три са като за Тарт, но не и в сравнение с други книги, на които давам толкова. И все пак исках повече от тази история. Героите са толкова невероятно измислени и построени, че според мен те заслужаваха по-добра история. Още по-добра. Рядко в книга обичам повече героите, отколкото самата история. Но Хариет просто ми е един от любимите хора, наистина. За мен тя е другар :) (Друг, толкова любим герой, ми е Ричард Кац от Свобода на Франзен). Искам Хариет да е моя или поне да я познавам. Харесвам този тъжен, самотен, малък, ужасно умен и буден, самодостатъчен човек, който обича книгите. (Не знам защо ми хрумна, че самата Дона Тарт е била такава като малка). Искам да чета повече за нея и за живота ѝ. Хрумна ми, че би било чудесно, ако тази книга има продължение, или просто Тарт да напише друга история пак с главен герой Хариет, като по-голяма, може би. Разбира се, това няма да се случи, но все пак не пречи да си мечтая. И другите герои от Малкият приятел са много истински и живи. Малкият Хийли, който неведнъж исках да пребия. Чудесни образи са и нещастните братя Ратлиф, страхотните баби и лели - тази фурия Иди. Интересната сестра на Хариет Алисън (която, според мен трябваше да има по-ключова и значима роля в историята). В Малкият приятел ми липсваше и онази силна, неподправена и първична емоционалност, която имаше при Щиглецът. Тук беше засегната на моменти, но после сякаш избледняваше за сметка на описания, които ми бяха излишни. Финалът не ме потресе. Бях сигурна, че няма да се разбере кой е убиецът на Робин, още от самото начало. Не ме потресе, но ми хареса с достоверността си. Това уважавам. И за мен малкият приятел си е точно Дани Ратлиф (сякаш бях чела в ревюта, че има колебания у други читатели). Но в Малкият приятел ми липсваха силните думи и изречения, които направо ми образуваха сърдечни спазми като последните страници на Щиглецът. Помните ли онова чудо, финалът като есе за живота?Накратко, да, исках повече от Малкият приятел. Повече краткост в историите със змиите и повече истории с другите герои, повече емоции.Още по-накратко: искам още много Дона Тарт книги."

I thought I'd reacquaint myself with Ms. Tartt's works (all...ahem...two of them) to see if I'd share the NPR reviewer's anticipation. After re-reading The Little Friend, a sort of Old South-meets-New-Skeezy-South-Coming-Of-Age-Murder-Mystery, I'd have to say, i'm not exactly champing at the bit to read Ms. Tartt's new book.Buried in the languorous, way over-descriptive and meandering prose there's a whiff of a decent story to be told: Harriet Cleve Dufresnes, a kid growing up in the (presumably) late 1970s in Alexandria, Mississippi, has her life irreparably turned upside down when her brother Robin is brutally murdered. Her ambition: to solve his murder and exact revenge on the perpetrator(s). Young Harriet is a descendant of Old Antebellum moneyed Mississippi; her attention for the murder falls on the have-not white trash Ratliff family from the other side of the tracks, resulting in a kinda The Help meets Breaking Bad by way of Encyclopedia Brown (if not Britannica). It's a heady stew. Ordinarily I really like when authors try to paint a complete picture, but Ms. Tartt's efforts come off, more often than not, as idle noodling at the keyboard, almost like she was battling writers block the whole way through writing it. Occasionally a sentence will sparkle with clarity, but the effort is drowned by paragraph after paragraph of fluff that looks pretty, but does little to advance the story. There is no reason at all to take two pages describing Harriet's solo jacks game (breaking down the composition of the superball, or including a an exacting portrait of the Chinaman's hat-shaped floor nail the ball caroms off of, for instance), no reason to expand an otherwise satisfying plot climax into tantric, 60-page length, no reason to take a straightforward story and bloat it to an epic 640 page tome. I'll probably have to re-visit The Secret History, which I remember liking a lot when it came out 20 years ago, to see if it will whet my appetite for Ms. Tartt's upcoming release. I'm not holding my breath though. "

A little boy is murdered, his mother, sisters, and aunts cope with the tragedy in various ways, his younger sister takes it upon herself to try to solve the crime, and everyone sort of moseys along towards a vague ending. That said, it was a real kick to read anyway. The book itself was thick with teeny type. It took me days & days to get through it because I dipped in & out, moseying along myself among maiden aunts, precocious sleuthing youths, negligent mothers, and oh so many Gothic renderings of Mississippi flora & fauna, properly-named mansions, and meth-addled menaces. Though the end does not really gratify, the pleasure was in the humid, unsettling journey of the whole thing. Although it is annoying that you never find out who committed the murder that the darn book is based onAlso, while Donna Tartt may not have been able to make me swoon with this one, she did unearth my heretofore unknown terror of snakes. As I was reading the bit where Harriet & Hely search the subdivison for cottonmouths & copperheads, I stretched my arm out along the back of the couch. Wind blew, the curtain brushed against my hand in a distinctly snakey way, and I kid you not, I screamed.2022 rereading review: Continuing to take the 'reread 600+ page books in a two or three days instead of reading any of the new books on my to-read pile' challenge. I LOVED this one the second time around, and concur with a review near the top of the (eyesore) book page: this is not a mystery and it doesn't have anything to do with Robin at all really, besides how his death colors the lives of his remaining family. This is Harriet's book and concerns itself with how she navigates life with an absent mother and a bunch of racist aunts who'd rather talk over her than perceive her as a whole person, and as such maybe we shouldn't expect to find out what we wanted to know. At some point Harriet realizes that Danny Ratliff is the only person who's actually looked at her all summer and it's kick in the stomach especially since he's trying to kill her at the time. This was just what I needed, even though the ending is still unsatisfying, and I wish I was still living in this world."

Dodici anni più tardi, la sorellina Harriet (che all'epoca aveva solo sei mesi), si intestardisce a voler scoprire e punire il colpevole.Poteva essere un pretesto per una magnifica storia familiare (le prozie di questa famiglia sono straordinarie) e di formazione, con una bella evoluzione del personaggio principale. Le prime 130 pagine sono magnifiche.Poi la visione si allarga, altri personaggi entrano nel cerchio e tutto sommato va ancora bene, può sembrare l'affresco di un disgraziato paesino del Mississipi pieno di pregiudizi, fissazioni religiose e grandi discrepanze sociali.Invece inciampa in qualcosa che sembra un romanzo di azione, con due ragazzini che fanno cose più grandi di loro e una tensione insensata che cresce a dismisura con il procedere del romanzo e che però nel contesto c'entra come i cavoli a merenda.Peccato, perché la scrittura di Tartt è sempre di ottimo livello, ti trasporta nel luogo di cui sta parlando, ti fa sentire il caldo, il senso di soffocamento, il disordine della casa, i cattivi odori.Però il romanzo è privo di direzione e altrettanto lo è il finale."

Όταν όμως το έργο με το οποίο συστήνεται στο αναγνωστικό κοινό είναι κατά γενική ομολογία δείγμα πρωτοτυπίας και έξοχης γραφής, το να δημιουργήσει ένα ισάξιο δεύτερο έργο αποδεικνύεται ακόμη δυσκολότερο. Όταν δε έχουν περάσει δέκα ολόκληρα χρόνια από την κυκλοφορία του προηγούμενου έργου, κατά τη διάρκεια των οποίων αναμένεται ένα βιβλίο παρόμοιας θεματολογίας, η πρόκληση για τον συγγραφέα είναι ακόμη μεγαλύτερη και οι προσδοκίες του αναγνωστικού κοινού σαφώς υψηλότερες. Από τα τρία μυθιστορήματα της Tartt Ο μικρός φίλος είναι το λιγότερο γνωστό και προβεβλημένο, ενώ σημαντική μερίδα των κριτικών βρίσκει πως είναι το πιο αδύναμο της. Εύλογο αν αναλογιστεί κανείς πως το πρώτο συνέβαλε στη διαμόρφωση μιας ολόκληρης αισθητικής τάσης και έφτασε να αποτελέσει από πολύ νωρίς θέμα διδακτορικών διατριβών, ενώ το τρίτο κέρδισε ένα από τα σημαντικότερα λογοτεχνικά βραβεία και μεταφέρθηκε στον κινηματογράφο. Σε πολλά σημεία Ο μικρός φίλος θυμίζει πουαντιγιστικό πίνακα: ο τρόπος γραφής της Tartt είναι πληθωρικός, η γραφή της σε πολλά σημεία λυρική, ο ρυθμός της αφήγησης της νωχελικός, καθώς γεμίζει σελίδες επί σελίδων με περιγραφές και λεπτομέρειες – ψηφίδες που δεν φαίνεται να εξυπηρετούν την εξέλιξη της πλοκής, η οποία ούτως ή άλλως είναι ιδιαίτερα χαλαρή και αργή. Ωστόσο, οι σελίδες που δεν προωθούν την πλοκή συμβάλλουν στη δόμηση των χαρακτήρων και επιβεβαιώνουν το αστείρευτο ταλέντο και την ικανότητά της να αναμειγνύει είδη όπως το νεογοτθικό, το αστυνομικό και το bildungsroman στην περίπτωσή μας σε μια μεταμοντέρνα γραφή, για τα οποία την είχαν από νωρίς ξεχωρίσει οι καθηγητές-μέντορές της. Ο αναγνώστης γρήγορα διαπιστώνει πως δεν διαβάζει μια ιστορία μυστηρίου με καταιγιστικό ρυθμό, αλλά συνεχίζει αποκλειστικά για τη χαρά της ανάγνωσης, για την αισθητική απόλαυση ενός τόσο καλογραμμένου κειμένου και γιατί στις περιγραφές από την καθημερινότητα της ηρωίδας (στις αταξίες και σκανδαλιές, στην εξερεύνηση της γειτονιάς και στο ψαχούλεμα των συρταριών της γιαγιάς και του απόντα πατέρα) αναγνωρίζει στιγμές της δικής του παιδικής ηλικίας που τον πλημμυρίζουν με νοσταλγία για τα χρόνια της αθωότητας και πηγαίο ενδιαφέρον για τους ήρωες του έργου, σαν να πρόκειται για δικούς του ανθρώπους.Η Tartt πλάθει ένα ατμοσφαιρικό, κλειστοφοβικό, θρησκόληπτο οικιακό και κοινωνικό περιβάλλον, το οποίο αποδίδει άψογα η προσεγμένη νέα μετάφραση του Μιχάλη Δελέγκου. Υπογραμμίζει τα χαρακτηριστικά της ζωής στον αμερικανικό Νότο: μητριαρχία, περίπλοκοι οικογενειακοί δεσμοί, ανταγωνιστικές σχέσεις και συγκρούσεις ανάμεσα στις παραδοσιακές κοινότητες της περιοχής και ανάμεσα στους χειραφετημένους μαύρους και στα «λευκ�� σκουπίδια» –όπως αποκαλούνταν οι εξαθλιωμένοι λευκοί πολίτες–, παραβατικές συμπεριφορές και συγκάλυψή τους, βία, εξαθλίωση και μοιρολατρία. Δίχως να φείδεται χιουμοριστικών σκηνών, εστιάζει στην προεφηβική ανυπομονησία και ανάγκη ανεξαρτητοποίησης και δίνει έμφαση στα ηθικά διλήμματα των ηρώων της.Η έλλειψη –ή, ορθότερα, η χαλαρότητα– της πλοκής που αποτελεί το μεγαλύτερο μειονέκτημα του έργου αντισταθμίζεται με το παραπάνω από την ασύγκριτη γραφή της Tartt που καταφέρνει να κερδίσει και τους πιο δύσπιστους αναγνώστες αυτού του σύνθετου και πολυεπίπεδου νοηματικά βιβλίου. Άλλωστε δεν διαβάζουμε μια κλασική αστυνομική ιστορία: δεν είναι η αποκάλυψη της ταυτότητας του υπαίτιου του απαγχονισμού του μικρού Ρόμπιν το κεντρικό θέμα του έργου -αίνιγμα που η Tartt αφήνει τον αναγνώστη να επιλύσει μόνος του ή να αποδεχτεί την αδυναμία εύρεσης του δράστη-, αλλά η ψυχολογική και πνευματική εξέλιξη και η διαμόρφωση της προσωπικότητας της Χάριετ, του έξοχα πλασμένου κεντρικού χαρακτήρα. Με άλλα λόγια, πρόκειται για μια σπουδή χαρακτήρων, η πλοκή του έργου είναι οι χαρακτήρες του, η έμφαση δίνεται στην εσωτερική δράση, στην πρόσληψη των γεγονότων, στις αντιδράσεις απέναντι σε αυτά και στις συνέπειές τους και όχι τόσο στην εξωτερική δράση, στα συμβάντα και τις πράξεις που κινούν τα νήματα της ιστορίας.

Three of the seven chapters are mostly concerned with setting the scene; of those ""The Blackbird"" and ""The Pool Hall"" both felt draggy and too long. (I mention this only to hearten the reader, because you might, by the book's end, feel nostalgic for the setting; and because the action is worth the wait.) Two epigrams -- from Aquinas and Houdini! -- epitomize Harriet's ambivalence about the search for her brother Robin's murderer at the end of the book, rather than her fierce quest at its beginning. Ultimately the book concerns itself more with her changing methods and goals than with the actual outcome of the investigation. The reader who expects a pat ending or firm resolution will be disappointed.The reader who is willing to ride along and appreciate the view, without worrying too much about the destination, will have a good time. Tartt describes the world from low to the ground, so that even with a third-person omniscient narrator, we see everything as twelve-year-old Harriet does. Unquestioning of her family's eccentricities, she has a stubborn conviction in her own suspicious perceptions of outsiders. All the ambivalence of adolescence is here: she sulks, throws off her great-aunts' embraces, then cries when she loses her one remembrance of the housekeeper who raised her. Attempts to teach her about puberty insult her dignity, and she prefers to learn about ancient Egypt or Scott's expedition. She seems to embody all the strength of girlhood.Harriet's grandmother and three great-aunts -- Edie, Libby, Tat and Adelaide -- are a hilarious gaggle of Southern ladies who radiate gossip, Shalimar, affection, lace and baked goods. They reminded me instantly of every exasperating little old lady I have ever loved, and Harriet's relief, when she leaves her own chaotic home and enters one of theirs, is palpable. They also provide fascinating insight into how members of an old plantation family cheerfully but incompletely entered the post-Civil-Rights era. They, and the housekeeper Ida Rhew, are the emotional underpinning of Harriet's life and the novel.Most of the funniest bits come from outside Harriet's family. Tartt gets details of accents and seemingly meaningless social interactions dead-on. There's a mortifying Baptist summer camp that Harriet is driven to ""Welcome, ladies,"" he crowed, leaning into Edie's rolled-down window. ""Praise the Lard!"" (350)which is made even funnier by the fact that she only agreed to go in order to escape the long arm of the law. There is an entire family's worth of no-good trailer-dwelling Ratliffs -- who, in their essential irredeemable badness, reminded me of the Herdmans in the The Best Christmas Pageant Ever. (For excellent children's book references, see A.O. Scott's review.)In short, I greatly enjoyed this book. Perhaps the greatest compliment I can give it, though, is to confess that I can't wait to read it again and see what else I find; this is the kind of book where page 1 just naturally seems to follow page 555."

It looks as if it's going to be a murder mystery, but the story becomes a dark, twisted, gripping, and dangerous journey into the underworld of a small town. Here, we explore racial and social life with themes like coping with death and tragedy, neglect, revenge, happiness, and family dynamics. The cheating of death as the climax of the story is perfectly executed. The characters are well developed, and it feels like an adventure story in many parts of the book. I highly enjoyed the reread 🖤"

She is a master of painting shades in her tales, putting many ambiguities, circulating between dream-like scenes and pure realistic atmosphere.""The Little Friend"" is a Southern American Gothic novel which wants the reader to believe that it's a crime story and changing its mind after the first chapter.

121,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37410306,Rating 4 out of 5,"От трите книги на Дона Тарт „Малкият приятел“ ми допадна най-силно. Точно мой тип сюжет, който да те държи до финала и да те кара да искаш книгата да няма край. Книгата е изключително реалистична, изпълнена с много мрак, чудовища и лоши постъпки, но всичко това минато през детските очи, които просто искат някакъв вид възмездие. Хариет ни води из своята история, като ни допуска наистина доста навътре в своя личен свят и ни показва всички свои съмнения, страхове, съжаления и желания. Запознаваме се с едно момиче, което просто иска да разбере истината и когато си мисли, че най-накрая постига това, забърква такива събития, които белязват живота на героите завинаги. Типично в свой стил Дона Тарт изгражда героите си и техните истории изключително прецизно, през призмата на психологията. Всяко действие в книгата има своето последствие и няма празна дума или нелогично действие. Тарт не ни спестява нищо в описанието си на съвременния свят – той е грозен, крие големи опасности, особено за момиче, което се бърка в чужди, не много законни, работи. Книгата ни показва и една моментна снимка на съвременното ни общество. За семейството, в което единия родител винаги липсва. За промяна в децата, които остават незабелязани. За незачитането на чувствата на децата от страна на възрастните и как те понякога дори не се опитват дори малко да ги разберат. Приятелството между Хариет и Хийли също е за пример и ни показва как трябва да стоим за думите и действията си. Писането на Тарт и в този роман е същото – на моменти прекалено описателно, но все така красиво и омайващо читателя. Тази книга с една идея ми беше по-мрачна от другите, но сюжетът и героите го изискваха. По принцип аз съм от хората, които обичат да получават отговор на всички свои читателски въпроси в края на книгата, но този път, това, че след финала не разбрах някои неща, не ме подразни, а дори ми хареса. Като цяло и трите книги на Дона Тарт са злато за съвременната литература и ви ги препоръчвам с чиста (книжна) съвест. "
122,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12831990-jason,Rating 4 out of 5,"Though this is a book that has it's roots firmly lodged in a tragic murder, this is not a thriller, this is not to be read with the expectation of a linear murder mystery, this is a haunting coming of age tale; a Southern Gothic take on a twelve-year-old's summer vacation. But Robin: their dear little Robs. More than ten years later, his death remained an agony; there was no glossing any detail; its horror was not subject to repair or permutation by any of the narrative devices that the Cleves knew. And—since this willful amnesia had kept Robin's death from being translated into that sweet old family vernacular which smoothed even the bitterest mysteries into comfortable, comprehensible form—the memory of that day's events had a chaotic, fragmented quality, bright mirrorshards of nightmare which flared at the smell of wisteria, the creaking of a clothes-line, a certain stormy cast of spring light.Harriet Cleves Dufresnes, who was only a baby at the time, has become particularly interested in finding out what happened the day her brother died and who did it. Is it any surprise? This sibling and this event, that she has no memory of, seems to hang palpably over her life. An image of this long-dead brother even continues to stare out at her from stained glass at her Baptist church with a wry knowing smile. How can she ever compare to the light that was extinguished prematurely? His death is an open wound for her family that has festered and is causing internal decay, but it's not the only thing that haunts them, nor are they the only ones haunted in their hometown of Alexandria, Mississippi. The Cleves' loss of wealth and ancestral home still haunts them; on the other side of town you have families that are haunted by the memories of abusive parents and ruined childhoods; the African-American community of Alexandria are still haunted by the burning of churches and systemic racism; the town's own slide into degradation haunts all it's inhabitants. This is a story and a town cloaked in shadow and infested with fetid rot.Harriet's determined search for answers turns up a lot about her family, her town, and life during this summer. This meandering character-driven novel brings up more questions than it answers and truly is an exploration of humanity, with the topics of poverty, racism, class-ism, drug abuse, and mental health problems, among others all being touched on. Much of the book is an intimate and sad glimpse at a time not-so-long-ago in the American south.Tartt manages to portray a twelve-year-old's mindset exceedingly well, while also providing us, the reader, with a unique young lady - Harriet is incredulous, stern, and demanding, she wants truth and is overly confident in her abilities to uncover such truths and to understand them. I found Harriet to be unlikable at times, but you could almost always sympathize with her view. To me Harriet had a little something of Mattie Ross from True Grit about her (this is probably partially due to that book being read immediately prior to this one and Tartt having written the Afterword in my edition). All the other characters were complex and flawed as well, ranging from Harriet's loving if at times inadequate gaggle of female family members to the Ratliffs which are depicted with a certain Flannery O'Connor-ish flare, not to mention Harriet's devoted friend Hely, her caring housekeeper and some more minor but equally interesting side-characters. Harriet's adventurousness leads from one dangerous situation to the next and at times this story is truly frightening. She makes leaps of reasoning to certainty, but by the end the characters and the reader alike are rife with doubts. A great work of fiction, even if the overwhelming feelings are of regret, dread, and loss. "
123,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/123715572-jay,Rating 2 out of 5,"As the most obscure of Tartt’s three novels, I was hoping The Little Friend would turn out to be an unfairly neglected book, and that I’d find within it some hitherto unappreciated unique strangeness or quirkiness, misunderstood by the reading public at large, but which I could love nonetheless. Unfortunately, I’m sorry to report that the truth is this book gets forgotten about for the mundane reason that it tells a story that is almost entirely forgettable. The reality is as unexciting as that.There’s nothing in here that justifies such a bulky length, and where The Secret History and The Goldfinch are two books that simply work, irrespective of any literary merit which they may or may not exhibit, The Little Friend never crackles with the same kind of energetic fizzy pop. The switch from the first person of the other two books to the third person here explains some of this (Tartt seen through the lens of Richard Papen or Theo Decker is undoubtedly more engaging than Tartt seen all by herself, in direct line of sight); nonetheless, The Little Friend would still be an overstretched book – overlong and lacking thematic focus – regardless of the choice of narrator. Pacing is rarely high on my list of priorities, but reading this turned into a long slog. Some overlong books at least gain a weightiness as a result of the amount of time you spend reading them, whereas I find myself looking at my copy of this one and thinking, “really, all those pages just for that?”I think I know what Tartt was trying to drive at in this book: the torment of unresolved grief and how it leaves scars in both individuals and their wider communities for years and decades to come. But that’s a big theme that has, in recent years, been handled extremely well elsewhere (Norwegian Wood, Twin Peaks, The Leftovers, or even the thoroughly underrated Rectify… to name just a few). Tartt doesn’t do enough to make her book stand out among stiff competition. Her characterisation is, in fairness, strong, and the small-town-Southern-bible-basher-United States-style mystery story brought to mind something of the creepy atmosphere of the properly awesome first season of True Detective (yet another mystery story which is ultimately about grief), but there isn’t enough glue keeping everything in The Little Friend together, and so the entire book ends up feeling like a big load of nothing. The end result was that the conclusion failed to truly move me, and, now that I’ve finished it, I feel like its pages are vanishing out from underneath me; like I’m trying to hold a handful of water the contents of which are leaking away through the cracks between my fingers."
124,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/137867172-taste-in-books,Rating 4 out of 5,"Feeling a bit sad after finishing my final book by the sensational DonnaTartt. The Little Friend starts with one of the best Prologues I've ever read. Tartt but takes an instant to grab you as she sets the stage. You read about a seemingly innocent day of a family with three children playing in the garden, totally unaware where the scene is heading. You breathlessly read on with a persistent sinking feeling. By the time the Prologue ended I was covered in goosebumps. Not only with shock but also with utter awe of the fierce nature of the writing. And this was only the first 10 pages!!!We leave the Prologue twelve years in the past, where the baby girl Harriet playing in the yard is now 12 years old. A big chunk of the book is spent getting to know the family. Harriet's mum after the mysterious tragedy of the past is left a broken woman unable to cope with frail nerves and no mental strength to take care of her remaining two children. Harriet has grown up with her four great aunts. Each with her own chatacter, her own story and her own place in Harriet's life. The black housekeeper Ida has her own very special place giving Harriet any semblance of routine and family. On the other side of the class divide, we meet the local gangsters. A sorry band of brothers grown up doing petty crime and small time drug deals and jail stints. Tartt sets this story in a fictional small Mississippi town and creates a vivid landscape. Not just the physicality of it but the language, the culture and the racial and class divide of the 80's. The affluent family of Harriet and the trailer trash lives of the Ratcliff brothers. Harriet is fascinated by the stories of Houdini and practices holding her breath underwater. Danny Ratcliff is scared of water and never learned to swim. The two come head to head as Harriet makes up her mind that he is responsible for the tragedy 12 years ago. Most of the book is about Harriet and her friend Hely cooking up plans to get even, involving breaking and entering, staking their house, some very dangerous snakes and a whole lot more. If you really look at the 555 page book there isn't much going on in way of a plot and many readers would think it all drab and boring. For me Tartt's books are not so much about plots but journeys. It's all in her writing. Their tragedies and losses, mistakes and misfortunes. The childish Harriet and the poor unlucky Danny and the cards life deals them.Last 100 pages are suspenseful, riveting and edge of the seat as both Harriet and Danny come head to head and take us to a climax which some may say is inconclusive. To me this book was never about getting to that particular ""answer"" to the mystery but the journey."

Ši skaitymo kelionė buvo nelengva, bet verta laiko ir dėmesio. Dėl to knygą vertinti vienu balu atrodo kažkaip per paprasta – geriau pabandysiu padėliot pliusus ir minusus.Viena vertus, knygą skaičiau mėnesį. Dariau pertraukas, tad lėtai įsivažiavau. Nekartokit šios klaidos.Taip pat man pasirodė, kad autorė paliko palaidų galų. Pavyzdžiui, kodėl Alison nieko nepasakojo ir viską laikė savy?

Donna Tartt’s overlooked but crunchy and delicious masterpiece. We all devoured THE SECRET HISTORY but who among us has wagered a bet on this book?This is the south in the 1970’s. I’m familiar. But Texas was mine. Mississippi hers. This is the world of Aunties and thick heat. The world of lightening bugs and unlocked doors. Rednecks and “bless your heart” Black housekeepers who are more family than your actual blood and long stories about the past. The world of a single murder that opens the book, becoming the whisper of a ghost throughout.But the real treat besides the immersion into this descriptive world is 12 year old Harriet. She is the tuff talkin’, sass mouthin’ black haired, green eyed witchy girl who spends her childhood dirty knees and sweaty library books, chasing down that invisible monster who hung up her sweet brother on a tree when she was but a baby. Might I be so bold as to say she reminds me of Scout Finch.

I've also found brilliant the fact that the main focus seems to be on memories, their unreliability and partial knowledge of what's around us. I think this book is very subtle and it may say more than it seems. Surely I'll be pondering over it for some time!I was only left frustrated by the ending: this is clearly not a thriller about Robin's death, still I felt the book ended abruptly, leaving things open and uncertain.EDIT: I'm still thinking a lot about this book and can't wait to read it again so I don't care, for me it's a full 5-stars and definitely a new favourite of mine."

You will fall in love with Harriet. You will feel you know her house and Ida Rhew and Healy. You will think you have been to Mississippi and been bitten by its mosquitoes and watched its fireflies alight an inch from your head.

BUT I stand by my theory of Tartt’s utterly vivid descriptive style that sweeps us into an imaginatively evocative world that we would otherwise have no access to.So… rather than feed y’all some lengthy review recounting the numerous plot turns (dare I call them disappointing?) and sporadic alterations of focalizers (dare I call the shifts confusing?) that occur in this 555-page world, I figured I would instead paint you a panorama of the stiflingly idle and overbearingly tainted Alexandria, Mississippi where the story unfolds.A thirteen-year-old unruly girl, Harriet pursues the perpetrators responsible for her brother, Robin’s murder taking place twelve years prior when Harriet was just a baby. This Mississippi is hot, monotonous and streaming with racism, Sunday school and underground crime. Children spend their summers at Baptist camps, daylight hours are spent gazing out curtained windows listening to the obnoxius voice of the gameshow host on television, and nights are spent with a pint of peppermint ice cream and an overdue library book abandoned on the front porch. The lord is praised for right, the lord is praised for wrong, the lord is praised for right and wrong to come. Blacks are paid 25 dollars a week for sweat and labor. Blacks are shot at across the river. Blacks are accused and persecuted under the rightful and superior hand of whites. In this Mississippi only one train enters the Alexandria station: 7:14 am, and only one train leaves the Alexandria station: 8:47 pm. Overbearing grandmothers drive into highway ditches and ancient aunts protect against foul mouths and inappropriate non-christian behavior of the little ones. Snakes are feared and tantalized. 5-foot-long king cobra’s imported from a mysterious landscape in the far reaches of India are stolen by children and carried off in a wagon, and ultimately thrown over the county’s overpass with only one victim in mind: Daniel Ratliff, but as luck has it, the frail and shabby grandma Gem is instead the victim of this snake attack. In this Mississippi drugs are grown and consumed behind trailer homes on the far reaches of town. Powerful hands get away with murder and tattooed hooligans receive signs from God and become preachers in the street. In the hazy and dreary dust of Alexandria inhabitants wait all through the boring waking hours for peaceful exuberance promised in sleeping dreams…The hunt and revenge of Robin’s murder happens somewhere within the hodgepodge of elaborately atmospheric imagery that penetrates The Little Friend. I don’t know about you guys, but the plot itself (a semi-murder mystery that is pursued by a spunky, tom-boyish gal and her perhaps too-romantic buddy) and its characters made me feel stuck somewhere in between To Kill a Mockingbird and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. If it wasn’t for Tartt’s prolific use of language and illustrative descriptions of Alexandria, Mississippi, I’m not so sure The Little Friend could be saved… *tear*tear*Yours Truly,Delphine, the Babbler"

Roman je smešten u Misisipi za vreme '70-ih godina, i prati dvanaestogodišnju Herijet koja, zajedno sa svojim drugom Hilijem, pokušava da sazna šta se tačno pre 11 godina desilo njenom bratu Robinu koji je jednog dana pronađem obešen u dvorištu. Sa ciljem da otkrije ko je počinilac tog zločina, Herijet i Hili otkrivaju tajne malog mesta u kom žive i svakakvih ljudi koje viđaju svaki dan.Kako smo i navikli od Tartove, ona prenosi atmosferu ovog malog grada toliko realno da imamo utisak da se sve dešava ispred našeg nosa. Njeni likovi su uvek potpuno živi i suludi, pa tako i ovde - glavni junak nije samo Herijet, već cela zajednica, uključujući i njenu babu i tetke, crnkinje koje rade kao kućne pomoćnice u rasističkoj Americi, likove na kristal metu. Širok dijapazon genijalnih likova koje mogu da stvore samo Dikens i Tartova. Ono što je ipak bitno pomenuti jeste da ovo nije triler, iako počinje Robinovom smrću. Ko je ubio Robina je potpuno nebitno za priču, taj događaj je samo okidač za jednu priču o pripadanju, o tome šta je pravedno a šta ne, o osveti; ali i o jednoj maloj zajedinici na jugu Amerike, o rasizmu i siromaštvu koje je tamo prilično često. Donine rečenice su kao i uvek predivne, magične, atmosferične, te smatram da će vam se, ako vas zanima amerikana kao takva, ovaj roman zaista dopasti. Jeste najslabiji od njena tri romana (iako je napisan drugi po redu i izdat 2002. godine), ali daleko od toga da je išta manje od jako, jako dobrog."

Again....After adoring and obsessing's over The Goldfinch & The Secret History both of which are responsible for my life never again being the same, I obviously had to get this one too!It took me a very long time to finish this and I think this is partly because the position the reader is put while reading the book is very complicated. Harriet is not a good or bad kid and there were times where I rooted for her 100% and others when I thought she was being absolutely horrible and she knew better than to be that way. I thought the entire web of this family and the details included made for an unforgettable experience. Once you know so much about the characters you can't just forget them. I will never understand how its possible that Donna Tartt is able to create different settings as if they were her nature. There are just so many little things here (just as with her other books) that one could only know and be able to include if they were an insider. The message of the book starts as one thing and by the end has completely transformed and honestly books like this make me understand the need for book clubs. I am DYING to talk to someone about this!!!DYING!!Don't be a fool. If Donna Tartt so much as touches a pen or pencil, follow her and read whatever is under there."
140,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70047683-xenja,Rating 4 out of 5,"La Tartt è fenomenale nel trovare l’idea iniziale: tutti i suoi romanzi partono in modo strepitoso. Per fortuna non avevo letto la quarta di copertina né le recensioni e così ho potuto apprezzare come merita la sorpresa che chiude il primo capitolo. (Anzi non è stata fortuna ma lunga esperienza di lettrice: è un vergogna come gli editori, pur di vendere qualche copia in più, spoilerino i romanzi senza ritegno e li spaccino per quello che non sono.) Poi, è naturale, mantenersi all’altezza di una simile idea non è facile. Molti lettori restano delusi. Ma l’autrice non aspira, credo, a scrivere un thriller mozzafiato, con finale che tutto svela e risolve. E il suo romanzo si sviluppa e si conclude, secondo me, in modo più che accettabile. Si noti: detesto le astuzie cattura-lettore. “I cavalieri” di Winton mi ha fatto infuriare e si potrebbe dire che il problema è lo stesso. Quindi ho riflettuto sul motivo per cui “Il piccolo amico” non mi ha nemmeno irritato. Credo che il motivo sia questo: in questo romanzo c’è molto altro. Il ritratto non banale di una ragazzina, di una famiglia molto particolare, di una cittadina sonnolenta e squallida del Profondo Sud, dove gli anni Settanta non portano che lontane eco del movimento hippie, di una società piena di stagnanti pregiudizi e perbenismi, di un’estate che da noiosa e solitaria si trasforma in pericolosa, inquietante, dolorosa. Molto bella la scrittura, narrazione mai superficiale, e personaggi vivi, autentici, cui si finisce con l’affezionarsi. Se la Tartt si deciderà un giorno a scrivere un romanzo senza morti violente (in lei la tentazione del romanzo d’azione è troppo forte: è il suo difetto) sarà probabilmente bellissimo."

I felt like I lived and breathed the lives of the characters and knew them inside and out - which made it so captivating when I could focus my full attention on this. It was a really enjoyable read for me but also frustrating because it felt like the plot was completely lost after the first couple of chapters until the very last. Basically 3 stars because it was awesome but confusing and hated the end."
142,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2246876-p,Rating 2 out of 5,"It had potential and the blurb and first couple of pages captured my interest. But that was just a red herring, apparently.  I thought it was about a sweet little boy who is found hanging from a tree and how his sister Harriet (a baby at the time of his death) decides to solve the mystery of his death when she is twelve. Harriet, like Harriet the Spy, is a determined, no-nonsense type of girl any smart adult would be scared to mess with. But her relationship with her black housekeeper is straight out of junior Gone with the Wind. There are long sections about Harriet's selfish aunts whose tiresome conversations about material things (who bought what/where/for whom) grate on the reader's nerves. Harriet's mother is one of those self-indulgent women who use her son's death to fall into a decline for a decade or so and go about in their nightgowns, letting the underpaid servant do all the housework and parenting. And then there are the lower class Southern family--the Ratliffs--meth-addicted dealers starring in their own separate novel which is inspired by Phillip Dick. This other novel disjointedly intersects with the original one and the reader is at a loss. If you are wondering what happened to the little boy who was murdered and what these other characters have to do with that story, well you are not the only reader who feels cheated. What I want to know is--where was the editor when Donna Tartt turned in this draft and why didn't that individual put their foot down and send her back to the writing table to ruthlessly revise and chop down this novel till it fulfilled atleast some of the promise of its first two pages?"

If you're looking to read some Donna Tartt I would recommend you start somewhere else as this one may put you off.Not much happens. It's a big ole' book with a lack in action. Needless to say I did enjoy some of the plot - it just took a long time to get to the exciting bits! We follow a young girl named Harriet, we learn that when Harriet was a child her older brother Robin was found hung from a tree. In their suburban neighbourhood the question of whether the death was intentional has always been at the edge of everyone's mind. Robin was only a boy, could he of hung himself - or was it someone else? We come back to the story years later when Harriet is in her teens and she makes the decision to try and find her brother's killer. Along with her peppy young friend and a plan that may involve car chases, snakes and gun fights it makes for a novel that sounds pretty action-packed and appealing, right? It was slow, very slow. Plus the font in my edition was ridiculously small - I'm kind of surprised that I read it all to be honest!If you're a die-hard Tartt fan I would say that you would probably like to read this one but if you haven't read anything from her yet I would steer clear of this one!

È una delusione per una serie di eventi che avrebbero dovuto succedere e non succedono. Tutto sommato, la trama potrebbe anche essere piacevole, considerando alcuni elementi presenti: il delitto, il movente, insomma tutti quegli elementi che ne avrebbero fatto un noir perfetto. Quello che destabilizza e preoccupa di un romanzo del genere sono le sue quasi 700 pagine dove non accade nulla. I personaggi sono troppi e non si riesce ad affezionarsi a nessuno di loro. Si entra quasi in punta di piedi nella famiglia Cleve, colpita da una grave tragedia per la quale gli accenni sono davvero pochi. In questo romanzo manca la caratterizzazione dei personaggi, l'elemento noir tipico di questo genere e alla fine tutto appare sconclusionato, con un epilogo che lascia alquanto perplessi e molto disorientati."

152,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27203016-michelle-curie,Rating 3 out of 5,"Donna Tartt plays her readers like a fiddle. The Little Friend feels like witnessing other people's life in a way so intense and atmospheric that it almost feels real. And just like real life we experience high and lows as well as unexpected and somewhat unsatisfying expectations.Set in a small Mississippi town in the 1970s, we meet Harriet, a twelve-year old girl, who is determined to solve the mystery surrounding her brother, who was found murdered hanging from a tree ten years ago. The circumstances are not great: her mother has been barely functioning ever since losing her son and with an absent father it's been grandmother Edie and housekeeper Ida taking care of the children. It's the characters that Tartt paints like no one else can. They feel like people, they feel rich and real. It's hard to explain what Tartt can do that so few other authors can do for me, but her words make something come alive instead of describing it. You don't read about, but you can feel and touch things through these pages. With this being set in the Deep South, it's a thick and intricate Southern Gothic and yet more about a dysfunctional family than it is about a crime. Through Harriet's eyes, we learn what it's like to be an overlooked kid, someone in a tough world who doesn't get the attention or love she - or any child - deserves.I think The Little Friend needs to be approached with the right mindset. I am not sure I did and I have read (and loved) everything else Donna Tartt has written to date. Don't see it as a mystery, a thriller or crime novel, but a slowly unwrapping exploration of what it's like to grow up in Mississippi's claustrophobic and lonely 70s. "
153,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6542967-phoenix2,Rating 4 out of 5,"Donna Tartt is turning out to be one of my favourite authors. She can trully write some morally grey characters that are so appealing and appalling at the same time. The book, though long, has a nice flow, with the story being streched out throughout a narration that seems to be unimportant, but everything is part of the big picture in the end. The suspence, moreover, was high in the final chapters, with Tartt doing her best in having the characters reach rock bottom after a spiral of bad decisions."
154,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30521983-randee,Rating 5 out of 5,"I read Ms. Tartt's ""The Secret History"" last year and loved it. It was the first book I've read by her. I gave it 5 stars and it was in my top 5 favorites of 2014. I love this story even a little bit more. There is so much texture and layers of a story centering on a family in Mississippi and the child, Harriet, who is determined to find out who killed her older brother. It's not really so much about his murder. To me, it was more about a child growing up in the deep south. A small town where everyone knows each other pretty much, the haves and have nots. But mostly it gives an authentic portrait to what it's like to be a child...in all it's glory and yet in all the powerlessness one feels as a child. I found this beautiful in the same ways I find 'To Kill A Mockingbird' or 'Member of the Wedding' to be vivid accounts of childhood and the south. Donna Tartt is one of the best authors I've read. No matter what she writes, it feels interesting and authentic through beautiful prose. She has the ability to make the reader feel like, they too, are living the story. As I write, it is June 15th....almost halfway through the year and I have read nothing better so far this year. I can easily see this making the top spot of my top ten for 2015. Without a doubt, unless I hit the mother-lode of books in the next 6 month, I think I can confidently say it will definitely be in the top 5. It's just that good....I don't think there are many books that will give it a run for the top 5. Highly recommended. "

158,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/86941096-penta,Rating 4 out of 5,"Długo się zastanawiałam, jaką ocenę wystawić ""Małemu Przyjacielowi"". Prawdę mówiąc, w przeciwieństwie do większości, wiązałam z nim większe nadzieje niż z ""Tajemną Historią"", choćby przez sam fakt, że to jedyna powieść Tartt skupiająca się poniekąd na postaciach żeńskich, dlatego też byłam gotowa dać książce większy kredyt zaufania, ale też wiązało się to z większym ryzykiem zawiedzionych oczekiwań. Po trochu spełniły się obie opcje, jednak koniec końców nie jestem w stanie wystawić ""Małemu Przyjacielowi"" oceny dużo niższej niż debiutowi autorki. Ponieważ ""Mały Przyjaciel"" stanowi eksperyment z formą; nie zawsze udany, chwilami przeszarżowany, ale widać, że Tartt starała się otworzyć na coś nowego. Poza tym, niezależnie od realizacji, strukturalnie ""Mały Przyjaciel"" zjada ""Tajemną Historię"" na śniadanie.Za ogólną niechęć ludzi wobec tej powieści, winię (pomijając brak narratora-vaguely nie hetero białego typka) fałszywą obietnicę w opisie, ponieważ śmierć Robina nie stanowi tak naprawdę punktu napędzającego fabułę, a jedynie przewijający się motyw, z którego czerpią inne schematy wyginane przez Tartt w fantazyjne kształty, splatając razem w misterną przeplatankę. I uważny czytelnik prędko dostrzeże, iż sama *struktura* książki wskazuje, że nie ma tu miejsca na prawdziwą zagadkę kryminalną; że autorka bierze schemat prosto z powieści detektywistycznej dla młodzieży, by zderzyć go z rzeczywistością, jak w ""Tajemnej Historii"" zderzała romantyczną wizję intelektualistów żyjących poza normami w swojej marzycielskiej bańce. Niestety, jak wiemy już po samym dysonansie ""lektura ""Tajemnej Historii"" vs fani ""Tajemnej Historii"""", przeciętny czytelnik uważny nie jest. I będzie się nudzić. Sama chwilami się nudziłam, acz wynikało to głównie z faktu, że Tartt, chcąc utkać obraz świadomości zbiorowej, portret miasteczka tkwiącego niemalże w próżni, obiera za wiele perspektyw i nie wszystkie wychodzą jej równie dobrze. No, będąc szczerą, zawodzi właściwie jedynie punkt widzenia Hely'ego (Richard kogoś wkurzał? A spotkaliście tego gówniarza?), co faktycznie obniża przyjemność lektury, bo dzieciak ciągnie lwią część trzeciego rozdziału, na którym to utknęłam swego czasu.Odniosłam też wrażenie, że Tartt to jeden z niewielu pisarzy z jakimi się zetknęłam w ogóle, którym trzecia osoba, personalna czy nie, służy mniej od narratora pierwszoosobowego. Ja wiem, że monologi wewnętrzne Richarda czasem mogły przyprawiać o rolleye, ale jednak nie zdarzało mi się powoli tracić łączności z książką, tak jak niestety miało to kilka razy miejsce w opisach pomieszczeń czy wykonywanych przez Harriet czynności. Muszę jednak Tartt przyznać na plus, że ona wybitnie WIDZI różnicę pomiędzy tymi dwiema narracjami - obym się przykro nie rozczarowała przy ""Szczygle"".Po lekturze ""Tajemnej Historii"" pisałam, że jestem ciekawa, jak do kwestii genderowych podejdzie Tartt, pisząc z perspektywy dziewczynki - i uważam na start za bardzo ciekawe, że jedyny raz, gdy autorka dotyka kobiecego punktu widzenia, stanowi książka, gdzie narrator wycofuje się do bezosobowego głosu zza kadru, nigdy nie nasiąkającego w pełni myślami bohaterów, przez których oczy spogląda. Po lekturze 2/3 dobytku Tartt (minus krótkie formy? forma?) zaczynam odnosić wrażenie, że jest w niej pewien dystans nie tylko wobec patriarchalnie postrzeganej kobiecości (Allison, Tatty, Libby, Adelaide) ale też tej mniej oczywistej (Edith, Camilla); niemniej, w przeciwieństwie do wielu współczesnych autorek literatury kierowanej stricte do kobiet (tak, autorki NieZwykłego, o was mowa) nie wyczuwam w Tartt mizoginii. Wręcz przeciwnie, zdaje się wyśmiewać i potępiać mizoginistyczne zrywy Harriet czy Edith skierowane w stronę tych wrażliwszych, bardziej ""kobiecych"" bohaterek. There's only so many things, które można napisać w krótkiej formie o relacji autor-teoria genderu bez wjeżdżania ze spekulacjami, także tu skończę temat. Po prostu jestem nieco zafascynowana tą niejasną zależnością.Oczywiście, nie ma róży bez kolców i poza wspomnianymi wyżej dłużyznami, zapewne można się kłócić o podejście do tematu rasizmu przedstawione w książce. Nie mam dwunastu lat, ja wiem, że nie trzeba się z czymś zgadzać, by to jedynie przedstawiać i pozostawiać wnioski do wysnucia czytelnikowi, acz po prostu odniosłam wrażenie, że w tym wypadku komentarz nie tylko nie był w żaden sposób nowy w dyskusji, nawet jak na rok wydania, ale i jakiś taki... płaski. Podobała mi się głównie dekonstrukcja tropu czarnej niani przywiązanej do dzieci pod swoją opieką jak do własnych, tu muszę przyznać, że Tartt z pomocą tak niewielu słów, a przede wszystkim gestów oraz niedopowiedzeń (w tekście!) przedstawiła znakomicie emocje, które powinny temu towarzyszyć.No i, naturalnie, nie mogę się nie odnieść do zarzutów, że zakończenie jest rozczarowujące, bo - jak pisałam - to nie jest powieść z zagadką kryminalną. To historia o pamięci, o tworzeniu własnej mitologii; o tym, jak codzienne zdarzenia obrastają wraz z upływem czasu w legendy, a ludzie mają skłonność do szukania znaczenia we wszystkim, co przysparza im cierpienia, ponieważ przecież *nie może* być ono bezcelowym, ślepym trafem losu - nawet jeśli alternatywę stanowi skomplikowana i zupełnie pozbawiona sensu teoria spiskowa. Dla mnie osobiście fabuła sama w sobie wyjaśnia, że Robin prawdopodobnie sam się przypadkiem zabił w wypadku podczas zabawy, ale nawet jeśli się mylę, to naprawdę trudno mi być złą, bo to już drugi raz, gdy Tartt sięga po historię pozornie kryminalną, aby opowiedzieć przede wszystkim o ludzkiej naturze."
159,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,Rating 5 out of 5,"--------THE WRITING—------Donna Tartt writes like George Eliot but with cars and other modern things. It’s very bizarre and it makes her very dear to me. I wish more contemporary writers wrote like Tartt (or Ian McEwan, who has a similar quality, but I’m angry at him over Nutshell so let’s pretend for a few years he doesn’t exist). For example, here’s a passage where the 12-year-old protagonist, Harriet, is trying to hold her breath as long as she can. It’s not a poetic moment, but LOOK HOW BEAUTIFUL HER PROSE IS. Sixty-five seconds. The rose-pink stripes in the draperies had darkened to a bloody color and the light from the lamp unravelled in long, iridescent tentacles which ebbed and flowed with the wash of some invisible tid, and somewhere she heard a wasp buzzing, somewhere near her ear though maybe it wasn’t, maybe it was coming from somewhere inside her; the room was whirling and suddenly she couldn’t pinch her nose shut any longer . . . and with a long, agonized raps, she fell backward on the sofa in a shower of sparks, clicking the stopwatch with her thumb. For a long time she lay there, panting, as the phosphorescent fairy lights drifted gently from the ceiling. A glass hammer pounded, with crystalline pings, at the base of her skull. Her thoughts spooled up and unwound in complex ormolu tracery which floated in delicate patterns around her head.That’s just unreasonably pretty. Unreasonably ornate, to be sure, but don’t pretend you don’t LOVE IT. --------THE CHARACTERS—------1. HARRIET. Despite her super racist family (I know it's Mississippi in the 1970s but still) Harriet is a phenomenal character (and shares my dog’s name, so she gets bonus points). In some ways, her clever, trouble-making, decisive self reminds me of Lyra Belacqua from His Dark Materials. But Harriet is a little more stolid and mulish than Lyra. Maybe if Lyra and Wednesday Addams had a baby, that baby would be Harriet Cleve Dufresnes. Her melodrama kills me. When she goes to a Baptist summer camp she hates to escape a bad situation she got herself into, she thinks to herself, The power of the highland chiefs is broken. I have fled my country and gone to the heather. She’s very relatable to my own 12 year-old self. She rankles at adults’ assumptions that she must be preoccupied with things like clothes, periods, or dating: Harriet felt as though one of the gruesome transparencies of [the sex ed film] — all womb, and tubes, and mammaries—had been projected all over her poor dumb body; as if all anybody saw when they looked at her, even with her clothes on, were organs and genitalia and hair in unseemly places. Knowing that it was inevitable (“just a natural part of growing up”) was no better than knowing that someday she would die. Death, at least, was dignified: an end to dishonor and sorrow. That passage is very Harriet-esque: both poignantly adultish in emotion, and hilariously grim. This is another passage that illustrates how damn great Harriet is: With distates, Harriet reflected upon how life had beaten down the adults she knew, every single grown-up. Something strangled them as they grew older, made them doubt their own powers—laziness? Habit? Their grip slackened; they stopped fighting and resigned themselves to what happened. “That’s Life.” That’s what they all said. “That’s Life, Harriet, that’s just how it is, you’ll see.” Well: Harriet would not see. She was young still, and the chains had not yet grown tight around her ankles. For years, she’d lived in terror of turning nine—[her brother] Robin was nine when he died—but her ninth birthday had come and gone and now she wasn’t afraid of anything. She would strike now—while she still could, before her nerve broke and her spirit failed her—with nothing to sustain her but her own gigantic solitude. 2. HELY. He's an interesting character, but an annoying one. And a massive idiot of a friend. Sigh. You'll see what I mean. --------CRITICISMS—------The ending. God, the ending. Hated it. It was utterly abrupt and unsatisfying. I didn't expect the identity of Robin's killer to be revealed, it's not a genre mystery novel, but I'd have liked the events that happen at the end of the book to have even the vaguest attempt at a resolution. It practically cuts off mid-scene. And no, leaving the reader pointlessly frustrated isn't ""genius."" Literally any author can do it. What, precisely, does this contribute to the book? ---RANKING DONNA TARTT BOOKS---Having now read the complete bibliography of Donna Tartt, I can rank her books. It’s a no-brainer. The Goldfinch wins hands down. It’s the only one I added to my favourites shelf. The characters are unforgettable. There wasn’t a moment of dullness. The prose is sweepingly beautiful and yet intimately familiar and unadorned. And it’s so, so funny. This one comes in second. Harriet’s a great character, the plot is pretty decent, it never gets dull, especially considering how long and detailed it is. It just doesn’t stand out quite as much as Goldfinch. Finally, The Secret History is in deep last place. The characters don’t just suck; I couldn’t abide reading about them for as many pages as I did. They made my skin crawl. Not that they weren’t interesting. But, well, they were a little too real. I know people exactly like those characters (I majored in philosophy and classical studies, so it’s inevitable) and reading about them wasn’t exactly captivating. And, of course, the pacing on that book was so unbearably slow. Anyway, this book has persuaded me that, putting aside the Secret History, Donna Tartt is an incredible modern talent, and any future books of hers will be on my immediate to-read list. She elevates modern fiction. "

Instead, it's a study of a family pulled apart by the death - and it seems, murder - of a bright and energetic son, Robin, at 9 years old, which occurs at the very start of the book. After that, we pick up the story 12 years later with his youngest sister, Harriet, who is the main character.I loved Harriet although I found her very reminiscent of the protagonist in the children's book, Harriet the Spy by Louise Fitzhugh, and there are parallels between the two, for example, the way she is reared by the housekeeper and devastated when the latter leaves. However, this is a more developed character, and she doesn't spy on people out of sheer nosiness. Instead, this Harriet forms an obsession with who killed Robin, and embarks on a singleminded quest to dish out retribution to the person concerned. The finger is pointed by the housekeeper, Ida, whom Harriet loves and uncritically believes, and she sets out to 'get' Danny Ratliff, who already has a criminal record at the age of 20 and who was in Robin's class at school. The Ratliff family are a crime wave in themselves, and Ida holds a grudge from when they burned down a church, killing an old lady and causing her and others to suffer burns.The book is a rather rambling tale: it consists of over 500 pages of small print. Much of it is beautifully written and observed, with believable everyday life in a small town, the interactions of family and how people often get on each others' nerves, and lots of minor quirky characters. Contrasts are made between Harriet's own more privileged family, though they have fallen from their former grandeur, and the black women who work in their houses for low pay, and the 'white trash' Ratliffs, who live in an American Gothic setting which borders on the surreal. Danny Ratliff and his brothers live in trailers with their decrepit grandmother who trades on her various illnesses, and passes on her own pernicious views of how poor people like themselves are victimised, while disdaining the education that might help her grandsons escape their deadend existence. Her favourite, Danny's elder brother, is a psychotic who has taken on these attitudes as well as inheriting their deceased father's violent streak. These tendencies are worsened by his liberal sampling of the metamphetamine he manufactures. Danny also is hooked and becomes increasingly strung out, partly through his inability to sleep due to the drug.The Ratliffs' sense of persecution spirals as Harriet and her friend Hely become interested in what they are doing in the upstairs apartment which another of the brothers, who 'got' religion in jail, is renting. A guest preacher from out of town is staying: part of his ministry involves snakehandling, and he brings several boxes of snakes, which must be hidden from the landlord. The set piece where the two children break into the apartment is a tour de force. In fact, snakes figure largely in this story: I had no idea before that there were so many poisonous kinds in the USA. Unfortunately for Harriet, the brothers search for her afterwards, and she is drawn increasingly into danger. This suspenseful subplot contrasts with the languid life of Harriet's mother Charlotte - who has never recovered from Robin's death and spends most of the time lying around in bed, spaced out on tranquilisers - and her older sister Allison who lives a kind of dream existence. Harriet takes after her no-nonsense grandmother Edie, another character I liked, and finds it impossible to confide in her family. She only has Hely to turn to and when he is drawn away into school activities, he inadvertantly abandons her to the mercies of the Ratliff family.A lot of the book is in the style of 'slice of life', giving the flavour of life in a southern American town in what appears to be the 1970s from the various clues and references made. A lot of things are brought in and appear to be significant, but are then dropped - Robin's blackbird costume, a hat once found by an aunt on her bed when no one apparently could have entered the house, Allison's amnesia about what happened to Robin although she was out in the garden and was found crying, so it seems she was a witness. This would probably frustrate a lot of readers, but I found I could go with the flow - this isn't really a crime story despite the criminals, and the crime - if it was that and not a freak accident which happened to a little boy who liked playing Batman - is significant more for the way it has wrenched family life out of a precarious normality, and the impact it has had on the forming of Harriet's character. Only the very ending caught me out a bit when it veered off to a conversation between Hely and his older brother, but I think it is meant to point us to who 'dunnit'. The scene just before it, where Harriet's father mentions 'Robin's little friend, Danny' (presumably Danny is the 'little friend' of the title, which explains why so much of the book focuses on his viewpoint), leading to Harriet's horrified realisation that she might have been wrong all along, might also act as a reminder, when we read the final scene, that Hely's brother was also in Robin's class and therefore could have been a visitor to the house. . Ultimately the book is realistic enough that we never find out for sure who was responsible and whether it was murder or a childhood game gone wrong - as so often in real life. The book almost earned a 5-star rating, but is more of a 4.5 because there are a lot of bits which weren't really necessary even to the 'slice of life' aspect, and the Ratliff circus becomes a little too surreal to be believed at times."

Donna Tartt is focused on childhood traumas, death, coming of age, the slow social decay of the American South, lingering race inequality, crime, drug abuse, emotional dysfunction, and overall downbeat topics, though the two young lead protagonists are plucky and bold and inspired by adventure stories like Treasure Island, but they are quite innocent of the darkness lurking in the everyday lives of the people in their small town in Mississippi. It makes for another slow-burning story like her first novel The Secret History, but with a completely different setting, characters, and themes. I'd have to say I preferred the other story mainly as the topic of spoiled rich kids getting far too obsessed with Greek literature and philosophy was interesting, and there was a lot more overt tension in that story, whereas this one is more meditative and atmospheric. Still, she is a great writer who puts a lot into each book, so certainly was worth a listen, but won't be among my favourites."

165,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3169621-texbritreader,Rating 4 out of 5,"I bought this book without knowing a thing about it based on sale price and author recognition, Tartt is a writer whose name I remembered vaguely from the literary columns. A few days ago, realizing I needed a book for an overnight trip, I grabbed it haphazardly from my book pile while heading out the door.I found myself quickly sucked into the story of Harriet Dufresnes, a twelve year old girl haunted by the death of her older brother, Robin, murdered when Harriet was only a baby. I was impressed by the rich and accomplished rendering of Harriet's fractured Mississippi family: her devastated mother, an aging debutante, who fills her house with clutter and hides out in her bedroom; her highly-strung, emotionally fragile sister, Allison, who stumbles through life like a sleepwalker and her absent father, Dix, who has moved on to a new job and a mistress in Nashville despite remaining married.Much of Harriet's support system is provided by her straight-backed grandmother, Edie, with whom the child has a complicated and somewhat combative relationship and Edie's three sister's, especially the child's favorite, the soft, cuddly, and emotionally available Aunt Libby. These women represent the Old South clinging to it's traditions and exaggerated memories of past glories but they also represent stability and loyalty. Her best friend, Hely, a boy whose older brother was one of the deceased Robin's classmates, is her constant companion and co-conspirator. The boy, his brother, Pem, and their parents also provide a counterpoint to the Dufresnes clan; their house is bright and shiny, Hely's mother is youthful and active, his father a family man and Pem a carefree, handsome lifeguard at the pool.The other key player in the girl's life is the family's longtime housekeeper Ida Rhew, a black woman who cleans up, cooks and raises Harriet and her sister while their mother falls apart. I especially enjoyed the depiction of Ida Rhew, unlike so many writers Tartt does not sentimentalize this hard working, underpaid and unappreciated black woman or the several other African American characters in the story. Nor does she offer us a candy-coated version of Ida's relationship to the family or her feelings about them. The interactions between the races as presented here are some of the most accurate I have seen, especially in the period immediately after the Civil Rights Movement. Tartt also does an incredible job capturing the 1970's south; from the natural world full of heat and bugs, to the town full of emptying buildings bypassed by the interstate, to the child's life full of Country Club swimming pools and Baptist church camps, every precise detail rings true. And yet they flow naturally in the story, remaining organic and never feeling labored or artificial, whether she's writing about old television like ""Dark Shadows"" and the Patty Duke flick ""Me, Natalie"" or describing young teenage campers full of spite and sexual curiosity frosted with lip gloss; Tartt delivers a fully realized and recognizable world.The actual plot revolves around Harriet's desire to find out who killed her brother and how she becomes involved with the ""white trash"" Ratliff family of drug dealers and ex-convict preachers in the process. This is where I had some difficulties with the book, which draws heavily on the kind of childish perception, conflict and climax found in ""To Kill A Mockingbird."" Although the author does a decent job of depicting these unappealing characters and despite the fact that she manages to keep a lot of balls in the air plot-wise, this part of the story felt forced at times, occasionally silly and worst of all came to an unsatisfying conclusion. The labyrinth plot is woven seamlessly into the book, however, it functions like a Christmas tree providing a place for the writer to layer on her many wonderfully vivid characters and perceptive observations about the time and place in which the novel is set. The trouble is that the plot isn't worthy of the richness, but what was good was so good I'm still going to bump it up to 4 stars. "
166,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Little Friend...where to start? This one's a doozy, alright, and to force a Bret Easton Ellis comparison, The Little Friend is kind of the Glamorama to The Secret History's American Psycho. I will not elaborate on this any further. However one thing I will do is make a more sensible comparison, between Tartt's debut masterpiece The Secret History and her follow-up masterpiece The Little Friend.First off, Friend is a murder story that reveals the victim in the very first sentence but uses the unknown identity of the murderer as the main hook, and then slowly breaks apart that hook by tying it a vehicle that signifies plot momentum, and having that vehicle accelerate and slow down so many times the fragments of the hook are flying in your face, bouncing of the road, and the they're scattered everywhere and you can only sort of see them, glinting in the dust in the distance, and forget what their purpose was to begin with. A murder story like that, it's not really as compelling as a murder story (The Secret History) that reveals both the victim and murderer in the very first sentence, and then slowly, subtly delineating the tragic event as it builds up to it, until the suspense is rich and think and edible, if bitter strangely troubling. And then...she does it again, only this time it's all twisted around, and you know these people so well, are privy to this horrible secret for so long, and the suspense is aching, and haunting--every development sticks to you like a fly glue trap stuck to the side of someone's face on a scorching summer day, and the delivery is wonderful in in tragedy, pulled off not like a magic trick (as is the case with Friend, but a painting that fucks with your depth perception.I just read through that, and it seems I'm being overly negative toward The Little Friend. The novel is like a magic trick, sure, but a magic trick where the components that make it work are vaguely visible, and you can work at it, in your head, and figure out how the trick works, and it's also a really elaborate magic trick, whose parts are so complex they dazzle the human mind.So, as for the matter of the identity of ""the little friend."" Yeah, it's Danny. Danny isn't the killer, however, because ""the little friend"" isn't the killer. The novel is really about Danny, similar to how The Secret History is really about Henry, but different in that the former is the focal point of a far-reaching cultural criticism and the latter is a used for a straight-up character study. No, ""the little friend"" isn't the killer, but in that phrase's implication of childhood and merriment, it offers an instant clue as to the identities of the real ""killers"": Robin, Allison, and Harriet, themselves. I haven't yet worked out precise role each of them played in events of the hanging, but I am sure that it was an accident; they were ""playing.""I'll write more later, but the weed it a-callin' me to bed. Lots more to say on this though, and think it's a fantastic books that might not leave you with the visceral punch of The Secret History but leaves you at least as much to think about.Also if you have any thoughts on my theory about the killers, please do not hesitate to let me know!"

This novel dropped me right into the main character’s life and I felt like I had moved in. The novel is incredibly long and detailed. Every thought, word, and gesture is described precisely, so even a short conversation between two characters takes an entire chapter. I would not edit out a single sentence because this is how Tartt immerses us readers into this fictional world she’s created. The main character, Harriet, is one interesting and unique kid. She’s tough, brave, precocious, and loyal. I really liked her. I also enjoyed how the book explored race and class, and different subcultures of the South, like the religious snake handlers. This is the second book by Donna Tartt that I have read and I hope to read all her novels eventually. She’s a talented writer. "
169,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2058014-jk,Rating 1 out of 5,"This was bloody awful. I hated every single paragraph, yet blustered through trying to get somewhere with it. I really feel like I missed something, and I am absolutely baffled as to what it could be.I spent far too much time on this. It is five hundred (ish) pages of eloquent sentences describing absolutely nothing. The plot drifts along aimlessly, your eyes glaze over as you think about what's for dinner, and you begin to absolutely loathe every single character. I kept reading as I was sure this dullness had to go somewhere; the novel started off with murder, so surely a fantastic climactic ending was coming? No. If I hadn't been on a Balearic beach at the time of reading the final sentence, I would have screamed in frustration. Nothing is resolved, confirmed, or denied. I'd have been better off spending two weeks reading The Hungry Caterpillar back to back. At least it’s a book with a message.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the prose. It was vivid and picturesque; just totally pointless plot-wise. Imagine someone who loves the sound of their own voice telling you a long story about their trip to Mississippi. If someone had come along and ripped out ten pages or so at random intervals throughout the book, it would have had no impact whatsoever. Although I understand now that the book is more of a study of Harriet's character than a murder mystery, it doesn’t dull the blow of my sheer disappointment, not only at the climax, but during the whole sorry affair. Those justifying the book as a 'reading experience' certainly have a point: the atmospherics and lyrical prose are wonderful, but 500 plus pages of rambling nonsense is just a bit over the top.I felt so cheated by the plot: it whisked me miles from where I wanted to go, rather than bringing me to it. This book has now tainted The Secret History for me; a book I have been recommended many times. I doubt I will ever read it due to the way this abomination has made me feel about Tartt. It really is a shame."

This is true, however I did not perceive this as something that took away from the quality of the story. Tartt's writing style is something I already liked--I liked The Secret History and I loved The Goldfinch. Had I read The Little Friend before the others, I may not have stuck it out for this novel.Here's what I enjoyed about this book: This book takes place over one summer in Mississippi. The prose provided imagery of slow, hazy, late afternoons and nights that were sharp and alive. I could feel the boredom, frustration, and longing that the main character Harriet felt. I liked the way Tartt explored the relationship between Harriet and her aunts, the way she described the grief that gripped Harriet's mother. As a kid you want answers, and you want answers that are simple and frank. As an adult you realize that this is all but impossible. Harriet wants to understand why things are the way they are, and the reader will probably feel this too as he/she reads this book. Sometimes the answers just aren't there, so we fill in the blanks as best we can and confine what we know is true to memory.Edit 9/19/2017: Originally, I rated this as three stars. I still think about this book and like it more and more each time it comes up, so I've updated my rating to four stars."

And NO you cannot cry because someone scratched you in the eye, you'd be furious!It was like eating a cookie with all the necessary ingredients, but crumbles when you take a bite.

Don't let the description of this book fool you, it's not a murder mystery, but rather a coming of age story. It's just a pity that Harriet is extremely unlikeable and annoying. So unfortunately most of the time, I found myself thinking ""what on earth is this child doing?""

Ogni qual volta sembra che la tensione inizi a salire la trama si dilunga in descrizioni e vicende familiari poco congeniali al racconto. A tratti ho avuto la sensazione che si andasse fuori tema. Mi dicevo Ma perché? Cosa c’entra questo fatto?Il problema, a mio avviso, non sta tanto nel fatto che questo libro sia lungo o prolisso, quanto forse poco appagante. Se parti con l’idea (palesata dall’autrice) di scoprire chi ha commesso un omicidio e poi, in 700 pagine, non fai nulla di tutto questo, mi pare che qualcosa non giri a dovere. Il finale lascia un senso di smarrimento, come una lunga camminata verso la cima che, quasi arrivato, ti tocca interrompere per il maltempo. Comunque ben scritto. [63/100]"

Unfortunately, the blurb and the opening few pages might mislead some folks to believe that this is a Southern gothic murder mystery, but this could not be far from the truth. The murder of Robin, the elder brother of the protagonist Harriet, only serves as a launch-pad to explore the psyches of an esoteric set of characters from a small town in Mississippi, and all this is couched in the most delicious prose. Tartt has this uncanny ability to describe the details of the world she creates in such fine detail that it transports you to the setting of the scene with incredible ease. This book is easily the weakest in Tartt's triptych, yet at the same time is head and shoulders above many other works of contemporary literature. "

I thought Harriet was a fascinating character, and I loved how there was a big chunk of the book where she and Danny were depicted on parallel journeys. I also enjoyed reading about Edith, Hely, the wild Ratliffs, and the characters who never move past the tragedy (Allison and Charlotte). In a Donna Tartt book, you end with more questions than answers, and it does leave you craving a bit when you think you are going to get an answer but it never happens. I also would have liked her to delve into the lives of the Black characters, like Ida and Catfish, more. Overall, I really enjoy her writing and there are so many satisfying payoffs in this novel. "

But the novel has to be approached in the same way that McCarthy's SUTTREE or the works of Henry James are approached - this is an epic model of a period of time (in a particular region of America in this case), with a forensic detailing of that time and place as well as the many nuances of the characters who live in that place and time. There is also an enormous amount of wry humour in what is a long tragedy ever shadowed by the horror of bereavement."

183,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/105387858-stetson,Rating 3 out of 5,"The Little Friend is Donna Tartt’s second novel, coming after her celebrated debut one, The Secret History, which appeared a decade earlier. A decade or more per novel appears to be Tartt's regular pace as her third and latest novel, The Goldfinch, appeared 11 years after The Little Friend. Given that we are roughly a decade post-Goldfinch, it is possible a fourth Tartt novel is imminent.The Little Friend diverges markedly from The Secret History, both in terms of form, setting, and content. It is billed as a Souther Gothic mystery and childhood adventure/maturation story. It is set in Mississippi in the early 1970s primarily follows a young girl named Harriet Cleve Dufresnes, who resolves to discover the killer of her brother Robin. Tartt also grew up in Mississippi and would be similar in age to the protagonist, suggesting the novel likely draws from her personal experiences, specifically the experience of having a latch-key childhood in the South monitored mostly by extended family members rather than her parents. This autobiographical quality is shared by The Secret History, which is thought to be inspired by her time at Bennington College.The Little Friend's length, larger cast of characters, and weighty themes (loss of innocence, life and death, social division, religion, and decay) suggest ambition, but I think this is misleading. The novel should mostly be read as an attempt at ""genre turn."" It's Tartt's take on the girl detective story mixed with Southern Gothicism and elements of a bildungsroman. In addition to some of the obvious markers like a plucky female troublemaker (Harriet) leading a boy sidekick (Hely) around the Deep South (think To Kill a Mockingbird), Tartt lays the intertextuality on thick. There are both implicit and explicit references to many authors, works of fiction and film: Mark Twain, Rudyard Kipling, Robert Louis Stevenson, Flannery O’Connor, Charles Dickens, Truman Capote, Sherlock Holmes novels, Nancy Drew books, James Bond films, and many more. The confluence of influences force themselves on the reader but do little to enrich the characters or content of the novel. Tartt's use of reference appears to be mostly out of homage or are straightforward adaptations. These references mostly just serve to remind us of much better novels or much more deftly drawn tales of adventure and detection. There are some bright-spots in the novel. Harriet, described as ‘sturdily built, like a small badger, with round cheeks, a sharp nose, black hair bobbed short, a thin, determined little mouth,’ is a more psychologically pedestrian version of the Scout or Scarlet O'Hara. The charisma of obstinacy and persistence are retained without making Harriet overwhelmingly competent and intelligent (of course, some preciosity and ingenuity is allowed). This choice demonstrated Tartt's restraint and improved the believability of Harriet's character despite her literary lineage of brilliance and heroism. Unfortunately, Tartt's clumsy plotting destroys this characterization by having Harriet's fate rest on the fact she randomly like to train to hold her breadth. I think similar positives can be found in some of the other Cleve family matriarchs (Edie, Libby, Adelaide and Tatty), though there's a distance that exists because most characterization are filtered through Harriet's POV. Also, a lot of shorthand is used for other characters like the Ratliffs (basically Southern white trash). This includes Danny Ratliff despite being the titular character (Robin's Little Friend) and the other major POV character. Danny, who apart from being Harriet's prime suspect (largely unjustified by any real evidence) as the murderer of her brother is largely an unjustified character. He is just a default foil to Harriet, while largely being a blank creature of meager constitution lacking any propulsiveness. I guess this contrasts with Harriet and is a comment on the difference between youth and adulthood, but it doesn't work. Danny is just the most sane version of his addled family of meth fiends and miscreants, who seem only to serve a sociological purpose for Tartt rather than an emotional one.The novel also has a static and predictable quality to it, where the characterization more or less telegraph everyone's fate. We know Harriet is ultimately untouchable and will inevitably exit her charming adolescence into a less exciting adult life. We also know Danny and his family are ill-fated. Moreover, the story's instigating event, Robin's murder, is treated as a MacGuffins, and though this is often the case with murder mystery story that aim to be literature, it would have seemed more honest for Tartt to try and honestly resolve Robin's death even if the actual murderer was never discovered. Instead, it is almost exclusively a way to move Harriet from one place physically or psychologically to another. The Little Friend has been described as ""languidly atmospheric,"" which I feel is apt. Tartt seems to leisurely and discursively write her way to the end of a novel caring less about what she's trying to accomplish and more about the vibes the prose will send the audience's way. This is okay for patient, indiscriminate, and voracious readers (myself), but for those hoping for moving, remarkable literature that is worth returning to over-and-over and respects time and attention, then they should look elsewhere.

184,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45816851-mens-rea,Rating 4 out of 5,"My book blog: My Bookshelf DialoguesBook synopsis:Harriet was only a baby when her 9-year-old brother, Robin, was found hanging by the neck from a tree in the front garden. She and her sister, Alison, who was 4 years old were the only witnesses to the murder. More than a decade later, Harriet is 12 and no closer to finding her brother's killer than before. Desperate for answers, she becomes involved in the murder mystery which begins as an innocent, futile childish endeavor. But somewhere along the way, Harriet's life takes an unexpected turn to the horrifying underworld of this small town in Mississippi.Last year, in the summer of 2016, in an attempt to discover and read more great books, I referred to the Pulitzer winners list, hoping to find a fiction novel to love. I had heard of The Goldfinch before which seemed to have been really popular at the time with my friends on Goodreads. So I picked it up and that was my first introduction to Donna Tartt's writing. I was quickly enamoured. In 2017, I decided, I would read Donna Tartt's other two novels starting with, by popular opinion, the worse one, The Little Friend. With an average star rating of 3.43 and many fans utterly disappointed, The Little Friend was promised to be a disaster. Now, standing on the side of the river with those who finished the book, I look around me confused and perplexed as to why is everybody so let down. This novel is a true Donna Tartt representation; glorious, deep, overwhelming and tragic. But Robin: their dear little Robs. More than ten years later, his death remained an agony; there was no glossing any detail; its horror was not subject to repair or permutation by any of the narrative devices that the Cleves knew. And—since this willful amnesia had kept Robin's death from being translated into that sweet old family vernacular which smoothed even the bitterest mysteries into comfortable, comprehensible form—the memory of that day's events had a chaotic, fragmented quality, bright mirrorshards of nightmare which flared at the smell of wisteria, the creaking of a clothes-line, a certain stormy cast of spring light.This intriguing author does not rush her creative process. All three of her novels have been published a decade apart. This span of ten years is reflected on this second novel creating a divide. I'm not going to lie. The first 50 pages are rough. There is no clear directive, Donna Tartt seems to be all over the place, an iris jumping from one character to the next, lightly touching on one focal point only to transition to another. There is no clear protagonist, and Tartt tests her readers through a trial of info-dump and overwhelmingly detailed presentation of her characters. Still, I stayed with her. Admittedly, her novel threatened to drown me under a flood of words and paragraphs but I was determined to finish it. After all, Donna Tartt, in her beautiful chaos has a remarkable talent in painting a picture. And as it turns out, in the end I was glad she took her 50 pages time to introduce me and allow me to deeply engage myself with her characters.With distaste, Harriet reflected upon how life had beaten down the adults she knew, every single grown-up. Something strangled them as they grew older, made them doubt their own powers-laziness? Habit? Their grip slackened; they stopped fighting and resigned themselves to what happened. ""That's Life."" That's what they all said. ""That's Life, Harriet, that's just how it is, you'll see.You see, Donna Tartt was on a journey when writing this novel and she cordially invites the reader to hop on, sit down, enjoy the ride. The focus is on Harriet, an extraordinary 12 year old girl who is psychologically abandoned by everyone that matters to her. Everyone was so caught up on Robin's murder, their favourite son, grandson, nephew that they became emotionally unavailable for Harriet, anxious for attention and love. Along with her little friend, Hely, she makes a promise to herself to avenge her brother's death. This is where Donna Tartt turns around from behind the wheel and slaps you in the face and dares you to look around and see what happens.And–since this willful amnesia had kept Robin's death from being translated into that sweet old family vernacular which smoothed even the bitterest mysteries into comfortable, comprehensible form–the memory of that day's events had a chaotic, fragmented quality, bright mirror-shards of nightmare which flared at the smell of wisteria, the creaking of a clothes-line, a certain stormy cast of spring light.But this is not a story about Robin's death and the mystery behind the murder. This is about you and Tartt, in a room full of doors, full of posibilities. Donna Tartt chooses the door and takes you and one of her characters by the hand. You all walk inside and see what the actions, thoughts, feelings of one person can mean to that person but also, alarmingly, to other individuals and their lives. A single event causes a girl to think and behave in a certain way. It causes her to, years later, be in a specific place at a specific time. This single event, affects three different families, multiple tragically afflicted individuals and finally, ruins people's lives. In the end, Donna Tartt finally opens her last door and lets her reader, familiar now with Harriet and her family, to contemplate about the outcome.She was young still, and the chains had not yet grown tight around her ankles…Whatever was to be done, she would do itThere are more than one stories told in this novel. The story of Harriet and the story of the little friend. Donna Tartt leaves beautiful, well-placed little clues for the reader to come up with answers. And she creates a devastating plot, a truly tragic story, born from a series of happenings. The ending is fantastic; hinting towards a direction but leaving the possibilities open to interpretation. Honestly,I'm struggling to present a non spoilery review of this novel's greatness. It seems to fly over many people's heads and if you're not one to look out for clues and hints and word-games, it will possibly be a tedious mental workout to finish The Little Friend. It overwhelmed me too. It lost me and found me again, and finally, established my true admiration for Donna Tartt's art. I canot wait to pick up her next one!"
185,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/90950586-t6ika,Rating 4 out of 5,"(not/maybe) spoilers but idk what counts as a spoiler so it’s up to u to read or not the last one (4th);1. Tartt made an unexpected plot, -still confused.. compared to The Goldfinch this had more”layers”2. took me so long to read this in hours (in days I was actually fast if we don’t count the first 50 pages in oct/nov/dec), I truly spent this week reading3. good night4. I hate how I was expected to blindly believe what the narrator told me about the characters and not think about what was left unsaid, felt annoyed how the characters believed in anything what they had just heard or seen but maybe that’s the thing ab. this book..edit: Also whats up with the racial slurs overly used during few pages..? yes they did tell about the caracters that were using them but it was repeated so many times in a few pages that it felt wrongI know what the ”little friend” refers to but I hoped for a better explanation behind it OR I’m just too tired to understand it rnedit2:now that I’ve been away from the book&plot&characters I have formed a valid opinion; This book made me angry, the characters were unable to think logically or critizice their own thinking, they were immature and annoying too (yes I relate to Harriett a lot but she was still immature as well as we’ve all been)"
186,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14941179-anna,Rating 3 out of 5,"If it hadn't been for the pandemic, I may not have got round to reading 'The Little Friend'. Much as I adored The Goldfinch, a synopsis of 'The Little Friend' did not really appeal and a friend had accidentally spoiled me for the ending. However, I need involving and ideally long fiction right now and thus decided to trust Donna Tartt. I am torn about giving this novel three rather than four stars, as I appreciated how distractingly immersive it was. That said, I liked it significantly less than The Secret History and especially The Goldfinch. The great appeal is Tartt's writing, which has a fascinatingly rich quality to it, and characterisation. The weakness is the plot. It took about three hundred pages for anything of note to happen, then the ending after seven hundred pages seems remarkably abrupt and lacking in catharsis. Indeed, I'm glad of the spoiler that gave me realistic expectations. I knew that neither Harriet nor the reader would ever find out who murdered Robin. I did not realise the story would end with Harriet still ill in hospital and at risk from a miraculously survived Danny Ratliff, having realised he probably didn't kill her brother. What happened to Harriet next? Guess I'll have to make that up myself.The setting is 1970s Mississippi, in a family still struggling with the tragic murder of a child more than a decade before. The narrative centres upon twelve year old Harriet, a very vivid and well-developed character. She is smart and independent, while still being recognisably childish in her assumptions and obsessions. Her older sister and mother are distant, so she spends much of her time with her friend Hely and the black housekeeper Ida. Tartt is excellent at evoking the atmosphere and mores of the time, including pervasive racism and classism. The dynamics of Harriet's all-female family (sister, mother, grandmother, and three great aunts) are explored at great length, with an acutely observant eye. The bickering between elderly sisters is so perfectly convincing that it made me grit my teeth. The whole family gives the impression of being stuck, trapped by the past and ingrained habits, unable to look beyond long-established perceptions of each other. Harriet finds this understandably frustrating; her older sister resists it in a passive fashion. More than anything, this is a book about trauma and the havoc it wreaks on families. Not the most cheerful topic, but one that Tartt certainly does considerable justice to. As Harriet embarks upon a quest for revenge, her life intersects with that of the Ratliff family. Their depiction reminded me a lot of Justified, the TV show, and the Elmore Leonard stories on which it was based. The setting is very similar (to my non-American eye), as is the chaos of disorganised crime committed by families trapped in poverty and addicted to the meth they cook. I'm pretty sure Justified briefly featured an evangelical preacher who handled snakes. Much of the middle third of 'The Little Friend' involves snakes, both wild and captured for religious purposes. The snakes are almost uniformly threatening and dreadful. Indeed, this book is enough to put you off them entirely. While much of the narrative is meandering and gradual, periodically it explodes into extremely tense and shockingly violent scenes. Despite (or because of) the painstaking set up, these sequences feel nightmarish as they feature so many fundamentals of bad dreams: being chased, being trapped, deadly snakes, drowning, falling, etc. You could almost describe this as a horror novel; it certainly seemed Southern gothic to me. While memorable and utterly compelling to read, however, such frightening scenes didn't entirely add up to a coherent plot. As the reader's perspective is largely with Harriet, perhaps this was a commentary on the disorientating incomprehensibility of childhood. Harriet's visceral resentment about her life was convincing and made me sympathetic, despite the inclusion of other characters who've definitely been through worse. The novel definitely works as a character portrait of her, right up until it ends so arbitrarily. It's more depressing than The Goldfinch, which ends on a fairly hopeful note. By contrast, Harriet, her family, and the rest of the characters appear doomed. Donna Tartt's writing is amazing at carrying the reader away to another world. In this case, it wasn't one I greatly enjoyed visiting, although at least it took me away from the pandemic for a solid chunk of time."

Donna Tartt‘s writing is beautiful, I don’t think I’ve read another author who can write for so long about so little and still create gorgeous prose. If you’ve never read any of her work before though, I don’t think this is the place to start. It’s very slow paced and less about Robin’s death than the blurb would lead you to believe."

193,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21232850-ned,Rating 3 out of 5,"Twelve year old Harriett has spunk, and she’s conniving and intelligent, and she lives in the deep south. Sound like any protagonist you’ve known (Scout, the author)? Some might find these tedious, with extensive reveries and fastidious details about the day to day lives of her three great aunts and her grandmother, all without husbands. But this was a rich smorgasbord for me, and authentic to boot. What some overlook is the unique and unusual point of view: It is a rare author who captures the fears, hopes and anxieties of young girls. As it turns, these characters were born in my same year, so I understand that error (which is the source of one minor historical flaw in this book, more later). The old lady rooms are rendered in full (p. 138) “..they worked the crossword puzzle, with Harriet perched on the arm of (great aunt Libby’s chintz-upholstered chair. The china clock ticked blandly on the mantel, the same cordial, comforting old tick Harriet had heard all her life; and the blue bedroom was like Heaven with its friendly smells of cats and cedarwood and dusty cloth, of vetivert root and Limes de Buras powder and some kind of purple bath salts that Libby had used for as long as hrriet could remember. All the old ladies used vetivert root, sewn into sachets, to keep the moths out of their clothes; and though the quaint mustiness of it was familiar to Harriet from infancy, there was a tickle of mystery about it still, something sad and foreign, like rotted forests of woodsmoke in autumn; it was the old dark smell of plantation armoires.”And the plot? This started as a mystery, most engaging, but it did drag a bit. I sensed Tartt wanted to get this book off her chest, tell her childhood tale as true as she needed to, and I respect her for that. She understands men less well, but not bad for a young female writer. The hopped up Ratcliffe’s were entertaining, if a little overdrawn. Mostly, though, Tartt catches the agony of loss during death that Harriett and her sister have, that fresh understanding of the finality of death, that confuses her parents and great aunts (as adults, they deny death until they must deal with it, like so many). Children can capture a moment immemorial forever, as when Harriet realized (p. 62) “It would never wholly leave her, the vertigo of this moment; it would be with her for the rest of her life, and it would always be mingled inextricably with the dim tool-shed…the smalls of dust and gasoline- and three dead Englishmen beneath cairn of snow with icicles glittering in their hair.” This little girl has read the expeditions of Cook and extrapolates to her own mundane experience.But the characters carry this along, the precocious Harriett that sees clearly through all the hypocrisy and seeks fulfillment in clandestine nightly traveling. She is alone, her single mother having given up long ago when her only son and favorite child was found hanged at the tender age of nine. Harriett is determined to solve the mystery, and it becomes here secret quest. She rides above the other kids, and most of the adults, and her reluctant experience at bible camp reminded of some of my own experiences, as what happened to her friend where (p. 58) “…they’d forcibly cut his hair..” and when Harriet “…rather enjoyed the Bible classes – mainly because they gave her a captive and easily shocked forum in which to air her unorthodox views of Scripture.” Later, Harriet senses acutely her mother’s disappointment in her, (p. 396) “Sometimes, especially when the two of them were alone together she sensed keenly her mother’s disappointment that she was herself and not Robin. Her mother couldn’t help this- in fact, she tried touchingly hard to conceal it- but Allison knew that her very existence was reminder of what was missing, and in deference to her mother’s feelings she did her best to stay out of the way and make herself small ad in conspicuous around the house.”One might consider this a coming of age girl’s story, and Tartt knows this well, and brilliantly capture the adult advise from a sanctimonious adult (p. 407) as when “She felt degraded by Nursie’s blithe assumption that she-Harriet- was no different from these stupid Tupelo girls: preoccupied with under-arm odor, the reproductive system, and dating. The haze of deodorant and “hygience” sprays in the changing rooms; the subbly leg hair, the greasy lip gloss: everything was tainted with a slick oil of “puberty,” of obscenity, right down to the sweat on the hot dogs”. Really funny stuff.This was very fine writing, thoroughly enjoyable and unique, but a tad long. One error is the transplantation of cooking amphetamines to 1972… a couple of decades before this became the norm in the U.S. But it only bothered me a little bit, the story was strong and the writing exceptional. It did take me over a month to read this, a little heavy at times."
194,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/153014865-lisa-gamboa,Rating 4 out of 5,"A thriller like I have never read before. Tartt paints the unresolved american south with watercolours, dilluting the mystery with familial pain and grief, and creating an absolutely striking story."

196,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13984676-lee-foust,Rating 4 out of 5,"Perhaps the best 19th century novel of the 21st century. So far anyway.Despite the relative anachronism of this type of omniscient, panoramic, semi-historical, Balzacian or Dickensian narrative, The Little Friend is an update of the classic southern pseudo-Gothic novel, focused on the grandchildren of Atticus Finch, dealing with the same Southern literary preoccupations of evil, class and race, as its predecessors. (Before you exclaim damn superior Yankee! in my cyberface, let me say that I read such novels with great interest and sympathy, that my mother's family history lies in a hazy mythic--for me, California bred and raised--swatch across Oklahoma, Texas, and back to New Orleans, with a French Maternal surname to prove it--Dumont. I could here digress on my father's side and my own All- or Pan-American mythic history which such a novel tempts one to do with one's own family history but...) Here, Tartt focuses, in my opinion, on resilience and poison, in its many forms, which sometimes kills, sometimes weakens, or in many cases, makes us stronger. Although it's easy to call a novel focusing on a twelve-and-a-half year-old girl a ""coming of age"" story, the loss of innocence is not the focus here--rather the age of the heroine provides such a realistic narrative with an aura of eternity that turns the adult's everyday world (figured by the newspapers stacked in Harriet's home here) into the child's mythic reading of the world, where everything is of a cosmic significance.I enjoyed The Little Friend more than Tartt's first, best-selling novel, The Secret History, which is also pretty good (three stars) for its greater ambition and its more personal and urgent revelations. There are moments/passages of great beauty and a few flaws--judging it only by the standards that such a narrative itself creates. The one great improbability of the tale is sold fabulously in a scene that I could only envy--as a novelist--for its cleverness and utter believability. The story is engrossing and the characters well drawn and worth presenting.While I brayed at the two protagonist's strange moral or a-moral choices and actions, this also made them all the more fascinating and real. The panoramic approach works quite well in most instances, moving in and out of the heads of novel's key characters, but it does take a while to figure out who they are/will be exactly and there was one character--Allison, the heroine's, Harriet's, sister--who is either too lightly or too heavily drawn for me--that is to say, she's interesting and detailed enough to make me want to read/see/understand much more of her and to feel cheated when she goes to sleep or locks herself in the shed to cry and by my never getting to experience her point of view satisfactorily in the various scenes of which she plays a key part. If I were the novel's editor I would have suggested either more or less of her, so as to avoid cheating the reader's expectations/desires. Also the novel never quite gives away its exact date, which would be OK if there weren't so many perfectly datable pop culture references--going from Dark Shadows on TV in '68 to movies and music as late as '75 or '76, the variety of which left me with the impression that the author didn't really know exactly when to situate her story. If I had not lived these years, turbulent and changing--from mid-Vietnam/Summer of Love to a post-Watergate malaise--the vagueness might have been suggestive, but the contradictory nature of the references rather came off as a careless mistake, given, again, the strictly realistic and factual nature of the narrative that recounts the events of a quite particular summer.The tale, like most long, realistic narratives, starts with a bang, drags a bit--and even seemed to hiccup momentarily, as if the narrator lost their place, a time or two--in the middle, and then rushes to a thrilling climax--I swept contentedly through all 200 pages of the final chapter breathlessly. The ending and the wonderfully unexpected moments (although one was a tad dishonest) were pleasing as well. Particularly well done was the build up to the chapter entitled ""The Funeral"" as we are given several distinct possibilities before the final revelation of who is going to die and need a funeral.So, worthwhile themes with an engrossing narrative and a few flaws that one might expect from such a hugely ambitious piece of work. Nice to see a contemporary do such good work--even if, as I said, the form is a tried-and-true (and some would say tired) one."

Darei una gamba e mezzo braccio per scrivere come lei. Ma anche no, se a scrivere così bene si finisce per specchiarsi in se stessi con tanta avidità che narciso, in confronto, sembra un ragazzino modesto e per niente infatuato di se stesso.Per capirci: si era detto che fosse la storia di una bambina/ragazzina che va alla ricerca di chi ha ucciso il suo fratellino. Bene, non è tanto verosimile ma può essere interessante.E ALLORA PERCHE' CAVOLO MI SONO DOVUTA SORBIRE NON MENO DI DUECENTO PAGINE IN CUI SI PARLA DI VECCHIE ZIE E DI SERPENTI???? E NON C'E' NEANCHE L'OMBRA DELLA STORIA CHE CI DOVEVA ESSERE???DONNA TARTT????? MI RISPONDI???????***(edit)ecco qua, l'ho finito, con i miei soliti ritmi lenti di lettura, e adesso ve lo racconto.dunque: a metà del secondo capitolo, la bambina Harriet decide che il suo fratellino, ucciso dieci o dodici anni prima, è stato assassinato da un certo altro bambino, con cui era solito giocare. Ne è convinta la vecchia tuttofare della famiglia di Harriet e la bambina le crede.Seguono sei capitoli (intendiamoci, capitoli da settanta/ottanta pagine l'uno) nei quali si parla di: moltissimi serpenti di ogni tipo, anche velenosissimi, che però non ammazzano mai; un esercito di vecchie zie più o meno fuori di testa; una madre completamente fuori di testa (la si può capire, dopo l'uccisione di un figlio di nove anni); una famiglia disfunzionale con un fratello drogato, un fratello spacciatore, un fratello predicatore, un fratello ritardato (termine politicamente poco corretto, ma non sbagliato, nel contesto dei personaggi che lo usano), una nonna crudele; un campeggio detestabile; un venditore di auto molesto; un incidente stradale mortale; una vecchia tuttofare che se ne va, offesa da un malinteso che nessuno ha voluto chiarire, e altre millecinquecento cose che adesso dimentico.Al termine di questa epopea, la bambina Harriet ruba una pistola del padre (siamo in America, se un bambino vuole una pistola la trova in casa, senza tante fisime su concetti sinistrorsi come sicurezza, pericolo, tutela e roba così), attraversa la città, si inerpica su un serbatoio le cui basi, dalla descrizione, ricordano molto la torre Eiffel, convinta che i membri della famiglia disfunzionale ci abbiano nascosto qualcosa di brutto; viene inseguita da uno dei membri della famiglia disfunzionale (che nel frattempo ha ucciso uno dei suoi stessi fratelli per ingannare il tempo), lotta con lui (una bambina contro un uomo), vince (nel senso che gli sfugge e lui resta lì , probabilmente defunto) e quando la ritroveremo in ospedale (perché tanto bene non se la passa neanche lei), ci verrà ricordato che il tizio con cui ha avuto lo showdown è quello che lei riteneva essere l'assassino del fratello e che per questo l'aveva voluto uccidere. Che è un falso storico, perché la piccola Harriet, trovandosi sul serbatoio per scoprire che cosa ci era stato nascosto, aveva cercato disperatamente di nascondersi al tristo figuro, senza riuscirci, quindi non è affatto vero che lo avesse cercato.Libro eccessivo se mai ce ne fu uno, ha almeno duecentocinquanta pagine di troppo (quelle della famiglia disfunzionale) e un serio problema di coordinamento fra le parti iniziali e finale, da un lato, e quella -ahimè lunghissima - centrale, dall'altro.Per essere onesti bisogna anche dire che si è letto di peggio; ci sono momenti - quelli delle scorribande dei due ragazzini solitari per la loro cittadina bruciata dal sole, quelli del dolore della ragazzina per le perdite, quasi contemporanee, della amatissima vecchia tuttofare e di una zia - che sono potenti ed emozionanti; così come il primo, breve, capitolo dedicato alla morte violenta del fratellino aveva lasciato sperare in un libro che fosse tutto allo stesso livello di emozione intensa e non patetica. Ma anche qui, come quasi sempre, la lunghezza della narrazione annacqua la qualità; non so se la Tartt sia obbligata per contratto a scrivere libri di dimensioni inquietanti o se si dia lei stessa questo obbiettivo, ma è evidente che dovrebbe usare un enorme paio di forbici e forse diventerebbe brava come crede di essere."
198,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5," Tartt could literally write a book consisting 100% of descriptions of sunlight moving across a room, clutter in a house, and different types of trees overhanging a footpath and I would still love it. She almost does that here lol. The Little Friend is long, very descriptive, and meanders constantly - but Tartt writes her characters and the Mississippi setting so well that it's just a joy to read. It's a leaves-a-hole-in-your-life-when-you-finish-it type of book.Donna Tartt is a genius and she's 3/3 for masterpieces I reckon."

I warn you: this is gonna be a mess.The Secret History is my all time favorite book and I really liked The Goldfinch so to say that I had high expectations is pretty much an understatement. Were those expectations fulfilled? Sort of. Yes. Not completely. First of all, I really enjoyed The Little Friend. It was an intense but really enjoyable experience and I’m glad I have finally read all of Tartt’s works. Let’s start with what I really liked:— this was a really atmospheric read. I felt like I was in the dusty city of Alexandria, Mississippi, and could feel the oppressive heat on my skin.— that Southern Gothic goodness— that ‘summertime sadness’ feeling. Yep, I’m quoting LDR here, #noregrets. You know when it’s summer and it’s really hot and you’re bored out of your mind and you have nothing to do and you feel sort of melancholy? I felt like the book conveyed that feeling perfectly. Added to that, that haunting feeling of melancholy and decay, as if the past had taken over everything — the characters, the city itself, everything. — those fascinating characters that felt so real. Harriet — the heroine — has become of my favorite literary characters. I loved how there were multiple POVs, which was quite a change from her two other books.— and of course, that beautiful, beautiful prose of Tartt’s. So now, you’re probably wondering why I gave The Little Friend a 3/5 rating? Well, here’s why: it was dragging on and on and on. I don’t mind slow-paced books. I mean, The Secret History is my favorite book so really, I don’t mind. But this was a bit too much here. Some parts were quite unnecessary in my opinion and could have been cut. If the book had been written by anyone else, I would probably have been bored very quickly. But the prose made up for it. Also, at one point, I kind of forgot what the story was all about? Oops.And finally, let’s talk about the ending. It was a very frustrating ending that left me screaming but thinking back on it, you can argue that it fits perfectly the book — I won’t say more but it’s the same kind of frustration that you get at the end of The Virgin Suicides. You’re still left with more questions than answers.I still loved that book and prefer it over The Goldfinch. It’s not The Secret History though and it doesn’t try to be. If you liked TSH or The Goldfinch, you should definitely give this a try — if only for the writing.(and I really hope that review makes sense lmao)"
200,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/95022267-conita,Rating 3 out of 5,"2.5/5⭐️just finished reading this book and i have to agree with everyone that said it wasn’t bringing any good to donna tartt’s writing history so far. the secret history is honestly the best book i’ve ever read and i was hoping for something as fantastic as that with the little friend, so disappointed to say that i was left lacking. it started out explaining to us this whole murder situation that our protagonist, harriet, wanted to solve out. she is a smart kid that’s filled with lacking throughout the story, which was something that caught my attention at first. she doesn’t have a functional family, a dad, mom or a sister, she doesn’t get the opportunity to be an actual kid, considering all she wanders about in her life is about her older brother’s murder. now that was captivating at first, but then, for some reason, the story took another slow paced way that just didn’t sit well enough for me. after chapter 3 i could feel density in the story and didn’t quite get where it was going, which bored me enough to abandon the book for a couple of weeks after chapter 6. i wasn’t really enjoying how repetitive and how it didn’t feel like it was going anywhere soon. the mystery wasn’t solving, things weren’t adding up and it just became straight boring. i’m very sad about not liking this book as much, even though i love donna’s writing and her existentialism that was also very present in here, as an analysis of childhood trauma and how to understand a kid that has always been surrounded by troubling matters, even as a youngling, it just wasn’t… good. and i have to say how MAD i am about the racial slurs. those weren’t necessary at ALL and they were SO PRESENT at all times that at some point i just didn’t get why i was still reading. i understand the context in which this book is placed and how racial slurs were present at the time, but the overuse of it doesn’t justify it. and after all this, what gives me more reasons to absolutely dislike this book, is how the murder was barely mentioned after all. closure isn’t given, the plot is all over the place. messy, without sense, and SO LONG. i’m still going to read the goldfinch this year, with hopes that it absolutely destroys this bad opinion about tartt. i hope this novel is just her worst work so far, cause after reading something like the secret history i just want to think —for my own sake— that some authors just have fantastic and awful works at some point of their lives. hope this one is just that."
201,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57671004-nina-ive,Rating 5 out of 5,"Since The Goldfinch, Donna Tartt has been on my author ‘high alert’ list. One of those you anxiously await a new release and recommend to anyone who might appreciate it. I’m working my way backward and was looking forward to reading The Little Friend. It did not disappoint. The central character is 12 year old Harriet. She deserves a place in literatures strongest, gutsiest female characters list. When Harriet was a baby, she was playing outside with her older sister Alison, when their 9 year old brother was tragically killed. There was never any closure around the death. It was classed as murder, but no suspect ever found. This history stifled Harriet and Allison as they continued to live and grow. Their mother took to her bed and a decade later is still permanently tranquilized. The father lost patience with the lack of resilience and moved to another town. The girls are left to bring up themselves, largely unsupervised, but with the kindly oversight of the hired help Ida and the more detached and domineering Grandmother Edie.Harriet however, is not like the others in her family. She has a mission. She feels the presence of her brother and wants to solve the mystery of his death. Even though she is only 12, you are given enough evidence to support her strength of character, inquisitiveness and intelligence to believe she might actually do it. She quickly hits a hot trail and systematically follows it. Of course, this trail leads Harriet and her trusty friend Hely into the thick of some serious bad-guy territory. Harriet and Hely become entangled in the meth induced paranoia of the Ratliff family. Somehow, they manage to stay just one step ahead, until inevitably, it all catches up on them. The final chapter is full of action and will have you seriously worried for Harriet’s survival and on the edge of your seat until the last page. When you reach the last page, you will turn it again, looking for the next chapter. It’s just not enough. Too many questions. Was Harriet successful in her mission? What happens next? There are enough seeds sown to draw your own conclusions, but I like it sown up! Maybe we will see Harriett again some day? I hope so."

Vamo-nos construindo à medida que vivemos.Assim são estas personagens.Quanto à história em si, esta já é outra questão.Continuo a afirmar que este livro teria muito a ganhar se tivesse tido uma BOA revisão por parte da autora. Uma revisão com pelo menos 100 páginas retiradas. E isto é a dizer por alto.O livro começa de forma trágica.Em plena década de 70, numa família tradicional, um menino morre de forma horrenda. Não há outro modo de dizer.Num lindo dia da Mãe, Robin Dufresnes aparece morto. Ou será que foi assassinado?O choque é tal que destrói alguns laços familiares, já de si trémulos, e lança uma sombra sobre a família Dufresnes.Anos mais tarde, a sua irmã mais nova, Harriet Dufresnes, no alto dos seus 12 anos, decide descobrir a identidade do assassino do irmão e levar a justiça ao seu alpendre. A bem ou a mal.A seu lado tem a companhia do seu melhor amigo Hely.À medida que a história se vai desenrolando, vamos conhecendo os mistérios que a pequena localidade de Alexandria esconde por detrás de cada porta.Alexandria uma vila na mais profunda raiz de um Mississippi, repleta de conflitos racistas e sociais por resolver. É aqui que a maestria de Donna Tartt se revela. Até nas mais simpáticas personagens vemos como a discriminação social e racial deixou marca bem profunda na forma de pensar, ser e atuar.De início esta Harriet lembrou-me uma Jean Louise que adorei conhecer. A minha adorada e corajosa Jean de ""Não matem a cotovia"".Mas ao chegar aos últimos capítulos, vi que até esta criança foi contaminada pelo preconceito e discriminação característico deste Mississippi retrógrado.À medida que percorria as muitas páginas, o crime, o mistério, foi deixado em segundo plano para me concentrar nestas vidas. Muitas delas tristes, pobres, mas tão comuns. Algumas delas nem chegaram ao último capítulo intactas.E o ""pequeno amigo"" não era de todo o que eu pensava, ou QUEM eu pensava!"

This is Tartt's second novel--braced between her first & third in so many decades--& it is clearly her middle child, neglected in all sorts of ways.Don't get me wrong, Tartt is a very good hack. She structures periodic, multi-clausal sentences like a pro who's had ten years to revise them. EVERY sentence is unnecessarily effusively descriptive: twee-ly perfect & utterly gritless. To take but two random samplings as evidence:""Even now, Weenie's death had the waxy sheen of the linoleum in Edie's kitchen; it had the crowded feel of her glass-front cabinets (an audience of plates ranked in galleries, goggling helplessly); the useless cheer of red dishcloths and cherry-patterned curtains."" (355)""Her blood pounded, her thoughts clattered and banged around her head like coins in a shaken piggy-bank and her legs were heavy, like running through mud or molasses in a nightmare and she couldn't make them go fast enough, couldn't make them go fast enough, couldn't tell if the crash and snap of twigs (like gunshots, unnaturally loud) was only the crashing of her own feet or feet crashing down the path behind her."" (436)In sum: this unnecessarily lengthy book doesn’t deliver: she doesn’t resolve the primary mystery. Is it supposed to lead us to ask “interesting” questions like: “Is Tartt--like the director Michael Haneke--intentionally withholding from her audience?” “Is Tartt subtly mocking Brett Easton Ellis by refusing to gratify her audience’s interests?” “Did she forget to finish the novel?”I will listen if someone gives me reason to believe I am being ungenerous in my assessment of this novel.

Mi spiego meglio: di solito Donna Tartt si concentra su una trama e la sviluppa dall'inizio alla fine con un filo logico, seguendo evoluzioni dei personaggi molte volte totalmente sbagliate e da non prendere come esempi. Questo è quello che mi è sempre piaciuto nello stile dell'autrice.Ne ""Il piccolo amico"" la trama parte su un incidente/omicidio che cattura l'attenzione del lettore, ma si sviluppa su tutt'altro fronte, ovvero dei ragazzini ""sconsiderati"". Lo so, non so spiegarmi bene, ma dovete leggere il libro per capire in che modo Donna mi abbia totalmente ingannata nel primo capitolo della storia che stavo per affrontare.Sicuramente ho apprezzato quest'opera, mi è piaciuto come al solito lo stile di scrittura e sono stata totalmente catturata dai lunghi capitoli... ma quelle prime pagine mi avevano riempita di aspettative e non riesco a fare a meno di chiedermi quanto sarebbe stato bello costruire un thriller su quell'unica scena.Non posso farci niente, con questo romanzo va così.Amo ancora Donna Tartt?

205,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/118169883-maritza,Rating 5 out of 5,"I believe that 'The Little Friend' is the most ambitious and best-crafted novel from Donna Tartt. Even though ""The Goldfinch"" is my most favourite, the situations, descriptions, feelings, the atmosphere, the ambiance created by Donna Tartt in ""The Little Friend"" is outstanding, admirable, unique. A dreadful crime committed against a child, Robin, is the starting point to show how this affected every member of his family. For those looking for a mystery novel, this is not. This novel goes deep into feelings, shows different people under very different circumstances, brings this southern ambiance from Harriet's family and some criminals' family (not the murderer, as this is not about the perpetrator), their daily lives, their fears, and their persecutions, all, all is contemplated here. There are descriptions that seemed impossible to depict and Donna Tartt accomplishes to make these images appear in such an accurate, precise way. She simply can express whatever she wants ! I simply admire that mastery and I still have many of these images in my mind. And still, the innocence of these kids remains, the irresponsible parents whose neglection on their kids made all their adventures possible, friendship, loyalty, endearing aunts and endearing Ida. Also, the first half of the book was difficult, I did not know where all these descriptions and characters were going, and all of a sudden all this made sense, all this was necessary to establish the grand scenario leading to a second-half of the book impossible to put down."

The family live under the shadow of his unresolved death, and at 12 Harriet finally decides to find her brother's murderer but soon becomes entangled in a dark and dangerous game....If you're looking for a fast-paced, break-neck thriller mystery then move right along; however, if you're looking for some exquisite prose, poignant passages about loss, grief, and friendship, and a slow-burning story then you've found the right book. You really need to take the time to savour every word of The Little Friend, so make sure you have the time (and patience) for it! It took me 5 days to read, which is a long time for me, but I thoroughly enjoyed it..The strongest point of this novel is by far Tartt's characters. Oh Harriet, stubborn, bloody-minded, inquisitive, calculating, courageous Harriet; one of my new favourite characters in literature, and yes I did take a lesson in adjectives from Donna Tartt! There are no shortage of great characters, from the four Aunts to the redneck Ratliffe family, all are fleshed out in insane detail so you are fully immersed in the small town life of Alexandria..Tartt doesn't shy away from addressing heavy themes like grief, drugs, revenge, religion, and race, and does it all so elegantly. The ending was also one of the best climaxes I've ever read! I think at times though it was a little too slow, even for me."

Così Donna Tartt esamina le proprie radici, imprime la propria esperienza nel personaggio di Hariett Cleve e pone alla base di quello che sembra essere un Thriller (o un noir? O un giallo? O un romanzo di formazione?) un mistero da risolvere.Hariett è intelligente, determinata, caparbia, vittima di una infantile logica per cui i giorni si susseguono in un alternarsi di giochi e di doveri come una lista di sfide personali da portare a termine prima della fine dell'estate, ma è anche limitata dall'inesperienza dovuta all'età, dall'incapacità di comprendere la vita degli adulti, dall'ossessione nel rievocare il fantasma di suo fratello creato dalle memorie della sua famiglia, dalla letteratura per ragazzi che rappresenta l'ultimo baluardo dell'infanzia e dei momenti felici.Nonostante la poca coesione del romanzo, visti i numerosi personaggi e l'unica voce del narratore onnisciente, ""il piccolo amico"" ricrea nostalgicamente il Mississippi degli anni '70 per raccontare ricchezze e povertà, la disgregazione di una famiglia e il clima di fanatismo religioso dove fattori sociali e culturali talmente ramificati ed insidiati fanno perdere contatto con la ragione. La scrittura magnetica di una fuoriclasse come Donna Tartt conferisce un aspetto di perenne tensione ad un libro a tratti cruento e autoreferenziale."

Dopo aver amato immensamente Dio di Illusioni ci siamo avvicinati alla sua seconda opera, Il Piccolo Amico, con grande entusiasmo. Il libro ambientato nella Bible Belt americana e scritto a dieci anni di distanza dal primo si presenta subito come una lettura impegnativa, sia per la lunghezza sia per il tipo di scrittura. Immersi in una prosa controllata e meticolosa, dove nulla è lasciato al caso, vediamo ogni cosa acquistare uno spessore e un peso narrativo fuori dal comune, a tratti quasi difficile da sostenere. Ve ne parliamo bene sul blog. Link in bio EnglishHere we are at the second stage of our reading of Donna Tartt’s novels. After having immensely loved The Secret History we started the reading of her second work, The Little Friend with great enthusiasm. The book set in the American Bible Belt and written ten years after the first one, is an intensive reading not only for the unusual length but also for its peculiar style.

That doesn’t sound so good and it might not even be 3 stars worth, but more of a 2.7. I did stop this book to read 2 other books in between and that is why I was probably able to finish it and not abandon it. Harriett and her family were interesting and worth reading about, but I did not care for the chapters about the Ratliff family. So, in truth, I didn’t like half of the book. I guess I didn’t care much for the plot, I would have rather have read about Harriett’s family and the aftermath of Robin’s death rather than a ""sort of"" mystery with a bunch of creepy guys. The writing is really good and I didn’t even mind the weak ending that many complained about, but in the end it wasn’t worth it. With that said, I do love Tartt’s other books enough that I will read whatever she publishes in the future. (Sorry for the weird review.)"

The Little Friend is beautifully written, it's main character is wonderful - reminiscent of both Scout Finch and Frankie (in Carson McCullers' A Member of the Wedding), and the plot is twisty enough to keep you up all night reading. I hate the cover because I think it makes you think that it's another kind of book, but I must say that unlike my experience reading most books, I resented every moment that I wasn't reading it (like when I had to go to work)."

The first half -- which plays as a hyper-detailed but amusing, funny, and endearing slice-of-smalltown-Mississippi life -- is easily stronger than the second half, at which point Tartt seemed to realize the story would have to try to go somewhere. For me, it never really did. Stuff happens, and it's interesting because of the richness of Tartt's writing -- like looking at a super-high-resolution photo -- but plot-wise it's weak, and it grows much weaker when we realize that the rationale for the whole endeavor is a misunderstanding. There just aren't any stakes.And I never did learn who the little friend was.Still, the book soars often enough that I would've kept reading if it were twice as long.I'm a Tartt stan, what can I say."

Astounding prose aside, I couldn’t connect with this one. Doesn’t change the fact that the Goldfinch is still my #1 read of all time and Tartt is a master at her craft and I am a fan for life. I will add, however, that like in GF, she really understands grief. I could have read more from the mom’s POV and been highly satisfied.

222,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2422229-joe-kraus,Rating 3 out of 5,"I am as big a fan of The Secret History and The Goldfinch as anyone. I think each is a modern masterpiece, and I think Donna Tartt is one of our most gifted contemporary writers on the strength of the two of them. But this one, released a decade after the one and before the other, lacks the dark urgency of The Secret History and the vast canvas of The Goldfinch. It has a powerful kernel at the heart of it, but it’s too small a story to carry the weight of its 600+ pages.The idea at the heart of this sounds impressive. A little girl, Harriet, comes to understand the inexplicable murder of her brother years before as having been perpetrated by a down-on-their-luck family of drug dealers and dubious evangelicals. With her precocious intelligence, she tracks down what she thinks is the real evil without understanding that evil is ultimately beyond comprehension. It’s a coming-of-age narrative with a twist – a twist of a knife where we can never see the hand behind it.But there are all sorts of small matters that detract from that powerful central notion. For one, Tartt introduces a number of characters who, in the end, don’t contribute all that much to the story. We don’t need to see so much about Harriet’s sister or about the inner lives of her many aunts. The characters are likable enough, but they blend together somewhat, and they ultimately distract from what seems the central point about exploring the possibility of evil as a child. A little of such characters would have accomplished as much as the couple hundred pages we get of them.For another, Tartt jumps from perspective to perspective. At times that has the virtue of placing Harriet’s questioning in a different light, letting us see through her eyes as a thoughtful detective and then see her through others as a little girl trying to find her way. At other times, it gets clumsy. [SEMI-SPOILER] In the scene where Danny and Harriet confront each other at the water tower, the action gets slowed as we switch from one pair of eyes to another. Sometimes, to my annoyance, it gets repeated.There are parts here that venture into noir territory – what else can you call a novel that opens with the awful murder of a 13-year-old boy – but Tartt eventually shows (SPOILER: through the contrived way that Harriet survives the showdown with Danny) she doesn’t have the stomach for that. She blinks, and we get instead something that returns to the safety of conventional narrative.Overall, I’m afraid I found myself checking how much I had left simply too often for the book to feel like a complete success. Tartt writes excellent sentences, and sometimes I’d linger over a particularly strong line, but the narrative just kept slowing down. I’d be curious to see the “studio-cut” of this, the roughly half-as-long book that would tell the same story with the excess cut out.At the same time, I know what Tartt did before this and after, so I think the smart play remains to leave her to her own devices. This won a lot of awards when it came out 15 years ago, so maybe it’s just aged badly. In any case, with Tartt seeming to take a decade between books, I continue to look forward to the next one she rolls out, presumably in five more years."
223,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/65084977-suzanne,Rating 4 out of 5,"Set in Mississippi in the early 1970s, the story starts with the death of little Robin, who was hung from a tree and whose murderer has never been caught. His death leaves its mark on his family: mother Charlotte gets depressed, hardly ever leaving her bedroom, and father Dixon moves to Nashville ""for work"" and almost never goes back home, leaving Robin's younger sisters Allison and Harriet (a toddler and a baby at the time of the murder) in the care of their housekeeper Ida and grandmother Edie. For the two girls, Robin becomes a mystic ghost of a brother, whom they idealise to no end. Years after his death, 12-year-old Harriet decides to take justice into her own hands, and together with her friend Hely she sets off to find and punish the murderer of her brother.This was the first novel by Donna Tartt that I have read. I would not exactly call it a fun novel and it was quite dense, but Tartt is a master at writing characters and setting. The story centrals on Harriet and her quest, but it also offers the perspectives of multiple other characters and the side story of the Ratliffs, a local redneck drug-dealing family. These different perspectives made the story very rounded and multifold. Besides the murder mystery plot, the story also explores multiple other themes through the many different characters and their relationships, such as racism, poverty and friendship. The American south in summer was also described beautifully, Tartt really makes sure that you feel as if you are right there with Harriet. This novel really has made me want to read Tartt's other novels, The Secret History and The Goldfinch!"

225,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/150283923-anna-praill,Rating 5 out of 5,"I fear this book may be the unsung hero of Donna Tartt’s catalogue. I found this hard to begin with, not necessarily through any fault of the text, but because I was expecting something that this is not. I think in a lot of ways The Little Friend is betrayed by its description. This book is pitched as a murder mystery, an exploration of racial tensions and crime in 1970s southern America. This book is not that. The Little Friend is about trauma, and how trauma sinks its teeth into the two central families of this story. It’s about neglect, the death of childhood, nostalgia, and grief. I ended up getting through most of this in audiobook form, which I think can help with a lot of the dense, intensely descriptive passages (classic Donna) that, when reading, honestly gave me a headache.This book is too long, as I find her works usually are. But it a way, I wanted it to go on forever. Out of the three, I found this to be easily the most immersive and moving. I genuinely found myself crying a few times during the final chapter, which surprised me. Harriet is 100% her best protagonist. I didn’t have as much fun with her as I did with weird, bisexual, drug addict Theo or freakish, sociopathic, loser Richard, but that doesn’t matter. I feel like I actually know Harriet. Like she’s a real person that I’ve experienced a life with. I don’t think I’ve ever had an experience quite like I did reading this.There were flaws, and I don’t know if I should give this five stars. It was hard work, and at times I think self indulgent. You can feel her riding a The Secret History high with this one, like she was so confident it stunted her ability to rework a few things that could have made this perfection for me. That said, my gut is saying five and I can do whatever I want this is MY GOODREADSI don’t want to spoil any of this because I want quite a few of you to actually read it. I think this book was always doomed to fail. To be her under appreciated middle child. It feels so awesomely ironic that her book about neglect has been consistently neglected by her readers. Don’t read this looking for another The Secret History. Don’t read it looking for another The Goldfinch. Don’t even read this looking for what the back says is The Little Friend (I actually will never forgive that blurb for lying so badly). Just go in with an open mind and a lot of patience because you’re going to have to suffer through some lengthy descriptions of grass and snakes to get to what is, in my opinion, Tartt’s most fully realised work."

For better or for worse, Mississippi people are just built different and miss Donna Tartt is not immune to that. Idk I think you have to experience childhood in the south to fully appreciate this one and maybe that was the problem for some people. Did any of my questions that this book raised get answered? Not at all lmao and it's better that you know this going into it. But it's Donna's world and I so enjoy living in it and will happily go wherever she leads. I love how we get everyone's story: the main characters, the side characters, the characters who pop in for two seconds or who we never even see. As a nosy person, I enjoy all of these little asides. Maybe hot take and don't kill me but I loved this so much more than The Secret History by like.... a lot. These characters are just so damn likable!! Especially little miss Harriet who I'm pretty sure was inspired by Donna herself. We love a woman who is her own muse!! Harriet's relationship with Ida leading her to question the world around her was so beautifully done. None of us are born prejudiced; it's something that's taught. I think the book summary has maybe mislead people into thinking this is a murder mystery (it's not). It isn't asking ""who killed Robin?""; rather, it's examining what happens to the people who are left behind in the wake of unspeakable tragedy and how it affects everything going forward. I'll re-read this a million times "
227,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35744860-emma,Rating 5 out of 5,"I love THE SECRET HISTORY, I liked THE GOLDFINCH, and I’ve had THE LITTLE FRIEND on my shelf for quite some time, but been put off b/c the terrible reviews. Then I finally picked it up and LOVED EVERY SECOND I SPENT READING IT!!!I’m not sure why the rating is so low, perhaps Tartt’s readers expected more dark academia, perhaps they felt misled by the blurb (understandable) but the book itself is VERY Donna Tartt. It’s detailed and character driven, beautifully written, atmospheric, and explores the inner workings of her characters’ (sometimes twisted)minds. The characters are complex and no one is 100% ”good” or ”bad”. They’re flawed, but even the worst of them has some (if tiny) redeeming quality. I love that we get so many different perspectives, but my favourites were Edie (loved all the great-aunts), Harriet, and (surprisingly) Danny. I loved the setting (the American south in the 1970s) too: the way it’s was described, the way she showed the racism through Harriet’s eyes, the crazy religious people, the rednecks.I could gush about this book and my love for Tartt and her writing forever, but I won’t. I’ve discovered that if a book has an average 3.4-3.5 rating there’s as much a chance I’ll love it as hate it, it usually means that the book will appeal to a smaller audience than the +4 rating, but that those who love it will LOOOVE it. (This is the second time I read a Tartt book and think about Maggie Stiefvater, I don’t know why?! It’s just a feeling I get: they’re both experts at creating the perfect atmosphere and amazing characters (love or hate them, but they’re well crafted), and maybe it’s because they both tend to give us the perspectives of the “villains” too, the POV from adults and children? I DON’T KNOW, b/c their stories don’t have a lot in common, but this FEELING I get when reading them.)"
228,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1377720-deborah-edwards,Rating 4 out of 5,"Rarely has a book stirred up so many conflicting emotions in me. My love/hate relationship with “The Little Friend” makes it difficult for me to review in any coherent, linear fashion, so my apologies in advance. And there may be spoilers. 3.5 stars but I'm rounding up.First of all, the book is too long. I know, I know – the descriptive elements, the extravagant attention to detail, the elegant, hazy, evocative fragments of a Mississippi childhood full of crazy aunts and backyard theatrics, and real and imagined dangers, and meth-making poverty-stricken troublemakers, and…little friends…is why so many people love this book, but it is also why so many readers could not finish it. On the one hand, Tartt writes like a dream. You can see every single scene as if it is laid out before you, like a painting or a walking play. No detail is too small to be left out. No conversation too irrelevant to be ignored. And yet, in some ways, its greatest strength is also its greatest flaw. The descriptions are sheer perfection in their rendering, but there is just too much of a good thing. The reader can see that Tartt becomes lost in these reveries, lovingly recreating every moment, every cicada chirping, every wafting blade of grass, every item in the pantry, but so often these vignettes lead nowhere (not that they have to, I understand that) or lead to their destinations far too slowly, which creates a real problem for me with the pacing of the book. I know there are books that can be savored for their lush descriptive elements alone, and I love many such books, but this book gives us many reasons to expect more urgent pacing (the murder at the book’s beginning, the quest for answers, the Ratliff family, the SNAKES!) and too often leaves us to meander through page after page of minor characters who never matter and side trips that bear no fruit. So, I loved the writing and was frustrated with it in equal turns. I nearly stopped reading at least three or four times. So, why did I keep going?Harriet.Despite the issues with length and pacing, Harriet is one of the more interesting characters you will ever meet. This fierce, independent, inquisitive little pit bull of a girl is a force of nature. You keep reading just to find out what she will do or say or think next. Her relationship with her friend Hely makes for some of the strongest passages in the book for me, even when some of their antics become far-fetched, and their dialogue seems natural, born of a stage in life when everything is important, everything is “life and death” and you can only share it with your best friend. Harriet is navigating a difficult youth with a massive amount of bravado. Her brother has been murdered, her father has all but abandoned the family, her mother is useless, her sister vague and elusive, and the only person she seems to love is the maid she inadvertently gets fired, but, through it all, she has convictions and goals and a certain self-confidence born of her intelligence and interests. I would recommend that people read this if for no other reason than to meet Harriet Dufresnes. Okay, now for the meat of it all. Who is “The Little Friend,” who murdered Robin, and what is this book about anyway?Donna Tartt showed us in “The Secret History” that crimes often go unpunished. In that book, we knew who the culprits were, but society never would. Sometimes terrible things happen and no one is held accountable. We all know this is true, but as readers, we all want closure. For Harriet, the lesson hits hard. Her goal in life was to take revenge on the man she thought had murdered her brother, when in fact, he hadn’t murdered anyone, until the end, when his own brother is the victim. Had Harriet’s meddling caused that relationship to grow violent? Had it spurred the paranoia that caused events to escalate? We are left to wonder. And Harriet is left with a secret that will haunt her forever.We may not find out the identity of Robin’s killer, but there are many candidates for the title “Little Friend.” Harriet herself is the little friend to others in the book, Hely is her little friend. We learn near the end that rather than being an adversary to Robin, Danny was his little friend. These characters and others in the book start out in the usual world of childhood until something changes that world. For Danny, poverty and drugs changed his world and erased the promise of childhood. For Harriet, loss and tragedy mark the end of her childhood. For Hely, entitlement and popularity mark his transformation. Somewhere along the line, we all make the transition, we all stop being “the little friend” and have to decide who we are going to be in the world, how we are going to interact in a place so fraught with pitfalls and hardship. It is no mistake that the family homestead in the book was called “Tribulation.” This is a book about suffering, about difficulties, about things not turning out the way anyone hopes. The characters in “The Little Friend” have little control over the socioeconomic system in rural Mississippi that has guided their fates to a large degree. In the same way that Danny and the Ratliffs are born into their destinies, and Ida Rhew and Odean have little control over their lot in life, Harriet is born into the legacy of Tribulation. The only thing these characters have that is truly their own is how they react to their particular trials. A family from a home called Tribulation is surely going to have their share of sadness. But even when that home is torn down, erased from town history, nothing but a cornerstone, they all miss it terribly and remember it fondly. Isn’t that just life? All of our stories are tinged with loss and sadness at one time or another, some more difficult than others, but usually there is a nostalgia that recalls the sweeter memories of childhood and makes us willing to relive the past, no matter how difficult."

Им, прочитанным лет девять назад, зажглась любовь к Донне Тартт. С желания поговорить о нем началось знакомство с Либом - впервые зашл�� на сайт, еще как робкий посетитель. Да тут же и вышла, изумившись, что авторы бойких, недурным языком написанных рецензий, сплошь недовольны книгой, укоряют в том, что она не ""Тайная история"".Им, хотя позже, началось восхищение Настей Завозовой, в моей тогдашней табели о рангах ""девочкой из ЖЖ, которая лучше всех рассказывает о книгах"" - еще не любимым переводчиком (о ""Щегле"" на всех перекрестках кричала, что перевод гениален); не главным редактором Сторитела; не ведущей медузовского подкаста с Галиной Юзефович. И вот теперь ее перевод ""Маленького друга"" в формате аудиокниги, прочитанной любимым исполнителем.Уточню, на русский язык роман переведен дважды и недостатки первого по времени перевода Антонины Галль, буде такие есть, не помешали очароваться им. Но пе��вый по времени перевод много короче, словно из книги выброшены целые куски, даже понимаю, из каких мест, хотя не могу представить, по каким соображениям. Перевод фанатичной поклонницы ""Маленького друга"" Завозовой значительно объемнее и с ним от книги не возникает ощущения подвешенности мошкой в янтаре вне пространства и времени - четкая географическая привязка: Александрия, американский Юг; четкая временная - середина семидесятых.Помнится, в первый приход на LiveLib отзывов было на порядок меньше, и тогда девять из десяти рецензентов возмущались невозможностью определиться с местом-временем, словно эта дезориентация была им личным оскорблением. Сегодня полку читателей прибыло, массовость тяготеет к простоте, упреки примитивнее: отчего Донна Тартт так и не раскрыла, кто убил маленького Робина? Но книга не о том, как девочка мстит за убийство брата, и даже не о жизни сонного провинциального южного городка, хотя то и другое среди ее составляющих.А о чем тогда? Ну вот, хуже нет, когда на вопрос: ""О чем книга"", отвечают: ""О нашей жизни"". Но с этим романом лучше не скажешь. Нет, не оговорилась, именно о нашей, как она есть, и всякий найдет в нем свое. Трагедию, в момент разбивающую вдребезги жизнь семьи так, что после уж и не склеить, сколько бы времени ни прошло. Одинокое недолюбленное детство в окружении любезно-равнодушных взрослых, которое не может научить любви. Осознание собственного коренного отличия от большинства сверстников, нежелания идти проторенной кем-то дорогой с полным непониманием, а какая она тогда, твоя?Тяга вернуть потерянный золотой сон Юга-которого-на-самом-деле-не-было, аналог нашей ""России-которую-мы-потеряли"", только потеря здесь воспринимается в разы острее и горше, персонифицируясь в навеки оставшемся ребенком старшем брате, убитом в детстве. Понимаете, о чем я? Робин для Гарриет концентрированная мечта об Эдемском саде, где все любимы и счастливы, а фамильный особняк по-прежнему осиян люстрой из богемского стекла.Стремление найти и покарать убийцу брата превращается в род одержимости, священную рану, ритуальное действо, которое, кто знает, вдруг - да и вернет в полном объеме потерянный рай (нет-нет, не на осознанном уровне, такого рода маниакальные убежденности коренятся глубже). Это лишь один из смысловых пластов книги, которая вся, как немыслимо плотно упакованная в семь сотен страниц жизнь.Можно вычитать горькую социальную правду о невозможности для ""белой голытьбы"" вырваться из убожества своего слоя. Вы же понимаете. что Рэтклиффы в сути куда более талантливы и предприимчивы, чем Кливы-Дюфрены? Только вот, отпущенные на их долю возможности куда уже и специфичнее. Тем не менее, Фариш налаживает метамфетаминовое производство, Юджин пробует подвизаться как проповедник (с его-то внешностью), еще один брат, ныне отбывающий срок, заслужил спортивную стипендию на право обучения в колледже, от которой отказался.А можно серьезный разговор о расовой сегрегации, когда с черными слугами обращаются как с пылью под ногами и даже у любящей всем сердцем няню-домработницу Иду девочки не возникает сомнения, что именно жизнь в убогой хижине подобает этой женщине. Но и она, Ида, которая любит ведь (не может не любить) своих хозяек, не прощает ни черта, и чем это обернется для белых американцев завтра - как знать, никто ничего не гарантирует.Или мирная старость с одиночеством, которое не в тягость, когда есть скромная финансоваяобеспеченность и возможность провести пару часов в неделю в обществе таких же беззаботных старушек (вопиющее ведь противоречие всем стандартам, предписывающим растворяться во внуках, маяться от непонимания со стороны взрослых детей и страдать от одиночества!). А есть ведь еще тема недостоверной информации, на основании которой приходим к выводам, которые внутренне готовы сделать (ах, обмануть меня нетрудно, я сам обманываться рад).Он такой весь, этот роман, какую нить не тронь - на колебание отзовется множество других. Немыслимо подробные описания с глубочайшим погружением во внутреннюю и внешнюю жизнь персонажей, неважно - главных или второстепенных. Его невозможно свести к сюжетной схеме: ""убили-нашла-отомстила"" и неверно было бы счесть энциклопедией жизни американского Юга второй половины XX века. Или социальному роману, роману взросления, эскапистскому и авантюрному роману. Хотя при желании то и другое (и третье, и пятое, и десятое) вычленить можно.И именно с такой книгой полной мерой раскрывается исполнительский талант Игоря Князева, который хорош со всем, что читает, но, вы понимаете, когда материал так хорош и упоительно сложен - это ж другой уровень. Воочию видим резкую недобрую Гарриет, так похожую и так непохожую на красавицу-южанку бабушку Эдди; погруженного в психоделические рефлексии Дэнни; слащавого баптиста мистера Рэя, неистового параноика Фариша - всех вместе и каждого по отдельности. Становясь свидетелями чуда, когда шедевр встречает отличный перевод и превосходное исполнение."

Like TSH Tartt presents how a dark event becomes central in the lives of those involved. Harriet reminded me a lot of Briony Tallis from 'Atonement' with her clear intelligence yet obvious naivety and overconfidence at times. Don't read if you're looking for a clear cut Southern gothic whodunnit, but do read if you like multiple perspectives on lives affected by tragedy and the tense environment of old Southern society and etiquette."

So yes exactly like Tartt herself. With many similarities to Tartt's own early life (a childhood in Mississippi, raised mainly by her great aunts), it's impossible not to think of her through and through and for someone obsessed with the author, like myself, this was a treat through and through. Amen. But anybody diving into the book without a dysfunctional attachment to a woman they have never met, It might not be a five star book. I am not a person who sees why. Nonetheless, cheers."

246,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5914225-jane,Rating 3 out of 5,"The spunky girl child who does not conform to the world around her. Even before Scout Finch came along, she was a popular figure in children’s literature (Jo; Pippi; Anne; etc.) She is a widely beloved figure, and probably rightly so. Even though I never had much to do with Jo or Pippi or Anne, I love Scout Finch very much. (“Until I feared I would lose it, I never loved to read. One does not love breathing.”) And perhaps girls are especially in need of role models whose charm resides in their difference from those around them –the spunky heroine probably has the good taste not to drive around with a “Well-Behaved Women Rarely Make History” bumper sticker, as she’s busy being herself instead.The spunky girl at the center of this book, though, grated on me, and I think Tartt does masterful work in making Harriet both sympathetic and unlikable. Sympathetic, because her childhood does seem as dismal as anything Dickens could come up with; unlikable, because she is not a very good person. As a child, Harriet evinces a quality that I see often in adults: there are certain people who profess a great interest in social justice and are puzzling because they seem to hate everybody, not just oppressors but oppressed, except when the oppressed can be discussed in worried tones. I once overheard a very pregnant woman who had studied anthropology and professed to be greatly interested in cultures around the world say, “I just hope it isn’t a boy, because, well, you know,” and perhaps unfairly, whenever I encounter someone who works as a social worker or public interest lawyer who appears to hate everyone – an all-too-frequent occurrence – I think of her, because not only did she apparently have an issue with half of the world’s population, she also made her lack of interest in me and her dislike of her native U.S. clear (this latter because of how Americans are. I’m not sure what distinguished the other 300 million of us from her, precisely, but I’m sure it’s something very bad). This is something of a digression, because Harriet does not profess to like people, and she is admirable in certain ways. But bridling against racial injustice does little good if one has compassion only of an impersonal sort, and that only for the most abject victims of injustice. Tartt shows this nicely, especially in a wrenching scene where Harriet realizes how insensitively she has treated Ida, the housekeeper who has raised her and whom she loves deeply. Harriet has always been sensitive to the casual, generally unexamined racism of the people around her, and she has not been guilty of it, but she has been guilty in the way of self-regarding children who don’t understand the sacrifices and sensitivities of older people. She does the same to her own aunts, and at Sunday school she mocks her “prissy” classmates. This is where Tartt’s portrait is a little problematic. Harriet’s unwillingness to be like everybody else is a good thing insofar as moral courage is central to any fight against injustice, but her dismissal of everyone else around her and its attendant moral elitism is not the stuff of leadership. I think that Tartt handles most of this tension deftly, but Harriet’s conviction of her own superiority occasionally starts to smack of the “spunk for spunk’s sake” that bedevils too many would-be heroes and heroines who seem bratty instead.Tartt doesn’t suffer from undue admiration of spunk, though, even if at times she seems to lose control over the narrative voice and fall into cutesy admiration of Harriet’s “tomboy” qualities. (Not a term Tartt actually uses, to her credit – the term is my own cheap and gendered shorthand.) Her worldview is more complicated, in part because of the chilling portraits of the novel’s villains. At a meth lab outside of town, a wizened matriarch and her grandsons made me feel afraid in a way I hadn’t since a few frightening encounters with undersupervised children during my own kidhood: that feeling that you have no idea what horrors might emerge. The scene is terrifying without being a crude parody of what impoverishment and crime look like.There was much to like in this book, but I wish there had been just a little bit more plot resolution. Also, I was mildly confused by something that happened at the very end, if anyone’s willing to discuss offline I’d appreciate it!"

It kept my interest to the end as I just love the pictures that Donna Tartt can paint with her words, but this one isn't for everyone. I can see how some would find it a disappointment, but what wouldn't be when she busted out of the gates with The Secret History. This was a bit of a sophomore slump of a novel some some eyes, where she later redeemed herself when she wrote The Goldfinch afterwards. All that said, I did enjoy this, it's a story of childhood, tragedy, coping, and the seedy characters that sometimes pop up in small town lore. Harriet and her family are fascinating characters to follow around as they deal with loss, of Robin, of the maid, and of the more opulent existence of their family's past. All in all this is a good one if you see it for what it is. "

Wow. Much, much less enjoyable than the goldfinch or the secret history.

Harriet too is a fascinating character: half clever, precocious, bold & half naive, short-sighted, and selfish.

(They all are much loved after the fact, yes?) Some families come together and support each other after trauma, while some people turn inward, withdraw from others, abuse drugs, and dissociate. Grief can be difficult, especially with a child murder, and most of us do not support each other through it well.We were never meant to have him, darling. He wasn’t ours to keep. We were lucky he was with us for as long as he was. And this was the thought that came to Charlotte [Robin's mother], through a narcotic fog, that hot morning in the shuttered room. That what Libby had told her was the truth. And that, in some strange way or other, ever since he was just a baby, Robin had been trying to say goodbye to her all his life. (p. 10)Little Friend also considers our stories and Truth. We may believe our family's stories, but these stories are filtered through individuals with biases. (We all have biases.) Harriet, Little Friend's protagonist, recognizes that some of her family members are unreliable storytellers (or are just plain unreliable), but is drawn up short by others, whose biases are only uncovered too late.Little Friend reminds me both of Harriet the Spy and To Kill a Mockingbird. The central character of all three books was a smart, confident tween who was trying to make sense of a difficult and challenging world while coming of age. In both Little Friend and To Kill a Mockingbird the protagonist was dealing with classism, racism, and confusing violence in a world outside their ken. In all three books, the girl had a boy as a foil and, although attempting to handle problems well, fell on her face (mostly metaphorically) and had to attempt to learn from her mistakes. Harriet did not have a stable adult presence in her life, so often made decisions that were smart, overconfident, impulsive, and unwise, including committing a series of crimes that made sense from a 12-year-old's moral system: lying, breaking and entering, vandalism, theft, attempted murder. As in many books with young protagonists, most of the adults in Little Friend are, well, limited.This is a compelling storyline for bookish tweens, for whom Harriet the Spy is clearly written for, but it's also compelling for adults who are smart and capable, who assume they can see clearly, adults who are still attempting to make sense of their worlds and can empathize with Harriet's mistakes and recognize similar ones of their own. (Just to be clear, I have never attempted any of Harriet's crimes.)I liked the obsessive relationship between Harriet and Danny, the man she blamed for Robin's murder. They rarely talked and neither understood the other, but ""in a strange way (and it gave Harriet a chill to realize it) Danny Ratliff was the only person who’d really looked at her for a long time"" (p. 530).Little Friend is a very long book (600+ pages), but that gave Harriet time to explore the various parts of her universe and pull us in. Little Friend often left me a bit anxious – as several characters in this often dangerous world were frankly paranoid, but it pulled me in. I liked Little Friend's ambiguous ending but was a bit resentful when I came to its last page."

251,no user info,Rating 1 out of 5,I read this book a long time ago and found it to be overlong and boring. Nothing happened. 
252,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4636758-vanessa,Rating 2 out of 5,"2.5 stars.This took me SO LONG to read. It's not an exceptionally long book (555 pages), but the font is pretty small and the story itself is not fast-moving or particularly riveting.I loved The Secret History, and knew going into The Little Friend that it was her least loved book. I like to read author's works in order the best I can though, so I decided to pick up her second novel before finally getting to The Goldfinch. In hindsight, I think this was the best decision, because now I still have one of her most popular books waiting for me, and I didn't end my Tartt journey with this.The story follows 12 year old Harriet Dufresnes, who along with her friend Hely, decides to try and find out who murdered her brother Robin when she was a baby. What follows is frankly not a murder investigation as such, but more of a snapshot of one summer in Harriet's childhood. It reminded me at times of To Kill A Mockingbird - a book that has a particular subject, Tom Robinson's trial, at its center, but isn't actually really about that. This was almost a coming-of-age tale in a way, placed in a Southern Gothic setting.Harriet was a very well-rounded character - in fact, pretty much every character in this novel had their own distinct personality and characteristics, which I really appreciated. I love a book where the characters are well realised, and Tartt in my opinion does this incredibly well. However, my enjoyment of the book kind of stopped there. Although there were parts that did capture my attention (particularly the last chapter), I found that this novel was not what I thought it was going to be in terms of plot. I found myself feeling frustrated while reading, and felt that the book didn't have much of a point a lot of the time. The blurb on the back is definitely misleading, so I would advise that people go into the book knowing that.I wasn't wowed by Tartt's writing this time around, which is a shame as I thought The Secret History was incredibly well-written. I was advised to read her books in publication order to see the development of her writing abilities over time (there are long gaps between her books), but I felt this book was just nowhere near as accomplished as her debut.I'm glad I read it though, as it does take some persevering to do this. I am now excited to get to The Goldfinch, as I've heard nothing but good things about it. It's just a shame that this didn't live up to my albeit low expectations."
253,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13417219-emily,Rating 4 out of 5,"I'll preface this by saying that both of Donna Tartt's other novels were simply amazing and earned five stars from me. This one had more negative reviews so I was a little leery of it, but was determined to read it and see what I thought. At over 600 pages, this book is a commitment, and I thought it about 200 pages too long. I absolutely loved Harriett, the protagonist, who seemed to me a mix of Scout from To Kill a Mockingbird and Harriett the Spy, one of my very favorite childhood books. However, I could have done with much, much less of the Ratliff brothers. There was just far too much detail of their antics, and too many brothers, to the point that I kept mixing them up. I think I finally figured out who was who in the very last chapter! Same with Harriett's grandmother and her sisters...too many of them and too much unnecessary detail. And why did Harriett even have a sister? She added nothing to the story at all. Her father was also a strange, mostly absent character who could have been edited out with no loss to the story, in my opinion.I enjoyed Harriett and Hely's adventures most and read those sections with pleasure, but whenever I saw a long arc concerning the Ratliff brothers and their meth-fueled arguments and snake-filled scenes, I had to force myself to read on while rolling my eyes until I got back to Harriett's side of the story. But I persevered, and everything came together in the end, or did it? I was disappointed that the ending wasn't a bit more definitive -- or perhaps I am just dense. We never did get (or at least I didn't) a clear answer to the main question of the book. I won't say more so as not to spoil. The last chapter was exciting, though gory and tragic so was tough to get through, even though it was the most interesting of the book to me. Overall, this is a book you really have to stick with. Halfway through, I still wasn't sure I even liked it, but it did improve for me. 3.5 stars rounded up to 4 for Donna Tartt's excellent prose -- but I wish her editor had used a bit more red ink to shrink this book down by about a third. Still, I am glad I read it, even though it took awhile! "
254,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5366206-josh,Rating 4 out of 5,"Tartt’s second novel is clotted with death. Decay festers on every page. Loss clunks about the attic floorboards. Sorrow stacks up in newspaper piles moulding in the garage. I don’t think I have ever read a book that is so unified in theme, and motif toward examining hopelessness. Nevertheless The Little Friend is both beautiful and funny as well. Readers may be reminded of their freshman English class and the story The Scarlet Ibis, how the imagery of the swamp rises up to become a character all its own. So too in The Little Friend we see a deep love for Alexandria, Mississippi spun on the page. The rich imagery allows you to see the story with beautiful clarity, even in its horrors. The comedy of TLF shines through in the (better) character writing. Tartt shows that she is one of the best at writing children with Hely and Harriett. We enter their limited perspectives a number of times throughout the book and it is always at these moments when Tartt shines brightest. Hely’s character in particular is hilarious because he’s so smitten, so attention starved, and so brazenly amoral in the way only a child raised solely on action movies and Coca Cola can be. He’s the perfect accomplice and foil for Harriett, because to him everything is a game, this provides a darkly comic look at the very REAL SHIT that happens in the novel. There are loads of other positives to look at with TLF but it’s really a four star book. Some of the character writing is grotesquely one dimensional. Allison does nothing but cry. Charlotte is a vaporous nonpresence for 500 pages. Additionally, some of the subplots are resolvable in ways so simple that the story actually feels poor at times. There is one rather large scale problem that eats up a good portion of the middle third that could have been resolved if the entirely reasonable people involved had a five minute conversation. They don’t, it doesn’t, and the story suffers for it. Nevertheless, this one is a page turner. It’s well crafted and ultimately very satisfying to read. 4.25"
255,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24890050-claire-fullerton,Rating 5 out of 5,"I read The Secret History and The Goldfinch before I read this book. The first thought that came to mind when I finished it is there are those that write, and then there are those that tell the world how it's done by breaking the mold and creating from a space of their own devil-may-care, permissive making. Donna Tartt's writing is nonnegotiable; it's in a league of its own, so I'll simply stand in admiration of her deft skills and comment on what I see as her writer's personality, if you will, with regard to this book: Donna Tartt is a died-in-the-wool Southerner. It pours from the crevices of every paragraph in her literary accuracy of Southern language, nuance, priority, and characterization. I've read many a Southern writer ( and am a Southerner myself) yet can not think of anyone who delves down to the nitty-gritty in quite the same manner. It is more than her awareness of Southern parlance, what she handles adroitly is the underbelly of Southern mentality. In this book, she tap-dances on themes of denial, emotional isolation, class separation and self-righteous arrogance all through the vehicle of character. She writes through the lens of a vantage point with such a brutal glare as to make me wince, yet she is accurate. I didn't feel the warm, fuzzy comfort of beauty in this book, I felt an edgy cynicism instead and willingly accepted the tone. Tartt takes a simple premise: young Harriet Dufresne, of Alexandria, Mississippi, lives beneath the weight of the unresolved murder of her brother and seeks to find answers to a tragedy of which no one will address. That is the story in a nutshell, yet Tartt coaxes mile upon mile of humanistic fodder that goes beyond a painstaking, five-senses experience; her writing is so panoramic she holds the reader captive in describing a walk around the block. I take my hat off to Donna Tartt and will simplify by saying this: Donna Tartt is such a master storyteller, whatever she's selling, I'll buy."
256,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5166924-pat,Rating 5 out of 5,"Wow--where does one start with this powerful, complex novel??!!It is so very many things: a coming-of-age story, an examination of the nature of true evil, a chronicle of several dysfunctional families, racism, a mystery, and attack on Christian fundamentalism. The penultimate scene in the water tower was supremely gripping and it also has some very funny sequences.The unlikely hero is a 12-year-old, ill-socialized girl in a small Mississippi town. Harriett is a wonderful character, much more appealing than so many adult protagonists: fearless and sharp as a tack and dedicated. She stops at nothing to seek revenge on the man she thinks killed her brother 12 years earlier--with mixed results. In no way does Tartt sentimentalize childhood or demean her child characters--what a breath of fresh air! It's no accident that the protagonist is named Harriett, as in Harriett the spy, as Tartt's girl investigates the murder. Yet how much more engaging and fully realized is this Harriett! Her wrenching terror and grief at the departure of her beloved Ida Rew--the only stable element in her life--humanizes Harriett.Tartt's lesser characters are equally engaging, especially Edie, Ida, Hely and the Ratliffs.Tartt is a Southerner and truly understands its culture. The dialogue is spot-on, be the characters fallen blueblood old ladies, the ""colored"" help or desperate druggies. The language is so compelling, from descriptions of nature and weather to a druggie's DTs to the subtleties of human interaction. Tartt is a marvelous wordsmith and dispassionate observer of humanity in all of its complexity; I enjoyed this much more than ""A Secret History."" "

At 555 pages, you need to be a bit of a stoic to get through this dense yet absorbing and at times very gripping novel. It is a story about mourning a loved one and the consequences this can have on an entire family and community. Harriet is a twelve-year-old girl at the start of the story and she clearly has had to deal with the untimely and mysterious death of her brother on her own. He died when she was just a baby, so no memories link her to him, other than a few tales told by her grandmother and photos. She still feels the loss herself through her mother's depressed and medicated silence, the absence of her father and the realization that no one can tell her why her brother was killed or why they are not able to move on as a family. 'But though Harriet was forbidden to confide her own sorrow, her mother's sorrow was a constant reproach, and Harriet felt vaguely responsible for it. Sometimes - at night, especially - it waxed palpable, like a mist, permeating the entire house.' I could sense the claustrophobic atmosphere throughout the narrative and the sadness of a child who'd not only been abandoned and neglected but left to feel guilty. Yet, all she is doing is her best to grow up on her own. If you are looking for an unusual read taking you on a journey to a small Mississippi town with an unusual character at its centre, this could be for you!"

The story jumped around and I was never really sure what was going on or who the characters really were. Meaning that the characters were never really fully developed. It may be that I listened to the audiobook and maybe if I had read the actual book I would have felt differently but I was really disappointed in this book. I waited in a long wait list at my library so that added to my expectations but the in actuality, in my humble opinion, the book was a waste of time. The description on the back of the book made it seem like there would be some great mystery with Harriet, Robin's little sister, looking for his murderer after so many years of hiding and not speaking of the day of his death. But it all fell flat for me. I just can't say how disappointed I am in this book. However, I must stress that I listened to the audiobook and again that may have had some affect on the story. My advice is if you are going to attempt this book, maybe try reading the actual book. It may come off better than the audio version because the audio version absolutely was a disaster. 1 star."

Donna Tartt deftly creates believable characters, in particular the compelling 12-year-old protagonist, Harriett, who demonstrates shades of Scout Finch and possibly shades of young Tartt, herself. I love this book: the language, the authenticity. Donna Tartt is one of my favorite authors, and I forget that she is a Southerner by birth because of her other two books, The Secret History and The Goldfinch, decidedly Northern, East Coast books. But as a Southerner myself, this book feels real, like maybe it’s the book she always wanted to write and had to have success first to write. I highly recommend this book for fans of character-driven novels, and small town or Southern literature that's decidedly not ""sweet,"" like the work of Flannery O’Connor. Tartt is sharp and incisive in her critique of Southern culture and small town life, but also kind in the fact that people are complicated and not always one thing or another. This is a book that needs to be read now. I took my time reading this book, savoring it. It was my immersive summer read. Highly recommend, and like The Secret History, I'll be reading this again."

Totally, right?Well, that's just fine because it's all non-linear and when there's so many characters and almost no description, you figure it's not really your job to keep track of them all.But Tartty realism is rich in detail and you really need to know who everyone is. And if you blank out on the wrong page, as I often do, you get lost and stop caring, as I did. I forget characters all the time! But then I just figure if they're important it'll get repeated who they are or you can work it out from context.My bad, Donna!"

It was evocative in a 1970s-era Southern gothic way and really made you as the reader feel like you were living in this small Mississippi town along with the characters, however, it was so slow-moving as to almost be called boring. It's character-driven the first 75% of the book, and the last 25%, the plot finally kicks in, but at that point, it's almost too late. Tartt frustratingly never resolves the central mystery of the book and ends not on a cliff-hanger (the book is too lethargic for that), but on a note that leaves many dumb questions unanswered. Though this review is mediocre, I didn't HATE this book, but I probably would not recommend it.

Also, I'm typically OK with some ambiguity and indeterminacy, but if the central mystery isn't resolved in any way in the span of 600+ pages, that's kind of a problem for me.

288,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/136973544-marykk,Rating 4 out of 5,"With this book, I think it’s fully possible that I’ve read something else than all the other people who are shitting on it. Or maybe we’ve read the same book after all, but there was this massive thing ruining everything else that I’ve missed. Possibly Donna Tartt has manipulated me again - possibly I don’t know how qualified writing looks after all.That being said, I kind of don’t understand all the hate this book is receiving? For me, it was clear from the very first passages that this would not end up being a mystery who-done-it, and I think that it definitely has been marketed in a wrong way to you if that is your exception. Throughout the novel, the theme of Robins murder is only addressed constantly in the beginning and while you read, it gets obvious that we are not getting a clear answer to this question. More recurring topics are Harriets relationships with her family (her sister, her mother, her grandmother and aunts, hely), the injustices in 1970s america society, poorness, class differences, growing up / loss of innocence and religion. Beside that, Donna has proved that she is a literary genius again because all of these things are intervined cleverly into a beautiful web of very picturesque small town american summer desribtions from different perspectives. Like, I still can imagine alexandria in my head. Reading about the history of the cleve family, I got fairly intrigued as their backstory seemed very realistic and believable. Some people might have found this boring because there was a lot of explanation about the different family members. But for me, it was interesting enough to keep reading. And yes, there were some passages that seemed fairly boring and irrelevant, especially in the chapters from hely’s perspective. Oh well, I did not like him, that little spoiled annoying brat. you can come at me. Beside the cleves, there were also the poor families of alexandria whose members got a few pov chapters. I especially loved reading danny’s chapters because he was such an interesting character, one of my favourites beside Allison.In my opinion, it is a far better book than the Goldfinch, where the author tried too hard to show off her excellent writing skills and it ended up with very long pointless passages, endless descriptions and inconsistent characters. The little friend offered us far less of these paragraphs; an explanation for this might be the fact that the timespan of its plot is far shorter, like 3-4 months, whereas the Goldfinch illustrated events from more than ten years. However, the little friends style seemed far more structured, as if she had a bigger goal in mind while writing. I appreciated the ending because it shows how Harriet has grown up throughout this summer as she realizes that Danny wasn't to blame for her brothers dead and that she should stop being so invested in pointless revenge. This ending might have appeared unsatisfying for some readers who expected a thrilling mystery novel, but not for me, so it's a thing of personal preference.Obviously I wouldn't call this book flawless, as there are many issues that should not be overlooked, like the usage of racist undertone. For example, the only black characters with importance were both housekeepers and really poor, like the author seemed very keen to mention that. They also spoke with a heavy accent as the words within their speech were written differently than those spoken by white people. It might be a thing of accurate representation here as American small towns in the 1970s often didn't have many non-white citizens, especially in the conservative south, but she could have at least addressed / challenged these stereotypes. It reminded me of the weird thing with the hispanic housemen in the Goldfinch, which was definitely more problematic as the setting is more modern and she should have known better. So, if you're really sensitive to this kind of topics and discussions, I wouldn't recommend the book to you.Overall, I think you can say that the little friend has definitely captivated me in some kind of way that I didn't really expect!! It might be the same to you, but it might also bore you to death if you don't vibe with the characters. You might as well try it, as the book isn't as long as the secret history or the Goldfinch, so you won't waste that much time."

Sin mucho que hacer con sus vacaciones, Harriet se inscribe en un concurso de lectura de la biblioteca, piensa en ir a nadar todos los días, y aclarar la muerte de su hermano, con esta premisa recorremos cientos de páginas a través de las calles del pueblo de Alexandria, Mississippi donde parece que todo transcurre igual e invariable si no fuera por las tragedias y las muertes.El gran obstáculo con el que se topa Harriet para su investigación es que nadie habla sobre la muerte de Robin, su madre es un espectro que solo duerme y acumula cosas, su hermana no recuerda o no quiere recordar nada sobre ese día, y se la pasa durmiendo la mayor parte del tiempo, los otros adultos a su alrededor no quieren hablar con ella de ese asunto.Pasan cosas en el libro, muchas cosas que tienen que ver con otro clan totalmente distinto, esos llamados basura blanca, viven en los límites del pueblo en unos remolques viejos, la abuela gum y 4 nietos, son todo lo que queda, imbuidos en una inercia de miseria, violencia, drogas.Estos dos mundos colisionan por el azar y sólo dejan esquirlas en el terreno, aunque todo lo que se cuenta importa, uno llega al final del libro con más preguntas que respuestas, no existen conclusiones, pareciera que la historia sigue viva y a nosotros los lectores sólo nos corrieron el velo y ya no podemos ver qué pasa, y creo que esa es la mayor falencia del libro, no sabemos qué ocurre con los personajes, todos quedan en ese mismo limbo en el que vivían desde que inicia la historia.Aunque mi balance es negativo, puedo ver en la narración que estoy frente a una escritora llena de recursos e imaginación aunque en este caso no haya llegado a buen puerto, en algún momento intentaré con otro de sus libros.La anécdota 📚📖⏱La escritora publica cada 10 años, El secreto 1992, Un juego de niños en 2002, y El jilguero en 2013.Pros 🕵️‍♀️🤓🔝✔️ La forma de narrar es objetiva presenta los hechos tal cual ocurren, presenta los personajes tal cual son, es decir confía en la inteligencia de su lector para analizar lo que lee; imaginación a chorros; una premisa delirante que daría para un libro policial.Contras ❌‼️😵‍💫 Debido a que presenta un misterio puede leerse con las expectativas incorrectas, los personajes no evolucionan parecen muertos en vida, el final se da abruptamente sin ningún cierre.Lo que no me creí 🧐😏😩🤯 Harriet tiene 12 años y aunque es fuerte no me parece para nada posible que salga invicta de tantas cosas, también me hizo dudar mucho la cantidad de cosas que pasan por azar, son demasiadas.La peor escena 🎬 Harriet sube con muchas dificultades a una torre con un depósito de agua 💦, se tarda horrores y uno sufre con ella, después de una escena donde se pone a prueba su resistencia física arriba de esa torre, en la siguiente línea Harriet ya va rumbo a su casa 🏠, ¿como bajo la torre en esas condiciones, nah, nah, nah,El peor personaje 🧑🏻‍🦰 Por mucho Charlotte la madre es el peor personaje, entiendo que perdió un hijo y eso la sumiera en depresión, pero han pasado 12 años y ni siquiera es capaz de lavar un vaso, mirar el estado de sus hijas, pero si es capaz de despedir a la criada que lleva muchos años cuidando a sus hijas y manteniendo la casa limpia, solo porque una de las hijas se atreve a pedirle de cenar a Charlotte."

And I had to say ""no."" The reason is two-fold; the reviews aren't great, but then there is the original AWFUL cover with the doll face - who let that fly? So when I stumbled upon this Bloomsbury Classic edition and saw the water tower, I pieced together that this is a SOUTHERN novel.And it is in every sense...there are bigger than life bizarre characters, family lore and legend passed on by stories that meander and go round and round. And in true southern fashion, Tartt tells us more about how rooms look and food smells and heat felt than there is actual plot. But that is Southern storytelling!•This book can be summed up in the sentence ""It's not what you say, but how you say it."" And there is a plot - Harriet Dufresnes is a young girl living in Alexandria, Mississippi in the shadow of her baby brother's murder twelve years ago. Harriet is whip smart (think Scout in To Kill a Mockingbird, who I have to believe she is modeled after). Robin's unsolved murder tortures Harriet and she sets out to solve it. But the unfolding is as ""slow as molasses running uphill in the summertime!"" So if that's not your cup of sweet tea, I'd pass on this. But if you love gorgeous, descriptive writing, unique characters and a southern setting, (oh, and snakes - lots and lots of snakes) here is one of the best American writers with her nod to Faulkner, Lee, and a few other of my favorites."
291,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36633855-wutheringhheights,Rating 3 out of 5,"Terminata la lettura di  Il piccolo amico  ho sentimenti contrastanti.Da una parte mi piace molto come scrive Donna Tartt. Le sue doti narrative sono innegabili. Si prova una soddisfazione particolare nel leggere i suoi personaggi tanto ben costruiti, così ricchi di sfumature e capace di ribaltare la situazione. Dall'altra parte sono rimasta abbastanza insoddisfatta. Ma quanto incidono le aspettative, su una lettura? Io ne avevo molte. Gli altri due romanzi di D. Tartt mi avevano soddisfatto appieno. Soprattutto  Dio di illusioni  indimenticabile e amato.Mi aspettavo di trovare una conclusione netta e, anche se non sono lettrice di gialli, e quindi non abituata a desiderare la scoperta del colpevole, in questo caso la volevo.D. Tartt ha scritto un romanzo sulle illusioni. E anche un romanzo sulla solitudine e la perdita - tanti tipi di perdita. La protagonista, Harriet, è una ragazza che si scopre, pagina dopo pagina, affondare dentro una amarissima solitudine. E' la solitudine di chi sta crescendo? Non solo. Benché sia circondata da una famiglia numerosa, nessuno la sente. Nessuno le concede l'attenzione di cui ha veramente bisogno. E ad un certo punto è come se si trasformasse in carnefice di se stessa, oltre che del sospetto omicida del fratello.Infatti il libro si apre con un fatto sconcertante: il piccolo Robin viene trovato morto, appeso ad un albero. La famiglia ne esce devastata e Harriet, parecchi anni dopo, inizia a covare una oscura ossessione nei confronti della verità. Ma è la sola verità che effettivamente vuole? Magari la sua crociata senza alcuna prova reale è un modo per sfogare la sua sofferenza. In tutto il romanzo nessuno mai se ne renderà conto, eccetto una volta quando una delle sue zie dirà:  E' brutto essere bambini, perché si viene costretti dalle decisioni altrui.  "
292,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/157374011-nathan,Rating 2 out of 5,"Onestamente sono rimasto piuttosto deluso da questo romanzo.Non fraintendetemi, amo la scrittura di Donna Tartt e il suo modo di esprimersi, ma mi tocca ammettere che “il piccolo amico” è un libro inconcludente e privo di una trama effettiva.Accadono troppe cose contemporaneamente, ma allo stesso tempo non succede nulla di importante e che abbia un impatto sul filone narrativo. Trovo inoltre che Harriet sia un personaggio poco realistico; stento a credere che una ragazzina di 12 anni, per quanto intelligente e dal carattere particolare, possa spingersi a tanto. Ciò che mi ha lasciato più con l’amaro in bocca è stato il finale. Non credo di poterlo neanche definire tale. Ho continuato la lettura per lo stile della scrittrice (che ripeto, adoro) ma soprattutto per la curiosità di scoprire l’assassino di Robin. Deludente quindi sorbirsi quasi 700 pagine di inutili e infinite descrizioni per poi non giungere mai a un punto di arrivo. Mi sarei accontentato addirittura di una conclusione prevedibile e poco originale. Detto questo, la mia valutazione è di due stelle perché sebbene le mie aspettative fossero nettamente più alte non è stata una lettura spiacevole."

So meticulous.I loved Harriet's greataunts and the descriptions of their homes; always a pleasure to get a little paragraph on them.All in all a very well crafted story.

Her story-telling and writing abilities have such an emotional impact on me, I can’t help but cry reading all over her books.

That was The Secret History, which has been on my to-read list for ages and almost every pissed off review I've seen of The Little Friend talks about how shit TLF is compared to The Secret History. The Little Friend is definitely a bit shit, but in a way I'm glad to know that since I've started at the bottom, the only way to go now is up.*Spoilery synopsis*The story is essentially about a 12 y/o girl called Harriet whose 9 y/o brother Robin was murdered when she was only a baby. The murderer was never caught or even identified and her family and surrounding relatives are all understandably a bit messed up by it even many years later. Harriet decides she wants to figure out who killed Robin. So she does, or more like she just decides that X is shady and mean and also knew her brother as a kid, so X definitely did it. And then she decides to kill X as punishment, including a convoluted plan involving sitting on an overpass and chucking a rattlesnake down into the sunroof of a passing car. Which doesn't go quite to plan but Harriet is ruthlessly determined and eventually manages to fuck up X's life, only to consider that mayyybe X didn’t actually kill Robin. But since X is also a violent drug dealing redneck the story ends on a very ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ note.*end of spoilers*And if that doesn't seem interesting then haha oh boy would you be disappointed if you'd just read through 555 pages to discover that. But on the other hand if you do think that sounds interesting you're still probably going to be disappointed because the book spends a lot more time exploring the setting and the many, many forgettable side characters than it does furthering the plot.I'm being hard on it but I actually didn’t hate The Little Friend! It was strangely readable given how flawed it was. I finished it in two days, barely able to put it down, when normally it takes me a month to finish a book half its size. And this is after I'd already learned that the big mystery teased at the beginning never actually gets solved, which I'm not going to spoiler-warn because people should definitely not go into this book with the expectation of any kind of satisfying resolution.The book's main strength is Harriet, who is a huge, huge asshole but also weirdly sympathetic and loveable. That said there was also something annoyingly precocious about her that made her seem like a total author-insert, and funnily enough, when I got to the author portrait at the back of the book I noticed that Donna Tartt looks eerily similar to Harriet's description: dark bob, sharp looking, humourless. And then I discovered that Tartt was born in Mississippi, the same setting as The Little Friend. I don't know how much else of the story comes from Tartt's experiences, but the long, frequent detours in the narrative to talk about southern life shit that didn't add anything to the story besides overstuffing it suddenly made a LOT more sense.And that's my main complaint about the book: it feels like 70% waffle, 30% of which is still interesting or prettily worded, evocative waffle, while the rest is flat out skippable. It comes off as pretty self-indulgent, actually. Worse when I came to realise somewhere along the 2/3 mark that every scene I'd read so far could be taken out and rearranged into a different order and it wouldn't have had any impact on the narrative. That's how slow and waffly it is.Going back to Mississippi for a moment, I guess I should also note that this book is set in the seventies and there's a lot of awkward racial stuff going on with side characters that seemed like it was trying to be commentary, but I'm realising now went absolutely nowhere. There's something pretty galling about having to read the word 'nigger' over and over for what ultimately was just there to create the backdrop for a story about a 70's Mississippi white girl - who had a black maid she totes loved like family! It wasn't even relevant to the story's evolvement in the end. It wasn't relevant to Harriet's development as a character either, which is pretty bizarre given that her maid, Ida, getting fired for covertly racist reasons is treated like this big injustice by Harriet and you think it's going to lead somewhere in the story, but instead it just fades out of relevance. So that's pretty bullshit.Overall I think the book is too flawed to safely recommend to anyone. I'm not even sure how I of all people managed to get through it. But I'm glad to take away a few shining bits of the story - Harriet being barely tolerated by the adults around her, Harriet being trapped at camp like she's Wednesday in Addam's Family Values, Allison - the sister so completely different to Harriet, the aunts and their hilariously accurate social dynamics.

But all that around the center that we were promised in the first chapter.So I spent the whole book trying to figure out what it was about, and maybe that distracted me.Definitely below her other 2 novels (as seems to be the consensus). But her writing is still unparalleled.EDIT: I'm adjusting to 4 stars, because it's somewhere in-between 3 and 4 and I feel bad about giving it a lowly 3 when there wasn't anything that I didn't like or enjoy about the book. It was just the comparison to what I hoped it would be (and what her other books were) that made it fall flat."

That's genius at work. This is the hardest form of writing today and we do not see it enough. It's challenging. But Tartt pulled it off.Also, this book is about several things, the most important is death. And that itself is another challenging element. I think Tartt is obsessed with death as most southern writers are, this is what she cannot escape. One sees it in all her work. As one does the coming of age storyline. She's a Romantic with a big R. She is not a postmodern writer. She is looking at life head on and asking questions, exploring ideas. She is really not concerned with just one character in these stories but many and how they related to one another. And how they relate to larger issues. Dying. Murder. And even how some of these things are never really resolved to satisfaction.I am from the South. Although I've read comments to the contrary, Tartt grew up in the Greenwood-Grenada area. They are not far apart. She later went to Ole Miss and then transferred to Bennington and now lives in Virginia. She's very private. When I look at writers from the South, I see similarities in how they handle the public. Laughing. Tartt is very close to her mother, but her father, no way. He was the distant one. She did not really come from this class of family. She was not from what they call Old Money. And her story is not about that. It's about the harsh realities of a child facing a crazy adult world that she inherited. I think Tartt probably felt that growing up in that area. I grew up in Greenville which was a different town and I went to Catholic schools so I was protected from some of what she experienced. But I had relatives in Greenwood. My grandmother lived in Moorhead. And so that was the same experience she knew. She nailed it. 1970s too. I feel for her.In this story, Harriet, the lead, is obsessed with her brother's death, a possible murder. Of course, it's a murder and one that will remain unresolved. Harriet is dealing with some harsh psychological issues. And while Tartt never names them or even allows the reader much time to reflect, those troubles exist. Neglectful parents, confusing relatives, religion, an obsession with death and dying, this is a child in an unsafe world with an assortment of defense mechanisms at play. But Harriet is managing as most children do. The poorer, uneducated, hungry ones do not thrive. In the end, Danny is arrested for murder though not the murder of her brother. And look at his family. All these children in a world of predicament that they cannot escape and how they survive into adulthood is the challenge. Especially with their psychology healthy. Most descend into pathology.I haven't read many novels this year. But I love this novel. I am sure to reread. And it affected me. (I cried.) Children are not the creators of their tragedies. They do not make them. That is the work of adults. All the children in this book have suffered at the hands of the adults who gave them life and cared for them. Of course, they were once children. I suppose some cycles are hard to break. What do you think?"
326,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/128060728-hailey,Rating 5 out of 5,"The top Goodreads review for The Little Friend is “the only thing keeping this novel together is the binding”, with a rating of one star. The airhead who wrote that and the other 934 invalids who liked the review need to go touch a single goddamn blade of grass. If I’m riding for one person in this world, it’s my black-bobbed, petit, chain-smoking, dark academic genius of an author AKA “Mother” AKA Donna Tartt. And The Little Friend is no exception. No crumbs were left on the premises. I would read about every single hum-drum day of Harriet’s life for the REST of her life if Donna Tartt blessed the world with such a publication. Readers, don’t be afraid to dig a little deeper when experiencing the art of the written word. Not every book you read is going to hand you the obvious answers. And the next time you come for Donna, and I say I’m gonna beat your ass, tell you’re lawyer it’s a promise!! Not a threat!!"
327,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46500065-jennifer,Rating 4 out of 5,"So. I have a lot of things to say, but first I really cannot stop myself from commenting on the primary criticism I've seen of this book, which is that it promises to be a murder mystery and cheats you by being unresolved/not being that much about the mystery. I found that criticism to be very perplexing. If that's not your thing totally understandable but I feel like it's pretty clear from page one that it's not that kind of book? Take the epigraph for example:“The slenderest knowledge that may be obtained of the highest things is more desirable than the most certain knowledge obtained of lesser things. — St. Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologica I”I just don't really get people feeling misled but maybe that's just me. In any case, I personally did not go in expecting a clear resolution, was not surprised by the lack of one, and have no real complaints about the meandering, contemplative nature of the text.HOWEVER. That is not to say that I don't have complaints. I agree that this is Donna Tartt’s least strong novel, but I think that has less to do with construction and more to do with the fact that her difficulty in writing about race, hinted at in her other work, is on full display here. This is a book that at its core is about trauma and neglect and the cycle of abuse within this community and we see those issues drawn out in complex and compelling ways in the individual lives of many of the characters… until we get to the characters that aren’t white, and then suddenly we have caricatures and only the occasional nuance. I think the failure to dig deeper into both the way these issues impact the black characters and the way these issues intersect with racism is a failure to fully explore all the facets of this community and I think the story is poorer for it. I acknowledge that she does raise some of these topics, but she does so at a surface level, and in a book that’s over 500 pages and that contains very little plot, I expect more.With all that said, Donna Tartt still manages to create some incredibly evocative images, honestly I can’t bring myself to care if she even has a point sometimes, everything she writes is just such an experience. Rounding up to 4 stars from what is maybe closer to a 3.5 star experience because of the quality of the writing and also because, as previously noted, I take umbrage with the reasoning behind some of the extremely low reviews of this book and feel compelled to balance them out."
328,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20694805-gl-ucia-renata,Rating 4 out of 5,"Segundo romance da premiada autora estadunidense, o livro nos conta a história de Harriet Dufresnes uma menina de 12 anos do sul dos EUA que resolve descobrir a identidade do assassino de seu irmão Robin, morto aos 9 anos quando ela era bebê, crime nunca esclarecido.Esse livro parece dividir opiniões e acredito que o maior problema seja a forma como a sinopse é apresentada, nos fazendo achar que se trata de um livro meio policial, cujo maior objetivo é desvendar um mistério. Assim como em A História Secreta, Tartt nos envereda por caminhos tortuosos e o livro parece (policial) mas não é.A família de Harriet é composta por uma mãe que parece não mais viver no mundo real, vive presa ao passado em que seu filho preferido foi morto, Allison, a irmã apática, a autoritária avó Edie e algumas tias meio amalucadas. A menina luta para resgatar um mundo próspero e feliz que nunca conheceu, em contraste com seu melancólico e sombrio lar. Essa busca colocará a menina com um mundo adulto onde reina a violência.Gostei muito do livro mas poderia ter sido menos extenso, muitas passagens são irrelevantes e não fazem diferença na compreensão da história.Em minha opinião a personagem mais importante é a que quase não aparece: Charlotte, a mãe de Harriet, pois é a responsável por tudo que a menina se sente impelida a resgatarHistórico de leitura85% (503 de 592)""Por incrível que pareça ( e Harriet sentiu que se arrepiava toda ao pensar nisto), Danny Ratliff fora a única pessoa que realmente olhara para ela em muito tempo."" 84% (497 de 592)""- Quando eu era menina, - Gum disse, avançando com dificuldade - meu pai disse que um sujeito capaz de sentar numa cadeira para ler um livro não presta."" 45% (266 de 592)""Edie disse que aqueles mórmons pareciam ser bons rapazes, mas que acreditavam num monte de besteiras."" 9% (52 de 592)""Harriet queria capar do mundo que conhecia e mergulhar naquela luminosidade azulada e clara onde seu irmão estava vivo e a linda mansão ainda existia e todos eram felizes.""2% (11 de 592)""Durante o resto da vida Charlotte Cleve sentiria culpa pela morte do filho, pois decidira comemorar o Dia das Mães com um jantar às seis da tarde no lugar do almoço de meio-dia depois da igreja, como os Cleve costumavam fazer.""

329,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/88950688-vicki-antipodean-bookclub,Rating 4 out of 5,"“It’s awful being a child,” she said, simply, “at the mercy of other people.”...When Harriet Cleve was a baby, her older brother Robin was found dead in the garden, lost in the moments between running out to play and being called back in for dinner. Robin’s death sends his family into a tailspin, accelerating their decline from old Mississippi money to middle-class suburban life in a small town. When Harriet turns twelve, she decides to investigate Robin’s death. Surrounded by medicated or disinterested family, she is free to roam around in the stultifying heat of a Mississippi summer operating on the half-truths and platitudes given to a child who is brighter and more determined than anyone realises. Anyone, that is, except her best friend, Hely, who has worshipped her ever since he can rememberExploring the town with Harriet, we are exposed to the poverty, family violence and drug abuse that permeate the streets around her family home. A reality that threatens the boundaries of the middle-class life that the Cleve family has staked out for itself. There is racism here, both insidious and overt. When great-aunt Libby dies, the family fails to even tell her friend and housekeeper Odean. Libby’s sisters had never approved of this friendship between a Black and a White woman that had grown over the course of fifty-five years. The passage where Odean comes to Libby’s funeral utterly enraged meThere is a recurring motif of snakes throughout the book. One character notes that “the creeping serpent” cannot be separated from the rest of creation with snakes being as much God’s creature as the “little lamb.” I wonder if this is a comment about who we perceive as valuable and worthy of love in our society. Perhaps we create our own serpents? Certainly the intergenerational cycle of poverty and abuse led to the behaviours of many of the characters in The Little FriendThis was a buddy read. We both felt that the middle third of the book was a little “stodgier” with the pace and intrigue picking up again towards the end. The Secret History remains my favourite of Tartt’s novels so far, but this shares the same wonderful compelling writing with a great balance of character and plot."
