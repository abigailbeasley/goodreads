Cal feels like he ought to stand on a street corner handing out warnings, little pieces of paper that just say: Anyone could do anything.
Goodreads tells me I was reading this latest Tana French book for twelve days, though I'd say a good ten of those days was getting through just the first hundred pages. The Searcher was another slow-starter from French, in my opinion. Neither this book nor The Witch Elm have grabbed me as fully as her Dublin Murder Squad books always did.That being said, once I did make it past those first hundred pages and finally settled into the rhythm of this story, I began to really enjoy it. Cal was far more interesting to me than Toby from her previous book. I also really liked the dynamic between the two main characters in The Searcher - Cal and Trey - and would liken it to a couple of other book relationships I've enjoyed, but it would be a bit of a spoiler to do so. The Twelve Lives of Samuel Hawley is one that comes to mind.French returns to what I feel she does best with this book: grit and grime. The Searcher takes place out in rural Ireland, an isolated place of farms and local folk who've known each other's nasty business for decades. Hands get dirty, animals get killed, skinned, and eaten, not necessarily in that order. Into this wilderness comes an American ex-cop looking to settle down for a peaceful life.Instead, Cal gets caught up in the disappearance of a local boy. Soon he is finding out that the idyllic place he imagined, the place of ""no handguns, no copperheads or cottonmouths or rattlesnakes, no bobcats or bears or coyotes, no black widows, not even a mosquito"" actually might be hiding all kinds of untold dangers. The comradeship and camaraderie between locals, which he so admired initially, begins to take on a threatening hue.French hits on a couple of current issues, too, weaving them in subtly. Police shootings feature, as does a critique of social media morality. In other words, the kind where people yell over one another to compete to be seen as the most moral, or ""woke"", but of course French doesn't use that word. I think, in the end, French really wanted to experiment by placing a stranger in the Irish setting she's by now so familiar with. She takes this Chicago cop who's used to having guns, pals on the force, and a back-up team at his disposal, and she strips all his resources and defenses away. Puts him in a strange land and lets him feel it out for himself. It's got the crime-solving excitement of the DMS books, but with an additional obstacle to overcome.I'm still waiting for another Dublin Murder Squad book, but this wasn't half-bad."
1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16912659-dorie---cats-books,Rating 3 out of 5,"***NOW AVAILABLE***It pains me to give a Tana French novel 3 stars, this was one of my most anticipated reads of 2020. I loved the Dublin murder mysteries and even the slow burn of The Witch Elm, but this one just didn’t do it for me. A 3 from me doesn't mean it's a bad book, just not one that I loved!In looking back I realize that she does write male voices often but I think the choice of a retired ex-cop from Chicago perhaps just didn’t ring true to me. I live in Wisconsin but visit Chicago frequently and it’s certainly a far cry from the Irish countryside. I did like this explanation of why he retired, in part “I got weary, Cal said, bone weary.” He did. Every morning got to be like waking up with the flu, knowing he had to trek up a mountain”. So Cal decided to move to a remote town in western Ireland, why he picked this location exactly is never explained. Perhaps he thought it was just far enough that the badness wouldn’t be found here. Of course he’s proven terribly wrong because there are bad guys and good guys everywhere. He purchases a dilapidated house and starts to work on it from the inside out. It isn’t long before his solitary life is invaded and he is pulled back into the investigative life he left behind.We do meet some interesting characters here, one of which is Mart, Cal‘s neighbor. Surprisingly he seems to accept Cal, introduces him to lots of the neighbors at the local pub. He’s a more complicated character than we are at first lead to believe, but I pretty much had that figured out. Always watch out for the nice guys!My favorite character was 13-year-old Trey, a child wise beyond 13 years considering what Trey has had to live with. Trey's father ran off and the mother is left with a handful of children to raise with little to no funds. Trey has no support system whatsoever. The child doesn’t attend school because Trey's mother is too exhausted to care. When brother Brendan disappears, Trey is beyond upset, is certain he would never leave, that something terrible has happened to him. After getting to know Cal in a roundabout way Trey finally asks him for his help. Although he claims to have retired he can’t seem to leave the matter alone, which gets him in a whole lot of trouble. With his father-like feelings for Trey I had to like Cal more than a little, even though I wanted to shout things at him periodically!!Not much happened in this book until about the 80% point on my Kindle, it’s a long time to wait and I grew weary. It’s at this point that what is going on around here is uncovered, unfortunately it was quite predictable, given all the red herrings uncovered.I was really hoping for a wow ending that would pull this up to at least a four star, unfortunately that didn’t happen. I strive for honesty in all of my reviews and it gives me no joy to report that this Tana French novel left me very disappointed. I would love to see her go back to female characters, like Antoinnette the awesome inspector from the Dublin murders series. I will still follow this author because one disappointing novel doesn’t take away from the great novels she has previously written. It also hits at a bad time in our nation right now when reading a slow burn, depressing novel is hard to reconcile.Go into this one blind or read a variety of reviews, there are lots of reviewers who enjoyed this one more than I did.I received an ARC of this novel from the publisher through Edelweiss."
2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/124132123-lisa-of-troy,Rating 1 out of 5,"The slowest mystery that I have ever read.Cal Hooper is a retired police officer who finds himself in Ireland, fixing up a rather old house on a small spot of land. One day, he is minding his own business, living the simple life that he has always wanted, when a young boy stops over at his house. The boy wants Cal’s help with finding out what happened to his brother who has gone missing. When the police don’t care about your problems, who can you turn to? Apparently, Cal Hooper.The Searcher is set in modern-day Ireland, a setting that I love. Aside from the setting, I also enjoyed that the women were not depicted as boy crazed. However, this book is slow, painfully slow. I started listening at 1.5X speed and ended up at 2X speed. Every time, I tried to read The Searcher, I dreaded it.Most of the book is Cal fixing his house, descriptions of hunting (even very gruesome details), and a lot of people that don’t know anything. Rooks, the birds (not the chess pieces), were mentioned 40 times! There is so much filler in this book that the editor should cut at least 70% of the book. There just is not enough action.This is a book where the character loves to talk about every single possibility, every possible path. Usually, I enjoy hearing the character’s thoughts, but in this case, it is overly done. When there finally is a reveal, the author stretches it out so much. In my opinion, the author overly explains events. Most of Cal’s background information arrives in the last half of the book. This is just too late. By the time that his background is finally, finally revealed, I just did not care anymore.In conclusion, The Searcher is a solid pass from me. There are too many books to read for a pace this slow.2024 Reading Schedule	Jan	MiddlemarchFeb	The Grapes of WrathMar	Oliver TwistApr	Madame BovaryMay	A Clockwork OrangeJun	PossessionJul	The Folk of the Faraway Tree CollectionAug	Crime and PunishmentSep	Heart of DarknessOct	Moby-DickNov	Far From the Madding CrowdDec	A Tale of Two CitiesConnect With Me!Blog Twitter BookTube Facebook Insta"
3,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53701594-nilufer-ozmekik,Rating 4 out of 5,"Another outstanding, moving example of Tana French’s epic writing! With her remarkable skills she can create intense, realistic, dark, raw, rash portray of rural western Irish and let you have a memorable, breathtaking, journey!This small town is the real protagonist of the story. As you start your reading, you learn to listen its own people’s struggles, sadness, demanding, hard life choices and accept the dynamics between the relationships. The town was like living, breathing, functioning organism with its own rules and patterns. Everything starts with retired detective Cal Hooper’s moving to the small remote Irish who buys an old wreckage, dilapidated house by giving higher bid to beat a local man. Of course town’s people are reluctant to accept an outsider into their lives or welcome him with open arms. The loner ex detective accepts his faith and focus on rebuilding his new nest, feeling someone’s scrutinizing eyes over him: Trey, a local boy watches him behind prying eyes, coming from dysfunctional family. He needs urgent help of Cal to find his missing brother.Cal cannot find the peace in his new place and he reluctantly accepts to help the boy even though it means attracting more hostile threats of town’s people because he was about to open so many cans of worms and disturb the town’s people’s peaceful lives. The depictions and detailed composition of rural Ireland was captivating. The pacing and creative storytelling were satisfying as always. The characters were not easy to empathize with but throughout your reading you get used to their rough parts of their characteristics and accept them as they are. I’m giving four dark, mysterious, pastoral, impressive, meticulous depiction stars! It is always pleasure to read French’s books. Special thanks to NetGalley and Penguin Group/ Viking for sharing this remarkable ARC with me in exchange my honest opinions.bloginstagramfacebooktwitter"

“I got weary,” Cal says. “Bone-weary.” He did. Every morning got to be like waking up with the flu, knowing he had to trek miles up a mountain.”
Unhurried. Measured and unhurried are the first words that came to my mind when I was thinking how to describe Tana French’s newest book, The Searcher. Not slow - although I’m sure you’ll hear that - but precisely and deliberately unhurried.I am not a huge fan of describing books in terms of other books or other authors, but I can’t think of a better comparison here. It reminded me of Stephen King at his best (or his best according to my opinion, for all it may be worth) - not the spooky stuff but those interludes when his regular Joe characters are settling in the rhythms of a small town, feeling out the place, before the shit hits the metaphorical fan, before things go wrong - but with enough foreshadowing that the fragile idyll is going to be over soon and bad things will come. 
This is the mood and the tone here. It’s set in rural Ireland, a tiny insular rural community where more and more places are being abandoned by the youth in search of opportunities. Cal Hooper, a retired Chicago cop coming to terms with life change after his divorce, moves to this tiny place in search of calm and quiet, hoping for peace. But the peace is too fragile to last.
“One of the things that had caught his attention, when he first started looking into Ireland, was the lack of dangers: no handguns, no snakes, no bears or coyotes, no black widows, not even a mosquito. Cal feels like he’s spent most of his life dealing with feral creatures, one way or another, and he liked the thought of passing his retirement without having to take any of them into account. It seemed to him that Irish people were likely to be at ease with the world in ways they didn’t even notice. Now that rifle feels like something it would be good to have in the house, the sooner the better.”
Cal plans to restore the dilapidated old farmhouse he bought. He works at it, and takes walks, goes fishing, and enjoys the countryside, and is feeling out his new neighbors who started forming tentative friendships with him and are starting to accept him into the fold. He’s content - but he feels like this cannot last, like something is waiting to happen, and so do the readers. And yes, his new peaceful life gets a bit upturned when a local almost feral kid from a good-for-nothing family tried to enlist Cal to help find that kid’s missing older brother. And suddenly the close-knit community is starting to feel suffocating and shoulder-to-shoulder against the stranger who is about to dig up some metaphorical skeletons from their resting places. Very quickly the reassuring things can become menacing.
“Their decades of familiarity, which seemed like a comfort at the beginning of last night, weave themselves into an impenetrable thicket; its layers obscure every action and every motivation till they’re near indecipherable to an outsider.”
 
This is very different from French’s much lauded Dublin Murder Squad books. In pace - much slower. In tone - more wistful and contemplative and subdued. In the mechanics of narration - unlike all her prior books, this one abandons the intimacy of the first person narration. In the setup - as a former cop, Cal is unable to conduct the usual police-style interviews, leaving him with the need to figure out things in a more subtle approach. And in the spirit of the story - this one is not really so much about solving a crime as it is about Cal himself and things that he will and will not do, about his own moral code and how far it can be pushed. Morals versus manners, as Cal would explain.
 “Cal has had enough of being discreet. He figures it’s time to kick a few bushes and see what scuttles out.”
It’s not a crime thriller, and if you go in expecting one you may end up sorely disappointed. It’s more of a literary novel by a writer who is known for psychological f*ckeries masquerading as crime novels. What happened to poor unfortunate Brendan Reddy is really not the point. What happens to the heart and soul of Cal Hooper and the community itself is the point. How the desired outcome is approached is what’s interesting - is the point getting what you should want or what you need? What do you view as justice - the punishment or the resolution? What is the goal of searching for answers? 
Ultimately it’s 400+ pages of unhurried and measured character study - and the locale itself is one of the most important characters here. It’s atmospheric, it’s well-written and well-plotted, and shows that French can do very well outside the setting and style of her Dublin Murder Squad novels. It’s captivating and nuanced, and that pub-moonshine-subtle warning scene is done so well that I read it three times in a row for sheer enjoyment of seeing a writer excel at her craft. And yes, there are a few issues tacked on too strong, too artificially likely to make this book feel more “current”, but they are easy to overlook.Don’t go into this novel expecting more of Dublin Murder Squad feel or your usual crime novel. It’s neither of those, and in this it is interesting and special. Prepare for the unhurried walks down Irish countryside while pondering morals, not manners - and before you know, French has done her magic again, differently this time but very much worth it.4+ stars."
5,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30978160-meredith-trying-to-catch-up,Rating 4 out of 5,"“The dark is busy around here.”The Searcher  is a character-driven mystery about a former cop whose quest to find peace in a small Irish town leads him into danger. Cal Hooper, a 48-year-old former cop from Chicago, moves to a small village in Ireland to start over. Struggling to come to terms with the demise of the marriage and end of his career, Cal throws himself into repairing his ramshackle cottage. His days are fairly prosaic until 13-year-old Trey shows up with a mystery for Cal to solve, the disappearance of Trey’s 19-year-old Brendan. To humor Trey, Cal begins to investigate Brendan’s disappearance. He uncovers a dark web in his new tiny town, which threatens to destroy all Cal has worked to build.This is a slow burn, atmospheric read.  Cal’s cottage, the woods, and the village all play significant roles in the story. Cal’s relationship with nature and his new surroundings is tied to the events of the book, which I found intriguing. However, there is a hunting scene involving a rabbit that I could have lived without.  This was my second Hurricane Zeta book, and the creepy undertones of the townspeople and the woods were enhanced by the storm and power outage. The narrative is told entirely from Cal’s point of view. I wasn’t sure about French writing an American character, but she pulled it off (there were a few times that had me shaking my head, as Cal’s voice felt forced,) but in the end, his character worked for me. The Searcher is slow, subtle, and different from other Tana French novels (in a good way). The mystery is more of a back burner, but it becomes a driving force towards the end. Really, this is about Cal coming to terms with loss and accepting his new life. I liked Cal, but Trey’s character was my favorite. Their friendship, while unexpected, works to hold this book together. There are a few surprises thrown in that I didn’t see coming, as I was so wrapped up in Cal’s head. The tension slowly builds, fueled by the atmosphere, leading to a tautly written, if somewhat anticlimactic conclusion.Overall, this was a surprisingly good read (after The Witch Elm  my expectations were low). I can imagine some readers will get frustrated with the pacing, especially in the beginning, but don’t give up--it’s worth the read! "

Listening to Mart, Cal has started to get an inkling of how tangled up things get around here, and how carefully you have to watch where you put your feet. Noreen, who runs the shop in the brief double line of buildings that count as Ardnakelty village, won't order the cookies Mart likes because of a complicated saga that took place in the 1980s and involved her uncles, Mart's father and grazing rights; Mart doesn't speak to an unpronounceable farmer on the other side of the mountains because the guy bought a pup that was sired by Mart's dog when it somehow shouldn't have been. There are other stories like that...he's gathered enough to know that he could have sat on someone's stool in the pub, or cut across the wrong piece of land on one of his walks, and that that could mean something. mart is a respected figure in the town, and once cal wins his approval, mart becomes his virgil, taking him to the pub and introducing him to the locals, whose low-key mistrust of outsiders holds an especial antipathy towards americans; one rooted in broad stereotypes and their dealings with the previous tenant of cal's place. under mart's wing, cal's natural affability and cop-honed ability to read a room and adapt to his surroundings, playing up the 'hapless american' act and taking his cues from those around him, eventually wins him the town's grudging acceptance. it isn’t until cal meets 12-year-old trey; a local kid whose beloved older brother brendan has gone missing, and reluctantly agrees to look into the matter, that the dangers larger than dog and sheep disputes begin to appear. on the surface, there's no great mystery to a nineteen-year-old leaving a town that people—especially young people, have been leaving to seek better opportunities for quite some time, but as cal begins to poke around and make inquiries, the reticence and deflections he encounters seem to be more than just the typical ""none of your business"" attitude a small town constructs against outsiders, and their scrutiny of his pursuit becomes more palpable, pointed. All of a sudden he has that sensation he kept getting...an intense awareness of the spread of the dark countryside all around his house; a sense of being surrounded by a vast invisible web, where one wrong touch could shake things so far distant he hasn't even spotted them.french paints cal into a tricky corner, layering the complications of his 'fish out of water' status with his being a cop with no authority. he has the skills to subtly investigate a missing persons case; years of interrogation have fine-tuned his ability to read people and mask his intentions in casual conversations, and he's certainly able to track down witnesses, follow clues, and gather evidence, but with no gun, no badge, no backup, out of his element in a whole new world of unspoken rules and subtext, he's in an extremely vulnerable position.cal is such a great character—he has a defined personal code and moral compass, but he doesn't have a hero-complex. he's respectful of how things work in his new surroundings, careful not to impose his ideals where they're not wanted, turning a blind eye to shadiness he would not have been able to ignore if he were back home. he's driven by a need to fix things—restoring the house and furniture, solving problems, teaching trey practical skills, but he's not looking to fix the way his adopted home handles its business. the relationships in this book are sheer perfection. cal and trey's scenes together are so damn good, and the arc of their relationship; cal's gruff mentorship, trey's naked hunger for a male role model, and the strain certain revelations bring to their relationship are all rich and worthwhile and it never falls into easy sentimentality. my favorite teachable moment: cal’s taxonomical lesson to trey about the difference between manners, morals, and etiquette is suitable for framing. although it takes up far less room on the page, cal’s strained relationship with his adult daughter alyssa; their awkward phone conversations where it's clear that they're both trying to have a better relationship, but there's so much unspoken between them; carrying the weight of unhealed disappointments, his failure to understand her—it’s achingly, complexly real.cal and mart are another excellent pair—there’s a real friendship blossoming there, but there's always a glint of some dangerous edge beneath mart's surface folksiness; their mutual withholding becoming a primal instinct, like animals circling each other. such potent, gritty stuff. this is, like The Witch Elm, another stylistic/generic departure for tana french—but at the core of it lie the same strengths: she has a bone-deep understanding of what makes people tick, she's a measured and deliberate storyteller, and she always takes the less-travelled ethical road in terms of what is right, morally, and what is right, legally, avoiding clichéd answers about what constitutes justice or closure. it may not be a procedural, but her novels have always been very character-driven, and these standalones have given her more room to explore her themes and i am all for it. if she wants to write a romance novel next, i'll damn well read a romance novel. ********************************review to come, but good lord.*********************************tana french is writing her take on a western??YAYYYYYYYYYY!!!please please please gimmie!!!!come to my blog!"
7,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38610813-paromjit,Rating 4 out of 5,"Tana French's latest slow burn of a standalone novel is rather different fare from her usual, set in a fictional West Ireland small town, Ardnakelty, a place where the reality bears little resemblance to the idyllic rural community where nothing much happens. American Cal Hooper is a burned out and disillusioned man, retiring from Chicago PD after seeing too many of the problematic issues that readers will be familiar with, given the contemporary focus on American policing and the continuing protests in the United States. With a daughter, but divorced from his wife, he decides to shift in another direction, to try and forge a life that brings him some measure of peace and which involves him moving to Ireland, buying a run down home that will require him to spend considerable time engaged in its renovations.Cal appreciates the natural environment, and we are given in depth details of his work doing up his home, conversing with a neighbour, Mart, holding back from jumping into too hasty social interactions with people, preferring to observe instead. However, he finds himself drawn back into utilising his investigating skills, when a 13 year old youngster from a poor background, Trey, watches him closely, aware of his background in policing. Trey wants Cal to find out what happened to his brother, Brendan, who disappeared a little while ago, and the local police have shown little interest in looking into this. A tenacious and determined Cal searches for the truth, not put off in the slightest by the obstacles that litter his path. This is not my favourite Tana French novel, but I still enjoyed the character driven mystery, particularly the strong evolving bond between Cal and Trey as they work together. The narrative brings out the nature of small town living, including the claustrophobic feel of it, providing the backgrounds of a range of different characters. The slow moving storytelling means this will require patience from some readers to get the most from it. A complex tale of mystery, secrets, friendships, morality and ethics, relationships, of being a man, justice and the natural environment. Many thanks to Penguin UK for an ARC."
8,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5463364-david-putnam,Rating 3 out of 5,"Three stars, this one wasn’t really my kind of book too slow of a burn. The conflict (story arc, 4c’s conflict, complication, crisis conclusion) wasn’t set until page 78. The business of establishing character, setting and what the story is going to be about took too long. There was a lot of painting rooms in the house and details about rehabbing an old desk. Some other authors do the same thing, delay setting the conflict, but they also add in micro conflicts that pick up the story on their back and carry the prose along to the first dynamic scene where it lights off. Those micro conflicts were not present here. Once the conflict is set here there are only smatterings of kick-starting the main plot and it doesn’t really engage until after page 100. Yikes.The character is well-drawn and three dimensional but for me there just wasn’t enough going on. So, this book gets an “Eh.” It’s all a matter of preference though. I like to be dropped into the “Fictive dream,” and I just couldn’t get it going here."

10,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33853154-melissa-bantering-books,Rating 4 out of 5,"Be sure to visit Bantering Books to read all my latest reviews.Review first published by Mystery and Suspense Magazine on 11/29/20.Tana French is so good.For me, she’s a bit like Stephen King. By this, I mean – she can write on and on (and on and on) about the minutest, most mundane details of everyday life, and I lap it all up. Time and again. Every page of it, regardless of the subject matter.She could write an entire chapter describing the tranquility of drying paint, and I would devotedly hang on her every word. She could write about nothing, and it would leave me begging for more.Consistently, French’s crime novels are better than most, if not always excellent, and her latest standalone, The Searcher, is no exception. Even though it may somewhat pale in comparison to her Dublin Murder Squad series and not be my favorite of her novels, it is still, in its own right, an immersive, compelling, and superbly-written literary mystery.Looking for a fresh start, Cal Hooper leaves the city life behind to move to small-town Ireland. Recently divorced and newly retired from the Chicago police force, he purchases a derelict house in the Irish countryside, determined to peacefully spend his days renovating his new home.Until a local kid, Trey Reddy, comes calling, asking for his help. Trey’s brother, Brendan, has gone missing, and Trey is desperate to find him. Not wanting to be part of an investigation, Cal first refuses to become involved. But thanks to Trey’s unorthodox powers of persuasion, Cal’s resolve slowly crumbles. Soon, Cal and Trey have trouble coming at them from all sides as they find themselves trapped in a dangerous web of secrets and lies.The Searcher is one of those novels that sneaks up on you. It crawls under your skin, digs into your bones, and slowly consumes every inch of you.While reading it, I was aware that I was enjoying it. And I knew that for too long, I had sorely missed the depth of French’s writing. But it’s almost as if I didn’t fully comprehend how engrossed I was in the story. It was only when I put the book down and walked away from it that I realized how constant of a presence Trey and Cal were in my mind, how relentlessly the story lingered in my thoughts.Instinct and years of reading experience, however, indicate that my love for The Searcher will not be shared by all. Those who enjoy mysteries with quick tempos and nonstop twists may find it to be lacking the excitement they crave. For the novel slowly burns at a low flame, with a deliberately steady tempo. The story is never hurried. It’s never rushed. And the pace never quickens, with the ending even being slow to unfold, straight through to the final page.As with all of French’s novels, The Searcher is also fueled foremostly by its characters, rather than the plot. Therefore, I think some readers may find the novel to be tedious. I, for one, adore character-driven stories. And for what it’s worth, I believe French writes some of the best. Her meticulous characterization skills are revered far and wide. She is so practiced at it that, for her, it’s virtually a science. It’s as if her characters leap from the page, they feel that alive.And she doesn’t only do this with her major characters, such as Cal and Trey. She gives her minor characters the same treatment. Cal’s neighbors and the various townspeople are just as brilliantly crafted, with uniquely individual personalities.In this novel, too, the landscape is larger than life. The mountains, plains, and bogs of the Irish countryside are all richly described and carefully constructed on the page. French puts forth as much effort into creating the atmosphere and setting as she does her characters.The mystery of Brendan’s disappearance, though, is where the novel slightly stutters. The who, what, where, and why of it are fairly transparent. Furthermore, it’s tough to believe that Cal, a seasoned detective from Chicago, fails to immediately see all that is before him. Especially when I can effortlessly link the puzzle pieces together from my reading chair.In the end, the obvious solution to the what happened and the whodunit did not in any way dilute my pleasurable reading experience. The Searcher is, hands down, one of the best mysteries I have read all year. If not, the best.And once again, I am left begging for more.

11,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/260116-janb,Rating 5 out of 5,"Cal, newly divorced and retired from the Chicago PD, moves to a remote village in Ireland looking for a quiet, peaceful life, a place that couldn’t be more different than Chicago. He’s life-weary and his relationship with his ex-wife and adult daughter is troubled. As he renovates his dilapidated cottage he uses the isolation and physical labor as a way to heal. But there’s no privacy in a small village, and, in fact, Cal misses human interaction. He begins to meet his neighbors at the local watering hole and also befriends a local boy, Trey, who is from the wrong side of the tracks and has a secret of his own. It’s a friendship that benefits both, and it was wonderful and heartwarming to watch their friendship blossom as Trey helps with the work on his house, and Cal teaches him new skills. Cal is a true Renaissance man with many skills but those skills are tempered with compassion and goodness. Trey has a rough home life and a beloved brother, Brendan, who has disappeared without a trace. Trey knows Cal is a retired PO and begs Cal to help locate him. As with most small towns, secrets run deep and as Cal begins to uncover them, he receives subtle threats that eventually become not-so-subtle. Unsettling things begin to happen in the community and the good ‘ole boy camaraderie in the local pub has an undercurrent that makes Cal wary. The growing sense of tension and unease that eventually explodes is the type of subtle suspense I love in literary fiction. I enjoy the Dublin Murder Squad series but this was a terrific, well-written, atmospheric standalone. Few authors can write this type of suspense as well as Tana French. I particularly love the type of slow burn where I’m privy to the daily routines and the private thoughts and feelings of the MC. I loved everything about this story: the setting, the colorful characters, and the growing tension. I often look for meaning in a book’s title and in this case it’s very fitting. Does Cal find what he’s searching for? I won’t say, but I loved the ending and found it to be perfect and satisfying. •	This was a buddy read with Marialyce and we both found it a pleasure to immerse ourselves in such brilliant writing and character development.•	For our duo review please visit https://yayareadslotsofbooks.wordpres..."
12,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4514828-susanne,Rating 4 out of 5,"“The Searcher”: A novel you feel in deep recesses of your bones, kind of like changes in the weather. “The Searcher” is a character driven novel, first and foremost. The characters are brilliantly plotted, and written to absolute perfection. They are rich, dynamic, difficult and stubborn. Having undergone life’s trials and tribulations, they are strong, resilient and unrelenting. Some are good, kind and hard working, others not so much. In this novel, the characters are what drew me into the story immediately. This novel is a slow burn wherein the story builds and builds. Then there are the gorgeous descriptions of the vivid landscape, the weather (yes, the weather), home remodeling, and of course, the characters, always the characters. Let’s not forget the element of suspense and the unofficial investigation that ensues involving two unforgettable characters and the relationship that evolves between them.Cal Hooper is a former Detective with the Chicago PD who moves to Ardnakelty, a small town in West Ireland to start over. His plans from here on out are to fix up his new home, fish, hunt, rest and relax. When thirteen year old Trey begins terrorizing his homestead, Cal realizes that Trey has an ulterior motive. Several months ago, Trey’s older brother Brendan went missing and no one in the village has done anything about it. Now that Cal has arrived in town, Trey wants Cal's help in finding out what happened.Cal is driven, hard working, funny, kind, intuitive and smart. Trey is assertive, attentive, inquisitive, scared, sweet, poverty-stricken and wise. More than anything, Trey wants to find his brother and he knows that Cal is his best bet. At first, Cal agrees to investigate, simply because Trey won’t let up and then it becomes clear that there may in fact be something to Trey’s story. The camaraderie that develops between the two is sheer brilliance. Cal becomes a friend, and perhaps a father figure to Trey and it is the relationship between them that makes this novel wholly special.The investigation into what happened to Trey’s brother, while a huge part of this story, took second place for me. The armchair detective in me realized at the outset what happened to Brendan and who was responsible, though it in no way took away from my enjoyment of this book. I loved the characterizations, the development of all of the characters’ relationships and the investigation that took place. I felt every ounce of this story and I savored it. In short, I adored “The Searcher” for exactly what it was: a character driven plot which included a suspenseful storyline.  Tana French is a prolific author and remains one of my favorites. I love her writing style and I am a huge fan of her characters. Someday, I would love to see her return to the Dublin Murder series and the characters of a) Rob Ryan (I need to see what has happened to his character after all of this time!) and b) Stephen Moran (who I still have a huge crush on (even though I’m twice his age)). For those of you who love brilliantly plotted character driven suspense novels, read Tana French, I promise you will be rewarded.Published on Goodreads on 10.25.20."
13,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4125660-liz,Rating 4 out of 5,"I had seen all the reviews that warned this one was a slow start. Yes, it does take a while for the story to gear up. And if you’re looking for something fast paced, this isn’t it. But to be honest, I liked Cal Hooper so much, I was happy to just spend time with him. And it never felt like it dragged, just that it moseyed more than jogged. It’s a story meant to be savored, not gulped. Cal has retired from his time as a Chicago detective to a fixer up in the Irish countryside. There, he meets a young boy distraught over the disappearance of his older brother. The Garda aren’t interested, so Cal starts doing his own research. French totally captures the small town feel, the shared history, the busy bodies, the way people blow hot and cold if they don’t like what you’re doing. There are some wonderful characters, not just the two main ones. But Trey will break your heart. In fact, this story tugged on my heartstrings in a way that most mysteries don’t even attempt. I found I was looking for reasons to listen to just one more chapter. The narrator, Roger Clark sounded exactly like I expected Cal to sound. He did a superb job. "
14,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17295672-jaidee,Rating 3 out of 5,"3 ""darkly beautiful but highly flawed"" stars !!The 2022 Most Average of Average Award Boyo boyo does Tana French have some lovely writing chops on her ! Friends on GR and IRL have been urging me to read this author for years and I am finally glad to have made her acquaintance. What I loved and admired: 1. Her detailed, interesting and colorful descriptions of both weather and landscape. They serve as not only poetic fodder but deepen the dark and mysterious atmosphere of rural Ireland. 2. The dialogue and interpersonal relationships were mostly bang on and full of a vivid realness that slowly reveal themselves on the darkness that lays partially revealed under pub nights, Irish folk songs and playful banter between men that have grown up in the area with all the tribal rules and regulations. Both of these points were at least 4 star excellent if not 4.5. This is very good fiction writing although not literary as many people feel.What minor qualms I had 1. This book took way too long to draw me into the story. I would say to myself over the first quarter of the book...com' on and git crackin Tana ! The troublesome bits 1. I found the psychology of the main players a combination of cliche superficial stock characters that we find in any American crime drama albeit most of them had an Irish brogue. This was incredibly disappointing to me with the high calibre of Ms. French's atmospheric and elegant prose. 2. Number 1 led to characters behaving in ways that did not seem realistic to this reader but rather for overly dramatic effect and at times cheap sentimentalism (that I must admit brought a green Irish tear or two to my eyes) All in all this was a mixed bag of shamrocks for me. I know though that Ms. French is able to definitely able to create four leaf clovers that perhaps were lost in this particular stand alone drama mystery. "
15,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30817744-sandysbookaday,Rating 4 out of 5,"EXCERPT: He's halfway through his second pint before he tunes into the argument going on down the bar. It catches his ear because it sounds unusual. Mostly the arguments in here are the well-worn kind that can be made to stretch for years or decades, resurfacing periodically when there's nothing fresh to discuss. They involve farming methods, the relative uselessness of local and national politicians, whether the wall on the western side of the Strokestown road should be replaced by fencing, and whether Tommy Moynihan's fancy conservatory is a nice touch of modern glamour or an example of jumped-up notions. Everyone already knows everyone's stance on the issues - except Mart's, since he tends to switch sides regularly to keep things interesting - and is eager for Cal's input to mix the conversation up a little. This argument has a different ring to it, louder and messier, like it's one they haven't practiced. 'There's no dog could do that,' the guy at the end of the bar is saying stubbornly. He's little and round, with a little round head perched on top, and he tends to wind up on the wrong end of jokes; generally he seems okay with this, but this time he's turning red in the face with vehemence and outrage. 'Did you even look at them cuts? It wasn't teeth that done that.'ABOUT: THE SEARCHER - Cal Hooper thought a fixer-upper in a remote Irish village would be the perfect escape. After twenty-five years in the Chicago police force, and a bruising divorce, he just wants to build a new life in a pretty spot with a good pub where nothing much happens.But then a local kid comes looking for his help. His brother has gone missing, and no one, least of all the police, seems to care. Cal wants nothing to do with any kind of investigation, but somehow he can't make himself walk away.Soon Cal will discover that even in the most idyllic small town, secrets lie hidden, people aren't always what they seem, and trouble can come calling at his door.MY THOUGHTS:For some unknown reason, I haven't read anything by Tana French for several years. But I am glad I decided to resume our relationship with The Searcher, very much a character driven mystery. Her characters are 'characters': from Cal, fresh out of Chicago who came looking for a small place, a small town in a small country, settling on Ireland because at least he wouldn't have to learn a new language; to Noreen who runs the shop in the brief double line of buildings that counts as Ardnakelty village, and who won't order the cookies Mart likes because of a complicated saga that took place in the 1980s and involved her uncles and Mart's father and grazing rights. The townsfolk are insular, almost feudal. They will look out for and protect one another, even punish one another, but are slow to accept change or new people into their midst. The 'bush telegraph' is alive and well in Ardnakelty. At one point, Cal concedes that 'a guy can't pick his nose around here without the whole town telling him to wash his hands.' The pub, Sean Og's, is the social centre of village life, along with Noreen's store, where you will be served a healthy slice of gossip along with your grocery order. Unless, of course, you're on the outer, in which case all you will get is misdirection and obfuscation at best; at worst, stony silence and a withering stare. Or, a warning. The beauty of The Searcher lies in its characters, who come very much alive with French's skilful depiction. There are many laugh out loud moments, but also moments of deep emotional complexity. This was a slow read, in the context that I took my time and lingered over passages, enjoying the depth of the characters and the complexity of their thought processes. This is not a thriller. The Searcher is an atmospheric mystery underpinned with a lurking menace. It is a portrait of a small village determined to protect itself. It is an immensely satisfying read. ⭐⭐⭐⭐.4#TheSearcher #NetGalley THE AUTHOR: Tana French, born 1973 in Burlington, Vermont, is an American-Irish writer and theatrical actress.

16,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10171516-jessica,Rating 3 out of 5,"this reminded me a lot of jane harpers books - the setting and the characters totally steal the show, the setting specifically. it honestly felt like i was in a small village in the irish countryside where everyone knows each other and their business. its an immersive narrative that i havent experienced from TFs storytelling before, so it was a nice surprise. and its a good thing that those aspects were such quality because i found the plot, especially the ending, to be so anti-climatic. i dont think ive ever read a book where the mystery turns out to be a complete accident, and let me tell you what. what a disappointment. i understand that it is a definite conclusion (it answers all the questions), but its the kind of conclusion that makes following an investigation for 450 pages feel not worth it? i dont know how to describe it. overall, there are some really great things about this book, especially if you enjoy connecting to characters and their environment - its a new side to TF that i honestly really liked seeing - but i just cant get over how let down i am by the ending. ↠ 3.5 stars"
17,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56111743-roman-clodia,Rating 2 out of 5,"Wait, wait, just 2 stars for *Tana French*? One of my all-time favourite authors who has never got below 4 stars from picky me? Well, I'm sorry fellow French fans but this one just left me flummoxed...Writing, unusually, in the 3rd person, this has an unconvincing central character in Cal who is a retired Chicago police detective who is a bit burned out, disillusioned (his partner shot an unarmed Black boy in a timely incident), and still mourning his broken-down marriage who chooses to buy a shack in the middle of nowhere in Ireland, a shack without even running water which he's planning to do up. Now, given the insular nature of the small agricultural community, the fact that young people leave as there's nothing to do unless they inherit the family farm, we'd expect this American stranger to struggle with the locals but no: he's welcomed in the little community, the local shopkeeper is match-making within seconds and, once Cal gets his teeth into the disappearance of a young man, people are happy to talk to him and uncover their secrets. None of this rang true to me at all. And it's s-l-o-o-o-w. Now, I was one of the people who *loved* The Wych Elm so I don't mind slow if it's slow and purposeful - but this gives us page after page of sanding down drawer runners and teaching a young boy how to shoot rabbits and details of what Cal is eating and what cookies (do Irish people use 'cookies' for biscuits?') his neighbour likes...The thing about French that I love is that she gives us a gripping mystery but also uses the form to explore wider themes: trauma, identity, love appear again and again, treated with originality and integrity and a humane empathy. I couldn't find anything much beneath the surface story of this book. Maybe I was missing something? So it's with a heavy heart that I'm rating this as just 2 stars: I found it ponderous and unconvincing and found myself skimming restlessly as Cal starts working on his drawer runner again... Thanks to the publisher for an ARC via NetGalley"
18,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24770184-sandy,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5 starsThere are a handful of authors on my “No-Brainer” list. Their books are the ones I automatically reach for.…don’t need to see the cover, read the synopsis or check any reviews. Just gimme. That doesn’t mean all of their books were 5 star reads. You always enjoy some more than others but something about their writing style and/or characters keeps me coming back. Ms. French is one of those authors & this book is no exception. All her books contain an element of crime but some are driven by suspense while others focus on the characters. This story is more about how the characters are affected by a crime than the crime itself. Cal Hooper is a man who doesn’t mess around when he decides he needs a change. In short order he retired from the Chicago P.D., got divorced & bought a cottage in rural Ireland sight unseen. Yep, it’s a handyman special but he now has nothing but time. Let the renovations begin. At first Cal’s solitude is only broken by visits from Mart, his elderly cookie-scarfing neighbour. But he soon senses another presence. It turns out to be 13 year old Trey Reddy, a shy kid who’s heard about this odd American. And he wants to hire him. Trey’s brother Brendan disappeared a while back & no one seems to care. Not the local cops, not even his worn out mother. Trey figures it’s because he’s a Reddy….a name synonymous with the Irish equivalent of trailer trash. Cal came here to leave his old life behind. He’s lost his inner compass, that thing that made him trust his own judgement. In its place is self-doubt & uncertainty as to who he is now & where he belongs. You get the sense he & the old cottage have a lot in common. Both need someone to peel away layers, repair what’s broken & build them back up. Cal chose his new home based on location. As an outsider in a rural area, he thought he’d have the physical & emotional space he needs. Now he’s buying cookies for a nosy neighbour while dodging the local matchmaker. Trey shows up most days to help with the renos. The kid’s quiet desperation finally gets to him & Cal agrees to look into Brendan’s disappearance. Oh man, be careful what you wish for.So….a wee heads-up for all you French fans. Don’t go into this expecting a tense, suspenseful read akin to the Dublin Murder Squad books. It’s more like her last book, a slow burn type of story with fully realized characters & atmospheric prose. Yes, there is crime but it’s almost incidental. What you have is a beautifully written narrative that is completely character driven. It’s moody, descriptive & some scenes hurt my heart. As I read I couldn’t help but think of Shane, the classic western. A solitary stranger arrives in town & is approached by a poor kid up against locals intent on maintaining the status quo. All the ingredients are there, delivered in Irish vernacular. Just don’t expect any white hats.So maybe leave your preconceptions at the door. The depiction of setting & language is spot on & you’ll soon find yourself surrounded by misty rains & 40 shades of green. It’s a quiet, well written character study that deals with themes that will resonate no matter where you call home."

21,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s,Rating 4 out of 5,"Very different from her other books and the first not set in Dublin. Instead it is set in a small Irish Village, a village of farmers, fishermen and people who have lived there for quite some time. Cal, our narrator, is a Chicago cop who has left that vocation. He is a divorced father of a grown daughter, whom he misses dearly. He has come to Ireland, this village, to find peace and a place where he can be pretty much left alone. He bought an old, dilapidated, long abandoned house which he is repairing, fixing some furniture left by previous owners. It is while engaged with this work that he meets Trey, a young teenager who will eventually ask him to find a missing, older brother.Although there is a missing boy, this is not really a mystery, or not only a mystery. It is very slowly paced, a measured sloshed that allows the reader the opportunity to totally know the characters and their environment. To notice the details, the setting, and the feelings that live within. The slowness also serves as a way to ratchet up the tension, the insidiousness that grows as more in uncovered, discovered. There is violence, but not more than is necessary to serve the storyline. Ultimately it is a story if a unique, multi generational friendship and of people that want to live their lives they way they always have, without interference. Also a book that highlights poverty and what the lack of opportunities will compel people to do, desperation. I enjoyed it, but be warned it is more a quieter, immersive read, not what I would call a thriller. This author though, sure can write and exceedingly well at that.ARC from Netgalley."
22,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19559507-carolyn,Rating 4 out of 5,"As with her popular Dublin Murder series, Tana French's new novel is set in Ireland, but instead of also being a suspenseful thriller, this stand alone is a more gentle, slow simmering, character driven mystery.Cal Hooper is an ex Chicago cop who decided on making a new start in a small Irish village after his marriage ended just as he put in for early retirement. It's not clear why he chose Ireland rather than a rural area in the US, where he could keep in touch better with the daughter he misses, but hungering for solitude and quiet he nevertheless purchased a run down cottage in Ireland and planned on spending his time fixing it up and getting to know the locals in the village pub. However, when a young teenager called Trey turns up at his place asking for help to find her missing brother Brendan, his cop instincts kick in and against his better judgement he agrees to help. Cal senses something is wrong with the community, but the taciturn locals are not talking to him, making it hard for him to figure out what happened to Brendan.The novel moves at a languid pace and takes quite a while to give us any hints of what Brendan may have been involved in. The characters are well crafted; that of Cal the burnt out cop looking to heal his soul and the thirteen year old Trey, living with her impoverished single mother and yearning for Brendan, the only person who ever cared for her. As Cal gets to know Trey they develop a very strong bond as she is clearly smart and eager to learn from him. Then there are the bunch of local sheep farmers and oddbods to be found in the pub, including Cal's neighbour Mart who has struck up a friendship with him and always seems to be one step ahead of him. The description of the village and a way of life that is in danger of dying out as the young leave for college and city jobs was also poignant and I also enjoyed the description of the rural landscape and the ruggedness of the mountains and bogs surrounding the village. However, the slow pace of the novel and lack of action driven narrative may not appeal to those are expecting a more suspenseful and action packed thriller from this author.With thanks to Penguin and Netgalley for a digital copy to read"
23,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7494963-anne-bogel,Rating 4 out of 5,"I've read every Tana French novel to date, yet I was NERVOUS to pick this one up because the critical reviews ... are not good. And then nothing happened for the first 125 pages. I did enjoy it well enough in the end, but it's certainly different in feel than her Dublin Murder Squad books. French calls The Searcher ""her version of a Western,"" and for the first time, her protagonist is American—a retired Chicago cop who quit the force when he began to doubt his own moral code, and wanted to move far away to start over in a small Irish village. This is also the first time she's written in the third person, and as a writer, I enjoyed noting how that affects the telling. If you're looking for a gripping novel that won't let you go, this isn't it. I would only give the story three stars. But for careful prose from a seasoned writer, and an especially interesting 13-year-old character, this may be worth picking up."
24,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9472704-linda,Rating 4 out of 5,"""The idea of a world with no quest in it has left her lost.""Tana French's eloquent line left me to ponder. Perhaps because it's all part of the human experience. The searching for answers to the unknown where the question itself is off the grid. But isn't life itself a kind of an odyssey that takes us over rough waters and near drowning experiences? Now....more than ever.Former Chicago police detective Cal Hooper sets himself in the pursuit of a different plane of existence. He's retired from the force and has stepped aside from his long term marriage to Donna. Their relationship suffered from his inability to untangle himself from the demands of his work. He still maintains a closeness with his daughter Alyssa who is living on her own. Intermittent phone calls keep them in touch.Cal reaches the next level of passage as he purchases land and a run-down cottage in the highlands of Ireland. He desires space, no language interferences, or even people injecting themselves into his personal life for that matter. But Cal will find that there is no escape from the human element. Especially from determined, hard-headed, persistent individuals on a mission.No matter how isolated you feel that you are, people have an innate radar system within them. Cal's neighbor, Mart, strikes up a friendship with Cal over special cookies. Cal picks them up at Noreen's local store. Cal begins to have a soft spot for the old man, his dog, and his sheep. Mart helps him adjust to country life and the quirks of his fellow neighbors and pub goers. As Cal begins to renovate his cottage, he's almost believing that life is grand.But Cal hasn't met Trey yet. Trey shows up at his door wanting to hire Cal. His teenage years don't quite provide leverage. Trey's brother, Brennan, has gone missing. Cal tries to convince Trey that Brennan, nineteen, has probably gone off on a lark. Homelife is in turmoil since their father ran off leaving their overburdened mother with nothing but a house full of kids. Here's where Tana French constructs a bridge between the cop beaten up by life and a young boy frustrated by the hand he has been dealt. Cal's resources will be limited, but he finally concedes and promises Trey that he will do a bit of investigation. But as Cal uses his talent of prying into people's conversations and lifestyles, he'll come upon more than he's ever bargained for. And how much should he reveal to Trey?The Searcher is a slow, simmering mystery without the ""thriller"" aspect to it. It's deeply character driven with a wide expanse of the Irish countryside. The Searcher is all about reactions. As readers, we experience both the cause and the effect of choices made with knee-jerk decisions that are so emotionally based. And we observe the aftermath of those same decisions. French knows how to set up a scene and she inserts just the right personalities at just the right time.This was my first time reading Tana French. Where have I been? After reading The Searcher, I'm making room for the talented Tana French on my bookshelf."
25,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5210022-julie,Rating 3 out of 5,"The Searcher by Tana French is a 2020 Viking publication.When Cal, a cop from Chicago, retires, he chose to move to a small community in Ireland, buy a fixer upper, and now spends most of his time working on his house, enjoying his solitude.  When a local teen, named Trey, begins hanging around, and eventually gets around to asking Cal to look into the sudden disappearance of a family member, Cal discovers the nice community he’s made himself a part of isn’t all that nice…This story moves as slow as molasses. It took an age for Trey to finally tell Cal what was going on, for the investigation to get off the ground, and for some sort of suspense to develop. While I did like Cal and Trey, and the dynamic that developed between them, the plot was pretty dull, and suspense fell flat. Although French promised this book would not be as depressing as her last stand-alone effort, it was still a melancholy affair, and I can’t say I was happy about the way the crime elements wrapped up. I’m not sure it was a win, to be honest, and it left me feeling dissatisfied. Overall, this second stand-alone is better than that last, for sure, but it still didn’t grab me the way I’d hoped it would. 3 stars"
26,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11701608-barbara,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is my second Tana French novel I’ve read. Of course, I adored “Into the Woods” when it was published. As I understand it, this new one, “The Searcher” is a departure for her in her genre. She’s classifying it as an Irish Western. The Irish landscape plays a prominent role in its beauty and its harsh conditions. Another departure is her protagonist: a retired American policeman. Cal Hooper moves to the countryside of Ireland to regroup. He’s morally disenchanted with his role as a policeman after he was part of a questionable police fatality. He’s recently divorced and has a problematic relationship with his daughter. He wanted to get away and be alone with his thoughts. As with all small rural areas around the world, everyone is in everyone’s business. It’s a place where gossip is the fodder of life.For me, the best part of the novel were the Pub scenes. French knows her Irish pub dwellers. The banter is clever and amusing. I yearned for more.Cal is working on his home when a kid begins spying on him. The kid’s name is Trey, and because of local gossip, knows that Cal is a retired policeman. Trey’s brother is missing and wants Cal to help find him. Adding to the tone of the novel, the busy-body neighbors attempt to set Cal up with a local gal. French writes amusing situations and jocularity in the locals getting all into Cal’s business.French provides various clues as to what could have happened to the brother. It’s the “how” it happened that is the plot twist that made the story stunning.I’ve read that French has an almost cultish following. I can understand why. I need to read her previous works. I listened to the audible production narrated by Roger Clark. Clark is fabulous in his Irish brogue and character voices."
27,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/287912-ellis,Rating 2 out of 5,"I received a copy of this from Netgalley in exchange for a review.I'm obviously going to be glaringly in the minority on this one, but folks, it gives me absolutely no joy to report that among the many real horrors 2020 has wrought, one of its lesser woes includes a bad Tana French book. Cal Hooper has retired from the Chicago police force after his divorce and purchased a dilapidated cottage in a small Irish village. At the start of the book he feels like he's being watched, and so he is, by a local child whose brother is missing and would like help figuring out what happened to him from the former cop. The ensuing story is a predictable slog, written in bloody present tense (my most loathed of tenses) for no good reason. Local child is the only character who isn't flat (charitably, Cal's neighbor the saucy Irish auld guy isn't so bad and has some nice dialogue) and Cal himself is a terrible protagonist. And while I know from terrible Tana French protagonists, she being after all the writer who gave us Rob Ryan and my personal favorite, Scorcher Kennedy, Cal isn't terrible because he's a misogynist like Rob or as amazingly self-centered as Scorcher, he's awful because he's just not very interesting. Cal thinks like a detective and wants to get answers like a detective but has no legal right or reason to be investigating, so his police work for the first half of the book basically amounts to registering verb tenses while having the same conversation with four or five other characters. It's a mildly bizarre choice for French to have made him an American who has recently moved into the area, because most of said investigation hinges on having implausibly revealing chats with locals who don't know him from Adam. A note on American cops: Cal muses on Chicago PD's departmental sensitivity training, annoyed that it teaches his fellow cops nothing about ""not shooting a guy dead on a traffic stop because he happened to be black and a second too slow in following orders."" This inner monologue and a later story about being involved in and bewildered by a shooting involving a young black man - good news, the young man does not die! - seem like French's way of showcasing Cal's status as a Good Cop, given the tendency of real American police to commit racially motivated extrajudicial murders, but while I appreciate that she doesn't necessarily gloss over that fact, it makes me wonder if giving Cal the ability to comment on it is why she chose to make him an American despite how it unnecessarily overcomplicates things. I'll be blunt - had I not been obligated to provide a review, I would have given up on this book early on because life is too short, and although it picked up a bit about 2/3rds of the way through, I sadly got nothing from having forced myself through and finished. Thinking on Scorcher Kennedy has made me want to go read a Dublin murder mystery. I'm not ever going to give up on Tana French as a go to author, but neither am I ever going to revisit this one."
28,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60964126-ceecee,Rating 4 out of 5,"4-5 stars Cal Hooper, ex Chicago PD, relocated to the rural west of Ireland after retirement and the break up of his marriage. He’s fixing up a wreck of a house he bought for a song, now he knows why it was so cheap! He is befriended by his neighbour Mart Larvin who makes this outsider welcome. He feels he is being watched which transpires to be Trey Reddy, a teenager who eventually asks him to find missing brother Brendan. I think this book proves you don’t have to throw everything but the kitchen sink into a plot for it to be good. If you want to read an all action thriller then this isn’t for you but if you want a beautifully written, fascinating slow burner that encapsulates rural Ireland and depicts its lovely people then it is. The pace matches the rural surroundings where the pace of life is slower. I really enjoyed being immersed in the storytelling with its rich characters, great craic and building moments of suspense and tension while Cal catches on to what is going on. I love the images of the rooks laughing at him as he tries to make sense of a different world and not disrupt it too much. It’s very funny in places and I laughed out loud at some of Mart’s thoughts! He is a fantastic character as are all his mates in the bar. This is Tana French’s take on a western and I can see the many analogies clearly in the narrative. For example, Cal is a settler in a new land, he’s almost building his home almost from scratch, there’s a bar/saloon, poteen for moonshine and some of the villagers are like cowboys looking for trouble and certainly finding it!! However, there are definitely 21st Century issues afoot here. There’s acceptance of the truth even though it may not be conventional- maybe another western analogy? I like the way it finishes symbolically with a sense of renewal, with rifts and damage repaired which is very clever. Overall this is an almost lyrical read, it’s captivating and an atmospheric depiction of rural Ireland which took me right back there. Some of the descriptions are superb and the characterisation is excellent. With thanks to NetGalley and Penguin General UK for a much appreciated ARC for an honest review"
29,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70046142-elle,Rating 4 out of 5,"Tana French could teach a masterclass in literary mysteries. The Searcher was one of my most anticipated books of the year, and I’m so relieved that it has lived up to most of those expectations. Is it as good as her famous Dublin Murder Squad series? I mean, no, those books are on another level in my opinion. But this was a well-paced, suspenseful novel with a backdrop in a rural, small Irish town—something right up French’s alley.So if you’re looking for a typical up-tempo thriller, you’re likely to be disappointed with this. The start is slow, but with something itching at the sides of your vision. Something you just can’t shake, but don’t know what it is. It’s a type of menacing that’s like the cold in Ardnakelty, Ireland—it sneaks up on you.Cal Hooper is a former American detective from Chicago, Illinois. After putting in 25 years on the CPD and a difficult divorce, he decides to relocate to a rundown shack in Western Ireland and fix it up as a retirement project. It doesn’t take long for him to notice something amiss in this receding village, and his instincts won’t allow him to ignore it for long. I read in a couple of interviews with the author where she said this is her take on a Western, which I definitely see. It’s more rooted in a movie I hadn’t heard of before, The Searchers from 1956, but I did pick up on a True Grit vibe while reading. A kid comes seeking out Cal to help find justice for a missing brother, and he finds himself unable to refuse.Cal definitely plays the part of ‘outsider cowboy who plays by his own rules’ well. These types of characters can be a hit or miss for me, but Cal is I guess, for lack of a better term, ‘one of the good ones’. If you’re wondering if he falls into that category during his time as a Chicago police officer, it’s never totally made clear. He probably thinks of himself as mostly good, and part of the reason he’s present in Ireland for the events of the book is because of his disillusionment with the department he worked for, but it’s not really relevant to the story. The acknowledgement of police corruption in the US, especially someone from the Chicago PD, felt cursory here. I think there was more of an opportunity to delve into this portion of Cal’s psyche, and it’s not like French hadn’t gone there before with her Dublin Murder officers. But for whatever reason, she backed off before getting into any meaningful commentary. There was just a quick acknowledgement and then moving on.The Searcher has one major thing in common with her last standalone and a few from her series, which is a focus on men and how they interact with each other. Specifically, as an examination of how patriarchal structures negatively impact men and boys as well. Where The Witch Elm featured a main character so lost in his own privilege he couldn’t see things happening two inches in front of his face, The Searcher shows what happens when men who are ill-prepared for a changing world try to retain control of it. What they know is eroding due to time and circumstance and they are incapable of processing these changes.One of the most obvious examples of this is how Cal responds to both the assaults of Trey and Alyssa. To be honest, this comparison ended up being a little on the nose for me, but might not be to a male reader who may have responded similarly to Cal. Here some people, especially men, feel the need to ‘solve’ problems instead of being present and receptive to whoever has turned to them for comfort. When a person close to them, especially if they’re a woman or girl, has been hurt, they feel helpless and don’t know how to process it. So they channel all of that frustration into anger and an attempt to ‘get the bad guy’, even though that’s rarely what the victim wants or needs. Trey, like his daughter Alyssa did years ago, just needed a father figure to care about her and be there for her. By ignoring that need in favor of your own vendetta against the perpetrator, you’re centering your feelings over the victim’s trauma.If you’re the type of person who needs everything to come together neatly, you’ll probably find this book unsatisfying. There’s a rough edge to The Searcher, which I appreciate, but might not be for everyone. I for one would like to gently urge French to write more installments in the Dublin series, but I definitely won’t complain about having this one on the docket."
30,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7407123-pat,Rating 4 out of 5,"That was what I would call a ‘quiet’ thriller. That does not mean cosy. It means something that can move you in a quiet and thoughtful way. The book is not fast paced but it was riveting nonetheless. Tana French’s writing is so lyrical, in this, more than any of her other books I’ve read, she brought Ireland to life for me. I felt as if I were there. And the lilting Irish speech was so wonderful to ‘hear’ (even though I read it, I heard it in my mind). I also felt the claustrophobia that Cal finally felt after moving from a large city to the small Irish Village of Ardnakelty.Calvin John Hooper (Cal) retired from the Chicago Police Department after 25 years and a nasty divorce. He moved to small town Ireland for a complete change and a quiet life restoring the run down cottage he had bought on a few acres. He has interesting chats with his neighbour Mart, who tries to fix him up with a local widow, and enjoys a few evenings in the local watering hole. But while working on his cottage he gets the sense that he is being watched and finally the watcher reveals themselves - a teenager named Trey, skittish and fearful, clearly from a disadvantaged home and not very talkative makes his acquaintance. Cal puts Trey to work and doesn’t push things. After two weeks he is rewarded with the reason Trey is there. The brother, 19 year old Brendan has been missing for 6 months and Trey is desperate to know what happened to him.Cal agrees to look into it - reluctantly and after a a great deal of deliberation. But his search, digging as it must under what goes on in the village, uncovers some ugly truths that he perhaps wishes were never unearthed. There is no unknowing what he learns and Cal must think long and hard about what he is going to do with this info. If you must have adrenalin in your books you probably won’t like this one. But if you like the odd quiet but deep and personal journey with beautiful writing and vividly drawn characters with warts and all you will love this latest offering by Tana French. Many thanks to Netgalley, the publisher and Tana French for my copy. My opinions are my own."

An ex-cop Cal Hooper moves to the Irish countryside after a divorce and a retirement from the police force in Chicago as he seeks a lifestyle change.

Trey is an outcast amongst his peers and his only friend, his brother Brendan, disappeared a few months ago. Trey knows Brendan would never leave without saying goodbye and wants Cal to help him find out what happened to his missing brother.Similarly to The Wych Elm, The Searcher is a slowburn mystery suited mainly for patient readers who appreciate well-written books with drawn out characters and clever plotting rather than books with rapid twists and turns.

32,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15055195-gary,Rating 4 out of 5,I loved 'The Dublin Murder' series by Tana French so I was really looking forward to this one. This stand alone book is a lot different to that series although just as gripping. This is a story of ex detective Cal Hooper who following his move to rural Ireland is looking for a complete life change. He plans to spend most of his time renovating a cottage that is need of urgent repairs. His well intended dreams are interrupted when a a local boy asks him to help find his missing brother. The family is far from liked by the locals and there is little urgency by anyone including the police to locate the brother. Cal feels the need to help and find trouble beckoning.This is not a fast paced thriller but a masterclass in storytelling with the author bringing the pages to life and making you feel like you can see the characters and scenery. This is excellent writing but not sure if it will be appreciated by lovers of fast paced thrillers.I would like to thank both Netgalley and Penguin UK for supplying a copy of this novel in exchange for an honest review.
33,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5903843-matt,Rating 4 out of 5,"Tana French is back with another unique novel, her second consecutive standalone. Those not familiar with her work may have a little trouble grasping everything, but long-time fans will see a glimmer of something that only French can provide in her writing. A retired cop decides to settle in rural Ireland, hoping to put his work life and failed marriage behind him. However, when someone approaches him to help locate a young man that no one around town seems to care has gone missing, Cal Hooper takes up the cause, only to realise there is more to the story than meets the eye. Tana French is masterful with this slow mystery, which is full of rich narrative but never in a hurry to get there, which is delightful for a reader such as myself. The book is aptly named The Searcher, as it is both Cal and the reader who seek to find their home way throughout this piece. Highly recommended to the patient reader and those who love a good dose of French’s Irish storytelling!Cal Hooper spent many years working for the Chicago PD as a detective. However, upon his retirement, he’s discovered that not only is he unsure what to do with himself, but that his marriage has disintegrated for many reasons. On a whim, Cal purchases a home and moves to rural Ireland—the fictitious town of Ardnakelty—where everyone is as local as can be. Cal bridges the divide as best he can with the locals, some of whom are interested in his backstory, while others want him to mind his business, so they can pry into his. When Cal is approached by Trey Reddy to help locate the tween’s older brother, it seems like something a little too taxing on his retirement. However, Trey is insistent and takes things to a new level before Cal agrees to poke around and ask a few questions. How could Brendan Reddy, spry at nineteen, have up and disappeared without anyone taking notice? Furthermore, how could no one take an interest in this at all? Cal soon learns that no one really cares much about the kids from his family, a household of scholastic truants if ever there was one. As Cal digs a little deeper, he discovers many possible outcomes as to what might have happened to Brendan, though no clear and single option that supersedes the others. Surrounded by the bucolic countryside, Cal makes some progress and discovers a thread that opens many other doors. There is certainly something to this missing individual, but it will take effort and a passion to bring it all to light. Uncovering something dark and troubling, Cal discovers that while no one care about Brendan Reddy, there are many who will act violently about anyone who dares press the matter.I remember when I discovered Tana French and her writing. It was certainly much different than anything else I had read in a series and police procedural. While some bemoan the tangential style of writing, I relish it, as it sticks out and makes the reader take note. There are so many small things buried in the narrative that French provides the reader, though they cannot and will not be spoon-fed. It is the reader’s responsibility to pledge their dedication to join the adventure. Cal Hooper is a wonderful protagonist, with his backstory and character development on offer throughout this piece. Choosing to reinvent himself after a life in Chicago, Cal finds himself the new and untrusted individual as soon as he arrives. Feeling as though he is sometimes on Mars, Cal must forge friendships and see how he can make himself approachable, which has him reflecting back on the foibles he made with this own family. Struggling not to push too hard, yet also be likeable, Cal sets himself up to succeed while helping a family no one thinks about at any point in their day.The handful of key secondary characters is helpful to better understand the larger story. French injects them throughout, providing unique and usually Irish personalities, some of whom clash significantly with Cal Hooper. French leaves the reader feeling as though they, too, are in the Irish back country, with personalities and linguistic quirks. Some of these folks offer the reader insight into the larger plot, while others seek to impede with progress however they can. This is a wonderful story throughout. While I would not call it complex, it is far from simple. The narrative develops slowly and the reader must face that head-on throughout the reading experience. There are times for plot development and those for character enhancement. This is not a quick read for the beach of aboard the plane, though some readers think they can do that. Rather, it takes time and that should not be rushed. The reading experience is always enhanced with paced and contemplative understanding of Tana French. It is the impatient reader who usually tosses their hands in the air and says French is not up to the caliber of others in the genre. Kudos, Madam French, for another winning novel. I am always eager to see what you have to say and how you get it across.Love/hate the review?

He wants to punch something, but he knows that would do nothing but bust his knuckles. Having that much sense makes him feel old.”He’s 48, not old, but bone-weary from life as a Chicago cop who is missing his ex-wife (she split) and adult daughter, both a world away from his new home and his back field in the backwoods of Ireland. He is definitely, defiantly retired. No more crims, no more suspecting everything that moves. However. . . “Too many years on the beat in bad hoods, now farm hands look like gangbangers.”I say “backwoods”, because it’s a term often used in the States to refer to an old-fashioned, probably poor, possibly hillbilly area. People vary from salt-of-the-earth, old-school (and all those hyphenated phrases) to a few folks with a screw loose who may have grown up there or who may have ended up there, removed from society, as much for society's sake as their own.The story moves slowly, which I enjoyed at first, getting used to Cal and his attempts to smooth out his life as he restores the old furniture and old house he’s bought on the strength of photos on a website. “Landscape is one of the few things he knows of where the reality doesn’t let you down. The West of Ireland looked beautiful on the internet; from right smack in the middle of it, it looks even better. The air is rich as fruitcake, like you should do more with it than just breathe it; bite off a big mouthful, maybe, or rub handfuls of it over your face.”Sigh . . . It looks like he made the right choice, but he can’t put his ex-wife and daughter out of his mind. I have to say that was ok the first few times he thought about them, but I think I could have done without so much of them in the story. The locals have been pleasant enough to him. “Up until last week he felt that he had been, if not exactly welcomed with open arms, at least accepted as a mildly interesting natural phenomenon, like maybe a seal that had taken up residence in the river.”Then he hears noises outside his house at night and finally discovers Trey, a shy, nervous 13-year-old kid who seems to adopt him. As Trey starts helping with the refinishing of an old desk, Cal learns that big brother Brendan Reddy has disappeared without so much as a good-bye note for Trey, who adores him.Cal doesn’t appreciate the tingling of his copper’s nerves, but he can’t help it. He begins to befriend some of the locals and decides to check out Trey’s family, high up in the hills. On the way home, his friendly, nosy neighbour spots him.“‘Went for a walk up the mountain. Stood in a patch of bog, though, so I came home.’ Cal holds up his wet boot. ‘Watch yourself around them bogs, now,’ Mart says, inspecting the boot. Today he’s wearing a dirty orange baseball cap that says boat hair don’t care. ‘You don’t know their ways. Step in the wrong patch and you’ll never step out again. They’re fulla tourists; eat ’em like sweeties, so they do.’ He shoots Cal a wicked slantwise look. ‘Gee,’ ,Cal says. ‘I didn’t realise I was taking my life in my hands.’‘And that’s before you start on the mountainy men. They’re all stone mad, up there; split your head open as soon as look at you.’ ‘Tourist board wouldn’t like you,’ Cal says. ‘Tourist board hasn’t been up them mountains. You stay down here, where we’re civilised.’”Stone mad is not what he was searching for in Ireland. Nor was he searching for a “case” or a kid to restore or refinish along with his furniture. What he expected was more people like the match-making shopkeeper and other warm, Irish souls. A rather attractive woman with new puppies wasn’t expected either. I can’t decide if I like having those people in the story or not. Maybe I did. I was thrown completely by a sudden reveal more than half-way through, which made things more difficult for him and for which he needed some help from them, so all in all, I enjoyed the book. But without French's Irish atmosphere, it would have been much less satisfying.Thanks to NetGalley and Penguin/Viking for the review copy from which I’ve quoted."

This is a deeply moving tale of a lonesome, retired cop and a lonesome teen, and the remarkable bond they forge in their search for a missing young man. It is, like much of French's work, built solidly on authentic characters and precise details. The plot, in some ways, is less important than the people, and that's what makes her work such a joy."
38,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn,Rating 4 out of 5,"“A friend will help you hide, but a good friend will help you hide a body”Irish writer Tana French, author of the Dublin murder series, delivers another excellent page turner set this time in a fictional west Ireland village. A retired Chicago police officer has bought an old house and settles in to local community and gets dragged in to some drama.One thing French does exceptionally well every time is to create characters that demonstrate the subtle nuances of a culture steeped in oppression but that is adopting to new times. The Ireland that French describes is at a crossroads and reading her rich prose mesmerizes a reader who is drawn in from page one.This was something of a slow starter actually, as French creates the setting and introduces the players. Cal Hooper is renovating an old house when a child begins to come around. Cal is drawn in to an informal investigation into a missing brother. The village, north of Galway and secluded, is the kind of place where everyone knows each other, and they all know secrets. A tall American asking questions draws his own attention.Exploring themes of family, poverty, crime and group dynamics, French has given us another great book."

A retired American cop moves to a small Irish town and gets roped into investigating the disappearance of a local teen. I liked the usual Tana French moves - digging into the narrator's psyche, long, tricky conversations with witnesses, the mood of danger bleeding through seemingly innocuous encounters. But what The Searcher is missing is a good ole nervous breakdown I expect from French. This book felt strangely safe in many ways, uplifting even. I thought Cal Hooper would be, you know, darker and more tortured. I need my Tana French investigators crying and tearing their hair out in despair at the end. Or worse. "

Then life, in his new Irish village intervenes and Cal finds himself pulled into a direction he thought he had left behind.Cal meets a young boy, Trey, bought up rough being one of many children whose father is absent, and whose beloved brother is missing or so Trey thinks.

For underneath runs something evil that has taken a hold of the town and entwines itself into the people What Cal was hoping to escape now finds him even though he believed himself to be tucked away into peace and security. One can run but they really can't hide.This was a wonderfully written story so captured the wit and the supposed joi du vive of the Irish people. The town is just the place where so many of us might wish to reside, its smallness and hail fellow well met atmosphere makes for a place where one feels they are an integral part of its very life's blood. However, as the author so deftly points out, there is no place that is totally immune from the ills of today and though we might search, just as Cal did, we will never find that spot where all is perfect.Jan and I so enjoyed this story. It was simply told and yet bore so much in the telling that we could relate to. The writing was enticing, drawing the reader into its story and as we became more entrenched in the happenings, we realized that life is never simple no matter where we live."
41,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1381728-maxwell,Rating 4 out of 5,"[4.5 stars]Tana French's second standalone novel, The Searcher, follows Cal Hooper, a retired cop from Chicago who seeks solace in the peaty hillsides of western Ireland. He's bought an abandoned cottage he plans to fix up and relax in until the day Trey Reddy shows up on his doorstep. Trey's brother Brendan went missing several months before, and Trey needs Cal's help finding him...or at least what may have happened to him. From there we go on the journey to discover and uncover the secrets mired in the bogs of Ireland and in the minds of Cal's fellow townspeople.As with every Tana French book, the writing is impeccable. She can so deftly convey not only the actualities of a scene but their feelings so incredibly well. I felt like I was also mist-soaked and mud-laden. I could see the wild gorse and heather, hear the rooks' calls, and smell the peat. It took me right back to the countryside of Ireland. But not only is her writing great, her plotting is technically brilliant. While some might find this a bit slower and less propulsive than French's other novels—Cal is a retired cop rather than an active detective, so his investigation is a bit more off-the-cuff and under the radar—I found it just as compelling. I also really appreciated the way she tied Cal's family life into the present day and even found myself getting a bit teary-eyed near the end. There are some really poignant, beautiful moments in this novel unlike in her others.While this might not be my favorite of her works, it's still a very solid contribution to her bibliography. French continues to cement herself as one of my favorite writers, with consistent prose, engaging storytelling, and well-realized characters. "

Cal never could stand to leave a case unresolved.”If I'd read The Searcher without knowing the author's identity, I'd never have guessed that it was a novel by Tana French.Because the narrative in The Searcher is told in the third-person, it felt far less intimate and intricate than the Dublin Murder Squad series (which, with the exception of The Secret Place, have a first-person pov) so it took me awhile to warm up to French's prose. While I understand that 'sticking' to the same writing style book after book must get tiring, I can't say that I particularly liked French's 'new' style (in fact, while reading I found myself longing for her 'usual' prose). And even if The Searcher was by no means incompetently written, the language French uses wasn't quite as literary or complex as the one in her previous novels.Onto the actual story: after becoming increasingly disillusioned with the police force Cal, our main character, retires from Chicago's police force and decides to re-locate to the fictional Ardnakelty, a remote small village in the West of Ireland. Here he spends his time fixing up his decrepit new house and bantering with his neighbour.The narrative moves at an incredibly slow pace...which would have been fine by me if pace had been sacrificed in favour of characterisation. But Cal isn't an incredibly compelling or complex protagonist. What we get instead are long and detailed descriptions about Cal painting his desk or doing up something in his new house. While he goes on about his day he starts to feel as if someone is watching him.After some more time passes he meets Trey, a kid from a poor and disreputable family. Trey's brother is missing so he enlists Cal to find out what happened to him. Cal, who wants to keep his head down, is initially reluctant to get involved, however, as he spends more time with Cal (fixing up his furniture, hunting) he decides to help Trey.French brings to life the slightly claustrophobic atmosphere of a small village. In a community where everyone seems to know everybody's business, Cal quickly realises how difficult it is to escape the shadow of your family. Although Trey is only thirteen, Ardnakelty residents believe that because he comes from a 'rotten' family he's bad egg.Cal makes slow progress in his 'investigation'. He has little authority in the village, so he has to play up his 'Yankee' persona in order to get some answers. Still, the people he questions are reticent to talk and soon enough Cal realises that he has ruffled some of the locals feathers.French vividly renders Cal's environment, on the very first page we get this stunning description:""The sky, dappled in subtle gradations of grey, goes on forever; so do the fields, coded in shades of green by their different uses, divided up by sprawling hedges, dry stone walls and the odd narrow back road.""The Irish countryside is by turns idyllic and menacing, just as the people who inhabit the land. Much of the banter Cal has with his neighbour or with other men at the local pub carries a not-so-friendly edge. Seemingly harmless exchanges carry the possibility of danger. Yet, even if Cal is aware of this, and of the possibility of upsetting or antagonising the entire village, he's unwilling to give up his search.The mystery often took the backseat in favour of scenes detailing Cal's daily routing (fixing up the house, fishing, going to the local store, phoning his daughter). There were also quite a lot of conversations about topics I didn't particularly care for (look, I like dogs as much as the next person but my mind will start going blank if I have to read a few pages describing 'pups').The dynamic between Cal and Trey was the most compelling aspect of this book. I did wish that some scenes of Trey interacting with his family could have been included as they would have given a fuller picture of his life.Even if I wasn't as interested in Mart or Lena, their words always rang true and they could provide some amusing moments. Cal, on the other hand, sometimes said things that didn't entirely convince me. While he did question himself and his own behaviour, and I did appreciate that he struggled with the meaning of 'doing the right thing', his character was a bit of a blank at times. Although we are given his view on his job, on his feelings about police brutality, racial profiling, and corruption, as well as an impression of the kind of relationship that he has with his daughter and ex-wife, Cal's main characteristic is that he is 'American'. And sometimes what he said sounded a bit too American, even in those instances when he wasn't playing up this role. His motivations for picking Ireland as his new home were also left unexplored. And what did his daughter think of this relocation? We simply know that she's busy working but we don't learn of her reaction upon discovering that her father had chooses to retire and move across the ocean.The mystery storyline takes a rather predictable direction and I never felt any real sense of suspense. There were quite a few scenes that were just boring and added little to the overall story.At the end of the day, The Searcher doesn't offer a new spin on the Town with a Dark Secret™. The more I think about it the less I like this novel. It has a kind of Hot Fuzz sort of story (minus the laughs): we have a protagonist who 'can't switch off' who goes to a small village and learns the meaning of friendship and finds out that there is a reason why locals don't want him to investigate certain things.An okay read but nothing like French's usual.Read more reviews on my blog / / / View all my reviews on Goodreads"
44,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1213607-julie,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Searcher may be set in a (fictional) village deep in Ireland's green, cool, shadowed west, but it has all the elements of a classic American western: the lone and lonely, deeply principled lawman; a taciturn frontier woman with a soft heart and nicely-fitting blue jeans; a friendly-on-the-surface set of locals who fall silent when a stranger enters the saloon; and a troubled youngster who becomes attached to our hero, just like Joey in Shane. Funny how a contemporary Irish mystery can wrap itself around tropes from another genre and come up with something so deliciously original and fresh that I just hug myself thinking about it. I loved this novel.Cal Hooper takes his retirement pension from twenty-five years as a cop in Chicago and buys a dilapidated house on a few hectares in the middle of nowhere, southwest Ireland (full disclosure- one of my favorites spots on the planet and likely not far from the setting of my second novel). He doesn't know anyone and doesn't much seem to care at the outset; he's happy to putter about the place, fishing in the nearby stream and slowing restoring his cottage at the foot of what Ireland considers mountains. Then Trey shows up from a shabby homestead a couple of miles up the road, a near-feral kid who is clearly starving for attention. Cal puts Trey to work on some simple carpentry and painting and the two develop a careful, quiet bond. Soon the real motivation for the visits is revealed: Trey's beloved older brother Brendan is missing and Trey wants the American former police detective to investigate his disappearance. Cal, perhaps feeling guilt for the daughter he left behind in America who is dealing with lingering trauma from a violent mugging many years before, and unable to leave his detective sensibilities at the border, begins a cautious inquiry into Brendan's circle and his activities. But there is no way, in this tiny community whose residents have lived in each others' back pockets for generations, that a tall, dark, handsome stranger who knows his way around the rifle he's waited months to get a license to carry is going to go unnoticed. His questions ripple through the village in tighter and tighter circles until they becomes waves that split Trey's lip, blacken the kid's eyes, and Cal realizes he is risking more lives than his own. The bond between love-and-nourishment starved Trey and gruff Cal is one of the greatest pleasures in this rich, slow-burn of a novel. French takes her time to build the tension, allowing us to savor the beautiful setting, to be charmed by the quirky villagers, particularly Mart, Cal's nearest neighbor who regularly appears to heckle Cal about his home repairs and cajoles him to appear at the pub for nights of music and dangerously smooth moonshine. All of this gentle scene setting is masterfully underlaid with tension. The sense of impending doom is so nuanced, woven with village charm and the hint of romantic interest, that we are carried along, seduced by the western motif of untamed wilderness, the lone defender of justice, a woman and child vulnerable to the hidden forces of evil lurking just offstage. It is wholly immersive, somehow universal in theme and yet deeply intimate. As a writer, and a writing teacher/mentor, I assert that one of the most important elements of storytelling is also one of the most difficult to articulate and execute: understanding the difference between story and plot. Plot is simply a series of events that occur through the course of a novel. The plot is what happens. Story is why it happens. And we read for story, we read because we fall headlong into emotion for the characters — love or loathing, it doesn't matter — a writer on her game makes us feel, and feel deeply.A simplistic definition would state that ""literary"" fiction is driven by characters, their motivations and journey, i.e. the story; genre fiction is driven by the stuff that happens, i.e., the plot. The very best books, the ones we can't put down, that resonate long after we've reached The End? Those are the books whose authors managed a perfect balance between an engaging plot and an engrossing story. All this throat-clearing to say that for this reader, and writer, The Searcher, which may be classified a crime fiction, or literary thriller, or mystery- is just such a novel. It transcends genre to be storytelling perfection. I have heretofore not been a great fan of Tana French- I'm in a tiny minority, I know! I read the first two in the Dublin Murder Squad series years ago, and decided it just wasn't for me; I tried French more recently again with The Witch Elm and although I read it through, I had to fight urges along the way to huck it at the wall. I have developed a new sensibility for police procedurals in recent years as I attempt to write my own and I know French is a master of the genre, so I'm back at the Dublin Murder Squad for another try; we'll see how it goes.Oh, but The Searcher. 2021 will end with this in my list of Top Reads of the Year. It's all that, and a bag of chips."
45,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4271946-jessica-woodbury,Rating 4 out of 5,"When THE WITCH ELM came out, I know many Tana French fans were frustrated. They said it was too long and too slow and not what they wanted from French. Welp, if that was you, I have bad news: THE SEARCHER is even slower. There are Dublin Murder Squad novels that have more plot in a single chapter than you get in this entire book. The entire first third is just a guy in his house in the Irish countryside fixing an old desk. (I am only slightly exaggerating. That's almost it.) If you were okay with the change in pace from THE WITCH ELM, then you should be fine here. Although there are definitely some curiosities in THE SEARCHER that I don't know that French totally pulls off. It's not a bad book, I'm not sure she can write one, but it's the first time I've read a Tana French book noticing the flaws on my first read. The thing is, that when I look at those flaws I see just what French is trying to do. There are ways she's pushing herself towards something new and different here. And risk can do that. It's just a little unusual when I usually can't find the cracks in anything she does.Still, there are moments where she is so incredibly good at what she's doing that you have to go back and reread the section you just finished just to make sure you didn't miss anything. There is one long chapter that is just a bunch of drunk men in a pub laughing and arguing and needling each other that sure looks like nothing at all is happening, and French never describes the evening as menacing or full of dread, and yet it is all very very very important and it's as meticulously done as her interrogation scenes, which are some of the best things she writes. Our protagonist, Cal Hooper, may be an ex-cop but he's not like our previous police protagonists. We're used to her cops: melancholy, tortured, ambitious, troubled, etc. etc. Many of them are not really ""good"" but we love them somehow anyway. They talk us into it, mostly, since French's novels are usually in the first person. Even the least charismatic of them (I'd say either Frank or Stephen) still manages to get you on their side. Cal is older, he's American (retired Chicago PD), he's recently divorced. Cal is vaguely dissatisfied with everything and he's done that thing men in a midlife crisis do where he decides to become this other version of himself he has in his head. He moves to an old house in the Irish countryside and decides that he will live there, quiet and solitary, fixing it up. He has not given it much additional thought.I kept finding myself so fascinated that French writes mostly about men. Especially after her close study of Toby, the charming but vacuous guy from THE WITCH ELM. In a way, THE SEARCHER follows a similar track. Cal is a certain kind of man. He sees himself as a good man who had a good job and supported his wife and daughter to give them a good life. But he's reached a point where nothing feels good anymore and underneath what everything was on the surface, nothing much is left. Cal sees this new life as his chance to build something that's more than just surfaces. He wants simplicity. He doesn't get it. (Obvi.)French has a strangely light hand here. Sometimes I really loved it, she doesn't just straight up tell you, ""Look, can you see the crisis he's having? Do you understand how it relates to all these other things I've told you about him?"" She just gives you the pieces and leaves it to you to put them together to see what she's trying to do. That, I liked. It also seems to suit Cal's own thinking. He doesn't have much of an ability to deeply analyze motives, especially his own. He can read people but he can't go too much deeper than that. But this can be frustrating. I get that probably her whole goal here was to write a guy like Cal. But I'm not convinced that Cal is someone who sees police work as something that has become less good. (I'm not convinced even a little.) There is one anecdote we get about Cal's time on the force that works well for purposes of the story and yet... it felt too pat. It was just the thing French needed to be rather than something that I felt a cop who'd been on the job for decades would really think. He also seems to have a good eye in recognizing and working around particular types of trauma, which also struck me as odd. It's certainly not something you'd expect from a Chicago cop.If I pull that one piece out of the book, I like it a lot more. Though I think the story French is telling is not terribly satisfying. I can't tell whether she intended that or not. THE WITCH ELM had some similar elements, certainly. At one point, the only actual character who is reasonable (you will recognize her immediately) says to Cal, ""Are you done doing stupid things yet?"" and I wanted to yell ""Right????"" Cal does not get to be a first person narrator and that is probably for the best, because to Cal everything that happens here happens to him, he had no other choices, he made all the right calls, and it was what it was. As the reader, well, maybe you see that but there is definitely another interpretation to these events and it is mine and it is that Cal is frustrating and dumb on a variety of levels. I suspect this is all what French wants, surely she wouldn't give us this plot (when we finally get to one) where Cal's approach to finding a missing young man is basically one of those Family Circus comics where the kid goes everywhere but the one place he should so clearly go. It is exhausting, and yet I can't say it isn't true to the character. It absolutely is. I guess French just wanted to drive me up the wall with this one and she succeeded. When you have read this book, go ahead and tell me and I will sit with you and commiserate about how Cal should have just talked to Mart as soon as he realized Mart knew what was up and stuck with those guys, PJ definitely would have caved, instead of going after Donie over and over and why didn't he understand that maybe this lesson he finally learned about just trying to help a kid who so clearly needs help was something he had no excuse not to know earlier and don't forget the whole weird thing about his discovery of Trey's gender and how no one ever considers that she might be trans but also it was kind of a relief that they didn't because Cal definitely would not have handled it well and we will yell about it together. And yet. I can't deny that Cal maybe grew a little as a person? That he may have taken a roundabout track to get there but maybe he is actually in the right place at the end? As annoyed as that makes me--I cannot endorse Cal's choices--I can't deny it's basically true. This is French's take on a Western, after all, and while Cal certainly isn't as bad as the ""hero"" from the film THE SEARCHER, the title alone is a cue that we may not have the most ethical character at the center of our story. French is certainly considering a John-Wayne-esque kind of attitude, an assumption of right without a full examination of it. (I liked THE LOST MAN by Jane Harper quite a lot, which considers many of the same elements and I'd be curious to read the two side by side.)"
46,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42080115-elizabeth-george,Rating 5 out of 5,"When it comes to the psychology behind criminal behavior, Tana French pretty much hits it out of the part, and this novel is no exception. Her sense of place is stunning, her characters are fully realized with all their foibles and flaws, and her plotting is impeccable. This books takes place in the Republic of Ireland, in the countryside outside of Dublin. Reading it, I felt as if I were there. Elements of it are pure Irish--I loved the part cataloguing someone's disapproval of ever joining the Tidy Towns--and since her main character is a cop retired from the Chicago police, we see everything through the eyes of a man who's never been to Ireland before. She writes with an intensely experienced third person POV, demonstrating both skill and mastery over her craft. This is a writer's novel--there is much to admire from that standpoint--at the same time as it's a fiction-lover's novel. I loved it. "
47,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416888-heidi,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5What I love about Tana French, even when I don’t always 5-star love each book, is that no two books of hers are alike. There are a lot of adjectives to describe The Searcher but suspenseful, action-oriented, page turning and surprising aren’t on the list. Because of that, some French fans may be disappointed in her latest. Me? I loved this book and how it both savored the “place” and was a thoroughly lovely, yet dark and human, character study- of both Cal, the American main character, and the town in Ireland that is his adopted home after retiring from the Chicago Police Force. This is a dissection of life in a small town where everyone knows everyone. Cal quickly becomes involved with a local mystery that no one really cares to solve. From there the book begins to darken and Cal faces judgement from his neighbors, his conscience and new friends. Again, this proves that French is just becoming a stronger writer with every book. Highly recommend this stand-alone mystery."
48,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51395417-brian,Rating 4 out of 5,"“…it’s a mad world we live in, hah? You’d never know where it’d take you.”I know a few people who love the books of Tana French, so when a friend lent me a copy of THE SEARCHER, I moved it up on my “to read” pile.This novel is a slow burn. It builds and creeps up on the reader. For the first 50 pages I was not into it, and then I was. It is not heart pounding action, or intellectual guessing games, it is just solid character writing in a very atmospheric setting.The plot, Cal Hooper (retired from the Chicago PD) moves to a small village in western Ireland. A child knocks on his door and asks him to investigate the disappearance of an older sibling. And from there French tells a story that is not about a disappearance, and certainly not a conventional mystery. It transcends that genre. French is deft at creating a living atmosphere and sense of place that is as much a character as anything else in the text. Lines like these I enjoyed:“The dark is busy around here.”“He enjoys the rain. It has no aggression to it.”“Here, the first light spreads across the fields like something holy is happening …”I would categorize THE SEARCHER as a literary mystery, although really the mystery is just the plot device that allows for character development. That does not mean it is boring. There is depth, yes, but also some nice twists. There was one surprise I did not see coming, and one that I did see a mile down the road. But the twist I knew was coming was handled in a manner I was not expecting and was thus still pleasing.The truth of human experience and interaction is demonstrated in THE SEARCHER, and that alone makes it good.I end with some more lines that I think demonstrate that point.* “…hammering on and on at something that’s never going to break gets a man nothing but tired and sore.”* “He sometimes gets the feeling that Donna has methodically erased all their good times from her memory, so that she can move on into her shiny new life without ripping herself up. If he doesn’t keep them in his, they’ll be gone like they never happened.” (This FLOORED me!)* “His four best buddies were among the reasons he left Chicago; the depth and detail with which they knew him had come to feel unsafe…”* “Everyone was always talking about talking, and the most moral person was the one who yelled at the most other people for doing the talking all wrong.” (This is from a moment in the text that in its entirety destroys “woke” culture, although I am not sure that was the intention)* “Everything he’s been since that moment has been worth nothing, and he doesn’t even know what the moment was.”* “Complicating this is the fact that he can’t remember the last time he was in a room with a woman he liked the idea of talking to, and he’s unsure whether this is a point in favor of sticking around or of getting the hell out of Dodge.”* “Seems like I’m always looking for something to hold me down. It just never works out that way.”* “…finds himself floored by both the vast importance and the vast impossibility of saying the right thing…”* “…but Cal learned a long time ago never to underestimate the spectacular natural wonder that is people’s stupidity.”"

This isn’t going to have a happy ending.
There’s nothing quite like that feeling when you finish a book and think “now what the eff am I going to read after THAT?!?!?!?!” Man, bookhangovers – they are a rarity for me, but last night when I finished up The Searcher that’s exactly how I felt. I had only read (and enjoyed) Tana French once before, but my real life bookpal recommended this one . . . . with trepidation . . . . so I immediately downloaded it from the library. (I ride or die with my book besties because they don’t ever tend to steer me wrong.) I understand her hesitation on telling me about this one, though, because not only is it 450+ pages and she’s well aware I’m a dumb dumb baby who likes my stories wrapped up in about 100 pages less than that, but also because this one is a slow roller. But I’m telling you it was a slow roller in the best possible way for me. The story absorbed me like fog rolling across the backyard on my favorite types of quiet Saturday mornings out on the deck with my cup of Joe. I loved Cal instantly and grew to love him even more as the “why” behind how he had wound up in Ireland after retiring from the police force back in the States was explained. And I love a kid in a book about once a year, so kudos to you little Trey – you done good at making me fall in love with you as well. The mystery here doesn’t even get mentioned until nearly the 100 page mark, so I’m not kidding when I say you need to be patient and just let yourself be sucked in by the atmosphere for a bit. Not to mention, it’s not the most mysterious of mysteries. You KNOW things ain’t gonna end up great, you just have to keep reading for the details.I vaguely remember this being a bit of a miss when it was released, but again I’m not a Tana French reader historically so I was not trying to compare apples to apples. If I were to compare this to anyone, it would be David Joy – and that’s about the finest compliment I can give an author so it’s getting all the Stars.Oh, and if you’re wondering what I decided to pick up next I pretty much spun the wheel on my NetGalley backlog and ended up with Best Men. It’s completely different from this, but Max is already charming me."

Trey’s brother Brendan went missing several months ago. Trey has heard that Cal was a cop and wants his help finding out what may have happened to Brendan. From there we go on a meandering journey to get to know and to uncover the secrets of Cal’s new town and its people.Don’t go into this novel expecting anything like a Dublin Murder Squad story or a thriller of any kind. Yes, there is a mystery and some violence but it is the slowest, most unhurried mystery you will ever read. It moves at the same slow pace as the small rural Irish town in which it is set. The plot of this mystery meanders through the novel but, in French's signature style, the story is more about the psychologically nuanced characters and their relationships. Tana French takes her time beautifully describing the community, its townspeople and their gatherings at the town pub and the natural beauty of the area including the heather-filled mountains and the local farms. Some people will find the pace of this book too slow, just as I did at times. But I kept reading because I became very invested in the lives of the two main characters and enjoyed the beauty and depth of French’s writing which has never been better. I think this story will stay with me for a long time."

Mainly for the writing which is still of a high quality - where it fell down for me was in the story and length of time it took to get anywhere. Then when it did get somewhere pretty much at the end, it wasnt that interesting. Main character Cal, ex Chicago cop moved to rural Ireland to escape the rat race but somehow discovering people are people good and bad pretty much everywhere, I thought was a bit of a cliche for a writer of French's calibre. Her descriptive sense of rural life was beautifully crafted but there was too much of it. The Wych Elm, as an example, is a tome but I devoured every page, none of it was wasted time but with The Searcher I found myself skim reading great chunks just to get to an actual plot development. That underlying sense of tension, that feeling you are heading towards something you cant escape, that is one of the biggest strengths of previous books, it is entirely missing here in my opinion. Sorry to say the resolution felt phoned in and overall I only really finished it out of loyalty to the author and in the hope of a kick ass finale that would make it all worthwhile. I'll probably be a minority opinion and that I don't mind at all. I'll just settle in and wait for the next book. You cant always love everything your favourite authors put out. This is obviously that one."

Tana French draws me pictures with words of settings that I can climb right into and see, hear, and smell the atmosphere for myself. From page 1, I am pausing to reread passages, in awe of her writing.This is a stand alone with nothing to do with her Dublin Murder Squad series at all. It takes place in the countryside of a small rural Irish town. A recently divorced ex-cop, Cal, from Chicago has retired there to a fixer-upper, and living alone in a strange place with suspicious sounds can make one's imagination go wild. Cal is warily making friends of the good ole boys who have been there forever and also a troubled kid who starts hanging around his place. These people are dripping in secrets. Cal didn't want to relive his cop days but is dragged into looking into a young man's disappearance. It has quite a few twists, which kept the pages turning. Not fast action or romantic, just good storytelling and terrific writing, with moral and ethical undertones."

A retired Chicago detective intending to enjoy repairing his crumbling Irish digs, becomes mixed up in the search for a local kid’s missing brother. Nothing is as placid as it appears in this small Irish village and backstories abound. The pacing of this novel is a bit slower than other of French’s novels but this in no way detracts from the suspense, atmosphere, or intelligent plotting at which the author excels. "
58,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/796425-jeanette-ms-feisty,Rating 3 out of 5,"This is your periodic reminder that I do not consider three stars a low rating. It means I liked it and it coulda been better. Tana French writes beautifully about the Irish countryside and the people who inhabit it. This is a novel to be read more for the writing than for the plot, if ya know what I mean. And also for some of the colorful characters. I especially enjoyed the sisters Noreen and Lena--tough broads with good hearts. One of the nice things about living in a small town is that everyone knows you. If you're ever in a bind, people will try to help you. If you're going through a rough patch, the local store might give you credit till you can get back on your feet. If there's a death in your family, people will offer comfort and food. If your car breaks down, someone will offer you a ride. It's nice to be seen, to be known. One of the not nice things about living in a small town is that everyone knows you. This is especially not nice sometimes if you have lived all your life in that small town. Nobody will ever let you forget your history. You can't break out of the role that has been created for you. If you wet your pants in grade school, or got drunk as a teenager and jumped in the hot tub with all your clothes on, or married the wrong man, or couldn't hold down a job, no one will ever let you forget. And if someone new moves in to town, people will make sure to fill them in on your biography. For me, the above two paragraphs were what this novel was all about. Yes, there's a mystery, but the mystery itself is not as interesting as what it reveals about this charming and troubled Irish village. There's Trey, a teenage kid in need of a father figure, and retired Chicago cop Cal Hooper takes on a bit of that role, somewhat reluctantly. Eventually Cal agrees to search for Trey's missing brother Brendan. Cal discovers a lot of sinister shit in the process of trying to figure out what happened to Brendan. No town, however peaceful, is ever what it appears to be on the surface. "

Most Tana French books have at least 10 sentences that are constructed so beautifully that I read said sentences over and over again. The Searcher didn't really have those. Instead it felt as if the whole book was one of those beautifully arranged sentences. The setting, the characters and the leisurely pace of the mystery equaled a ridiculously pleasurable reading experience.

My experiences of reading Tana French's work have varied from the very, very good (Broken Harbour, The Secret Place) to the underwhelming (The Witch/Wych Elm) to the inexplicably overrated (The Likeness). Having had mixed feelings about The Witch Elm, which like this book is a standalone, I wasn't necessarily expecting great things from The Searcher. On top of which, it just sounds really boring. Retired Chicago cop helping some kid find their missing brother in a small Irish village? Meh.So I was as surprised as anyone when I was quickly gripped by it. It's not the plot, not exactly: it really is just about a retired Chicago cop helping some kid find their missing brother in a small Irish village. (In someone else's hands it might be the perfect setup for a cosy crime series.) It's not the characters, either, as I never fully warmed to any of them. It's French's handling of the characters – and their surroundings – that brings magic to it. The tension simmering so soft and low you don't even notice it for a while; the exceptionally well developed bond between Cal and Trey; the beautiful menace of the wild countryside. It's not flashy, it's not twisty, and Cal is less memorable than many of French's protagonists. Yet I found myself struggling to put it down, reading hundreds of pages at a stretch. Rarely is a novel so quiet yet so compelling.I received an advance review copy of The Searcher from the publisher through NetGalley.TinyLetter | Linktree"

I didn't care about anybody at all, the whole thing felt phoned in, and it wasn't ever interesting. I was 80% done and was still waiting for it to be interesting.I also don't get all the reviews talking about how atmospheric it is. The setting! So vibrant! Yes, that's what made me fall in love with Tana French's books in general. I didn't get that from this book at all. I felt it was sorely missing. I skimmed the book before I read it and remember thinking, huh, that's a lot of dialogue. A lot of white space. But maybe I was remembering wrong -- and I still can't be bothered to go pull another book off my shelf to compare. Maybe I was remembering wrong, maybe I'm too used to reading on a Kindle, maybe it's just the appearance of it. No, it wasn't. It was really just a lot of conversation, not a lot of description, just skimming along at surface level without any deeper exposition or description or intrigue. I didn't like The Witch Elm much, but I liked the experience of reading The Witch Elm. It was a beautiful book, even if I hated everybody in it and the ending. The experience of it was what I expected. This one wasn't, at all."

Huge thank you to the Penguin and Viking team, for this amazing opportunity!
Synopsis:
Cal Hooper is a retired detective, and he moves to a remote village in rural Ireland. He’s fixing up this old house, and is getting used to this new mountain life, trying to forget about his previous profession of chasing criminals.That is, until one day, a kid comes to his door and asks for help. His brother is missing, and he knows something must’ve happened to him. But no one else in the village seems to care. Unable to leave this a mystery, Cal starts to ask questions.But the whole village seems like they don’t want new people messing up with whatever secrets they may have.
My Thoughts:
 The Searcher was a true slow burner. At times, it was even too slow for me, and I was struggling. However, I have never before read a book so well built, and despite the slow pace, I kept returning to it. This is my first book from Tana French, and I will definitely be reading more from her. I think the next one will be The Wych Elm, as I already have that one in my library. Tana French did such a good job at describing this rural village in Ireland, and its people. From the cold mountains, to the lovely cottage in need of renovating, to the pub and the people living in the village, it felt as if I was there. Even though I’ve never been to Ireland before.Cal Hooper was an intriguing character, and I loved his story. The reason he moved to the mountains, and the ongoing experiences helped me understand the issues he was facing, and I loved how he started to personally grow throughout the book, with Trey’s help. And as for Trey, I loved his personality too. The quiet, but also savage and arrogant character, that wasn’t afraid to be nosy. But also the innocent child that desperately wanted help and support, when they didn’t receive it before.The book was very dark and eerie throughout all times.And the people are savage and brutal, and you can feel this even when the conversations are about happy things. There was a certain eerie cloud surrounding this book, and I really loved that. I don’t think another book has made me feel this way before.As for the mystery, I feel that part was a bit weak. I loved the search itself, and the moments when Cal would try and dig deeper into what actually happened. But as any informal investigation, he couldn’t get too far. And the villagers didn’t try and help him too much. It was an interesting dynamic I really enjoyed. But the ending and the revelation weren’t too satisfying for me.The Searcher by Tana French is truly one of a kind. With its description, the rural scenery and brutality of the people, it’s one of those books that will give you slow chills down your spine."
64,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22727329-victoria,Rating 4 out of 5,"Slow burn of a novel with a slow burn realization.I usually shy from atmospheric storytelling, the plot buried in descriptive prose, but in French’s hands it serves the story well with an insidious darkness to this small town of seemingly affable Irish folk. Beware what’s beneath the veneer of joviality.French takes the outsider trope, adds a mysterious disappearance, a troubled kid, a provincial community and renders a finely honed, yet chilling story. While the ending didn’t quite sit well at first, the more I thought about it the more its malevolence seeped into my memory and the more I realized that, in that, it was brilliant.Creepy, nuanced and compelling, recommended for those that enjoy a slow build mystery with a literary intensity."
65,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5240149-brenda,Rating 4 out of 5,"Different than my usual read, but I enjoyed the change. As others have said, this is very atmospheric with strongly written characters, and the crime is mostly incidental."
66,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,Rating 4 out of 5,"I wasn’t sure that I’d like ‘The Searcher’ by Tana French. The first hundred pages were pure domestic fiction. In the second hundred, I had finally decided that the main character, retired Chicago cop Calvin “Cal” John Hooper, forty-eight-years-old, was very likeable. By the next hundred pages, I was enjoying the mystery. By the last two hundred pages, I couldn’t stop reading! The book is exceptionally well written. I have absolutely no complaints about the author’s beautiful, almost poetic, lyricism, especially when describing the woody countryside and the small Irish village of Ardnakelty. I copied part of the book blurb below as it is accurate:Cal Hooper thought a fixer-upper in a bucolic Irish village would be the perfect escape. After twenty-five years in the Chicago police force and a bruising divorce, he just wants to build a new life in a pretty spot with a good pub where nothing much happens. But when a local kid whose brother has gone missing arm-twists him into investigating, Cal uncovers layers of darkness beneath his picturesque retreat, and starts to realize that even small towns shelter dangerous secrets.The local kid, Trey Reddy, is such a wonderful character, a fierce Watson to Hooper’s reluctant Holmes, by the middle of the novel I found myself hoping author French would return to these two characters as a series! But ffs please please please move the plot along if there is a next time!"
67,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/93114967-barbara-k,Rating 3 out of 5,"French has made it clear that this book is her effort to write an updated Western, a genre she's recently come to enjoy, but one to which I have had limited exposure outside of movies. That's something to bear in mind when reading these comments. I'm no expert on Westerns, and my expectations for this book may have been inappropriate.Cal, a retired cop from Chicago with baggage from his work experiences and from his ex-wife, and with a grown daughter he doesn't understand, wants to start the next stage of his life in a quiet rural location. He buys a dilapidated cottage in a tiny community in western Ireland, a location seemingly perfect for his needs (all that scenery and good fishing to boot).My issues with this book start at this point, since I don't think we ever really got a good answer to the question, Why Ireland? Cal isn't of Irish heritage and there's nothing to indicate he's always been fascinated with the area or ever visited before. Indirectly we learn that he's happy to be away from Chicago winters, and at some point he observes wryly that he thought he was moving to an English speaking area but hadn't counted on the strong accents of the locals as an impediment to communications. Well enough, but I still find that it strains believability that he would purchase property in a location completely unknown to him based solely on an internet search. I guess it's a variation on that concept of saddling up your horse and riding out into the sunset to start over, but it didn't work for me.That question leads to another more critical one: Who is Cal? We learn scattered facts about him, but they didn't seem to add up to anything solid, to a person who captured my imagination. This was a disappointment to me since it's not been a problem with other characters in French's novels. For instance, I didn't much care for Toby in The Witch Elm, but by the end of the book I understood why I disliked him. I guess we're supposed to accept that Cal is an Everyman with a noble heart and a passion for the law, but for me it just didn't ring true. I've really struggled with this business of analyzing why Cal doesn't work, for me, as the quintessential Western hero. Maybe it's that he still wants desperately to maintain ties to his wife and daughter. He thinks about them constantly and calls them, the daughter especially, routinely. So that feeling of hero-as-loner never really clicks. It's not just that his past defines him - he can't let go of it in real time.The plot is reasonably good and gets its strength from French's evocations of the local culture, characters, climate and natural beauty. Cal is sought out by a 13 year old whose older brother has gone missing and who wants Cal to locate him. (Everyone in town knows that Cal is an ex-cop and thus ideally suited for this job.) People get in the way, as is normal with quests of this nature. Not much actually happens for most of the book. Cal, with help from the kid, works on fixing up his cottage, goes fishing and hunting rabbits, and watches the seasons change. And asks questions, many of which demonstrate his status as outsider to a closed culture. Things eventually come to a head with one solid action scene, and then the plot just kind of drifts away again. This review is probably coming across as a bit cranky and harsh, but I really expected something different. More energy, maybe, or a different resolution. I realize that my lack of enthusiasm stands in contrast to so many other reviewers, but alas, it is what it is.I may need to give French a break for a while. As much as I adored the Dublin Murder series, with her innovative plots and crisply drawn characters, these last two standalones have been disappointments."
68,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36511432-paul-e,Rating 4 out of 5,"A retired detective from the US, moves to a tiny little hamlet in Ireland to relax and reflect but becomes wrapped up in a mystery. I'm a little ambivalent about this one. Some of the plots in this story seem incomprehensible, which really leave you shaking your head. Now with all that said, Tana French's writing is so far superior in story telling that you just enjoy reading it anyway. And the attention to detail is very intelligent but not over loquacious or verbose. 4-4.5 stars."
69,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28604716-left-coast-justin,Rating 5 out of 5,"I had a bit of deja vu reading this; like Tim Winton's The Riders, this one began with a slow, atmospheric look at a man restoring an old abandoned cottage in the west of Ireland. Since joining Goodreads a few years back, it's fair to say that French and Winton are the two favorite authors that I've become acquainted with through this site. They are both so, so good at what they do...Winton seems like a guy I'd love to have a beer with. Tana French scares me, a little.Both of them describe flawed but relatable men very well. Our hero this time is a big bearded giant, lately retired from Chicago PD, looking for a place where he can lower his defenses a bit. Trouble arrives at his doorstep in the form of a semi-feral twelve-year-old kid, seeking answers to a local mystery. And in French's inimitable way, we're back in the world of corrosive distrust, meaningful kindnesses and a sad recognition that the world will always contain weak people with weapons who prey on strong people without. Part of my enjoyment of this was my dread feeling, before opening it, that I wouldn't enjoy it at all. I had heard that her post-Murder Squad output was weak, and I had already tried and failed to get interested in The Witch Elm. But she's back in fine form, x-raying people's minds:...He was running wild in Chicago, giddy on freedom, working as a bouncer at skeevy clubs and playing house with Donna...It was only a few years later, when they found out a baby was on the way, that he realized running wild never had suited him. It had been a lot of fun, but deep down, so deep that he'd never spotted it there, he yearned after getting his feet on the ground and doing right by someone.This describes about 80% of the men I know, and perhaps 0.5% of the men in modern fiction. How come Tana French can see what nobody else can?He remembers how he used to put his daughter's whole little baby foot in his mouth, and she'd laugh till she gave herself hiccups.This, my friends, is how to write a book about people, the most interesting creatures in the known universe."
70,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/103664948-lisa,Rating 4 out of 5,"Not as dark or tightly coiled as her previous works, French's The Searcher focuses much more on character development. With a host of complex characters, some of whom are both victim and perpetrator, and evil that is not always clearly delineated, this story held my attention from the start.Cal Hooper leaves the Chicago police department for what he thinks will be a peaceful early retirement in a small town in Western Ireland. He struggles to understand the local culture and tangled relationships and history. As he helps Trey, a 13 year old, search for an older brother he becomes unwittingly embroiled in town secrets.""He has no idea, not just what the people around him know and what they believe, but also what they might think of it, what they want, why they want it, or how they might go about achieving it. Their decades of familiarity, which seemed like a comfort at the beginning of last night, weave themselves into an impenetrable thicket; its layers obscure every action and every motivation till they're near indecipherable to an outsider. He understands that this effect is, at least in part deliberate and practiced. The guys like him blindfolded. It's not personal; keeping him that way is, to them, an elementary and natural precaution.""Cal grapples with his sense of right and wrong after years on the Chicago police force, and during the course of this story he is compelled to reexamine morality and the code he lives by.This novel is told in a deliberate and unhurried voice. French skillfully builds the relationship between Cal and Trey, includes beautifully rendered descriptions of the Western Ireland landscape, and tells an engrossing story with moral and ethical undertones."
71,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/721595-melissa-semi-hiatus-due-to-work,Rating 3 out of 5,"2.5 stars. Ultimately a decent book, but it takes So So So long to get there. And overall, the mystery isn't really a mystery, it's more of a character study of Cal and how his past and present choices affect him. I really enjoyed the Dublin Murder Squad series for the most part, they are intriguing mysteries with relatable characters. The Witch Elm was like this one--super slow, but once it got going I liked the mystery and how that one was laid out. The Searcher explores Cal's motivations and the way he ends up reacting to and treating Trey as compared to how he reacted to his own daughter's trauma years before. The overall story of Trey's missing brother isn't overly original or surprising at all, it's just a slow unfolding of a common story.I listened to this as an audio book and the narrator really personified Cal, which made me enjoy the book much more than I probably would have reading it on the page. I got a real sense of him and who he was through the narration.Overall, glad I read this because I do like this author, but it was disappointing and slow and probably not for all mystery fans."
72,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"My third Tana French and I want to read more. I like her storylines and characters, rich dialogue and great descriptive writing eg:Here, the first light spreads across the fields like something holy is happening, striking sparks off a million dewdrops and turning the spiderwebs on the hedge to rainbows; mist curls off the grass, and the first calls of birds and sheep seem to arc effortless miles. Story set in a fictional village in Western Ireland. Cal Hooper a retired US policeman buys a remote derelict house. Whilst decorating he meets a 13 year old called Trey who asks him to find a missing brother. This seemingly innocuous task leads Cal into danger. The good news is there a second book of this endearing character."
73,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6450088-tania,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5 stars. I have read and loved all of Tana French's books, and this standalone is no exception. I adore all things Irish, so you can imagine how much I enjoyed the rural Irish setting, the locals with their Irish vernacular and Irish customs - Sing Songs and poteen in the pub down the road. I also really liked Cal Hooper, a recently retired and divorced Chicago detective, who just bought a dilapidated house outside of the small Irish town, expecting to finally be able to just relax and enjoy the beautiful scenery. As our very likable protagonist soon finds out all is not as it seems, and the best laid plans often go awry. Although this is still not what you would call a fast-paced thriller, it definitely included more action than her 2018 offering, The Witch Elm. I would say this is now my fourth favorite book by Tana, with number one to three being: Faithful Place, Broken Harbor and In the Woods. The only reason this is not rate higher in the sequence is because I still miss the focus on the complex relationships of the detectives in The Dublin Murder Squad series. This is a must read if you enjoy literary thrillers, and The Searcher is definitely a contender for my favorite mystery for 2020."
74,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15055195-gary,Rating 4 out of 5,I loved 'The Dublin Murder' series by Tana French so I was really looking forward to this one. This stand alone book is a lot different to that series although just as gripping. This is a story of ex detective Cal Hooper who following his move to rural Ireland is looking for a complete life change. He plans to spend most of his time renovating a cottage that is need of urgent repairs. His well intended dreams are interrupted when a a local boy asks him to help find his missing brother. The family is far from liked by the locals and there is little urgency by anyone including the police to locate the brother. Cal feels the need to help and find trouble beckoning.This is not a fast paced thriller but a masterclass in storytelling with the author bringing the pages to life and making you feel like you can see the characters and scenery. This is excellent writing but not sure if it will be appreciated by lovers of fast paced thrillers.I would like to thank both Netgalley and Penguin UK for supplying a copy of this novel in exchange for an honest review.
75,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9693936-heidi,Rating 5 out of 5,"There is a reason why Tana French is one of my all-time favourite authors, and her books are on my most anticipated auto-buy list. And even though I am still hoping for another instalment in the Dublin Murder Squad series, this did not curtail my excitement on finding out that her new stand-alone novel is coming out later this year. I did a happy dance that sent the dog scurrying outside in fright when I received an ARC from Netgalley!Every one of Tana French’s books may be quite different from each other, both in characters and even writing style, but there hasn’t been a single one where I have not instantly felt transported into another world within a few paragraphs. THE SEARCHER was no exception. I would almost say that it was French’s most atmospheric book yet, but then I think of the claustrophobic housing development in BROKEN HARBOUR, or the rickety old mansion in THE LIKENESS, or the spooky forest of IN THE WOODS, and come to see that atmospheric settings are her forte! Let’s just say that I particularly liked this one, the small village somewhere in Ireland, surrounded by gently rolling green hills, forests and mountains, and so idyllic at first glance. This is exactly what has attracted retired American detective Cal Hooper to the area and motivated him to settle across the Atlantic in his newly purchased tumble down farmhouse. He just wants a quiet life, and this place promises exactly that. Until a raggedy teenager turns up on his doorstep, and Cal becomes embroiled in a mystery some people are prepared to keep hidden at all cost.Please note that THE SEARCHER is a slow-burning, character driven book that relies heavily on atmosphere and the things left unspoken to carry the story along. So if you are looking for fast-paced, you may be disappointed. However, if you – like me – love a story brimming with atmosphere and appreciate an undercurrent of menace and danger that is entirely being created by seemingly benign things, then you’re in luck! I enjoy nothing more than a small town setting that oozes intrigue and where everyone has something to hide. French recreates this setting so well! I also appreciate the way that each character in the book ultimately managed to surprise me as we got glimpses beneath the surface. There again we had that bittersweet feeling of melancholy that is another one of French’s hallmarks. Whether it is the dream of friendship and family (THE LIKENESS), or of a beautiful forever home (BROKEN HARBOUR), or this time a peaceful life and healing from a failed marriage – we can all relate to those at some level, can’t we? However, like life, French has other plans for her characters, and the expulsion from an imagined paradise leaves behind a slight taste of sadness. We know that life for our characters will never be the same after this, and will always carry the scars, and the echo of things that could have been.All in all, THE SEARCHER is the type of slow burning, atmospheric novel oozing with an undercurrent of menace and danger I have come to expect from the pen of Tana French. Grabbing me from page one, it didn’t let go until the very last page had been turned, and consumed my thoughts for quite some time after that. I enjoyed everything, from the rural Irish setting to its authentic characters and the mystery at the heart of the novel that threatens everything our main protagonist has hoped for when he moved here. I enjoyed every minute of it!Thank you to Netgalley and Penguin Group UK / Viking for the free electronic copy of this novel and for giving me the opportunity to provide an honest review. *blog*  *facebook*  *instagram* "

That's what that shift in the air meant, the one he and Trey both felt as they squatted by the sideboard, the cold implacable shift that's familiar to him from a hundred cases: this isn't going to have a happy ending. (PG 286)This was my first Tana French and definitely not the last. While it was a slow burn it wasn't boring me enough to stop. I liked the setting of the Irish village and the familiarity of the villagers to one another. This made it hard for Cal Hooper from Chicago, USA, to fit in. All he wanted was peace and quiet after his divorce and got himself into a missing persons case where even in a small town and everyone knows each other has secrets. Very atmospheric and slow. Maybe even a wee bit long but French shows what a great writer she is and knows how to give a character life on the pages."

79,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/94827108-allison-keith,Rating 5 out of 5,"Tana French books are reads I savor, and this literary mystery was exactly the story I needed. This story is not a fast-paced read, but it is a beautiful one filled with tense, sinister moments. The heart of this story is the microcosm of a small, rural village in Ireland retired Chicago police officer Cal has moved to. Villages like this exist everywhere, and the entangled, blurred lines of relationships and the ominous undercurrents of these places is brilliantly portrayed in this tale. Cal references a “code” in the story, and small communities certainly have them. Everyone knows each other’s secrets, and there is an unspoken oath guaranteeing those secrets are preserved. The mystery Cal delves into is a common one in tight communities, and while the unraveling of a young man’s disappearance takes the expected turns and is unsurprising at the reveal, it is incredibly, hauntingly fitting for this setting. And what a setting. I love this author’s penchant for lending physicality to the elements and painting a picture of the setting so vivid I feel as if I can step through the pages into that world. The brilliant characterizations, sly humour, revealing dialogue, and the lyrical, careful unfolding of the plot are simply perfection."

Cal Hooper, a former dedicated detective on the Chicago Police Department, retired after a professional incident involving his partner, as well as personal upheaval when he and his wife divorced. Just wanting to begin again, he bought a fixer-upper in a remote village in Ireland. But a young local kid comes seeking Cal's help. It is through the lens of this relationship with Trey that we see the layers of complicity in this small Irish village and also the depth of the caring between this former Chicago cop and this young villager as they strive to learn the truth. This was a wonderful book that builds slowly but keeps one's interest throughout.

83,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9945170-georg,Rating 1 out of 5,"If you're looking for a textbook on the autumn weather around Galway, Ireland, then I can only recommend Tana French's ""The Searcher"". About one third of the book is about rain, sunlight color, forest, trees, animals in forest, animals in trees, rivers, animals in rivers, as well as mountains, grass, clouds and wind. An endless resource for the interested reader. The rest of the book is a collection of crime clichés which are put together in a way that makes an easy and towards the end even a bit thrilling read. The beginning is very slow. The main character is a wonderful white ex-Chicago police man who for no good reason decided to leave his grown up daughter and ex wife behind and move to Ireland. He loves American highways, but he chose Ireland. We don't know why. It makes no sense. He is a good man. He is so good, that he constantly struggles with ""what is the right thing to do"", but then he anyhow does things and all the struggling is pretty pointless and gets a bit boring after the third round. He also acts against the law several times, but hey - he was a cop and he is a good guy! And anyhow, all this doesn't make us feel more with him or let us see a real character development. He is a great guy in the beginning, he is a great guy in the end. The story is predictable - even when we don't know what it is all about it is pretty clear that the friendly neighbor is deeply involved, as everything points away from him. Why Tana French decided to write from the perspective of a man rather than a woman is not clear to me. It never is when authors chose the other gender for the main character. Why? Cal doesn't feel like a guy, he stays a construct, a fictional plain character. It doesn't help the book that for no good reason it includes two pages in which Cal lays out why he thinks political correctness is the wrong path and that people who discuss about such lingual details are those who never help the ones who need support. So Tana French transports to us the message that words have no real impact and those who take care of words are imposters. Pretty daring for an author. So, it is an easy read, entertaining, but it offers in the end nothing new, nothing remarkable or worth remembering. I have not read anything else from Tana French, but the book gives the impression that is was written due to the publisher waiting for the next novel from the author. "

My wife got me this for Christmas whatever year it came out and I've been figuratively sitting on it ever since.Sadly, this was more like the Witch Elm. It's a slow burn, emphasis on the slow. Seriously, a snail would want French to speed things up a bit. The book is 450 pages long and Cal makes fuck all progress on the disappearance of Brendan Reddy for over half the book. The setup is interesting enough, missing sibling plus weird sheep mutilation. The problem is French took the longest possible path to the most unsatisfying conclusion to the mystery.

As this is the first book by Tana French starring an American police officer, I was concerned how that fact might work into the narrative and themes. The subsequent disappointment was, in part, my fault.Spoilers ahead, don’t bother reading this review unless you’ve read the book or don’t mind spoilers.When I began reading French’s Dublin Murder Squad I bought into an idealistic fantasy. Living in the United States, I was ignorant to any of the details of policing in Ireland. Consequently, I constructed a naive conception of Irish police. In this world a detective would put ethics and decency over a successful outcome to a case. Dishonesty was not allowed under any circumstances. Complicated issues of race, gender, class, and power were swept under the rug in exchange for psychological and interpersonal conflicts. As progressive and left-wing as I am, I still ended up buying into this illusion. I bought the illusion in part because I made the assumption that Irish cops would somehow be better than the atrocious police in the United States. This idealism doesn’t take away from novels like In the Woods and The Likeness which I still love. But as I reached the third and forth installments of the series something uncomfortable began to creep in. Something not only uncomfortable, but familiar. In these novels a well-worn police drama cliche emerged. Now the detectives would follow rules and make ethical considerations...well, unless they needed to “catch the bad guys.” Police could now break laws as long as the end justified the means. Who was in charge of determining what a just end was? The police themselves of course. At this point I began to feel disheartened with the series. The stories were alright and the characters were detailed and complex. But the use of old cliches felt lazy. That was until I read The Witch Elm. This stand-alone novel flipped the script. Police were no longer the heroes. We followed a suspect and watched the way police engaged in manipulation to achieve their ends. After enjoying this novel immensely, I was excited for The Searcher. As you will see, I was not pleased with the result.CopagandaI think it is important to define this term. Copaganda is media, either news or entertainment, that presents a rosy image of policing, much like my escapist vision of Ireland. These portrayals are meant to influence public opinion of police and discourage criticism. Some of these portrayals incorporate right-wing talking points like the “it’s a difficult job” narrative.To be clear, I am fine with characters in novels having wildly different opinions and paradigms than mine. In Broken Harbor, the protagonist Scorcher, is a moral essentialist. He thinks humanity consists of heroes in badges and criminals in track suits battling over civilization. I vehemently reject this viewpoint, but I have no issue —and actually find it interesting— to read a book from the perspective of a character like this. Regardless of a character’s viewpoint, it is always entertaining to see how a character reconciles with or rejects the world around them based on their perspectives.However, in countless American television shows, novels, and movies, the cops break the rules to “save the day.” If they brutalize the suspect, it’s only to save a bunch of little kids. If they lie, it’s because they have no choice. In this world, ethics, bureaucracy, and justice are hindrances set up so that cops will fail and the bad guys will get away. If an innocent person dies along the way “it’s because the cops tried to do the right thing.” In these sorts of narratives, it’s not about a simplistic viewpoint existing in a complex world, but a series of situations contrived to reinforce that simplistic worldview. This technique is so pervasive that it is difficult to differentiate between fact and fiction —which of course is the point of copaganda, whether implicit or not. Consumers of this sort of media build a parapsychological relationship with the police characters and the idea of policing in fiction further divorces itself from reality. I don’t exclude myself from this. We never saw characters in In the Woods performing traffic stops. They were just out there to solve the brutal murder of a child.To bring this all back to The Searcher, Cal becomes disillusioned with being a police officer. This could be a promising plot. However, we learn that Cal’s disillusionment doesn’t stem from Cal’s own ethical debates, but with how complex the world is. Even in trying to describe this complex world, Cal relies on reductionist terms. Widespread racism gets boiled down to the simplistic sentence “black people were tired of being treated like crap.” There is the old copaganda favorite: good cops hate bad cops for making them look bad. This begs the question of why Cal, presumably a good cop, never attempts to make this better. Perhaps that would be too complicated. All he needs is a trip to the Irish country-side where good guys are good and bad guys wear track suits. The most egregious moment of copaganda in the entire novel is a flashback that Cal has. In this flashback, Cal and his partner are chasing a black man. Cal’s partner shoots at the unarmed man. Now this could be a scenario that could be unpacked and analyzed. But once again, that might make things too complicated. Also this novel has no intention of making things too complicated because then people might become critical of the police.The scene is presented solely from the perspective of the police. We are shown how torn up the cop is for firing his gun at a suspect and not shown how the man who was almost shot feels. The problem is that the entire scenario is presented as a mistake anyone can make (with the subtext being, “especially if you have such a hard job”). The scene is presented in a way that leaves the door open for victim blaming. Simultaneously, criticism and protest against the police is meant to look like an over-reaction to human error. We experience the cop’s pain, not the pain of the oppressed. The cop is presented as an overall good person who would never dream of being racist. This reduces an entire complex system down to random mistakes. Complexity seems to be the villain in this novel. There is even a straw-man liberal character who seems to only be included in the book to garner a response like “lIbUrALs aM i rUgHt? tHeY gEt sO ofFeNdED.” Instead of the usual emotional and intellectual depth of Tana French novels, we’re presented with the idea that the world just doesn’t understand Cal’s extreme reasonableness. MasculinityIt seems fitting that this would be another major issue with this novel. It’s so interlinked with the uncritical acceptance of all things cop. After all they have guns and can shoot things. There is a mind-numbingly tedious scene where Cal show a teenager how to shoot a gun. I’m not automatically anti-gun, I just found the scene to be a low effort attempt to give the novel a True Grit feel. After all, what seems to make Cal a “moral” protagonist is his own personal choices as to when to use force. Cal isn’t depicted as just or ethical, he just is a white-dude-cop with a gun and since we’ve seen this character presented again and again as the “good guy” in entertainment, the book doesn’t bother to justify Cal.The scene that best exemplifies this is when Cal tortures a suspect for information. He bashes the guy’s hand in a dresser and interrogates him. Of course since the guy is generic track-suit-wearing bad guy, we aren’t supposed to question if this is something Cal should be doing. After getting the information he needs, Cal criticizes how messy his victim’s room is. This gross portrayal of force as a necessary paternal action to correct deviance is perhaps one of the clearest examples of toxic masculinity I’ve read in a book this year. What are Cal’s qualifications to meter out punishment? He’s a white-dude-cop with a gun. This novel is filled from beginning to end with a rugged/non-empathetic/unfriendly/violent masculinity. I’m honestly tired of dude-bro books. This didn’t do anything new with the concept and certainly didn’t analyze or present gender in any meaningful way. This was far from a mirror held to society. The overall message of the novel isn’t that Cal should adapt to a changing world, but that Cal’s masculinity should be coddled by the world. Cal should be able to run around and play cops and robbers with other people’s lives.ConclusionI could go on about this book until I ran out of room on Goodreads, but it’s exhausting. I know this is fiction, but these are the sorts of things I think about when I read fiction. I think to pretend that a book is only entertainment is a disservice to fiction. I feel exhausted by this sort of book because it’s the same old reinforcement to a reductionist worldview. Viewing policing one way or another isn’t opinion, it’s connected to ideology. An opinion question might be “which Dublin Murder Squad book is your favorite?” An ideological question might be “how complicated do you think the world is?”"

Let me simply say that the main character is completely unconvincing as a former Chicago detective—none of his personal details rang true and his language was coarse and illiterate. The failure of the book seems due less to the author's lack of talent—indeed, the plot was well managed and the rural setting seemed authentic, which explains three stars—than based on an idea that simply did not work—a boorish stereotypical Ugly American blundering about in an Irish village. After the Wych Elm (mistitled Witch Elm in the USA), I'm wondering if Tana French can regain the form she displayed in The Likeness and The Secret Place. I really hope so."

92,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15583553-aditya,Rating 4 out of 5,"French has been writing literary mysteries where character is more important than plot forever. In her last two standalones, she is just taking her writing philosophy to the next level. As she matures as a writer, it is evident she wants to write drama rather than genre fiction. I don't know if this is an interesting detour or a permanent change in direction but I applaud her ambition.Don't go in expecting a mystery because you will be disappointed. As a crime book, it is mediocre. Retired Chicago PD cop Cal Hooper moves to an Irish village in the middle of nowhere to enjoy retirement. Instead he is enlisted by a 12 year old kid Trey Reddy to find a missing family member. The begining is too long, at points getting into Stephen King levels of self indulgence, the ending is anticlimactic. Cal faces a fish out of water situation and does not understand the culture. To drive home those points, French shows how his handling of suspects is inept. It rings true but a significant casualty are the brilliant interrogation scenes that defined the Dublin Murder Squad books. They go completely missing here.But then it is not fair to judge The Searcher as a mystery. The plot might concern a missing person case but the narrative is completely different. The plot and narrative being at loggerheads is not really a feature of crime fiction which is why I again reiterate don't go in expecting a regular police procedural. French's main thematic focus here is how people can't run away from who they are. Her character work has been consistently excellent and she digs deep into Cal Hooper too. Cal is not honest with himself or maybe even unsure at the start of the story about what sort of a man he wants to be. His uncertainty about how much he is willing to compromise is interesting. He slowly rediscovers his moral code which is not ever absolute, I found that journey authentic.The beating heart of the book is the relationship between Cal and Trey. Cal goes from a bored man indulging childish whims to surrogate father to Trey. French also captures the hostility that close-knit towns demonstrate towards outsiders. Other crime authors notably Jane Harper has tried dealing with same subtext and failed miserably. She made small town people seem stupid and mean but French understands how the salt of the earth appeal hides subtle prejudices. The sense of place always a defining feature of French's prose is as strong as ever.The Searcher is still nowhere close to being French's best. It has some problems even when judged as a drama. The third person narration instead of French's usual first person writing makes Cal seem distant in the first half. The languid pace will have its fair share of detractors. The verbosity is a genuine bother stripping the story of narrative momentum for the most part. It is even slower than her last book The Witch Elm, another one I liked that got criticized a lot for its pacing.I liked the characters and the character development but did not really care about the mystery. So if you are still wondering if as a fan of French's mysteries you should take the plunge, I have this last bit of advice. French essentially writes whydunits except the 'Why' this time does not concern the crime. It explains Cal's actions, why he goes from being confused about his own beliefs to standing up for them. If that sounds too character driven, it probably is. 3.5 gets bumped to 4/5."

When a local boy goes missing, his younger brother gets Cal to investigate. But he doesn’t have police resources & he’s new to town and American so he has to go about it solely using his wits.

Having purchased a dilapidated cottage he plans to fix-up, he looks forward to passing the time with a mixture of DIY and walks in the scenic mountains surrounding the small community but above all else, he's hoping to put his old police instincts to bed forever. After twenty-five years in the Chicago police force and a bruising divorce, he just wants to build a new life in a pretty spot with a good pub where nothing much happens. But when a local kid whose brother has gone missing arm-twists him into investigating, and no-one in the village, least of all the police, seems to care, Cal, once again feels that restless itch. No-one is more shocked than Cal himself when he uncovers layers of darkness beneath his picturesque retreat, and starts to realise that even small towns shelter dangerous secrets. The gut instinct he's relied on for his entire career is telling him something is wrong in this community, and he must find out what, even if it brings trouble to his door. This is a riveting, compelling and exciting standalone crime novel from one of the greatest writers in the genre today. It is an intelligent, multilayered mystery that is gripping and held my interest from first page to last. As always, the writing is superb and draws you in from the outset, the characters believable and real, and the plot action-packed whilst packing an emotional punch. French pays attention to subtle details that many authors would neglect and the stunning, atmospheric location, a character in itself, is portrayed magnificently adding to the sinister foreboding that hangs over the village like a dark cloud. It's a slow burner and written in French's flowing prose which makes it such an easy book to read and lose yourself in. This is a crime writer who knows exactly how to pull the wool over readers' eyes time and time again and who can be trusted to have you on the edge of your seat, making guesses at those behind the crimes but each time she somehow manages to fool you. It's a highly entertaining, masterful and utterly engrossing read. All in all, this is an intense, disquieting and superbly woven tale of suspense, asking what we sacrifice in our search for truth and justice, and what we risk if we don't. Many thanks to Viking for an ARC."

(No regrets though-she is adorable!) But anyway so this is gonna be quick and dirty: This was a super slow burn. Like suuuuppperr slow. And normally that’s fine with me because French does atmosphere and the stab the heart lines so well I don’t even notice. But this time I found this world too starkly... well just stark in all ways, I guess, to not notice. And the secrets and lies of the late middle age masculine rural world were not as compelling to me as other settings and internecine cliquey squabbles have been. This was a crack at the “stranger comes to live in small isolated village,” genre that actively tried to avoid the tropes of that- I’ll give it that. (Though not enough for it not to be about an American fixing up a house in a foreign country for feelings reasons. :)) French did throw in a very determined little girl I think to try to alleviate some of the things I’ve named above, but there was too much caution from the MC about getting to know her, for reasons which in real life I would applaud, but which in fiction make for harder going in terms of connection. Also takes away one of French’s great gifts- the inner lives and secret worlds of people trying to reach and maintain adulthood. My least favorite French so far, sadly. The only one I would say I found somewhat forgettable. Go read the first three Dublin Murder books instead. They’ll knock your socks off."
97,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1343864-ashley,Rating 5 out of 5,"This was slower paced and less twisty turny than her other books but I loved that about it. I liked her last book, The Witch Elm, but I loved this one. This is also a character study as well as a mystery/crime novel (that isn't part of her Dublin Murder series), but here the protagonist is a former cop from Chicago who retired and decided to try and find peace in the Irish countryside. He bought a beaten down farmhouse and has spent a lot of time trying to fix it up, and he still has a long ways to go. We join Cal when he has been there a couple of months, just long enough to become somewhat familiar with the locals and their customs, enough to know that he doesn't know hardly anything about his new home or its inhabitants. The plot slowly gains speed as we learn about Cal and his new town of Ardnakelty, and as a stray kid shows up at Cal's house and asks Cal to find his missing brother. The kid, Trey, is convinced that the brother, Brendan, has been kidnapped by someone, even though everyone in town believes that Brendan has just taken off for the city for one reason or another. There's a lot of inner conflict here. Cal left behind his job and his country to try and reckon with his own mind, and there is a LOT in here about Cal contemplating his old career and what it did to him. It's kind of uncanny that this was published now when French must have written it long before summer 2020 and all the media coverage of police brutality in the US exploded because of the murder of George Floyd. Cal isn't a 100% good guy, and one of the reasons he left the force is that he felt that he could no longer trust himself to always know what the right thing was, let alone to do it, no matter the reason (though it's heavily implied the job had some consequences for him). French plays with Western tropes all throughout this novel, and Cal is very much in the mold of the quiet man, the stoic loner come to the wilderness to get away from himself and the world. One of the things that French gets to play with here in having an ex-cop be her protagonist instead of a current one, is that she can play a lot more with shades of grey. It allows her to explore Cal's feelings about his moral code, about the job, and about what it did to him with a freedom that a character who's still in the trenches doesn't have. I'm not sure how anyone could interpret this book as ""pro-cop,"" although I've seen stray comments over the past month. This puzzles me. I want to visit their reviews and tell them to brush up on their reading comprehension. For me, this book reads like French reconsidering her choice to portray cops in such a heroic, if flawed, light for six books, not to say that she is now anti-cop, either, just that a new perspective from her comes in here. If anything, she's just pro-human, and always interested in exploring the psychology of any given situation. Cal's inner monologue heavily implies that being on the job in Chicago, the things he was asked to do and justify, fucked him up. He outright states that he no longer trusts his own moral code, and he proves this to us by engaging in illegal activity in pursuit of this case, and not calling the cops himself when he finds out who the killers are. His goal is not to seek out justice for Brendan's murder, but to provide peace of mind for his sister, Trey, (a twist I really liked), and this in itself shows that he no longer believes that the legal system is able to provide the right kind of answers in all situations. (The only cop we actually meet in the book, unless you count Cal remembering his partner almost killing someone on the streets of Chicago, is portrayed as likably hapless and ineffective.)I think, ultimately, French is interested in bringing nuance into everything she writes about, and she very much succeeds here. I was extremely satisfied by the ending of this book, and where the characters all end up, and I held such affection for three of them in particular (Cal and Trey among those three). If you go in to this book expecting something more slow and considered, you might come out of if liking it as much as I did."

99,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4692637-fleurette,Rating 3 out of 5,"This is my first book by this author about which I have heard a lot of good things. And while it wasn't totally awful experience, I'm a bit disappointed. I think this is not my last book by this author, but I also hope that her other books will be more to my taste.Most of all, I like when books have a much faster pace. The pace here is quite slow. Which was a problem, especially at the beginning, when I waited for the plot from the blurb to begin. Instead, there is really not much going on in the first three or four chapters. The author uses them to set the scene. I admit that I was getting impatient.Overall, I think this book is too long. Although maybe that’s not the core of the problem. The problem is the plot. As for 450 pages, the plot is quite simple. Nothing would have happened if this book was 100 pages shorter, there really isn't enough plotline to stretch it out over the extra 100 pages. If you expect surprising twists, you will not find them here. Everything goes on a rather well-known track and is what it looks like. There are no major surprises. Or maybe just all the twists are written in such a way that we are not surprised at all. As a result, the whole story seems simple and flat. Unfortunately, there is also nothing that would stay in your memory and that would allow you to easily recall this book in some time. And on 450 pages, there was enough room for something like this to appear.Even the ending doesn't make it any better. The ending, like the whole story, is also a bit weak. It is devoid of a strong accent, I think I would prefer something dramatic at the end. Now that I've done 450 pages of not-so-thrilling plot, I would like to remember the ending at least, but as it is I doubt if I remember how this book ended. The ending is more like fade to black rather than a strong blow. Okay, that fits the tone of the book, but again makes this book hard to remember.Unfortunately, even the main character does not save the situation. Cal is fine and has some potential as a main character, but unfortunately there's nothing fancy about him either. This is not someone I will remember. There are actually some more interesting supporting characters here, but with the simplicity of the story, even they didn't have a good opportunity to shine.It's not a bad story, quite the contrary. The story is okay, it's just a little too simple and too ordinary. This is the main problem of this book, there is nothing you will remember about it - some interesting idea, a surprising twist, a strong hero. There is, however, the atmosphere of a small town where maybe something bad is going on. If you are looking for an atmosphere of mystery rather than a surprising plot in your books, you may like this one. Unfortunately it doesn't work for me. It's good that I am writing this review the day after reading the book, because in two days the details of this story will begin to blur from my mind. I'm giving this one 3.5 stars.But the cover is beautiful. And it reflects the atmosphere of this story quite well."
100,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15962370-sarah,Rating 4 out of 5,"The Searcher is quite different from Tana French's more action-packed Dublin Murder Squad series. It's more of a slow-burn psychological drama/mystery, and is at least as much character- as plot-based. I really enjoyed reading it.Retired Chicago detective Calvin (Cal) Hooper has bought a run-down rural property near the (fictional) village of Ardnakelty in western Eire (Ireland), and is in the process of restoring it to a habitable state. He has begun to make acquaintance with several of the local farmers, and often enjoys a drink at the local public house. Ever the detective, Cal realises that someone's hanging around his property and covertly observing him, and one day he manages to flush out local 13-year-old, Trey Reddy, and slowly begins to gain the child's trust. It transpires that Trey's older brother, Brendan, disappeared without trace several months previously, and Trey is desperate for Cal's help in trying to find out what's happened to him. Has he simply left his poverty-stricken family behind, to seek work in Dublin or England, or has something more sinister befallen him? Reluctant at first, Cal is gradually dragged into the search for Brendan, despite frequent warnings from friends and strangers, some violent, to leave the matter alone.Tana French's writing evokes the beauty of the natural landscape of rural Ireland, as well as the day-to-day struggles faced by many who live there. The characters of Cal and Trey are well-developed and multi-faceted and there's a strong and varied cast of supporting characters. Underpinning the unfolding drama is Cal's sense of isolation and not knowing who to trust, as a newcomer to a place where everyone knows everyone else's business, often for generations back. Enmities and alliances run deep and are not always evident on the surface. I found the developing understanding between Cal and Trey, who have both become prickly ""loners"" for their own reasons, fascinating and heart-warming.The Searcher is an engrossing and beguiling novel, and well worth the read for those who enjoy a more literary style of character-driven crime drama or mystery.My thanks to the author, publisher Penguin UK and NetGalley for the opportunity to read and review this title."

I am a big fan of character-driven novels that provide readers with a personal glimpse of the character's life and personality. I found the characters were so very likable, so believable, and dynamic that they became more like friends. I loved the resiliency of Trey, and Cal's stubborn and unrelenting desire to live his life in what he felt was the acceptable standard. I enjoyed the interaction between these characters so much. This is hands down going to be one of my favorite books of all time. The plot was rich in so many ways and I found the descriptions of the region (Western Ireland) to be wonderfully written. I am never a fan of novels that drag on and on, but I found the pace here relaxing and it helped me to ENJOY the story. Cal is a retired Chicago Police Officer who has experienced divorce and a slight estrangement from his adult daughter. While attempting to come to grips with these difficult life-changing events he moves around the world and starts his life over hoping for a slower pace and a more rural life. He begins making friends with his neighbors who are clannish, but open enough so that he doesn't feel completely alone. Then he meets a local child who is the child of a ""waster"" and a sib to an older brother on track to join other young men in town who can only be described in that manner. The child, a 13-year-old is concerned about the location of his brother who disappeared six months before and has not been heard of since. Unable to turn down the child who often seems in desperate straits Cal takes up the case and asks questions. But he uncovers secrets and disturbs the peace of the community. WOW, what a book. 5 starsHappy Reading!"

He keeps to himself mostly: working on his house, walking to the pub occassionally, and calling his daughter routinely though he feels he doesn’t have much to say. The only involvement he really has with the village is friendly chats with his closest neighbor Mart and a few jokes with the guys at the pub.Then young Trey Reddy shows up around Cal’s place. Cal is hesitant to have a kid around and even more so when he realizes that Trey knows about his career and is looking for help. Trey’s older brother Brendan disappeared six months ago and it seems that no one cares. In the small village, teens are known to leave as soon as they can and the Reddy family isn’t known for being an upstanding family.Drawn in by Trey’s insistence that Brendan would never leave without a word, Cal’s casual questions around the village uncovers secrets he didn’t want to learn.French’s previous novel The Witch Elm was a frustratingly sloooooow burn for me that I never found myself invested in. I’m thrilled that The Searcher is a slow burn that I couldn’t put down! French is a master of character development; there are so many carefully crafted layers to each character which gives intimate insight into their relationships with each other. These nuances create an emotional impact that makes me even more invested in the mystery. The rich atmospheric details planted me firmly in this small town and I didn’t want to leave!I highly recommend The Searcher to readers who enjoy contemporary mystery/crime fiction.For more reviews, visit www.rootsandreads.wordpress.com"

I'm a big fan of Tana French's work and in this standalone, her characters are as wonderfully complex as always. Ms. French is incredibly skilled in capturing the teenage voice. Trey is a remarkable character, and I was invested in this kid from the start. Normally, any novel by Ms. French is a 4 or 5 star for me, but there were issues with Cal, the American protag, that I couldn't get past. There was no reason for a retired cop from Chicago to buy a house in the Irish countryside. Cal had no ties to Ireland. No family. Nothing. I couldn't buy in that he'd retire to a different country without some connection to that country. The other thing that took me out of the narrative was his occasional use of outdated, country bumpkin expressions. I can't imagine too many Chicago cops say, ""I reckon"" on a regular basis. I expected Cal to be street-smart and a bit jaded, and he seemed to waver between this character and Charles Ingalls. Despite these inconsistencies, I was quite taken with Cal's devotion to his code and seeing the development of his relationship with Trey."

106,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8104446-carol,Rating 5 out of 5,"Our main character is Cal Hooper originally from North Carolina but has spent the last 30 years in Chicago with the Chicago Police. At this time in his life, he's searching for something much different. He says he wants “A small place...a small town...in a small country”. He sells his house, collects his retirement, says good-bye to his friends, and moves to Ireland. His daughter is now an adult, his wife has left him, so Cal is on his own...that is until a kid named Trey starts hanging around. Trey’s brother, Brendan, is missing. Everyone believes that Brendan has run off like his father did, but Trey thinks there’s more to the story than just another young guy leaving his family behind in search of money and excitement in the city. Trey wants the police detective who just emigrated from America, to find out what’s really happened to Brendan. Cal is interested and tempted, but he's a new arrival to a small, tight-knit community, so he’s cautious and unsure how he feels about discovering that he hasn't left crime and violence behind when he left Chicago and his police life. I liked the ""Cal"" character. He's complex just enough to be interesting, and he doesn't just jump in headfirst to solve this mystery. As it turns out the mystery, he’s decided to try to solve is less shocking than what he actually discovers. I liked the ""slowness"" of the story. It's neither fast-paced nor action-packed, and it has as much to do with Cal’s personal life as it does with finding Brendan. There is some action, but it's mainly in the last third of the story. The only thing that I found about the book that might bother some folks is the morally ambiguous ending. Overall, the author delivers plenty of twists, some shocking revelations, and some truly chilling moments. It's a story with several delicious layers of intrigue. Mystery fans that are willing to ""wait for it"", will probably like this one."
107,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4728718-algernon-darth-anyan,Rating 4 out of 5," Landscape is one of the few things he knows of where the reality doesn’t let you down. The West of Ireland looked beautiful on the internet; from right smack in the middle of it, it looks even better. The air is rich as fruitcake, like you should do more with it than just breathe it; bite off a big mouthful, maybe, or rub handfuls of it over your face. Cal Hooper is a burnout Chicago cop. Fed up with the job and with the sort of policing his department enforces, estranged from his former wife and daughter, Cal decides to cash in his pension and move into an abandoned house in the middle of nowhere, crossing the Atlantic to land in a small village on the West coast of Ireland.Cal likes to work with his hands, rebuilding the house and enjoying the peace and quiet, most of the time. Like other lead characters from Tana French, Cal has a dark past that still haunts him and he keeps most of his problems bottled up inside. The neighbours generally leave him to his own devices, except for an old man who passes daily to chat and the general store manager, who is the local matchmaker and has an unmarried sister.A young kid named Trey has some plans to bring Cal back into the game of cops and robbers, nagging at the reclusive stranger in their midst to help find his missing older brother  Trey is actually a girl with very short hair, something Cal fails to notice, despite a whole career in law enforcement that supposedly taught him to pay attention to witnesses. This is just a minor complaint in an otherwise well plotted story. This is the kind of story that works well if the reader comes to it with a fresh mind, uncluttered by spoilers or misguided expectations. Nevertheless, I found the plot very similar to “Winter’s Bone” by Daniel Woodrell, mostly because it deals with a closely knit traditional community that likes to deal with its own problems without involving outsiders, police included. There’s also the young kid who is stubbornly searching for a family member, despite being warned that it will lead to major trouble.I mentioned Woodrell also because there are major differences in style between him and French: one is a minimalist who cuts the story down to its bare bones letting action determine the emotion and the motivation of his characters, the other is willing to slow the pace down and give herself and the reader enough time to absorb the atmosphere and to get to know the actors intimately. I believe the end results validate both approaches, making me think the talent of the author in question is the determining factor and not the number of actual pages. In Cal’s view, morals involve something more than terminology. This is a stand-alone novel, unconnected in any way to the Dublin Murder Squad series. Yet there is a thematic continuity with other books written by the same author, a feeling of familiarity given by the sort of issues put in discussion: the conflict between the rigidity of the written law and the wildness of the human heart. Instead of heroes and villains we are offered real, fallible human beings.Cal and Trey search together for the truth behind the hard-scrabble, boring life of the villagers, putting themselves in harm’s way to reveal the dark secrets that could shatter the fragile status quo. Tana French somehow manages to introduce some lighter moments into this terrible story (alien visitors attacking the local sheep?), and even a discreet, tentative romantic angle for Cal, but the hard core of the story revolves around the question of how to deal with a crime. “Morals,” he says in the end, “is the stuff that doesn’t change. The stuff you do no matter what other people do. Like, if someone’s an asshole to you, you might not be mannerly to him; you might tell him to go f_ck himself, or even punch him in the face. But if you see him trapped in a burning car, you’re still gonna open the door and pull him out. However much of an asshole he is. That’s your morals.” I’m being deliberately vague, because I think the reader is supposed to become a sort of juror in this case where there are no evident good options, decide who is guilty and who is innocent once he or she factors in all the clues and revelations.  I did like this novel better than ‘The Witch Elm’, the other stand-alone from Tana French, mostly because Cal is a straight shooter and a sort of white hat Western cowboy hero instead of a basket case egotist like Toby  “I just try to do right by people,” Cal says. “Is all” Recommended, either as an introduction to Tana French, or a time filler until the next Dublin Murder Squad book is published."
108,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5837456-susan,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is a slow and meandering mystery, which features Cal Hooper, a retired Chicago Police Detective. After finding his job too stressful, especially after his marriage broke down; Cal has made a move not just to leave the police, but to leave the country, and has relocated to West Ireland. Now he spends his day fixing up his remote house, chatting to his neighbour, occasionally heading to the local pub and enjoying not being responsible for the minor misdemeanors that may happen in the area. However, although Cal enjoys his feeling of irresponsibility, life is about to become a little more complicated when a local boy starts to drop by. Trey is thirteen and comes from a local family who are viewed as troublesome by the locals. At first, Trey doesn't state why exactly he has started to linger around the property, but it soon becomes obvious that he is aware Cal was in the police and he thinks that he can help him trace his missing brother. Although Cal is not keen to get involved, he reluctantly agrees to help and tries to uncover what happened.This is not a typical mystery and is far more about the characters than anything else. I liked the writing and enjoyed getting to know the people of Ardnakelty. Just be aware that, although this has a good sense of place and character, it is not a book to be hurried and you just need to relax and enjoy getting to know the people and their backgrounds. I received a copy of this book from the publishers, via NetGalley, for review. "

There is another book coming in a few months, seems to be a direct sequel to this, so very good timing all round. I am definitely getting that as soon as I can - and it will be fun to read a Tana French novel at publication date. Throughout her books, there is this concern, sharp observation of larger social trends and how they influence people (and influence people to do mean things to others) which feels so timely - reading her books by chronological order, from 2006 publication to 2020 publication it has been a particular pleasure.So, this Searcher, an american retired cop moving to a small irish community, in the west of Ireland. I heard it called a western and it is very much (though I am not sure I would have spotted it myself), the outside looking in, the concern with morals and the right thing. Fantastic character build, and deeply thought about what ails small rural towns (in Ireland but also elsewhere) and big urban centers (in America but also elsewhere) and masculinity in general. Really special. It's arguably not really a mystery novel, though there is a functional one but then again Tana French is her own genre, by my accounting.It needs a sequel IMO, and I am very happy we will getting it.Incidentally, like with every other book of hers the audiobook is excellent. This time there was a change in style, for the first time, the narrative is third person and not first person, but it is very close also and fits so well into being read by a good actor. And the actor doing the narration, Roger Clark is very good indeed. I can not tell if his american (North Carolina supposedly) or irish accents (western ireland, somewhere) are accurate to the regions they are meant to be, but they are consistent throughout the book and sound natural - and some of those pub dialogues are just priceless"

There is everything here to love, good plot, great pace, realistic and interesting characters, reveals and twists and a cracking ending. Perfection in a book. I was lost in this from start to finish and honestly didn't want it to end. Beautifully written, suspenseful and mysterious. Tara has told a story that makes everyone question what is the fine line between right and wrong. This will keep you guessing. It threw up plenty of surprises along the way for me. I was totally thrown off and had a few jaw-drop moments with certain reveals. Carl Hooper is retired from 25 years in the Chicago Police Force and has bought a run down house in a small Irish village with plans to renovate and live a quiet life. Sometimes plans don't work out as you expect. Carl gets to know the locals in this very close community and is slowly accepted with his warm personality but not everyone is happy he is in town. When a young kid desperately asks Carl to help find his older missing brother Carl is torn. He thought his detective days were well behind him. This kid won't give up and with local police not bothering to take it as anything but a young lad leaving town Carl agrees to help. I LOVED this kid! One of the most memorable characters I have come across in a book in a very long time. I have lived in Ireland and Tara depicts a small Irish town perfectly. Her use of certain Irish slang and lingo is excellent but don't worry if Ireland is not familiar to you, she will draw you into the sometimes suffocating closeness of life here. Her characters are brilliantly done and I fell in love with many characters in this book. There are plenty to dislike also and as Carl digs deep into the secrets of this small town not everybody is as they seem. Many times Tara surprised me with reveals around characters that left me somewhat speechless. SO well done! A tale of torn loyalties, small-minded life, secrets and complex relationships that will keep you engaged from page one. I hungered for more of these characters and felt empty once the book was done. This is a literary thriller that stands as one of my best reads of 2020. Get this one onto your bookshelf for sure!"

Where the books from the series are fast-paced, thrilling and often brutal, French really takes her time with The Searcher. It's not until almost three quarters into the book that actually something happens and the plot really moves forward but never was I bored for a minute before that. French paints the village and its complicated dynamics, its unwritten laws and rules that nobody tells you but you're expected to follow anyway, the land that turns harsh and haunting as autumn sets and especially the characters so vividly and with such love for detail. I flew through the book, getting to know Trey and the other villagers, trying to look behind their masks and untangling the web of their relations at Cal's side and I loved every second of it.

Me encanta como está escrito.La trama avanza lento pero eso no supone algo malo. Era entretenido y demás, mi único problema era que ya estaba por la mitad y todavía no había signos de que algo se resolviera, después el ritmo aumentó bastante y todo encajó satisfactoriamente. El misterio en sí es bastante complejo y no contiene nada turbio, lo cual se agradece bastante. Creo que el objetivo principal de la historia era seguir a los personajes, reflexionar sobre ciertas cuestiones y descubrir todo poco a poco. Algo que también quiero destacar son los personajes.

This is the second book set in the western part of Ireland that I've read this week (the other being Rainsongs) and my description of both of them is that they are ""quiet"" books. This current Tana French book doesn't have the grit and noise of her Dublin Murder Squad books, and is probably much more like The Witch Elm in tone. But even that one often gave me a knot in the pit of my stomach. No knot with The Searcher. This is much more of a character study of individuals as well as individuals as members of a community: small town life; protecting each other; wary of strangers; etc. And in the end, I think the main character, Cal Hooper, made the right decisions."

I'd forgotten though that I requested a copy from the library before it was even released based on French's name alone so since I had it I figured I would go ahead and read it and I'm so glad that I did. I'm not sure what people were basing their dislike on but I didn't see it. As far as I'm concerned Tana French worked her magic yet again. Yes, the main character, Cal, was an American. But he is surrounded by all things Irish after he gives up a long successful law enforcement career and moves to a run down house in a small village in Ireland. He is spending his time refurbishing the house and attracts the attention of a local teen, Trey. Their characters were so well done I could see them clearly, as well as those with smaller roles.

Honestly, I wasn’t curious about what happened to Trey’s brother. I felt more interested in Cal’s past relationships, the reason why he divorced with Donna, and what was wrong with Alyssa.I really liked Cal, btw. He is a little bit rough but he is smart and know how to make people talked. His interaction with Mart is funny, and Mart is really kind to Cal. But after almost reading half of the book, Mart seemed a little bit suspicious. And that’s all. Until half of the book, still there wasn’t any progress about what happened to Brendan. Most of the resident seemed fishy, but why exactly? I know the author aimed to have a slow plot, but it’s too slow.Also the truth that came out, it wasn’t had any plot twist or something that i was looking for. And I thought that the ending would be Cal made up with either Donna or Alyssa, and i was wrong again. It’s just hanging, unfinished.

120,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34401683-bob-brinkmeyer,Rating 4 out of 5,"A lot of classic Westerns feature an isolate hero, characteristically male, who moves through the West’s wide-open spaces, surviving by his own skills and remaining committed to his personal sense of honor and justice. He’s rarely originally from the West and indeed is often from the South. The western land in which he moves is usually either entirely lawless or almost so, at best ruled by a barely operating legal system. The hero often takes the law into his own hands, resolving conflicts and setting things right that the system can’t or won’t. Tana French’s The Searcher, set in Ireland, is of course not a Western, but it certainly draws on the Western’s tropes. The hero, Cal, is a man from North Carolina who has quit his job as a detective in Chicago and has moved to the outskirts of a tiny town in a desolate part of western Ireland. He wants to set his life in order, living a simple life, adhering to his simple code of honor and justice. It’s not long, however, before he’s drawn into investigating the disappearance of a young man from the nearby town. He gets involved because of his loyalty to a youth he has met and because there’s no one else to investigate: the people of the town, including the police, don’t care at all about the missing man or his family. Or at least so it seems. Things get much more complicated as Cal digs deeper into the disappearance. Cal is obviously the searcher of the title, and French’s title is a clear reference to the classic Western The Searchers, a fine novel by Alan Le May and a spectacular movie (adapted from the novel) by John Ford that is generally regarded as one of film’s greatest Westerns. In The Searchers a seasoned veteran from the South pursues his niece who has been abducted by Indians; he’s accompanied by a young sidekick who begins as a youth and eventually grows into a man. Cal also has a young sidekick in The Searcher whom he mentors in the ways of survival and of life, and in some ways it’s their relationship—fraught and often rancorous—that is as much at the center of the novel as the mystery itself. Both grow from their relationship. Rather than riding off into the sunset having solved the mystery, Cal in the end has grown to understand that he can follow his code of justice while at the same time opening himself to others, even if that makes him more vulnerable. French builds her plot slowly and meticulously, not unlike a John le Carre novel, in which situations and characters are painstakingly developed before anything much happens in terms of the central drama. The tension thus builds ever so slowly, drawing the reader inexorably into the novel’s mystery. It’s quite an achievement. French, quite simply, is a masterful writer, and her descriptions of the stark and desolate landscape, like those of many writers of the American West, are gorgeous and at times breathtaking."

For what it's worth, I'm a newbie to her writing and I really enjoyed The Searcher. Sure, the most common remark from negative reviews is the pacing and the fact that it's slow to start. I found that to be the case as well, but I didn't mind it. It takes time to build a character from the ground up, especially if the setting is small. The story is set in a small town in Ireland. The kind of place where everyone knows everyone and one day our protagonist walks in and he's the talk of the town. Cal is an ex-police office from Chicago of all places and he's looking for peace and quiet after a painful divorce. The novel starts with a lot of talk about home renovations, because that's what Cal is focused on when the story kicks off. However, he doesn't have time to complete it before a local child, Trey, finds him and appeals to him for help. His brother has disappeared and he's hoping Cal can find him. Cal reluctantly agrees, because he feels a restless itch. The fact that something iffy seems to be going on in this small community is impossible for him to ignore. What I loved most about this novel is that Cal's situation felt really realistic. He's a retired policeman from another country, he doesn't have the means to do investigations the way he did them back in the States. How he deals with this is the strength of the story and the reason why I think the slow build up is OK. I found myself completely absorbed into the story and its setting in rural Ireland. I really wanted to find out what happened to Trey's brother. I give this book 4.5 stars and I can't wait to read more books by Tana French. Many thanks to the publisher Penguin UK and Netgalley for providing me with a review copy!"
122,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1394928-laura,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.75 stars. I enjoyed this book so much. If you're not expecting a breakneck thriller, and you enjoy her other work, you should enjoy this one too. The first half was slow for many readers, but I really enjoyed it, and would've been happy if that pace and mood would've continued throughout. There was an older person mentoring a younger person they'd not previously met, there was a character who basically bagged their life to start over again in a different country, there was furniture / home restoration, there was the beautiful Irish countryside, a bit of nature writing bordering on magical realism in spots, so, so many things that make me extra happy when I run into them inside the pages of a book. Add to that French's excellent characterization and her magnificent writing, and a wonderful audiobook performance, great characters I enjoyed spending time with, etc., I could go on and on. I'd have given it five stars if it'd been less like a thriller and kept up the mood of the beginning. But when you read Tana French, you have to expect that! This wasn't over the top violent by any stretch, but it loses a quarter star bc of the difference between the first and second halves in that respect. I do hope she will make this book the first of a series. It would be absolutely fantastic and our main character is a retired Chicago cop who solves a mystery of sorts here. Would love to see him do more of this. This town and these characters have a lot more to say. Please, Ms. French 🙏🏻😀💙Edited to add: Yay, she’s continuing this series! The Hunter"

I’m accustomed to the beauty of her settings, dialogue so genuine my brain speaks it aloud, and the emotional undercurrents running deep through every scene. Her latest is every bit as worthy.Like all her work, I finished The Searcher and considered what exactly I just read.It’s the story of a man letting go of his marriage, his career, and even his country. It’s about Ireland, of course. Always. It’s an illustration of small town life in all its peace, struggle, and lack of privacy. It’s about unlikely friendships, some of which flourish and some that die a most brutal death. It’s a tale of losing your moral compass and resetting it, for better or worse. It’s about being the outsider. It’s the mystery of what happened to a promising young man who suddenly disappeared from his community.It’s not about furniture restoration, no matter how annoyed some readers are with that desk. The desk is busy work, distraction, a shared purpose, a focal point while more important things happen.I don’t believe it’s about defunding the police, but the great thing about literature is we all see different things in its pages.As usual, it wasn’t French’s mystery that hooked me. It was everything else along the way.Five stars again."

A retired detective thinks he can escape the big city job by moving but is quickly pulled into a mystery bigger than the town that harbors it.
I wanted to love this book because the last one was a dud. This one was an improvement but is still not the grand slam I expect from such an outstanding author. It does suck for her that the bar is set so high, but that is life. If you show your shiny best a few times people will expect it permanently.I will say that her descriptions were on point. I felt lost in the landscape and could easily picture the layout of the backyard and all the night sounds a fall evening would present. The characters were also sitting right next to me throughout the whole story and I could have happily read more about each one of them. Where things fell apart was the predictability of the mystery and my irritation for the lead not seeing what was right in front of his face.Three stars for excellent visuals."

This, her second standalone, does what folks wanted to believe THE WYTCH ELM did -- I liked that book, but did not think it anywhere near her best -- in that it proves she can write anything and make it compelling. Much of this book is housework, small conversations, missed cues and solitudinal thought.Don't worry, there's also a missing kid and some strangely slaughtered sheep. And drugs. And small towns fading into obscurity.I fucking loved every word of this and would read it all again in a heartbeat. While it doesn't capture the top spot in my personal French rankings (THE LIKENESS still takes the cake for me; that book...), it is absolutely phenomenal and if you aren't reading Tana French, now is a good time to start. This one, this one will hook you good. "
126,no user info,Rating 1 out of 5,"This is a very short story that got padded and padded into a novel. As an example of the padding- the main character gets his ass kicked by three men. How does he react while lying there bleeding? He starts remembering other times dating back to childhood that he got his ass kicked. His survival instinct doesn’t kick in because that might hurry the plot along. Instead he lays there reflecting. A good 4/5th of this book consists of reflections and ponderings. The story could fit on one page. And the main character— a supposedly intelligent cop — buys a house sight unseen in a town he never met in a country he never visited, and lands himself in the middle of a drug conspiracy. Sure Tana. Make them bucks, even if it requires you to hustle out pointless story after pointless story, chock full of blather and padding. One star is too much for this drivel."

Nothing about this works for me--characters I can't find it in me to care about, terribly weak plot at this point, inexplicable American - Irish mashup, motivations that seem contrived or missing, writing that's fine but not as compelling as it would have to be to seduce me to keep going. Maybe it all comes together to pay off for the difficult start and becomes the book worthy of the glowing reviews. I’ve decided not to know and leave space for my anticipation to grow for her next book. "
128,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23024303-daniel-shindler,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book has a lot of depth Tana French’s stand alone novel is an exploration of the human condition wrapped in a mystery story. The plot is fairly straightforward, reprising classical narratives of a stranger coming to a small town and delving into a hidden secret. The stranger is Cal Hooper, a retired police officer who is divorced and burned out from his years on the job. He is an American who decides to take refuge in a small village in rural Ireland, having purchased a decrepit farm that he wants to restore. As he is acclimating to his new life, he meets a young taciturn teenager who wants him to find a missing brother. Reluctantly, Cal is drawn into unofficially probing for clues about the brother’s fate. He encounters silence and resistance from the village residents. Eventually, Cal plods his way through to unravel the solution. The allure of this book, for me, does not lie in the mystery itself. The mystery is credibly plotted and moves at a brisk enough pace. Rather the characterization and interplay between Cal and the teenager Trey give this novel a great deal of depth and emotional engagement. French’s prose and dialogue provide the book with an emotionally resonating tone. The reader is left with a sense of poignancy that will linger."

But later the book just started to fade away for me, it was so boring because nothing really happens in this book. And that's a fact. This was my first book by Tana French and I'm so disappointed.

He wasn't long finding trouble though, or rather trouble searched him out and made him seek answers.Well this book has reminded me of all the things I love about Tana French- Her characters sparkle with life. We get so many subtle clues about what makes them tick and it just makes me feel like I know them intimately.- The plot is buried deep within the pages. So deep that sometimes you forget it's brewing away nicely in the background while you are just caught up in the characters and the lush writing.- You need to read between the lines. Tana French will never spell everything out for you, and you have to form your own opinions of why things happened and what really motivated certain people to act certain ways.- Initially the ending disappointed me. But when I reflected it felt perfect as it was a full circle right back to where we started.- The theme is heavy, red raw and left me feeling very unsettled. Because I pictured everything vividly in my head while I read. Balanced to perfection with colourful banter between Cal and the locals.Complex, full of mockery and life in all shades; I just loved it."

I suppose nothing she has written since IN THE WOODS and THE LIKENESS will compare to those two, and there are a few that were even forgettable. I had high expectations of THE SEARCHER, as friends and critics alike have given it accolades, but my reading experience wasn’t as passionate or thoroughly absorbing. The dilatory pace (and too much exposition) didn’t lead to a brilliant reward, because the character that the protagonist was investigating/searching for never came alive for me. Moreover, I get the sense that French may have been setting this book up as a first of a series. The lead man, Cal Hooper, is a retired Chicago cop, divorced, who took a big risk and moved to a berg in Western Ireland. Any of his minor flaws are forgivable. He’s that consummately likable, full-of-integrity protagonist that typical series books depend on. A bit of the aw-shucks, but unafraid and focused on his target. I feel like this novel is a little bit of a sell-out—careful to be inoffensive, and relatable to hearts everywhere. And trite. Aw shucks."

Those that are looking for a seat-of-your-pants thriller or heavy, heart-thudding suspense won't find a lot of it here. However, if you love strong contemporary fiction and/or literary fiction, here it is. I was turned down for the galley, and so I checked out the audio version from Seattle Bibliocommons as soon as it became available. (Serious wait list; no surprise there.) I finished it this evening, and although I have other books on board, this is the one I keep thinking about. I'm particularly taken with the character named Trey, who is at least as important here as the protagonist. That said, once again, this is not from the Dublin Street series, which I also love; it's a stand alone novel, and an excellent one at that. I don't want to give spoilers, but I will say this: thank you, Ms. French, for not hurting the beagles. The narrator does a splendid job. Highly recommended."

In between he finds himself coming to terms with the noise and pollution of his mind and soul.His new home in Ireland is idyllic and so different from his life as a cop in Chicago. Where he hopes to find a different serenity, he discovers silence with a roar. A relaxing read. An almost philosophical, lackadaisical, surreal plot, but a new possibility for gen Z. The thirteen-year-old Trey was the main focus. The author captures the reader immediately with the soulful descriptions of the bogs, rains, animals, people. It is as though we moved in with Cal and went with him on his new discoveries. In fact, I decided I will stay even if Cal decides to go back to Chicago! There is so much to otherwise enjoy in this novel, although I would have preferred a more 'classic' fast-moving suspense thriller or even detective drama. Overall a good choice to read something different."

Here at least, the despair isn’t as fresh, unresolved. We actually make it through to the final stage of grief which is silver lining. Still have a cop or ex-cop, a dead body, a twisty maze of suspects and that oppressive sense of being unable to escape. Here there’s window even we never take it and that makes this book less devastating to me than the Dublin series. It’s horrible but the acceptance makes all the difference. "

French's usual skill with pacing and characters is on display here, and the Ireland setting is (as ever) evocative.

Though French doesn't follow the Dublin Murder Squad crew, she follows an ex-Chicago police officer, Cal Hooper. Cal leaves America for Ireland in order to get away from bad memories and the end of his marriage. I thought French did a great job with Cal's point of view and the development of secondary characters like Trey and Lena. I also loved the ending since it was typical French in my mind. What would you do in the situation that Cal finds himself in? Would you choose the same? You hold your breath through the last 1/3 of the book after everything is revealed just waiting for the shoe to drop. Could you keep living like that? I enjoyed this immensely and have my fingers crossed that French dropping hints about revisiting Rob from In the Woods in a future book comes true. I am still haunted by that book and Rob. I will not speak on The Likeness since that and ""The Witch Elm"" are my least favorite of French's books.""The Searcher"" follows ex-Chicago police officer, Cal Hooper. Cal is in his late 40s and has left America for an old house and some land in Ireland. We find out that Cal's marriage (which he was quite happy in) ended unexpectedly. He has an adult daughter that he finds hard to connect with. Yes, I had my eyebrows raised since the dude did just abandon the US (I get it though Cal) for another country. Cal is getting the lay of the land and is fixing up his home. His nearest neighbor, an older man named Mart comes by and gives him grief. Cal has a routine with the local shopkeeper and is starting to feel part of things. However, Cal starts to realize that someone is watching him and is concerned that the person wants to harm him. Cal eventually befriends the person watching him, Trey, a 12 year old local that comes to Cal because they want his help in finding their missing brother. Cal isn't a cop though and he really has no idea where to start, but he starts to dig, and finds that there's a darkness in his local community he had no idea of at all.I really found myself liking Cal a lot. He has made mistakes, but is trying to do what he thinks is best for Trey. When Cal starts to realize that the community he has made himself home in, is not all sunshine and friendly neighbors you start to realize that he has walked himself into something that can end up causing him and Trey harm. Cal also you can tell misses his wife and daughter, but doesn't know how to communicate with either of them without it turning into a disappointing talk each time. I think watching him with Trey it's in the back of Cal's mind that he can do something here. What I did love though with this story is the parallels between what Cal ended up doing when an incident occurs with his daughter. In the end, Cal chooses different, and I think in that way French is signaling that things will be different here. I liked the secondary characters like Mart, Lena, and Noreen in this one. There's a slowly dying farming community where Cal ends up and you can see the struggle for those who still live there to keep it going. But it's definitely going out on its last gasp if the young don't stay. This community reminded me a bit of my hometown (without the racism though) with the younger generation moving away and the homes/farms just falling into disrepair. We also get some glimpses of how the crash is still impacting Ireland and how many of the younger crowd are getting by. I loved the writing in this one. Not going to lie though, the book starts off slow. It takes a bit for it to get going (around the 15 percent mark for me) since it seems such a departure for French to take on an American as the main protagonist. But once you get into the rhythm of the book it's hard to put it down. The setting of this community at times seems pretty fantastic until Cal starts to uncover things that have gone on. Also, there's hints here and there about something darker in this part of the world, but Cal at times seems too blind to it. Or he wants to be blind to it.I loved the ending, but wonder if that's the end or not. Will we get another story in a few years time with an older Trey? "

I love Tana French anyway, have read all her Dublin MUrder Squad books and they're great. This book is totally different. It's not about the murder squad, it's about a retired policeman from America who comes to Ireland to retire and how busy and mixed up his life becomes after he tries to settle down. He is divorced and not on good terms with his ex wife and his daughter is grown and he does keep in contact with her but the lives of the people in the small town where he now lives all become a big part of his life, especially a teenage girl who he bonds with and becomes her friend, helps her a lot. I think this is first book in a new series and I will definitely read more."
146,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33603612-chrissie,Rating 3 out of 5,"Cal Hooper, a retired police officer hailing from Chicago, has settled into a ramshackle old place in a tiny town in rural Ireland. He's newly divorced and still struggles with thinking about all the things he'd tell his now ex-wife if they were still together. He's quiet and contemplative, clearly out as far as he's willing to go to get away from it all. As French slowly unfolds the novel's basic plot, together with Cal's story, we get a better sense of who Cal is and from what he might be trying to escape.I'm sad to say this ended up being a surprisingly middling book from French. By no means did this put me off her writing, but felt that this didn't quite land where she was aiming. The quality of her writing and her command of the written word is astounding and beautiful, but ultimately I was left with a sorry ambivalence in the end. French said in an interview that this was inspired by True Grit — and I can see the shadows of this throughout The Searcher. This book definitely has the feels and inspiration of the Western film genre — always associated with the United States and the American cowboy or rancher, but French's glorious writing hasn't shifted from its expected beauty to accommodate anything more typical of any style or genre. I mean, I don't think she can write a bad sentence.Just as ever, French's writing is a wonder to read — she takes her time and develops the characters, the atmosphere, and — certainly the slower of the bunch — the plot. Basically it all boils down to a missing person case. French's novels are never just one thing — and they are never plot-forward, so that's not surprising. But what she lends to the atmosphere and the characters, she loses a bit of in other ways. Cal is gruff and emotionally weathered — he feels very much the staunch, roughened American from the Old West. Except he's not — he carried a contemporary Chicago police badge until recently, not a U.S. Marshal star, à la Wyatt Earp. And he's not even that anymore, either. So, French's aim seems to be similar to how she worked good old Toby in The Witch Elm, and explore another side of detecting and police work. Where Toby played a challenging multi-faceted part (witness, suspect, perpetrator, and victim), Cal's character is relatively static. Here we have an ex-cop who has to now operate with his same methodologies to figure out what happened to a missing kid, but without the support system he's known his whole career. He has to do the detecting both solo and sans databases of information. Nothing really is at his disposal at all — other than his wits — because he's a stranger and an outsider in this tiny Irish town.For the majority of his introduction, French slowly introduces Cal's character to the reader. The problem here is just how very long and drawn out this introduction takes. I had the same problem with the beginning of The Witch Elm, and even had to put that book aside for a few months before starting again. But where Toby's attack starts off The Witch Elm and it's only the mystery that is the slow reveal, nothing much at all happens for the first 100 pages or so with Cal. During this time a few things stuck out like thorns. First, the present tense. The only way I can reconcile this, is to assume French desired a cinematic approach to match the idea of a Western film in her mind. She wanted the book to unfold in the same way watching a movie allows the story to unfold for your eyes. But I don't like present tense, and I didn't like it here. Film is a visual medium (there is literally no other way to tell the story) and books are decidedly not. Although, if anyone can make it a tolerable choice, French can. Her writing, along with the story itself, doesn't focus on any sort of propulsive action — so the idea of being held unnecessarily in a single moment that lasts too long is not an overwhelming, put-the-book-down problem. (But am I even me if I don't point out the present tense?) It wasn't intolerable, but it provided enough resistance throughout that I continually noticed it.Another big thorn was actually me trying to figure out why Cal was American. French does bring in some light dabbling into American politics and race relations (particularly with cops), without naming anything at all, so there's that. Though if I had read this when it was first released, I think the angle of him being a cop and his particular stalwart good guy image, would've just angered me, given all that was happening at that time actually in the U.S. And Cal does read like a hardened, surly American, though French leans into it too far and it's all just a bit too on the nose. But other than the main idea that he must exist in this new place as a detective without being official and while being a complete stranger to the people he must now question, Cal's nationality never makes sense to me. And I think this overt characterization is generalized too much for what I expect of French — Cal is never anything other than Cal. He doesn't change throughout the book — he's a dependable character, sure . . . but why is he without an arc? Cal is basically Snow White, a character unchanged by the story's end, no matter all that has happened. French's main characters usually undergo a tremendous change or revelation by the end of the book, and I honestly missed that here.A similar problem is how very un-American he could feel. While I was still reading this one in print (I made it just shy of page 200), I struggled to stay focused and was constantly distracted by the Britishisms and Irishisms from Cal and his narration (though he's third-person limited here). From the construction of his sentences, to tiny little references and words you wouldn't normally hear from an American, Cal never settled much and remained rather unknowable in this way, to my dismay. This made me very aware of the author mingled into the story, which is something I always find off-putting.With all that friction, I decided to try and switch to the audiobook for the remaining half. I'm glad I did — though that provided its own amusing problems. With the audio, I find the present tense far more able to drift into the background (and stop making itself known constantly). And though I was able to get to through the rest of the book far more easily, I still was left with the notion that it was already leaving me. French's books normally get into my bones and can be felt in my veins, but The Searcher, though fairly engrossing in the last quarter (eighth?), wasn't the visceral experience I've come to know with French.Audiobook, as narrated by Roger Clark: To my surprise, I found myself switching from reading this book in print to the audiobook and having Arthur Morgan reading to me instead. Being incredibly familiar with Clark's voice work from Red Dead Redemption II, I had a bit of a wobbly start to this and worried I wouldn't be able to handle this medium either. But once I was able to release Arthur Morgan from my mind's clutches, I allowed Clark to settle in as he should. He has a magnificent reading voice — and all the rough warmth and gravitas needed for Cal. His narration pulled the character out of the unknowable for me."

Since the town, the police and just about everyone around doesn’t seem to care or so it would appear. The story develops slowly building the scene in a methodically beautiful way that almost feels like a whole story in itself. French uses subtle clues to let the readers know just enough, almost letting them miss important details if they aren’t paying attention. The mystery unfolds as the reader gets to know Cal deeper and finds how his decision to help Trey might get him into deeper trouble than expected and that the small Irish town has more secrets than it appears. As the relationship between Cal and Trey develops the reader finds more reasons to love them both, wishing there was a way to make it all better. Thorn between what is the right thing to do and what would be best for Trey, Cal is faced with some particularly difficult decisions. Beautifully written and enjoyable with some shocking twists. Just be warned that if you are an impatient reader you might find yourself getting anxious to get to the end of the book. This book isn’t for the reader looking for a quick thrill, it takes time to read and fully appreciate its depth."
148,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23235496-kat,Rating 3 out of 5,"""The Searcher"" is a slow burn novel set in a rural Irish countryside and my first book by the author. We follow Cal, an ex Chicago policeman, who, in a search of a quiet and peaceful life, decided to move to a remote village in Ireland. But he is proven wrong when one day a strange teenager shows up in his garden. As I mentioned above it was my first book by Tana French and I instantly fell in love with the writing style. The author did a fantastic job describing the characters and painting a great portrait of a closed community and relationships between villagers. The characters are very well crafted in my opinion and three dimensional which is a great plus. Unfortunately where the book failed me is the plot and and a slow pace. I would not necessary called ""The Searcher"" a thriller, it is more of a character driven contemporary fiction with a mystery in its centre. And perhaps it's here where my disappointment started as I was expecting a murder mystery instead. Nothing much happens in the first 80% of the book and I was hopping the ending will rescue my review but unfortunately I was left disappointed. Overall it's a great solid read and if you are looking for a character driven novel I would recommend ""The Searcher"". I will be definitely checking author's previous work as the writing was fantastic."

I read my first book by Tana French a few Christmas’s back. I was sitting by a Christmas tree and had taken a pic for the heck of it. It’s why I decided to take a similar one this eve. The book I read was called,”In the Woods.” Well. It didn’t disappoint either. Tana French writes great books. This one, “The Searcher,” fairly deserves a 5 star. It had twists and turns that, kept me on the edge of my seat, some good Irish laughter, the beautiful mountains to reflect in, along with hunting, good and bad people, and a murder. I could have done without the explanation of how to gut a rabbit though! I even got taken by surprise by someone’s change of identity. In the end, it was a nice reflection of how there are good natured people in the world amongst the murderers and useless thugs. The ending surreal and the pictures of nature ,the author describes, beautifully. I’ll read more. She’s up there on my list of best authors."
150,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17465866-anni,Rating 5 out of 5,"As a lover of Irish fiction, I was immediately drawn to this novel because of the setting in rural Ireland and I wasn’t disappointed. It’s a leisurely-paced narrative in the traditional Irish style, with brilliant character studies and pitch-perfect dialogue.The plot involves a newcomer to an area - an ex-cop from Chicago relocating to a remote Irish village - who gets drawn in to a missing persons case, whilst having to adapt to a different way of life and social rules. In this respect the novel follows the archetypal Western genre of the stranger in town who is called upon to sort out trouble - the film “Shane” comes to mind. There are many evocative descriptions of place and local customs. and the story was so engrossing that I began to feel as if I were part of the local community - making me reluctant to finish reading and leave it all behind!With thanks to the publisher for the ARC via Netgalley "

As far as the plot line went, I found it wobbly and not really original, as far as some of the unique plots out there. The writing was decent enough once accepting of the long chapters and dawdling conversations. Some fight scenes were thrown in but were a little erratic feeling misplaced. Aside all that (sorry, I know the author has many devoted fans) as a whole it was good enough and similar to her other novels. Except for The Likeness which is the best in my opinion.I didn't agree with the vigilantism in the novel, to the degree. No amount of biscuits would suffice a rollover of thought. It's probably more a 3.5, but I'll leave it. I have reoccurring thoughts about what I read. Read last year, second blurb added a year later."

156,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68152408,Rating 4 out of 5,"К новой книге Таны Френч я подходил со скепсисом и заниженными ожиданиями, потому что «Ведьмин вяз» мне скорее не понравился. И с такой позицией «Искатель» оказался отличным романом, от которого я не отлипал два дня — он тихий, спокойный, максимально неспешный, но не убаюкивающий. Там, где я клевал носом на «Вязе», в «Искателе» рассматривал с широко раскрытыми глазами. А все потому что красивые декорации, хорошие персонажи и тайна, которая совсем не тайна, потому что ты ее разгадал самостоятельно.«Искатель» — это как если бы «Одни из нас» лишились зомби и городских руин, переехали в антураж дождливой зеленой Ирландии. Что интересно, туманные пасторальные задники можно заменить на песчаные пустоши Дикого Запада и история сработает одинаково. Это вестерн со всеми классическими приемами: есть ковбой-одиночка (новый шериф в городе, ага), несчастный диковатый подросток, своевольная женщина в седле и старичье с хитрым прищуром, которые могут испортить тебе жизнь всего одним шепотком в местном салуне, и пропавший человек, на которого кому-то не пофиг. Играли в Red Dead Redemption? Теперь, считайте, что поиграли. В «Искателе» примерно столько же круто поставленной драматургии и такие же проработанные персонажи.Понравилось, что условное «расследование» или, если подыграть названию, поиски — самая слабая часть книги. И только потому, что это соответствует реальной жизни. Только болтовня, никакой прослушки, распечатки звонков и прочего экшена. Сам Кел говорит, что будь у него гаджеты, вот тогда бы он прям ух сколько всего сделал. Простой деревенский мужик без значка и спецтехники очень ненадежное средство для установления истины — меня это покорило до глубины души. Оказывается, свидетели могут просто послать куда подальше и ничего не говорить. Вот же ж!Мы знаем, что Тана Френч гений диалогов. Теперь мы узнали, что она еще обладает огромным талантом подавать флэшбеки так, что это не бесит. И вот ты читаешь-читаешь книгу, в ней вроде ничего не происходит, все такое неспешное и замершее. Но если окинуть все прочитанное взглядом, то ты понимаешь — нам дали очень много информации.Ты знаешь про отношения Кела с дочерью, про нападение, про второй шанс, про «кодекс», про развод с женой и поэтому создается впечатление, что роман начался не с починки злосчастного бюро, а намного раньше и событий было гораздо больше. Воспоминаний Кела немного, но они очень тактично и выверенной затягивают вглубь, их не хочется прерывать, потому что в настоящем времени вот-вот должно случиться что-то интересное.Кроме того, Тана один из немногих авторов, кто может описывать природу так, чтобы это не было уныло и одинаково. Добавьте ненавязчивый юмор и удивительную способность из налипшей грязи, палок и щенят сплетать уютный кокон, в котором, пусть ненадолго, персонажам и читателям становится хорошо и комфортно.Отдельного упоминания заслуживает шикарный перевод диалогов и всей природоведческой части — каждый листочек живой, каждый персонаж выпуклый и настоящий. Поэтому вдвойне обидно, когда появляются миазмы редактуры имени Макса Немцова. Я заранее приготовился, что названия групп переведут на русский, поэтому лишь посмеялся, когда One Direction стали «Одним направлением». Что даже пришлось делать сноску, ведь кто-то мог не понять. Есть отличный лайфхак — оставить название группы без перевода, тогда и сноску делать не надо. Но к одному я был не готов: «миньоны» стали «приспешниками», «одинокий рейнджер» превратился в «одинокого объездчика», а «рубашка Кела» стала «Келовой рубашкой» и прочие келовые массы, вы знаете. Я думаю, что Шаши сделала свою работу отлично, ей даже пришлось писать эти сноски, чтобы объяснить гонево завравшегося светила.В чате мне сказали, что это фишка Немцова, у него есть свой план, которого он придерживается сотни лет. Все холивары давно отгремели, нет смысла гнать волну. Но, как выяснилось, я и еще 9 человек, отреагировавших на сторис, считают переводческие решения Макса затейливой нелепицей. Так что, дорогие мои девять человек, я горю за вас.Я же наивно полагал, что самое важное при переводе книги — сохранить стиль автора и сделать так, чтобы людям было понятно. Стиль, наверное, сохранили. И, как мне кажется, людям понятны «Миньоны», поскольку эта франшиза именно под таким именем распространяется в России. Так написано в прокатном удостоверении Минкульта. А значит, у слова есть официальное употребление в России. Также в России прокатывали «Одинокого рейнджера», и примерно понятно кто это такой, не надо лезть в словарь и искать «объезчика». Но Максу Немцову и Шаши Мартыновой никто не указ. И бохсними, если бы это было в рамках восстановления справедливости — вы сто лет неправильно переводили Catcher in the Rye, вот как надо правильно. Так ведь миньоны и рейнджеры спокойно уложились в обиход, а нарочно отличающийся перевод этих слов выглядит лишь стремлением быть не как все.Издательство Фантом Пресс сообщило, что у переводчика есть право на свой стиль. Ок, но пусть не тычет своим стилем мне в лицо, а оставляет в пределах блога, где Макс с методичностью обиженной девочки называет идиотами всех, кто написал плохую рецензию на переведенную им книгу. Или в целом написал мнение, отличное от официальной позиции партии.Так что читать нового Ричарда Руссо в переводе Немцова я не буду. Там уже sorority (студенческие братства, общаги, вот это все) стало «женским землячеством». Землячество, my ass."
157,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3250759-paul-fulcher,Rating 2 out of 5,"Cal knew from the start it was hopeless. There's too much space up here for one man and a kid ever to cover. What he needs is a CSI team swarming all over the house, and a K-9 unit combing the mountainside. He feels like the world's big. gest fool, out here in a foreign country playing cop with no badge and no gun, and a thirteen-year-old kid and Officer Dennis for backup.Tana French’s The Searcher was one of my annual December routines, a left-behind-in-a-hotel-Christmas-week-beach-read. It is an interesting novel as while it starts with a variation on a Western trope, the stranger rides into town (here a retired US cop, moving to a small Irish community) it does its best to move off the obvious genre thriller runners. And it does so by a very slow burning plot, that doesn’t really burst into life until near the end, and instead has whole scenes of such excitement as the cop and the 13yo he befriends sanding runners for a chest of drawers. And while there is a sort of missing person mystery in the book, it’s resolution, the what/how and who, was rather anticlimactic given there really is only one likely scenario which indeed plays out. The novel’s strength is instead in its portrayal of the local villagers and the locale in which they live, as well as the uneasy but deepening relationship between the cop and his teenage sidekick.One passage particularly caught my eye…The river is sluggish today, moving in muscular, viscous-looking twists. Leaves fall onto its surface, drift for a second and are pulled under without a swirl or a trace. Cal thinks about telling the kid that Brendan fetched up in there, some accidental way. He could come up with a convincing story, maybe involving Brendan scouting locations for a business running fishing trips for tourists on heritage pilgrimages, or nature retreats for suits in search of their inner wild men, either of which is the kind of thing that the dumbass kid should have fucking gone for to begin with. He might pull it off. Trey trusts him, as much as he trusts anyone. And although the kid would fight the suggestion that Brendan is dead, he'd welcome the thought that Brendan didn't deliberately go off and leave him without a word. He would also welcome the opportunity to think of Brendan as a fine upstanding entrepreneur in the making. He might even welcome it enough not to wonder why Brendan would have taken his savings with him to check out suitable locations for actuaries to build tree forts, or why the actuaries would need lab masks.Not quite sure why my profession was dragged into this, and the author has misjudged if she thinks actuaries have an inner wild man to go in search of!2.5 stars rounded to 2 as the novel really could have done with more pacing in the earlier sections (and fewer than 400 pages)."
158,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7630898-bonnie-brody,Rating 5 out of 5,"Tana French is back in great form. The Searcher combines rich material that addresses moral and ethical dilemmas, mystery, the awesomeness of nature, and the dynamics of Ardnakelty, a small western Irish town. All of these themes meld together to create a fabulous book.Cal Hooper, a retired Chicago detective has chosen to move to Ardnakelty, purchasing an old and decrepit house, sight unseen. It needs a lot of work just to be livable. He is trying to get the lay of the land in his town and does not want to step on any toes. He understands that small towns have lots of interconnected dynamics and the last thing he wants is to get involved in any of them. As he tries to settle into his house he becomes aware that someone appears to be watching him and he feels the hairs on his neck go up. Who is it and why are they there? After catching the culprit, a 12 year old named Trey, he he finds out that Trey knows he's a detective and wants Cal to help him find his brother Brendan who disappeared a few months ago leaving no note or trace of where he was going. The last thing Cal wants is to involve himself in missing persons, the work he was doing in Chicago, but Trey is a unique kind of kid and manages to convince Cal to help. Trey comes from a poor and mostly derelict family. Cal has Trey helping him with fixing up the house and working on chores such as remodeling a desk. Trey wants the truth, the facts about what happened to Brendan. Cal promises him that but he's not sure how to proceed without stirring up the pot. As the pot gets stirred up a bit, Cal is seriously warned off the case.The beauty of this book lies in its language, narrative and characterizations. I feel like each time a character presented themselves, I could be in their skin. I felt the lushness of the Irish countryside, the importance of small town chatter, and the beauty of watching the rooks as Cal tries to befriend them outside his home. Cal grapples with his North Star, his morality and the necessity of it belonging to him alone. He follows no one else's path. As he tries to explain to Trey, ethics is doing the right thing but morality is something beyond that, the guiding factor in being a righteous person.This book is not one genre. It is a standalone novel that deals with human beings with all their frailties and strengths, the truths and lies that get us in trouble or keep us out of it. It is a novel of finding a home and feeling like it is possible to belong without having to run away. Cal's character is rich and wise, appreciative of the land and creatures that surround him. Trey is a survivor, a resilient kid who has managed to thrive despite facing some of the most dire life experiences.I treasured this book, every page, and highly recommend it to all of Tana French's fans and to those who want to read an amazing novel."
159,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/867628-catherine,Rating 4 out of 5,"Cal Hooper, recently retired Chicago PD detective, coming off a divorce and crisis of conscience, is renovating the dilapidated cottage he purchased in a small Irish village. At the beginning of the novel, this sounded like a brilliant idea. ""He paid thirty grand for 500 square feet and a lot of land,"" I told my husband. By the end, I wasn't so sure of this potential retirement plan. Irish villages can be dangerous.If a kid shows up at your door, asking for help finding a missing older brother, politely decline.If your neighbors' sheep are mysteriously mutilated, remain incurious.If the old-timer next-door invites you down to the pub for local moonshine, make an excuse.Tana French's slow, atmospheric take on a western hit the spot for me. Cal is (metaphorically) the new sheriff in town, except that he doesn't actually have any authority or occupational tools. He's a lone cowboy on a new frontier where he doesn't always understand the culture. He has his own moral code that didn't always jive with those of other cops or his ex-wife or their daughter's boyfriend. While Cal agrees that you should call people whatever they prefer to be called, he considers this to be a question of basic manners, not of morals. This outraged Ben enough that he stormed out of Cal and Donna's house in the middle of Thanksgiving dessert, with Alyssa in tears running after him, and it took him an hour to cool down enough to come back.In Cal's view, morals involve something more than terminology. Ben damn near lost his mind over the importance of using the proper terms for people in wheelchairs, and he clearly felt pretty proud of himself for doing that, but he didn't mention ever doing anything useful for one single person in one single wheelchair, and Cal would bet a year's pension that the little twerp would have brought it up if he had. And on top of that, the right terms change every few years, so that someone who thinks like Ben has to be always listening for other people to tell him what's moral and immoral now. It seems to Cal that this isn't how a man, or a woman either, goes about having a sense of right and wrong.Which is why Cal can't turn away the kid, or ignore the sheep, or say no to a local rite-of-passage, even if it all brings a world of trouble down on him."

You get a great sense of small village life and all the idiosyncratic personalities. Can we also say dysfunctional?The descriptions are wonderful and the characters well depicted. Sometimes you just can’t get away from your work...and your past. It’s a slow build that unpeels carefully like an onion. Often felt like it was a one man play or monologue. So worth reading.

164,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10281457-laura,Rating 4 out of 5,"Book reviews on www.snazzybooks.comThe Searcher is an intense, slow burner of a novel which does have elements of mystery and crime in, but this wasn’t the main crux of the novel. The story centers on Cal’s life in rural Ireland having moved from America; the way he becomes entangled with teenager Trey, who he helps to look for his missing older brother, is a vehicle for their friendship but the mystery side of the story wasn’t what drew me in, which is unusual for me! I was far more captivated by Cal and Trey’s bond.The story took a good 30% to draw me in as it starts off quite slow. I definitely found I was gripped much quicker when reading her other novels – particularly the Dublin Murder Squad series that I’m such a big fan of. This novel is significantly different from those so can’t really be compared fairly – the atmosphere and setting of the story really took me to that remote Irish village and I enjoyed reading about the interesting characters – Cal, Lena, Mart, Noreen, Trey, and others. I felt like I was right there with them, among the wild landscape and gritty everyday lives, where things are much more rough and ready than city life.Various important topics are addressed in The Searcher. We hear Cal’s memories and thoughts of his previous life in Chicago working as a cop, and the police brutality which eventually caused him to step away from the job, as well as issues such as homophobia and classism. Trey is from a poor family and often speaks of how his family are judged by others because of this; the locals comment so often on families that are seen as trouble or rough, and this illustrates how embedded these judgements are.I also liked that, where there could have been romance, French kept the story realistic and understated; the female character in question is a really strong woman who I immediately liked and she certainly isn’t falling into Cal’s arms – in fact we don’t see any real romance take place, despite other people in the village adding the pressure. Still we hear other characters say ridiculous things to Cal warning him about speaking to multiple women in case they start fighting over him, etc, which further shows the gossipy nature of the village. It also highlights how people are so fixated on relationships and women wanting to find partners.I really enjoyed The Searcher novel and would recommend it to anyone looking for an atmospheric, multi-layered read.* Many thanks to Viking Books for providing a copy of this novel on which I chose to write an honest and unbiased review, and inviting me onto the blog tour. *"
165,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2697302-maine-colonial,Rating 4 out of 5,"Did you ever see the movie The Quiet Man, with John Wayne and Maureen O’Hara? John Wayne plays an American, Sean Thornton, who moves to Ireland, where he was born, buys a cottage and land, and is determined to restore the cottage and make a go of farming and living a quiet life. Villagers are friendly, and the local matchmaker/bookie, Michaeleen, tries to give Thornton the benefit of his local knowledge. Thornton inadvertently crosses a local big man, and trouble ensues. Nothing too terrible; this is mostly a romantic comedy, after all.The setup of The Searcher reminded me of The Quiet Man. Like Thornton, Cal Hooper has retired early and moves to Ireland. He buys a derelict cottage with some land and he plans to fix up the place and live a quiet life. His neighbor, Mart, serves as his guide to local life, just as Michaeleen does for Thornton. But this is no romantic comedy. Cal’s not sure exactly who he’s crossed when he reluctantly agrees to find out what happened to young Trey’s brother Brendan. But the results threaten to be deadly, and the beautiful Irish country town is revealed to suffer several ills of the modern age.This is a slow burn of a novel, not a thriller. It’s crime fiction with an elegiac, literary tone."

We follow her lead as she shows us the structure and its minute intricacies carefully laid out. On the way she takes the time to introduce us to each of the crew. We listen to there tales engulfed in their visage. On the deck she herself is enthralled. We draw closer following the wave of her hand, the clarity of her voice modulated through the bullhorn. She remarks on the crested sea, the tidal movement of the waves, the manner the light shines and reflects off of it. Then as if it didn’t exist before she waves our eyes to the varied port and landscape on shore, its moments of beauty and shadowed silences. She is articulate. Our eyes seek what she unveils through the arc of the wave of her hand; undulating hills, deep wed forrest, a stretch of plains, the suddenness of a mountain’s rise. We gasp.Pointing to a shaded dell, its small patchwork of roadways, village stores and homes, she tells a tale of a man, an ex-policeman who moved there to get away from the haggard toils of his life, the seared pain of a lost marriage, and his need to fix everything amiss. She bellows over the crew each reintroducing themselves, how you bring your problems wherever you go. While he tried to fit in, she went on, as we again passed through the rooms of machinery, the village’s systems coiled upon systems in the ages wrought upon stone refusing to dissemble. Neither did he, Cal, at least his requirement to find or create something to fix more than the old run down cottage he bought. She takes us up the stairs leading to the deck and again the beautiful landscape, the wash of rain and mist, the folding blues of the sky. Trapped, she goes on, in his circularity of fixing one thing that creates another. We shake hands with the crew then climb the stairs. The sun shines high in the sky its rays skipping off the waves, the forest’s shadows splayed across the coastal rocks. the little village blinking with its lit windows and rolling hills. The next pass around we all comment on the gangplank drawn. No way to exit unless we can swim a distance. We continue on these circular visitations in their minutely varied repetitions. There is something here we do not know about? Something we have missed? Something of meaning? But continuing to follow her we complete our circle again and again as Cal the ex cop revolves around his.French’s descriptions in microscopic acuity is beautiful at first but as it continues in minutely differing forms it begins to pester like an annoying gnat. Going further it clots attempts to allow the story to unfold. I appreciate in depth descriptive writing when it sets a tone, begins to scout out underlying meanings. But this doesn’t happen here. It dragged on for a good 100 pages then off and on for the remainder of the text. Why do this repetition to the reader; put the reader through this. Sure you can jump ship but it is difficult for many if a lot of investment has already been put in. Some readers have described this style as a slow burn. For me after about 20 pages it stopped burning at all.Then there was the steadfast ex cop Cal. I just couldn’t identify with him. There was too little inner change, conflict. He was the kind of guy who loved building things, fixing them, refurbishing. I’m just not that kind of guy. The closest I come to it is in the morning I open the door and let the dog out. Even that fell through when last week my wife told me we didn’t have a dog.This didn’t help get any closer to Cal or to find an entry into the small wisps of a story or the writing style and structure. I did admire French’s bringing Cal and a little girl together revolving around carpentry. There were some touching moments. And although Cal is no longer a cop there is a crime to be solved which provides real suspense.As a French fan my fear is that she has left her crime series writing, The Dublin Murder Mysteries, to become a stand-alone novelist. This does not seem to me to be her strength. My fear is that she will continue pounding this wall with no apparent gains, or hopefully she progresses and becomes a fine novelist.  "

It was a great book to finish the year on. I've had The Searcher on my TBR list for a while. I loved the Dublin Murder Squad books as a whole and needed more Tana French to read when I finished them. I didn't jump right into it, knowing that the familiar characters wouldn't be a part of the story. I needed to allow space between the series and this one. I'm glad I did that, otherwise I probably would have been disappointed. Not that it was a bad book. It was just different.Cal is retired from the Chicago police force looking for a change (escape?) while fixing up an old run down house in rural Ireland. He leaves behind a failed marriage, a strained relationship with his adult daughter, and the stress from his job and big city life. Adjusting to small town life in an entirely new country has some serious learning curves for Cal. Along the way he manages to learn a few things about himself. Character development at its finest here.Speaking of characters, I believe they were all well written. It took a while for Cal to grow on me, but I believe that was intentional. He isn't the most open of people at first. The neighbors are all very colorful and enjoyable. And then there's The Kid. Once I met Trey, I was instantly sucked into the story. The relationship that grows between Cal and Trey is beautiful. And that's where my heart melted for Cal. His true character came shining through.This book touches on some deep themes such as family, commitment, and personal moral codes. It's really much deeper than it first appears.And so I'm left trying to decide how to rate The Searcher. It lies somewhere between three and four stars for me. The slow beginning and the length of time it took to get to the heart of the story drags it down. If I was the type to DNF early on, I don't think I ever would have finished this one. But then the last half of the book saved it. I'm going to be thinking about Cal and Trey for quite some time, so I believe The Searcher has earned four heart string tugging stars from me."
170,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6942006-suzy,Rating 3 out of 5,"I have such mixed feelings about Tana French's writing, often calling it bloated. And she did not disappoint in that regard in The Searcher. Here we get the story of Cal Hooper, a retired Chicago cop who decided to move to a small village in Ireland even though he does not have Irish heritage. The enjoyable part for me of seeing the story unfold is French's vivid descriptions of landscape, her insight into relationships and the Cal's interior conversation as he tries to let go of being a Chicago cop and to understand and integrate into the village. The frustrating part for me was seeing the story unfold SO SLOWLY!! So many scenes could have been just as rewarding if shortened. I often lost attention and patience, as the story lost momentum from scenes that went on way too long. But the ending! Brilliant! Stirring and poignant, but sad all that brilliance didn't permeate the rest of the story for me. I'm so glad I read this with a group. I would have rated it even lower if not, as the group helped me calibrate my expectations. French wrote a series of six murder mysteries where the murder was front and center. While there is a potential crime in The Searcher, this is more of a story of one man's experience dealing with letting go of being a cop, questioning his move and adapting to a new culture. Once I saw that, I could settle in and enjoy the book for what it is, not what I expected. Glad I read it, but for me not one of French's best efforts. Why I'm reading this: This is the book pick for February for the Mystery, Crime and Thriller group. I nominated it, so I will moderate the discussion - I'm glad it was selected! I've had this on my tbr for waaaaay too long."
171,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"I would like to thank Netgalley and Penguin General UK for an advance copy of The Searcher, a stand-alone novel set in the west of Ireland.After 25 years as a Chicago cop and a difficult divorce Cal Hooper moves to a small village in the West of Ireland for an escape and a quieter way of life. He spends his days fixing up his wreck of a cottage, fishing and drinking in the local pub until a local kid comes looking for help in finding his missing brother, Brendan Reddy. Cal doesn’t see how he can help and doesn’t want to but gradually finds himself looking into it.I enjoyed The Searcher which is a beautifully evocative depiction of rural Ireland where nobody’s business is really secret and everyone has an opinion. It could be said that the novel reflects the ambience as it is slow to start and develop, for example the ask for help doesn’t come until about a quarter of the way in. By then, however, the reader is well settled in to Cal’s life and ready for anything, including an unexpected solution.The novel has a crime but I don’t feel that is the focus of the novel as it’s solving takes a meandering and circuitous route. It’s more a story of an outsider trying to settle into a literally foreign environment and of a lonely man trying to do the right thing. I’m a crime buff and am’t much for character analysis but I found this fascinating. I liked Cal and his dilemmas and, having no knowledge of Irish rural life, I couldn’t work out if neighbour Mart’s homespun philosophy was real or a caricature. It didn’t stop me wondering. I found The Searcher slow in parts but on the whole I can recommend it as a good read."

In this case I’ll stick with four, though.THE SEARCHER is a bit of a departure for French. That is, the main character of this book isn’t Irish. Cal is American, a retired cop who has come to live in a small town in Ireland. He thought it would be a quiet place to live.A 13-year-old, who Cal mistakes for a boy, has asked, practically demanded, that he look into the disappearance of her brother. This is what Cal thought he was leaving behind when he moved to Ireland. Even so, he does get involved in this case, just like old times.Cal learns that small towns in Ireland can have the same trouble as big cities in the United States. There is no escaping it.I don’t give this book five stars because I didn’t like the way Cal talked. Although French writes wonderful dialogue between Irish people, she doesn’t quite get it right with Cal. I understand that she wanted to make clear that he isn’t a big-city guy. But sometimes he talks stupid. There is a difference between sounding country and sounding stupid. He clearly is not stupid. So he does not sound authentic as the Irish people do.I also was unhappy with the end. How could he stay? Although Cal does consider moving back to the United States, he also decides to get a new puppy. Wouldn’t it be cruel to make a dog fly all the way to the United States?"

It's a cleaner more straightforward plot but the tension is still there. It might be her most realistic/believable book. Charming and terrifying. I loved every page.

When you start off a book with birds killing an animal, where do you go from there? Tana's early books were slow to start, but they didn't take as long as her more recent novels to get to the point.

181,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2330809-steve,Rating 4 out of 5,"Having missed The Witch Elm (for whatever reason), this is my first Tana French effort outside of the Dublin Murder Squad, and I thought it was (deeply disturbing but) very well done and quite gratifying. True to form, I don't have much hesitation buying a Tana French novel, but I rarely start reading them immediately. They tend to sit (almost germinate) on my shelf, calling, nah, gently tugging at me. But, but, I need to be in a good/OK place, because she's not exactly a purveyor of happiness, cheer, joy, and delight, nor are the books fluffy little novellas you can bang our in a single sitting (at least not at my, relatively fast, but decidedly mere mortal, reading speed); but that doesn't mean they're easy to put down (which, of course, means that, once I start, there are other things that ... well ... won't get done until the book is finished).As I've found with her prior books, French is an elegant craftsman, at multiple levels, and my hat's off to her for developing and animating not only the protagonist, but also enough of the characters to keep me peering (and looking over my shoulder) in every conceivable direction.I can't say I was happy or satisfied with the ending, but that it in no way suggests it was anything other than entirely appropriate and true to form.I guess this means I need to put The Witch Elm on my to-read list. So many books, so little time... LoL"
182,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/931455-dorothy,Rating 5 out of 5,"Critics and readers in general often assign Tana French to the niche of crime fiction writers, but that really undervalues her art. Her novels could be more accurately described as thoughtful literary fiction in which a crime takes place. That has never been more true than in her latest novel, The Searcher. Several critics have noted the debt this particular novel owes to the classic Western movies, particularly collaborations between John Ford and John Wayne. The very title of the book is a nod to the Ford/Wayne movie ""The Searchers."" But there may be just a touch of ""The Quiet Man"" here, too, in the American who moved to western Ireland and became a part of the local scene in a small village. The American here is Cal Hooper, a Chicago cop for twenty-five years. Cal has just endured a rancorous divorce and his adult daughter has moved to Seattle. There seems to be nothing keeping him in Chicago except the job. A job from which he is eligible to retire. And that's exactly what he does. He invests in a fixer-upper cottage in a bucolic Irish village and moves there to set about repairing and upgrading it. It seems the perfect escape for the quiet life that he envisions. He gets acquainted with his neighbors, makes himself known at the local pub, and generally goes about settling into his new life.Then his cop sense begins to twitch. He begins to suspect that someone is watching him, even to the point of looking in his windows at night. He sets a trap by spreading smooth soil under his windows to capture footprints of the suspected interloper. And sure enough, in the morning, there they are - proof that someone was spying on him.He stays alert over the next several days and finally, his stalker shows up. It's a kid - a thirteen-year-old named Trey. Trey comes from a hardscrabble family living on the mountain adjacent to Cal's place. There are six kids in the family and a mother trying to keep them all fed and together. The father is nowhere to be found. Some months earlier, the oldest child, a boy named Brendan, had disappeared. No one has heard from him since and there seems no clue as to where he has gone or if he is still alive. Trey thinks he was kidnapped and wants Cal to find out what happened.Cal doesn't want to get involved, but once again that cop sense kicks in and he feels a need to solve this mystery. Also, he's becoming attached to Trey who helps him with chores around his place. His conversations with the child inevitably lead him to start asking questions. And that's when he begins to suspect that there are hidden layers to life in this quiet village and that there are dangerous secrets that he would be wise not to disturb. Cal's neighbor, Mart, who had taken the American under his wing and eased his entry to the village delivers an oblique warning that Cal is about to poke a hornet's nest. The warning doesn't take. As Cal goes about asking his inconvenient questions, the reader has a growing sense of dread that this is not going to end well for him or for Trey. French builds her plot ever so slowly and carefully with full attention paid to the beauty of the Irish landscape and to the insularity of village life. She makes us feel Cal's loneliness as he longs for his daughter, feeling that perhaps something is wrong in her life but unable to discover what it might be or do anything about it. He even misses being able to discuss things with his ex, Donna. And he begins to suspect that his neighbors are not to be fully trusted.Some critics have complained that this book is very different from French's Dublin Murder Squad series or her most recent book, The Witch Elm, and they seem disappointed with it for that reason. To which I reply, yes, it is different and why on Earth would you require a talented writer to write variations on the same story every time out? This is a story in which right and wrong are not simple and they are definitely not black and white. These characters' lives are filled with gray areas and morality is a complex issue. It is a narrative that gives the reader much to consider, the kind of thing that one would expect of the best literary fiction.I liked Cal Hooper quite a lot. Maybe I even fell in love with him a little bit. And Trey is a marvelous and ambiguous character. I did not want my time with them to end. This rates right up there with my favorite French novels. Her artistry and creativity are in full flower."
183,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5990485-mary,Rating 4 out of 5,"The Searcher is a book that I was a little hesitant to read after reading Tana French's last standalone The Witch Elm. I liked the story in The Witch Elm well enough but it was such a slowly-paced novel and I really couldn't handle another book like that. Thankfully, while The Searcher is still a slow burn, the pacing was much better for me and the book kept me fully engaged even though it is still a little hefty at almost 500 pages. I do love the way French writes a story though, and just like her other novel, this was an atmospheric and emotional story. There is nothing like a remote setting and through articulate and expressive writing, I was able to picture myself in this village in Ireland. I am definitely no stranger to what it feels like to live somewhere that everyone knows everyone, and when you throw in shady characters and a mystery you have the concoction for quite a story. The audiobook is just over 14.5 hours, but it didn't actually feel like it, and that is partially thanks to Roger Clark's brilliant narration. I couldn't have asked for anyone better to be the voice of Cal, and he fit into the character and the setting quite nicely. I thought there was a decent amount of tension and suspense in The Searcher, but what really made the book for me was the unlikely relationship between Cal and Trey. As grumpy as Cal tries to be, the introduction of Trey and the friendship they build as the book goes on was very heartwarming. This is a very character-driven novel, but the mystery was an excellent one as well, and French's writing is both meticulous and descriptive in a way you feel like you are right there without it being too much. The Searcher was such a nice surprise for me after my last experience with her writing, and it definitely has me excited to read more from her in the future."

Aquí, sin embargo, la trama sí está bien hilada y no me he sentido estafada por ningún tipo de artificio para hacerla más emocionante. Precisamente en relación a la trama, esta novela me ha recordado mucho a “Winter’s Bone” de Daniel Woodrell pero, por otro lado, no sólo el estilo de estos dos escritores es completamente diferente, sino que el contexto para dicha trama es a la vez tan distinto en la superficie y tan parecido en el fondo, que el contraste entre ambas obras proporciona un interesante ejercicio de comparación lectora.Aquí estamos en Irlanda, con sus brumas matinales, sus mil formas de lluvia, su repentino sol sonriendo sobre un paisaje luminoso y sus pantanos de turba. Ése es el entorno natural, pero el entorno humano es también muy diferente, la miseria tiene otro matiz, el lenguaje y las actitudes son menos cortantes, pero no menos peligrosos, por estar revestidos de un tipo de broma y jovialidad que da un aire liviano a las interacciones.Los personajes están bien trazados y resultan creíbles. Quizá mi principal crítica en este sentido tiene que ver con la, más bien banal e innecesaria, explicación de los motivos del divorcio del Cal, el ex – policía; eso es algo demasiado superficial al punto de resultar inverosímil. Entiendo por qué esa referencia está ahí, para justificar algunas de las actitudes de Cal respecto a Trey pero no me parece necesario.En resumen, una buena novela de misterio, elegantemente atmosférica, sobre las complejas relaciones entre los pocos habitantes de un entorno rural que alberga pantanos ancestrales.Their decades of familiarity, which seemed like a comfort at the beginning of last night, weave themselves into an impenetrable thicket; its layers obscure every action and every motivation till they’re near indecipherable to an outsider."

Nevertheless, it is still a very bleak and dark story set against some mountainous surroundings in Ireland with little hope to end with.The descriptions of both settings and characters, the dialogues are all on point and very atmospheric and in itself deteriorates the mystery a little bit, some parts of that just didn't make any sense to me.

It has no aggression to it; its steady rhythm and the scents it brings in through the windows gentle the house’s shabbiness, giving it a homey feel. He’s learned to see the landscape changing under it, greens turning richer and wildflowers rising. It feels like an ally, rather than the annoyance it is in the city.”The Searcher is the second stand-alone novel by award-winning Irish author, Tana French. Cal Hooper is settling into his dilapidated house on a piece of land near the tiny village of Ardnakelty in the west of Ireland. He’s enjoying the challenge of restoring the place to liveable, and walks in the bracing country air. The locals are more welcoming than he had expected, and he looks forward to fishing, hunting rabbits for stew, and making friends with a treeful of rooks.He’s also enjoying the fact that his “mental alarm systems were switched off, the way he wanted them” but, as he works on mending an old desk out in the yard with his grandfather’s tools, “the back of his neck flared. The back of Cal’s neck got trained over twenty-five years in the Chicago PD. He takes it seriously” so he waits patiently until the cause, a young teen, gains the confidence to show a face, and even longer, to make a request: worries over the disappearance, six months earlier, of an older brother, plague this younger sibling. Trey Reddy is convinced that nineteen-year-old Brendan, who would never have left without saying where he was going, has been kidnapped, but the Reddy Family’s poor reputation almost guarantees dismissal by the Guard. Cal considers it likely that the young man has run: either to something better than the village can promise; or from some threat, perhaps for something he has done. Could those Dublin drug boys in the pub be involved? Here, though, Cal has no authority, no resources.Quite contrary his every intention, Cal finds himself making what he believes are subtle enquiries about Brendan Reddy. Of course, in a tiny village like Ardnakelty: “A guy can’t pick his nose around here without the whole townland telling him to wash his hands” and he finds himself on the end of an equally subtle warning off. He’s made Trey a promise: will he now leave it there? Because “It feels like a vast, implacable failing in his character that he can’t come up with just one good solution to offer this scrawny, dauntless kid.”This plays out against a background of hard-drinking local farmers, sheep being mutilated in the night and the youth who don’t escape to the city tending towards either mischief or suicide. And in the back of his mind, forty-eight-year-old Cal is still haunted by the failure of his marriage and concerns for the daughter he has somehow apparently let down.Whatever readers might expect from Tana French, this one is no fast-paced, action-packed thriller; in store is a slow burn read that allows the reader to get to know the protagonist well, to understand this principled ex-cop, his philosophy of life and his observations: “around here mockery is like rain: most of the time it’s either present or incipient, and there are at least a dozen variants, ranging from nurturing to savage, and so subtly distinguished that it would take years to get the hang of them all”. The support cast, too, is a pleasure to meet: quirky villagers of whom Cal takes their measure to tailor his words and actions to fit. Nonetheless, the plot is intriguing, with red herrings and a twist or two to keep it interesting.The Irish landscape itself is a character in this novel, and French’s descriptive prose is often exquisite: “The next morning is all soft mist, dreamy and innocent, pretending yesterday never happened.” With more than one local intent on matchmaking Cal with available women, and a poteen party, there’s plenty of dry and sometimes dark humour, not the least in Cal’s inner monologue, but also in some of the dialogue: “Face on her like a bulldog licking piss off a nettle.” Utterly enthralling.This unbiased review is from an uncorrected proof copy provided by NetGalley and Penguin UK."

The location is remote, surrounded by dark hills and wide brooding skies, and from the first page we are shown danger in the landscape, as some crows peck apart a small creature, possibly a baby rabbit. While Cal works on his cottage, another small creature starts to hang around – a taciturn kid called Trey who helps him with his handiwork. He gets acquainted with the neighbours, and becomes friends of sorts with his closest neighbour Mart, although there is suspicion when word gets out that he used to be a detective. After Trey asks him to find out what happened to her brother Brendan, who is missing, Cal finds himself sucked in to a mystery that it seems no one wants to talk about – and no one wants him to talk about either.This is a book that gets under your skin and haunts you from the start. It’s partly because of the evocative descriptions of the land: the cold, the damp, the noise of the wind, the utter blackness of the nights. The writing is beautiful – never overwritten, but with enough detail so you can feel yourself there. Cal is a man who can handle himself when it comes to the outdoors, and to other types of men, but in this instance he has no idea who the enemy is. There are some gasp-out-loud moments that I’ll never forget. At the end, I looked back and realised everything had slotted cleverly into place. Psychologically, it all made sense. I wouldn’t be at all surprised to hear someone is filming this, but I would recommend you read the book for sheer atmospheric immersion. It’s one of those novels that you rush through work and abandon the chores to get back to. This is the first Tana French novel I’ve read, but I’ll be ordering her others for sure. What a find!"

Keine übermäßige Gewalt, die beschrieben wird, keine nervenaufreibenden Fluchtversuche von irgendwelchen Entführungsopfern, keine langen Verfolgungsjagden oder ähnliches.

If I had never read French's Dublin Murder Squad books, I'd probably be even more effusive. This author writes like a dream. Perhaps I was expecting too much, so I feel just a tiny bit disappointed, which is ridiculous as this is a fine mystery.As I have observed many times, setting a mystery in a small community is the most efficient method. Fewer people to sort through for the sleuth and the reader. Plus you get to include the history of the people who live in this village and the impulse among the villagers to shut out the foreigner. Cal, as a retired American detective, is about as much of a stranger in rural Ireland as anyone could be. I've lived in a small community, though not so small as this one. It's true, you know who deals the drugs, who's allergic to work, who's on the dole, who beats his wife and/or his kids. You know who is related to whom. It can be hard for the outsider to keep track of all these details. Cal misjudges his neighbours and conversely they don't realize how he is going to react either, causing more issues than either side thought there would be.I'm pretty sure that French introduces a flock of rooks in Cal's back yard as a mirror to village life. They are hard to win over, skeptical, and wary. Cal often interprets their calls as derisive. They appear at book's beginning and end to make the full circle.French did her usual thing, surprising me with little switcheroos. Maybe not a full scale twists, but definitely events that made me shake my head and refocus my eyes. Agatha Christie does that to me too, so she is in good company. And like In the Woods, she doesn't wrap everything up neatly or answer every question and I love that. I have yet to read The Trespasser, I started it once and got stuck. This makes me think that I should return to it and take another run at it.Cross posted at my blog:https://wanda-thenextfifty.blogspot.c..."
198,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4428094-fictionophile,Rating 5 out of 5,"This novel had three of my vital requirements in a novel: strong characterization, appealing setting, and a compelling plot.Set in a rural location in the West of Ireland, it evoked misty green fields, the smoke from peat fires, birdsong, and fresh air.Cal Hooper, the protagonist, was a great character. Strong in moral ethics, worldly-wise, and seeking sanctuary from a life that has been less than kind, he exudes a kind of calm, quiet strength. He is an outsider, a newcomer, who is under constant invisible scrutiny by his neighbours. And hey, he drinks my favourite Irish beer!Trey Reddy was a character that pulled at your heart-strings. I loved the way Cal bonded with Trey in a fatherly/friendly manner. Both characters were damaged, yet together they formed a bond that I am confident will eventually heal them both.The plot was a page turner which divulged that even the most bucolic places often hide dark and nasty underbellies. The masterful and eloquent writing evoked the menace and unease which contrasted greatly with the tame and idyllic setting. The book spoke to how justice is not always clear-cut, and that sometimes rural justice is a different kettle of fish altogether...There was one shocking plot revelation that surprised me as much as it did the protagonist, Cal Hooper.I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and though I know it is a stand-alone novel, would love to see the characters of Cal Hooper and Trey Reddy return in later books.Highly recommended!"

Parker’s Jesse Stone here - one of my favourite actors and characters of all time so no bad thing - and that likeness continued for the whole book. The characters kept me interested, Cal in particular of course, and the dialogue is terrific. I could well imagine the Irish backwater Jesse, oops I mean Cal, pitches up in after a burnt-out career in the police and a failed marriage. The plot, though, is so slow and not very thrilling that I was on the verge on losing interest on a few occasions. As a vehicle for exploring small-town life and broken families it worked well enough and the author has great insights to share, but I finished the book feeling relieved that it was over. A tad disappointing for me.With thanks to Penguin, Viking via NetGalley for the opportunity to read an ARC."

Take a look at that page count - that is a lot of highway to travel with no snacks.To be a ""slow burn"" something has to burn. This is a book that should be more plot oriented but is way too character driven for its own good. It's not one or the other, you can do both. This one could have stood a lot more plottiness - there's virtually no mystery and no investigation, just some aw shucks salt of the earth simpleton former detective moping around like he's some muddle-headed Miss Marple. So don't feel like the character focus is helping things here. I almost gave it 3 stars but the hick-stained viewpoint that informs the resolution (and much of the dialogue) should dock a solid star off it."

Rather Cal is a retired cop from Chicago who just moved to rural Ireland and gets caught up in a missing person search on his own, with no resources at all.It's about Cal, his backstory and his personal growth as much as it is about 13-year-old Trey whose brother is missing.Cal has a personal ""code"", a sense of what is right and wrong and needs to abide by that code regardless of whether it coincides with the law. In that respect, he reminds me of Robert Parker's Spenser. I wouldn't be surprised if Call appeared in another Tanya French novel soon. He's a complex character with more than one-book potential."

This is my first Tana French mystery and it kept me turning pages. She is a brilliant writer and I will definitely be back for more of her books. This book is not part of a series, but it could and should be. I loved the descriptions of the small Irish town and countryside, especially as a place to ""get away from it all."" However, this book is a reminder to me of why I wouldn't choose to live in a small town or community anywhere. Visit, yes; live, no. There are too many secrets and back stories that remain hidden if you are an outsider.

The food descriptions were as flat as the characters. Ugh. I know lots of readers loved this book, but it was a chore to return to it. No book should ever be a chore.

It has no aggression to it; its steady rhythm and the scents it brings in through the windows gentle the house’s shabbiness, giving it a homey feel. He’s learned to see the landscape changing under it, greens turning richer and wildflowers rising. It feels like an ally, rather than the annoyance it is in the city.”The Searcher is the second stand-alone novel by award-winning Irish author, Tana French. The audio version is narrated by Roger Clark. Cal Hooper is settling into his dilapidated house on a piece of land near the tiny village of Ardnakelty in the west of Ireland. He’s enjoying the challenge of restoring the place to liveable, and walks in the bracing country air. The locals are more welcoming than he had expected, and he looks forward to fishing, hunting rabbits for stew, and making friends with a treeful of rooks.He’s also enjoying the fact that his “mental alarm systems were switched off, the way he wanted them” but, as he works on mending an old desk out in the yard with his grandfather’s tools, “the back of his neck flared. The back of Cal’s neck got trained over twenty-five years in the Chicago PD. He takes it seriously” so he waits patiently until the cause, a young teen, gains the confidence to show a face, and even longer, to make a request: worries over the disappearance, six months earlier, of an older brother, plague this younger sibling.Trey Reddy is convinced that nineteen-year-old Brendan, who would never have left without saying where he was going, has been kidnapped, but the Reddy Family’s poor reputation almost guarantees dismissal by the Guard. Cal considers it likely that the young man has run: either to something better than the village can promise; or from some threat, perhaps for something he has done. Could those Dublin drug boys in the pub be involved? Here, though, Cal has no authority, no resources.Quite contrary his every intention, Cal finds himself making what he believes are subtle enquiries about Brendan Reddy. Of course, in a tiny village like Ardnakelty: “A guy can’t pick his nose around here without the whole townland telling him to wash his hands” and he finds himself on the end of an equally subtle warning off. He’s made Trey a promise: will he now leave it there? Because “It feels like a vast, implacable failing in his character that he can’t come up with just one good solution to offer this scrawny, dauntless kid.”This plays out against a background of hard-drinking local farmers, sheep being mutilated in the night and the youth who don’t escape to the city tending towards either mischief or suicide. And in the back of his mind, forty-eight-year-old Cal is still haunted by the failure of his marriage and concerns for the daughter he has somehow apparently let down.Whatever readers might expect from Tana French, this one is no fast-paced, action-packed thriller; in store is a slow burn read that allows the reader to get to know the protagonist well, to understand this principled ex-cop, his philosophy of life and his observations: “around here mockery is like rain: most of the time it’s either present or incipient, and there are at least a dozen variants, ranging from nurturing to savage, and so subtly distinguished that it would take years to get the hang of them all”. The support cast, too, is a pleasure to meet: quirky villagers of whom Cal takes their measure to tailor his words and actions to fit. Nonetheless, the plot is intriguing, with red herrings and a twist or two to keep it interesting.The Irish landscape itself is a character in this novel, and French’s descriptive prose is often exquisite: “The next morning is all soft mist, dreamy and innocent, pretending yesterday never happened.” With more than one local intent on matchmaking Cal with available women, and a poteen party, there’s plenty of dry and sometimes dark humour, not the least in Cal’s inner monologue, but also in some of the dialogue: “Face on her like a bulldog licking piss off a nettle.” Utterly enthralling."

This would have worked as a novella or even a short story, but there were at least 100 wasted pages. I nearly gave up when we were treated to details about how thick a slice of bread was. The only mystery in this entire novel was completely ruined for me by another GR reviewer who failed to employ a spoiler alert, although I may have twigged to it anyway given the boatload of details about the character in question. Another site that hands out starred reviews promised ""plenty of twists, shocking revelations, and truly chilling moments"" but for some reason I must have slept through all the excitement because there wasn't any. Another reviewer called this a western, which from my memories of those entail a white American who rides into town, shoots a lot of injuns, saves the townsfolk who are too weak/dumb/lazy to solve their own problems, and gets the girl. I'm really curious about the reactions of the author's Irish readers to an American character straightening out the locals in a rather corrupt Irish village. Of course if anyone complained, we can always remind them that the US has won all the wars they've deigned to join in on for the last, oh, 250 years, so we really can't complain about a literary reminder of their might and strength, right? Colour me disappointed. 2.5 stars rounded up to 3 because I was able to finish it.Edited to add that this book reminded me of, and prompted me to reread, God Bless the Child by Robert B. Parker. An American PI on his own turf."

The idyllic rural Irish setting begins to simmer with hidden menace, “like light flashing on a river, with who knows what underneath”.For me Tana French takes her latest novel to a whole new level, and also into new territory - she says this is her take on a Western with a nod to the John Ford classic “The Searchers”.Her hero is Chicago cop Cal Cooper, divorced, partly estranged from his daughter, and retired from a force he’s not sure he fits into any more. Seeking a new life, he buys a rundown cottage in the Irish countryside and sets about fixing it up. But experience tells him he’s being watched. Trey, a 13-year-old kid from a dirt-poor family, wants Cal to find out what happened to his older brother. Local police wrote off Brendan’s disappearance as another youngster leaving for greener pastures.Cal is the lone hero trying to do the right thing but without the resources he relied on throughout his career. He has to go about this investigation a whole different way, knowing he could upset his new neighbours whose ways he has yet to understand. They are vivid characters, their banter full of humour, but they know how to close ranks against the outsider. In a memorable pub scene, they get Cal drunk on the local poteen and, beneath the teasing, deliver a clear message for him to back off.But Cal made a promise to a lonely teen. French describes skilfully the developing relationship between the kid who lacks a father figure, and the man who came in search of a quiet life but finds he needs human connection.This isn’t a fast-paced thriller. It doesn’t need to be. I think it’s sheer reading pleasure just the way it is."

219,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8014692-natura,Rating 3 out of 5,"Un thriller apacible, muy local y muy irlandés en el que los tópicos no siempre son lo que parecen, ni acaban en topicazos.Partiendo de una situación inofensiva y de lo más vulgar, como es la jubilación de un policía y su decisión de dejar la gran ciudad de Chicago para enterrarse en un pueblucho irlandés, llegaremos a reconocer todo un mosaico de personajes mucho menos simples de lo que aparentan. La trama gira en torno a un “idílico” paraje y a la búsqueda de la propia identidad de dos de los protagonistas: Cal, el ex-policía, y Trecy, que a sus 13 años ya ha tenido que lidiar con cosas al borde de recurrir a la asistencia social. Pero es al forastero al que busca para solucionar su pequeño drama familiar, y será este el que desencadene, en plan bola de nieve, un montón de acontecimientos inesperados para un lugar tan supuestamente poco conflictivo.La naturaleza, como siempre con esta autora, tiene mucha importancia. Se nota que conoce de lo que habla, y que está enamorada de su país natal, aunque no hasta el punto de no saber ver el lado oscuro que contrarresta tanto verdor. Y los personajes que crea son complejos, muy de darles vueltas a las cosas, sobre todo los protagonistas.Toda la acción transcurre sin grandes sobresaltos, dándole tanta importancia a la trama como a las relaciones, y reacciones humanas, para terminar con un desenlace tan lógico como abierto. La condición humana es así de imprevisible, pero la lógica, para bien o para mal, suele presidirlo casi todo.Muy entretenida, aunque le falta algo más de thriller y le sobra un pelín de “psicológico”."
220,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24187089-ruby,Rating 2 out of 5,"This story had some potential but the writing was not gripping at all and packed with clichés. In every bland ""interview"" with the townspeople Cal gets an unfathomable amount of personal information with limited push back. I would have liked to see the convos play out over a few trips to the pub or multiple encounters to get some tension going and characters develop. It was like reading a lazier version of Strange Shores, the final book in the Inspector Erlendur series by Arnaldur Indridason - ex/off duty divorced cop, village setting, investigating a disappearance set against a somber landscape, progress on the mystery hinges on chats with the local townsfolk. Also this is maybe the 5th or 6th Tana French book I've read and I've hit my limit with the cop character with a ridiculously aggressive outlook on life in general. It's not just hard to care about the characters when they are written that way, it's also just plain tiresome. The hardened city cop cliché character placed in a village where he is anonymous is exhausting."
221,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66817773-amy-meyerson,No Rating,"I adore Tana French, but for me, reading a Tana French novel involves a bit of skimming. I want to find out what happens so badly that I'll speed through the longer conversations, the more intricate scene setting. With The Searcher, however, I (mostly) listened to the novel. Thus, no skimming. And, resisting the temptation to race ahead to find out what happened to Brendan made this novel all the better. The characters are rich and original. Their conversations are as entertaining as the mystery itself. The setting is memorable and atmospheric. This book is a slow burn but one to enjoy, word by word. "

230,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24679550-ash-spaceyreads,Rating 4 out of 5,"Cal Hooper, described as someone who looks more like a biker than a cop - with a messy beard and menacing stance - is an American police officer who retired early and decided to move to a small town in Ireland for some peace and quiet. He just doesn't want any trouble. However, trouble seems to have found him anyway, in the form of Trey, a teenager who wants to find their brother, who disappeared without a trace sometime ago, and now wants Cal's help finding him. French, as always, is magical with her craft, and it's a treat in itself to witness it. She beautifully takes us through the relationship between Cal and Trey, an unlikely pair, trying to find out what happened without arousing the neighbourly outrage of the small and claustrophobic town, who prefers to keep outsiders out of things. Her last book, 
The Wych Elm
, was timely situated in the middle of the world catching on to the latest wave of identity politics and understanding of oppression. The Searcher similarly gently confronts the reader with a new contemporary issue - American policing and the growing public scrutiny on police brutality.While I found the insertion of American politics into a book about a small town Irish mystery a little heavyhanded (and this is coming from someone who likes social commentary) and a trifle bit awkward, I enjoyed witnessing how she did it, and quite frankly, it was wrapped up very nicely.""Cal reached the point a long time ago where those words will make him tired for all of humanity. All the innocents say that, and believe it to the bone, right up until the moment when they can't any more.  My husband would never do that to our children, my baby ain't no thief.  Cal feels like he ought to stand on a street corner handing our warnings, little pieces of paper that just say: Anyone can do anything.""I was surprised to find that I've grown to like the character of Cal the cop. He was reluctantly dragged into caring for a young neighbour, distanced from his own family and adult daughter; ironically, whatever was going on with Trey allow him to recreate what he did for his daughter Alissa, when she was badly mugged a while back, but with a nice touch of character growth, a sort of redemption for the things he did wrong the last time, a private and quiet shifting of his understand of the world.This review by Vox opines that French is demonstrating, in many words, what restorative justice looks like and what people mean when they say defund the police. A very interesting analysis.Though the opposite also does hold some truth for me - that enough space has been given to glorifying male heroes, to upholding the status quo, and this is just another story intentionally glorifying a male cop who believes he is a good cop and doesn't understand these newfangled sensitivity things that they are being asked to do (Literally. There was a bit about morals in there and how Cal believes he just knows the right thing to do.)Lastly, I enjoyed reading this interview with French herself about her thoughts and process for the book. Overall, it was a great book. I was immersed in lush Irish fields and small town quaintness. I could picture it so clearly with quotes like these:
“The morning has turned lavishly beautiful. The autumn sun gave the greens of the fields an impossible, mythic radiance and transformed the back roads into light-muddled paths where a goblin with a fiddle, or a pretty maiden with a basket, could be waiting around every game and-bramble bend.""
I felt so close to all of the characters, like I could almost hear them speak. Again, a quintessential French touch.Very touching and a beautiful read."

A very different, slower-paced, read to those by French that I’ve read before but it has a curious charm.

He wants a peaceful life, but finds himself caught up in a situation he can’t walk away from.Young Trey comes from a local family not known of for their good decisions. Trey’s brother went missing earlier in the year, and Cal is curious enough to do some searching. Of course he gets himself caught up in some strange shenanigans, and those around him harbour a few secrets of their own. We do get answers, though not quite what we expected. Cal makes some curious decisions and in spite of the bleak subject, there were some positives to this. Rural idyll it might not be, but it certainly showed a charm of its own..."

It will likely end up being one of the most visually striking and memorable books I've read in a handful of years. I'm trying to think of a contemporary author better at realistic world-building than French and I can't. I'm trying to think of an author better at slow burn character-building than French, and nope, can't do that, either. This book is really fucking good. A cozy mystery more than a thriller, for sure, and not particularly high-stakes. I love that about it. I honestly loved almost everything about it. French has a way of turning a phrase, whether on the page or in a character's mouth, that stops me in my tracks and makes me let out a contented sigh. I did that a lot reading this one. [Five stars for Cal and Trey and Lena and an Irish countryside come to life as fully formed and vital as any main character.] "

He develops a mentor relationship with a troubled teen named Trey, who has a secret. Cal decides to help Trey and uses his detective skills to Search for clues and answers. The book is beautifully written, but a slow burn for sure. I listened to the audio for the accents and it was well done. There are some twists and turns and a satisfactory ending to the story."
235,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28105228-alison-hardtmann,Rating 4 out of 5,"A Chicago police officer, newly divorced and recently retired, decides he wants a quiet life and so he buys a run-down cottage in rural Ireland. Cal's doing pretty well, slowly renovating his house and getting to know the neighbors - mostly older farmers - when a young member of the infamous Reddy family shows up. Trey has heard that Cal's a police officer and needs his help finding someone. As Cal looks into the disappearance and gets to know his young neighbor, his plans for a quiet retirement start to fall apart. This is another stand-alone mystery by Tana French. It's well-plotted and the characters are achingly real, as they always are in her novels. Because the main character is American, this has a bit of an Ireland for Foreigners feel to it, but not so much as to be overly intrusive. This is an enjoyable book for a rainy evening or two. The crime itself is secondary to the story of a stranger to a community making connections and learning about himself, but Cal's an interesting enough character to spend time with. "

Why, really, did he retire from the Chicago PD? Why, really, did he and Donna get divorced (and him concurrently become estranged from his daughter who is obviously a daddy's girl)? Why, really, did he pick ""Whatevertetly Village, Ireland Proper"" as his retirement home? What was with all that North Carolina squirrel hunting mess? (NOTE FOR THE RECORD: My daddy and my grandpas and uncles hunted squirrel for food, and I live in the American Deep South, so if you think I'm judging [which, obviously I am], please know that I am judging from a real-life perspective.)And, why, if he really was all that and a bag of chips in the CPD, did he not pick up on the fookin' obvious?Ah, but Mart? Aye, then......Also I had it all figured it out at least halfway through, except for the surprise that was intentional from the get-go. (Dirty Pool Ms French & Editors, Dirty Pool)If you want to traipse about Ireland in the mists for a bit, feel like you're about to be sucked down into a peat bog, enjoy the sunrises and sunsets and a good cup of coffee and a nice cold beer (not to mention a tin whistle at a pub), then have on with yourself. But don't go in expecting to be transported, as it were, like with Faithful Place and The Witch Elm.At least it was better than The Trespasser, though!Having said all that.....let's lift a pint to Ms French.

240,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27454238-jamie-canaves,Rating 4 out of 5,"For those who are unaware of Tana French, she has a great police procedural series–each book can be read as a standalone novel–following detectives on the Dublin Murder Squad. She also has a standalone suspense murder mystery, The Witch Elm, and now The Searcher, a second standalone, which is a slow burn, possible missing persons mystery.If you like procedurals, character driven stories, and want a faster pace, you want her Dublin Murder Squad books. If you want to sink deep into a life and have a murder mystery filled with suspense, you want The Witch Elm. If you want to be plunged into a life in a tiny town that is a slow burn possible missing person case, you want The Searcher. I love all her books and feel like a main theme is they should have a trigger warning for men. And by that I mean, if you think about the male leads, they are presented as “nice guys” but they’re kind of terrible.Case in point: in The Searcher we meet Cal Hooper, a retired American detective, who is divorced and a father to an adult woman. He has a not-great relationship with his ex and his daughter, and he retired pretty young from the police force. He wants to have a better relationship with his wife and is certainly trying to have a good relationship with his daughter, so naturally he moves alone to a remote village in rural Ireland to work on those things while they are in the U.S. You see what I mean? And why did he retire early you wonder? Because he was coming to understand the Black Lives Matter movement and it was too difficult for him to wade through all of it to make any kind of decision, so retiring early seemed the best plan. You see!Welcome to the life we’re plunged into. And by that I mean this was one of the few books this year that truly transported me out of the hellscape we are in and took me somewhere else. Cal may have moved away from all his problems but as he will soon discover, life is hard no matter where you go, and you’re going to have to make tough decisions, buddy! His comes in the form of a young teen named Trey who he keeps catching lurking around his property as he tries to fix the cottage. Trey is like a stray that will not leave and will not give up and forces Cal to do something about his inability to make hard decisions because Trey is convinced their brother did not pack up and leave, and Cal, being a detective and all, has to be able to help.Problem is, small towns aren’t real big on outsiders to start with let alone ones that show up and start poking their nose into a mystery they claim isn’t a mystery… If you like slow unraveling mysteries, character studies, excellent writing, and want to live in rural Ireland while getting to know the locals (and all their gossip and secrets) this one is for you. I find myself once again longing for the next Tana French–always my feeling as I turn the last page of one of her crime books.

Cal Hooper, emerytowany policjant z Chicago kupuje dom do remontu na irlandzkiej wsi i przeprowadza się tam, żeby wyciszyć serce i umysł spędzając pozostałą część życia spokojnie, blisko natury, z dala od świateł. Pewnego dnia jego gliniarski instynkt znów się budzi, a na karku pojawia znajomy chłód, kiedy orientuje się, że jest obserwowany. Zastawiwszy pułapkę, odnosi sukces i chwyta intruza. Okazuje się nim jednak kilkunastoletnie, mizerne i zaniedbane, dziecko. Oczywiście nie kręci się przy Calu bez powodu - kilka miesięcy wcześniej zaginął jego starszy brat, wszyscy uważają, że uciekł w poszukiwaniu lepszego życia, ale Trey w to nie wierzy. Cal wydaje się najlepszą osobą aby sprawdzić co się wydarzyło. Jak się okazuje, nie tak łatwo zamienić gliniarza w farmera, szczególnie jeśli cierpi na syndrom superbohatera i musi zawsze kogoś zbawiać, więc pomimo pewnych oporów Amerykanin angażuje się w sprawę i zaczyna prowadzić dyskretne śledztwo. Pytanie tylko czy w małej społeczności możliwa jest dyskrecja i czy na pewno sąsiedzi chcą, żeby obcy wtykał nos w ich sprawy? Oczywiście śledztwo, jak to u Tany French, toczy się bardzo powoli i nie jest najistotniejszym elementem historii, chociaż udało jej się stworzyć świetną atmosferę i trzymała mnie w napięciu od pierwszych do ostatnich stron. Przede wszystkim „Z dala od świateł” to opowieść o Irlandii, ale nie z perspektywy Dublinu, tylko tej prowincjonalnej, gdzie więcej owiec niż ludzi, wiatr hula po pustkowiach i przynosi zmiany, na które nikt nie czeka. Świetne studium małej wiejskiej społeczności i praw nią rządzących, z wyczuwalnym duchem Jante, i wyraźnie zarysowanymi przemianami społecznymi, które jej nie sprzyjają, albo może raczej to wieś za nimi nie nadąża. Tym razem bardzo polubiłam protagonistę, jest mądry i doświadczony, stawia na rozum, nie mięśnie, ma w sobie dużo szacunku. Bardzo podobało mi się jak budował relacje w nowym otoczeniu, nie tylko z sąsiadami, ale też jak mądrze i z ogromnym wyczuciem oswoił „dzikie dziecko”. Do tego oczywiście fascynujące opisy irlandzkich krajobrazów i pogody i wszystko tak pięknie napisane.To moja kolejna w krótkim czasie lektura o Zielonej Wyspie i mam wrażenie, że coraz lepiej ją rozumiem, coraz bardziej też chciałabym się tam trochę powłóczyć.Bardzo się cieszę, że czytając cykl dubliński nie rzuciłam się od razu na wszystko co Tana French stworzyła i miałam do czego wrócić. Bardzo za nią tęskniłam, więc z ekscytacją wyglądam kolejnego tomu tego cyklu, który ma wyjść w marcu, nie wiem nawet czy będę czekała na polski przekład (Wydawnictwo Albatros raczej nie przykłada do tej kwestii zbyt dużej wagi). Gdybym znała więcej takich pisarek myślę, że mogłabym czytać tylko takie książki przez cały rok z przyjemnością."

I’ve been pretty distracted for the last few days while I wait to hear back after an interview I did, but this book is pretty much the only thing that’s managed to solidly distract me. Go Tana French!Her last standalone book, The Witch Elm, was kind of a letdown, so I went into this with low expectations. The Searcher isn’t quite a standout gem like the Dublin Murder Squad series, but it’s still a great read that does the job.48-year-old Calvin ‘Cal’ Hooper (who I think might be the oldest protagonist I’ve ever encountered) is a retired police officer. Having spent 25 years in the Chicago PD, he’s ended up with nothing to show for it but a wife who’s divorced him and an adult daughter who barely speaks to him. Impulse drives him to buy an abandoned farmhouse in the rural Irish village of Ardnakelty, where he spends his days fixing the house up and chatting with his neighbour Mart.It’s an idyllic existence. But then he starts feeling like he’s being watched. When he finally catches the spy, it turns out to be 13-year-old Trey Reddy, a kid from the local ‘bad family’ who seems to want something from Cal. Slowly, painstakingly, Cal coaxes the truth out of Trey: his older brother Brendan has been missing for months and Trey wants Cal to find him.Cal’s first impulse is to refuse. He’s retired, for one. For another, here he’s nothing but a stranger, with none of the technical know-how and backup he had in Chicago. As a flighty 19-year-old it’s more than likely that Brendan simply ran off. But Trey needs him to at least look, so Cal finally gives in and starts a quiet investigation. What seemed to be a cut-and-dried runaway case quickly spirals into something far more unpredictable – and violent – than he could ever have expected.
The first 45% of this book is very slow
, to the point where I was starting to wonder if anything would actually happen. It turns out that ALL the action is just packed into the second half of the book. It doesn’t feel unbalanced, necessarily, but you definitely have to sit tight and wait patiently for the plot to take off.Once it does, though, it’s excellent. No jaw-dropping plot twists – there’s too much heavy foreshadowing for anything to come as a real shock – but a tightly-woven-together story that was gripping enough to stave off my sleep until I’d finished.
The atmosphere is great.
 French has a real gift for lyrical, evocative descriptions, and she brought it to bear on all the passages serenading the Irish countryside. Characterisation felt slightly shallow at times, perhaps because Cal isn’t very given to introspection, but I didn’t mind being in his (third person) head.
Overall
Another great read from French, pretty much in her usual style."
243,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7061409-kate,Rating 2 out of 5,"I love Tana French, but man, 2020 is not the year for this book. Our protagonist and POV character, Cal, is a Chicago cop who retires early in a fit of conscience after his patrol partner nearly shoots an unarmed Black teenager (#heartwarming!), and then fucks off to a little dilapidated cottage in rural Ireland, there to conduct a one-man version of Extreme Makeover: Feelings Edition. He bears with him the pain of a failèd marriage, and his grandfather's tool set. It is all very noble. And yet.A Chicago cop!I suppose if you came to this book having spent all of your life in a cave, Cal might feel plausible as a hero, and his gee-shucks, good-people-on-both-sides analysis of racial dynamics in contemporary American policing might seem commonsensical rather than FUCKING DELUDED. ""Black people got mad about being treated like crap. Bad cops got mad ’cause they were getting called on their shit all of a sudden. Good cops got mad ’cause they were the bad guys when they hadn’t done anything,"" Cal says, to which the only response is fuck off, Cal, jesus god. It's unclear on what grounds Cal has been able to immigrate to Ireland, especially as he doesn't have Irish ancestry--perhaps there's a Fulfils Essential Plot Function visa?--but once he's settled himself in the tiny village of Ardnakelty he is quickly welcomed into the heart of the community. Of course, because this is Tana French, the secondary characters are all beautifully drawn and even the ones who seem suspiciously central casting at first have real psychological depth and presence; and there is a mystery; and there are satisfying red herrings; and Cal must make imperfect choices and wrestle with his own thoughts on morality and Confront His Past and all that. Also there are very nice descriptions of the scenery, and French's trademark excellent dialogue. But the choice to centre the narrative on Cal, without actually engaging with his complicity in a system that tortures and murders Black people, largely with impunity, means that for me it does not and cannot work as a story. Cal would have an indulgent shake of his head for me I'm sure."

245,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6849920-nancy-goldberg-wilks,Rating 5 out of 5," Tana French's latest novel is The Searcher. Like her last novel, The Witch Elm, and unlike her Dublin Murder Squad series, it is a standalone novel. And, it is another blockbuster.  In The Searcher, we meet Cal Hooper, a retired police officer from Chicago. As Cal wanted a change, he bought a place to fix up in a remote Irish village. Although he finds the beauty and relative simplicity he is seeking, an unsolved mystery nonetheless finds him. Tana French is a master of character development. Not only does she create and beautifully describe complex characters, but she demonstrates an understanding of the seamy underside of humanity. And, The Searcher further epitomizes French's ability. Although The Searcher is considered a mystery, it seems to me that the mystery that finds and occupies Cal is incidental to French's magnificent character study. The Searcher is a fabulous read, and I highly recommend it."

I just had to skim some of it. I love Tana French's other novels so much. I've read them all this year and gave 5 stars to most.Writing in third person seemed awkward here. She has previously been so successful using the first-person narrative.Nothing really happened in the story. A lot of description of the landscape that became repetitive.My explanation for this novel edging on dreadful is that Ms. French was kidnapped and held hostage until she churned out a manuscript.Or maybe this should be YA.The biggest plot twist was not believable. If a 25-year veteran of a major US city police force is that thick, something has gone wrong.If Cal called Trey ""kid"" one more time, I was going to scream.I found the American vernacular awkward.I can't remember the last time it took me this long to read a book. And then when the reveal(s) came, I didn't get it.  Also, I didn't really buy that Cal could so easily understand a rural Irish accent.Also could someone please tell me how the twist with Trey happened--did I miss something leading that way or was it really just out of the blue?Cal is one of the most clueless characters I've read in quite a while."

There was NONE of her usual teeth-grinding, ""should I read this alone in the house"" titillating suspense and creepiness. There was actually NO suspense. Disappointing.I'd also argue there's not much of a plot. And there's a very confusing American character who's way too quaint and naive to be a retired Chicago cop, no matter WHERE he grew up. And his diction, though she cited a dialect coach, was not recognizable as 2020 American anywhere I know. Certainly not Chicago. Then there's Trey, who barely says anything. Aside from a few outbursts, we learn Trey's entire character through other character's expositions. That's cheating.If this were a debut mystery novel, and about 50 pages shorter, I might have really enjoyed it. The prose and the setting are lovely. And it has a happy ending. (Of sorts.) But I expect a LOT more complexity from Tana French. I wonder if her publisher rushed her to get a book out in 2020 while everyone is stuck at home. The money made from this mediocre book wasn't worth ruining her reputation."
248,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7784893-henry,Rating 5 out of 5,"French's latest book is an excellent page-turner set in Ireland. Cal, a retired Chicago cop in his 40's, moves to a small Irish village and begins rehabbing an old house he now owns. He's had with Chicago and this quiet, beautiful setting suits him just fine! Then life intrudes. Sheep are mutilated on neighboring farms, and there is no murder squad in this place either! As usual a great read a great author!"

This is the third book of hers I've read, quieter than the other two, but every bit as wise about human beings struggling to do the right thing. It's written in close third person. Cal is a Chicago cop who is burned by the sense he's losing his way, that defining the line between righteousness and sin is not clear anymore. But he has his 25 years and lost his wife to divorce, his daughter is in Seattle, and he wants a small, quiet place. He buys a tiny and deserted country house in Ireland and moves there to see about making a new life where he isn't a cop. Trouble finds him, and he can't help but use his skills to go about sorting the truth... but doing the right thing isn't as clear as it was years ago. No explosions, no car chases, a gun, families in trouble, people all trying to do their best and often failing. Real life.I will look for another French novel and expect I'll enjoy that one too. And the one after that."

I couldn’t tell if it was actually keeping me interested or I was just reading it because it was an author I love. I love her police procedurals with the Dublin Murder Squad. They are a really interesting mix of crime story and character portrait. But now it seems like she decided to throw out any real story and just write character portraits. What this one and the Witch Elm were were boring, slow and pretty much pointless. Why did I just read 400 pages about this guy? I don’t know. I really don’t. The characters were flat and you could see the plot a mile away. And the plot “twist” felt like a cheap trick. I think this is what happens when your writing gets wrapped up in politics.

That being said, when she finally found the voice and rhythm, it was lovely in all the ways I usually find her work lovely, especially in the platonic, important development of relationships between men and women. I loved the relationship between the protagonist and the sibling of the missing person—as good as any flawed detective partners and as intense and generous. I would recommend this book to anyone who already loves her books, but I don’t think it would be a good introductory novel. "

I have been hovering between 4 and 5 stars for this read. I thought the main characters were really intriguing people, but some of the more 'thriller' aspects of the story were sometimes a bit much so I settled on 4, but a very high 4 indeed.

259,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/307208-lucy,Rating 4 out of 5,"Cal Hooper, an ex-cop from Chicago, moves to a small town in Ireland to get away from it all. His wife left him, his only daughter is grown, living across the country and with her boyfriend and doesn't need him anymore. And he's tired of all the anti-police sentiment happening in America. In Ireland, he buys a run-down, abandoned cottage and spends his days fixing it up and sometimes chatting with his older next-door neighbor. After getting over halfway through this novel, I wondered if anything...I don't know...bad or stressful was ever going to happen. The initial tenseness occurred when Cal started hearing strange noises around his cottage and had the feeling he was being watched but it resolved quickly and easily when he reeled in his stalker, a surly 13 year-old truant named Trey Reddy. Trey comes from a dysfunctional family who live in a shack up the hill and the regular town folks don't respect or care much about. After a couple of weeks of hanging about and helping Cal with fixing up a broken desk, Trey finally asks/begs then bullies Cal to use his cop skills to find out what happened to 19 year-old Brendan Reddy, an older brother who has been missing for about 6 months. Cal's developed a soft spot for the neglected and awkward teen and reluctantly agrees to help. To note, it took almost 6 hours of listening for all of that to happen (I had the audiobook version so my progress is measured in time instead of pages). Hours! The writing was great and I honestly wasn't bored but when I checked my progress and I was halfway through and no crime had been committed, no body discovered and nobody besides Trey at all concerned about Brendan's absence, I felt...peevish. What kind of book is this? I've read most of Tana French's Dublin Murder Squad series and I wrongly assumed when I selected  The Searcher that I would be getting a similar whodunit-esque book. Nope.While this story eventually peels away layers to a crime, the crime never takes center stage. Instead, French wrote a book about morality. Why does anybody do what they do? That question is explored through the behaviors of many secondary characters but Cal and his ""code"" are the main focus. One thing that kind of bugged me throughout the book was the unexplained reason why Cal was helping Trey at all? He retired from police work. He didn't know this kid. He didn't know Brendan, who was missing. There didn't seem to be a strong enough motive to get involved. Then I remembered the title. Aahh. He's a searcher. And he tries to do the right thing. It's deeper than that but it helped me get past the weak motive. Ultimately, I ended up really liking this book because it was a satisfying character driven story that didn't use a story of morality to lecture me about what I'm supposed to think. The reading is so easy without the writing being simplistic. Here is one of my favorite parts of the book, talking about the difference between etiquette, manners and morals:""Cal finds himself uncomfortable with this conversation. It brings back things that put a bad taste in his mouth. Over the last few years, it's been brought home to him that the boundaries between morals, manner and etiquette, which have always seemed crystal clear to him, may not look the same to everyone else. He hears talk about the immorality of young people nowadays, but it seems to him that Alyssa (his daughter) and Ben (her boyfriend) and their friends spend plenty of their time concentrating on right and wrong. The thing is, that many of their most passionate moral stances, as far as Cal can see, have to do with what words you should and shouldn't use for people based on what problems they have...what race they are or....who they like to sleep with. While Cal agrees that you should call people whatever they prefer to be called, he considers this to be a question of basic manners...not of morals. This outraged Ben enough that he stormed out of Cal and Donna's (his ex-wife) house in the middle of Thanksgiving dessert, with Alyssa in tears running after him and it took him an hour to cool down enough to come back in. In Cal’s view, morals involve something more than terminology. Ben damn near lost his mind over the importance of using the proper terms for people in wheelchairs and he clearly felt pretty proud of himself for doing that, but he didn't mention ever doing anything useful for one single person in one single wheelchair and Cal would bet a year's pension that the little twerp would have brought it up if he had. And on top of that, the right terms change every few years, so that someone who thinks like Ben has to be always listening for other people to tell him what’s moral or immoral now. It seems to Cal that this isn’t how a man or a woman goes about having a sense of right and wrong. He tried putting it down to him getting middle aged and grumpy about young people these days but then the department went the same way. They brought in a mandatory sensitive training session, which was fine by Cal, given the way some of the guys treated, for example, witnesses from bad hoods and rape victims, except the session turned out to be all about what words they were and weren't allowed to use. Nothing about what they were doing underneath all the words how they can do it better. Everyone was always talking about talking and the most moral person was the one who yelled at the most other people for doing the talking all wrong. “Morals” is the stuff that does’t change. The stuff you do no matter what other people do.""Which leaves the question: What are your morals?"

261,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69519261-keri-stone,No Rating,"Cal Hooper is retired from the Chicago police force, and moving on after a divorce, so he’d moved to a small town in Ireland. He is fixing up his dilapidated little cottage, getting to know his neighbors, and enjoying the quiet life. When he needs some variety he’ll walk to the pub, but otherwise he’s pretty much of a loner. A local kid starts hanging around and tells him of his missing brother, and Cal is slowly pulled in to doing some investigating. As he does, he realized some dark undercurrents in his quiet town. I enjoyed Cal and his relationship with the kid and some others, and the narration of the audiobook was good… but this is a slow paced book. I’m sure the intent is purposeful and to mirror Cal’s getting used to this slower pace of life, but as a reader it did struggle to keep my attention. I had to increase the speed, and I know as readers we sometimes naturally skim or read faster through slow parts, so that is a disadvantage of audiobooks. I will say the final third or fourth of the book picked up and I did really enjoy how the author pulled things together. While the ending is satisfactory on its own, knowing is a sequel (or series?), does make me wonder how Cal continues with the information he has learned, but I’m undecided about continuing… I probably will as The Hunter has good reviews. Interested what others thought of this one or next?I’m struggling to rate this book and have settled on 3-1/2. Usually I will round up or down, but this time I feel so strongly on that middle ground that I’m going to leave it unrated. I also use Bookmory because I like their calendar and because they let you assign 1/2 stars, but GR does have so many other good aspects. "

265,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64147945-adi-rocks-socks,Rating 5 out of 5,"5 starsReading The Searcher has left me feeling poignant and introspective, which is definitely not how I thought I’d feel when I started this book – mystery books rarely end on such a note. I’m almost sorry that this book has come to an end, because a part of my mind feels like it still lives in the Irish countryside this book is set in – I’m sometimes watching the rain pour over the fields, clutching a cup of warm tea in my hands; sometimes walking along a dirt path on the mountainside, feeling the crisp breeze play across my face; sometimes coming back from the local pub, slightly drunk, feeling nature press into me as I make my way home.Many reviews of this book compare this novel with Tana French’s Dublin Murder Squad series. I am not qualified to make such an analysis (since I have only just checked out the audio book from the library) – I can only review this book for what it was. As someone who has always meant to read French’s works, my first taste of her writing prowess has only left me hungry for more.The Searcher focuses on Cal Hooper, a Chicago PD retiree and divorcee, who emigrates to a remote village in Ireland after having had enough of his old life. As he settles into his new, slow-paced life, Trey Reddy, a local kid, reaches out to him. His older brother has gone missing, and no one seems interested in finding him. Cal decides to poke around, and finds that this seemingly scenic Irish town has something sinister going on under its surface.Right from the beginning, I was invested in French’s writing. Her vivid descriptions of Irish countryside, with the flocks of sheep, the green but mountainous terrain, the fog that rolled by often, a weather which is moody and changes every half an hour – they all took me back to the vacation I went on with my family last year, where we spent some time at a geographically similar place. I wasn’t home anymore. I was physically there in Ardnakelty village, experiencing everything that Cal Hooper did. In a way, I was reliving my vacation as well. And for me, that highest level of escapism – there is no greater mark of brilliant storytelling than that. To lose complete grasp of what’s going on around you and be wrapped up in those words that you’re reading? That’s excellent writing.While it did take a while for the pace to pick up (about 40% on my Kindle, I’d say), the slowness of the initial chapters managed to instil a sense of foreboding in me as I made my way through Cal’s narration. Once I’d gotten through those slow chapters, I couldn’t stop reading, and even when I did, it was much against my will. (Alas, like most other readers, I need to work to finance my reading habits.) Cal, at times reminded me of Ove from A Man Called Ove, which only endeared his character to me all the more. Cal’s no-nonsense narration set the perfect tone for the mystery. The story had a very Broadchurch-like vibe to it, what with that restless quality which comes from something shady going on in a small town, and it only added to my enjoyment of this novel.One thing I must note is the directness with which French touched upon racism. We always get the sense that Cal didn’t just quit his job and move across an ocean because of his divorce, and the manner in which French included racism, xenophobia and racial profiling in Cal’s backstory mirrored real life in a very tangible way. Coming back to the story – there were plot twists I didn’t see coming. After all, what is a good mystery if there isn’t something that whacks you right in the face in that microsecond that you blink? While some things could be discerned, there were so many other things that I never foresaw, which made it an exciting read. I definitely never anticipated that this book would be interspersed with wry humour, which made me snigger into the cushion I was balancing my Kindle on while I highlighted those paras for future reads. I also definitely never anticipated how wistful the ending would make me feel. The mystery does get resolved satisfactorily, but the way things were written made me wonder about human beings as a species, our ability and inability to be satisfied with our lot in life, the extent to which we’d go to protect what is ours, and made me think along the lines of existential and moral nihilism. If I’m being honest, my mind still ponders those deeper questions, even as I write this review. Just as I feel like I’m permanently stuck in the Irish countryside, I also keep thinking about the human condition.This novel is a very powerful piece of work in many ways, and I truly feel blessed that I had an opportunity to read an ARC. Thank you, Penguin General UK and NetGalley. I never thought a mystery/thriller would leave me feeling the way I am; I absolutely loved this book. -x-Pre-reading:Thank you Penguin General UK for providing me with an ARC! :)"

Poi quando ho visto che de ""Il segugio"" era stato pubblicato l'audiolibro su Audible, mi sono subito affrettata ad audioleggerlo.Il thriller è ambientato in un paese rurale dell'Irlanda occidentale, Ardnakelty. Il protagonista, Cal Hooper, decide di trasferirsi ad Ardnakelty, per ricominciare d'accapo: dopo venticinque anni nella polizia di Chicago, un divorzio alle spalle, una figlia oramai grande, Cal ha bisogno di ritrovarsi e lo fa stando a contatto con l'ambiente rurale e rupestre. “Ironicamente, Mart gli fa spesso la stessa domanda, senza nascondere l’intenzione di voler scoprire i piani a lungo termine di Cal. Ma lui non ha piani precisi. Ora come ora, non riesce a vedere oltre la sistemazione della casa, la pesca del persico e le spiegazioni di Noreen sulla salute dentale di Clodagh Moynihan. Sa che prima o poi arriverà il momento di pensare alla terra. Ma prima di diventare troppo vecchio vuole andare in giro per l’Europa, e tornare quando si sarà tolto la voglia. Non ci sono altri posti dove vorrebbe vivere.”Ma Cal si illude se può archiviare il suo passato da poliziotto, semplicemente cambiato città e Nazione (oltre che continente). A risvegliare il ""segugio"" che è in lui, ci pensa un ragazzino di nome Trey che vuole ad ogni costo ritrovare il fratello, scomparso qualche mese prima. E Trey non è ciò che sembra: ho adorato questo personaggio sin da subito.“Tra i casi che Cal amava meno, sul lavoro, c’erano quelli in cui tentava di seguire una pista che esisteva solo nella mente di qualcuno.”Trey riuscirà a conquistare Cal... “Il fiume oggi è lento, viscoso, muscolare. Le foglie che cadono sulla superficie vengono tirate a fondo senza lasciare traccia. Forse potrebbe dire al ragazzo che Brendan è finito nel fiume, in modo accidentale. Potrebbe inventare una storia convincente, per esempio che stava esplorando il fiume per far partire un’attività di gite di pesca per turisti, o ritiri nella natura per impiegati alla ricerca del loro selvaggio interiore. Sono due cose che quel ragazzo idiota avrebbe dovuto considerare sul serio, tanto per cominciare.Può farcela. Trey si fida di lui, per quanto possa fidarsi di qualcuno.”... e Cal saprà aiutare Trey a giungere alla verità, come la foce di un fiume che raggiunge il mare“I am a poor wayfaring strangerTraveling through this world aloneBut there’s no sickness, toil or dangerIn that bright world to which I go.I’m going there to see my loved onesI’m going there, no more to roamI’m only going over JordanI’m only going over home” [“Sono un povero viandante | Che viaggia solo per il mondo | Ma non c’è malattia, fatica o pericolo | Nel mondo splendente in cui sto andando. | Ci vado per rivedere i miei cari | Ci vado per non vagabondare piú | Sto solo attraversando il Giordano | Sto solo tornando a casa.”]"
271,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/94621065-a-m-potter,Rating 4 out of 5,"Tana French usually writes detective novels set in or near Dublin. Her dialog delivers the magic elixir of story-telling: presence. She can capture the essence of a character with a line or two of craic (conversation). She has the gift of the gab, which puts her dialog up there with Elmore Leonard’s.French’s latest book, The Searcher (2020), is a stand-alone novel featuring retired cop Cal Hooper, a sympatico mid-forties Yank who has washed up in the west of Ireland, looking to leave the mean streets of Chicago behind. Hooper worked Missing Persons in Chicago; as luck would have it, he becomes embroiled in a local misper case.The story unfolds in rural Ireland, sans a slew of high-octane car chases or blood-smeared corpses. However, there’s no lack of drama. If you like stories told with a slow burn, yet plenty of flareups along the way, The Searcher is for you. If you want a policier with forensics and hardened criminals, The Searcher may grab you, but the Dublin Murder Squad novels are likely a better fit."

275,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11488136-lynn-spencer,Rating 4 out of 5,"When I saw that this wasn't a Dublin Murder Squad book, I'll admit I was a tad hesitant. Let's just say The Witch Elm didn't really do it for me. However, I ended up enjoying this book even though I found it unsettling at times.Normally third person, present tense isn't my favorite narration style, but it does fit the story here. The lead character, Cal Hooper, is a retired Chicago police officer. His marriage ended unexpectedly (or at least unexpected by him) and now he is in rural Ireland trying to figure out the rest of his life. Along the way, he stumbles into a mystery and since he is uncovering clues at the same time that he is adjusting to his new home, the immediacy of present tense worked.In Ireland, Cal finds himself settling into a different pace of life and making friends among his neighbors. This is going far better for him than trying to fumble through his relationships with his adult daughter and ex-wife back home. Through his relationships, both in Ireland and back home, we see how being a police officer formed a huge part of Cal's identity. While not obvious to Cal, it's pretty apparent to the reader that at times this part of his identity overshadowed the rest of him. This issue comes up again and again, and at times Cal has to choose whether he's going to be the consummate detective or whether he can tap into a different side of his character, one that can be more accepting of shades of grey in people.I'll be honest. At times Cal frustrated me. In his crime-solving machine mode, he can be somewhat blind to the emotions and needs of the people he encounters,and can come across rather high-handed. In addition, given current events, his internal discussion of living by his ""code"" got my back up a bit. Given the plotline, I caught the homage to old school Western movies, but I'm still not entirely a fan of the ""code."" Still, the book does have some great moments. Cal grows some as a character and the book's ending left me hopeful that he would continue to grow. I also found Trey Reddy to be a great sympathetic character. Much of the book revolves around Cal's efforts to locate Trey's missing brother, and I couldn't help liking Trey. Trey comes from a difficult background and between poverty and local disapproval, their family has the decked stacked against them. However, Trey's determination made the child an interesting character rather than merely a passive victim.As with some of French's books, the answer to the mystery in this novel is rather unsettling, and it made me think, even as I knew I disagreed with some of the characters' moral choices. I miss the first person narratives of the Dublin Murder Squad, but this was a rather interesting read."

What’s bothering him is the fact that Trey was right about one thing: the Guards are, for his purposes anyway, fucking useless. Once O’Malley heard the name Reddy, he was done. So is everyone else. Cal thinks of thos rain-blurred hills, and a mother who’s not up to much. A kid that age shouldn’t be left with nowhere to turn.
Unfortunately I did not like this as much as I’d hoped. Cal used to be a cop in Chicago, but then some things (nothing exciting, don't worry) happened, and now he is living in Ireland, renovating a small house and getting to know his new neighbours. Then one of these neighbours, a twelve year old boy, comes to him and asks him to look for his brother, who’s been missing for a couple of months.Of course Cal doesn’t want to investigate, because he’s not a cop anymore!! goddammit!!, but then he does anyway. Of course.Still, this book isn’t much of a mystery story. I mean, technically it is – at the beginning you wonder what happened to Trey’s brother, and then at the end you find out. But what did happen to him isn’t all that unexpected. It takes almost 200 pages for the realy mystery to begin, and when it finally does, there are no twists and no (real) suprises (especially once you consider that there really aren't all that many suspects to begin with, so the mystery wasn’t that compelling for me. But maybe the characters....Well, I didn’t particularly like Cal, who is, unfortunately, the main character. He’s just the retired-cop-who-can’t-leave-the-job-behind cliché. That’s it. He was married, but is now divorced. He has a child who he doesn't know very well, but wishes he was closer to. He isn’t looking for friends or a new family, but will be forced to find them anyway. He doesn’t want to investigate, but in the end he’ll do it anyway. The rest of the characters are fine – I liked Trey, the bitchy child looking for his brother, and Lena, the neighbour who doesn’t want to get involved (but will definitely get involved), and even Mart, the weird guy who may or may not know more than he’s admitting. They were interesting, but also unfortunately not as important as Cal.At least the writing was just as good as I expected though. I practically felt like I was alone in a slighty run-down house somewhere in rural Ireland, surrounded by some very strange people, a lot of sheep, and even more rain.The book really has a great atmosphere, but it’s a little wasted on its boring main character and the not-so-great mystery story."

His marriage has collapsed apparently because his wife no longer wants to be the wife of a cop (after more than twenty happy years) and because of an incident where the pursuit of a black suspect, who wasn’t hurt in any way, sickened him against his job. This is Chicago, where the death rate is high and cops have thick skins. He also has a moody daughter, although it’s never explained why.So far so Quiet Man. If only. A sulky thirteen year old kid starts hanging round his house and, for some reason, the cop entices the kid onto his lawn and starts teaching him woodwork on an old desk. He also teaches the kid to kill rabbits. After some time, the kid reveals that his older brother is missing and he wants the cop to find him so, after an initial refusal, the cop agrees, mainly because the kid throws eggs at his house.Pause.We are now halfway through this long book (over 400 pages) and we’re still waiting for the thriller we were promised. There are lots of descriptions of the Irish countryside, how to renovate an old desk, debating over whether to adopt a pub and an abundance of whimsy and Oirishisms from his neighbour and from the local matchmaking shopkeeper.After a lot more of nothing much happening, the cop finds out that the kid is, in fact, a girl so he tells her he can’t go on with the ‘investigation’ and that she can’t come back to work on the desk any more.Until she turns up at his door one night, having been brutally beaten. SPOILER STARTS HERE.It transpires that her feckless mother – abandoned by her husband, six kids – did it. Not because she meant the girl any harm but because the people responsible for the brother’s disappearance wanted the ‘investigation’ to stop. Instead of warning off the cop, they told the mother to beat the girl to a pulp or they would. So she did.No. Just no. This downtrodden woman, who wouldn’t say boo to a goose, half kills her own child on the say so of the local bullies and doesn’t even come looking for her when she stays at the cop’s house. Not only that, but the cop feels sympathetic towards the mother.SPOILER ENDSThe end, when it comes, is unrealistic, a damp squib that, quite frankly left me incredulous.In departing from her usual Dublin-based Murder Squad, I’m afraid Ms French has lost the plot, both figuratively and literally."
278,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21076478-buchdoktor,Rating 5 out of 5,"Cal Hooper hat sich noch in seinen besten Jahren in Chicago als Polizist pensionieren lassen und ein renovierungsbedürftiges Haus in Irland gekauft. Aus seinem früheren Leben gibt es in den USA Frau und Tochter und Cal wirkt noch etwas anfängerhaft in Hausarbeit, die keine Handwerkerarbeit ist. Nicht erst, als Trey, ein junger Typ im Hoodie, bei Cal auftaucht, fühlt er sich beobachtet, obwohl er keine direkten Nachbarn hat. „Hoodie“ schwänzt vermutlich die Schule, wirkt vernachlässigt, und will gehört haben, Cal wäre Cop. Dass unter den wachsamen Augen eines irischen Dorfes ein allein lebender Mann keine Freundschaft zu einem schulpflichtigen Jugendlichen pflegen kann, ist Cal von Anfang an klar. Und doch wäre es schade, wenn jemand handwerklich so geschicktes wie Trey als Schulschwänzer auf die schiefe Bahn geraten würde. Cals Tochter Alyssa sieht aus der Ferne sofort den wunden Punkt in der Beziehung ihres Vaters zu Trey: Falls du je wieder in die USA zurückkommen willst, sag dem Typen das bitte gleich und lass ihn nicht im Stich! Als bei Nachbar Mart ein Schaf getötet wird und als Trey auspackt, sein Bruder Brendan würde schon länger vermisst, klinkt Cals Ermittler-Instinkt ein. Er steckt in der Beziehung zu Trey und dessen Familie inzwischen so tief, dass er keine Wahl hat, als die Spur eines Jungen aufzunehmen, der sich für einen gerissenen Geschäftsmann hielt. Cal sucht freundschaftlichen Kontakt zum Ortspolizisten, kauft sich die Waffe, von der er schon immer träumte – und muss feststellen, dass er wie im Märchen vom Hasen und dem Igel offenbar stets mit hängender Zunge zu spät kommt. „Dies ist kein sanfter Ort“ sagt Cals Nachbar Mart, den der US-Cop wie so einige andere Personen auch völlig falsch eingeschätzt hat. Mich hat Cal allein deshalb fasziniert, weil ich ihm lange nicht abnehmen konnte, dass ein US-Cop völlig ohne familiäre oder berufliche Verbindungen neu nach Irland kommt. Irgendetwas musste doch auch Cal zu verbergen haben. In seinem unerwartet harschen Setting in der Nähe der Grenze zwischen Nordirland und der Republik Irland funktioniert „Der Sucher“ als psychologisches Portrait zweier Einzelgänger ebenso gut wie als Ermittler-Krimi, bei dem Cal schon mal gegnerische Geschosse um die Ohren pfeifen. Tana French hatte ich noch immer mit Dublin Murder Squad auf dem Schirm; mit ihrem „Neuen“ konnte sie mich positiv überraschen."

It perhaps doesn’t have quite the depth of some of Tana French’s finest books, but it’s still very good indeed.It is the story of Cal, a retired, divorced, disillusioned Chicago cop who buys a derelict house near a small village in the West of Ireland to have some peace of mind. He begins to form a relationship with Trey, a local 13-year-old whose brother has disappeared; Cal reluctantly agrees to look into it and complexities and dark undercurrents begin to emerge.Like all of Tana French’s books, this is a novel of place and character, driven by a suspenseful crime story. The story itself here is slow and measured in pace – which I liked very much. It fits in well with the pace of life of the community and the careful, steady work which Cal outs in on his house and which he begins to teach to Trey. I see some reviewers found this tedious, but I liked it very much, along with the excellent depiction of the life and characters of a small rural community. The characterisation and dialogue are, as always, brilliant. French also has important things to say about masculinity, fatherhood, moral behaviour and other things. There was enough tension to keep me hooked and the whole thing was a pleasure for me.This may not be one of Tana French’s very best but it’s still extremely good and I can recommend it very warmly.(My thanks to Penguin Books for an ARC via NetGalley.)"

Those searching for a tense mystery might be disappointed in The Searcher, because here French gives us a mystery, sure, in the guise of a missing teenage boy, but that seems to take a back seat to the atmospheric Irish countryside. I adored this book, possibly because I read it in the weeks leading up to the 2020 Presidential election, when I desperately needed to escape, and Ireland seemed appealing. Nobody writes about Ireland better than French, who actually grew up in Vermont, and I adored her descriptions of the village and the interactions between ex-cop Cal Hooper and Trey Reddy, the local kid who is desperate for help finding the missing boy. I am awestruck by French's ability to make the landscape such an integral part of the story that Ireland itself is a character, with passages like these: “The windshield mottles with big splatters too fast for the wipers to keep up, and his tires send fans of muddy water spraying from potholes. The smell of the fields comes through the cracked car window, fresh with wet grass and fertile with cow dung. The mountains are invisible; beyond the fields there's only gray, cloud blending into mist. The herd animals stand still, huddled together, with their heads down.” "

So this is described as a mystery thriller but it’s so much more than that I fell in love with the whole concept of the story from beginning to end. Set in a small town Ireland retired detective Cal Hooper has moved from Chicago and bought a run down cottage to renovate and also to escape from his past. Being an outsider it’s hard for Cal to fit in but with his easy nature he does and what a magnificent set of characters we meet as Cal little by little is accepted and makes friends. This is a read that’s hard to describe as at its heart there is a mystery but for me it was about so many other things I loved the slow pace of the book as the story progressed I felt involved in what was happening and I cared so much about these characters especially Cal and Trey.  A wonderful and beautifully written novel and one that I shall miss, a book that took my breath away and took to another place and it’s certainly one I won’t forget.Many many thanks to Tana French for giving me so much pleasure in reading this.My thanks also to NetGalley and Penguin UK, Viking for giving me the chance to read the ARC in exchange for my honest opinion."

I enjoyed it mainly due to the social awareness of the main character, Cal. He had a sixth sense about the locals and their attempts to manipulate him. The delicate way he handled his investigation, always aware of the implication of his actions, was refreshing and multi-faceted. He's also got a good heart with the well-being of young Trey Reddy at the forefront of his work on the case to find the missing brother.If you're expecting an action packed story, this one won't deliver. It moves slowly with a lot of reflection and backstory as well as long passages with Cal puzzling out what may have happened to Trey's brother. There are many stops and starts, with quirky interactions and a brooding setting to add to the dark mood.Quote: ""Their decades of familiarity, which seemed like a comfort at the beginning..., weave themselves into an impenetrable thicket..."""
283,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"I was surprised to hear an American voice narrating--this is what happens when you reserve titles based on the author and you don't read reviews or comments. Or at least you don't remember what you did read. All worked out for me--and for the characters in this fish-out-of-water tale of an ex-Chicago policeman who moves to a small Western Ireland town to find peace and instead becomes involved in sorting out the town's dirty secrets. Not as much of a mystery as her Dublin Murder Squad, but I liked it better than her previous standalone, The Witch Elm (perhaps because that was her first standalone and I was expecting another Dublin procedural). Wonderful sense of place, lots of atmosphere with a dark and moody tone, fully developed characters (Cal is particularly interesting and introspective), and a wonderfully tender relationship between Cal and young Trey, who just wants Cal to find a missing brother. Doesn't hurt that I'm also a Westerns fan and can relate to Cal as a kind of Western hero. Not the Tana French book to start with but one not to miss. "

Well for starters there is way too much jargon, i feel the writer has simply added unnecessary information just to lengthen the book. it was very difficult to continue reading after the first page. it is a very slow book but i think the writer was trying to build a world and give backstories to characters its just they were unnecessary. her characters were cliche and did not need depth.this book would honestly well be better if called a screenplay rather than a novel. trey and cal had good enjoyable camaraderie.the book is exciting in the last 150 pages. except for one or two twists everything is too predictable.i am extremely conflicted about this book and its rating."

Das Zwischenmenschliche, die Beschreibungen von Land und Leuten, von Tätigkeiten - all das ist wirklich toll ausgeführt und nimmt mich als Leser sofort mit auf eine Gedankenreise.Aber die eigentliche Handlung des Romans, das Spannungselememt, konnte mich diesmal nicht wirklich überzeugen. Der Anfang - das Kind, das den Bruder vermisst und wissen will, was aus ihm geworden ist, dieser Teil des Handlungsstrangs war wie gewohnt mitreißend. Aber schon die ""Ermittlungen "" und die dünne Geschichte, die darum gesponnen wird, fand ich sehr hanebüchern. Und das große Geheimnis, die Auflösung, konnte mich nicht überzeugen. Daher dann insgesamt doch nur 3 Sterne."

I have read all of her previous seven books and appreciate how she has branched out in each one.A former Chicago cop, after a divorce and deep disillusionment with law enforcement, has moved to Ireland. While fixing up his cottage and getting to know the local people and customs in his remote village, he gets pulled into a missing person case by a curious child who shows up on his property.Though the story takes a while to get going, Tana French builds tension on every page until all the clues come together.

Cal's accent and wording are a parody of a Chicago cop who apparently spent time with his ""granddaddy"" in the backwoods of North Carolina. And Mart sounds like some kind of leprechaun, the very kind that he and his friends make fun of. The problem is that French clearly loves writing dialogue, but it just goes on forever, rarely advancing the story in any meaningful way. I loved her first two novels a lot. They were spooky and strange and well plotted. It's been downhill, way downhill, ever since. After Broken Harbor, probably the worst of the lot, I vowed I wouldn't go back, but then people told me this one was really good. LIES, all LIES. I'm done."

Not sure what the critic quoted in the blurb is on about, but this is nothing like a ""compulsive psychological mystery.""

(Like I could picture it in my head as a movie I've seen before.) The Irish town that Cal moves into was filled with unlikeable characters. He mistakes Trey for what they really are and that threw me off a little. I did like that character but it wasn't enough for me to get invested into their life. The ""solving"" of Brendan's disappearance wasn't really actiony either. The story ended with me wanting more. My husband listened to this one and he liked it so maybe it's more for a male audience?"

293,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/72724355-alli,Rating 4 out of 5,A slow mystery set in Ireland that is a true character driven story. I liked all of the characters as their motivations made sense to me even if I didn’t agree with their behavior. I think that is difficult in writing - to convey why someone behaves badly but have the reader understand that’s the only natural thing that could have happened. I thought the writing was done well and the slow unfold wasn’t too slow. This wasn’t set up as a thriller so we didn’t need the fast pace. I went into this one blind without knowing about the author or much about the premise and glad I took a chance. A good solid story that was enjoyable.

While I wouldn’t say this one falls anywhere near my favorite by her, I did enjoy it. There are so many dimensions to the way the story was written: from the atmospheric elements, to the relationships that are being built, and what the main character has left behind/still struggles with. It’s good book, I just wish there had been a little less time spent on building the narrative and a little more psychological struggle like in French’s other books. Four stars though. "

This book may be my least favorite of Tana's so far, but its biggest fault doesn't really lie with Tana. Despite her standing as a mystery writer, I don't think this book should have been marketed as a true mystery. There is a lot more subtlety at play here than even her most subtle books, and I think her true intention was to focus on the interplay between these characters with the ""mystery"" as a supporting plotline.

The autumn sun gave the greens of the fields an impossible, mythic radiance and transformed the back roads into light-muddled paths where a goblin with a fiddle, or a pretty maiden with a basket, could be waiting around every game and-bramble bend. Cal is in no mood to appreciate any of it.”Tana French is such an exquisite writer, with a gorgeous turn of phrase and a sensibility and imagination where the fae and the other and the gothic seem to be breathing heavily in the background and The Searcher is no exception.In The Searcher – which is not one of her Dublin Murder Squad series – we focus on Cal, a Chicago cop retiring to rural Ireland after a difficult divorce. Cal is a fascinating character: he is capable of violence but bound by an iron self control, disillusioned and cynical yet also romantic, aching for his family which is on the other side of the Atlantic and grasping hard on the opportunity to fill that void.The novel opens as a paean to Ireland and landscape and the countryside and abounds with sentences like thisLandscape is one of the few things he knows of where the reality doesn’t let you down. The West of Ireland looked beautiful on the internet; from right smack in the middle of it, it looks even better. The air is rich as fruitcake, like you should do more with it than just breathe it…and thisThe mountains on the horizon look like someone took a pocketknife and sliced neat curves out of the star-thick sky, leaving empty blackness. Here and there, spread out, are the yellow rectangles of windows, tiny and valiant.The people around him and in the village of Ardnakelty are more of a problem for Cal: his busybody of a neighbour Mart; the group of locals who drink in the local pub, Seán Óg’s; Noreen who runs the only local shop and is desperate to matchmake between Cal and Lena, her widowed sister; the impenetrable network of family, cousins, marriages, friendships and alliances within the little village community and farms; and of course the Reddy family living in the mountains, a single mum and her six kids, one of whom, Trey, starts to sneak around Cal’s ruin of a house.Trey has learnt that Cal was a cop and Trey’s brother has disappeared, which drags Cal into a complex family dynamic and unearths secrets and dangers within the community into which he has found himself. Tensions are discovered, subtle undercurrents of threat and menace which resolve into real violence.I’ll be cautious about giving too many details, for fear of spoiling the novel because the plot does carry its fair share of twists, but there was a sub plot: sheep on some of the farms were being attacked and slaughtered and butchered, one farm after another, with wild theories raised about aliens and animals“Come here,” he says, shifting his bulk around on the bar stool to face Cal. “Listen to this. Night before last, something kilt one of Bobby’s sheep. Took out its throat, its tongue, its eyes and its arse; left the rest.”“Sliced out,” Bobby says.Senan ignores this. “What would you say done it, hah?”“If I was a gambling man,” Cal says, “my money’d be on an animal.”“What animal?” Bobby demands. “We’ve no coyotes or mountain lions here. A fox won’t touch a grown ewe. A rogue dog would’ve ripped her to bits.”I loved this side to the novel! Beasts stalking the ancient landscape is so deliciously Tana French! It took me back to the first Dublin Murder Squad series novel, In The Woods, in which the woods were or may have been haunted by a goat-smelling presence, or perhaps the muscular darkness lurking in the attic of Broken Harbour. And it was wonderful seeing Cal seduced by the possibility of something other as an explanation for these mutilations in his neighbours’ fields. I am a sucker for those urban or rural folkloric tales of big cats and the beasts of Bodmin Moor, the Roy Dog… tales that could resolve in mundane explanations (escaped pets) or something more supernatural.The novel is not, however, plot driven: the plot is present but, detached from any pressure of the institution of the police procedural, is pursued languidly and leisurely – and the renovations in Cal’s dilapidated house, his and Trey’s work on the damaged desk together, the rooks and rabbits and fishing all take up as much of the word count as the search for the truth behind Trey’s brother’s disappearance.What is at the heart of this novel are the characters and their relationships: Cal’s pseudo-surrogate father figure relationship with Trey is wonderful and difficult; his friendship with Lena grows into something positive and supportive and unsentimental as the rocks beneath the landscape; his friendship with Mart. Ardnakelty itself, the village and its community, is so vividly realised that it becomes a character in its own right.The denouement and resolution of the novel is also wonderfully French: unlike many crime fiction writers, French’s resolutions are rarely simple or comforting. Truth and right and justice are complex terms and far from synonymous is French’s novels – and the resolution of this one follows the same pattern. It is credibly lacking in neatness or simplicity: the resolution is complex, nuanced and difficult and I have loved that about most of her novels.On a few occasions, the novel does strain credibility a touch: Cal’s ability to get people to discuss difficult and personal histories without the support and authority of a badge, and particularly as an outsider within a close-knit community, did rankle a little bit in places – it’s hard to see why these people did not resort to close lipped sullenness or a terse “Feck you” more often! But these were mere moments and outweighed by far by the luminous and beautiful prose as French slides from colloquial slang to lyrical description, from humour to horror, with ease.This is the sort of quietly distutbing novel that remains with you for longer than you expect after reading it."

So he moved to a village in the West of Ireland, ""no bigger than the little end of nothing,"" where people leave their doors unlocked. After three months, his new life ends when he's sought out by Trey Reddy who has learned of Hooper's former profession. Trey fears something bad has happened to his 19 -year-old brother, Brendan, who hasn't been seen in about six months. Because their mother, Sheila, is convinced Brendan took off on his own, Trey hasn't gone to the police. Despite Hooper's cynicism, he agrees to look into the case, starting with Sheila.The more Hooper digs, the more he finds that his new community hides dark secrets. Insightful characterizations, even of minor figures, and a devasting reveal help make this an awesome book and outcome. Folks that like a good fiction story won't want to miss this one. I find it very understanding that she if not most of the authors are having a hard time with creating suspense and not have difficulties in their own personal lives.But for the last few months, French has been struggling to write. She’s too anxious about the state of the world.“I’ve realized how much of this gig is your subconscious, and my subconscious, like everybody else’s in the world, is a smoking crater right now,” she said during a video interview from her home in Dublin, where she has been in varying degrees of lockdown with her husband and two daughters. “It’s all used up by dealing with what’s going on around us and trying to process it.”Great book, Highly Recommend!!!"

It's been sitting on my shelf, staring at me, since the first month it was published. I always buy Tana French novels as soon as they're published.But, then, I might take my own sweet time reading them. As much as I love French's books, I know that she writes books that make me deeply uncomfortable. Bad things happen in these books. Characters get hurt. The pain is so well written that it feels real in a way that few writers have been able to master (in my experience, at least). As I said, when a new French novel comes out, I buy it right away. But sometimes I wait to read it until I'm emotionally grounded enough to handle the book.When it was released, I watched a Zoom-based conversation between French and Marlon James. If I recall correctly, it was hosted by Politics and Prose, a bookstore in Washington D.C. During the interview, French explained that this novel is a Western. (Clearly, the title alluding to the John Wayne film and the cover image of wind-tossed wheat should help readers recognize that instantly.) Yes, this book is set in Ireland, like her other novels. However, unlike her other novels, it's set on the Western side of Ireland, in a small farming community. French explained that ""the West"" (no matter the country) is often considered an uncivilized, lawless sort of place. Our story, then, is a Western story about a retired cop, new in town, looking for a quiet place to settle down and recover from his past. Clearly, that's not what he gets.Both this novel and The Witch Elm, French's last novel before this one, are far different from her Dublin Murder Squad books. They're still mysteries. Cal is a retired policeman, which would seem to mean that he would have something in common with the detectives of the Murder Squad. But these two novels feel more experimental, as French is exploring different characters and motivations. French always surprises, and these two books have been even more surprising than her other works.I can't wait to read her next book--but I probably will."

Ну честное слово, Тана Френч, ты не Пруст и даже не Валентин Распутин! А если хочется быть одним или другим, то зачем это продавать под маркой детектива?

И загуторила ирландская глубинка, закалякала да забалакала (тьху). Заодно переводчица заботливо русифицировала названия музыкальных групп, песен и мультперсонажей. А то откуда же русскоязычному читателю знать, кто такие миньоны?

And it is different from her Dublin Murder Squad series.It is super slow slow slowburn. I was visibly bored by 15% of the book and wondered if I should stick with it. It picks up in Chapter 8. So yes, you have to read about Cal Hooper leading a retired life, drinking with his buddies, building chairs and tables, trying to repair his house—basically the laid back retired life. Now here is why it is clever—American in Ireland; hence unfamiliar territory to solve a mystery; retired cop so he can only ask around, not verify statements or get backup force or even have friends to ask for favours. I loved the relationship between Cal and Trey, the kid whose brother is missing (the mystery that Cal has to solve). I enjoyed how the investigation progressed. It was like jumping into the dark. You go forward by intuition only. Another positive about the book is how the atmosphere builds up—I felt damp, wet, walking through Ireland. There's some shooting of animals, gossip sessions and small town talk, all of which enhance the rural life. As is usual with Tana French, there's a mystery at the forefront and the personal problems of the main character at the background. This is the same. I didn't feel a big connection to Cal, but I was happy the way he and Trey got along. There's forgiveness, redemption and all the flaws that make us human. Note, The Searcher is in third person. If you aren't a very patient reader, the slowness might irk you though.Rating : 3.5/5 Much thanks to Viking for an e- copy of the book.

307,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2116192-madprofessah,Rating 5 out of 5,"Tana French is on my short list of must-buy authors. These are the authors who when you hear they have a new book coming out you think, “I must buy that!” It is a rather short list: French, Peter F. Hamilton, James S.A. Corey and Richard K. Morgan. My must-read list of authors is much longer. The reason why Tana French is one of the authors that I am willing to put down my hard-earned cash to pre-order their latest book is because she always produces reading experiences for me that are engrossing, exciting and extraordinary. All of this is to say, I’m very happy to have a new Tana French novel to read and review. You’re in for a treat!In her new book, The Searcher, French again eschews producing an entry in her Dublin Murder Squad series; instead she has written what is presumably a stand-alone mystery novel with a new protagonist in a new setting. In fact, she’s moved even further away from the series that brought her fame, fans and fortune in The Searcher than she did in The Witch Elm, which at least was set in Dublin, even though that book didn’t contain any characters from earlier novels, which had been French’s signature story element prior to its publication in 2018. The Searcher, however, is set in a tiny fictional Irish village (named Ardnakelty) and the main character is not Irish but American: Cal Hooper, an ex-Chicago P.D. detective who, following a bewildering divorce and sudden retirement, has bought a pile of land and decrepit fixer-upper in the middle of nowhere Ireland.Just like The Witch Elm was very different from any of French’s previously published books (by not using a previously introduced secondary character as the primary character in a subsequent book) so is The Searcher different from all her previous books. One of the constitutive elements of her stories has been a view of the interplay between the police protagonist and their fellow detectives as well as between the protagonist and their profession. Plus all of French’s previous books were set in Dublin or its suburbs, with urbanized living as a feature of her characters’ lives. In French’s new book she throws out all these familiar aspects of her previous work and strikes out in a new, unfamiliar direction. It’s a brave (and rewarding) move.The Searcher is set in a remote, rural village that has at its core a pub cum general store and one gas station and a police station with one cop. Most of the inhabitants earn their meager living from the land as farmers. Ardnakelty is the kind of place where all the kids who graduate from school are expected to leave for better opportunities elsewhere, with only the unsuccessful trapped behind, with only distant (or not so distant) relatives. Cal has moved here precisely because it is remote and sparsely populated. He was also interested in Western Ireland when he was looking for places to retire to on the Internet because the weather doesn’t get too cold or too hot. French is clearly enamored by such places, and her typically lyrical prose waxes poetic as she describes the weather, landscape and scenery.The book starts with Cal making friends with a local tween boy named Trey Reddy who has learned that the new American neighbor is some kind of cop and wants him to find out what happened to his older brother Brendan, 19. Trey last saw his brother nearly six months ago when Brendan left their house in a hurry with a backpack and a worried expression. Cal really doesn’t want to take the case, because as a cop he is pretty sure what a 6-month-old missing persons case means (Brendan’s dead, right? Or run away to the big city to seek his fortune). He’s also unfamiliar with the terrain (literally) and because he’s new to the area, he doesn’t know where the bodies are buried or what the criminal undercurrents in the village are. Cal’s neighbor Mart has generally been his guide to acclimating to life in Ardnakelty but he is definitely not in favor of Cal sticking his nose where it doesn’t belong. He doesn’t even want Cal to look into what or who is going around killing local farmer’s sheep in strange and disgusting ways. Are these cases related? As an experienced reader, I was pretty sure they are.As others have noticed, basically, what French is doing in The Searcher is that she is writing a Western disguised as a mystery novel! Cal is the taciturn stranger new to town who is convinced to try to resolve an injustice that the townspeople have been living with for a longtime. And the current powerbrokers don’t react well to the newcomer trying to disrupt the status quo. It’s a brilliant move, and puts a fresh twist on a familiar tale. As the plot unwinds, French slowly ratchets up the tension higher and higher, while simultaneously revealing secrets about the quiet, remote village and its inhabitants who shows themselves to be as potentially dangerous as those in Cal’s old stomping grounds on the South Side of Chicago.Overall, I though The Searcher was very good, but not as good as French’s two previous books, The Witch Elm and The Trespasser, which I think are two of her very best. Of course, French at her very best means these are some of the best mystery novels in the entire genre. Even merely sublime Tana French is extremely satisfying, and The Searcher is one of the best books I read all year. (I still hope that her next book is Dublin Murder Squad mystery, or perhaps follows one of the minor characters from h The Searcher or h The Witch Elm !"
308,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5120324-leeanna-weaver,Rating 4 out of 5,"I have enjoyed French’s Dublin Murder Squad and was excited to read her stand-alone novel, The Searcher. Unlike plot-driven mysteries, The Searcher is a deep dive into characters. The protagonist, Cal, is a mysterious stranger who has taken residence in a tiny village on the western coast of Ireland. His skill as a former Chicago detective, specializing in missing persons, is put to use when a young villager enlists his help to locate a missing brother. French creates a vivid picture of the western coast of Ireland. Its unpredictable and rugged beauty is as much a character as Cal. The story is a slow burn with most of the action happening in the last third of the novel. The Searcher is an interesting departure for the author - more a western than a mystery. Maybe she will continue to test the limits of her storytelling."
309,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/90802873-dylan-kakoulli,Rating 3 out of 5,"I’ve been really craving crime recently (not entirely sure what that says about me lol), and one notable, contemporary author whom I’ve constantly been told would fit such an odd bill (and who’s actually been on my list for quite a while now too) is Tana French.Now, you might be wondering (with this author in mind) why the heck didn’t I then kick things off with her highly acclaimed -supposedly “unputdownable” Dublin Murder Squad series?And to you fellow dear readers, I admit, you may have a point.However, what with my recent reading (and recommended) experience when it comes to; expectations vs (or meeting) reality, I thought it best to try and start things off on a more “even” playing field.And, without tooting my own trumpet? Blowing my own horn ? (Not sure which analogy works best -same thing though I guess) this worked out pretty well indeed. So much so, that I’ve already ordered the first DMS instalment to tuck into next!Anyway enough waffle, and onto the review…The searcher -much like I assume the rest of French’s work, is just a cut above your average, contemporary crime novel.It’s an atmospheric (albeit slightly too bogged down in unnecessary detail at times), slow burner of a “thriller” -or mystery as we have here. Where the actual “crime” or ominous event, is almost on the back burner, to what is otherwise a more character driven -perhaps morally motivated, study into human nature; grief, sacrifices, relationships -both to land and people.It is an unassuming and ambiguous tale, that’ll draw you “in” to its story, though perhaps not for the reasons you’d expect, when starting out (gosh what a convoluted sentence. I just don’t want to give too much away!)Put it this way, if you’re looking for a suspenseful, sharp, action packed speed chase of a read, then this might not be for you. Though, if like me, you don’t mind a meandering (though measured) mystery into the moody pastoral landscapes of a modern day Ireland. Where the central motivation -or driving force, is less focused on revenge -or even “answers”to said mystery, and is instead, more concerned in the aftermath and subsequent affects on those left behind, then I say, give this one a go!3/3.5 stars"
310,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13244359-donna,Rating 3 out of 5,"I like this author and her writing. What I like the most are her descriptive strokes and her character development. She can also weave a curious story. All of those things were present here. Having an American (a retired cop from Chicago) living in Ireland was a fun twist for this novel. He was a likable character. The friends he makes in Ireland were also well constructed. Now at times this felt a little slow for my liking, but still an enjoyable read. So 3 stars."
311,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3092660-michael-mullady,Rating 4 out of 5,Tana knows how to set a table perfectly without making it seem too plain. Great emotion and character interaction in every chapter. Even though you may figure out what is happening you want to keep reading because the location and the writing is so good! Plus the small twists that make the whole story worth it. Definitely not disappointed and I mean who doesn’t love any book set in Ireland!
312,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34382391-alice-kwok,Rating 5 out of 5,"Put down whatever you are doing and read this book now. It is the best work yet from one of the most innovative living mystery writers. There is a lot of classic Tana French material here: melancholy reflections on the socio-economic problems of modern Ireland; minor-key musings on the double-edged intimacy of small communities; gruff, troubled heroes struggling to do the right thing and arriving at a more complicated understanding of morality than they began with. However, there is also a lot here that is new for the author. Principally, the landscape of rural Ireland becomes a major character in its own right. While her previous books have been set in a resolutely gritty, bustling Dublin, The Searcher lingers at length over the beauty of the Irish countryside. Also, her protagonist is a retired Chicago cop, not one of the Dublin Murder Squad. Finally - and I appreciated this, though I understand some may not - French drops her tendency towards obscurantist magical realism. By sticking with her strongest suits and introducing some fresh evolutions, she has produced a truly superb novel. Would recommend to anyone."
313,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24249633-jennifer,Rating 4 out of 5,This one was interesting. May be more of a 3.75 star but I’m rounding up and feeling generous. It wasn’t shocking or intense. It was kind of a slow boil. But I never got bored or wanted to stop listening so to me that’s a sign of a good book. I liked Cal and his fish out of water experiences. I always thought what it would be like to live in another country and I assumed it would be a little scary and uncomfortable for all the reasons Cal was feeling. Not knowing the lay of the land and wondering if he might cause offense without even knowing why. I think the characters were what made this book. I enjoyed them. All in all a good book to make my 100 book goal a realization for 2020!!
314,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2069203-reading-is-my-hustle,Rating 4 out of 5,"i like that tana french chose to have her main character be an american living in a small town in ireland. it's her first protagonist that isn’t irish & since her novels are character based it’s made for a more nuanced read. her choice to write in third person keeps us more distanced from the characters but the omnipresent, malevolent atmosphere in this one is tops.      "
315,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55675518-christine,Rating 5 out of 5,"What is it about Tana French?Stories with a lot of description - I can't stand them. Scan them and get on with the good stuff. Who needs atmosphere, right? Yet the bogs, the rain, the desk, the house and a million small details slowly wind you in without detracting ( or distracting) you from the search and the searchers. Take your time to enjoy this read. just s notion- wouldn't this make a nice screenplay? Imagine the cinematography!"
316,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10764362-brightness,Rating 3 out of 5,"Slow moving but ultimately satisfying. Virtually no thriller/suspense aspect but the characters are well drawn and Cal as the expat American retired cop living in a small Irish village was an interesting character to follow though not as much perhaps as his Irish neighbors. If Netflix made an adaptation, I would watch."

320,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22026875-cheryl,Rating 4 out of 5,"Character-centric mystery featuring a retired Chicago cop who has moved to a remote Irish village to live. The descriptions of the Irish scenery and the characters who live in this village were excellent and is what pulled me into this story. The people felt real and I felt like I was right there with Cal (the main character). It's not a fast moving thriller, but a slowly revealing mystery about a missing person Cal is asked to find. Add in the moral decisions Cal is facing during his investigation and the book feels a bit closer to literary fiction than the mystery genre. It's a different style of mystery than others written by this author, but I found it to be a very satisfying one."
321,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70925457-frederick-reed,Rating 4 out of 5,Tana French is a very good story teller and I would highly recommend this book to fans of well written fiction.
322,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2707400-gail,Rating 4 out of 5,I love all of Tana French’s books. This is a great addition. 
323,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2013209-janet,Rating 3 out of 5,"Expertly narrated by Roger Clark, this newest Tana French is not her best in my opinion. The tropes are a little too cliche'.....retired cop with a heart of gold sets out to help a ragamuffin youngster find his brother who was mixed up with some bad people. Not many surprises and the twists that do exist are not particularly revelatory. I guess I've come to expect better from French. If you do read this, I recommend the audio as there is some singing near the end and Clark has a marvelous voice."

325,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2133111-jacqie,Rating 4 out of 5,"Thanks to Netgalley for providing a copy of this book for review.I hadn't heard anything about this book before starting it, but now I'm seeing reviewers say that it's French's take on a western. I'll go a bit further. It's Winter's Bone but set in Ireland and if Ree Dolly had procured the help of a retired cop. So, there isn't a ton of plot. Cal Hooper is asked by a kid from the ""trashy"" family up the mountain to find what happened to the oldest brother in the family. The brother has gone missing and it seems likely that things did not end well for him. Cal, a retired cop from Chicago, somehow has to get people in an insular Irish village to give him information, and he doesn't have great success. He also avoids an obvious source of information that would have greatly changed the outcome of the story.As a mystery, it's okay. As a book, I rated it highly because of the sense of place and atmosphere. It's a rural noir story, and Cal sometimes really enjoys living in his isolated cottage but sometimes it's pretty spooky. The villagers are sometimes friendly and sometimes it seems that Cal will never truly know these people, who show the only parts of themselves that an outsider is fit to see. There's history in this village that Cal can't understand, and the relationship undercurrents that go along with that. I liked Cal and I was interested in his mission. All of the characters were well drawn, but that's no surprise in a book by this author. I'd rate this as one of her better books."

I cannot lie , Tana writing style is so beautiful and nice but for me there’s some part are too lengthy and it sometimes turn me off. 🙏🏻 . This book is a slow burn pace kind of book.

I’m glad towards the end , there’s a plot twist happens which make me can’t wait for the ending. The most great part that excites me when Cal explained about manners , etiquette and morals. 👍🏻 .

I don't want to spoil anything so I will just say that The Searcher was an excellent plot, interesting characters, and a good ending. The only part that left me a little incredulous was the way Cal, the main character, questioned people. No longer a cop, it struck me as a little odd that people would put up with so much interrogation and not just refuse to answer him. "
328,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31185245-tom-s,Rating 4 out of 5,Tana French is one of my favorites. This one is different from the Dublin murder squad books. A retired cop moves to Ireland.
329,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30261451-celia,Rating 4 out of 5,"Both listened to and read The Searcher by Tana French.Summary (obtained from supersummary.com):The Searcher (2020) is a novel by Irish American author Tana French, who has made a name for herself penning literary fiction with the plot and pacing of a crime novel. This novel described as Tana French’s Irish Western features a retired policeman and a missing boy.The protagonist, Cal, is an American ex-cop who retires in the West of Ireland and spends ample time refurbishing his home before fate has other plans for him. French’s novel has a “western tinge” in being inspired by the American western trope of an outsider coming into a community and changing everything around them. Forty-eight-year-old Cal Hooper moves to the rural West of Ireland from Chicago to undertake early retirement and leave his past behind. Following his divorce, his estrangement from his daughter Alyssa and his disenchantment with his job as a police officer, Cal decides to seek out an existence of fishing, rabbit hunting and home refurbishment in the rural village of Ardnakelty. The close-knit community of locals treat him as a curiosity and attempt to include him by inviting him to the local pub or, in the case of the convenience store owner Noreen, attempting to set him up with her widowed sister Lena.At first, when Cal realizes that he is being watched, he tries to ignore the matter. However, his spy turns out to be the determined 13-year-old Trey Reddy. Despite Cal’s wish to conceal the knowledge, Trey is aware that Cal was a former cop, and he wants him to help find his brother Brendan, who disappeared six months earlier. He acquiesces and the plot continues as Cal interviews locals to determine Brendan Reddy's fate.The CharactersCal Hooper - 48 year old ex-cop from ChicagoTrey Reddy - 13 year old brother of the missing elder brother, Brendan Reddy Brendan Reddy - the reader does not 'meet' him, but the memory of him looms large in the communitySheila Reddy - their motherMart Lavin - Cal's neighbor who portrays himself as the bumbling busybodyMy ImpressionsSlow paced. We learn a lot about how Cal thinks when he shares his thoughts with us and shares them with Trey. The most impressive of these is Cal's idea of good and evil. He describes himself as 'having a code' and he sees Trey that way too.The voice of Roger Clark as audio narrator adds another dimension to Cal. Clark's voice is unique and assists in the listener/reader's ability to really visualize Cal.I am not usually a crime story reader, but the easy accessibility of the audio book so that I could listen as I drive, convinced me to try this novel. Glad that I did.4 stars"
