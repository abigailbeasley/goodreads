Some try heavier substances. My drug of choice, my way of clearing my head, calming down and escaping for a few hours, is to run. I am an absolute junkie. Sometimes I feel like I live to run. When I’m not reading, writing or cycling to work, then I’m running. It’s a fantastic experience, blasting my favourite psychedelic rock albums as I lose all my troubles on the road. Anyone who has taken up running seriously will understand how much of a drug it can be. As strange as it may sound, I don’t think I’d be able to write a single review on here or even read a single book if I didn’t run regularly. I’m naturally quite a fidgety person. I have lots of energy and don’t like to sit still. I want to be outside! I also pace up and down a lot if I’m bored. Running calms me down. It allows me to sit at a desk (sometimes all day) writing essays for university. It also means I sleep at night. Without running, I just don’t get much. I end up with about 4-5 hours of sleep because I’m just not tired. I’m then perpetually groggy and moody the next day. Running is such a healthy thing to do, and, as Murakami recognises, for some people it is essential for mental balance. It keeps them sane. Murakami gets running; he understands the point of it. I’ve often been asked: “why do you go running?” or “what’s the point of it?” The answer is simple: I go running to live. Being a literature student, and working in a pretty slow and unphysical environment, means I’m restless. We all need some form of exercise and some time to ourselves to reflect and be introspective. And that's what running is all about, at least for me and the author of this book. For Murakmi it was an essential part of his writing process. In order to write novels, he had to run. As he was aiming for a deadline or the end of story, he was also aiming for a personal best in his next marathon. Ironically, I’m doing the exact same thing. As I approach my dissertation deadline, I’m also training for a marathon. Reading the words of another, who did the same thing as I’m doing, for the same reasons, is really quite revealing. My idea, which makes little sense to my friends and family, was given much more clarity in these pages. To hear another say the same thing, one who was immensely successful, gave me a little confidence boost and some motivation for my marathon. As a treat to myself, I’m actually running it on my birthday.The book takes on the form of a memoir and relays the memories of the author as he trained, competed and eventually reflected upon his experience. There’s much wisdom to be gained from these pages, and, as I said Murakmi gets running, especially the near meditative mind set it can get you in. During long distance runs your mind forgets about the outside world and get into a sort of rhythm with your body, ten miles can pass in an instant as you experience the ""runner's high."" Not all runs are as good as this, but on some you lose yourself. It’s wonderful. Running is wonderful. And, for the right reader, this would be a wonderful book.___________________________________You can connect with me on social media via My Linktree.__________________________________"

Something about the time and place and just all the circumstances match up and you know you read the book at the perfect time? This was that.My drive to immerse myself in the world of writing keeps growing, and I've found so much fun in collecting books about writers and writing that I can't wait to sink into. I had to start somewhere, so I picked up What I Talk About When I Talk About Running because, back when I bought it a few months ago, I'd read the first few pages in the bookshop and it had really piqued my interest.This book is definitely about writing. We learn about Murakami's methods, his work ethic, why he became a writer in the first place, what keeps him writing now. But more than that it is a book about running. About why he loves running, how it has influenced his life, how it interlinks with his writing. It's a journal about his training, his ups and downs, and for a person who really really hate running (no, really, friends, I HATE IT) I found this an absolute pleasure. Sure, this was about running, but it was really about a person who loves something, and I learned so much from his determination and passion and consistency.It was such a meditative reading experience for me, a chance to listen to someone talk about their life and the lessons they've learned, through a journal on running and writing."

Murakami started running in the early 1980's and since then has competed in over twenty marathons and an ultra-marathon.Murakami gives reasons that make him run. Physical fitness is important to him and the constant challenge of breaking the record of the previous day is what motivates him to keep moving until he is forty. The point at which he finds that he cannot improve his times any longer gives him a shock. A motive is thus lost. He is struggling with the fact of getting old and accepting the associated limits of his capabilities. In describing his sport, Murakami also describes his character and his way of coping with life. Without feeling his physical limits again and again, he could not follow his calling as a writer. He combines running with writing in a symbiosis: the one is not possible without the other.عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «از دو (دویدن) که حرف می‌زنم از چه حرف می‌زنم»؛ «وقتی از دویدن صحبت میکنم در چه موردی صحبت می‌کنم»؛ نویسنده: هاروکی موراکامی؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز نخست ماه آوریل سال 2011میلادیعنوان: از دو (دویدن) که حرف می‌زنم از چه حرف می‌زنم؛ نویسنده: هاروکی موراکامی؛ مترجم: مجتبی ویسی ؛ تهران، نشر چشمه، 1388؛ در183ص؛ شابک 9789643627553؛ چاپ سوم 1389؛ چاپ چهارم 1390؛ در 179 ص؛ چاپ ششم 1394؛ موضوع: داستانهای نویسندگان ژاپن - سده 21معنوان: وقتی از دویدن صحبت میکنم در چه موردی صحبت می‌کنم؛ نویسنده: هاروکی موراکامی؛ مترجم: علی حاجی قاسم؛ تهران، نگاه، 1390؛ در160ص؛ شابک 9789643627553؛ چاپ سوم 1389؛ چاپ چهارم 1390؛ در 179ص؛ چاپ ششم 1394؛ وقتی از دویدن صحبت میکنم در چه موردی صحبت میکنم، آرام و ساده است؛ یادمانهای «موراکامی» است، نویسنده ی محبوب «ژاپنی» برنامه ای دقیق و منظم برای دویدن، و شرکت در مسابقات ماراتن دارند، و در این کتاب از لذت این ورزش استقامتی، و تاثیراتی که میتواند روی زندگی و حتی نویسندگی و شخصیت داستانها بگذارد، حرف میزنندتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 06/07/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 09/06/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"

5,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/419287-jessica,Rating 4 out of 5,"I'm a bit baffled by how anyone who's not a distance runner could possibly be interested in this book, but I personally got a lot out of it. This is in spite of the fact that I'm not a Murakami girl, and honestly didn't enjoy the style of this book at all. I always feel when I'm reading him that I've somehow wound up with a crappy translation, but then I realize that I'm reading the same version as all the English-only Murakami lovers out there, so apparently I just don't like the way he writes. Still, I did enjoy this book, and I've given it four stars because I've found since finishing that it's really helped me with my own running. Now when I'm out there pounding the pavement, I think of Murakami and some things he wrote about, and it keeps me going. That's just what I'm after with these exercise books!What I Talk About When I Talk About Running covers three main themes: running, writing, and growing older. This last was sort of a surprise, and was where I drew a large and unexpected amount of comfort, not exclusively related to running. Murakami was in his early thirties when he sold his jazz bar to write a first novel, and he took up distance running around that time. If Murakami can change careers, quit smoking, start running marathons regularly, and become a writer beloved of everyone in the world except for me, well then.... there's hope still for all of us! My life isn't necessarily decided yet, just because I'm nearing thirty. So now when I'm out running, I like to fantasize that I'm a sort of Haruki Murakami/Tilda Swinton figure, who's quit my job in social work to devote myself to my writing career. When I'm not on sabbatical in Hawaii, I live in a sprawling Manhattan castle with my older husband, younger boyfriend, and adorable children, and I take these long, rambling runs through the city to clear my mind for the novel-writing that sustains our unconventional and extremely good-looking family. I am currently at work on a sort of vanity project, this book about exercise called Where I'm Running From, which chronicles my personal journey from indolent vice to literary genius.... I know not all my adoring fans will necessarily enjoy this unconventional little piece, but if it helps a few poor schlumps discover the benefits of running, well then my work is not in vain!I ran 15 miles yesterday, and not a few of those can be dedicated to Murakami, who really isn't a bad running buddy at all, as far as things go. Running is a solitary sport, which is why I like it, and Murakami understands and in some ways ameliorates the legendary loneliness of the long-distance runner. This is why I'm giving it four stars, even though I thought it was badly written. Again, I don't quite see how anyone who isn't a distance runner could get much from this book, and in fact I got bored towards the end when he started talking about triathlons, as I personally don't swim or bike. I do think non-runners could appreciate the description of his ultra-marathon, which was luridly fascinating to me as someone who would never consider running 62 miles and who believes people who do this sort of thing are complete mental cases. However, the main appeal of this book was in being able to relate to it. Murakami wrote about running, writing, and growing older in a way that made me feel better equipped to slog through all three of these often exhausting activities.... that's no small thing!"

7,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29002534-valeriu-gherghel,Rating 4 out of 5,"M-a impresionat dintotdeauna modestia lui Haruki Murakami. Autoportretul... începe ca un jurnal de antrenament pentru maratonul de la New York și continuă ca o meditație despre viață și scris.Cîți dintre noi au oare curajul să afirme cu maximă franchețe că nu dispun de o istețime maximă? Aproape nimeni. Haruki Murakami nu se sfie��te să declare abrupt: „Nu sînt o persoană foarte inteligentă”. Mărturisește că se descurcă greu cu abstracțiunile. Preferă teoriilor concretul palpabil. Peste cîteva rînduri, își atenuează afirmația: „Sigur, un strop de inteligenţă tot am. Cred că am”. Dar nu e un speculativ ca Proust, Mario Vargas Llosa ori Umberto EcoȘi mai spune: „Sînt un om imperfect, un scriitor limitat, care duce o viaţă banală şi plină de contradicţii”. În schimb, își recunoaște o calitate extrem de rară la muritori: e perseverant, silitor, tenace. Poate rezista unui efort îndelungat. În plus, se simte bine în singurătate: „Sînt genul de om care preferă să fie singur”. Cînd s-a apucat de scris? E destul de curios, dar a ținut minte ziua în care s-a hotărît să scrie un roman. Se afla pe un stadion, privea un meci de baseball: Era 1 aprilie 1978, ora unu şi jumătate după-amiaza. Totul a început ca din întîmplare, nu avea ambiții de mărire, nu-și dorea notorietate, nu voia să devină cel mai curtat prozator din univers. Așa a redactat Ascultă cum cîntă vîntul. A fost nominalizat la premiul Akutagawa, nu l-a luat, dar asta nu a avut nici o importanță. În definitiv, recunoaște Murakami, premiul ar fi fost o povară (interviuri, întîlniri cu cititorii, emisiuni). A înțeles, astfel, că destinul lui este să scrie. Odată cu hotărîrea de a scrie și-a modificat radical programul de viață. Nu mai avea de ce să-și piardă nopțile într-un bar (afacerea familiei). Trebuia să-și cultive rezistența fizică, absolut necesară prozatorilor. A convocat un sfat în familie: „Eu şi soţia mea – am decis să ne schimbăm stilul de viaţă. Ne-am hotărît să ne trezim cînd răsare soarele şi să ne ducem repede la culcare după ce se întunecă. Asta era viaţa care ni se părea nouă firească”. Tot din acel moment s-a apucat de jogging și a hotărît să participle la alergări pe distanță lungă. În iulie 1983, a mers în Grecia și a parcurs în alergare „ușoară” drumul de la Atena la Marathon. A fost groaznic. Verile grecești sînt toride, te lichefiezi...În opinia lui Murakami, un scriitor are nevoie de trei calități: de talent, de concentrare și de rezistență. Crede că scrisul unui roman e o specie de „muncă fizică”. Cînd talentul e firav, poți compensa: „Din fericire, spre deosebire de talent, aceste abilităţi (puterea de concentrare şi rezistenţa) se pot dobîndi ulterior şi se pot perfecţiona prin exerciţiu. Dacă te aşezi zi de zi la birou şi exersezi cum să-ţi focalizezi atenţia într-un singur punct, dobîndeşti în mod natural putere de concentrare şi rezistenţă”.Haruki Murakami nu a acceptat niciodată mitul „poetului blestemat”, cultivat de romantici și ilustrat de Verlaine sau Rimbaud. Pentru a scrie un roman interesant nu e nevoie să duci o viață extravagantă. E suficient să te așezi zilnic la masa de scris și să reziști acolo 4-5 ore...P. S. Programul lui Murakami m-a umilit. Nu m-aș putea culca în veci odată cu găinile..."
8,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse-walters,Rating 5 out of 5,"Audiobook.... narrated by Haruki MurakamiListening to Murakami speak about the very universal way our inner voice functions with random thoughts - like clouds in the sky that come and go - was a little taste of heaven for me. Given that I, too, was a runner for 25 years of my life - running marathons - and hilly trail half marathons - often beginning my training runs in the dark with a flashlight — this was absolutely a lovely delightful Audiobook. I enjoyed it very much. I’m familiar with the language- the culture- the drive - the speed training - the setbacks - the injuries- the exhaustion- the pain - the adrenaline rush on race days - the replacement drinks - the log books - the socks and shoes - the chaffing - the spirituality- the emotions - the runner’s high and exhilaration. I’ve been away from running almost as many years as I spent running obsessively......Would I have enjoyed this tape 25 years ago? Not really. I was too busy ‘doing’ my own thing. I wouldn’t have appreciated ‘my own’ accomplishments back then either It wasn’t as though I woke up at 4am - to dress for 33° outside to begin my run and say to myself, “aren’t I inspiring?” Not a chance. BUT NOW.... as an older fart who wouldn’t even consider running today, I can indulge in a few semi- inspiring ( or crazy) - memories from my younger running days. I remember ‘starting’ a marathon in Oakland in the pouring rain.....and it ‘never’ stopped the entire 26.219 miles. Nuts! I was nuts! And exhilarated. Breakfast was delicious afterwards. Listening to Murakami share about himself - his daily running schedule- his running in Hawaii- his attempts to answer the questions “what does he think about when he is running” MIGHT EVEN BE MORE ENJOYABLE - or at least as much - TO THE NON RUNNER - than the runner. As I said .... I don’t think I would’ve enjoyed this audiobook as much when I ‘was’ a runner, as much as I did now. Murakami says .......... he doesn’t really think of anything worth mentioning. ...... he runs to avoid...... occasionally he runs not to get fat...... The only people who ever even ask him the question of what he thinks about when he’s running are people who have never been running and don’t have a clue. ...... he’s not the type of person, we are being alone for five hours, is painful. He enjoys being by himself. ...... he mostly listens to rock music when he runs because the rhythm is the right beat......he talked about being a young runner - then turning 50 - he talked about his emotions about growing old. ...... he talked a few times about competition, and how that is not the world and lifestyle he is after. He simply competes with himself. There’s a lot of wisdom from Murakami. He’s likable and humble. A meditative type of listening and appreciating for me! Lovely as can be! YES....I’m inspired! "

The ‘hurt’ part is an unavoidable reality, but whether or not you can stand anymore is up to the runner himself.”Haruki Murakami’s What I Talk About When I Talk About Running. pairs running and the art of writing (and its demands on focus and endurance). After reading Murakami’s Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage a few weeks ago, I had wanted to read more from this author. Admittedly, What I Talk About has a very different (one might say non-literary) quality which differentiates it from his novel. Still, it was an interesting account in which Murakami describes a nearly lifelong connection between running and how that running impacts his writing, and between aging and the potential decline of creative and physical power. 3.5 stars rounded up to 4."
10,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32804270-michael,Rating 3 out of 5,"A collection of personal essays about writing, endurance, and running, What I Talk About When I Talk About Running considers the impact running has had on the author’s life and work. Over the course of nine short essays, Haruki Murakami travels from Tokyo to Boston as he details his training regimen for the 2005 New York City Marathon and reflects on what running means to him. The author argues for approaching running, like writing, as a way to practice self-discipline on a daily basis, but not to the extent that the idea can serve as a thesis for the book, which comes across as a bit scattered and slight. The essays feel disconnected from each other, and each comes across as a collection of loosely related thoughts on running; Murakami tries but fails to disguise his book’s lack of substance with an abundance of prosaic descriptive passages. The book has some interesting points, but I didn’t feel impacted by it in the way many others on here have been."

12,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34622220-seemita,Rating 5 out of 5,"It was a rainy evening about seven years ago when I entered a book store. It was the perfect refuge – warm lights, thin crowd, a tea bar and loads of books. I marched to the tea bar, ordered a ginger- mint tea, placed my bag on a chair in the seating area and hopped to the alleys to browse for books while the tea was being brewed. Running my eyes like a squirrel, I was surveying the titles one after another when they came to a halt – they spotted a pristine white cover with a circular swirl in blood red. That is it. If the cover art struck me as a bored painter’s good night splash, the name at the bottom of it left me thinking. THE ELEPHANT VANISHES. Err… Has the elephant vanished into the red-white whirlpool? What kind of a book could this be? And then, my eyes fell on the name at the top band of the cover. MURAKAMI. Is it a he or she? A Japanese? A Chinese? A Korean? What kind of genre does s/he write in? Is this a book I want to read now, when the evening is setting in and I am on the verge of being serenaded by some piping hot tea and solitude? I toyed with the idea by reading the blurb. Well, no prizes for guessing that I picked up the book that day. And thus, flagged my relationship with Haruki Murakami. A man, who over the next many years, continued to sway me and surprise me, soothe me and shock me. In his world, ordinary things turned magical; magical became mundane. His idea of love was both endearing and futile, his doggedness both inspiring and fatiguing. He wrote tomes and quickies, short stories and essays, and with every work, left something sparkling for me to wallow in. My journey with him went through Hear the Wind Sing, 1Q84, Kafka on the Shore, Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage, The Strange Library, Kino and Scheherazade and here I am, entering my eighth year with the most wonderful ‘What I Talk About When I Talk About Running’. In this heart-warming, inspiring, anecdotal memoir, Murakami talks about his difficult decision to close his profitable and popular restaurant to dedicate time to writing (which he had just begun doing), and falling on the crutches of running to keep him going. Beginning with short sprints to ending up doing a marathon run of 62 miles in his late 50s, he purged all the negativity off his system and attained a constructive ‘void’, as he calls it. Insulating himself from worldly cacophony and drawing sweet nectar from his inner springs to fortify his writerly pen is what he achieved by running. While reading, I stumbled upon nuggets of wisdom on writing and life like one would accidentally discover a green patch on the sidelines of a long, tarred running pitch. 
“The most important thing we learn at school is the fact that the most important things can’t be learned at school.”“It was a major directional change – from the kind of open life we’d led for seven years, to a more closed life. I learnt a lot of important lessons during that time. It was real schooling. But you can’t keep up that kind of life forever. Just as with school, you enter it, learn something, and then it’s time to leave.”“Emotional hurt is the price a person has to pay in order to be independent.”“I stop everyday right at the point where I feel I can write more. Do that, and the next day’s work goes surprisingly smoothly.""
He further says that the most important traits of an author are talent, focus and endurance, in that order. He should know. With a writing career spanning half a century, the margin of error can well be dispatched to near naught. I shall be biased and wear it on my sleeve, for what can you possibly not love in an intent that sounds like this:
“I felt that the indispensible relationship I should build in my life was not with a specific person, but with an unspecified number of readers.”
The man loves running, another name for embracing life. He began running when he was thirty-three, and he hasn’t stopped since. More vitality, jazz, cats and happiness (and a Nobel) to you, Murakami san. Happy 69th Birthday."

If you're going to while away the years, it's far better to live them with clear goals and fully alive then in a fog, and I believe running helps you to do that. Exerting yourself to the fullest within your individual limits: that's the essence of running, and a metaphor for life — and for me, for writing as whole.""Haruki Murakami ~~ What I Talk About When I Talk About RunningIf you love running, reading, or writing, or are a fan of Haruki Murakami's, this book is for you. What I Talk About When I Talk About Running is a short ~~ by Murakami's standards ~~ memoir on running, life, music and writing. In addition to this, we discover some of his favorite authors, and their works. Note to self: must track down Raymond Carver's What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.Confession time ~~ I'm not a runner. I have no desire to be, but this is a book by Murakami after all so it must be read. To quote the New York Times reviewer: “I’m guessing that the potential readership for “What I Talk About When I Talk About Running” is 70 percent Murakami nuts, 10 percent running enthusiasts and an overlapping 20 percent who will be on the brink of orgasm before they’ve even sprinted to the cash register.” I fall into that 70%. While reading this book, I became enamored with Murakami, the man, and his dedicated, practical, and philosophical approach to life, writing, and running. Murakami didn’t begin running seriously until he was 33, and now runs 6 miles a day rain or shine. He has competed in many marathons, has run a 62K, and competes in triathlons. And thru this all, Murakami describes himself as an average runner, listening to his musical selection for the day ~~ note to self: must track down Lovin' Spoonful Greatest Hits on Spotify ~~ and taking in the beauty of the world around him. Throughout the book, his running consistency and the dedication he shares with the reader becomes a metaphor for his life and the many accomplishments he has earned throughout his career. Murakami doesn't run to win win races; he runs to be healthy and active. He loves to run. I get that. I love to practice inversions. I once spent 40 minutes standing on my head. My friends thought I was nuts, but Murakami would understand.Murakami does not make any claims about how running has completely transformed his life. Nor is he trying to sell us on anything. What he does here is simply share his thoughts on running, and the profound impact it can have on a person without even realizing it. Murakami's dedication to running every day, just like his dedication to writing, comes from his belief that maintaining consistency in anything you do will lead to accomplishing the goals you are seeking. This is not to say that there won’t be fears to be faced, injuries, delays, or frustrations, but that’s part of the experience. This is much the same philosophy Jack London espoused in Martin Eden, a book I highly recommend.The philosophy Murakami most wants to share with us here is that life is about getting a little bit better than where you were. This is also a major theme of his novels. This is mind expanding ~~ it is a lesson for everything we do in this life. Murakami says it even better: 
“For me, running is both exercise and a metaphor. Running day after day, piling up the races, bit by bit I raise the bar, and by clearing each level I elevate myself. At least that’s why I’ve put in the effort day after day: to raise my own level. I’m no great runner, by any means. I’m at an ordinary – or perhaps more like mediocre – level. But that’s not the point. The point is whether or not I improved over yesterday. In long-distance running the only opponent you have to beat is yourself, the way you used to be.”

And I think when most of us read someone that fascinates and/or amazes us, we want to know what that person is like -- what makes him or her tick. And obviously we're almost always disappointed: an amazing mind doesn't equal an amazing person: an interesting mind doesn't equal an interesting person. Who can live up to the novel they write? If the novel is any good, it's impossible. Life is like that: full of disillusionment. What takes place in our imagination sure as hell beats ""reality"". And yet we go through moment to moment thinking we're living in reality-- but really we aren't: Why else do we all disagree so much? We're all living in our own alternate realities and no two are the same.  Getting into a ""runner's zone"" is an experience in which you immerse yourself in your own reality while simultaneously escaping ""reality"" by seeming to look down at it and poke fun of it from afar. During this time your own reality is a directly elevated version of itself; a mimicked but increased version -- full of, and due to -- pain and body awareness. While this is happening your consciousness -- while in part far more adeptly aware than normal (because of the pain) – also seems to float away, allowing you to view your reality from high above. All together, you feel how silly everything is: how intense it all is: how lacking it all is: how everything it all is. And you feel....and you float. And you realize how very much the body and mind are connected, and that patience really is a dear virtue. Life itself is enhanced.""Emotional hurt is the price a person has to pay in order to be independent."" One thing I really like about running is how individualistic it is. You choose where you run; you choose when you run; you choose your own pace; you don't have to worry about getting hit in the head with a ball; no asshole is going to wrestle you to the ground or kick you in the shins: you are by yourself in every important way. It's all you. You listen to yourself, the inner rumblings of your mind and body; you get to know pain and pleasure at their extremes. It's all within you: your choice, your body, your consciousness. We know the world better by knowing ourselves better. And let's be honest: you is all you'll ever be able to trust. You was there from the start and is there now. And you is all there ever was and ever will be."

""لم أبدأ الجري لأن أحدا طلب مني أن أكون عداء، مثلما أنني لم أصبح روائيا لان أحدهم طلب مني ذلك . ذات يوم ، فجأة رغبت بكتابة رواية، وذات يوم ، فجأة ، بدأت بالجري، لأنني أردت ذلك ببساطة . كنت دوما أفعل ما أحب في الحياة ، وقد يحاول الناس منعي وإقناعي أنني مخطئ ، لكني لن أتغير ""


إذا كنت من محبي الجري بالتأكيد ستحب كتاب يتحدث صاحبه عن الجري بهذا الشغف ( ولو مش بتحب الجري هتحب الكتاب برضه من حماس هاروكي وطريقه حكاياته ) 
"" أستطيع القول إن هذه العادة دوناً عن كل عادة اكتسبتها في حياتي ، كانت اكثرها نفعاً وأكثرها معنى . لقد جعلني الجري دون استراحة طوال عقدين أقوى ايضاً ، في بدني وفي عاطفتي ""
  أو لو كنت من محبي هاروكي وشخصيات هاروكي الروائية ستحب التعرف اكثر على اجزاء من حياة هذا الكاتب وشخصيته واهتماماته. 
""لم احتمل إجباري على فعل شئ لم أرغب بالقيام به في وقت لا ارغب فيه بذلك.في المقابل، كلما استطعت فعل ما اود القيام به ، في الوقت الذي أرغب فيه بذلك، بالطريقة التي أريدها، بذلت قصارى جهدي."" 
هاروكي يحكي لنا حياته وقصته مع الجري وكيف ولماذا بدأت ؟! ويحكي لنا ايضا متي وكيف جاءت رغبته في الكتابه ، وحياته قبلها . وكيف اخذ قرار ان يغلق نادي الجاز الخاص به ويتفرغ ويجعل الكتابة مصدر رزقه رغم معارضة الكثير لذلك .




"" أستطيع بدقة تحديد اللحظة التي خطر لي فيها أن اكتب رواية .كانت الساعة الواحدة والنصف تقريبا من بعد ظهيرة الأول من أبريل عام ١٩٧٨ "" 
الى محبي هاروكي : احنا لازم نبروز اليوم ده ❤😅كما نتعرف على جوانب من شخصية هاروكي وهي ليست بعيدة كثيرا عن شخصيات رواياته لذا قلت في البداية ان محبي شخصيات هاروكي الروائية سيحبون هذا الكتاب .هاروكي كشخصياته شخص محب للوحدة ، يعرف متي عليه ان يكون اجتماعي مع الآخرين ثم ككل او اغلب الانطوائيين يبحث عن وقت يكون به بمفرده ، وهاروكي وجد هذا في الجري بجانب طبعا الكتابة . لكن الجري كان منفث لمشاعر وأشياء بداخله . وشئ أحب القيام به بكل تأكيد وكان مفيدا بالنسبة له ليستمر في عمله كروائي . وارتبط كلاهما بالآخر حتى انه يتمنى ان يكتب على قبره أنه "" كاتب ( وعداء ) لم يمش قط على الأقل . ويقصد هنا انه لم يقم بالمشي في السباقات وأثناء ممارسته الجري . 



يتحدث معنا هاروكي عن علاقته بالجري والماراثون ، وتدريباته اليومية وما يفعله للحفاظ عليها واهميتها لديه .وعلاقته ايضا بركوب الدراجة والسباحة للتهيؤ لسباق الترياثلون الذي يتم في ممارسة الثلاث رياضات بشكل متتالي .فنتعرف بذلك على جانب هاروكي الرياضي وشغفه به . ويتحدث عن نفسه كروائي أيضا وعلاقته بالكتابه .وماهي اهم صفات الروائي. ( الموهبة ، التركيز ، الصبر)
""أظن أنني تمكنت من الجري لأكثر من عشرين عاما لسبب بسيط : لأنه يلائمني ،أو على الأقل لأنني لا اراه مزعجاً جداً. يواصل البشر فعل ما يحبون بطبعهم وينقطعون عن فعل ما لايحبون .""


حين تحدث عن بعض الافكار ومشاعره ومايفكر به اثناء الجري ، شعرت به وتفهمته كثيرا . لا أمارس الجري مثله رغم انى تمنيت أن افعل ، لكني أحب المشى وكما يحب هاروكي الجري بمفرده فأنا احب المشي بمفردي وكثيرا ما يساعدني على التخلص من ضيقي وغضبي . مما يذكرني كم تضايقت كثيرا حين كانت ممارسة المشى وتواجدى بالشارع يسبب لي مشكلة ، لم تضايقني المشكلة حينها بقدر ما ضايقني خسارتي لشئ كنت أجد به راحتي . 
""المهم إن كنت اليوم أفضل من البارحة أو لا . إن الخصم الوحيد الذي يتعين عليك هزيمته في جري المسافات الطويلة هو نفسك ، وما أعتدت أن تكون�� .""
حين ت��ب روايات كاتب معين وتأتي أمامك فرصة لتستمع لحديث له بشكل شخصي تتراوح حينها مشاعري بين شيئين متناقضين ، الحماس للقراءة والتعرف عنه بشكل أكبر وأعمق والتعرف على جانب من حياته الحقيقية بعيداً عن كتاباته وفي ذات الوقت أشعر بالخوف الشديد أن اشعر بالصدمة والتناقض تجاه هذا الشخص ، وأن يؤثر ذلك على حبي لهذا الكاتب . لذا ربما يمنعني هذا أحيانا من البحث للتعرف على الكاتب اكثر . لكن تغمرني السعادة حين اتعرف عليه ويزدادا حبي وتعلقي به . وهذا ما حدث هنا مع هاروكي . لقد وجدت اشياء كثيرة في شخصيته وأفكاره قريبة مني بشكل شخصي . وأعجبني عناده وتصميمه على تحقيق ما يريد وان لايتم إجباره على فعل شئ لا يريده . أحببت حماسه في الحديث عن الجري وعن الكتابة وإصراره على تحقيق ما يريد فيهما . وإفتخاره بما إستطاع تحقيقه لأنه يعلم حينها انه بذل ما كان بإستطاعته . أتمنى بجد يكتب سيرة ذاتية عن نفسه ويتكلم فيها اكتر عن حياته وشخصيته .



الكتاب اسلوبه حلو اوى والسرد سلس جدا وحسيت كأن هاروكي قاعد جنبي وبيحكيلى ويتكلم معايا . وحفزني على حاجات كتير اكمل فيها زى ما أنا رغم التريقة اللى بسمعها أحيانا او كثيرا 😅 . ٢٢ / ١٢ / ٢٠٢٢"

17,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7986781-heidi-the-reader,Rating 4 out of 5,"In What I Talk About When I Talk About Running, Haruki Murakami doesn't try to convince others that we should all become long distance runners/triathletes like him. He does talk about why he took up running, how it has helped him with his creativity and why he will continue to run as long as he feels the need to do so.I've never read a book by Murakami, other than this one. But, the interesting way in which he views the world makes me think that I'd probably enjoy his stuff.I listened to this, rather short, audiobook on my daily commute. Murakami shares a lot of intimate details about his life that fans of his writing may really enjoy.Before he took up running, Murakami said he was overweight and smoked around 60 cigarettes a day. 60 per day!He wasn't just looking for a way to become fit. He wanted a exercise where he was left alone with his thoughts and challenged to focus for long periods of time.Murakami says that, when he writes a novel, it is a matter of focus and endurance. He finds it difficult to ""drill down through the rock of the mind to hit veins of creativity."" (Quoting from memory, please forgive the inaccuracies.)The focus that runners use to finish a long race is similar, he believes, to the focus needed to write page after page until the end of a novel. I think that type of mental ability is something that could be used in any creative endeavor, not just writing. For Murakami, writing is how he makes his art.I liked that, even though Murakami loves running and extols its virtues, he says that he never tells other people that they should take it up. He thinks that our life paths reveal themselves to us in a unique way that only we know.He runs because he loves it. If you love it too, run. If you don't, do what you love- walk, skip, jump, swim, whatever.I can get behind that philosophy. Do what makes you happy because that happiness is a clue to what you were born to do.Recommended for writers, runners, Murakami's fans and anyone who enjoys memoirs. What I Talk About When I Talk About Running made me wish that I loved running more. Because I don't."

He has run marathons everywhere including the original Marathon to Athens route (albeit in the wrong season!) and about other long-distance races he ran in.

23,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/102159719-reading-tamishly,Rating 5 out of 5,"So many thoughts after reading this memoir!First of all, I would like to say it's totally bizarre to rate a memoir as is similarly felt by many readers and reviewers. I can understand today what they meant by that. And yes, I can also totally understand when a memoir is rated really low. I have done so too with the memoirs about celebrities and famous people because I just picked up the 'memoir' without actually knowing the personality at all or when the so called 'memoirs' are just pictures and only describe their work as a form of promoting themselves or when the book is written really bad or when it seemed like someone else might have written them or it happens when there is nothing much in them. This particular memoir made me feel like I was reading one of the best written Murakami books. Because I can see the similarity in the writing style/pace as with his other books (fictional). Never have I ever read something about 'sports' like running, marathons, swimming and cycling this invested and I absorbed everything from cover to cover with such zeal.This is one of those rare few books which I am able to relate so much and something which I plan to reread after a decade. This memoir is already like an old friend who I trust with my life and who I would turn to when I feel lost. This book is game-changing for me. This particular memoir has given me so much than I had anticipated. Actually I was a bit apprehensive as I really did not know what to expect from this book as it's a non-fiction by my favourite author who's written only fiction and it seemed to talk about running. What should I expect from this book? Anyway it turned out to be really outspoken and straightforward. To be honest, never in my entire life I would have believed anyone telling me anything that's happening in this memoir to be true unless it's Murakami himself. And it's so amazingly written! The book has nine chapters/essays with an afterward. As the title says, this book talks mostly about the author's journey of running marathons and the other few sports mentioned. He has included some parts regarding his writing and his love for music. I would like to say here that it's better to dive into this memoir blindly without expecting much or as to know more about his work or writing or personal life. And yes, I also feel like you will enjoy this book as much as I do if you like his other books."
24,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3250759-paul-fulcher,Rating 1 out of 5,"I finally reach the end. Strangely, have no feeling of accomplishment. The only thing I feel is utter relief that I don’t have to runread this book anymore.I started this book with two prejudices.First, that the most tedious dinner party conversations typically start with your interlocutor telling you they are in training to run a marathon.Secondly that an author’s work should stand alone from the author - I am with Elena Ferrante here - and that writers writing about themselves or even, perhaps particularly, their writing habits add nothing to their works. The rare exceptions tend to be authors who are a) extraordinary writers and b) whose write their autobiographies in the style of their novels (Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Thomas Bernhard).This book did nothing to dispel either view. Murakami is also no prose stylist, at least as rendered into English. In his novels this doesn’t entirely matter as his prosaic sentences are enlivened by his fantastic imagination, but writing non-fiction one loses that. Take away the talking vanishing cats, girls with pointy ears and the bottom of wells and there is little left. So here for example when discussing his return to Cambridge (the lesser version) and the Charles River we are blessed with the insight that “I’d aged ten years, and there’d literally been a lot of water under the bridge.” Or that the profound thoughts he has while running include “on cold days I guess I think a little about how cold it is. And about the heat on hot days.”There are a tiny handful of interesting nuggets in here about how Murakami became a novelist, perhaps just about enough to make a good New Yorker article, but it doesn’t make for a compelling book when one has to wade through running logs (why would anyone else care how many miles he ran in August 2005?! Or what time he did in the New York marathon?) to dig them out. And even with the nuggets it is more interesting to read the versions of his life as represented in his fiction (e.g. loner starts a jazz cafe) than here. He may have been better writing a book about his bowel habits. More universal and of greater relevance to books (reading at least). And imagine if he had done so and we were greeted by comments such as - books are like bowel movements: sometimes one rushes out of you while others are only squeezed out with lots of time, effort and even pain. Genuinely that is the level of the 'running is like writing a book' insights we get here.Tedious and not at all illuminating."

32,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2755169-anh,Rating 4 out of 5,"Đây không phải là một bài review, chỉ là mình viết lảm nhảm về những suy nghĩ của mình sau khi đọc hơn một nửa cuốn sách này. Mình thấy thật là hay vì mình đọc cuốn này ngay sau khi đọc lại lần thứ 2 cuốn"" Tuổi trẻ, Tình yêu, Lý tưởng"" của Thích Nhất Hạnh. Đọc 2,3 cuốn sách của Thích Nhất Hạnh có thể thấy ông là một người cổ súy cho lối sống chậm rãi, ung dung, nhàn nhã : ""Giấc mơ Việt Nam là dân tộc Việt Nam biết để thì giờ ra để đi chơi, ngồi chơi, leo núi, đi biển, sống với cảnh đẹp thiên nhiên, hàng ngày có nhiều cơ hội dựng xây tình huynh đệ mà không để hết thì giờ chạy theo sắc dục, tiền bạc, quyền hành và danh vọng."" (Tuổi trẻ, Tình yêu, Lý tưởng ). Ngược lại, Haruki Murakami có lẽ là người chủ trương gò mình vào kỷ luật, tự đặt ra các mục tiêu, coi trọng việc chiến thắng bản thân, vượt qua các giới hạn của chính mình. Điều này được thể hiện rõ qua việc ông miêu tả cách đặt ra kế hoạch, duy trì chạy bộ hằng ngày trong nhiều năm; cách ông tập trung hết sức 3-4h/ngày vào viết lách ( thậm chí phải ngồi tập trung từng đó thời gian tại bàn làm việc mỗi ngày, kể cả khi không viết lách gì). Và tuy không đề cập đến nhiều trong tác phẩm, nhưng có thể hình dung ra việc ông duy trì kỷ luật trong các sinh hoạt khác của đời sống hằng ngày ra sao.Điều này không khó hiểu khi Murakami là người Nhật( ai cũng biết người Nhật coi trọng kỷ luật như thế nào) và bị ảnh hưởng nhiều bởi lối sống và văn hóa Mỹ.Việc đọc 2 cuốn sách gần như kế tiếp nhau, giúp cho mình có nhiều suy nghĩ và so sánh giữa 2 phong cách sống. Không hoàn toàn chính xác, và cũng không phải là tất cả, mình thấy phong cách sống thứ nhất có vẻ là phong cách sống của nhiều người Việt Nam và người dân ở nhiều nước châu Âu.Quan sát có thể thấy được rằng thanh thiếu niên, dân văn phòng Việt Nam ngồi cà phê cà pháo, trà chanh trà đá, uống bia hơi nhiều đến mức nào. Trong "" Tuổi trẻ, Tình yêu, Lý tưởng"" Thích Nhất Hạnh cũng nói về việc nhiều người dân Pháp làm việc 35h/tuần ( tức là trung bình 5h/ngày; còn nếu tính là 1 tuần 2 ngày nghỉ tức là làm việc 5 ngày/tuần thì trung bình cũng dưới mức 8h/ngày). Họ dành thời giờ cho người thân, gia đình và đi du lịch. Đọc "" Ngón tay mình còn thơm mùi oải hương"" cũng thấy Ngô Thị Giáng Uyên mô tả về những người châu Âu rất hay ngồi quán cà phê , bia hơi "" lười biếng nhìn cuộc đời chậm rãi trôi"". Cách sống thứ 2 có lẽ là cách sống của người Nhật và người Mỹ. Khỏi phải nói về người Nhật. Còn những người mình quen đã và đang làm việc ở Mỹ, luôn kêu ca về áp lực và cường độ công việc. Kỷ luật, kỷ luật, kỷ luật. Công việc, công việc, công việc. Luôn đứng trước nguy cơ có thể bị sa thải bất cứ lúc nào, nếu bạn không đứng trong nhóm những người xuất sắc và chăm chỉ nhất.( Điều này càng rõ hơn khi suy thoái kinh tế xảy ra gần đây).Vậy mình thấy mình phù hợp với lối sống nào hơn, và xa hơn nữa là mình chọn cho mình lối sống nào ? Mình không thật sự biết. Mình nghĩ lâu nay mình sống theo lối sống thứ nhất. Tuy nhiên, trong thâm tâm mình luôn nghĩ rằng để đạt được một điều gì đó, hay nói rõ hơn là để làm tốt mọi việc,để thành công trong sự nghiệp, mình phải sống theo cách thứ 2. Mình cũng nghĩ rằng: việc sống như vậy là một trong những lý do quan trọng làm cho nước Mỹ trở thành cường quốc số 1 thế giới chỉ sau lịch sử mấy trăm năm và cũng chính việc sống như vậy làm cho nước Nhật luôn phục hồi một cách nhanh chóng và trở lại mạnh mẽ sau bất cứ một thảm họa nào. Mình đã luôn nghĩ như vậy từ khá lâu. Tuy nhiên, việc đọc lại cuốn sách của Thích Nhất Hạnh khiến mình đặt ra câu hỏi rằng: việc sống như vậy có thật sự tốt cho việc tồn tại và phát triển bền vững không? Nói như vậy có vẻ mơ hồ, nhưng phần nào đó nó giống như chuyện để đẩy mạnh việc phát triển kinh tế, con người làm việc quần quật, không ngừng nghĩ ra các phương thức khai thác tất cả các tài nguyên thiên nhiên có thể, không cho thiên nhiên có điều kiện "" nghỉ ngơi"" và phục hồi."" Không cho đất nghỉ, không ngừng tay ta"" ( Bài ca vỡ đất- Hoàng Trung Thông ). Điều đó đã và đang dẫn đến hậu quả thế nào thì ai cũng thấy.Từ chuyện sống nhanh và sống chậm( tạm gọi như vậy ), từ lâu mình cũng có nhiều suy nghĩ về việc đọc sách nhanh hay chậm. Phải nói là mình khá dị ứng với những kiểu dạy các phương pháp đọc sách nhanh và cả cái việc đặt mục tiêu cho mình tháng này, năm này phải đọc bao nhiêu cuốn sách ( có vẻ giống với việc Murakami tự đặt ra mục tiêu cho mình khi chạy bộ). Mình biết là mình KHÔNG nên dị ứng như vậy, vì RÕ RÀNG rằng cách đọc sách nhanh có rất nhiều lợi ích, không phải bàn cãi. Dù dị ứng nhưng nhiều lúc mình cũng áp dụng nó. Tuy nhiên, mình nghĩ rằng cái quan trọng không kém, thậm chí quan trọng hơn cả việc đọc sách nhanh như thế nào, đọc nhiều sách ra sao đó là việc hiểu cuốn sách đó như thế nào, áp dụng điều mình hiểu vào trong thực tế cuộc sống ra sao. Ví dụ, như trong việc mình đọc sách của Thích Nhất Hạnh. Mình đã đọc khá nhiều sách của ông. Về bản chất, nội dung của các cuốn sách này hầu như không khác nhau, lặp đi lặp vài nội dung cơ bản. Nhưng nếu như hằng ngày mình không luyện tập và áp dụng cách kiềm chế cơn bão cảm xúc, vẫn văng tục chửi bới loạn xạ mỗi khi gặp điều gì đó tức tối,vẫn giữ nhiều suy nghĩ phải nói là cực đoan, thì về cơ bản việc đọc sách của mình không có ý nghĩa gì hết. Mặt khác, có nhiều cuốn sách đáng đọc đi đọc lại và nghiền ngẫm thật kỹ. Đọc một cuốn sách vào những thời điểm khác nhau, những độ tuổi khác nhau, cảm nhận và suy nghĩ có thể sẽ khác nhau rất nhiều. Nhận ra suy nghĩ và con người mình thay đổi qua việc đọc lại một cuốn sách là một điều thú vị. Một năm chỉ đọc một cuốn sách cũng được, đọc thật chậm cũng được nếu như cảm thấy mình cần phải suy nghĩ thật kĩ và từ đó rút ra những bài học để áp dụng vào cuộc sống. ( Tuy nhiên, vấn đề là nhiều khi phải đọc nhiều để có thể so sánh và có cái nhìn toàn diện, hehe). Đọc sách không phải là nhồi đất vào đầu, không phải giống như học phổ thông ở Việt Nam để chỉ đơn thuần là đặt ra mục tiêu đọc bao nhiêu cuốn sách 1 năm, đọc bao nhiêu từ 1 phút. ( Giống như mục tiêu mỗi lớp đạt bao nhiêu học sinh khá và giỏi, tỉ lệ tốt nghiệp đạt 99,99%, chi tiền thật đậm để Việt Nam có đại học đạt tốp 200 thế giới...)Tóm lại, đây là một cuốn sách đáng để đọc lại nhiều lần, và dù không phải điều gì mình cũng tán thành với Murakami, nhưng nó gợi cho mình rất nhiều suy nghĩ."

Murakami is the epitome of this Latin quote from Juvenal ""mens sana in corpore sano"", a healthy mind in a healthy body.Murakami chooses to open his journal to tell us about his life as an athlete and compare it to his profession as a writer.I didn't feel much empathy for the character - he's selfish and not warm - or admiration for the writer - a prevalent style.However, the philosophy that emerged from this book seemed correct: talent, concentration, and perseverance are the ingredients of his success as an athlete and writer.The story of his races is sometimes redundant, but his first 100 km is impressive, just like his first triathlon. He describes very well the suffering of the end of the race.I don't always agree with him; I don't think you have to run every day to be efficient and systematically compensate for the day you missed with a more challenging session. With equal training, three-quarters of runners of his level (3:45 in the marathon) would be injured.His advice should only concern him because he is too forceful. But he does not hide his shortcomings, and finally, his dedication and constancy in the effort (25 years of running races) have inspired me with respect."

35,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/90786-lee-klein,Rating 4 out of 5,"An ideal book for writer runners (or running writers), but also probably worth it for non-running/non-writing readers as there's enough straight talk and suggestion about serious themes: enduring pain, aging, the importance of routine, self-awareness/alertness. Quick, lean, honest, at times amazing, occasionally mundane, definitely worthwhile. BUT WAIT! The really cool thing about this book is that it's also about authority. Murukami has run +25 marathons (including a +62-mile supermarathon) and written several novels. He's repeatedly done very difficult things to do. It makes sense to listen up when someone like him talks about what he talks about when he talks about how he's successfully spent his life. Some seem to object that this book wouldn't have been published by an unpublished author. But the deal is it COULDN'T HAVE BEEN WRITTEN by anyone else. This second paragraph is more a review of a book review than a review of a book: I just read Geoff Dyer's kind of idiotic review in Sunday's Book Review. It's sort of idiotic because half of it is sort of devoted to the translated use of ""sort of"" and ""kind of."" I used to like Geoff Dyer, but I think he just pretty seriously slipped. Much better would've been a quick suggestion that a Knopf editor could have cleaned things a bit, or a more generous approach saying that the ""sort of"" repetitions make for easy, conversational, congenial reading, or maybe even an interpretative stretch about a Japanse hesitancy to make unqualified assertions? Instead, Geoff Dyer condescends to Murakami (a man who's written how many novels and run how many marathons?) when Dyer suggests that Murakami is uncool for listening to Clapton or the Lovin' Spoonful! I'm sure when Dyer writes about fingerblasting his girlfriend in Southeast Asia (""my fingers grew so wet it was like oil pouring through them""), he listens to something way cooler - my guess: later work of Todd Rundgren. The immortal masterpieces of Sting? Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's duets with Eddie Vedder? The Buena Vista Social Club?!I also realized yesterday that this book helped my endurance while on a long run - wasn't feeling so hot but I thought of Haruki on the 62+ mile run and made it all the way home without stopping. If just to please Geoff Dyer, you ask what was I listening to? ""Paris au Printemps,"" a live album by Public Image Limited -- perfect running music for me."

I'm not a runner (more of an elliptical guy) but this book is as much about aging, creativity, acceptance, and finding your own peace with who you are (ok, that sounds way more new agey than I mean) as marathons.

Don't be fooled by the slim nature of this volume; you can tell Murakami put a lot of soul into What I Talk About When I Talk About Running."
37,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5022264-ian-marvin-graye,Rating 4 out of 5,"What I Talk about When I Talk about WalkingI was originally more of a sportsman (or a sportsboy) than an athlete.As a schoolboy, I absolutely hated running any distance over 100 meters. I was the second fastest in my year at the 100 meter sprint (there were two able males in my grade!), and for a while I could even do the 100 meters hurdles. Although I loved surfing and body surfing, I was hopeless at swimming anything but across the pool. I just wasn't made out for anything but team sports (where I could be hidden from the opposition).Nevertheless, I continued to run for about an hour almost every day or night until I was 40. My motivation was that the more I exercised, the more I could eat and drink.My wife, F.M. Sushi, and I got married when I was 33 and she was about 29. She had been a national heptathlon champion and was then a personal trainer. We only ever ran with each other twice. Once was at Noosa national park on our honeymoon, when I twisted my ankle on the dirt path along the ocean edge of the park. The other was when we decided to run the Gold Coast Half Marathon ""together"" (no, it wasn't a three-legged race!). I had practised a lot for it by running up to 15 kilometers each day, but I had never run any distance longer than this. From that point onwards in the actual race, I just couldn't continue physically or mentally, though I nevertheless finished it in two hours. F. M. Sushi described running so slowly that she could keep up with me as the most tedious thing she had ever done in her life. She was literally running circles around me and I could still never get ahead of her. I ran for a few more years after that (once I recovered), but eventually gave it up, first in order to use an exercise bike, and then to walk. From that point onwards, I walked at least one hour pretty much every morning of the week. Until about three years ago, I actually boosted the time to three hours, but I was finding that I suffered from fatigue and muscular tightness in my calves. I now walk 75 minutes every morning. My average speed is about 10 minutes per kilometer. So that's about 7 1/2 kilometers per day. I also walk our dog, Charlie, for about 30 minutes most afternoons. I have to walk circles around him every time he finds a tree.I listen to music when I walk. I have hundreds of playlists that I've made of my music collection, and this is about the only time I get to listen to them. I used to type messages and compose faux-poetry on GoodReads during my walks, until I tripped over a fallen branch on the footpath and almost broke my arm towards the end of last year.Apart from these injuries, I found that walking as soon as I woke up (usually to get home) cleared my mind and boosted my mental energy, so that when I started work or my writing, I was ready to commit a full day to the task. I also assumed that it might have prolonged my life, but I'm not sure whether that is the case. I've almost been run over three times on my walks, twice by buses and once by a cyclist being chased by a magpie.I broke my arm a few months ago, in a fall on the courtyard outside our home. Some complications with my shoulder muscles or tendons prevented me walking for a few weeks (I should clarify that I normally walk on my feet!). When I resumed, I felt that things I could once do easily (hills, distances) were more demanding than they had been, and I've had a greater sense of mortality than ever before.What I Talk about When I Talk about Running WritingHaruki Murakami started running about the same time he started writing novels (at age 33). He describes the physical aspects of writing as unhealthy or bad for his body or a ""toxin"". Part of his reason for running is to prolong his writing life, by expelling this toxin.Running is also vital to the frame of mind he requires for his creativity:""I'm the type of person who doesn't find it painful to be alone. I find spending an hour or two every day running alone, not speaking to anyone, as well as four or five hours alone at my desk, to be neither difficult nor boring...the hour or so I spend running, maintaining my own silent, private time, is important to help me keep my mental well-being. ""When I'm running I don't have to talk to anybody and don't have to listen to anybody. All I need to do is gaze at the scenery passing by...I just run. I run in a void. Or maybe I should put it another way: I run in order to acquire a void...""I probably shouldn't be looking up at [clouds]. What I should be looking at is inside me. Like staring down into a deep well.""Despite its energetic subject matter, this non-fiction work is written in a relatively relaxed and conversational style. It describes the self-discipline required to be a long distance runner and consistently imaginative writer. Murakami reveals a little of both his soul and his soles. This is probably as close to a memoir as we're likely to get from one of my favourite authors."

Love it, for very personal reasons, naturally because I love writing and like running. Actually thinking when will be my first marathon before reading this book. I bassically try to avoid Murakami's novels as I want to be positive and I don't like the sorrow in his stories, it rottens my heart and stings my head. But this book is excellent. There are a mild sadness and deep philosophy typical of him, but it gives me practical lessons and strength to act, on my writing and running. His writing is so great that reading this book makes me want to swear and quit writing on one hand, yet keeps me passionate and eager to write and run more on the other hand.

43,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14046996-roy-lotz,Rating 4 out of 5,"I think I enjoyed this book more than its slim contents really justify. This is due to a confluence of interests: Murakami is a marathon-running novelist, and I, too, am a writer (amateur) and runner (very amateur). So a lot of the pleasure of this book was aspirational life-envy. Waking up, working on a piece of fiction, and then heading out for a long run in some scenic spot—this sounds like a perfect day to me. The book is a kind of meditation on the act of running and what it means to Murakami and his work as a novelist. I cannot say that any of it is especially profound; but if you write or run it will likely be compelling. Not that Murakami has any special knowledge about training methods or the history of running or anything along those lines. Rather, his reflections are purely introspective. Why does he run? What role does running play in his life? How has his attitude towards running changed as he got older?This was my first Murakami book, and I was surprised at how much I enjoyed his writing style. He comes across as humble, private, and introverted, but full of a determination to live life on his own terms—which is by far his most attractive quality. In fact, as I listened to this audiobook on my own runs, I found Murakami’s quiet determination so inspiring that I ran faster and farther than I have in quite a while. Now, that’s a quality book."

Αυτό δεν ισχύει πάντα, βέβαια αλλά σύμφωνα με την εμπειρία μου θα λεγα ότι τα απαισιόδοξα παραδείγματα υπερτερούν. Ο αγγελιοφόρος ακουμπάει με το δάχτυλο το καπέλο του και έχει ύφος απολογητικό, όμως αυτό δεν βελτιώνει ούτε στο ελάχιστον το περιεχόμενο του μηνύματος. Δε φταίει ο αγγελιοφόρος.

Παρόλα αυτά βρήκα το βιβλίο αυτό εξαιρετικά ενδιαφέρον. Μπορεί φαινομενικά να δείχνει ένα αδιάφορο βιβλίο και σίγουρα δεν είναι το πλέον αντιπροσωπευτικό βιβλίο για να κάνετε μια πρώτη γνωριμία με το συγγραφέα αν δεν εχει τυχει να πέσει ξανα στα χέρια σας κάποιο βιβλίο του όμως για τους πιστούς του φίλους είναι μια εξαιρετική θα έλεγα ανάγνωση ένος άλλου Μουρακάμι, του Μουρακάμι πίσω από τις σελίδες ενός βιβλίου.

Στο συγκεκριμένο λοιπόν βιβλίο έπιασα πολλες φορές τον εαυτό μου να διαβάζει με αμέριστη προσοχή όλο αυτό το τελετουργικό που ακολουθεί τη συγγραφή ενός βιβλίου. Πραγματικά θαύμασα το πείσμα και την υπομονή του και την πειθαρχία του. Μη σας πω ότι ήθελα να βάλω τα αθλητικά και να πάω για τρέξιμο μαζί του. Ταυτίστηκα πολύ. Εγώ αυτό το κάνω με το περπάτημα για παράδειγμα. Οκ δεν το κανω για να μαι φιτ για να γραφω βιβλια μέχρι τα γεράματα αλλά πάντα με βοηθά να καθαρίζει το μυαλό μου και να κατεβαζει νέες ιδεες. Νομιζω ότι αυτό ηθελε να περάσει και ο ιδιος. Πόσο σημαντική είναι η συγκέντρωση και να ξεδίνεις με κάτι που αγαπάς και δεν το κάνεις από αγγαρεία. Αλλωστε το λεει ότι δεν εγραψε το βιβλίο για να μας κάνει να αρχίσουμε το τρέξιμο που εδώ που τα λέμε δεν το βλέπω και πολύ πιθανό εκτός αν στη γραμμή τερματισμού υπάρχουν 8 κιλά σοκολάτες αλλά για να μας περάσει το πόσο σημαντικό είναι στη ζωή του και πως συμβάλλει στη συγγραφική του ιδιότητα.

The book, of course, takes its title from Raymond Carver's early short story collection, which Murakami had translated into Japanese.He's merciless in his honest assessment of his achievements both literary and athletic, and there are some great descriptions of runs, including one in sweltering conditions from Athens to Marathon (site of the first marathon), and an ""ultramarathon"" (62 miles) that was so punishing he could barely walk afterwards.I used to run regularly, but hardly the sort of distances depicted in the book. Reading this master craftsman makes me want to head back outside again, if only for the mind-clearing rush.Maybe it'll happen. If so, I'll likely refer to this book again after dusting off my jogging shoes and stretching my tired old muscles. "
51,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22699228-matt-quann,Rating 5 out of 5,"My running companion over the past two and a half weeks has been Haruki Murakami; at least, narrator Ray Porter channeling Murakami. What I Talk About When I Talk About Running is more empathetic memoir than self-help book, but I have no doubt in my mind that Murakami helped to boost my running game. After a few runs I began to think of the audiobook as a philosophical coach. I’d recommend this memoir to seasoned runners as well as relative newbies like myself! I decided to only listen to the audiobook while I was out for my runs. I’d been averaging 30-minute runs, with the occasional foray into longer runs and Murakami’s chapters roughly equaled the length of my runs. Reluctantly, I replaced the bass-heavy hip-hop that usually soundtracks my runs for the voice of Ray Porter as he read what is essentially a memoir about running. I’ll admit that it took a chapter or two before I was fully committed to my initial plan. I’ll occasionally throw on an audiobook or podcast during my runs, but usually once a week while the rest of my running time is reserved for pouring over new and old music. Soon my need for earth-shattering bass and bar-spitting over trap beats gave way to the calm and tranquil ponderings of a man that runs far further distances than I had ever dreamed. My thoughts during runs before this book ranged from you should stop, you should stop, you should stop to this is slightly better than dying early from cardiovascular disease. Murakami’s cool philosophy and matter-of-fact account of his sufferings during his runs helped both to let me know I wasn’t alone and that I didn’t have much to complain about. I mean, the man is running for 1-2 hours daily for 6 days of the week. My god! It is also reassuring, in some perverse way, that Murakami’s legs still scream out, cramp, and he stops from exhaustion even after all his training. His honesty was my favorite part of the book: he doesn’t achieve some insane goal, destroy records, and get a personal best every race. He struggles, he persists, and that struggle in and of itself is satisfying. I’ll admit that when I started to run seriously, at least 3-4 times per week, I did so for three reasons: to stave off morbidity and mortality from a family history of obesity, to have a convenient form of exercise, and—I’m not shamed to admit it—vanity. But those aren’t the reasons I kept running. Even when my schedule got busy, I kept up with my regular running and had to admit there was something more than my initial reasons for starting to run.Murakami helped to crystallize this motivation for me. Running for running itself is rewarding. The attempt to pound yourself and your screaming muscles, lungs, and psyche into submission yields both an amazing sense of personal accomplishment and a supreme runners’ high. The act of running became less of a chore for me as Murakami spoke of brutal courses and events in which he’s participated. Most runners, like myself, will find much to sympathize with here and it is that sense that you are not alone, but the run depends entirely on you, that helped motivate me run after run.For those of you who follow my reviews religiously—hi mom!—you might be surprised to read that I took on more Murakami after a pretty acrimonious split in the fall. Lisa was kind enough to gift me with the audiobook after a particularly challenging rotation. She hoped the book would help to encourage both my running and my writing. I’m sure that there’s a lot of difference between his nonfiction and fiction, but this book has opened the door for Murakami to come back into my reading life. Today, for my final run with Murakami, I decided to listen to the entirety of the last hour in a single go. The run started out brutal. The lateral aspects of my feet both ached and there was a constant dull throb in my calves despite a decent stretch the night before. I’m just getting over a cold too, so I was still hacking, spewing, and snorting as I ran. This was exactly the type of run that I would have aborted twenty minutes in before this book. So, despite my body’s protests, I persisted. I’m happy to say that Murakami helped to get through a run that I would have abandoned before his audiobook. Thanks to this audiobook I’m a better runner, and I believe it’s helped out my writing too! I’ve avoided talking too much about Murakami’s revelations about reading, writing, and running since they are so much of what makes the audiobook great. Suffice to say, it all works very well as a companion on the trails and treadmills. To my fellow runners out there, I can’t recommend this one enough"

He writes about the successes and failures, the effect of ageing and his reasons why he runs and keeps running. For me, I felt the first half of the book was more clear and easy read than later, a bit like running a marathon can be. The mood throughout shows the author's general character, and the text never gets boring. It's an easy read, not too long. Although I know I will never pick up running - love my knees too much to wear them out more, among other things - it's interesting to read what it's like for those who do. And reading about Hawaii and the Massachusetts Cambridge was also worth the reading. So it's definitely a recommended read. :)"

Ecco. Io alle 6 di mattina vado a correre, così, come se niente fosse.. Rendiamoci conto della cosa!Il perché e il percome io sia finita in questa situazione è presto detto: Murakami ha toccato le corde giuste non presentando la corsa come una cosa fyghissima e bellissima (seriamente, chi sarebbe caduto in un trabocchetto così sgamabile? :D).. No, Murakami me l'ha presentata come un'occasione per sfidare sé stessi e per superare i propri limiti (palesemente quelli fisici, nel mio caso anche psicologici che mi impediscono di praticare sport senza prima piangere disperatamente :D) in un vero e proprio trionfo d'orgoglio. Man mano che leggevo ha fugato i miei dubbi e le mie 'paure', ridimensionando il tutto a qualcosa di assolutamente fattibile.. Insomma, volere è potere!Sono parecchio contenta di aver letto questo libro, non solo per la palese epifania riguardante lo sport (e che epifania!) ma soprattutto perché con Murakami ho da qualche tempo un rapporto conflittuale e difficile.. Pensavo sinceramente che tra noi due si fosse spenta la passione e l'amore fosse terminato.. Invece vedo un po' di luce in fondo al tunnel!L'ho conosciuto con ""Norwegian wood"" ed è stato un amore fulmineo e profondo; l'ho continuato ad adorare con ""La ragazza dello Sputnik"" e ""Dance dance dance"", ma la sintonia si è rotta con ""South of the Border, West of the Sun"" e ""La fine del mondo e il paese delle meraviglie""; ""1Q84"" è addirittura riuscito ad entrare fra i dieci libri più brutti che io abbia mai avuto il dispiacere di leggere, non so se rendo :(Bene, dopo la storia della mia vita che non interessa nessuno, dicevo.. Sono contenta di aver ripreso un po' i rapporti con Murakami perché non penso che senza di questo libro avrei letto altro di suo!Il libro ovviamente non si limita a descriverci di lui che corre - come quanto e perché -, ma ci permette anche di conoscere il Murakami non autore.. Non penso che Murakami sia la persona più simpatica del pianeta e anzi.. Probabilmente è proprio vero il contrario: molti passaggi del romanzo mi hanno dato questa sgradevole sensazione anche se talvolta invece mi è molto piaciuto.. Sono combattuta!! La vita del Murakami corridore si intreccia inevitabilmente con il Murakami scrittore e questa piccola incursione nel suo modus operandie sull'inizio della sua carriera come novellista ha un sapore molto intimo, mi è piaciuta!!Poi vabbé, si può dire quello che si vuole ma di certo non che Murakami non sappia scrivere e qui ritroviamo tutta la sua potenza descrittiva e tante chicche davvero interessantissime!So my new, simple, and regular life began. I got up before five a.m. and went to bed before ten p.m. People are at their best at different times of day, but I’m definitely a morning person. That’s when I can focus and finish up important work I have to do. Afterward I work out or do other errands that don’t take much concentration. At the end of the day I relax and don’t do any more work. I read, listen to music, take it easy, and try to go to bed early. This is the pattern I’ve mostly followed up till today. Thanks to this, I’ve been able to work efficiently these past twenty-four years. It’s a lifestyle, though, that doesn’t allow for much nightlife, and sometimes your relationships with other people become problematic. Some people even get mad at you, because they invite you to go somewhere or do something with them and you keep turning them down.But in real life things don’t go so smoothly. At certain points in our lives, when we really need a clear-cut solution, the person who knocks at our door is, more likely than not, a messenger bearing bad news. It isn’t always the case, but from experience I’d say the gloomy reports far outnumber the others. The messenger touches his hand to his cap and looks apologetic, but that does nothing to improve the contents of the message. It isn’t the messenger’s fault. No good to blame him, no good to grab him by the collar and shake him. The messenger is just conscientiously doing the job his boss assigned him. And this boss? That would be none other than our old friend Reality."

I too enjoy running. Granted the most I've done is a 10k, but the mindset is definitely on par. I too correlate my professional success with a life long passion of staying physically active. The author is a marathon and triathlon athlete, but I am a body builder. A lot of the training and mental processes are extremely similar. This book has even got me thinking about my age for first time as being a limiting factor in my physical successes. I love that the author never feels like it's too late to pick up something new. He also doesn't feels like it's ever too late to get professional help on improving yourself. I have been bodybuilding for 17 years and this year I have made the most progress of my life due to seeking out professional advice for the first time since I started. No matter how much you think you know about something there is always something new to learn and there is always conflicting viewpoints that may make you reconsider your mindset entirely."

I enjoyed it for all of those reasons. But it was also rich with life lessons about aging, persistence, the nature of pain, the meaning of failure, and (yes) why we do what we do."

60,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3815302-libby,Rating 4 out of 5,"3.5 stars rounded up. I came to know Haruki Murakami as a very disciplined man through this memoir. He developed strong habits of running as well as writing and they seemed to go together hand in glove. How he received his inspiration to write a novel was fascinating. As he describes it, he was at Jingu Stadium watching the Yakult Swallows play baseball when Dave Hilton, the new American player hit the ball. Murakami was thirty years old drinking beer and watching the game when “something flew down from the skies.” He received the notion that he would write a novel. He had no ideas for his novel at that time nor any desire to become a novelist, but that is exactly what happened.Murakami writes that when he first started running it was only for short distances, but even that left him feeling shaky and breathless. As he hones his long-distance running skills, he conditions his body. He makes many correlations to his development as a novelist to his conditioning as a runner. His discipline at giving time to each created growth in his capabilities. He started to develop more health regimens and gave up smoking. He began to incorporate more vegetables into his diet and fish became his main protein. These healthy habits are all things I’m familiar with, but listening to Murakami talk about his health habits is still incredibly inspiring.I count this as my first book with this author. I tried to read 1Q84 years ago, but it was a DNF for me, probably a book that I would find quite interesting now as my reading proclivities have changed. I listened to this memoir as an audiobook with Ray Porter as the narrator. Mr. Porter had a good voice for narrating with clear, easy to understand pronunciation. I give Porter 3.5 for narration. Having read Murakami’s memoir, I’m more interested in reading his other work and feel like I know more about him, not as an author, but as a person. I sense that he is proud of his discipline but not in an egotistical way, more in a pragmatic way. I enjoyed his stories of what discipline can bring to a runner or a writer, which I believe can be transposed to many other fields of study or practice."

Well, he's more into running but he did quite a few tris.I enjoyed reading his thoughts about his running philosophy/mantras. For example, he shared some interesting ideas about pain that I would need to guide me in two weeks for my first Ironman 70.3. “Of course it was painful, and there were times when, emotionally, I just wanted to chuck it all. But pain seems to be a precondition for this kind of sport. If pain weren't involved, who in the world would ever go to the trouble of taking part in sports like the triathlon or the marathon, which demand such an investment of time and energy? It's precisely because of the pain, precisely because we want to overcome that pain, that we can get the feeling, through this process, of really being alive--or at least a partial sense of it. Your quality of experience is based not on standards such as time or ranking, but on finally awakening to an awareness of the fluidity within action itself.” “Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional. Say you’re running and you think, ‘Man, this hurts, I can’t take it anymore. The ‘hurt’ part is an unavoidable reality, but whether or not you can stand anymore is up to the runner himself.” I also found out some interesting facts about his personality and his life. Beside talking about running the books was also a memoir. “I didn't start running because somebody asked me to become a runner. Just like I didn't become a novelist because someone asked me to. One day, out of the blue, I wanted to write a novel. And one day, out of the blue, I started to run-simply because I wanted to. I've always done whatever I felt like doing in life. People may try to stop me, and convince me I'm wrong, but I won't change.” He also included a series of truths about life in general. “I am struck by how, except when you're young, you really need to prioritize in life, figuring out in what order you should divide up your time and energy. If you don't get that sort of system set by a certain age, you'll lack focus and your life will be out of balance.” I thought that the structure of the book was poor and I was a little confused by the chronological fluctuations. All in all, this is a book for people who enjoy to run/tri and would also like to know some things about Murakami and how writing a novel and running go hand in hand. "
63,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5885760-andrew-smith,Rating 5 out of 5,"I read this book some years ago but didn’t get around to capturing my thoughts on it. At the time I was deep into my midlife crisis period which, for me, included a desire to prove that I could still compete with the younger generations at something – for this enterprise I chose long distance running. I’d run the London Marathon in 1982 (the second year it was held) and I’d pretty much not run since, albeit I’d been active playing football, tennis and just about everything else through the remainder of my 20’s and into my early 30’s. Then a punctured lung one Sunday morning, during a football kick around, put an end to that sport, and pretty much all others - I turned chicken! - for too many years. Then, as I reached the age of 50 I decided it was time to get a little fitter. I jogged a little and found it tough, but stuck with it. It took some time but eventually I got to a point that I thought I’d give another marathon a go.So London 2009 it was. A hot day – too hot really – and I managed to complete the course. Just! But I didn’t achieve the time I’d targeted (sub 4 hours), missing it by a few minutes. That spurred me on and over the next eight or nine years I ran more marathons: in Edinburgh, Paris, Berlin and quite a few other spots. I even ran a couple of ultramarathons – but events low on the scale compared to those described by Murakami in this book. So back to the book. I’d read, and enjoyed, a couple of Murakami’s novels and spotting this one seemed prophetic in some way. The title is a play on Carver’s short story collection, What We Talk About When We Talk About Love (a book I also much enjoyed) and it’s a series of reflections about the author’s life but significantly the part running has played in it. And he was certainly a serious runner, competing well over 20 marathons and one-off events of up to 62 miles! His reflections are interesting, informative, thought provoking and, ultimately, inspiring. I really loved the accounts of his long, long runs but also the insight into the man himself – the deeper thoughts on what inspired him and what fed this obsession (I think distance running has to be an obsession). It’s really a truncated autobiography and as such it’s a wonderful read. I’d really urge anybody interested in the man to take a look at it."

Mada jeste i to. Jer, od sredine svojih tridesetih, Murakami trči, toliko posvećeno, ozbiljno i u dugačkim maratonskim i ultramaratonskim trkama da mora biti to. I, ako ste, kao autor teksta takođe u tridesetim,-četrdesetim i trčite, i imate posebno mesto na polici za Japanca, sasvim je dovoljno da je i to. I dovoljno su sređene, savršeno staloženo obrađene, složene i ispisane misli o trčanju da je i više dovoljno da je samo to. A nije.Ovo je veoma lična kolekcija zapisa velikog pisca koja bi pre stala među memoare, eseje, pa i delove autobiografije. I među tim zapisima kriju se najveće lepote ove knjige. Murakami koji drži džez klub, mahnito skuplja ploče, putuje, primećuje bizarne detalje oko sebe, živi na ribi i povrću i jednostavno piše o tome.Toliko sam puta pisao o njemu, uvek sa ljubavlju ali nikad sa nepodeljenim oduševljenjem. Uvek je nedostajalo ono nešto što je sprečavalo da mu knjige budu baš velike. Sad znam zašto. Mnogo trčanja. Krize u poslednjoj trećini trke. Izvlačenje na iskustvo i mišiće. Murakamijevo stvaralaštvo je dobro istrčan maraton. Ne više od toga. Ali za nekoga ko još nije prevalio više od 20km u cugu, i to je kao planina važno, nedostižno i veliko. Zato posebno mesto na polici. Uvek."

The ‘hurt’ part is an unavoidable reality, but whether or not you can stand anymore is up to the runner himself. This pretty much sums up the most important aspect of marathon running.” “You make do with what you have. As you age you learn even to be happy with what you have.” “It’s pretty thin, the wall separating healthy confidence and unhealthy Pride.” “It doesn't matter how old I get, but as long as I continue to live I'll always discover something new about myself.” “But in real life things don't go so smoothly.

That would be none other than our old friend Reality.” “My own individual, stubborn, uncooperative often self-centered nature that still doubts itself--that, when troubles occur, tries to find something funny, or something nearly funny, about the situation. I've carried this character around like an old suitcase, down a long, dusty path. I'm not carrying it because I like it. The contents are too heavy, and it looks crummy, fraying in spots. I've carried it with me because there was nothing else I was supposed to carry. Still, I guess I have grown attached to it. As you might expect.” “No matter how long you stand there examining yourself naked before a mirror, you’ll never see reflected what’s inside.”“The weather has been strange in Japan this summer. The Rainey season, which usually winds down in the beginning of July, continued until the end of the month. It rained so much I got sick of it. There were torrential rains in parts of the country and a lot of people died. They say it’s all because of Global Warming. Maybe it is and maybe it isn’t. Some experts claim it is, some claim it isn’t. There’s some proof that it is, some that it isn’t. But still people say that most of the problems the earth is facing are more or less due to Global Warming. When sales of apparel go down, when tons of drift wood wash up on the shore, when there are floods and droughts, when consumer prices go up—Most of the fault is ascribed to Global Warming. What the world needs is a set villain that people can point at and say, “It’s all your fault.” At any rate, due to this villain that can’t be dealt with, it went on raining and I could hardly practice biking at all during July. It’s not my fault, it’s that villain’s.” And this one, that also suits me“I’m the kind of person who likes to be by himself. To put a finer point on it, I’m the type of person who doesn’t find it painful to be alone. I find spending an hour or two every day running alone, not speaking to anyone, as well as four or five hours alone at my desk, to be neither difficult nor boring. I’ve had this tendency ever since I was young, when, given a choice, I much preferred reading books on my own or concentrating on listening to music over being with someone else. I could always think of things to do by myself.”"
69,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7597016-zen,Rating 4 out of 5,"As a non-runner, this is likely to be the one and only book I’ll ever read about running so it’s just as well it’s written by Murakami. This is my second read of it (yes really … non-runner) and it’s a lot less about writing than I remember it. Until he writes a memoir dedicated to an analysis of his life and his work though (if ever), barring discussing it in articles, this is probably the closest I’ll get. Reading this is proof positive that I’ll read anything written by this man, though I’d have had to draw the line if he’d been into steroid-free weight lifting or deep sea bass fishing. Truly, I would have. Having read this again, I’m jealous. This man is – cue capitals - DISCIPLINED … which is why he’s fit and has written a raft of novels, and I’m not/haven’t, and am surrounded by chocolate bars and empty word documents.Murakami opens his dual-focussed memoir in Hawaii in 2005. At the time, he’s involved in a number of projects, including translating Scott Fitzgerald’s Gatsby and the works of Raymond Carver. The title of this memoir pays homage to Carver, echoing one of his defining pieces of fiction,  What we Talk about When we Talk about Love. Once again, here we see Murakami’s trademark straight-forward writing style as he details his passion for running, and discusses how this discipline intersects with his dedication towards writing. As he says, he wrote this in order to determine just what running means to him, reminding me of Flannery O’Connor’s famous dictum, ‘I write to see what I have to say’. What emerges here are Murakami’s patterns of solitude – through running, by the act of writing – and this in itself sheds some light on his tendency towards often desolate characters in his fiction.  ""Sometimes, however, this sense of isolation, like acid spilling out of a bottle, can unconsciously eat away a person's heart and dissolve it. You could see it, too, as a kind of double-edged sword. It protects me, but at the same time steadily cuts away at me from the inside. I think in my own way I'm aware of this danger - probably through experience - and that's why I've had to constantly keep my body in motion, in some cases pushing myself to the limit, in order to heal the loneliness I feel inside ...""There are lengthy descriptions of the effects on his body, mind, and wider life, of participation in several major marathons, including, sadly, Boston. It also details his unwavering pragmatism:  'If I wanted to have a long life as a novelist, I needed to find a way to keep fit and maintain a healthy weight'.  God, he's so sensible. My Dad would have loved me to have brought this guy home.This is truly only a memoir for fans of him and his fiction, or running, though. If you happen to like both then you’ll have hit the jackpot.

Have always wondered how in his books Murakami brings in that intimacy, that dream-like quality that bypasses rationality where it is unnecessary, that acute vividness and heightened sense of impetus of the seemingly mundane and the supposedly unimportant. This book clearly showed how, in typical Murakami style, revealing only those aspects of his life that he wants the readers to know - free of any empty, vacuous motivational jargon and overblown hope - eloquent with the complete acceptance and commitment to the pain and loneliness of the hard yards.

Divided into 4 main parts it follows a string of events over 25 years of running, as well as personal sideline stories that affected or contributed to Murakami's successes or failures. He writes about his training and experience with a philosophical touch. His thoughts about running and processing life is often a mirror image of my own...coupled with his descriptive comparison to the endurance of writing novels, his thoughts are humbling and present a treat of a biography. I found many of my own thoughts and processes reflected in this amazing book. There are no words I could use to express my inner workings any better then he does. (Of course he can do this much better..., he is a writer!)A book written from the heart that illustrates the highs and lows of running, competing and aging gracefully, reflected by experience without pushing a message, but rather contributing philosophical points and views about the inner workings and evolution of Murakami's own being.

Прекарах живота си в правене н�� неща, които искам, по начин, който ми допада, независимо от всичко. Не промених подхода си дори когато ме възпираха или критикуваха злостно. Какво и от кого би могъл да поиска такъв човек?”След издадени повече от 15 романа Харуки Мураками повдига завесата на ума и сърцето си в автобиографичната си книга „За какво говоря, когато говоря за бягането”. Известен с желанието си да бъде сам и да не излага живота си на показ, близо 10 години Харуки описва ежедневието си, сравнявайки го с бягането. Това обаче не е типичната автобиография, това по-скоро са частични мемоари, засягащи зрялата възраст на Мураками. Изключвайки подробности от жизнения му път, в книгата си Харуки успява да предаде по най-деликатния и фин начин есенцията на живота си, излагайки пред читателите своите чувства, страхове и комплекси.Мураками заимства заглавието на книгата си от сборника с разкази на американския писател Реймънд Карвър - „За какво говорим, като говорим за любов”. Харуки обаче говори за бягането, за бягането като метафора на живота: колкото и банално да звучи за това, че човек никога трябва да спира, дори да го изпреварват; че светът безпогрешно се движи напред от поколение към поколение. Той сравнява живота със състезателната пътека, поставяйки като най-важно условие и на двете места: честната игра. „Даже да се наложи да пълзя, ще стигна до края”В „За какво говоря, когато говоря за бягането” прозира източната мъдрост на смирението, приемането на нещата, такива, каквито са и осъзнаването на това, колко малки и незначителни сме в цялата Вселена. Как инак да разбираме думите на един от най-влиятелните писатели, който сам се определя като „Нищо повече от отломка, изхвърлена на брега на океана”.Житейският път на Мураками е повече от впечатляващ. Израснал в семейство от средната класа, през целия си живот той се е борел сам. Работил е различни професии, отваря бар, който менажира сам и успява да разработи като печеливш бизнес, докато един ден не се посвещава на писането и то след като се вдъхновява за роман по време на футболен мач. Харуки се прибира вкъщи, пише първия си ръкопис и го изпраща на конкурс за млади таланти до 30 годишна възраст. Минават месеци и романът му излиза в Япония, печели дори критиката. Мураками решава, че писането му е призвание и затваря печелившото си заведение, за да се затвори вкъщи и да се отдаде на самотата и писането.„Откритите рани на сърцето са неизбежната цена, която трябва да платим на света за самостоятелността си”Освен писането обаче голяма страст на Мураками е спортът. Сякаш очевидно, той предпочита индивидуалните състезания, а не груповите. Всеки ден бяга, години наред, по 10 километра, в усамотение, под глухия звук от стъпките и в ритъма на любимия си рок, бяга в празното, бяга в себе си и към себе си. Час-два от разноликото, невинаги уютно и ласкаво ежедневие, посветени на джогинг за тялото, духа и ума. И всяка година участва �� поне един маратон, упорито, съсредоточено, неизменно устремен към финала. „В писателската професия, поне за мен, няма състезание. Може би тиражите, литературните награди, ласкавите или негативни отзиви мога да послужат за ориентир, но не бих казал, че са съществен проблем. Главното е дали създаденото покрива стандартите, които са съм си поставил, и оправданията не важат. Все някак ще измисля оправдание за пред другите. Не съм в състояние обаче да измамя сърцето си. В този смисъл писането на романи прилича на маратонското бягане. В основата стои необходимостта авторът да носи мотивацията вътре в себе си, тихо и твърдо, а не да търси външни потвърждения и критерии. По-същественото е да преодолея, макар и малко, вчерашния си Аз. Понеже ако има съперник в бягането на дълги разстояния, това всъщност е предишния ми Аз.”Философията на Мураками е подчинена на смирението, приемането на естествения ход на нещата и пълноценно изживеният живот. Харуки вярва, че годините изживени пълнокръвно, с ясна цел, са далеч по-добри от времето, прекарано как да е. Безкомпромисно критичен към себе си той приема процеса на остаряването на тялото си, но не пропуска да окачестви състоянието си като „жалко” и „нескопосано”.„Светът е пълен с неизброимо количество неща, които не са ми по силите, и със съперници, които не мога да победя, въпреки всичките си опити. Свикнал съм да губя.”Роден през 1949 г. в Киото. Впоследствие семейството му се преселва в Кобе, където се пробужда интересът му към чуждестранната литература. Завършва успешно литературния факултет на токийския университет, а по-късно става съдържател на джазклуб в Шибоя. Като студент взема участие в антивоенното движение и се обявява срещу войната във Виетнам. Прекарва три години в Гърция и Италия, след което се установява в Принстаун и в продължение на четири години преподава в местния университет. През 1995 г., след земетресението в Кобе и атентата в токийското метро, решава да се завърне в Япония.Още първата му книга „Чуй как пее вятърът“ (1979) е отличена с престижна награда. Сам той признава, че е повлиян не толкова от японските литературни кодове, колкото от попкултурата, която му е открила прозорец към света. Преводач е на Чандлър, Фицджералд и други големи американски автори, които иска да открие за японската култура. Харуки Мураками е признат от световната литературна критика за един от най-добрите съвременни японски автори. Той със сигурност e най-превежданият в чужбина и с най-високи тиражи на книгите си, издавани и преиздавани многократно не само в САЩ и Западна Европа, но и в Русия, Румъния, Сърбия и пр. Творчеството му е изпълнено с поезия и ониризъм, което обяснява факта, че всяка от книгите му се продава в повече от 2 000 000 екземпляра."

 ""Thực ra, ý tôi là tôi không bắt đầu chạy bộ vì ai đó bảo tôi nên chạy bộ. Cũng như tôi không trở thành tiểu thuyết gia vì ai đó yêu cầu tôi phải làm thế. Một hôm, bất ngờ, tôi muốn viết một cuốn tiểu thuyết. Và một hôm, đột ngột, tôi bắt đầu chạy - đơn giản vì tôi muốn thế. Tôi luôn làm bất cứ thứ gì mình cảm thấy thích làm trong đời. Người ta có thể cố ngăn tôi, và làm cho tôi thấy là tôi sai, nhưng tôi sẽ không thay đổi.""
Tôi Nói Gì Khi Nói Về Chạy Bộ là cuốn tự truyện của Haruki Murakami kể về quá trình ông chạy bộ và cả những suy nghĩ, những chiêm nghiệm của Murakami về việc chạy bộ có ích như thế nào trong cuộc đời làm nghề tiểu thuyết gia của ông. Về việc khi đã bắt tay vào viết tiểu thuyết thì cần phải trung thành với đứa con tinh thần của mình đến mức nào. Và cả việc chạy bộ hóa ra cũng có liên quan đến sự nghiệp viết văn của Haruki Murakami nữa.Trong cuốn tự truyện này tớ cũng biết thêm được rất nhiều về con người của bác già - rằng Murakami không chỉ là một người viết văn mà ông còn là một người chạy kiên nhẫn, chịu khó và là một người có tính kỷ luật cực kỳ khắt khe. Nhiều khi đọc thấy thực sự cảm phục ý chí thể dục thể thao nâng cao sức khỏe của bác già với thành tích chạy bộ cực kỳ khủng. Murakami cực kỳ nghiêm khắc với chính bản thân mình trong việc luyện tập, ông tham dự 24 cuộc thi chạy marathon, luyện tập đến đau đớn thể xác nhưng nhất quyết không bỏ cuộc, luôn tìm cách tốt nhất để cho cơ thể mình thích nghi được với cường độ chạy mỗi ngày, làm sao để cho chính bản thân mình luôn được hài lòng. Có thể thành tích ấy không là nhất, nhưng quan trọng là bác già đã mãn nguyện với mục tiêu của riêng mình.
Thời gian chạy của tôi, thứ hạng tôi đạt được, vẻ ngoài của tôi - tất cả những thứ đó đều là thứ yếu. Đối với một người chạy như tôi, điều thực sự quan trọng là đạt được mục đích chính mình đặt ra, trong khả năng của mình. Tôi dốc hết sức mình, chịu đựng cái cần chịu đựng, và tôi có thể, theo cách riêng của mình, mãn nguyện.
Bên cạnh đó qua cuốn tự truyện của Murakami, tớ cũng thực sự ấn tượng với những suy nghĩ dám nghĩ dám làm của tác giả, khởi nghiệp với một câu lạc bộ nhạc jazz nhưng lại dám dẹp hết sang một bên để tập trung viết tiểu thuyết chỉ vì 
""Tôi chỉ có cái mong muốn mãnh liệt là viết một cuốn tiểu thuyết.""
 Và thế là tác phẩm đầu tay Lắng Nghe Gió Hát của bác già ra đời. Một điểm sáng nữa của cuốn tự truyện này đó là nó thực sự truyền cho tớ cảm hứng làm việc hay học tập, nhất là hiểu được tầm quan trọng của việc tham gia thể thao rất cần thiết vì nó không chỉ giúp chúng ta có một cư thể khỏe mạnh, mà còn rèn luyện được sự bền bỉ, nhẫn nại và sức khỏe tốt chắc chắn sẽ làm tăng năng suất hiệu quả trong công việc của ta hơn.
""Tôi không hề chịu nổi nếu bị buộc phải làm điều gì đó tôi không muốn làm vào lúc tôi không muốn làm. Thế nhưng mỗi khi tôi có thể làm gì đấy mà tôi thích làm, khi tôi muốn làm, và theo cách tôi muốn làm, thì tôi sẽ làm hết sức mình.""
Câu ""triết lý"" trên của bác già là câu mà tớ thích nhất và chắc chắn không phải lời nói suông vì Murakami đã chứng minh được sở thích ấy của mình trong suốt hơn mấy chục năm qua. Murakami chạy vì ông thích thế, một ngày nắng đẹp khi đang xem hai đội bóng thi đấu, thế là nổi hứng viết luôn tiểu thuyết đầu tay vì ông thích thế. Nhưng mỗi khi làm một việc gì, cả chạy hay viết thì Murakami luôn dành trọn vẹn tâm trí và công sức của mình cho việc đó. Đấy cũng chính là điều làm tớ càng hâm mộ và quý trọng bác già. Nhìn chung, Tôi Nói Gì Khi Nói Về Chạy Bộ không phải là fiction mà là một memoir, tự truyện về chính một phần nhỏ trong cuộc đời của Haruki Murakami. Nhiều câu văn cực kì truyền cảm hứng cho tớ nói riêng, không chỉ là về vấn đề chạy bộ hay viết văn mà còn ứng dụng được kha khá trong cuộc sống. Mà thôi, cứ Murakami là auto mua về đọc không suy nghĩ, recommend nhá."

I don't do marathons (or triathlons) but I agree with and believe in so much of what this guy is talking about. He treats running as both an activity and as a metaphor-as a place to literally execute his commitment to improvement and hard work in the form of a little bit further or a little bit faster. Because if you can do it there, when no one is watching and it doesn't count, than you can sure do it for the rest of your life.This is actually something Tim Ferriss has been talking about, which is that you need some sort of physically activity in your life so that it function as a steady drip of excellence: your company may be having financial troubles but you just beat your mile time or maxed our your deadlift. This book is kind of a diary of one man (a enormously successful novelist) who has done and is doing that. It's got good examples of how to talk to your body-rather, how to kick it around-and how to motivate yourself and appreciate solitude. Again, it's very short but very poetic and worth reading."

Čini mi se nekako nepravedno, sve ostale su četvorke i dve trojke.Uz svaku njegovu knjigu uživam, to nije sporno. Lepo ga je čitati. Ipak, svaka je napisana nekako skromno, bez blještavila i vatrometa. A takav je očigledno i Haruki kao čovek, ne samo kao pisac. Ova njegova kombinacija memoara i eseja o trčanju ga opisuje takvim, njegov pristup životu, hobiju i poslu.Ja ne trčim, više volim ekipne sportove. Pravo govoreći, volim samo košarku, i to je jedan od razloga što mi se ova knjiga svidela. Iako opisuje nešto što mu je hobi, piše o tome sa toliko strasti, sa kakvom o sportu verovatno mogu govoriti samo oni koji ga upražnjavaju iz ljubavi. Razmišljanja o trčanju ispresecana su i njegovom životnom filozofijom i pogledom na život, kao i objašnjenjem o tome kako i zašto piše. Da skratim - ne morate biti trkač da bi uživali u ovoj knjizi."

Ο,τι κι αν εχω διαβάσει μου ερχόταν να πω στον συγγραφέα ""έλα, πως και δεν το σκέφτηκα;""Ωστόσο αυτό το memoir θα μπορούσα να το χαρακτηρίσω την καλύτερη δυνατή μορφή βιβλίου αυτοβελτίωσης, χωρίς να έχει σκοπό να γίνει τέτοιο. Δεν έχει σημασία αν σου αρέσει το τρέξιμο. Προσωπικά έχω να τρέξω από το σχολείο που μας βάζανε να κάνουμε το γύρο του προαυλίου. Στην θέση όμως του τρεξίματος, μπορείτε να βάλετε κάθε πρόκληση που βάζετε στοίχημα με τον εαυτό σας ότι θα καταφέρετε.

Χρειάζεται να μείνεις συνεπής απέναντι στον εαυτό σου για το τι είναι αυτό που σε ευχαριστεί και να προσπαθείς στο μέτρο που μπορείς. Αν προσθέσεις οτι και ο Μουρακάμι έχει έναν μοναδικό τρόπο να μιλάει ακόμα και για το τρέξιμο, έχεις τελικά ένα πολύ ευχάριστό ανάγνωσμα.

85,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2156200-k-d-absolutely,Rating 2 out of 5,"I bought this book almost two years ago after reading Haruki Murakami's Kafka on the Shore (4 stars) and The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle (4 stars). I liked those novels a lot so I purchased and read most of his other books right away like Sputnik Sweetheart (3 stars), After Dark (4 stars), Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman (3 stars), After the Quake (1 star - this used to be 3 stars until I saw my brother's review) and even his biography, Haruki Murakami and the Music of Words (3 stars). A couple of months back, I read his most challenging-to-read novel, Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World and it was just okay, 2 stars. I think the more books of him I read, the less I like him. Those first 3 books of him that I read were really good. His style of writing was very different and his imagination was overwhelmingly beautiful. However, as I read his other books, even though I gave enough distance in between two books, I got tired of his style so the stories just felt ordinary. He had the tendency to re-use his materials: characters, plot, conflict, setting, etc. There were just obvious similarities that were just hard to ignore. This is my 8th book by Haruki Murakami and this makes him one of my two most-read authors. He's now tied with Bob Ong, a Filipino writer whose works I read not because I like him but because many young Filipinos adore him and keep on talking about his books in our group here in Goodreads.What I Talk About When I Talk About Running is his only memoir (so far). My first non-fiction of him. It is about his hobby, running that he tried to compare with writing a novel. The memoir tells so little about his life like how he became a novelist and only mentioned his wife in a couple of anecdotes. The narration was fragmentary as he said in the epilogue that it took him four years to write his thoughts and so he just collated everything and presto, this book. He used so many words but for me his main message was: Even if I am already old, I run because I want to keep fit so I can continue writing great novels. It was as simple as that. The thing is we all do that. We take care of ourselves so that we can continue earning and provide for our family. So, the book came to me as bragging, self-serving, presumptuous and stating the obvious. Haruki Murakami was born in 1949 so he was 51-55 y/o (this year he is now 62) when he was writing entries to this memoir and he was telling here about his training for triathlon (swimming, biking and running). So when, he was describing here that he was experiencing all sorts of pains and injuries while barely mentioning about getting old and seeing doctors, my brain was shouting: 
""You are already old, stop being hard on yourself!""
. Bottomline, I think he was trying to hold back the hands of time. He was a late-bloomer as he only thought of writing when he was 30. He was not comfortable about getting old so he wanted to prove that he could still compete with much younger men. I am so sorry for him. It's just so pathetic. But still, it was hard for me to give this a lone star (I didn't like it!). Haruki Murakami's narration was still as beautiful as ever."
86,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/957634-daniel-clausen,Rating 4 out of 5,"Everything I learned about writing, I learned by running...so writes Haruki Murakami. This was the second time I read this book, but I read it three different ways this time. I bought a used Japanese edition. I read it paragraph by paragraph alongside the English edition. I read it by running. If I were truly to understand this book’s meaning this time around, I would need to run. I set a timer for 20 minutes and ran every other day. That doesn’t sound like a long time, especially when you consider that Murakami ran an ultramarathon, but for me it hurt like hell. I proofread my novel-in-progress in a similar manner to the way I ran. I set a 10 minute timer and proofread the book in two 10-minute stretches every day. What am I training for? I’m training for the marathon that is my life. I want to be thinner. I want to be more disciplined. And I want a novel that is long and lean and built to last like a marathon runner. Perhaps the only way to do that is to run every day...to read every day...to proofread every day...to revise every day...but most importantly to hurt every day. "

89,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27599745-srividya-vijapure,Rating 3 out of 5,"I selected this book from the library simply because it was one of the few books that were readily available. Being a Murakami book, I thought that it would definitely be a nice read and so I borrowed it. Little did I know that this small book packed a punch within its covers, whose pages were bursting with some wonderful philosophies and some really interesting insights into Murakami’s mind and thought process.What I talk about when I talk about running – The title itself is interesting and pleads with you to ask that question of yourself, even if you aren’t a habitual runner. Okay confession time – I don’t run, not that I hate running or anything but that I am one lazy person, a couch potato who likes her books more than anything. And despite that, I put this question to myself, or rather worded it differently and said what I talk about when I talk about doing something mechanical. Runners in this forum do not take up your sword against me, I am not calling running a mechanical activity but am simply saying that doing something mechanical is the only thing I do differently from reading, and you have to accept that reading is not a mechanical chore but a pleasant ride into the infinity. Anyway, coming back to the question that I had put to myself, the only answer that was possible was that – I thought of NOTHING, no thoughts, zilch!! It was as if my mind decides to take a break and disappear when I do something mechanical so that there is a void or rather a semblance of a void. Intrigued by my own reaction, I decided to see whether Murakami agreed or disagreed with me and I am really happy to say that he did agree, in a fashion! Oh don’t worry that is not a spoiler, in fact this is one book that I can review happily without ever giving any spoilers for the review will mostly be subjective, being my interpretation, which as you know will differ for different people. Coming back to the book, Murakami adopts a very different style for this one, given that it is part autobiographical, being a memoir of sorts where he links his running and writing and how the two do meet at times and yet differ at times. This book is inspiring, full of quotes that make you nod your head and say that yes I have experienced that or I know what that feels like or that I can empathise because I have seen it happen to others. Whatever your scenario, Murakami writes to the reader and the reader, at least this reader, connected to it really well and we became thick friends in this small passage of time. Here's a sample;

“Don’t misunderstand me – I’m not totally uncompetitive. It’s just that for some reason I never care all that much whether I beat others or lost to them. This sentiment pretty much remained unchanged after I grew up. It doesn’t matter what field you are talking about – beating somebody else just doesn’t do it for me. I’m much more interested in whether I reach the goals that I set for myself…”

His prose is self-deprecating, funny and motivating, whilst also resonating some anguish, not at failing but at being unable to find the reason for that failure. I loved it for different reasons, one being that it spoke to me;

“Life is basically unfair. But even in a situation that’s unfair, I think it’s possible to seek out a kind of fairness. Of course, that might take time and effort. And maybe it won’t seem to be worth all that. It’s up to each individual to decide whether or not it is.”

There is all this and more in this book but the beauty lies not in its inspiring message but in the fact that Murakami does not preach at any point in this book. All the statements made by him or epiphanies that occurred to him are all just jotted down as mere observations. In the beginning of the book, he clearly says that this is not a book to motivate others to take up long distance running but if someone chooses to do so and finds it enjoyable then it is like a cherry on an existing cake.I found this short book interesting and I have to say that inspired me to stop being a couch potato. Of course, like Murakami says, unless that change comes from within, it won’t last. Whether I will continue in my effort to staying fit is a topic for another day, today however, I feel that Murakami definitely ruled the roost with this small yet captivating book. Do read it, if you can, it isn’t great literature but it is definitely something that all of us will relate to in some way or the other!"
90,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30279227-ts-chan,Rating 4 out of 5,"Most runners run not because they want to live longer, but because they want to live life to the fullest. If you’re going to while away the years, it’s far better to live them with clear goals and fully alive than in a fog, and I believe running helps you do that. Exerting yourself to the fullest within your individual limits; that’s the essence of running, and a metaphor for life - and for me, for writing as well. I believe many runners would agree.And wholeheartedly so! While quite a few family members and friends of mine have read Murakami’s novels, I have not gotten onto that train yet. This memoir, however, intrigued me and given that it is relatively short I felt that it will not take me away from my planned reading too much. The book in itself is very simple. Sometimes the writing comes across as almost elementary for a novelist of his renown, but it could be due to the translation or because it is written like journal entries, albeit with more eloquence than most of us can fashion. As a novelist who runs, he equated the challenges of writing closely to that of running and how the discipline of being a long-distance runner translated across to that of writing. I am not a writer but little did I realize how much I’d identify with Murakami’s memoir about running, writing and to a lesser extent, ageing. And it inspires me enough to round out my review of his book by facing the question of “What running means to me?”And it is not a simple answer. By some sheer coincidence, I started running at the same age that Murakami did, i.e. thirty-three. Although I was no couch potato, running was not something that I’d enjoyed. Something changed, however, when I decided to participate in my first ever 10km race in Singapore’s flagship event which was headline sponsored by the bank I worked for (still am working for actually). There is a very strong sense of community which is almost tribal amongst runners. The bonds that one forms with fellow runners whom you may not know transcend all boundaries when you are out there giving it your all. There are tonnes of stories and viral videos of runners helping strangers who are struggling to the finish line. We even see this sometimes in a competitive pro event. Personally, the closest friends that I have to-date are those whom I have met or fostered friendships through running. On an even more personal level, the contest of running is all within oneself. There’s no one across the net from you that you are trying to beat (I used to play tennis before I started running). The only one you are trying to beat is yourself and your own perceived limits, both physical and mental. Each and every year since I’ve started running, I’ve set a personal goal for myself - from running a 10k to a half marathon and eventually a full marathon. Then I started on triathlons as well (just like Murakami too), from a mini one to sprint and then the Olympic distance. After that, my goal is to beat my PB (ie. personal best) for the same distances that I have achieved. And when people ask me why I keep setting myself these goals every year, I tell them that most of us who work as an employee, the work that we do seldom make enough of a difference that you can claim a legacy that is yours. However, these personal goals, if I do meet them, are mine and mine alone. I am a barely mediocre runner and this is not me trying to be modest. But I do what I want to do and it's my personal achievement within the challenged limits of my body and mind. And that is what I talk about when I talk about running."

I enjoy running now and again but I wouldn't term myself a runner. And ordinarily I wouldn't pick up books that are classified in the 'sport - non-fiction' genre - I didn't even know that was a genre but hey, that's what it is on the back of my copy! But Murakami doesn't just write about running, he also talks about writing and his life and I find him endlessly fascinating even when he is talking about what could be a very bland subject.I loved charting Murakami's progress towards his various marathons, his description of running an ultra-marathon, and also the variety of places he had travelled to both to run and write. He made me want to pick up a pen and start writing again. He made me want to lace up my running shoes and hit the pavement, no matter how unfit I currently am. He made me want to appreciate the little things and develop my own life routines. He made me not feel bad about sometimes just being happy to be on my own.This isn't a perfect book by any means, but it's what I needed at the time, and I would recommend it to anyone who has an interest in either running, writing, or just memoir in general."

Of course, it's nice to be praised like this. A lot better than being disparaged, that's for sure. But I don't think it's merely willpower that makes you able to do something. The world isn't that simple. To tell the truth, I don't even think there's that much correlation between my running every day and whether or not I have a strong will. I think I've been able to run for more than twenty years for a simple reason: It suits me."

Best run I ever did done. And I would do again today if I wasn't achey :DThis was thanks to Murakami's running mania. He also gave me permission not to think about anything in particular and listen to mediocre music. Before, my head sounded like that anxious stream that visits you at night if you've forgotten to place a notepad on your nightstand. But the running is strenuous enough without all that mental exhaustion also.IDK who I'd recommend this to, though- if you come here looking for Murakami, you'll be disappointed. (Omg that other non-fiction of his, Underground, was so tedious!)But now I have hope I'll be one of those weird guys who reaches his prime in his 50s and writes like 100 novels a year by dictating them while running ultramarathons. Like Eddie Izzard.I just need the right pair of heels."
94,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53037-maryam,Rating 4 out of 5,"I picked this book as part of my Read Harder Challenge and I liked it despite being repetitive in so many parts. What we have here is a daily memoir of Murakami’s running and the marathons he participated in. I’m a fan of Murakami’s work and this books wasn’t any different.I liked the fact that he put whatever was on his mind, of course I might be wrong but at least it seems like that to me. He’s written down struggles, mental or physicals that he faced when preparing or even running for a marathon.The concepts he has in this book can apply to different aspects of life. He speaks of running and marathons but I can think of infinite situations that I thought I’m ready enough to face and pass them but when happened I realized I was wrong. Even sometimes it’s not about how prepared you are but just the simple fact that you don’t have what is needed and you cannot have it… it’s just knowing your limits and your potentials.That was my impression of this book."

101,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43326703-blackjessamine,Rating 4 out of 5,"Sono una persona che ha una profonda ed appassionata relazione con il proprio divano: tutte quelle attività che comportano della fatica fisica, il sudore, lo spingersi almeno un pochino oltre il proprio punto di massimo sforzo non hanno mai fatto per me; mi sento goffa, mi sento scoppiare il cuore dopo un paio di rampe di scale, la mia costanza e determinazione sono pari a zero. Non impazzisco per Murakami, ho apprezzato qualcosa di suo, ma gli ultimi approcci mi hanno a dire il vero piuttosto irritata.Dunque, verrebbe da chiedersi, a che pro leggere un saggio su un argomento lontanissimo da me scritto da un autore che non adoro? Be', perché Murakami è diventato una sorta di porto sicuro. Non mi fa impazzire, eppure so esattamente cosa aspettarmi dai suoi libri, e leggerlo mi dà un senso di sicurezza: so che nei suoi libri troverò diverse cose che non mi piaceranno, so che mi lamenterò sempre delle stesse cose, ma non posso fare a meno di leggere almeno un Murakami all'anno.E poi c'è la corsa. Ebbene, un paio d'anni fa mi sono ritrovata a cercare di andare a vedere una mostra alla Triennale di Milano, senza avere la minima idea che sarei stata bloccata dalle transenne della Stramilano. Mentre me ne stavo lì a cercare di raccapezzarmi su come fare per attraversare quella maledetta strada, ho cominciato a guardarmi attorno, ed ho imparato alcune cose: ho imparato che c'è gente che partecipa alle corse solo per il gusto di fare pipì davanti a chiunque, senza nemmeno cercare di nascondersi, e anzi, sorridendo allegramente a chiunque abbia la fortuna di incrociare il suo sguardo; ho imparato che durante le corse (o forse, spero, è solo questa ad avere un problemino di organizzazione) si spreca una grandissima quantità di acqua e di plastica, perché lungo il percorso ci sono punti di ristoro pieni di bottigliette d'acqua da cui gli atleti bevono qualche sorso, per poi buttarle come se niente fosse a terra; infine, ho imparato che lungo tutto il percorso di una corsa ci sono persone che non fanno altro che lanciare grida di incoraggiamento ai corridori, a tutti, e ho imparato che ci sono pochissime cose al mondo in grado di commuovermi in maniera così totale e rapida quanto delle persone che compiono un grande sforzo fisico circondate da altre persone che, incessantemente, le incoraggiano. Ecco, questa valanga di parole per dire che, forse, ""L'arte di correre"" non è poi un libro così tanto lontano da me. Perché Murakami parla di corsa, ma non vuole scrivere né un manuale per corridori principianti, né un libro che ogni due pagine grida ""hey, alza il sedere e scendi in strada a correre!"". Perché Murakami parla di corsa e di scrittura, parla dei suoi libri, lo fa con la voce che ho imparato a riconoscere come familiare, ma senza tutti quegli elementi che mi fanno avvertire come irritante la lettura dei suoi libri.""L'arte di correre"" è un insieme poco organico di ricordi sparsi, aneddoti, riflessioni sulla vita di Murakami, la scrittura e la corsa. Non ha uno scopo preciso, non è particolarmente esauriente, ma probabilmente l'ho apprezzato proprio per questo: Murakami si ritaglia del tempo fra i vari impegni giornalieri per liberarsi di pensieri e riflessioni, senza direttive o progetti di organicità, e da questi pensieri sparsi emerge un libro che si può leggere a spizzichi e bocconi, senza avere un particolare interesse né per Murakami, né per la corsa.Mi è molto piaciuto, in qualche modo mi ha, posso dir, consolato questo parallelo fra la scrittura di un romanzo e il correre una maratona: per fare entrambe le cose serve concentrazione, serve perseveranza, dedizione, sforzo, esercizio costante; certo una naturale predisposizione serve, ma è rincuorante pensare che la concentrazione sia esattamente come un muscolo. Ed è terribilmente rincuorante sapere che è esistito un uomo che un giorno era un barista sovrappeso che fumava diversi pacchetti di sigarette, ed il giorno dopo è riuscito a diventare scrittore di professione e maratoneta. Soprattutto perché Murakami non si presenta mai come un superuomo, un eroe, qualcuno che stato capace di compiere un gesto straordinario: Murakami resta un uomo con mille difetti, riconosce di essere antipatico a molti, ammette le sue debolezze e i suoi errori, parla del ""runner blues"" e di tutte le birre ghiacciate che lo hanno tormentato a partire dal trentacinquesimo chilometro.È ovvio, dopo questo libro non scriverò certamente un romanzo, né mi alzerò ogni mattina alle cinque per andare a correre, però mi resteranno bene impresse nella mente delle immagini piccole ma preziose, come la coda di cavallo bionda di una studentessa di Harvard, la sensazione di non saper respirare mentre tutti attorno si affannano a nuotare, o il gesto semplice di un vecchino a Maratona che toglie un mazzolino di fiori dal loro vaso per porgerli ad un uomo che ha contato i corpi degli animali lungo una statale."

103,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10651001-jaclyn,Rating 4 out of 5,"How do you talk about the things that you love, the things that make you who you are?You talk about them like this. Murakami dives into his passion for running and intermingles it with his success as a writer. With this work Murakami manages to hone in on two cross sections of society: writers & athletes. Both people that love to run, and those who love to read, can find value in this work. Even readers that don't enjoy running can gain knowledge from reading this work. This is a work that shows the importance of exercising the mind, body and spirit.What I Talk About When I Talk About Running is a memoir. The writing style is simple and conversational. Murakami wrote many of these chapters as journal entries while training for marathons. It is deeply introspective, and inspires introspection on the part of the reader. There is a lot to be gleaned about the author and ourselves from reading this.Far from being preachy, Murakami simply talks about his own experiences and goals. This is a beneficial work to read if you are looking to make a change and achieve a goal.“People sometimes sneer at those who run every day, claiming they’ll go to any length to live longer. But I don’t think that’s the reason most people run. Most runners run not because they want to live longer, but because they want to live life to the fullest. If you’re going to while away the years, it’s far better to live them with clear goals and fully alive than in a fog, and I believe running helps you do that. Exerting yourself to the fullest within your individual limits: that’s the essence of running, and a metaphor for life—and for me, for writing as well. I believe many runners would agree.”Despite being nonfiction, there are still signs of Murakami's classic speculative style. Many sentences brought me back to The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, my chosen favorite novel of Murakami's. Even for those fans of Murakami not interested in running and writing can enjoy this story for moments like these.“I look up at the sky, wondering if I'll catch a glimpse of kindness there, but I don't. All I see are indifferent summer clouds drifting over the Pacific. And they have nothing to say to me. Clouds are always taciturn. I probably shouldn't be looking up at them. What I should be looking at is inside of me. Like staring down into a deep well. Can I see kindness there? No, all I see is my own nature. My own individual, stubborn, uncooperative often self-centered nature that still doubts itself--that, when troubles occur, tries to find something funny, or something nearly funny, about the situation. I've carried this character around like an old suitcase, down a long, dusty path. I'm not carrying it because I like it. The contents are too heavy, and it looks crummy, fraying in spots. I've carried it with me because there was nothing else I was supposed to carry. Still, I guess I have grown attached to it. As you might expect.”I also think this work humanizes him. Murakami is popular abroad, but he was HUGELY popular in Japan. There are countless accounts of him being mobbed at airports, harassed on the streets, etc, to the point where he left Japan to live abroad. This work shows another side of Murakami that readers may not see: He's more than just the man behind the page, he's a human with human interests and aspirations outside of authorship."

Non-fiction của Murakami cơ bản là chán. Lần này, do thay đổi mục tiêu, không phải vì văn chương mà là self-help nên cố thử xem sao. Dù nhiều lúc muốn bóp chết các nam chính của Murakami (mà có lẽ chính là Murakami) cũng như thằng nào có tính tương tự nhưng tôi vẫn phải thừa nhận cơ bản mình giống họ và lối sống của Murakami gần giống với quy trình lý tưởng mà tôi đóng khung treo trong phòng.Bắt đầu đọc thì vẫn chán thật :( Và kỳ vọng thì rất thấp là để giảm cân =)) Hai năm bê tha đã lên 5kg. Quần có cái phải mặc size M :( Vài tháng gần đây trở lại fruitarianism và work out nhẹ thì đã là 84-63-92. Kể ra cũng tạm hài lòng nhưng tạm hài lòng là một trạng thái cực nguy hiểm và mục tiêu là phải về size XS dù ai nói ngả nói nghiêng. Quả thật là sách rất self help luôn vì mai về nhà sẽ đi căn chỉnh xe đạp và trở lại với cung đường núi đi hái hồng vào mùa thu hihiSau nữa là thời gian biểu của Murakami cơ bản là trùng khớp với tôi. Tôi làm việc ở nhà và thiền sinh thì cần dậy trước 5h và ngủ trước 22h. T��t nhiên cả đời tôi chắc sống được vậy một tháng =)) Nay đọc để thêm động lực sống đúng chuẩn 😉)Từ trải nghiệm cá nhân tôi cũng hiểu rằng sự thay đổi về lượng dẫn tới sự thay đổi về chất và sự thay đổi về thể chất có tác động rất lớn với tinh thần. Tôi chỉ không ngờ là mặt tinh thần của cuốn sách này lại đáng kể như vậy =)) Nếu riêng vấn đề thể chất thì chỉ rate cuốn này 3* tức là self help được lắm nhưng từ đoạn siêu marathon đã nâng lên 5* 😉) Nếu tôi nói tính cách mình giống Murakami thì chắc nhiều người sẽ phì cười nhưng quả thật tôi đã đọc cuốn sách như một trò chuyện tương thông tinh thần. 70% con người tôi y chang: thích ở một mình, các hoạt động thể chất đều một mình, sợ giao tiếp, sống bản năng nhưng lì lợm và quyết đoán. 30% thì khác thật: trong khi Murakami tự tin với bản chất đó thì tôi rất sợ hãi loài người nên nếu là người lạ, họ rất dễ nghĩ tôi là người cực hướng ngoại, nói nhiều, tự tin và cơ bản là đáng sợ. Mỗi lần phải giao tiếp với thế giới, tôi đều kiệt sức vì phải diễn. Nhưng thật ra trong 30% đó cũng có cái thuộc về bản chất lửa thật =)) Là lửa nên nhiều khi tôi ghét chính bản thân và ghét đứa nào như Murakami. Anw đọc sách xong cảm thấy trung hòa được đôi phần. Nhưng cuộc sống của tôi chỉ đang ở ngưỡng 70% của cuốn sách, tức là giai đoạn hậu siêu marathon. Khi đọc phần này, tôi cứ cười mãi. Tôi hoàn toàn có thể viết một bản về mình song song với cuốn này. Cái cảm giác vượt ngưỡng đó tôi đã trải qua dứt khoát hai lần: sau khi nhịn đói bảy ngày và sau thời gian tu miên mật. Lần thứ ba, nhưng chưa hoàn tất, chính là hai năm vừa qua. Nó mới đang ở giai đoạn 70% là nỗi buồn của người thấy mình đang move on. That it hurts like so… Nhưng 30% còn lại của cuốn sách cho tôi tin rồi sẽ ra sao. Thú thật là cuốn sách này hoàn toàn không có gì mới. Tất cả những kết luận của Murakami tôi đều đã nghe rồi. Nhưng văn học khác sách self help thông thường là ở đó: sự truyền tải. Sau rốt thì, mở đầu chán nhưng càng đọc càng hào hứng. Murakami luôn có kiểu viết rất dễ chịu. Đặc biệt, tự truyện mà không đánh bóng cũng không ra vẻ khiêm nhường. Tôi tin là ông ấy nói thật. So cute"

108,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/113319695-chloe-kian,Rating 4 out of 5,First book I read from Murakami and it just is unlike anything I’ve ever read. Loved how it was simply yet beautifully written. As a runner and former triathlete myself I could relate with some of the stories he shared. It made me laugh at times and also reignited my desire to run more consistently again. 
109,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6909470-helle,Rating 4 out of 5,"(3.5 stars) My timing is about as wrong as it can be when it comes to reading a motivational book about running in the month of November. After all, I live in Scandinavia – not in the darkest corners of it perhaps, but still. As a Danish poet once said, there are 15 months to a year, 3 of which are November, November, November. Trying to sustain a modicum of motivation is thus an effort worthy of Sisyphus and other masochists. When, at regular intervals during the book, Murakami would complain about a spot of rain that prevented him from running, I could but laugh derisively. The book is a memoir of sorts – Murakami himself calls it a memoir – but 9/10 of it is about running, the last 1/10 dealing with writing, triathlon, moving country, collecting records and a sentence or three about his wife. This is a book for people who are either really into running or really into Murakami. Most of the book is written in a chatty, mundane style. It’s honest but also somewhat repetitive. We hear a lot about his running results, his goals for his next marathon, his decision to supplement his running with triathlons. Some of it is quite fascinating, such as his first marathon – which he ran from Athens to the town of Marathon 42 kilometers away – without it being a proper race but merely because he was writing an article about it and wasn’t prepared to cheat. At the end of this run he finally drinks the beer that he’d been dreaming of during the last 12 kilometers, and although he enjoyed it, it wasn’t as good as he’d expected:Nothing in the world can compare to the fantasies of a person who has lost consciousness.*This paves the way for the extreme focus that Murakami has: his ability to push himself in his running has enabled him to push his limits when it comes to his writing as well (though how is a bit unclear). This is a man who has run 10 kilometers a day for about 25 years. And he’s already decided what he wants written on his tombstone: At least he never walked. Talk about single-mindedness. He got a bit carried away here and there when it came to telling us about how fit he was or about the minutiae of his training. A quote comes to mind:The barrier between healthy confidence and unhealthy conceit is very thin.He stays on the right side of this, but the details became slightly tedious. Then again the book isn’t very long so it was not a major problem, and after all, I’m not a long distance runner, preferring the shorter (urban) distances (when I run at all, cf. the Scandinavian weather/darkness). He often spices up accounts of his training with philosophizing, which I enjoyed. (I also made a note of the fact that he, at the time of running the New York City marathon (for the 3rd or 4th time, I think), bought new Mizuno running shoes, which – as it happened – were the shoes I used to run in, the first pair of which I bought in New York). He owns up to his life not being spectacular (outside of his writing, I would venture). He imagines - but doesn’t particularly like – the idea of his life made into a movie. The director would say something like: ‘can we leave out that scene? It’s not bad but it’s nothing special’ – Murakami’s point being that most of our lives are an accumulation of banal events, yet they are meaningful to us. I chuckled at that, while acknowledging the truthfulness of his observation. In sum:Quality of life is about acting/doing and not so much about time, numbers or rank. Murakami talks about his time in a triathlon here, but I would draw (as I suspect he does) a line to our lives in general.Murakami is to make a guest appearance in my town next year, having been awarded the Hans Christian Andersen prize (which Salman Rushdie won last year, J.K. Rowling a few years ago), so I may just have to don my groupie outfit and go seek him out. This book was interesting, but I’ll look forward to reading more of his quirky prose (the only other book I’ve read by him so far being Kafka on the Shore).(*All quotes here are translations from the Danish and may not be the exact equivalents of the English quotes, not to mention the original Japanese)."

Začuđujuće dosta toga. Mada, kada bolje razmislim, sad i vidim zašto ljudi vole Murakamija - blizak nam je, (skoro) svako će se prepoznati u njemu. Metafora koja je baza ove knjige je “Ja nisam trkački konj, ja sam konj za vuču” —> potpuno priznavanje svojih granica, kao i toga da je za svoja postignuća morao dobro da se naradi. I sad svaki čitalac kaže “Uh bre Haruki, pa i ja, evo ništa mi nije palo sa neba, za razliku od drugih, kako me samo kontaš”, ali ja do sada nisam upoznala te druge koji bi za sebe rekli “Ja ne moram ništa da radim, toliko sam talentovan i privilegovan da mi uspeh sam dolazi”.Njegov odnos sa trčanjem je gotovo lišen emocija. Posle svojih dnevnih kilometara i kilometara, u isto vreme oseća zadovoljstvo zbog postignutog ali i čuveno “Oh hvala Bogu da sam završio, da ne moram JOŠ da nastavim da trčim”. To jest, sve do sutrašnjih novih 10km.Njegovo pisanje, kao i trke, vođene su isključivo disciplinom i upornošću, nikako ‘motivacijom’ (evo ne znam ko bi imao motivaciju da trči 10km svakog dana i da svaki put bude “Oh jej baš se osećam ornim i danas da trčim po kiši ledu snegu vetru”, a da pripada ljudskoj vrsti) i ‘strašću’ (svi znamo kako se završavaju određene strasti, smuči ti se toliko da ili pobegneš na drugi kraj sveta ili spališ sve što te podseća na to).Sluške u uši, patike, i korak po korak.

I prefer to walk and take life at a slower pace and running seems like so much exertion! He writes that most runners run ""because they want to live life to the fullest."" What I came to understand as I read, is that setting goals for running and reaching those goals provides a framework for living and adds purpose and meaning to life. He explains further, ""Exerting yourself to the fullest within your individual limits: that's the essence of running and a metaphor for life - and for me, writing as well.""I really enjoyed his thoughts on the changing of the seasons and how they impact runners. He writes that ""runners can detect each notch in the the seasonal shift in the feel of the wind against our skin its smell and direction,"" which I found profound and loved his sensitivity to his natural environment. I especially enjoyed his personal connection with water and his description of the effect of light and wind on the river is lovely.Murakami talks of his personal experience of running by water, ""In the midst of this flow, I'm aware of myself as one tiny piece in the gigantic mosaic of nature. I'm just a replaceable natural phenomenon, like the water in the river that flows under the bridge to the sea."" I just love that. Narration by Ray Porter is good, his voice is easy on the ears.*Fascinating fact: I just read on LitHub that Haruki Murakami completed his first ultramarathon on June 23rd, 1996, exactly 25 years ago today!"

114,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34130752-mar-a-paz-greene-f,Rating 4 out of 5,"No leía a Murakami desde ""Tokio Blues"", que pasó por mis manos hace varios años y que ME ENCANTÓ, pero luego el autor me salió tan en la sopa, que me empezó a caer en desgracia. La culpa, en todo caso, no fue de Murakami mismo, sino que de la intensidad de su fanaticada, demasiado fiel en cada una de las entregas. Tengo un amigo que hasta se puso de nick de messenger (se me cayó el carnet, jajaja), el título de uno de uno de sus libros durante AÑOS, ese de los números (1Q84). Según él que era el mejor del mundo... Yo todavía no me animo a leerlo. Siento que si lo hago terminaré vomitando unicornios de colores.Bueno, ese amigo en realidad era más que un amigo, y no terminó muy bien la cosa, jejeje. Supongo que eso influyó también en mis sentimientos y que la responsabilidad de ese punto en específico al final es mía (¡y de él!).Ahora, volviendo a lo de hoy... me ENCANTÓ. En buena hora volví al ruedo... lo encontré inspirador y sincero y hasta un poquito mágico. Me encantó la visión del autor, tan asiática, en el sentido de que acepta la realidad y la naturaleza como son... en vez de intentar modificarlas a nuestra manera occidental, y me encantó también su visión sobre lo importante que es trabajar en lo nuestro, aunque nuestras existencias sean breves y nuestros resultados limitados, y la misma naturaleza a lo macro no nos ayude. También me encantaron las metáforas y las historias. Una de mis partes favoritas fue cuando le preguntó a un oftalmólogo si conocía a alguien que hubiera podido salvarse de la presbicia (ir perdiendo la vista por el mero envejecer) y éste le contestó que no. Fue como que Murakami trató de ver si se podía ser inmortal pero ya que le djeron que no, buéh, al mal tiempo buena cara. Todo el diálogo fue hecho con muy poca animosidad. Lo encontré tierno y un tanto tragicómico.Con tal que al final todo me gustó mucho y además me sentí identificada porque, aunque yo no corro, siempre he sido buena para caminar, y para caminar durante horas, casi todos los días, y al igual que él prefiero hacerlo en soledad... esa sensación de borrarse de todo... es deliciosa. Y muy importante para la paz mental. Yo también la necesito de una manera más honda de lo que puedo expresar. Es como si uno refloreciera en ello. Cuatro estrellas y no cinco solo porque en ocasiones me cayó un poquitín mal. A veces lo encontré un tanto presuntuoso y despectivo, y tampoco me gustó cómo habló del calentamiento global. Pero el libro es GENIAL. Sincero, inspirador, y yo fui muy feliz, porque hace mucho pero mucho tiempo que no leía algo que me inspirara. Saqué muy buenos tips de él. Subrayé como una loca, cosa que no hago a menudo. Todo lo que dice del correr puede aplicarse a cualquier otra cosa que uno quiera lograr en la vida.Citas que destaqué, que fueron MUCHAS. Se me anduvo pasando la mano, jejeje.1.Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional. (esto salía en la polera de alguien en una maratón).2.En la profesión de novelista, al menos para mí no hay victorias ni derrotas. Tal vez el número de ejemplares vendidos, los premios literarios, o lo buenas o malas que sean las críticas constituyan una referencia de los logros obtenidos, pero no los considero una cuestión esencial. Lo más importante es si lo escrito alcanza o no los parámetros que uno mismo se ha fijado, y frente a esto no hay excusas. Ante otras personas, tal vez, uno pueda explicarse en cierta medida. Pero es imposible engañarse a uno mismo.En ese sentido, escribir novelas se parece a correr un maratón. Por explicarlo de un modo básico, para un creador, la motivación se halla, silenciosa, en su interior, de modo que no precisa buscar en el exterior ni formas ni criterios.3.Si uno lo piensa, quizá este punto de vista también sea aplicable al trabajo del novelista. Los novelistas dotados de talento natural son capaces, sin hacer nada especial (o haciendo cualquier cosa), de escribir novelas con suma facilidad. Las frases les brotan como el agua mana a borbotones de un manantial, y así va surgiendo su obra. No necesitan esforzarse.Hay personas así. Pero, por desgracia, yo no soy como ellas. No es para sentirse orgulloso de ello pero, por más que miro a mi alrededor, no encuentro el manantial por ninguna parte. Tengo que tomar el cincel y el martillo e ir picando poco a poco el suelo rocoso hasta abrir un profundo boquete; si no, no consigo llegar al manantial de la creatividad.Escribir una novela me exige malgastar mucha fuerza física. Me cuesta tiempo y esfuerzo. Cada vez que me propongo escribir una novela, tengo que empezar a cavar un nuevo agujero desde el principio. Con los años, no obstante, uno va fortaleciéndose y dominando las técnicas para poder cavar agujeros en ese duro suelo rocoso y descubrir nuevas vetas de agua de forma bastante eficaz. Y cuando noto que un manantial está a punto de agotarse, puedo pasar a abrir el siguiente con celeridad y determinación. Sin embargo, los que dependen únicamente de los manantiales naturales, aunque de repente se propusieran hacer lo mismo, seguramente no lo conseguirían con tanta facilidad.4.Cuando digo que corro todos los días, hay gente que se admira de ello. A veces me dicen ""Menuda fuerza de voluntad tienes, ¿eh?"". Por supuesto, me alegra que me elogien. Es mucho mejor a que te denuesten. Pero, a mi parecer, tener fuerza de voluntad no significa que uno consiga todo lo que quiere. El mundo no es tan sencillo. O, para ser franco, tengo incluso la impresión de que entre el hecho de correr a diario y tener mucha fuerza de voluntad no existe tanta correlación.Que yo lleve corriendo de este modo más de veinte años supongo que se debe, en definitiva, a que esa actividad va con mi carácter. O, al menos, a que no me acusa tanto sufrimiento. Al ser humano no le cuesta proseguir con algo que le gusta, pero sí con algo que no le gusta. Supongo que la voluntad, o algo parecido a la voluntad, tiene que ver un poco con ello. Por mucha fuerza de voluntad que uno posea, por mucho que sea de los que no se dan por vencidos, si algo no le va, no podrá hacerlo durante largo tiempo. Y, aunque pudiera, seguro que su salud se resentiría.5.El tabique que separa la sana autoconfianza de la insana arrogancia es realmente muy fino.6, al terminar una de las carreras.En un café del pueblo de Maratón, me tomo una cerveza Amstel todo lo fría que quiero. Por supuesto, está buenísima. Pero la cerveza real no está tan buena como la que yo imaginaba y ansiaba fervientemente mientras corría. No existe en ninguna parte del mundo real nada tan bello como las fantasías que alberga quien ha perdido la cordura.7. La cita que me cayó en desgracia sobre el calentamiento global aunque, a su favor, este libro tiene por lo menos diez años y todavía no había tanta información tan clara.En Japón, este verano ha hecho un tiempo muy extraño. El tsuyu (tiempo de lluvias), que normalmente debería de haberse acabado a principios de julio, se prolongó hasta finales de ese mes. Y llovió hasta el hartazgo. Las intensas lluvias torrenciales castigaron a casi todas las regiones y se cobraron muchas víctimas.Se culpa de todo ello al calentamiento global; puede que se deba a ello, o puede que no. Algunos científicos afirman que es así, y otros aseguran que no. Ciertas hipótesis se pueden demostrar, y otras no. Pero la gran mayoría de los problemas a los que se enfrenta el mundo en la actualidad se imputan, en mayor o en menor medida, al calentamiento global.Si caen las ventas en la industria de moda, si las olas arrastran una cantidad ingente de troncos hacia la costa, si se producen inundaciones, si se recrudece la sequía, o si suben los precios al consumo, la responsabilidad se la lleva en su mayor parte el calentamiento global. Lo que necesita el mundo es un malvado concreto, con nombre y apellidos, al que poder señalar con el dedo y espetarle ""¡La culpa es tuya!"".7.Los tiempos individuales, el puesto en la clasificación, tu apariencia o cómo te valore la gente, no son más que cosas secundarias. Para un corredor como yo, lo importante es ir superando, con sus propias piernas y con firmeza, cada una de las metas. Quedarse convencido, a su manera, de que ha dado todo lo que tenía para dar y que ha aguantado como debía. Ir extrayendo alguna enseñanza concreta (no importa lo nimia que sea, pero que sea lo más concreta posible) de las alegrías y los fracasos. Y, a base de tiempo y de años, ir acumulando una por una carreras de ese tipo para, finalmente, sentirse satisfecho. O tal vez, aproximarse, siquiera un poco, a algo parecido a eso (sí, tal vez esta expresión sea más adecuada)."

116,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4695-daniel,Rating 2 out of 5,"Perhaps his translator is partly at fault -- I don't speak Japanese, so it'd be impossible for me to check -- but I can't help blaming Haruki Murakami himself for how badly written and uninteresting ""What I Talk About When I Talk About Running"" is. Given that he does speak, read and translate English, I'm assuming Murakami looked over the English translation of this book before it was published, so I'm holding him responsible. A memoir mostly of his life as a runner of marathons and competitor in triathlons, but also of his career as a novelist, ""Running"" pales miserably in comparison to the fiction of his I've read, including ""The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle,"" ""Hardboiled Wonderland and the End of the World,"" and countless short stories.My chief complaint about ""Running"" is its language. It's so full of meaningless adverbs and adjectives -- ""really,"" ""pretty,"" ""definitely,"" ""very,"" ""extremely"" and twice, I swear to God, Murakami corrects himself to say he meant ""extremely"" rather than ""very"" -- that one would think he'd never written a book before. ""Running"" also is teeming with clichés -- and not just any clichés, but really annoying ones such as, I'm not kidding, ""raining cats and dogs."" It's been a while since I've read any of Murakami's novels, and maybe my memory is failing me, but he didn't rely on such weak language in them, did he? Aside from the poor writing, Murakami has few interesting things to say about either being a runner or being a novelist. For much of the book, he just prattles on and on about how this is how or why he runs, or this is how or why he writes, and that's just how he is, and other people may do it differently. He offers no great insights into either activity. I haven't read much about running, but Raymond Carver -- one of Murakami's idols, and, as the author of ""What I Talk About When I Talk About Love,"" the source of this book's title -- offers dozens more insights into the art of fiction in the five and a half pages of his essay ""On Writing"" (of which Murakami is surely familiar) than in the pages upon pages Murakami devotes to the topic in this book. And that's not to mention all the weather talk. Jesus, Haruki, stop with the goddamn weather. Yes, I know weather must be quite important to runners, but enough about the weather already, especially if you can't find anything more interesting to say about it than how, as mentioned earlier, it was ""raining cats and dogs.""I'm tempted to give this book one star, but my past enjoyment of Murakami's books -- and the fact that I'm not a runner myself, meaning I may have overlooked some of ""Running""'s highly elusive pleasures -- compel me to be generous and give it two. Before ""Running"" came out, The New Yorker ran an excerpt from it that was relatively concise and enjoyable. I, and perhaps Murakami too, should probably have stopped with that essay. And, from here on out, maybe he should stick to fiction."

Kitabı yazmaktaki çıkış noktası ise arada kendisine sorulan ""İnsan sizin gibi sağlıklı bir yaşam sürünce zamanla roman yazamaz hale gelmez mi?"" sorusunun cevabını vermeye yönelik.Bu kitapla birlikte, birbirinden güzel onlarca romanın yazarı, büyülü gerçekçiliğin ustalarından biri olan Haruki Murakami'den bir adım öteye geçiyor ve sporcu Murakami'yi tanımaya başlıyoruz. Oldukça içten, samimi bir dille yazdığı hikayesini okurken sanki bir sohbet masasında karşılıklı oturup onu dinliyormuşuz gibi hissettiriyor. İnsanlarla iletişiminin iyi olmadığını söylemesine karşın kendisi ile iletişiminin mükemmel bir boyutta olduğunu fark ediyoruz. Ne istediğini çok iyi bilen, sınırlarını tanıyan ve başarmak için onları zorlamaktan çekinmeyen güçlü biri özel hayatında Murakami. Kendisinin en büyük rakibi. Koşuculuk anılarının yanı sıra eşi Yoko'nun fikirlerine çok önem verdiğini ve kişisel kararlarının üzerindeki etkisini, 7 yıl kadar bar işletmeciliği yaptığını, biraya düşkünlüğünü :), profesyonel yazarlığa nasıl başladığını, hayatta kendisine kimlerin ilham verdiğini de öğreniyoruz yazılarında. Onunla ilgili geçmişten bildiğim bir şey; Hayatı boyunca en etkilendiği kitabın ""Muhteşem Gatsby"" - F. Scott Fitzgerald olduğu idi fakat kitabın bizzat (Japonca'ya) çevirmenliğini yaptığını yine bu eserinde öğrendim. 30'lu yaşlarının en büyük hayaliymiş bu. Koşmasaydım Yazamazdım, Murakami'nin belki de şimdiye kadarki en kişisel metni. Hayranıysanız mutlaka okumalısınız :)Sevgiyle,

Böylesi bir adalette, arayışa girmeye yetecek değer bulabilmek, elbette herkesin kendine kalmıştır."" * ""Okullarda bizim öğrendiğimiz en önemli şey, en önemli şeylerin okullarda öğrenilemeyeceği gerçeğidir.""* ""Bir de, çok sıradan bir bakış olacak ama, sık sık söylenildiği gibi bir şey yapmaya değerse, o şey coşkuyla (bazı durumlarda aşırıya kaçılarak) yapıldığı ölçüde değerlidir.

123,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2812152-teodora,Rating 4 out of 5,"В тийнейджърските ми години Мураками бе сред любимите ми писатели. От дълго време не бях посягала към негова книга - някакво пренасищане се получи, като че ли, или просто пораснах, знам ли. Ако се вярва на Goodreads, съм прочела книгата веднъж преди точно десет години, но по-ярко помня как си я бях намерила онлайн на английски още в девети клас, прясно излязла; не толкова спомен за разсъжденията на Мураками е останал у мен, колкото за тогавашната ми стая, гледката към Витоша и София от 2007-а. Онзи ден се загледах по лавиците на библиотеката у дома, търсейки си нещо кратко и на български език, за отмора. Попадна ми това издание, в чуден превод на Албена Тодорова. (Впрочем, имам чувството, че е единствената книга на Мураками, преведена у нас от японски, вместо от английски, както първите издания на ""Норвежка гора"" или ""Спутник, моя любов""; надявам се да греша). Каква хубава, мила среща се оказа, точно като със стар другар. Уютно е някак да съм в главата на петдесет-и-няколко годишния Мураками, готвещ се за маратон в Ню Йорк през есента на 2005-а, да слушам за тренировките и саундтрака на бягането му (рок и джаз), писането, дисциплината, привичките и недостатъците му. Приятно, странно разместване на времената усетих с историята за една негова сутрешна тренировка в парк в Токио - спира го жена, която наближава четиридесет, за да му сподели колко харесва книгите му, как е започнала да ги чете ""преди да навърши двайсет"". ""Всички остаряваме"", отбелязва той на страницата. ***""Според Съмърсет Моъм всяко бръснене си има своята философия. Дори и най-незначителното нещо, ако бъде извършвано ден подир ден, добива своего рода съзерцателен, медитативен характер. Бих искал от сърце да се съглася с Моъм.""""Сред интервюираните имаше един, който от самото начало на кариерата си по време на маратон превъртал наум следните думи, научени от по-големия му брат (също бегач): Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional. Това беше неговата мантра. Не е лесно да се улови верният нюанс при превода, но предадено буквално, звучи така: ""Болката е неизбежна. Страданието е въпрос на избор."" Дори докато тича, човек да реши: ""Ааа, трудно ми е, боли, не мога повече"", трудното и болката са неизбежен факт, ала дали може, или не може повече, зависи от преценката на бегача.""За остаряването: ""Сега обитавам свят, който някога не бях в състояние да си представя. Тази мисъл ме кара да се чувствам някак странно. Сам не разбирам добре дали сегашният ми Аз е щастлив, или нещастен, ала смятам, че това не заслужава да бъде разглеждано като отделен проблем. За пръв път ми се случва - предполагам, както на всички останали - да остарявам и чувствата, които изпитвам, също ме сполитат за пръв път. Ако ми се беше случвало поне веднъж преди, щях да мога да разгранича по-ясно едно от друго, но съм напълно начинаещ и не е толкова лесно. Ето защо съм решил, че нямам друг избор, освeн да оставя за после разни дребни решения, да приема нещата в настоящия им вид и заедно с това на първо място да живея. Като небето, облаците и реката. Струва ми се, че в подобно решение несъмнено има някаква комичност, ала в зависимост от настройката на човека то не е съвсем за изхвърляне.""За какво си мисли, докато тича: ""Искам да мисля за реката. Искам да мисля за облаците. Но всъщност не мисля за ��ищо. Просто бягам в сгушеното домашно пространство, в родната тишина. Доста е добре. Кой каквото ще да казва.""""Да, смятам, че някои процеси не търпят промяна под никаква форма. И ако нямаме избор, освен да съжителстваме с тях, това, което можем да сторим, е да променим (или изкривим) себе си чрез упорито повторение и да ги втъчем като част от личността си. Ох, да, така е.""""За нас, хората, вероятно е важно да виждаме много вода всеки ден. Е, с това ""за нас, хората"" май се поувлякох, но ми се струва, че за мен е важно. Ако известно време не виждам вода, започвам да усещам, сякаш по малко губя нещо. Може би донякъде напомня начина, по който се чувстват онези, които обичат музика, ала по някакво стечение на обстоятелствата дълго са били лишени от съприкосновение с нея. Навярно има връзка и фактът, че съм израснал досами морето. Ден подир ден повърхността на водата е все различна - мени се цветът, силуетът на вълните, скоростта на течението. Също така сезоните не пропускат да преобразят растенията и животните наоколо. Облаци във всички размери и форми току се появяват незнайно откъде и изчезват, реката, заляна от слънчева светлина, отразява техните бели върволици веднъж ясно, веднъж размито. В зависимост от сезона, вятърът се променя като с натискане на бутон. По това как докосва кожата ми, по мириса и посоката му мога отчетливо да усетя границите между изнизващите се годишни времена. В този осезаем кръговрат осъзнавам, че не съм нищо повече от мъничко парченце в гигантската мозайка на природата. Аз съм само частица, и то заменяема, от изменчивите природни явления, досущ като речните води, които се провират под мостовете и текат към океана."""

Or maybe I should put it the other way: I run in order to acquire a void.”.This book is a biography/memoir of writer and runner Haruki Murakami.Finally, we will be able to find more about Murakami, the writer who stole our hearts and minds.When you read this book, you feel that you are listening to your best friend, who is telling you everything about his life that you didn’t know before.And that's why I didn't like to finish this book, because I felt that I was going to lose touch with Murakami, I would lose my dear friend.Here we find him talking about running, sports, and how to live a healthy life.We can see him as a normal person who is suffering from his body pain, afraid of gaining weight, and being nervous about the idea that his wife might tell people about his personal secrets.We might see his slightly pessimistic side, but maybe he is just thinking the way I am thinking “Always expect the worst” to not to be surprised by what will happen later.Murakami choose sports life especially running his own way of life, making the running and writing two sides of the same coin, can’t give up on either one of them, because in his opinion he must run to be able to write.He made his own rules that can’t be broken, he made himself a lifestyle suitable for Murakami character, the human being, writer, and runner.The book is so lovable, his writing style was fun and easy to read, he talked about himself honestly and directly, he didn't hide this time behind the characters that he created.I wish this book never ended, and he talked more about his personal life, his love life, about his wife, and his writing style. But maybe we will have another chance to read another personal book that talks more about his secrets.I recommend this book to all Murakami lovers,who wants to discover a new side of him..Haruku Murakami1949-20**Writer (and Runner)At Least He Never Walked."

I don't really care for running. Nor any kind of sport for that matter. Yet I still found this very interesting. Whilst the author gets ready to rung his yearly marathons, he contemplates his life's choices and makes some very interesting observations. He speaks of success and failure, of not meeting one's goals to the fullest, of making decisions that ultimately paid off, etc. Without giving anything else away, I'd like to urge my friends to read this and discover for themselves why this is worth a read.

What I Talk about When I Talk about Running by Haruki MurakamiMy rating: 4 of 5 stars
As close to a Murakami memoir as we're likely to receive for quite some time.
I'm not making any secret of it, I am two weeks shy of my 30th birthday (original text written previously, obviously because I just wrote my brithday blogpost) and my health and fitness levels have been at all time lows in the past twelve months. I think back to when I was a younger man and wonder about the transition from athletic boy to lazy teen to lethargic man and I hardly recognise myself. This was something I couldn't stand the thought of, egged on by the distinct possibility of groaning from exertion whenever I lifted a book in the future I have been steadily working on my fitness for the past month with the aid of the C25K (couch to 5km) running program.One of my least favourite things about exercise is the clothes that people wear, lycra seems far too popular and offensive to my eyes and don't get me started on those shoes they sell these days. It's virtually impossible to get an ordinary white pair of runners these days. Everything comes in neon with padding here, cushioning there, auto corrective-this and anti-that to the point that you may as well not run because the shoe is doing all of the work. I decided that if I was going to exercise I was going to do it on my own terms and be myself not another neon lycra clad automaton and so I came up with a simple outfit that reflects my semi-hipster nature and got in to some serious shoe research on the internet. 





    
      My Nike Pre Montreal Racers: No gimmicks, just running
    
    
Hands up who knows about Steve Prefontaine? I didn't, beyond the fact that Hollywood made TWO biopics of him in quick succession (played by Jared Leto and Billy Crudup) and that he was supposed to be good at running. Turns out Prefontaine is credited with some sort of boom in running back in the 70s and Nike designed a shoe for his Montreal Olympics run (SPOILER ALERT which he never made it to because he died in a car accident at the age of 24,) he also sported a mean moustache which despite my best hipster intentions I could never match.My thoughts; if they were good enough for a running legend like Prefontaine back before technology became so prevalent then dammit they are good enough for me. I must say I love them, if they weren't so blue I'd probably try to find a way to wear them everywhere I go.The idea behind learning to run without all the advanced technology is for my body to be able to cope with the physical act in any circumstances, what use is it getting fit if you have to run for the bus in your work shoes or worse than that, need to outrun some sort of mugger on a murder death kill rampage and can't because you can only run in super cushioned air bubble shoes? It's going well so far, but remember people it's not about the shoes, it's a state of mind.










    
      Day 1: One is not enthused
    
    
Haruki Murakami is one of those authors who has managed to capture my imagination with his prose from the very first time I opened one of his novels. Dance Dance Dance is a benchmark for the kind of literature I wish I could write and I dream of somehow capturing the ennui of 21st century life that he seems to describe with ease in every script I ever conceive. This book, originally bought to encourage Leah in her running pursuits, seemed like the perfect match for where I currently am in my life. I wasn't disappointed.He discusses the way he approaches his runs, why he does it, the way they make him feel and the comparison to writing novels. He doesn't offer tips, this isn't a training log, it's just a document of his thoughts on his career as a running writer and dealing with getting older. Having gotten to the stage of running 5km without too much pain in my out of practice limbs I am starting to feel good about it, with the gently encouraging and optimistic words of Mr Murakami I am feeling even more positive. He makes me want to keep running, to increase my distances, to run marathons. Hell, even being 10 days in to NaNoWriMo without having written a word I even feel positive about my writing abilities. He writes about the ordinary and everyday things with an eye and a voice that is unmatched in contemporary literature and this is reflected in his outlook on his own life.Whilst this slight collection of writings will primarily appeal to runners, to a lesser extent writers, there is a beauty in his approach to life that will fascinate the casual reader of non-fiction work.Originally posted at Blahblahblahgay"

Vì vậy, bạn có thể bỏ qua và tìm một cái khác nghiêm túc và trọng tâm hơn]""Một kẻ trượng phu không bao giờ nhắc đến những người đàn bà y đã chia tay hay khoản tiền thuế y đã đóng. Và tôi nghĩ còn một điều kiện nữa để làm kẻ trượng phu là giữ kín chuyện y làm gì để luôn khỏe mạnh. Một kẻ trượng phu không nên nói mãi chuyện mình làm gì để duy trì sức khỏe.""Đó gần như là trích dẫn đầu tiên đến với tôi, cũng là trích dẫn đã thôi thúc tôi tìm kiếm để rồi sau đó xác quyết là mình sẽ thích cuốn sách này.""Tôi nói gì khi nói về chạy bộ"" là một cuốn sách mỏng, ghi chép những suy nghĩ của nhà văn Haruki Murakami về việc chạy bộ của mình. H.M làm chủ một quán rượu phục vụ nhạc Jazz ở Tokyo trong khoảng 10 năm sau tuổi 20. Rồi một ngày vào độ 30 tuổi, khi đang ngồi trên khán đài sân vận động của đội bóng chày yêu thích và thưởng thức một pha bóng gay cấn, đột nhiên H.M nảy ra ý nghĩ rằng: Biết sao không? Mày có thể thử viết một cuốn tiểu thuyết. Và thế rồi H.M trở thành nhà văn. Ông nghỉ làm ở quán rượu, ở nhà viết văn toàn thời gian. Vì yêu thích công việc mới, và muốn giữ cho mình không bị những thói quen xấu đánh bại, ông đã chọn chạy bộ như một cách để duy trì cảm hứng và sáng tạo cho nghiệp viết văn của mình. Haruki Murakami trở thành một nhà văn thành công và đồng thời trở thành một người chạy bộ.Chạy bộ dần trở thành một hành động tinh thần với H.M. Ông kể rằng giả có ai chỉ trích, hoặc giả như người mà ông nghĩ rằng sẽ hiểu mình kì thực lại không hiểu, tóm lại là nếu như có điều gì khiến ông phiền muộn, thất vọng, v.v... thì ông sẽ chạy bộ lâu hơn một chút. Chẳng có chủ ý nào ở đây. Đơn giản là tự nhiên như vậy. (Đây là một đoạn tôi tâm đắc. Vì nếu là tôi, tôi cũng sẽ như thế.)Nếu nói một cách ẩn dụ, chạy bộ là một quá trình thẩm thấu những gì khiến ta phải muộn phiền, để rồi làm tiêu biến nó. Nhìn theo cách như vậy thì chạy bộ giúp ta tiếp tục sống.Khi chạy bộ ta không nghĩ gì nhiều. Có thể thỉnh thoảng ta có một chút liên tưởng, một chút nghĩ suy khi ta thấy một cảnh trí, một con người trên đường. Nhưng đa phần chúng sẽ sớm biến mất. Tóm lại, ta không suy nghĩ gì nhiều lắm. Ở mặt này thì chạy bộ là một cách để ta đạt tới cái rỗng không. Hay nói khác đi, chạy bộ để ta thiền định.Và còn nữa, việc chạy bộ trong một thời gian dài có vẻ như vô bổ và tẻ nhạt, nhất là trong mắt những con người thực dụng.Nhưng với những người trầm tĩnh, đó là một cách để hiểu hơn về chính họ: Như (tôi đọc được là) khi chúng ta gõ búa đóng đinh, ta là cái quá trình chiếc búa liên tục đóng vào đinh ấy. Chỉ khi nào ta bắt đầu ngẫm nghĩ về hành động đó, băn khoăn và tìm kiếm ý nghĩa của chúng, hoặc đơn giản là ta trải nghiệm một thứ xúc cảm nhất định nào về chuyện này, thì chính lúc ấy ta không còn là cái quá trình vô tri kia, mà trở lại là ta.Chạy bộ (hay cả việc viết review của tôi) cũng chẳng khác v���y là bao. Đơn giản là thông qua một số lần chạy nào đó, ta lại phát kiến ra một điều gì đó mới mẻ và thú vị nơi ta. Như con cá hồi bơi ngược dòng nước, đó là cách mà ta chống lại sức mạnh của cái mà người ta vẫn thường gọi là sống mòn.Cuốn sách này thật ra rất đơn giản. Tuy cũng có nhiều chỗ sâu sắc, thú vị và khiến tôi vô cùng tâm đắc, nhưng về cơ bản thì đó vẫn là một cuốn sách ghi lại trung thực những cảm nghĩ của nhà văn về việc chạy bộ qua 20 năm trời. Thú thật mà nói thì cũng có đôi chỗ tác giả viết khá chán. Nhưng bởi rằng cuốn này được viết trong một khoảng thời gian dài, nên những chuyện như vậy là không có gì khó hiểu. Và cũng không vì thế mà tôi không thích cuốn sách này. Tôi tìm thấy ở tác phẩm không hoàn mĩ kia (đại diện cho một con người không hoàn hảo kia) một dáng dấp của tôi này đây (chính là cái cảm giác tôi có khi đọc cuốn tiểu thuyết đầu tiên của ông, và trở nên yêu thích từ đấy).Nhưng cũng biết đâu, sau một thời gian nào đó, tôi sẽ đột nhiên tự nhủ ""Này! Biết gì không? Tao chán rồi."" và tự nhiên ngừng đọc Haruki Murakami, thậm chí là ngừng đọc. Cũng hệt như cách mà tác giả đã từng có lần chán chạy bộ, và chuyển qua chơi 3 môn phối hợp (bơi - đạp xe - chạy bộ) vậy. Nhưng ít ra cho tới lúc ấy, tôi cũng sẽ vẫn cố gắng gắn bó với sự đọc miễn rằng còn có thể. Và thật may mắn thay, luôn có những người bạn cùng đọc với tôi. Có thể đó không phải một kiểu đồng hành rõ ràng với những cam kết thành lời, nhưng dứt khoát rằng tôi có thể cảm nhận cảm nhận sự đồng hành ấy. Cảm ơn sự hiện diện của bạn, vì nếu không thì tôi đoan chắc rằng mình sẽ không thể duy trì dài lâu.Cuối cùng, tôi muốn cám ơn Hiền Hà, người đã tặng tôi cuốn sách này, cũng là người đã viết lời đề tặng tâm huyết với tất cả sự quan tâm và chân thành mong rằng tôi sẽ thích nó. Điều làm tớ xúc động nhất, chính là bởi cậu đã nhận ra rằng ""tác giả có gì đó giống Quân"". Cảm ơn cậu nhiều lắm : )"

138,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2908629-ellie,Rating 4 out of 5,"For some reason, GR lists me as having read this book before. If I have, I don't remember it. In fact, this book stands out in my memory as having been the only Murakami I (a huge Murakami fan) had not read.I was prejudiced because, although years ago, I ran (badly but with great pleasure), I thought a book about running would be dull to a non-runner. However, I loved it. Murakami believes his running enables his writing, that both long-distance running and writing novels require stamina and physical (not just mental) strength.Although I was never as good a runner as Murakami, I felt my experience was similar to his in a number of ways. I hated getting out of the bed in the morning to run (as I am reluctant now to get up to write) but once I was out running, I was glad. I found running difficult although I found a great deal of pleasure in it, which Murakami, surprisingly, either doesn't or doesn't express. But I shared his satisfaction in overcoming pain and emotional resistance and the desire to meet my own standards as well as gain physical strength for the rest of my life. Not running exactly as exercise but running as a way of, or metaphor for, living.The style of the book is conversational and open. There are not many chances to get a look into this writer's mind so I welcomed this aspect of the book. I also found his remarks about the process of his writing and glimpses of his life fascinating. I guess I'm a true fan girl, which is why reading this book was inevitable.I'm glad I waited since it gave me something to read between the novels. Now I've read everything but Birthday Stories. I guess that's next on my list.Murakami seems to be an understated kind of person but that might belie his passion. It's hard to imagine that anyone who writes as brilliantly as he does (although often with a detached voice) could not have deeper emotions than he shares in this novel.Until the end, this was a 5 star read. For some reason, the end seemed flat to me, the book tapering off to a finish instead of, pardon the analogy, running full force to the end.Nevertheless, I loved most of this book. It was great just to be in the presence of this great writer. I could hardly stop reading. Favorite line: ""sometimes taking time is actually a shortcut."" Something for me to remember."

Tôi luôn ngẫm nghĩ câu hỏi này. Chính xác là mình nghĩ gì khi chạy? Tôi cũng không biết nữa....Tôi chạy bộ để đạt được một sự rỗng không.Nhưng như bạn cũng đoán được, thảng hoặc một ý nghĩ sẽ lẻn vào cái rỗng không này. Tâm trí con người không thể hoàn toàn trống rỗng. Cảm xúc con người không đủ mạnh mẽ hay kiên định để duy trì một tình trạng chân không. Điều tôi muốn nói là, các kiểu tư tưởng và ý nghĩ xâm chiếm những cảm xúc của tôi trong lúc tôi chạy vẫn là thứ yếu so với cái rỗng không ấy. Không có nội dung, chúng chỉ là những ý nghĩ bất chợt tập hợp xung quanh cái rỗng không trung tâm đó.Những ý nghĩ chợt nảy ra trong khi tôi chạy giống như mây trên bầu trời. Mây đủ mọi kích thước khác nhau. Chúng đến rồi đi, trong khi bầu trời vẫn là bầu trời vĩnh cửu. Những đám mây chỉ là những vị khách trên bầu trời đi qua rồi biến mất, bỏ lại bầu trời. Bầu trời vừa tồn tại vừa không tồn tại. Nó có thực thể và đồng thời không. Và ta đón nhận cái khoảng mênh mang ấy và say sưa thưởng ngoạn, chỉ vậy thôi....Nói thật, tôi không thực sự hiểu nguyên nhân đằng sau nỗi buồn người chạy bộ của mình. Hay tại sao bây giờ nó bắt đầu phai nhạt. Còn quá sớm chưa thể giải thích rõ ràng được. Có lẽ thứ duy nhất tôi có thể nói dứt khoát về điều đó là thế này: đời là vậy. Có lẽ điều duy nhất ta có thể làm là chấp nhận nó, dù không thực sự chuyện gì đang xảy ra. Như thuế khóa, thủy triều lên rồi xuống, cái chết của John Lennon, và những cú thổi còi sai của mấy trọng tài World Cup.""""Đích của cuộc đua chỉ là cái mốc tạm thời không có ý nghĩa gì nhiều. Cũng hệt như đời sống của chúng ta. Chẳng phải vì có một cái kết thúc mà tồn tại là có ý nghĩa. Một điểm kết thúc chẳng qua là được dựng lên như một cột mốc tạm thời, hay có lẽ như một ẩn dụ cho bản chất trôi chảy của sự tồn tại."""

Sunt piese ascultate de el când aleargă, sunt orele la care se culcă, sunt schimbări pe care le-a făcut drastic și renunțări asumate. Ce mi-a plăcut cel mai tare e că Murakami nu are atitudinea de mare sfătuitor, ci doar povestește stilul lui de viață, cum se simte el făcând asta și câtă ordine îi aduce perseverența - căci aleargă de zeci de ani aproape zilnic, a făcut peste 26 de maratoane, câteva triatlonuri și un ultra maraton (100 de km într-o zi).

Ova knjiga je o svemu onomu što se događa ispod same radnje trčanja, uvid u psihologiju osobe koja se odlučila na bavljenje ""zdravom aktivnosti"", jer je prethodno odabrala pisanje kao ""nezdravu aktivnost"" (pisanje kao nezdrava aktivnost, potpuno se slažem sa autorom). To je taj princip dvostrukosti, miješati zdravo i nezdravo, ne odricati se niti jednoga. Tu se može saznati kako je Murakami došao na ideju da krene pisati, kako je napisao svoj prvi roman, bez namjere da postane pisac, kako sam kaže, on je to samo postao, a tako isto i trkač, samo je postao, jer je odlučio da treba jednu aktivnost koja će ga ""probiti"", u kojoj će se izgubiti, u kojoj će ""prestat postojati "" u misaonom svijetu dvosmislenosti, gdje će mozak izgubit svoju napornu aktivnost, gdje će doživjet oslobođenje od torture uma. Murakami navodi kako je u dobi od 33.godine započeo s trčanjem (kasnije maratoni,triatloni), kao zanimljivog doba, kao svojevrsnog raskrižja u čovjekovom životu, u tim godinama je Isus umro, a Scott Fitzgerald krenuo silaznom putanjom. On je donio tada neke važne odluke u životu, koje su nam bitne kako on kaže ""da se čovjek ne izgubi kroz život"" i držao ih se vjerno te promatrao sebe i promjene koje mu donose, proučavao sebe. Sljedeće godine punim 33. godine i vrijeme je da donesem neke bitne odluke :)Zanimljive su mi Murakamijeve misli o samoći i prihvaćanju sebe, kako je dok je sa ženom držao Jazz klub bio izložen kroz nekih 7 godina raznolikom i velikom društvu i kako su ga ljudi većinom umarali.

149,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4739465-monica,Rating 4 out of 5,"What goes on in the minds of endurance athletes? What drives them? What is the impetus or nature of this obsession? The key to fomenting understanding of these things lies in the mind of an artist. Murakami is a bit of a Rosetta stone for non endurance athletes, opening a window to those driven souls. It was fascinating to hear the inner monologue that happens in a creative mind. There is something strange about people who are driven to endurance sports. The conventional wisdom is that these are people who enjoy suffering. Not suffering for its own sake, but suffering and then prevailing in spite of the pain or as Murakami would say, because of the pain. ""Of course it was painful, and there were times when, emotionally, I just wanted to chuck it all. But pain seems to be a precondition for this kind of sport. If pain weren't involved, who in the world would ever go to the trouble of taking part in sports like the triathlon or the marathon, which demand such an investment of time and energy? It's precisely because of the pain, precisely because we want to overcome that pain, that we can get the feeling, through this process, of really being alive--or at least a partial sense of it. Your quality of experience is based not on standards such as time or ranking, but on finally awakening to an awareness of the fluidity within action itself."" ""In most cases learning something essential in life requires physical pain.""""Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional.""The thing about endurance sports is that they require tremendous amounts of time. Lots of time is needed to train effectively. Endurance sports give the athletes time to think. Time to process. Time to work things out. Time alone. What people do with that time is fascinating: ""I'm the kind of person who likes to be by himself. To put a finer point on it, I'm the type of person who doesn't find it painful to be alone. I find spending an hour or two everyday running alone, not speaking to anyone as well as four of five hours at my desk, to be neither difficult or boring.""""I just run. I run in void. Or maybe I should put it the other way: I run in order to acquire a void.""Murakami reveals that he is incredibly focused, and disciplined and very hard on himself. I didn't generally think of an author of fiction as driven. Shortcoming on my part to be sure. In my experience success requires focus and discipline and by extension successful people (even creative people) are extremely focused and disciplined. But running here is more of an obsession and it takes a gifted writer to translate the why's of this obsession:""What I should be looking at is inside of me. Like staring down into a deep well. Can I see kindness there? No, all I see is my own nature. My own individual, stubborn, uncooperative often self-centered nature that still doubts itself--that, when troubles occur, tries to find something funny, or something nearly funny, about the situation. I've carried this character around like an old suitcase, down a long, dusty path. I'm not carrying it because I like it. The contents are too heavy, and it looks crummy, fraying in spots. I've carried it with me because there was nothing else I was supposed to carry. Still, I guess I have grown attached to it.""""Being active every day makes it easier to hear that inner voice.""""An unhealthy soul requires a healthy body.""""When I’m criticized unjustly (from my own viewpoint, at least), or when someone I’m sure will understand me doesn’t, I go running for a little longer than usual. By running longer it’s like I can physically exhaust that portion of my discontent. It also makes me realize again how weak I am, how limited my abilities are. I become aware, physically, of these low points. And one of the results of running a little farther than usual is that I become that much stronger. If I’m angry, I direct that anger toward myself. If I have a frustrating experience, I use that to improve myself."" He is a superb amateur runner. He expects quite a bit from himself. He also acknowledges the selfishness inherent in endurance sports. Even in races with thousands of people, it is a solitary event. As previously stated, these things take enormous amounts of discretionary time that could be spent with family, friends etc. The irritation when someone or events get in the way. He talks about how athletes are sometimes at war with themselves, struggling to put in the effort in spite of the lethargy and desire to do other things. He talks about how his body got used to the movements and the pounding and how mentally and physically he got dependent on running and how it makes him feel. Most of all he talks about how running heightens (my words not his) his self-awareness.""No matter how mundane some action might appear, keep at it long enough and it becomes a contemplative, even meditative act.""""Whether it's good for anything or not, cool or totally uncool, in the final analysis what's most important is what you can't see but can feel in your heart.""""In certain areas of my life, I actively seek out solitude. Especially for someone in my line of work, solitude is, more or less, an inevitable circumstance. Sometimes, however, this sense of isolation, like acid spilling out of a bottle, can unconsciously eat away at a person's heart and dissolve it. You could see it, too, as a kind of double-edged sword. It protects me, but at the same time steadily cuts away at me from the inside.""The height of failure in running for Murakami is to walk. He is relentless both in his workouts and in races. His proposed epitaph: ""At least he never walked.""My thoughts on the book was that I loved it and my take away is that Murakami is a badass. He vows to keep running until he can't run anymore. My guess is that day is decades away for this (as of this review) 68 year old man. ""The end of the race is just a temporary marker without much significance. It’s the same with our lives. Just because there’s an end doesn’t mean existence has meaning. An end point is simply set up as a temporary marker, or perhaps as an indirect metaphor for the fleeting nature of existence."" I would like to be that tuned into running. For me the concept isn't foreign, I just don't feel that passion for it. But I respect and love Murakami for his ability to both experience and articulate his passion. Lightning in a bottle. It can't be caught. But I have the same feelings towards cycling so know it to be true…Almost 4.5 StarsI listened the audiobook. Ray Porter was the narrator. He did a fine job."

153,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12831990-jason,Rating 4 out of 5,"Most runners run not because they want to live longer, but because they want to live life to the fullest. If you're going to while away the years, it's far better to live them with clear goals and fully alive then in a fog, and I believe running helps you to do that. Exerting yourself to the fullest within your individual limits: that's the essence of running, and a metaphor for life — and for me, for writing as whole.In this anecdotal running-centric memoir, Murakami gives all his interested readers rare insights into Murakami the man and the writer, but to avid runners there is the added bonus of feeling they know him intimately in a way that runners get to know one another. For those of us that enjoy his books and love to run, this is a great read at a spectacular cross-roads and one that begs to be kept on the shelf to be read as one progresses through life as a reader and long distance runner (I can only imagine what it might add to be a writer as well). This book centers on how Murakami's life as a runner came to be and how it has developed, evolved, and how it has influenced and been influenced by the other major factors in his life - especially writing. It's fairly simply written, but still lovely. The writing is friendly and approachable, but still has his unique writer's voice emanating throughout. There are parts that are meditative and philosophical, yet others that are comical and self-deprecating, often these things seamlessly flow into one another.Personally for me there were many times that I found myself nodding as he related experiences or even motives:I just run. I run in void. Or maybe I should put it the other way: I run in order to acquire a void.Or:I'm often asked what I think about as I run. Usually the people who ask this have never run long distances themselves. I always ponder the question. What exactly do I think about when I'm running? I don't have a clue.And certainly:At around twenty-three miles I start to hate everything. Enough already! My energy has scraped bottom, and I don't want to run anymore. I feel like I'm driving a car on empty. I need a drink, but if I stopped here to drink some water I don't think I could get running again. I'm dying of thirst but lack the strength to even drink water anymore. As these thoughts flit through my mind I gradually start to get angry. Angry at the sheep happily munching grass in an empty lot next to the road, angry at the photographer snapping photos from inside the van.The sound of the shutter grates on my nerves. Who needs this many sheep, anyway?I largely read this book as a runner and so much of the running parts were familiar to me, though the specifics differed (I have never run in Hawaii, Japan, or been unreasonably resentful of sheep while running- cows yes, but never a single sheep that I can recall), but the feelings and experiences in general felt true and recognizable. As a fan of Murakami's I was not disappointed by the glimpses into his writing process or his approach to writing either, but again I read this more as a runner, so that came somewhat secondary for me. Hell, I even timed my reading of this book to coincide with the fall marathon season. As I write this I am one week out from the marathon I have been training for and it is one day before some running friends will be participating in the New York Marathon, which is the race that Murakami is training for for a good portion of this book. This was simply the perfect book to be reading at this time. “I'll be happy if running and I can grow old together.” Me too, and I think this book may help me along that path."

Hoàn toàn không phải như vậy, mà chỉ là những tiểu luận ngắn về chạy bộ. Ông đã nghĩ gì về chạy bộ, nó có ý nghĩa như thế nào với mức độ cá nhân và cuộc đời, sự nghiệp viết của ông. Nó đã giúp đỡ ông mạnh mẽ hơn về mặt thể chất và tinh thần như thế nào để tiếp tục nghề viết suốt hơn hai thập kỷ. Đồng thời trong việc viết về chạy bộ, và viết văn, ông rút ra những triết lý sống của cá nhân mình.Đôi khi người đọc bắt gặp ông đang viết về những suy nghĩ khi đang chạy: bầu trời, dòng sông,... ;trong thời gian training cho các kỳ race ở Mỹ (truyền thống thì có thể kể Boston, New york...) và ở Nhật; lúc thì lội ngược dòng về quá khứ: ông kết hôn lúc còn rất trẻ, quản lý một jazz club, trở thành một nhà văn, trở thành một runner (solo runner), lần đầu chạy 26.2 dặm (full marathon ~42Km) ở Hy Lạp, lần chạy duy nhất ultramarathon 60 dặm (~100Km), và cuộc sống nhiều năm ở nước ngoài... và cả tham gia cuộc thi 3 môn phối hợp (70.3miles: 1,9Km bơi, 90Km đạp xe và 21Km chạy)Điều mà mình thích ở cuốn sách này?Đó là cách viết giản dị, gần gũi và quen thuộc của Murakami. Dù viết về chạy bộ hay về chính cuộc đời mình, ông không khoa trương mà luôn nhận mình còn nhiều thiếu sót, và đó là lí do ông không ngừng rèn luyện chạy bộ đường dài. Mình thích những điều chia sẻ của ông về chạy bộ hơn là công việc viết. Mình biết những runners khác cũng đọc cuốn này, nhiều là đằng khác. Có lẽ runners, cho dù là solo hay group đều tìm thấy một điểm gì đó tương đồng và quen thuộc trong cuốn sách ""Tôi nói gì khi tôi nói về chạy bộ"" của Murakami. Cuốn sách có thể không tạo cảm hứng nhiều cho người mới bắt đầu, nhưng rất có thể có ý nghĩa đối với một người đã chạy được một thời gian, và mong muốn tiếp tục kiên trì theo đuổi nó."

I hope I can take it to heart, both when I run and when I write.***Original Review***Yet another way in which Haruki Murakami is more awesome than you: not only does he write amazing novels and nifty short stories, he’s also a long-distance runner who’s raced in marathons, triathalons, and even a day-long supermarathon in Hokkaido. This book, the first piece of nonfiction I’ve read by him, chronicles a year in his life as a runner. I liked it less than his fiction. Parts are slow: the endless tally serious runners have to make of distances run in such-and-such lengths of time. I liked the book best when Murakami was talking about a specific event, such as running the original marathon course in Greece—when he was telling a story, in other words. I also really liked when he talked about being a novelist in comparison to being a runner—both require discipline and the ability to go the distance. This book is one of the things that inspired me to work on my own stupid novel every damn day.I’m glad I read this, but I wouldn’t recommend it unless you’re a) really into running or b) have recently become a big Murakami fangirl, like some people I could mention."

157,no user info,Rating 1 out of 5,"I love Murakami's dreamy magical realist novels. And I love distance running. So when I heard Murakami had written a book about his experiences as a runner, I figured it would be right up my alley. I was terribly disappointed. The book literally reads like a diary. Here's a typical paragraph: ""Out the window of my campus office I watched the snowflakes falling. My physical condition isn't too bad. When I get too tired from training, my legs tend to get heavy and my running is unsteady, but these days I feel light as I start off. My legs aren't so tired anymore, and I feel like I want to run even more."" Are they just letting Murakami publish whatever he wants these days? He's a genius, but this is just a genius's boring old running diary. There are sections where he considers how running is similar to writing (isolating, slightly perverse, etc), and he has interesting observations--but here there is none of the creativity he shows in his novels. I wouldn't even call it ""creative non-fiction,"" it's so lacking in creative description.Oh, and I think his running practices are dumb. He goes on and on about his marathon times and his disappointment when he doesn't improve his performance, and he's proud of never talking walk breaks. Lots of marathoners take walk breaks, and most do it not for the PR but the experience! Relax and enjoy your run, Murakami."

163,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1424859-bonnie,Rating 3 out of 5,"3½ starsHaruki Murakami is new to me, but evidently not to many: he has quite a number of fans on Goodreads. I decided that by way of introduction, I would begin with reading his Memoir because the title suggests it’s about running, and I like to think of myself as a runner. The book jacket goes further, telling us that Murakami reflects upon the influence running has had on, not only his life, but, more importantly, on his writing. He runs; I run. He writes novels; I’m writing a novel. Why wouldn’t I pick it up?Now that I’ve read it, I wouldn’t say I regret doing so, but I confess I was a little disappointed to discover that references to running -- mainly marathons, actually -- far outweighed comments connecting the sport with his writing. And that’s another thing. I didn’t think this book was that well written, overall. But I am sure novel-writing is his strength, so I haven’t “written the guy off”, so to speak. I gave this book three stars because parts of it are well written, and I definitely could relate to much of it. As Haruki says, “Even if the skill level varies, there are things that only runners understand and share. I truly believe that.” As do I. And when he does talk about writing, he has specific things to say. For instance, he says that the most important quality a novelist has to have is talent: “If you don’t have any fuel, even the best car won’t run.” The next important quality for a novelist to have is focus; that if you have focus, “you’ll be able to compensate for an erratic talent or even a shortage of it.” And after focus, “the most important thing for a novelist is, hands down, endurance.” Both distance-running and distance-writing require focus and endurance. He says you’ll naturally sharpen both by sitting down every day to write; likewise with daily running – by running, that is, not sitting down. “Almost imperceptibly you’ll make the bar rise.” But what made me smile, and the reason for the extra half-star: Writing novels, to me, is basically a kind of manual labor. Writing itself is mental labor, but finishing an entire book is closer to manual labor.... Most people, though, only see the surface reality of writing and think of writers as involved in quiet, intellectual work done in their study. If you have the strength to lift a coffee cup, they figure, you can write a novel. But… sitting at your desk, focusing your mind like a laser beam, imagining something out of a blank horizon, creating a story, selecting the right words, one by one, keeping the whole flow of the story on track – requires far more energy, over a long period than most people ever imagine. You might not move your body around, but there’s grueling, dynamic labor going on inside you. Everybody uses their minds when they think. But a writer puts on an outfit called narrative and thinks with his entire being; and for the novelist that process requires putting into play all of your physical reserve, often to the point of overexertion. This is so true. And it is why I try to make myself take a break, go for a run. It not only allows me to stretch my limbs, it allows me to let my brain run free. Murakami says that expressions on the faces of people who run regularly are all the same: they look like they’re thinking about something as they run even though they may really be thinking about nothing at all. This reminded me of when I used to run 10 km at least six days a week. I did that for years. Unlike Haruki, though, I never did and never do, listen to music when I run. I take in the scenery, and as I said, allow my mind to wander. When on a run as a break from working on my novel, I have learned that carrying a notepad and small pencil is a must, because if I don’t, any idea — and there will always be an idea, or I’ll realize I need to change something – will get lost in the wind if I don’t stop to write it down. I learned this lesson when I found that repeating an idea over and over again until arriving back home didn’t work, either. Running and mind-wandering go together. So who is this book for, really? Anyone who either runs marathons or participates in triathlons or does both, would at least find a kindred spirit in this author. Actually, I don’t race anymore, and the longest race I ever participated in was a half-marathon, but it was interesting reading about his training, the inevitable pain, his aging, and how that has changed what he can expect from his body. Yes, aging means one must adapt, something I’ve certainly had to come to terms with, as has Haruki Murakami. An interesting man; I must read something else by him. I have decided on Norwegian Wood. That is, unless anyone has a better suggestion. "

Perché? Prima di tutto perché mi attirava il titolo, in secundis perché non volevo iniziare un suo romanzo ma una sua opera diciamo meno impegnativa come questa che è una sorta di diario di viaggio. Qui l'autore giapponese ci narra la sua personalissima esperienza di corridore e anche di scrittore, cose che entrambe lo affascinano e che nella sua vita combaciano in maniera perfetta. Mi è piaciuto. E molto. Murakami scrive senza censura, come se parlasse con se stesso, e in effetti ci rivela nella prima pagina ""la regola vuole che un vero gentiluomo non parli delle sue ex fidanzate, né delle tasse che paga [...] Io, però, non sono un gentiluomo, quindi del galateo me ne infischio. Tuttavia provo un leggero imbarazzo a scrivere questo libro, benché non si tratti di un manuale di igiene fisico-mentale, ma di un testo sulla corsa a piedi [...] Voglio solo fare alcune riflessioni, o forse un soliloquio, su ciò che ha significato per me, per la mia persona, praticare la corsa per tutto questo tempo"". Intanto scopriamo che Murakami, quando corre, ascolta la musica. Soprattutto i Lovin' Spoonful, Carla Thomas, Otis Redding, Eric Clapton, Rolling Stones, Vernon Duke, Brian Adams e molti altri.Il testo di Murakami fissa il periodo di tempo che va dall'estate del 2005 fino all'autunno del 2006. L'autore ci parlerà come un compagno di corsa, svelandoci la sua vita privata, i suoi gusti letterari, come sono nati i suoi primi romanzi, le fatiche e le gioie che gli ha riservato la vita. Ed è bello come ci descrive proprio il suo primo approccio alla scrittura: ""Stavo per compiere trent'anni. Ero arrivato a un'età in cui non potevo più definirmi ""un giovane"". Così ho concepito il proposito di scrivere dei romanzi - una cosa che non mi era mai passata per la mente prima di allora. [...] Era il 1° aprile 1978, verso l'una e mezzo del pomeriggio. Quel giorno, seduto sulla gradinata dello stadio di Jingu, guardavo una partita di baseball bevendo una birra. [...] Hilton fece una battuta a terra lungo la linea sinistra del campo - il suono secco della palla contro la mazza risuonò nello stadio - poi a velocità pazzesca girò la prima base e si fermò sulla seconda. Ecco, fu in quel momento che mi colpì il pensiero 'voglio scrivere un romanzo'. [...] Mi recai in una cartoleria di Shinjuku, comprai una risma di fogli e una stilografica da circa mille yen. Un piccolo investimento di capitale. Questo succedeva in primavera, in autunno avevo finito di scrivere un'opera di duecento fogli da quattrocento caratteri. Mi sentivo molto soddisfatto. [...] E' il romanzo che venne poi pubblicato con il titolo Ascolta la canzone nel vento. Ciò che mi interessava era la scrittura in sé, non tanto che il libro vedesse o meno la luce"".Adesso cito alcune frasi del libro che a me sono molto piaciute: ""Ciò che mi interessa è se riesco o meno a raggiungere gli obiettivi che io stesso mi sono prefisso. [...] Scrivere un libro è un po' come correre una maratona, la motivazione in sostanza è della stessa natura: uno stimolo interiore silenzioso e preciso, che non cerca conferma in un giudizio esterno. [...] L'essenziale è superare anche di poco il livello raggiunto in precedenza. [...] Una persona riesce a costruire la propria personalità e a preservare la propria autonomia proprio perché è differente da tutte le altre. [...] Quando faccio qualcosa, qualunque essa sia, se non mi ci dedico anima e corpo non concludo nulla, sono fatto così. [...] Bene o male sono arrivato alla laurea, ma non rammento di aver mai trovato, nemmeno una volta, qualche attrattiva nello studio. [...] Non si può essere simpatici a tutti, la verità è questa""."
165,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2481560-ahtims,Rating 4 out of 5,"Thank you, Murakami, for letting me peek into tiny slices of your life. why I choose this book?Murakami is one of my favourite authors and I don't let past an opportunity to voyuer into my favourite writer's lives. Hence when I got to buy this book at a discount sale by Amazon, I I was pretty sharp about ordering it asap. Though this book languished in my shelf for more than a year, it was never out of my mind. So while playing Literary bingo with few close friends, and the card read , read an author whose name starts with H, I took it as a sign from providence. Took me two days to complete it, mainly due to lack of time, but enjoyed every minute of reading, especially the first three quarters. The last quarter was slightly repetitive and I didn't like it as much.Murakami also mentions a few bits and pieces about his early years as a bar tender and his first few books...after which he concentrates mainly on running, marathons, physical training, triathlon and such. Title is apt, and is not misleading. Still, the reader in me wanted to know more about his circumstances which led to penning of individual books, especially favourites like Norwegian wood and Windup bird chronicles. But he never mentions his famous titles. Hence a bit disappointed. Have resolved to read all his works in chronological order, which means I will be 're reading a few books. But absolutely no complaints. I also got many glimpses of his love for music, and came to know of his impressive music collection.All in All, a very good read."

The author took up running not long after he started writing. He eventually became a marathon runner, triathlete, and even completed an ultramarathon. This book is short and covers many parallels between what it takes to be a distance runner and a novelist. I was interested in this book due to my past efforts in marathon running, and also due to my fairly recent discovery of Murakami’s fiction. While this book is in a different category than his fiction, it is well told and insightful. I could relate to his views about solitude, focus, and competing against oneself. I would definitely recommend it to runners, as Murakami articulates what draws some people to it (and also understands it is not for everyone). While it does not reach the heights of creativity that I have experienced with his fiction, I certainly enjoyed it and recommend it. “If pain weren't involved, who in the world would ever go to the trouble of taking part in sports like the triathlon or the marathon, which demand such an investment of time and energy? It's precisely because of the pain, precisely because we want to overcome that pain, that we can get the feeling, through this process, of really being alive.”"
167,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19977850-flybyreader,Rating 4 out of 5,"“Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional. Say you’re running and you think, ‘Man, this hurts, I can’t take it anymore. The ‘hurt’ part is an unavoidable reality, but whether or not you can stand anymore is up to the runner himself.” I’ve recently participated in a race and by the end of it, all I could think about was: why the hell am I doing this to myself over and over again? I will exert myself over something more enjoyable from now on.So this book came at a time I lost all my confidence and pleasure in running and I can say it restored my faith. He obviously has a unique character taking running to such extremes as to run at least a marathon each year, pushing himself to limits. I now have completely different respect for the author, it was a motivating book and reading about his running journey and how this fulfilling act helped him become successful in his career by clearing his mind and keeping him healthy made me look at it from a completely new perspective. Recommended for all the runners out there, either amateur or professional.“I've always done whatever I felt like doing in life. People may try to stop me, and convince me I'm wrong, but I won't change.” "

I to je u redu, dešava se. A verujem i da on ne bi želeo publiku poput mene, šta da se radi. Iako se ne osećam preterano uzbuđeno povodom onoga što Murakami piše, već godinu dana delovalo mi je zanimljivo da pročitam njegove misli na temu sporta, budući da se i sama rekreativno bavim trčanjem. Uočila sam izvesne sličnosti u našem karakteru (mrtva trka ko je veći mazohista), međutim nije bilo čak ni zanimljivo, a ponajmanje kvalitetno. Ako dodam na to da je retrospektivno pripovedanje koje on koristi suviše neodređeno i neprecizno za moj ukus, fokus praktično nepostojeći, jasno je (još jednom) da nemam visoko mišljenje o njegovim književnim dometima.

I'm always let in a reflective and contemplative mood. This short but insightful read was no different. As I'm slowly working my way through all of Murakami's works ( this book is my fifth one of his ) I'm surprised at how all his works are layered and full of life lessons for all. I'm always a sucker for a well-written book but authors that are able to write a story and the reader is able to see parallels of greater truths underlying the main story, is worthy of the praise, of a job well done on that author's part. This book is basically a memoir of Haruki Murakami's life on how he became an author and what are some of his practices ( namely running ) that help him keep sharp at the profession that he loves. I found this so relatable to my own lifestyle that at times time I felt as though he was writing about me. Don't get me wrong I'm no runner but I do walk every single day. I love walking as it helps clear my head and helps me put things in the order that they need to be placed in my life. When I don't walk, I feel frustrated and stifled, almost clogged up and I can't seem to get my creative juices to run the way that it would normally do if I had walked. I've made it a practice of mine to carve out specific times every day for projects that I have committed to finishing. I do these religiously every day despite my feelings and have reaped the wonderful feeling of success whenever I complete a specific task I set for myself. This memoir of Murakami's mirrors a lot of my personal life story and I will definitely put this as one of my fave reads of his as it speaks to me personally."
177,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47417894-laura-noggle,Rating 5 out of 5,"I have a special place in my heart for Murakami, even more so after reading my first of his nonfiction books. If you've read much of his fiction, you probably won't be too surprised by his lifestyle and personality quirks. He comes across almost as one of the characters of his books, quiet, enjoys time alone, and a passionate yet methodical runner. This is actually an enchanting memoir with beautiful insights. All Murakami fans should give this one a chance. “Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional.” “I’m the kind of person who likes to be by himself. To put a finer point on it, I’m the type of person who doesn’t find it painful to be alone. I find spending an hour or two every day running alone, not speaking to anyone, as well as four or five hours alone at my desk, to be neither difficult nor boring. I’ve had this tendency ever since I was young, when, given a choice, I much preferred reading books on my own or concentrating on listening to music over being with someone else. I could always think of things to do by myself.” “All I do is keep on running in my own cozy, homemade void, my own nostalgic silence. And this is a pretty wonderful thing. No matter what anybody else says.” “For me, running is both exercise and a metaphor. Running day after day, piling up the races, bit by bit I raise the bar, and by clearing each level I elevate myself. At least that’s why I’ve put in the effort day after day: to raise my own level. I’m no great runner, by any means. I’m at an ordinary – or perhaps more like mediocre – level. But that’s not the point. The point is whether or not I improved over yesterday. In long-distance running the only opponent you have to beat is yourself, the way you used to be.”"

Các cơ của bạn rất tận tụy nếu bạn tuân thủ quy trình, chỉ có thằng cha tên não luôn kiếm cớ thôi. Nhưng chỉ cần dừng lại một vài ngày, các cơ sẽ tưởng rằng mình không phải làm công việc nặng nhọc ấy nữa. Và chúng hạ các giới hạn của mình xuống.5. Có lúc cơ thể của bạn rệu rã, gào thét nói rằng nó đã đến giới hạn rồi, nó không thể chạy thêm nữa. Khi đó, hãy bảo nó im mẹ mồm và tiếp tục chạy.  Bạn sẽ thành công thôi.  6.Khi người ta chết, tư tưởng của họ có đi luôn không?Đây là câu hỏi mà mình đã băn khoăn rất nhiều khi nghĩ về cái chết, và đọc đến đây, mình bất chợt nhớ về anh chàng Au trong Khi Lỗi Thuộc Về Những Vì Sao  7 Murakami kể chuyện đi bơi của ổng. Và mình bất chợt nhớ lại những khoảng khắc bơi của mình. Thật lạ là những lúc đấy, tim mình đập rất nhẹ, và mình cảm thấy bình yên, như giai điệu bài Ocean Eyes. Kết Mình định đọc quyển này để lấy tinh thần chạy bộ giảm béo, và nó khá có tác dụng. Quyển sách tuyệt vời.   ♪ BGM ♪ Unstoppable || Sia"

Mình rất thích những cuốn tự truyện nhưng không có nhiều cuốn mà mình biết và tự truyện của một runner kiêm tiểu thuyết gia lại càng hiếm. Đọc lại lần thứ năm rồi, mình không thực sự tìm thấy nhiều điều mới mẻ nữa, nhưng vẫn không thôi ngạc nhiên trước sự kiên trì và bền bỉ của Murakami. Trước đó mình ko biết ông này vừa là nhà văn lại là một người chạy bộ đường dài, quan tâm tới sức khỏe và sống một cuộc sống lành mạnh, khác hẳn với suy nghĩ trước đây của mình khi nghĩ về những người l��m trong lĩnh vực nghệ thuật. Nhưng cho tới khi mình cũng tập luyện nhiều mới bắt đầu hiểu những gì mà 1 runner trải qua. Đọc cuốn này giống như đọc câu chuyện của một người bạn tâm giao vậy, mình thích những đoạn đơn giản như mô tả bầu trời, dòng sông, thời tiết ấy, vì đó cũng là những gì mình cảm nhận khi chạy bộ gần như mỗi ngày, và tập luyện cho race sắp tới.Vẫn xin trích dẫn đoạn văn yêu thích của mình""Mọi người đôi khi cười khẩy những người chạy bộ mỗi ngày, tuyên bố là họ sẽ làm bất cứ gì có thể để sống thọ hơn. Nhưng tôi không nghĩ đó là lí do hầu hết người ta chạy. Hầu hết những người chạy bộ chạy ko phải vì họ muốn sống lâu hơn, mà vì họ muốn sống trọn vẹn. Ngay cả khi ta chỉ định sống cho qua ngay đoạn tháng thì vẫn tốt hơn nhiều nếu sống những năm tháng ấy với những mục tiêu rõ ràng và sống động trọn vẹn thay vì bối rối hoang mang, và tôi tin chạy bộ giúp chúng ta làm được điều đó. Cố gắng tối đa trong những giới hạn cá nhân của mình: đó là bản chất của chạy bộ, và là một ẩn dụ cho cuộc sống - cho tôi, và cả cho viết lách. Tôi tin rằng nhiều người chạy sẽ tán thành."""

Thật ra, bác hoàn toàn có quyền tự hào về những điều đó, chẳng sao cả. Nhưng bác cứ nhai đi nhai lại hoài mấy chuyện đó đâm ra thấy nhàm.

Khi chọn cuốn sách này, mình đã mong được biết thêm về cuộc sống riêng tư của tác giả, thói quen sáng tác của ông, những suy tư trăn trở về cuộc sống và nghề nghiệp thông qua sở thích chạy bộ. Tuy nhiên, những điều này chỉ được đề cập một cách hời hợt, ngay cả chủ đề chạy bộ cũng không có sự đào sâu nào ngoài một vài liên hệ chủ quan tới việc viết lách. Trên những chặng đường marathon của Haruki, mình chỉ ấn tượng ở một vài đoạn. Như lúc bác nhìn thấy xác những con vật bị xe đụng, hoặc lúc bác buộc bản thân phải vượt qua những giới hạn về thể xác. Phần còn lại như nước trôi qua cầu, vừa lật trang đã cuốn sạch khỏi đầu.

In ogni caso, come dice bene l’autore nella prefazione, questo non è un vero saggio sull’arte del correre, ma una sorta di memoire sulla sua vita personale e professionale, e come si è avvicinato a questo sport.La parte che mi è piaciuta di più è stata sicuramente la prima metà, perchè non era così tanto concentrata sullo sport, ma parlava molto di se stesso, di cosa faceva prima di scrivere, e i suoi primi approcci al mestiere.Come l’aver deciso di cambiare professione, da una più movimentata ad una più sedentaria, l’avesse costretto a muoversi di più per mantenersi in forma e migliorare anche la sua scrittura.Ci sono tanti passaggi che ho sentito miei, che sono pensieri che ho pure io, e lui li ha espressi in maniera magnifica e mi sono sentita meno sola.Era come se fosse lì davanti a me e mi raccontasse la sua vita: questo per farvi capire quanto era scritto bene e come scorresse.Infatti, l’ho letto in un giorno, anche perchè sono solo 146 pagine.La seconda parte è comunque bella, ma va più in profondità sulle sue esperienze come corridore e parla meno di se stesso, quindi, se non si è appassionati dalla corsa, può risultare meno interessante.Sicuramente, però, mi ha fatto venire voglia di correre, e questo è un buon segno."

What I Talk About When I Talk About Running is a memoir related to running. Murakami talks about different memories he has that are around different running routes, half marathons and marathons he has done all around the world. As someone who is not a runner I wasn't so sure I would find this a good read, but I really did. Even though the book does talk about running, why he runs and the places he has run, Murakami also talks about other memories and events that were happening in his life at the same time. I actually found it a very intriguing book and was not bored for a second. It is a very unique type of memoir that I have not come across before and I found it refreshing. Personally I wished the book had been longer and more in depth than it was, it definitely left me wanting more and that is why I have not given it a higher rating.If you are a Murakami fan then you will not be disappointed by this non-fiction book as it reads very much like his other works, even though it is about him. I think it's a book that anyone could pick up and be pulled in by, but especially runners. I think people who run would definitely relate to a lot of what is written and enjoy it."

209,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43394596-quang,Rating 3 out of 5,"Cuốn sách của Haruki Murakami đầu tiên mà mình đọc lại là cuốn sách nói về chạy bộ, chứ không phải các cuốn tiểu thuyết đình đám. Lạ, giống như cuốn sách này vậy.Thật lạ khi ngồi đọc về…sinh hoạt thể dục thể thao của một người dưng. Nếu cuốn này chỉ đơn thuần kể về tôi bắt đầu chạy như thế nào, tôi đã chạy ở đâu, tập luyện ra sao, có thành tích gì, rút được kinh nghiệm gì, bài học gì thì nó cực kỳ nhạt nhẽo, chả thà lên YouTube hay đọc sách do các runner chuyên nghiệp viết còn hơn. May thay, cuốn sách này và cả về việc chạy bộ đã được viết bởi một nhà văn tài năng nên nó vẫn có sức sống và màu sắc riêng biệt đủ để giữ “mắt” người đọc phổ thông và cả runner.Có mấy ai tự nhiên đang chạy bộ, hay chơi thể thao mà đi nghĩ về công việc mình đang làm có điểm gì tương đồng hay ý nghĩa của công việc thường nhật của bản thân là gì. Ông Murakami thì khác. Ông coi việc chạy bộ chính là một công cụ hỗ trợ cho công tác sáng tạo và nghiệp viết của mình. Ông muốn khỏe mạnh, sống lâu vì chỉ có thế thì ông mới có thể viết lâu, viết thêm các tác phẩm khác. Với ông, kiên trì là một tài sản cần tích cóp qua nhiều năm và chạy bộ chính là “chiếc máy” sản xuất ra loại tài sản này. Chính nhờ kiên trì trong suốt thời gian qua đã giúp ông trở thành một tiểu thuyết gia…chuyên nghiệp. Chuyên nghiệp ở đây có nghĩa là duy trì phong độ ở mức cao nhất và khao khát những mục tiêu cao hơn qua mỗi chu kỳ trong sự nghiệp, như cái cách mà Messi và Ronaldo đã làm được trong hơn một thập kỉ trên sân cỏ. Với ông, duy trì việc chạy bộ cũng như việc viết trong suốt ¼ thế kỉ nó cũng là một thành tựu to lớn ngang như thành tựu của Messi và Ronaldo, mà không phải nhiều nhà văn có thể làm được. Trái ngọt ông hái được là những cuốn sách ông tâm đắc, đem lại cho ông những giải thưởng và sự công nhận của giới chuyên môn cũng như của người đọc.Không chỉ thế, ông Murakami còn coi chạy bộ là một lăng kính để nhìn nhận về cuộc đời. Với ông, cuộc đời phải có đau thì mới sướng, cũng như chạy bộ thì các cơ bắp phải gào thét đau đớn thì khi về đích mới vỡ òa hạnh phúc. Với ông, cuộc đời sẽ lắm lúc chán vì cứ lặp đi lặp lại, y như chạy bộ. Với ông, cuộc đời sẽ có lúc gặp nhiều trắc trở bất ngờ, như những chấn thương ngoài dự kiến trong chạy bộ. Thế nhưng, để tận hưởng chạy bộ, ông đã bỏ công sức tập luyện, cũng như đề ra những mục tiêu nhất định để cố gắng đạt được. Trong quá trình tiến tới mục tiêu, vượt qua những chấn thương và cám dỗ bỏ cuộc cũng là thứ khiến cho việc chạy bộ trở nên thú vị. Chiếu theo đó, cuộc sống cũng như vậy; cũng cần có mục tiêu, ngã ở đâu đứng dậy ở đó, có lên có xuống thì tự khắc cuộc sống sẽ bớt chán. Đọc xong cuốn này, mình nhận ra ông Haruki Murakami là một người cực kỳ tài năng trong việc để ý những tiểu tiết. Ông có một sự cảm nhận cơ thể cực kì tốt. Khi chạy bộ đường dài hay chơi 3 môn phối hợp, ông sẽ biết các phần cơ nào hoạt động nhiều, chỗ nào đang đau cần phải để ý tới, thậm chí nhân hóa luôn cả cái cơ bắp đó để trò chuyện như một người đồng hành; ông biết nhịp thở ra sao, cơ thể đã quá tải hay vẫn có thể tiếp tục. Đây là một năng lực cần thiết đối với dân chơi thể thao để tránh việc cố quá rồi…quá cố. Không chỉ dừng ở m��c cơ thể vật lý, việc quan sát được cảm xúc và kiếm soát nó cũng là một khả năng vượt trội của nhà văn này. Khi chạy bộ, ngoài việc điều khiển cơ thể tiến tới, ông Murakami còn dành thời gian ra quan sát mình đang cảm thấy vui buồn chán nản ra sao trong suốt cuộc chạy; và có khoảnh khắc, trong lúc chạy super marathon, ông đã miêu tả chạy bộ như một hoạt động thiền “động”; khi cơ thể ông đến giới hạn thì ông chạy như không chạy, đầu óc như nhìn thấy chân trời mới về việc chạy và về bản thân mình. Người thường chạy bộ mệt chết cha, hơi sức đâu mà Giác ngộ!Chính những miêu tả về những cảm xúc hết sức cá nhân này đem lại màu sắc cho bức tranh chạy bộ đơn điệu và điều này là thứ giữ mình lại tới trang cuối cùng của cuốn sách.Cũng như với thể loại tự truyện nói chung thì với cá nhân mình, nhịp điệu bình bình, đều đều chính là điểm trừ. Đôi lúc có những dòng tâm trạng của tác giả khiến nhịp điệu ấy đi lên đôi chút nhưng tổng thể vẫn là một tông giọng đều, ru ngủ. May sao, nhờ những trài nghiệm và cảm nhận cá nhân khá sâu sắc, độc đáo của tác giả nên dù sách có hơi chán nhưng mình vẫn có thể đọc được hết.Ai runner có thể tìm đọc. Ai không phải runner vẫn có thể tìm đọc để thành runner.Ai đã chạy marathon có thể tìm đọc để xem có chung tần số hay chung cảm nhận với tác giả hay không."

Nhưng vấn đề là cuốn sách này là một non-fiction nên tôi lại phải tìm một phương diện phù hợp hơn để xem xét nó. Cuối cùng, tôi quyết định đọc nó như một cách để đối chiếu Murakami được nhào nặn trong tưởng tượng của tôi với Murakami ngoài đời thực, đích thị là đọc có thú vị hơn.*Phải thú thật là tôi khá ú ớ khi biết Thôn Thượng Xuân Thụ (haha, tôi định troll một tí, cái tên phiên âm tiếng Việt này thật không yêu nổi :))) đã có vợ, hơn nữa còn có từ rất sớm. Tôi cứ luôn nghĩ ông thuộc giáo phái độc thân thảm thiết cơ.Tôi cũng thấy khó hình dung một gã đàn ông làm ông chủ một quán bar nhộn nhịp về đêm lại thích nhắm mắt nghe tái hồi mấy chiếc đĩa than đầy nhong nhóc nhạc cổ điển (hoặc một quán bar chơi các thể loại nhạc hàn lâm, cũng kì quái và không tưởng thế thôi mà). Bây giờ thì tôi biết quán bar cũng có thể chơi Jazz (như quán của Murakami) chứ không cứ là phải có một tay cao bồi đô con da rám nắng người sặc mùi thuốc súng cầm cái thòng lọng quay quay hoặc một đám thanh niên chơi thuốc lắc rồi nhảy nhót xõa xượi như bọn điên như phim ảnh thường ám thị. (Đừng cười tôi, để tôi tự cười :)))Tất nhiên, tôi càng cực kì ngạc nhiên về chuyện Murakami là một người chạy chuyên nghiệp, người bơi chuyên nghiệp, người đạp xe chuyên nghiệp, người từng tham gia 25(+) cuộc đua marathon và nhiều cuộc thi ba môn phối hợp khác như một vận động viên thực thụ. Tôi tưởng ông sống một cuộc sống bừa bộn và uể oải hơn, còn ông làm tôi muốn bắt đầu chạy bộ.Tôi cũng cười khi ông thêm một lần nữa, chẳng rõ là đã bao nhiêu lần rồi, nhấn mạnh rằng thì ông chả quan tâm đến các giải thưởng. Dù sao thì thật sự là nó vẫn rất hài hước, chuyện cái giải Nobel chết tiệt ấy mà.Lần này thì không có mèo.*Murakami ở đây bình dị, giống như bất cứ ai trên quả đất già 7 tỉ người này. Không chết chóc, không huyền hoặc, không lạc lõng, không lập dị như tác phẩm của ông nữa; chỉ là một người đàn ông bình thường, thậm chí có đôi phần vô vị tẻ nhạt chỉ toàn nói chuyện trời xanh mây trắng với kĩ thuật chạy bộ và viết tiểu thuyết mà thôi. Bên cạnh nhiều cảm xúc khi đọc tiểu thuyết của ông, tôi thích cả phần vô vị tẻ nhạt đời thường ấy. Nó tuyệt!*""Mười sáu là một tuổi cực kỳ rắc rối. Ta lo lắng về những thứ nhỏ nhặt, không xác định được mình ở đâu theo một cách thức khách quan nào cả, trở nên rất chi thành thạo những kỹ năng lạ lùng, vô nghĩa, và nô lệ cho những mặc cảm không thể cắt nghĩa nổi. Dù sao, khi ta lớn hơn, bằng cách thử và sai, ta học cách đạt được cái ta cần và ném đi cái cần phải bỏ. Và ta bắt đầu nhận ra (hay đành chấp nhận thực tế) rằng do lỗi lầm và khiếm khuyết của ta gần như vô tận, tốt nhất ta nên nhận thức ra những ưu điểm của mình và học cách xoay xở với cái mình có."""

I wouldn't consider myself a runner. Not yet anyway. It's only recently something that I've gotten into. About a month ago. So now, while everyone is busy trying to make good on their New Year's resolutions, I can come into the New Year feeling like I'm already well into at least one of them.But no, I wouldn't consider myself a runner yet.I'm not sure how many runs one needs to complete, and in what timeframe, before they can be called a ""runner"" without that inkling of doubt that appears immediately afterward, the doubt that tells you you're putting on airs, that you're exaggerating, that you won't keep this up for long. Truth be told, my knee is already bothering me. It's only ever just the right one for some reason. But, assuming I keep this running thing up, I can already see a future where I might be in better physical shape but where my knees are decidedly worse. I'm not sure if I like the tradeoff but I suppose everything in life involves a tradeoff of sorts.I've been told that running on the treadmill (aka, the ""dreadmill"") is better on your knees, but I hate the gym, always have, and running on a treadmill is about as interesting to me as studying the gravel in my front yard, which is to say, not very.I have long been a fan of Murakami's fiction, but I put off reading this because I assumed it was something that would only interest runners. As a result then of my newfound interest in running, I finally picked it up. Nothing contained here though is inaccessible to a non-runner. For Murakami, running is essentially a sort of meditative process, albeit one that offsets the many hours he spends sitting in a chair writing and helps him stay in shape.It's a good read, filled with insight into Murakami's writing and thought process. It left me with a better understanding of the man and the reasoning behind why so many run in the first place.I recommend you add ""What I Talk About When I Talk About Running"" to your list for 2019, even if running doesn't make it onto your list of resolutions for the New Year."
212,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66540069-seth,Rating 3 out of 5,"I have been running now for a little over a year and have managed to lose a little under five stone in weight. In that time I've almost exclusively run alone (bar the odd Saturday morning parkrun) and so I picked up this book to gain some light hearted insight into the reasoning one of my favourite authors has for their own running. I don't know if Murakami still runs (I'd like to if anyone does), but I'd imagine that if he doesn't, the itch and unfortunate regret at not doing so still occasionally rears its head. Ive reached nowhere near the level he has with running, yet I found his reasoning to be much the same as my own. Bar bouts of injury or life circumstances I try to run everyday and have only recently been questioning why I'm bothering at all. I have stumbled (slowly) upon the answer which is that, bar the great mental and physical health benefits, I've found that the regime and consistent requirement I've fallen into has become somewhat addictive. There is something to be said for drumming into yourself the need to do something you don't want to do. Murakami notes a great adage about the typewriter and word counts which I thought was so apt. Plus the tangible self improvement is nice too...The obvious parallel between writing and running seems to lie in solitude. Solitude (for better or worse) and the sheer amount of time and effort required to achieve a single, finished product. Hours spent alone with nothing much to think about bar, well, whatever you want to think about. Some days when writing I feel like Murakami himself and some days when I'm running I feel like Eliud Kipchoge (for a few hundred yards). What I'm trying to say is I think the enjoyment of it for me is in the small moments of elation and the knowledge that they're fleeting and are not guaranteed to come about any time soon. When running I mostly just feel okay, and don't think about very much at all like Murakami says, but when I feel great I bottle it and (much like in my writing) try and replicate it the next day.Hopefully like the author I can look back on this review In a few years time with fond memories of my year running. Perhaps I'll still be at it, perhaps not. If I am, hopefully I'll re-read this book with a little more experience and insight and find something new that I didn't grasp this time around. Happy running! 🏃"

I run for 40 minutes or so starting from my home into these awe-inspiring landscapes which would run into subsequent villages, and then I would walk all the way back home. I abdicated whole of this idea of running once summer’s scorching temperatures arrived. Eighteen months later, now, I resumed my daily running and running everyday ever since I finished reading this 180 paged Murakami’s-smallest-book-till-date. No kidding. And I surmise running is never the same after reading this book, because you start to see everything in new light while you run, say that dewy grass, placid lake, foggy trees, curved path, sometimes mucky rain water, cancerous suburbs, pleasant farmland, soiled land and even anxious wild-centipede crossing the road, all of which were there earlier too, but I never cared noticed. Now i'm enjoying them.You just love the way Murakami puts these little things and philosophy into your mind and you can’t stop recollecting them while you are running. Have you ever run while it’s pouring down heavily? Or have you ever tried a beer just after finishing your v.long run? Now these kind of small discoveries are what you make along with running once you finish reading this book. But what I despised most about the book was demise of this interesting philosophy in running or its bond with his writing to the flat notes on few of the marathons he attended in 23 years. It just starts to get on your nerve when he starts to explain about these triathlons he started to participate lately. It just cost you one star Murakami.Murakami was 33 when he started running and he continues it till date he is 64 now.  He ran marathons every year, triathlons once in a while and meanwhile he wrote some great books. So here is the bottom line. Pain is inevitable, suffering is optional.  That’s the effing light at the end of the effing tunnel. Now go get your shoes already!  "

Chưa bao giờ đọc tiểu thuyết của Haruki nhưng đọc quyển này cũng hiểu được vì sao tác phẩm của ông thu hút và sức viết của ông thật đáng kinh ngạc, chính là do sự nghiêm túc của ông với rèn luyện sức khỏe, cụ thể là chạy bộ.Tâm trạng của người chạy bộ được miêu tả nhiều xuyên suốt quyển tự truyện.""Mọi người đôi khi cười khẩy những người chạy bộ mỗi ngày, tuyên bố là họ sẽ làm bất cứ gì có thể để sống thọ hơn. Nhưng tôi không nghĩ đó là lí do hầu hết người ta chạy. Hầu hết những người chạy bộ chạy ko phải vì họ muốn sống lâu hơn, mà vì họ muốn sống trọn vẹn. Ngay cả khi ta chỉ định sống cho qua ngày đoạn tháng thì vẫn tốt hơn nhiều nếu sống những năm tháng ấy với những mục tiêu rõ ràng và sống động trọn vẹn thay vì bối rối hoang mang, và tôi tin chạy bộ giúp chúng ta làm được điều đó. Cố gắng tối đa trong những giới hạn cá nhân của mình: đó là bản chất của chạy bộ, và là một ẩn dụ cho cuộc sống - cho tôi, và cả cho viết lách. Tôi tin rằng nhiều người chạy sẽ tán thành.""Chạy bộ là một hành vi kì lạ. Thật tình mà nói nó không chứa sự hấp dẫn như những môn thể thao khác. Nó là một quá trình mài dũa thể lực và ý chí con người thì đúng hơn. Trong một buổi tập thể thao, ta có thường 2 kiểu: một là tập cho vui, hai là rèn luyện. Chạy bộ chắc chắn là kiểu thứ hai. Cái cảm giác chân mỏi, miệng khô, ngực thở dốc, áo ướt đẫm một mình trên đường thật khó tả. Mà cảm giác này, dù ít nhiều tùy thời điểm, đều xuất hiện trong tất cả buổi chạy.Tác dụng đầu tiên của chạy bộ là đạt được sự rỗng không. Đầu óc ta hầu như không suy nghĩ gì hết, rất chánh niệm. Chạy bộ, cũng như những môn vận động khác, giúp xả stress ngay từ những bước chân đầu tiên. Nhưng tác dụng lớn nhất của chạy bộ nằm ở đằng sau buổi chạy. Tâm trí bình thản hơn, hệt như lúc chạy.Cách viết của Haruki trầm tĩnh, khiêm nhường và lãng đãng buồn. Ẩn chứa trong đó, lại là một tinh thần sắc đá.“Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional. Say you’re running and you think, ‘Man, this hurts, I can’t take it anymore. The ‘hurt’ part is an unavoidable reality, but whether or not you can stand anymore is up to the runner himself.”"

Knygutė maža - vos 200 puslapių, bet joje galite išsamiau ir asmeniškiau pažinti rašytoją Haruki Murakami. Iki šiol mažai rodęsis viešojoje erdvėje ir vengęs dėmesio, rašytojas sulaužo tylą ir per ramią bei gilią bėgimo refleksiją atskleidžia save.Jei iki šiol Murakami žinojome kaip puikų rašytoją, šiek tiek erotiškos muzikinės atmosferos kūrėją bei surealių scenarijų kūrėją, tai ši knyga yra visiškai nauja kryptis jo kūryboje. Čia jis kalba apie save. Atskleidžia savo mąstymą, suvokimą ir gyvenimą per bėgiko vaidmenį. Taigi ką mąsto didysis Murakami? Kaip jam sekasi bėgti šimtą kilometrų? Kokiomis mantromis jis užkalba savo bėgamus maratonus?Tikiu, kad knyga suintriguos ir sudomins visus Murakami fanus, norinčius apie jį sužinoti daugiau, bet jei nors šiek tiek esatę susijęs su bėgimu - ši knyga jums bus puikus desertas. Nebėkite jos puslapiais. Skaitykite lėtai ir mėgaukitės. Lygiai taip pat kaip bėgate. Gero kelio ir skaitymo."

And I liked his way of being open and modest at the same time, sharing his fears and struggles. I can’t deny that I really enjoyed this one (I’m even considering picking another book by him! Unbelievable!). Maybe because this year I don’t feel like being that much into novels but more into essays, memoirs,... the facts.. This year I feel strangely close to the end that I need to read about real stuff more than before... about life, you know... I especially loved how he bridged between running and writing. That how not paying attention to your body would affect and even ruin your career (Other jobs that involve long hours of sitting-at-desk would share the same danger).This was a great book to listen to while knitting! Especially putting it on 2x speed, helped me speed up! Now what other similar stuff to pick after? Hm... That’s the question of the day."
219,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/118350653-luciana,Rating 4 out of 5,"A proposta desse pequeno livro de Murakami é bem simples: como a corrida e a literatura são vistas e vivenciadas pelo escritor, que não pode se desassociar de nenhuma das duas, pois, uma é equivalente à outra, já que o escritor se exercita para que possa continuamente escrever mais.Com um relato bastante honesto de sua vida como maratonista, Murakami narra em especial o período de 2005-2006 quando se propõe, uma vez mais, correr a maratona de New York e de Boston, passando desde as suas motivações, sua forma de ver o esporte e claro, com excelentes passagens acerca de como isso influencia sua escrita e seu processo criativo, além de também discorrer de seu início na literatura e suas impressões ao longo do tempo.É, portanto, uma obra sobre correr, sobre literatura e sobre Murakami. A quem gosta de uma dessas coisas, certamente gostará do romance. A mim, foi uma boa leitura, Murakami tem como meta correr uma maratona todo ano, e eu tenho a de lê-lo ao menos uma vez ao ano. Acho que nós dois estamos conseguindo cumprir nossas metas."

I'm not saying this is the best book ever, because that is definitely not true; in fact I liked ""Norwegian Wood"" or ""Kafka on the Shore"" (I have only started reading books by him very recently) much more. Still, this book talks about the humane part of the writer, talks about personal struggle and happiness of small achievements set by oneself, and most importantly about sticking to a decision once fixed by someone. I could not help being more motivated and determined about doing things that I have planned for myself. Overall, I must agree with the review by Independent of Sunday, ""This charming little book is a winner from start to finish"". :) "

I did enjoy it, as it was super interesting to get some insight into the mind of my favourite author, but it fell a little flat for me. The observations made about running, writing and life were really great. With all of Murakami's other books, I'm amazed by the natural flow of the writing. This book felt a little more disjointed, it was slightly harder to follow the train of thought. There were odd times where he would jump to talking about something else and it always threw me off. Overall I did enjoy this book! I definitely prefer Murakami's fiction writing. I just joined the gym though and this was a strangely motivating little book. "

I don’t know why I feel both happy and lucky while reading anything for him.He’s such a skillful writer who puts a lot of passion into his books and forces the reader to crave for more. That’s a true gift.In this book, he didn’t talk about running (the sport) as much as he talked about it as a writing agitator. Running for Murakami was the food of his creativity. That’s why the reader must not think that he or she should be interested in running in order to enjoy the book. Running (the sport) is irrelevant. You can replace it with whatever sport or hobby you like and still get to enjoy and love the book.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

It helped immensely in getting to know the writer better for who he is today with a little glimpse into his ordinary life. Murakami here talks about his outlook in life while unduly talking about the essence of running and marathons ; how it made him get better, push his limits and mostly always endure the utter joy as the afterglow. And with those personal stories he shared in the book, I ended up liking him more. Ps-This is a must must-read for anyone who has dearly enjoyed Murakami’s work."

Nie všetci sú totiž stvorení na beh na dlhé trate a uvedomuje si to aj Haruki Murakami, ktorého bežecký memoár som čítala v novembri. Siahla som po ňom, pretože ho odporúčal Robert Vlach v knihe Na voľnej nohe. Vraj v ňom nepíše len o behaní, ale je to dobrá motivácia pre freelancerov. Takto ju vám chcem odporučiť aj ja.„Väčšina bežcov nebeží preto, že by chceli žiť dlhšie, ale preto, že chcú žiť svoj život tak, aby za niečo stál. Myslím si, že je oveľa lepšie prežiť ho s konkrétnym cieľom, než ho premárniť nudou.“Tento citát sa dá aplikovať na akúkoľvek aktivitu, ktorá človeka napĺňa, a dúfam, že sa v roku 2024 stane mojím krédom, nielen pracovným, ale aj voľnočasovým.Haruki Murakami v tejto kratučkej knihe rozpráva o svojich bežeckých zážitkoch, o tom, ako a prečo sa stal spisovateľom, a čo táto práca od neho vyžaduje, a hlavne o tom, čo zahŕňa taká príprava na jeden jesenný maratón. Zbožňujem sledovať, čítať či počúvať o ľuďoch, ktorí niečo robia, vedia, prečo to robia, a robia to dobre.Keď som bola malá, mala som milión koníčkov, a to už aj vtedy existovali sociálne siete, ktoré by ma mohli rozptyľovať. Aj napriek tomu som si vždy našla čas venovať sa tomu, čo mám rada. Čím som však staršia, tým je náročnejšie nájsť zmysel v takýchto koníčkoch. Človek chce byť buď neustále produktívny, alebo chce svoj mozog zasypávať okamžitým prívalom dopamínu. Aspoň takto pesimisticky občas vidím svoj dospelácky pracovný život. Rovnováha medzi prácou a voľným časom je pre mňa stále záhadou, no je úžasné inšpirovať sa od iných, ako je napríklad v tomto prípade svetoznámy spisovateľ (a bežec) Haruki Murakami."
234,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61988730-elo-maria,No Rating,"Hästi mõnna teetassi taga lugemise raamat. Ja Murakami kirjutab ikka nii hästi! Isegi täiesti tavalistest asjadest, nagu see, kuidas ta iga päev jooksmas käib.Sometimes I run fast when I feel like it, but if I increase the pace I shorten the amount of time I run, the point being to let the exhilaration I feel at the end of each run carry over to the next day. This is the same sort of tack I find necessary when writing a novel. I stop every day right at the point where I feel I can write more. Do that, and the next day's work goes surprisingly smoothly.If they were to make a movie about my life I just the thought of which scares me), these would be the scenes they'd leave on the cutting-room floor. ""we can leave this episode out,"" the editor would explain. ""it's not bad, but it's sort of ordinary and doesn't amount to much."" Those kinds of memories unpretentious, commonplace. But for me, they're all meaningful and valuable. As each of these memories flits across my mind, I'm sure I unconsciously smile, or give a slight frown. Commonplace they might be, but the accumulation of these memories has led to one result: me.In the novelist's profession, as far as I'm concerned, there's no such thing as winning or losing. Maybe numbers of copies sold, awards won, and critics' praise serve as outward standards for accomplishment in literature, but none of them really matter. What's crucial is whether your writing attains the standards you've set for yourself. Failure to reach that bar is not something you can easily explain away. When it comes to other people, you can always come up with a reasonable explanation, but you can't fool yourself. In this sense, writing novels and running full marathons are very much alike.In other words, you can't please everybody.Even when I run my bar I followed the same policy. A lot of customers come to the bar. If one out of ten enjoyed the place and said he'd come again, that was enough. If one out of ten was a repeat customer, then the business would survive. To put it the other way, it didn't matter if nine out of ten didn't like my bar. This realization lifted a weight off my shoulders. Still, I had to make sure that the one person who did like the place really liked it.But I don't think it's merely willpower that makes you able to do something. The world isn't that simple. To tell the truth, I don't even think there's that much correlation between my running every day and whether or not I have a strong will. I think I've been able to run for more than twenty years for a simple reason: it suits me. Or at least I don't find it all that painful. Human beings naturally continue doing things they like, and they don't continue what they don't like. Admittedly, something close to will does play a small part in that. But no matter how strong a will a person has, no matter how much he may hate to lose, if it's an activity he doesn't really care for, he won't keep it up for long. Even if he did, it wouldn't be good for him.Even now, whenever I run a marathon my mind goes through the same exact process. Up to nineteen miles I'm sure I can run a good time, but past twenty-two miles I run out of fuel and start to get upset at everything. And at the end I feel like a car that's run out of gas. But after I finish and some time has passed, I forget all the pain and misery and am already planning how I can run an even better time in the next race. The funny thing is, no matter how much experience I have under my belt, no matter how old I get, it's all just a repeat of what came before.Running every day is a kind of lifeline for me, so I'm not going to lay off or quit because I'm busy. If I used being busy as an excuse not to run, I'd never run again. I have only a few reasons to keep on running and a truckload of them to quit. All I can do is to keep those few reasons nicely polished.To deal with something unhealthy, a person needs to be as healthy as possible. That's my motto. In other words, an unhealthy soul requires a healthy body.“When I’m in Japan I rarely have to speak in front of people. I don’t give any talks. In English, though, I’ve given a number of talks, and I expect that, if the opportunity arises, I’ll give more in the future. It’s strange, but when I have to speak in front of an audience, I find it more comfortable to use my far-from-perfect English than Japanese. I think this is because when I have to speak seriously about something in Japanese I’m overcome with the feeling of being swallowed up in a sea of words. There’s an infinite number of choices for me, infinite possibilities. As a writer, Japanese and I have a tight relationship. So if I’m going to speak in front of an undefined large group of people, I grow confused and frustrated when faced by that teeming ocean of words.With Japanese, I want to cling, as much as I can, to the act of sitting alone at my desk and writing. On this home ground of writing I can catch hold of words and context effectively, just the way I want to, and turn them into something concrete. That’s my job, after all. But once I try to actually speak about things I was sure I’d pinned down, I feel very keenly that something—something very important—has spilled out and escaped. And I just can’t accept that sort of disorienting estrangement.Once I try to put together a talk in a foreign language, though, inevitably my linguistic choices and possibilities are limited: much as I love reading books in English, speaking in English is definitely not my forte. But that makes me feel all the more comfortable giving a speech. I just think, It’s a foreign language, so what’re you going to do? This was a fascinating discovery for me. Naturally it takes a lot of time to prepare. Before I get up on stage I have to memorize a thirty- or forty-minute talk in English. If you just read a written speech as is, the whole thing will feel lifeless to the audience. I have to choose words that are easy to pronounce so people can understand me, and remember to get the audience to laugh to put them at ease. I have to convey to those listening a sense of who I am. Even if it’s just for a short time, I have to get the audience on my side if I want them to listen to me. And in order to do that, I have to practice the speech over and over, which takes a lot of effort. But there’s also the payoff that comes with a new challenge."""

238,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13014473-greg,Rating 3 out of 5,"I think I'm hitting my GoodReads ""reviewing"" wall because I can't seem to come up with anything interesting to say about books these days. It's all, ""I loved Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore, but did you watch Homeland last night?"" Or, ""what did you think of Heat? Shut up, I'm listening to Babel."" Or the worst one of all, ""What did I think about the Murakami memoir? I'll just ignore you because I'm going to watch Cloud Atlas"", which as a book I've started and stopped about 20 million times already (only a very slight exaggeration) and I bought the motherfucker in hardback when it first came out. So what did I think of What I Talk About When I Talk About Running? Umm...Hmmm...Murakami is a great writer, kind of sounds like a dick though, an uncompromising dick though. I hate when people talk about how you'll only enjoy something if you have a preexisting interest in its subject matter. I'm sorry, but that's bullshit. If you can't get it up for running or ballet or supply-side economics or killer robots or cancer just because it doesn't interest you, you need to dream a little bigger, darling. I'm not saying you're not allowed to have an aversion to a certain genre, but come up with a better reason than it doesn't interest me. I won't go near horror, but that's because I'm a pansy-ass control freak that doesn't like having nightmares about killer clowns coming out of the shower drain and stabbing me to death (I swear I didn't make that up, it was on TV when I was a wee child and that shit still makes me check the drain pipes before I take a shower, y'know, just in case). This has been a long-winded message brought to you by: Don't not read Running just because you have no interest in running. Don't read it if you don't like Murakami, or think running writers sound oxymoronic, like Hell's Angels or Microsoft Works.I happen to run and thought it might be interesting to read about running from an amateur's perspective. I'm not a good runner. I did run for an hour just before I finished this book (yes, I'm bragging), but I'm a bad runner. Murakami actually doesn't really sound like an amateur here, with all his talk of times and running down opponents and flipping them the bird (that didn't happen? oh, that was just me then), but I think any sport breaks down into beginners, amateurs, serious people, pro-amateurs, and pro-pros. Murakami is a serious runner and Running is a serious account of what he thinks about running. The writing has incredible ease and flow that only comes after umpteenth million drafts, but what stuck out to me was its honesty. Murakami is not a persona here, this sounds like a simple, direct self-portrait, scabs and all. He doesn't draw attention to his flaws (well, he does say twice that most people wouldn't like him, but that's more general), he just presents himself as truthfully as possible and doesn't give a fuck if you like him or not. I love that. I still think he sounds like a prick, but I fully admit that I'm probably a prick as well so I'm no great judge of character. The flow is nice, with subtle transitions back and forth between running, writing, and aging like a three-partner dance. Fatigue did start to set in with the running passages. They have a repetition that seems right when talking about running, but they just blurred together after a while. I had one big problem with the flow and that has to do with the New York Marathon. He keeps us informed about the training up to and including the preparation to the race, but then ends the chapter on a cliffhanger, skips ahead months in time and starts up a new topic, only coming back to tell us about the marathon after a couple pages. I really could not think of a good reason why he did this. Leave us hanging? Build suspense? Possible, but this is a short book that's heavy on philosophy, but light on plot, so to try and build suspense is stupid. "

""Most runners run not because they want to live longer, but because they want to live life to the fullest. If you're going to while away the years, it's far better to live them with clear goals and fully alive then in a fog, and I believe running helps you to do that.""
Running is an odd thing to be passionate about if you think about it rationally. It's repetitive, it's effortful and it's time consuming. But fellow runners will know that nothing else compares to it. What I Talk about When I Talk about Running is Murakami's way of putting into words what he has felt about running for years, since starting with a daily run of 10km that lead him to running a marathon every year, participating in an ultra-marathon (100km) and multiple triathlons. People run for different reasons: some to keep fit, some to lose or keep weight, but most will agree that it's hard to stop once you start. I wholeheartedly agree. And I love talking to people who feel the same way as I do, hearing their stories and experiences, which is why I picked up this book. Turns out I both could and couldn't relate to Murakami. We both share the determination and the knowledge that we will keep running for the rest of our days, may it be for better or worse. While I enjoy the independency of the sport, it's Murakami's way to keep himself writing: it helps him focussing. An interesting perspective. 
""I'm often asked what I think about as I run. Usually the people who ask this have never run long distances themselves. I always ponder the question. What exactly do I think about when I'm running? I don't have a clue.""
Underneath all of this, there's a certain sadness though. I'd say this memoir is as much about writing and running as it is about growing older, an inevitability that I personally think a lot about. Murakami talks about the changes he can feel in his physicality, the fact that his running will keep changing (for the worse) with his growing age. There's acceptance and appreciation in his words, but I was left with a bittersweet feeling. This book is certainly an inspiring read for runners and Murakami fans alike. It was unfamiliar, thus funny, seeing his writing style and way of twisting and forming words applied to a personal story instead of his stories of magical realism and while his personal story didn't inspire me the way it did other readers, I surely don't regret having picked this memoir up.
""All I do is keep on running in my own cozy, homemade void, my own nostalgic silence. And this is a pretty wonderful thing. No matter what anybody else says.""

I was passionate about it. I even ran a marathon! I used running during a terrible time in my life as a form of escape and it made me a better person. Sadly, I then got injured, and with injury came frustration, and after months of frustration and pain I just gave up. That was five years ago.I have wanted to start running again almost since I stopped, but I know over the past five years I have fallen deeply out of shape, and that old injury will probably never go away entirely. I will be starting from square one. Mile zero. In fact, I am in even worse shape than I was when I started running in the first place. This book brought all of the things I adore about running back. The feeling of accomplishment. The feeling of freedom that comes after a solid few kms when your muscles relax and you feel like you could run forever. The emotions that come from running races and seeing other people push themselves.So, I have dug out my old runners (the same pair I ran that marathon in) and tomorrow morning I am going to go for a run. It will be slow, it will not feel good, but I will take my time and do it. And then again the next day. And the next.If you need some inspiration for life, whether that be physical, creative, or mental, this collection of essays had me invested and is probably the best non-fiction book I have ever read.

245,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/318324-kurt,Rating 3 out of 5,"I began long distance running on November 11, 2000, at the age of 41. Since then I have run nearly 10000 miles and participated in 2 marathons and dozens of half marathons, 10Ks, and 5Ks. Running has become a bit of an obsession for me. It is something that I generally don't talk about with non runners except in very general terms. But when I talk about running with other runners -- those whom I know share, or at least understand, my obsession -- the talk often becomes alive and animated.Haruki Murakami shares my passion for running. He is generally regarded as Japan's greatest living author and is certainly the most well-known Japanese author in the Western world. I've read exactly one of his novels, Norwegian Wood, whose first chapter struck me as a brilliant emotive description of one man's nostalgia for a past love. So when I found out that Murakami is also a runner who has even written a memoir on the subject, I pretty much had to read it.A good book with a fair amount of insightful musings about running, and quite a bit about dealing with and accepting the inevitable aging process. People who have a reasonable amount of experience with long distance running will enjoy and appreciate this book."

I set a timer for 20 minutes and ran every other day. That doesn’t sound like a long time, especially when you consider that Murakami ran an ultramarathon, but for me it hurt like hell.I proofread my novel-in-progress in a similar manner to the way I ran. I set a 10 minute timer and proofread the book in two 10-minute stretches every day.What am I training for? I’m training for the marathon that is my life. I want to be thinner. I want to be more disciplined. And I want a novel that is long and lean and built to last like a marathon runner.Perhaps the only way to do that is to run every day...to read every day...to proofread every day...to revise every day...but most importantly to hurt every day."

This book is very much him talking about running. And training. And rest. And mental and physical obstacles. Parts of it are almost diary form. I was constantly reminded of my husband’s favorite quote.That said, it was not a bad thing at all. I really enjoyed his thoughts. The book was the perfect length (a little over 4 hours), so it didn’t get repetitive or monotonous. It was very insightful.

Naime, u trideset i trećoj godini života, poznati pisac napušta džez bar koji je vodio i odlučuje da se oproba kao profesionalni pisac. Kako pisanje, prema njegovom mišljenju, nije isključivo intelektualni već i zahtjevan fizički posao koji, između ostalog, podrazumijeva i sposobnost koncentracije i usamljenost, Murakami bira trčanje kao aktivnost koja će mu omogućiti ne samo kvalitetnu tjelesnu pripremu za napore pisanja nego i određenu pisalačku filozofiju (ako se može tako reći). Autor ove biografije objašnjava da ne trči da bi duže živio ili bilo šta slično nego da dok živi bude produktivniji pisac, ali i čovjek kome starost neće bitnije poremetiti, što bi rekli ljekari, kvalitet života. Za njega trčanje takođe nije značajno kao takmičarska aktivnost (osim što je potpuno svjestan svojih mogućnosti, nema pobjedničke ambicije) već isključivo kao borba sa samim sobom i stalno ispitivanje sopstvenih granica. Iako je svoje tijelo često izlagao ogromnim pritiscima namjerno završavajući na ivici svijesti i iako bi se po okončanju trke i postignutom cilju radovao što više ne mora da trči, nikad nije pomislio da prestane. Jedna od beneficija trčanja je i to što tad često ne misli ni o čemu već uživa upravo u toj praznini misli.Otkad je počeo, Murakami trči jedan maraton godišnje, najčešće zimi (ponekad i dva), a poslije nekoliko godina počinje praktikovati i triatlon kao dio svojih ljetnjih sadržaja. Zanimljivo je spomenuti da je istrčao i jedan ultramaraton (100 km) kao i činjenicu da je sam samcat otišao u samu kolijevku maratona i istrčao u suprotnom smjeru (od Atine do Maratona). Posebno je fascinantno sa koliko skromnosti piše o svemu.Inače, volim pisce i uopšte ljude koji pričaju o nečemu krajnje ozbiljno, bez namjere da budu duhoviti, a zapravo izazovu u vama salve smijeha. Taman i po cijenu kad su oni zaista i ozbiljni i ne razumiju čemu se vi smijete. U jednom trenutku sam se doslovno zacrvenila pred knjigom jer mi se učinilo da sam vidjela Murakamija kako me gleda, nakon pretrčanih 35 kilometara, gotovo iznemogao. Postidila sam se, ali mi je svejedno u nekim dijelovima bio vrlo smiješan.Kao neko ko se godinama na neki način bavio sportom i bio (radno i intelektualno) najefikasniji upravo u vrijeme pune fizičke snage, mogu samo da se divim ljudima koji su ovoliko samodisciplinovani i istrajni. Isto tako, kao neko ko nikad ništa nije dobio na lijepe oči već samo mukotrpnim radom i odricanjem (podnijevši mnogo onoga što ekonomisti zovu oportunitetni trošak), te kao neko ko je isto tako sklon debljanju, savršeno shvatam stalni rad ne samo na održavanju forme i mišića, već uopšte nivoa radne (profesionalne) aktivnosti. Biti dugoprugaš znači ulagati u život na duge staze. Moram izraziti i svoje oduševljenje na njegovoj hrabrosti da jednog dana, tek tako, odluči da se posveti karijeri pisca i s te strane mi je drago što mu se rizik isplatio. Mogla sam umjesto svega što sam napisala jednostavno staviti da ova knjiga, odnosno Murakamijev život, potvrđuje dvije velike istine, a to su da sreća prati hrabre i u zdravom tijelu zdrav duh :) Ipak, zamjeram mu jednu stvar, ali to ću zadržati za sebe i negdje mi je žao što razmišlja o tome da li je sve ovo što radi (trčanje) besmisleno. Osim što želi svaku trku da istrči do kraja, drugi, ništa manje važan, cilj (ali i izazov) mu je da ne hoda tokom trke. Volio bi da njegov epitaf glasi ""... barem nije hodao do kraja."""

(That’s my man. ;) Anyways, as a non-fiction book, it’s just as versatile as Hemingway’s A Moveable Feast, which is probably my favourite piece of non-fiction ever. In each chapter a different race, a different mistake, a different goal, or a different comment is discussed, and at no point does it feel bland, repetitive or even boring. There is something so whimsical, powerful and simply hypnotising about someone just talking about what they’re passionate about, that the words flow by themselves. It was almost effortless to read.
“Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional. [...] The hurt part is an unavoidable reality, but whether or not you can stand anymore is up to the runner himself.”
I listened to at least half of this book while Running. I’ve run regularly since my teen years, and though I loved the sport beforehand, this book has made me remember all my triumphs and pains I have dealt with. It made me love this sport even more, it reinforced it to me. Now that it’s summer and I have the time, I run every other day between 30 to 90 minutes, and this book made me want to go even further. It’s really powerful stuff. It failed to make me a junkie-runner, but it is clearly stated at the forward that this isn’t this book’s purpose.
“For me, running is both exercise and a metaphor. Running day after day, piling up the races, bit by bit I raise the bar, and by clearing each level I elevate myself. At least that’s why I’ve put in the effort day after day: to raise my own level. I’m no great runner, by any means. I’m at an ordinary – or perhaps more like mediocre – level. But that’s not the point. The point is whether or not I improved over yesterday. In long-distance running the only opponent you have to beat is yourself, the way you used to be.”
And, lastly, I’d like to mention that this book is so quotable is ridiculous. I’ll read his Rat Trilogy during the autumn for sure.
- Murakami after completing his first Marathon, in the Greek town of Marathon. [Picture taken by Masao Kageyama]My recommendations for reading after this book are:- A Moveable Feast, by Ernest Hemingway [amazing non-fiction book]- The Great Gatsby, by F. Scott Fitzgerald [no questions asked]And here I’d include some Raymond Carver, but I haven’t read any of his (I’m dying to). What We Talk About When We Talk About Love, inspired this book’s title, so I guess, go for that."

262,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2426275-columbusreads,Rating 3 out of 5,"My three big passions are running, jazz and reading and they rank so closely together that the order changes depending on how I feel at any given time. So, when I heard that writer, jazz aficionado and distance runner, Haruki Murakami (a former Jazz club owner in Japan) had published a memoir about his love for running, I couldn't wait to read it. Well, I started this book several years ago and for some reason after reading several chapters, the excitement I had built up just wasn't there for me. I picked it up again a week ago and just finished it yesterday. Well, there are some wonderfully insightful passages in the book about running and his writing life and how he balances the two. But, for the most part it's a little humdrum. Don't get me wrong, the writing is excellent as you would expect from him. Writing about these things he's very passionate about, he could like phone most of this in (which he pretty much does). But, the writing or format is not in a linear fashion and makes the reading frustrating for me. An example, he builds you up for this 2005 NYC marathon he's training for, meticulously talking about every detail and his preparation for the race, and then right when it's time to reach the climax he switches to a triathlon race in 2006. Then he goes back to the marathon two chapters later almost like he never left it. Huh! He does this throughout the book and it's so irritating and frustrating to me. However, I will certainly take this book any day over the one fiction book I read of his. I'm still working my way through 1Q84 over 2 years later. Can you say War and Peace redux!"
263,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1899836-snotchocheez,Rating 4 out of 5,"To be honest, I have zero interest in running; I just read this to perhaps get a voyeuristic glimpse into the brain of someone who consistently pens enjoyable off-kilter contemporary fiction: to see what makes Haruki Murakami ""tick"". While he still remains as enigmatic as his fiction (What I Talk About When I Talk About Running is somewhat skimpy on non-running-related aspects of his personal life), the book is still highly enjoyable. He does, in an oblique way, describe how his training regimen (for what amounts to over two decades of distance running competitions, including a few dozen marathons and triathlons, across the globe) correlates with his discipline in writing a novel. It's a lot of fun reading about his having fun doing something he totally enjoys, and almost makes me want to take up running just to see what all the fuss is about. (okay, maybe not, but his obvious love for the sport is infectious). (fun fact that definitely needs expanding upon: In his Afterword, Murakami lists a few fond memories in his (as of the 2007 publish date) two-and-a-half decade-long obsession with running. One of them was a 1983 morning jog/convo around Central Park with John Irving (whose first novel Setting Free the Bears Murakami was translating into Japanese)...how cool would it have been to hear that convo?!?! Alas, Murakami's reticence about the memory (they ""talked about all kinds of things"" while running...like what, Haruki?!? Please enlighten us!!!) only serves to endear me to him, while at the same time reinforces his enigmatic status. Sigh. Guess will have to wait for his tell-all autobiography...probably after he gets this running nonsense behind him.)"

Murakami shares with us diary pages from ten years ago to tell us about his relationship with running, how it shaped his life and how running is inextricably interwoven with writing, how it's the physical manifestation of his personality.I run. Each morning, every single day, I get up at sunrise and go run till the sun comes up. It is my precious ritual, something that I need to do to feel good, to start my day. It is my ""me"" time.So Murakami's words spoke to me like nobody else's. His struggle to get up from bed when he felt too tired but he did it nonetheless for that awesome satisfactionary feeling that inevitably comes afterwards; his preference for solitary activities; the carelessness towards competition, for what matters above anything is reaching the goals that you set for yourself.This is me. This book was me in a non-fiction book form and I couldn't help but love it from start to end.Yes, I'm biased. But. If you love runnning, read this book. If you love Murakami, read this book. If you want to read a non-fiction book with a well crafted prose and short and sweet descriptions, read this book.

265,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4015835-michael,Rating 2 out of 5,"What I Talk About When I Talk About Running is a memoir by Haruki Murakami where he talks about his interest in running. From running for pleasure to competing in over twenty marathons and an ultramarathon. Part training log, travelogue and reminiscence, this is a memoir of Murakami’s passion for running.Now I’m not a runner and I don’t think I ever will be but I like to read about people being passionate about a topic and although this was brief, the passion was not in short supply. Most people know Haruki Murakami for his postmodern novels which include Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World, Norwegian Wood, The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle and 1Q84. This is an unusual memoir, not just because it only focuses on one interest, but because I don’t think any other authors have written something like it.The book tries to explore why he is so passionate about running and why he runs. For a non runner reading this book for its memoir aspects, it’s just interesting the approach he takes. It’s like seeing Murakami’s thought process on the page; not offering tips or anything, just being nostalgic about past runs or discussing plans for a marathon or just tracking his daily runs.For me this is nothing special, but for people obsessed with running this would be an interesting read. I read just to see the passion he has towards running, as well as the fact it was mentioned in Metroland and I want to be a book hipster. I was surprised how well this worked, like a stream of conscious of Haruki Murakami’s love of running.This review originally appeared on my blog; http://literary-exploration.com/2013/..."
266,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14892211,Rating 3 out of 5,"Well,,This is my first reading to Murakami, he is a creative novelist as many said(didn't read any) he is also a great athlete. I did not expect that he started running for long distances ( i am a long distance runner too) when he was 33 Years old. Hmm, yes it's not too late but a bit late. As he claimed, running help him a lot in writing novels and in creating new magnificent narratives, in spotlight of his experience in running/ writing it proved the scientific proof that running helps the brain to release a certain chemical that make the runner feel high ''Runner's High''!! Seems he used to run instead smoking weeds just like other writers or novelist 😬.However, he is not only a regular runner, he just go beyond that to be an ultramarathoner ( he ran for 99 KM long!), another good experience he shared that after he ran for that tough, harsh and insane ultramarathon he felt with something he call it ""Runner's Blue"" that work as resistance to practice running for certain period of time, especially after a harsh run, i really understand him as i felt the same tho 🙂. Another last thing about Murakami, he is a triathlete as well swimming, Cycling, Running) Three leg in one competition, that too much tho, i never expect (may be some) such a novelist involved in such very difficult and harsh sports! But all what led him to do as he said is the passion, or let's say in another word, he did all this stuff to beat the inner Murakami in his innermost.. We all have that inner tiny stinky dwarf in ourselves who prevent us from engaging in challenges, risk or kind of new dangerous adventures. May be we can learn from Murakami how to beat that stinky dwarf 🙂"
267,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/245923-dini,Rating 5 out of 5,"Haruki Murakami can be daunting at times. I've only read a few of his works; some I don't understand (e.g. The Elephant Vanishes, an anthology which I didn't finish) while some I don't really like (Norwegian Wood). But this book I love, because it's understandable (unlike most of his novels, that deal with the surreal) and likeable. In this memoir Murakami does not only discuss his lifelong passion for distance running, but also its relationship with his vocation as a writer and his life as a whole. He gained my greatest respect when he described himself as someone with modest talent, both in writing and running, but who always strives to do his best. He shares about dealing with his shortcomings and growing old, and in the face of all the obstacles he just keeps on going--or running, to be exact. Thanks to this book I have renewed my interest in his works, and it somehow even made me want to put on my shoes and start running. Me, someone who was always among the last to finish during runs at school.Coincidentally, the Japanese boyband member that I like has also written about running in his monthly magazine essay late last year.

Haruki Murakami's memoirs about running and writing. While I said it's motivational, it doesn't read like a how to run or how to write book, it more puts you in a certain mindscape - Murakami's that is....and if you can take something from it and it enlarges your life he would be happy. It made me ""feel good"" about myself, and changed the way I view ""failure"" in sport/exercise & how you gain something new from even the failures. Writers might probably gain some insights about regularity and structure in their lives. While I'm not a writer, I can relate to Murakami's daily routines. It's the daily practice that gets you to the end of the marathon or the end of the book, ditto with any enterprise.Last but not least you find out a little about Murakami's life. Library borrow.(gets precedence since we only get 2 weeks with them).Ironic I am reading this when my foot is still out of action and it's been nearly 2 months since I've done anything but hobble.

I knew from the moment I started, that he was gonna be a favorite for me. Eventhough there wasn‘t a big plot or an exciting storyline to grab onto, the way of putting the words and telling his story, made me sink into each and every page. I also run from time to time (not very often recently)And the things he felt while running in silence were just so accurate for me.On the outside running is just sweating and heavy breathing and sore legs , but it‘s so much more than that.I wish I could have a conversation with him about this passion that we share and the meaning it has:))He reminded me why I love to run so much."

I know that writing novels is different, but I am really encouraged to read his novels more than before.This book is more a memoir than biography book as he described it himself, he talked about his life before his decision to devote himself to writing, his daily routine in his Jazz bar compared to his daily routine as a full time writer.One important lesson to be learned is that focus is the way to achieve any success.He talked about his experience as a runner, difficulties he had faced, bad and good times, what running meant to him, and very inspiring talks about running.Before listening, I was a bit worried that talking about running only would fill a full book, but as a talented writer, he managed to add and mix ideas to introduce a balanced meal."

It's way too specific and longwinded for a non-runner to appreciate. Here's my gripe: he's WAY too wrapped up in times and doesn't seem to enjoy long-distance running for the sake of it. For instance, he plans to run the NYC marathon one year and his goals are 1) to finish 2) to NEVER walk, only run and 3) to enjoy himself. Sorry, but I think that's crazy! Who cares if you walk for a bit? And enjoying himself is only 3rd. Hmmm....Obviously my running style differs.

Na niecałych dwustu stronach japoński pisarz pozwala zajrzeć czytelnikowi wgłąb siebie, swoich motywacji i uczuć. Dowiadujemy się co czuje przed startami, jak jego podejście do sportu zmieniało się przez lata i co właściwie daje mu bieganie długich dystansów. Murakami w posłowiu pisze, że “O czym mówię...”, nie jest autobiografią, ale czytając o czynności, która od tylu lat wypełnia mu tak dużą część życia, nie sposób nie ulec wrażeniu, że poznajemy go bardzo dobrze. Jest w tym pewna intymność, gdy opowiada o bólu i niepewności, o potrzebie założenia co rano adidasów i ruszenia w drogę, o coraz słabszych wynikach, które przychodzą z wiekiem pomimo wzmożonych wysiłków włożonych w treningi…Czy książka zainteresuje “niebiegaczy”?

I am dedicated to the things I love. I’m very critical of myself and fear the decline of the body that comes with age.I found this to be somewhat inspiring, but also depressing. It’s not really an inspirational read, but more a realistic observation about life and the hard truths of dedicating yourself to a pursuit."
299,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2422229-joe-kraus,Rating 2 out of 5,"I ought to be the target audience for this. I very much admire Murakami and have read most of his novels. I’m also a fairly committed runner and triathlete, the subjects of his meditations in this journal-like collection of essays he wrote over about a year and a half in the middle 2000s.And yet, this one really falls flat. There’s little sustained self-exploration: we get, for instance, the now famous declaration that he was watching a baseball game (he names the exact player at-bat) when he suddenly decided he could write a novel. He’d been running a jazz club – something that comes, again, with little detail – and then he decided that’s what he’d do. He wrote it, sent it out, and won a contest. If it was really that easy, then I hate him. (Maybe that’s how many small-college basketball players feel about Lebron James, but still…) If it was more complicated, as I am certain it was, then it shows him dodging some of the real material on the table.The sustained problem here is the banality. Murakami doesn’t censor his observations – it made him happy to run past a beautiful woman on Cambridge mornings, or he counsels high school gym coaches against insisting all students should run the same distance – which generally means that he doesn’t pursue any either. There’s no thesis here, no center. There isn’t even a clear narrative, since he begins by talking about distance running, with a sort of goal at the New York City marathon, and then he goes on a long tangent about bike and swimming training for unrelated triathlons. He essentially compiles a series of reflections he wrote every week or so over the period.As I reflect on this, I’m reminded of Murakami’s particular genius. His best work is filled with banality, with individuals in the midst of daily transactions with nothing spectacular about them. What makes Murakami special is two-fold, though. First, he has a gift for creating characters who are just mildly out of step with such everyday rhythms. They typically seem to fit in well and only slowly discover their own “strangeness.”In that light, “normal,” is a fundamental concept for him. There’s always a sense of how things should be, of how people should act, but his characters gradually become estranged from it.Second, and even more memorably, he has a gift for excavating a space beneath the normal. His characters descend, often literally, to strange depths of alternate worlds or experiences. He isn’t quite a science fiction or fantasy writer – his work is always anchored in our world – but the cumulative effect of his magical work is to make the ground beneath us seem less solid.Read Hardboiled Wonderland. Read Wind-Up Bird Chronicle. And read 1Q84. Skip this one, though. It has the surface that Murakami punches through in his real and memorable work. Here, though, it remains at that surface, giving us a mostly superficial look at his mid-life experiences as a committed but unspectacular runner."

BUỒN BUỒN KHÔNG CÓ GÌ LÀM LẤY SÁCH RA REVIEW
Tôi nói gì khi nói về chạy bộ (走ることについて語るときに僕の語ること Hashiru koto ni tsuite kataru toki ni boku no kataru koto) tèng teng... một tập văn dạng hồi ký của Murakami núi Phú Sĩ phát hành năm 2007. Chíu chíu....Câu hỏi đặt ra: Liệu có gì chung giữa viết văn và chạy bộ? Một tảng núi văn học đương đại liệu có cần phải dày vò thân xác để đạt đến cõi sâu lắng của tâm hồn. Và thế là bác Murakaki đã quăng 1 chữ CÓ trong phỏng vấn năm 2007. Phong thái của bác từ trả lời, giản dị, tự tin, bằng hành động viết và bằng cuộc sống của chính mình: TẤT CẢ xuất phát từ những bước chân, từ những điều đơn giản rằng ta phải nhanh hơn một tí vào mỗi sáng. Thiên tài văn học xứ Anh Đào, nổi tiếng với Rừng Na Uy, Biên niên ký chim vặn dây cót, Kafka bên bờ biển... bên cạnh khả năng viết xuất chúng ông đã cho chúng ta thấy một người chạy bộ cừ khôi. Trong cuốn sách nhỏ mà thú vị này, bằng giọng văn lôi cuốn, thoải mái nhưng đầy sức mạnh, Murakami kể về quá trình tham gia môn chạy bộ cùng những suy tưởng của ông về ý nghĩa của chạy bộ, và rộng hơn nữa, của vận động cơ thể - sự tuân theo một kỷ luật khắt khe về phương diện thể xác - đối với hoạt động chuyên môn của ông trong tư cách nhà văn. Những nghiền ngẫm của Murakami về sự tương đồng giữa chạy - hành vi thể chất - và viết văn - hành vi tinh thần - thực sự quý báu với những người đọc quan tâm đến văn chương và bản chất của văn chương, đặc biệt người viết trẻ. Còn xét theo khía cạnh sức khỏe và đời sống, chạy giúp cho não lưu thông và tuần hoàn máu. Tăng khả năng suy nghĩ, biện chứng và đặc biệt là trí tưởng tượng. Hãy nghĩ xem với 1 cơ thể tràn trề sinh lực và một cái đầu hoát bát, nhạy bén. Một Murakaki thứ 2 tại Việt Nam là điều hoàn toàn có thể. Hãy cứ chạy đi rồi bạn sẽ thấy.Somerset Maugham từng viết rằng trong mỗi lần cạo râu đều có một triết lý. Tôi hoàn toàn tán thành. Một hành động dù thoạt nhìn có tầm thường đến thế nào, song cứ kiên trì làm đủ lâu thì nó sẽ trở thành một hành vi thâm trầm, thậm chí là thiền định. Vậy thì, với tư cách là một nhà văn, đồng thời với tư cách người chạy bộ, tôi không cho rằng viết và xuất bản một cuốn sách xoay quanh những ý nghĩ riêng tư về chạy bộ sẽ khiến tôi lạc quá xa khỏi lộ trình quen thuộc của mình. Có lẽ tôi chỉ là típ người quá tỉ mỉ, viết ra những ý nghĩ của mình, vậy nên tôi phải thực sự bắt bàn tay mình làm việc và viết những lời này. Nếu không, tôi sẽ không bao giờ hiểu được chạy bộ có ý nghĩa thế nào đối với tôi.Thân ái,______Admin Cuong KhongTôi nói gì khi tôi nói về chạy bộ nàSách chờ bạn đọc tại Sách Chuyền Tay - Books in the City""Cộng đồng mượn sách miễn phí được yêu thích nhất tại Việt Nam"""

If you think about it, it's precisely because people are different from others that they're able to create their own independent selves… emotional hurt is the price a person has to pay in order to be independent.http://sepehrdad.blog.ir/1393/12/08/%..."
303,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/150713783-tia,Rating 3 out of 5,"I thought this memoir was interesting enough to want to finish it - the author himself said it’s kind of a memoir but kind of not, and a collection of essays didn’t do it justice either. I picked this up largely from Ana Wallace Johnson’s booktube video because she said it was one of her favorite motivational nonfiction books.It’s a very analytical and logical (I almost want to say dry) runthrough of his journey as an entrepreneur turned novelist turned long distance runner turned triathloner. Like a lot of the reviews say, it seems like this book resonates a lot more with people who genuinely love to run as a hobby. I myself haven’t tried to run since like 2016, but I wanted to give this a shot since I’ve heard a lot (both good and bad) about his fiction writing and wanted to learn more about the author himself before trying out his work.He chalks up his decisions and action of writing novels and running marathons because.. He just wants to so he does it. I can see how his story is really motivating because it really comes off like he’s just a normal guy. But Murakami made some very weird comments that put me off regarding him noticing attractive young women (aka freshman at the college he lectured at….) running past him. It was mentioned twice I think? Once in the middle and even one at the very end in his author’s note, which I felt was REALLY oddly placed and unnecessary. Like why did he feel like that was so important to mentioned at such a pivotal, closing part of the book. That was weird. I’ve heard Murakami’s fictional writing (again, haven’t read yet myself) comes off as misogynistic so the fact that I actively noticed those comments.. Hmmm.. HMMMMM.. Overall I don’t think I took any sage advice/wisdom from this but I don’t think it was bad. There were a lot of minute details I found like were overkill, but from the reviews it sounds like it resonated with a lot of people - just not a book for me!"
304,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30800-oriana,Rating 3 out of 5,"after reading: Goodness. This was so not what I expected. It truly is a collection of memoir-essays about running, specifically running marathons, with a splish of ultramarathons and triathlons thrown in. He does talk periodically about how running relates to writing, and how each aspect of his life has shaped and informed the other. And there is a smidge about his early, pre-writing life, how he married young and owned a jazz club and all that. But seriously? It's a book about running. So I say again: Goodness. My first thought was that it was a little disappointing, for this absolute giant of literary prowess and intellectual strangeness to be so utterly humanized and normalized, to find that, in part of his mind anyway, running is his first love, and writing second. Then (as another reader on this site mentioned), I thought the whole idea was awfully indulgent, that if he wasn't such a literary superstar, this book would never have even been considered for publication, and no one would have given a shit to read it even if it was put out. But as I kept reading, I was struck over and over again by his absolute sincerity, his total humbleness and earnestness, the simple joy and calmness with which he imparts his thoughts. I can't say that I was moved by the book, really, but it was very sweet. mid-read: I don't know if I maybe thought that the title was a lie, but I have discovered that this is actually, really a book about running. Which, as a very serious not-runner, I admit I am finding a bit off-putting. But nonetheless, I persevere...before reading: Undying thanks to my most unbearably awesome bookfriend Brian for coming through with a proof of this, and sending it across the freaking country for my utterly thrilled (I assume) enjoyment."
305,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26480778-phee,Rating 4 out of 5,"This was a wonderful short book. Not quite a memoir, but much more than a essay collection Murakami takes us through his experience with long distance running. As many of you will know, Haruki Murakami is one of my favourite authors (probably my absolute favourite if I'm completely truthful). His writing speaks to me on so many different levels. His characters and stories are ones that I can read over and over again. He has a magical way of storytelling and is remarkably talented. He can capture everything that I love about Japan in the essence of his words so that when I read them I'm transported back to my happy place. All of that being said I was pretty certain that I wouldn't like this. I can't run. I don't exercise and I hate sports of any kind. Why would I want to read a book about running? Well this book proves that I would read anything that Murakami puts out. It's not just about running. It's about attitudes to life, lessons that he has learnt along the path, the decisions he's made. Sure there is definitely a fair bit of talk about running. But that wasn't boring. Not in the way that Murakami talks about it. I can now appreciate what people who run themselves go through every time they lace up their running shoes. It's not something I can ever see myself doing but I feel like I've gained something from this book. I always feel that way after finishing a Murakami novel though. I'd recommend this to anyone who appreciates Murakami's way with words. And if you are a runner yourself then I think you'll enjoy this all the more. Also major plus points for the Gatsby and Raymond Carver references. I loved it, old sport."

Lần đầu tiên là trong căn phòng nóng hầm hập vào những ngày đợi thi đại học, khi mà não căng ra và ngừng hoạt động vì quá nhiều công thức toán học, thời động từ tiếng Anh cùng biện pháp tu từ ẩn dụ hoán dụ, cuốn Chạy bộ này đến và kéo mình ra khỏi vòng xoáy bài tập mệt mỏi bất tận ấy. Có lẽ vì thế nên mình chẳng cảm nhận được gì nhiều, chỉ thấy Murakami dù không viết tiểu thuyết nhưng vẫn thật là hay, và vẫn thật là khó hiểu. Và cuốn sách cũng kịp gieo vào đầu mình cái ý niệm về chạy bộ, rằng chạy bộ là một môn thể thao tuyệt vời, hợp với những người như sensei và chắc cũng hợp với những người như mình, và rằng nhất định mình sẽ chạy bộ có ngày.Lần đ��c này là giữa những chiều hè ngồi trước cửa phòng hóng gió ban công tầng 6, may mà chưa hè hẳn nên gió vẫn còn mát.

Cái ý định chạy bộ được khơi lên từ 3 năm trước, đã được hiện thực hoá trong vòng 2 tháng nhờ vào môn chạy bền ở trường đại học, nhưng hết môn cũng là hết chạy. Cứ đà này, chắc là mình chỉ chạy được trong đầu, trong hình dung tưởng tượng của mình. Thế nên lần đọc sách này mình thấy thất bại vô cùng, tự thấy ghét mình vô cùng nhưng mà không thể ghét cuốn sách này được. Mình vẫn sẽ đọc cho đến khi cái sự khó hiểu trở nên dễ hiểu, và cái ý niệm chạy bộ trở thành sự thực.

Es decir, hay cosas que hago habitualmente al correr y situaciones donde me siento muy identificada con él. ¿Voy pensando cuando corro? Sí. ¿Me arrepiento a la mitad -o antes- de haberme inscripto a una carrera? Obvio. ¿Me siento capaz de terminar el recorrido? Nunca. Pero lo hago y Murakami me ayudó a esquematizar todos esos asuntos en mis carreras diarias. Con él disiento en muchas cosas, por supuesto. Cada uno corre por motivos personales y con metas, pero ninguna de las de él me parecen acordes a las mías. Supongo que es su espíritu japonés que lo impera a hacer todo perfecto y querer ganar y todas esas cosas que para mí no tienen sentido. En el medio del libro sentí que perdió la dirección y no la retomó de nuevo, porque correr es hermoso y no un sufrimiento constante ni una manera de ser superior al resto. Correr es ese corredor desconocido que corre a la par tuya, te pasa y vuelve sobre sus pasos a buscarte, o aquel que te da un sorbo de agua mientras te mor��s por llegar al puesto de hidratación, acá no dice nada del que te grita ""¡Dale, vamos, que faltan tres cuadras, que no te queda nada!"" cuando en realidad todavía quedan ocho kilómetros. No sólo no sufrir lesiones y entrenar como loco para decir que corre una maratón por año. O quizá yo sólo esté equivocada y correr sea lo que propone Murakami en este libro."
308,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8813018-robbie-claravall,Rating 5 out of 5,"read this in a single sitting. i couldn’t put it down.pain is inevitable. suffering is optional. it was such a joy to read murakami talk about one of his greatest passions in life—running. every word in this is injected with such vibrant fervour, such cogent tenacity that if you remove one word out from a paragraph, the narrative would tumble and feel anachronistic, like a jenga board crumbling down. you can feel the love in his very veins, that immutable and perpetual longing for the activity, something that, every time he wakes up, would get him out of bed. it is clockwork for him, and his desire to share this passion through writing was absolutely inspiring. it is concise, but he is austere and his ability to communicate what he feels while running was extraordinary. as a pianist (which can be synonymous to murakami as a runner), i felt a part of my soul exposed and written down on the very page—the lofty goals we set for ourselves, the inauspiciousness of competitions, and most of all: our potent, hyperbolic, and superlative love for the activity. it is in the very air we breathe. as we grow older, as we explore terra incognita, we may diminish or weaken in ability in the activities that we love doing (as a result of physical growth and hence deterioration), but that’s not the point. it’s in the passion, the experience, it’s in our brazen and emboldened heart that we keep on doing what we have been doing throughout our entire lives. i may not play all of beethoven’s sonatas perfectly when i am 80, but who cares? at least i never gave up my passion. :)"
309,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"Loved the tome. Murakami puts into words pieces of running insight so eloquently that the moment i finished the book, i grabbed my shoes and hit the asphalt. I stopped for a bit cause my shoes were giving me trouble, and i need to make some huaraches (or barefoot runners) probably but that is unimportant.I used to run in the beach at my old home before, and loved it. There is something glorious about simply moving your feet one after the other, propelling yourself through the air, pretty soon you barely feel in contact with the ground. When you're in form it feels like floating. Your mind is blank and yet it feels like a master computer, completely aware of your body and its immediate surroundings. You are self consumed, and the feeling is the closest I've come to actual meditation.Murakami has been running for decades. And is a much more seasoned runner than little old me. His language is so simple and insights so deep and sudden that they have the effect of a punch in the stomach. Murakami runs a marathon every year, and has inspired me to run one at least once insha Allah. There is such a thing called the Colombo Marathon for those interested in Sri Lanka, google it up.I don't know if non-runners will find this interesting. and i don't know how this compares to Murakami's other work, since i've never read any, but i can vouchsafe to this book being absolutely spiffing, old boy. Give it a go, and hit the beach."

This is a part of my day I can't do without.” Reading this book a second time really gave me a greater appreciation for what Murakami says about running. Since the last time I've read this book I have taken part in at least 4 Half Marathons, I run almost every day and I sorta consider myself a runner. It is no wonder, picking up this book and reading about Murakami's love for running made me so happy. In this book, Writer Haruki Murakami tells us about his love for running, how he goes about training for a marathon and how being a runner changed him. While some of the book can be a bit repetitive, I did enjoy getting a look into what it takes to prepare for a marathon. If you are runner, I think you would definitely appreciate this book.   April 2014 I found this book was really the author's meandering thoughts about his running experience. It offered look into how he prepares for a marathon/triathlon but there wasn't anything major to write home about."

Volim tebe kao obično-neobičnu osobu koja postoji da bi pisala i trčala ili trčala pa pisala i tako pronašla način da razume život svoj i ljudski; kao čoveka koji živi sve teške, samonametnute sate u patikama do pomalo čak i suludih granica izdržljivosti i nema nameru da stane jer bi onda sve bilo besmisleno i, sasvim izvesno, ne bi dalo svetu sve te stranice romana. Divim se tebi kao trkačopiscu ili piscotrkaču koji odbija da, i u situacijama krajnje opasnim po život, hoda ono što je namerio da pretrči ne zato što bi drugi mogli to da vide, jer često i nema nikog da te vidi kako prelaziš te daljine, već zato što ti znaš da nisi hodao već si istrčao, jer tvoja savest sve vidi i prema njoj si iskren i pošten, a to je karakter i poimanje života kakvo se danas retko sreće.“ Ceo tekst na blogu:http://www.englishdiary.rs/o-cemu-gov..."
313,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2876105-marc,Rating 2 out of 5,"Light, very introspective booklet. Murakami talks about his passion for running, and how that is consistent with his writing. For him that amounts to a little talent and a lot of perseverance. To me, as (former) running-addict much was recognizable, but sometimes I frowned my eyebrows, for instance as he talks about breaking the own will of his muscles. In general, I think Murakami is rather harsh on himself, almost denigrating about his many deficiencies; and at times the accounts of his preparations for running competitions were rather dull. If you're interested in Murakami-the writer, if you want to know where he gets the inspiration for his wonderful stories and how exactly he has developed his own writing style, then this book will be a disappointment."
314,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45502331-ashleigh,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.75/5This is the first book of Haruki Murakami's that I have read. I have heard of his others though. I saw this in Ariel Bissett's end of year video where she talks about her favorite books, and this one made the list. She talked so passionately about it that I literally bought it the second after that video ended. I don't run...or write, but I still found myself able to get something out of this book. Haruki Murakami's writing style flows so nicely, and reading this felt like a cool breeze on a hot day (kind of weird comparison but that's what I felt haha). However, I don't know why it is, but nonfiction just doesn't click with me as much. It takes a lot for me to really love a nonfiction book. I took some things away from this but I didn't quite love it. "

І це неможливо не зрозуміти, коли одне перетікає в інше і утворюється коло, кінцевий оберт якого не стане самоціллю, а скоріше логічним завершенням колись давно початої справи. Можна полюбити за: - стоїцизм письма, думок і їх оформлення у відповідні с��ова;- різноманітні образи бігу (умовні і безумовні);- за смак (від музичних платівок через весну-літо-осінь-зиму-і знову весну до філософії забігів на довгі дистанції);- те, що навіть, якщо не ставити собі за мету пробігти марафон чи будь-що пов'язане з бігом, можна сміливо примінити головні принципи концентрації і витривалості до найважливішого для кожного з нас."

Aquí podemos conocer la historia de Murakami como corredor mientras también analiza sus inicios cómo novelista. Comparar estos dos artes que personalmente me gustan mucho, me hacen encontrarle un gusto enorme a Murakami. Me inspira a correr a encontrar esa meta en la cuál me sienta satisfecha y orgullosa de mi misma.

I pored toga, pronašla sam delove koji su mi značili i iz kojih sam mogla da izvučem pouku. Murakami trčanje povezuje sa pisanjem i suštinski daje jednu metaforu za sve aktivnosti u koje ulažemo dosta truda i koje nam znače. Fokusiranost na cilj, podsećanje zašto radimo to što radimo... "

Visgi, perskaičius knygą galėčiau kelis pagrindinius aspektus: discipliną, individualių tikslų siekį, sportą, rašymą. Visus juos autorius vaizduoja kaip vienas kitą papildančius elementus, kurie sudaro tikrąjį jo portretą. Ne paslaptis, kad bėgimas – iššūkis reikalaujantis daug psichologinių ir fizinių pastangų. Todėl autorius knygoje labai tiksliai nusako savo pasiruošimą šiai veiklai. Pradėdamas sportiniais bateliais, pereidamas prie bėgimo tvarkaraščio ir baigdamas mintimis bėgimo metu. Skaitant peršasi mintis, kad bėgimas nėra apie tai, jog aplenktum visus kitus ir pasiektum finišą pirmas. Labiau kova su pačiu savimi, kai bandai kiekvieną stotelę įveikti panaudodamas visas turimas jėgas. Tuomet kitam bėgimui išsikeli tikslą pasirodyti dar geriau. Geriau nei paskutinį kartą pasirodei. Tas pačias mintis būtų galima pritaikyti ir rašymui. Kaip pats autorius teigia, kad be bėgimo nebūtų toks geras rašytojas, koks yra dabar. Kūrinyje atsisakoma bohemiško rašytojo įvaizdžio. Kūryba sugretinama su darbu, turinčiu pradžią ir pabaigą. Su procesu, kurį norint tinkamai atlikti reikia būti savo geriausioje formoje. „Aš sportuoju pirmiausia tam, kad galėčiau gerai rašyti, sureguliuoti kūno jėgas ir jas didinti.“Knygą įvertinčiau stipriais 3 balais iš 5. Tai geras ir labai konkretus kūrinys, kuriam suprasti nereikia didelių pastangų ir papildomos analizės. "

Ma cosa ben diversa è ascoltare la persona in carne ed ossa mentre ti parla della sua vita reale.Delle sue stranezze e della sua cura della fisicità, del suo modo di porsi di fronte alla vita. L'impegno maniacale, le sfide solitarie, la propria asocialità e solitudine. E le sue passioni, scrittura e corsa, legate tra loro nella vita e nell'impegno, la vita organizzata, le vittorie e le sconfitte.A volte si resta sorpresi dalla distanza che c'è tra le due figure, quella immaginata quasi bohemien e quella reale, pratica, fatta di lavoro e viaggi, traslochi e sveglie all'alba, segretarie e conferenze. A volte persino delusi, apprezzando però l'onestà nel descriversi con le proprie paure e speranze.E apprezzando la corsa e tutte le metafore sulla vita che ne conseguono. Il coraggio e le scelte, i frutti dell'impegno e della costanza, e anche le delusioni e il dolore, e nonostante tutto di nuovo la scelta di non mollare, pur prendendo atto della realtà, degli anni che avanzano, dei propri limiti.Una bella lettura.""Se mai ci sarà un epitaffio sulla mia tomba, e se posso sceglierlo io, vorrei che venissero scolpite queste parole:'Murakami Haruki, scrittore (e maratoneta), 1949 - 20**Se non altro, fino alla fine non ha camminato.'Al momento è tutto ciò che spero."""

On naozaj vnáša umenie do tých najnevelkolepejšich udalosti. Kniha plynie a vy s ňou. Je dobrá. Vážne, ak je niečo dobré, tak je to táto kniha. Možno je to autorovým citom pre jazyk, alebo tými nenásilnými životnými múdrami spomenutými len tak mimochodom medzi rečou, ako náhodou. Prirovnávajúc príjimanie vlastného výzoru k vareniu zo zvyškov jedla v chladničke, alebo rýchly príchod zimy k šikovnému vyberačovi daní. Ale nejdem ďalej spojlerovať. Proste poznáte tie knihy kde je akoby každé slovo na správnom mieste? Toto je jedna z nich. Ako povedal Murakami aj holenie sa stane časom filozofickou činnosťou a tak nejak sa to stalo Harukimu s behaním. Kniha je dosť pochmúrna, príde mi neustála nasiaknutá melanchóliou a akýmsi sladkotrpkým akceptovaním života, ale dostať náhľad do Murakamiho mysle bolo pre mňa aj tak potešením. Nápad vyrozprávať svoju autobiografiu v knihe o behu a tak prepojiť väčšinu jeho životných udalostí s behaním na mňa fungoval. Myslím, že už aj ja chápem, že behanie nie je len šport, behanie je aj metafora... vážne, si myslím, že Murakami pre mňa posunul behanie na umenie. A behám už výhradne len na The Lovin' Spoonful. „Tak ako tri jedlá denne - spolu so spánkom, domácimi prácami a písaním - aj behanie som zahrnul do mojej každodennej rutiny. A ako sa z toho stával prirodzený návyk, rozpaky sa vytrácali. Zašiel som do športových potrieb a kúpil si bežeckú výstroj a solídnu obuv, ktoré by vyhovovali môjmu zámeru. Kúpil som si aj stopky, a dokonca som si aj prečítal knihu o behaní pre začiatočníkov. Tak sa z človeka stane bežec.“"
