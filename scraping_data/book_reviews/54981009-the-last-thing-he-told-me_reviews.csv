Nikolaj Coster- Waldau! Another gripping, unputdownable, whirlwind, fast ride you easily attach yourself at the high tension, mysterious story! An interesting fact about this action packed, mind numbing suspense story: is it made me cry so hard when I finished the last page! Because this is also a heart wrenching love story between an introverted, unique , artsy woman who never believed true love till she meets with her husband but later she realizes she does not know anything about his true identity!  Meet Hannah, in her early forties, earning her living by carving woods, a true artist raised by her grandpa, suffering from the absence of her mom in her entire life, finally settles in her suburban life in Sausalito, married with Owen who works in tech company, trying to be a mother to his 16 years old girl Bailey even though she makes everything in her power to make things harder for her!  Her husband teases her to be absentminded. She loses everything like cellphones, sunglasses, baseball hats, socks, lightbulbs, mittens, parking ticket etc. And one day she loses her husband! Wait! She doesn’t lose him! He just sends her a note via 12 years old girl who bumped into his daughter’s school. The note says: “Protect her!” Protect who? From whom? What’s going on? Why the hell her husband doesn’t open his phone? On the news she finds out FBI arrested Owen’s boss because of scandalous tech scheme! Is his husband involved with the scheme? He was stressed because of the work lately.  And why FBI is sniffing around their house and why U. S. Marshall from Texas insists to help her even though this case is out of his jurisdiction! And after calling his ex to defend her as their family lawyer, the investigator her ex hired finds out the ugly truth: her husband’s name is not Owen! He was not graduated from Princeton! He was not from Massachusetts!  Who was her husband? Who was after him? Was it about the company’s fall out or was it something shadier than that which would force them to run away throughout their entire lives? It was fast pacing, engaging reading I devoured in a few hours! The writing style was riveting! Bailey and Hannah is survival quest, chasing the truth, defining their own dysfunctional step mother-daughter relationship were most powerful elements of the book. And thankfully the story wrapped up satisfyingly.  This one is of my best, exciting, intense thriller reads of the year earned my four heart pounding, saddened, doing everything to protect your child stars! I heard so many great things about author’s previous works which I already added a few of them including Eight Hundred Grapes on my chubby tbr.

1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32277569-anna,Rating 1 out of 5,"I honestly thought this was really bad. The writing was poor and inconsistent, there were tons of grammatical errors, and the story demanded a huge suspension of disbelief. Hannah’s husband Owen disappears amidst a scandal at his job, and he leaves behind a note that simply says “Protect her.” This note refers to his 16 year old daughter, Bailey. Hannah then spends the entire book on a fact finding mission to determine what happened, and uncovers secrets about his past. Secrets that, in my opinion, weren’t all that interesting. Along the way, she is rude and dismissive to multiple people that have the nerve to try and help her.I felt that Hannah shouldn’t have been the main character of the story. Nothing really happens TO her - actually, nothing much happens in the present day at all. The majority of the “action” is Hannah finding out about the past. It may have been more interesting to have some chapters from Owen’s perspective, or even to read the entire story from Bailey’s perspective, as she is more closely tied to the main events.Hannah as the narrator also tended to over explain everything that was going on. It was a lot of “tell, don’t show.” One random example: “His face softens. “No, it’s fine,” he says. “She’s my sister. And it’s just a little sensitive ’cause she’s not with us anymore…”His sister. He said she was his sister. And he said she isn’t with them anymore.” Umm yea... we know he said that, Hannah! We were all there. Hannah also had a tendency to say (as the narrator) “that stops me” after people say something important to her. That stops you from what? She is never actively doing anything when the phrase is used, other than listening to someone else talk. I could go on, but all in all, don’t understand the overwhelmingly positive reviews for this book. It was not for me at all."
2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/104207288-jena-roach,Rating 1 out of 5,"1.5 starsOof. I haven't read one this bad in a while. Reese Witherspoon lost my trust a long time ago, but wowza she needs to fire whoever is on her pickin' committee. I'm truly baffled by the hype for this book. Hannah, a character with about as much zip as a saltine cracker, finds a note from her husband Owen that simply says, ""Protect her."" (Don't worry you don't have to remember that line because the author repeats it 304930 times.) Puzzled, our vanilla bean protagonist does not understand why her husband no longer answers her calls and seems to have abandoned her and his 16-year-old daughter Bailey (Hannah's stepdaughter). Soon, Bailey finds an obscene amount of money stuffed into her locker at school and the company Owen worked for is under FBI investigation. Hannah has no clue what's happening but decides to gallivant off to Austin (off a random hunch) with Bailey in search of clues. From there, the pair stumble along into who Owen used to be and why he chose to jump ship. The pacing of this story was bad enough--slower than a man taking a dump. But there was absolutely zero pizazz, no mystery, no intrigue. We're told Hannah and Bailey--the dullest duo in fiction--are in a lot of danger, but we never are truly shown. And after all the traipsing around Austin to get to know the ""real"" Owen... it still doesn't make sense to me why Owen he had to leave. Essentially, this could have been communicated with an email, and I don't see how Hannah handled this all so well... but again, no personality so how could she?Also, can we all agree that titled chapters (with the exception of dates/character names) are extremely juvenile? The Last Thing I'll Tell You, skip this one."
3,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39749481-holly-b-short-break,Rating 3 out of 5,"I would call this one more of a domestic drama with just a bit of suspense.It was slightly addictive in the beginning, but became pretty far-fetched pretty quickly and I wasn't buying into the ""predicament"" this family got wrapped up in. Their actions didn't seem reasonable or realistic. There was some good character development, but the further I got, the more outlandish it became and not in a good, fun way. I don't mind suspending belief most of the time, I was just expecting a realistic type of suspense story.Lot's of GR friends loved this one, so perhaps I was expecting something a little more fast paced/captivating with a better pay off.  Just an okay read for me!Library loan 5/23/2021"
4,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26560207-gabby,Rating 2 out of 5,"Less of a thriller and more of a mystery in my opinion. I thought this story started off pretty strong and interesting but I quickly lost interest and became bored with the story and didn't really care what happened to this man. It was quick enough read, but totally forgettable. I finished it a few days ago and I'm already starting to forget the details."

6,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30181442-yun,Rating 2 out of 5,"Let me ask you a hypothetical question. Say your husband is missing and you're trying to find him. You reach out to someone you think has a connection to your husband. When they say, ""I can explain,"" do you:1. Calmly engage this person in conversation so you can learn what you need to know.Or2. Run out of there screaming like a lunatic.If you picked 2, then congratulations. You are a shoo-in for a character in a domestic thriller, where everyone acts as crazy as possible, especially when the answer is right there.Why do I let the hype get to me, especially when it comes to thrillers? They hardly ever live up to expectations, and most of them are so silly as to be ridiculous. In fact, if I had a dollar for every time I rolled my eyes while reading a thriller, I'd be a millionaire right now. But alas, all I have to show are bruised eyeballs.What is there to say about this book that I haven't said a thousand times already? The premise is certainly captivating, and the start is strong. Then, slowly but surely, it devolves into nonsensical silliness, along with a heaping serving of the main female character acting ever more paranoid. And on top of that, there aren't even any good twists or surprises in here. The story unfolded pretty much as expected, which is the complete opposite of what a thriller should be.Sorry if I sound bitter. I really had high hopes for this one, but obviously it didn't work out. On the plus side, I can safely put my copy in the donation pile and free up one precious spot on my bookshelf.~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧"

First of all, I'm really happy for all my GR friends who loved this book. I'm glad I gave it a try after reading your wonderful reviews. I liked the premise, but I thought the execution was a bit simplistic and the main character was bland.On the other hand, I had no problem with the writing and it was a fast read. I wasn't bored, but I wasn't enthralled nor touched either. I definitely felt there was something missing. 2.5 starsMany thanks to Netgalley and Simon & Schuster Canada for the ARC!"

He leaves her a note, “Protect her.” What could it mean? One thing. His daughter, Bailey. Bailey, the 16 year old, who is high on attitude and likes her stepmother as much as the typical 16 year old. What happened to Owen? How will things turn out for Bailey and Hannah? Clear your schedule because you will need to read this book non-stop! It wasn’t boring at all – this book was definitely thrilling! The book would focus on the present and then would cut to a flashback where Hannah is trying to comb through her memories looking for clues. This give the book such a realistic feel as when something goes wrong you try to think back on could you see this coming, what did you miss? The particular manner in which this book was written, it always felt as if you were going to make a big discovery eminently and would learn a little more, a little more along the way.

“Don’t Ask a Question You Don’t Want the Answer To.”The Last Thing He Told Me 
 is a mystery/domestic suspense about a man living a lie and his wife and daughter who struggle to discover who he really is When Hannah Hall receives a note from her husband stating nothing more than “Protect her,” one random afternoon, her whole world shatters. Her husband Owen has disappeared without a trace, and she soon learns that he was not the man she thought he was. Charged with taking care of her contentious stepdaughter, Bailey, she and Bailey slowly begin to investigate Owen leading them to danger and a startling revelation.This was my first Laura Dave book, and she hooked me right from the start. Her writing style, the characters, the plot, and the pacing felt authentic.  Hannah narrates events in the present moment, but we also get flashbacks to her marriage to Owen. It helped that Hannah doesn’t feel sorry for herself. Her emotions are subtle, real, and honest. While the mystery of Owen’s past is intriguing, the strength of this book lies in the characters. This is not as much about Hannah's relationship with Owen, but more about her relationship with Bailey.  I didn’t love the epilogue, but it does offer some closure. Overall, I absolutely loved this book and can't wait to read more by Laura Dave!I received an ARC of this book from NetGalley and Simon & Schuster in exchange for an honest review."
11,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/91434473-daph-pink,Rating 2 out of 5,"2*whatever* stars! This is going to be one of those hyped books I found pretty average.It started off really well with a good enough mystery to keep my mind around, but then it slowly started getting downhill with its boring narrative and pretty average plotline and twists. The writing was pretty easy to read which I am most thankful about, otherwise I don't know how the hell I would have completed this in two sitting. And don't even get me started on that ridiculously filmy and cheesy ending. Hannah *my middle name is drama* *whatever is my surname* is one of the most bland character I have ever read about and reading the entire book from her POV, please save me.Bailey *I remember details at crucial times from way back when I was four* is the perfect partner for our narrator who is equally boring. Hannah being the main character wasn't that important all all because she actually isn't the part of the whole mystery. She is just here to ""PROTECT HER"".Overall, I just want it to get over and not think about it ever again."
12,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49815208-marilynw,Rating 4 out of 5,"The Last Thing He Told Me by Laura DaveHannah Hall has married Owen, a man that walked into her 'woodturning"" shop and swept her off her feet despite her resistance, due to having just broken up with her fiancée. Owen's sixteen year old daughter, Bailey, despises everything about Hannah but Hannah is determined to win her over someday. Life is good for Hannah, she loves her work, she loves both Owen and Bailey, she finally has a family after suffering for decades over feelings of abandonment because her parents left her when she was young. Then one morning, she kisses Owen as he heads to work and that's the last she sees of him. She gets a note, delivered by a little girl, that says ""protect her"". The FBI arrests his boss and shows up on her doorstep. Bailey's dad has left a HUGE puzzling gift for her in her locker at school. Things are falling apart and what Hannah knows about Owen is no longer adding up. Rather than waiting to see how things unfold, Hannah takes action. Based on a picture and very unreliable memories from when Bailey was less than 4 years old, they are off to a distant city to try to find out Owen's true identity. Is Owen who he says he is and if he's not, what does that mean for Hannah and even more so, for Bailey, his daughter? It's hard to imagine that I would make the choices that Hannah and Bailey make throughout the book but the good thing that comes out of all of this is that they both realize that they have each other through whatever is going on in their lives. What I was drawn to in this story is less the mystery and more the growing relationship between Hannah and Bailey. I think their reliance on each other and Bailey's change as she opens up to Hannah, while she convinces Hannah to be open with her, too, is what makes the story work for me. Their world has become a different, scary place and I enjoyed watching them work through the realization that their lives would never be the same again. Publication: May 4th 2021Thank you to Simon & Schuster and NetGalley for this ARC."

14,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22523936-katie-akins,Rating 1 out of 5,"I received this book through Book of the Month. I poured myself a glass of wine, settled into my hammock chair on the back patio and relished the idea of a good read.As soon as I cracked open The Last Thing He Told Me, a bird pooped in it.Now, as far as I know, birds can't read, but I'm not Snow White. And so, rather than heed the obvious warning from my avian brethren, I snapped a picture for social media, wrote a quippy caption, and after making sure the bird didn't poop in my wine, I read it anyway.Turns out birds can read, and never again will I doubt their taste in literature.This book is boring.If I can skip five pages, skim the sixth, and still know what's going on, that's not good. Based on the writing, I am legitimately not certain this author has ever heard anyone have a conversation before. The dialogue is like listening to a drunk uncle tell you about that trip he took to Florida in '85 where nothing happened.The author wastes no time dumping you directly into the problem, and that is exciting for approximately ten pages before it jumps backward like that same drunk uncle going, ""But before I go into that, I should go back, and tell you how she met Owen."" We all just wish you'd started there and hope to God this story has a point.Because the audience is never introduced to Owen and Hannah's relationship through anything but tiny flashbacks, I had no skin in the game, and therefore, did not care at all about what happened to these characters. Yes, it would be jarring to have your husband disappear one day, but since I've never met your husband, I literally could not care less about his fate. I actually cared more about her ex-fiance than her current husband. He seemed nice, and I'm not sure why she hated him so much.That is Problem One.Problem Two is that the author goes to great pains to create a conflict out of a situation with a relatively simple solution. The real problem is that the main character refuses to accept this relatively simple solution through the whole book for no reason other than burning curiosity and idiocy, which makes it increasingly frustrating to follow her around.And that leads me to Problem Three.The entire relationship in this book leans on the tired trope of evil stepmother and bratty, entitled stepdaughter and their journey to closeness. I am so very tired of every step-relationship being built on this trope. I had to endure the attitude of a thoroughly unlikeable teen while she berates, ignores, and insults her eager to please stepmother who keeps her pain inside like a true winner. The problem is that we, the audience, are inside for every agonizing moment of Hannah's self doubt. The result is that I disliked both of them very much by the end.In closing, if a bird poops in a book you are about to read, take the warning."
15,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/106411707-erica-lieb,Rating 1 out of 5,"I enjoyed reading the 2 star and below reviews more than I enjoyed the actual book. At least I’m not alone in my reaction to this faulty plot. Hannah’s characterization made NO sense. She starts off as this flighty, artsy, successful wood maker who daintily loses her parking ticket on her first date with Owen. Then she (mind you with no progression), grows into super mom and detective of the year. She also seemed to drop her career along the way. Lots of random side plots and characters with unanswered questions. Don’t care to know the answers. Just a really bad read. "

17,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10171516-jessica,Rating 4 out of 5,"ive seen mixed reviews for this one, so i was a little nervous going into it. but i had literally zero expectations, which is probably why i enjoyed it so much.i was immediately hooked from the beginning. i think the pacing is spot on, the flashbacks are effective, the characters are relatable, and the plot is very straightforward. i really, really enjoyed how even though the mystery of the missing husband is at the forefront of the story, the growing bond between hannah and bailey is really worth reading. the only blip would be the general ending - i dont think its very strong and i can understand why many readers are let down by it. its not really a thrilling ending, but suitable, if that makes sense. it fits the overall vibe of the story, so i personally dont mind it. i also loved the epilogue, so that helped me overlook it, as well.overall, i enjoyed this much more than i thought i would and it definitely has me interested in picking up the authors other books!↠ 4 stars"
18,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19736308-susan-s-reviews,Rating 3 out of 5,"Such decent writing. Such a dull, long winded plot.Such an unsatisfying ending for me. This one got me down.I'm rating it a 3.5 out of 5 and reducing it to a 3 because I had just read a hilarious comedy (The Car Share), and was feeling no pain, only to be brought down by this one.Emotional manipulation, a term I'm borrowing from another Goodreads' friend, is not my thing: people will flock to books that make you cry: I'll only read those if there is redemption and a hint of hope to be found. This one just put a big frown on my face, despite the often decent writing style, although the dialogue was sometimes off or just seemed like a time waster/filler.This was not my cup of tea and is the second book by this author that left me feeling emotionally unsatisfied. (A little more effort and a solution could have been found. I thought of a few myself: like cosmetic surgery, for one. You can even alter finger prints these days. Why not be inventive? These saviour complex heroines exhaust me sometimes. Halos are a dime a dozen.)Such a disappointing soap opera!"
19,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34183387-regina,Rating 4 out of 5,"The thing is, I like mysteries that aren’t about someone being murdered or sexually assaulted once in awhile. Unraveling the “what happened” thread in a novel doesn’t always have to be tied to figuring out who did the stabbing or the grabbing. In The Last Thing He Told Me, Hannah’s new husband vanishes right after he has a note delivered to her asking that she protect his teenage daughter, Bailey. Here the “what happened” questions are: Where did he go? Protect her from what? Will he come back? Why has a US Marshal shown up on her doorstep if the FBI says that agency isn’t involved? Over the course of the next 300 pages, we follow Hanna as she and her semi-hostile stepdaughter band together to find the answers. I liked their relationship and thought it felt very authentic. I found Hannah’s choices to be fairly reasonable under the extreme circumstances she was facing. I enjoyed the Sausalito, CA and Austin, TX settings. I found the ending to be plausible if not 100% satisfying. Reese Witherspoon picked this as the May 2021 selection for her book club. You should pick it for yours. Ms. Witherspoon is already working on an limited series adaptation for Apple TV that will star Julia Roberts, and you know you want to read the book beforehand.

I still think about it months and months later. So five big ones. Original ReviewI haven't been in a reviewing mood lately at ALL, but I wanted to get something down here before I completely forgot...I really enjoyed this one. I enjoyed Dave's writing and I liked how things were slowly revealed to us. I don't want to say too much as I obviously don't want to include spoilers, but I did enjoy how the relationship between Bailey and Hannah transformed over time, especially as revealed at the ending. Which brings me to just that: the ending...I didn't love it. At ALL. But I also wonder if I would have enjoyed the book as much without it. In fact, much of the book's power for me resided in the final ""epilogue"" scene, which wouldn't have been possible without the ending it had. So...definitely a conundrum. Very bittersweet, I guess. Anyway, I'll read more from this author."
22,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36310974-preoccupiedbybooks,Rating 5 out of 5,"Published Today! (4th May 2021) A suspenseful, addictive and surprisingly emotional mystery about family and loveHannah Hall receives a note from her husband Owen, saying only 'protect her' before he disappears, leaving Hannah to take care of his 16 year old daughter Bailey. What is going on? Where is Owen? Who can Hannah trust? And does she really know her husband?I really enjoyed The Last Thing He Told Me, and flew through the pages, needing to know what would happen to Hannah, Bailey and Owen! I always know I'm enjoying a book when I tell my husband about it, and when I think about it when I'm not reading, which was definitely the case here!I hadn't heard of Laura Dave before I saw a glowing review by my friend Ceecee, but decided to request it, and now I want to read more of this author's work because this hooked me in from the start, and kept me entertained until the end! I loved the writing style, it was really engaging, pulling me in fast, and keeping me on my toes, as I discovered all was not what it seemed.The story was told from Hannah's first person POV in the present tense. Present tense doesn't always work for me, but this one did, perhaps because it also had flashbacks into Hannah's past. It was a character driven story, and really focussed on their relationships. I loved Hannah, she was strong, independent, resourceful and real. I felt for her as she tried to muddle through such a stressful and worrying time, whilst still trying to win over her stepdaughter. Bailey was very well written as a teenager! Their relationship was so well written, and I enjoyed seeing the bond between them blossom. Motherhood comes in many forms, and you could feel Hannah's love for Bailey throughout the story. Owen had disappeared right from the start of the book, but I still felt like I knew him, due to the flashbacks, and from Hannah and Bailey's love for him. I also liked hearing about Hannah's grandfather, and his effect on her life.I've seen that some reviewers didn't like the bittersweet ending, but I cannot see how it could've ended any other way. I was satisfied with it, even though I couldn't see the writing at points because my tears blurred the words! I saw earlier that this is being adapted, which I am pleased about because this would transfer so well to the screen I think!This would be a great book to read to get you out of a slump, or if you want a quick, gripping, character driven story!Many thanks to NetGalley and Serpent's tail/Viper/Profile Books for my ARC, in exchange for an honest review!"
23,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16912659-dorie---cats-books,Rating 3 out of 5," ***NOW AVAILABLE***My first thoughts on this book as I was finishing it were that this was a very slowly paced novel. This is definitely not a thriller as I would define it. I never had that taut, scary feeling that something was going to happen that was terrible, horrible, world changing. There was suspense but it was not that chilling feeling I was expecting. The author definitely has a knack for creating and filling out her characters. Hannah is a woman who loves her husband and can’t believe that he has left them. Bailey is at an age, 16, where she questions everything, except for one thing, HER FATHER LOVES HER!!Hannah is married to Owen, has been for a little over a year. Hannah is a skilled artisan, working with wood to turn out tables, etc. Owen, as far as she knew, was working for a software tech company. They live in a houseboat in the fairly quiet seaside town of Sausalito. (I happen to have visited that area and it is a beautiful place to live). Owen and Bailey had been living here for about a decade.One morning Owen disappears and before Hannah even has time to process what is happening, the TV news tells Hannah that “The Shop”, the name of the company Owen works for, is being investigated for fraud, etc. The head of the company, Avett, has already been arrested and is awaiting trial. The company basically has been selling stock in a company producing a software product that isn’t yet functional!!Things are happening so fast that Hannah is having a hard time deciding what to do. Owen’s daughter, Bailey, is just starting to warm up to the idea that Hannah is her step mother. She lost her mother at a very young age and really has no memory of her. Hannah is drawn to her because she also lost her mother and can understand the pain and confusion.Soon a US Marshall from Texas, Grady, appears at her door, offering to find a way to protect Hannah and Bailey, that is to put them in the Witness Protection Program. Hannah doesn’t think this is what she wants for herself or Bailey. They would have to completely change their lives, their interests, the people that they let into their lives. Hannah doesn’t want this for Bailey, she thinks she can find another way for them to live.Hannah is very resourceful and her friend Jules helps her to dive into the mystery that is Owen. They find out his past and what happened after his first wife died. There is a lot that Owen hasn’t told Hannah. He left her only one note that said “Protect Her” and Hanah knows who he means.The majority of the novel is Hannah looking for the truth, finding it, and making a deal that will affect the rest of her life. Grady, the US Marshall is completely against the idea. “You can’t trust him. It’s crazy for you to think you can. You can not make a deal with the devil and expert it to turn out okay.” I turn away from him, look out the window. “Except I just did”.This book is well written and I did think the characters were interesting and well described. The pace is just what put me off, it seemed to take forever to get to the “good part”. There are many 4 and 5 star reviews out there so my recommendation is to go in blind and see how you feel about it!!I received an ARC of this novel from the publisher through Edelweiss.This novel is set to publish on May 4, 2021."
24,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4125660-liz,Rating 5 out of 5,"As a stepmother whose husband had full custody of 4 teenage girls, this book immediately grabbed me. It’s been decades, but I still remember that feeling of walking on eggshells, trying to develop a relationship with each of them. In fact, at one point, Hannah thinks something I always used to tell myself - pick your battles. So, when her husband Owen goes missing, leaving her a note instructing her to protect her step daughter Bailey, I could totally picture myself in her shoes. I love how these two set out trying to discover exactly what Owen was trying to hide and realizing it goes beyond the financial fraud his company is accused of. It’s a fabulous story - taut, suspenseful. One of the few mysteries that combines in depth character development and a believable plot. (Well, except for one scene when Labrador retrievers are supposed to be guard dogs!). There is a great sense of tension throughout this book. They don’t know who to believe or who to trust. They’re forced to depend more and more on each other. And in the end, the story deals with what it means to be a mother. That it’s not just about blood. To make decisions for a child, not for yourself. This made a great audiobook. Rebecca Lowman did a wonderful job as a narrator."
25,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38610813-paromjit,Rating 4 out of 5,"Laura Dave writes a terrifically impressive and moreish suspense novel that shines in its depiction of a moving and growing relationship between Hannah and her 16 year old stepdaughter, Bailey, that develops from a problematic one to a more profound and trusting one. Its evolution begins with the disappearance of Owen Michaels, a man Hannah had been married to for just longer than a year, only for him to suddenly disappear, leaving behind a strange note saying 'protect her' with reference to Bailey. What could have happened to make Owen leave behind his daughter? Bailey, who had lost her mother in an accident when she was a young child, is left a mass of confusion and pain, feelings Hannah can understand and relate to. Matters become darker when the boss of the tech software company Owen worked for is arrested by the FBI for fraud, with the FBI and a US Air Marshall wanting to know more about Owen.Hannah, a skilled craftswoman working in wood, proves to be a resilient, compassionate, courageous, smart, and ferociously determined mother who makes the decision to look into the man she had married as she joins forces with a Bailey that comes to rely on her and begins to trust her. It does not take long before it starts to become apparent that Owen is far from what he appeared to be in this tense narrative that goes back and forth in time, with a focus on Hannah's marriage. There are numerous twists and turns, that involve going from Sausalito, their Californian home, to Austin, Texas, with the truth coming as a shockingly unexpected surprise. This is a riveting, thoughtful, engaging and entertaining read, succinct with short chapters, well plotted and with complex and realistic characters that feel all too authentic. It touches on the nature of family, secrets, deception, danger, and the ties that bind. I understand this is going to be turned into a TV series featuring Julia Roberts! Highly recommended. Many thanks to Serpent's Tail/Profile Books for an ARC."
26,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/260116-janb,Rating 5 out of 5,"Hannah is happily married to Owen, and struggling with her relationship with his daughter, Bailey, who is barely civil to her. Hannah’s husband disappears and she finds only a note with two words: “Protect her”. She knows the note refers to her stepdaughter Bailey. But why? And protect her from what? When Hannah receives visits from the FBI and a U.S Marshal, and does some digging herself, she begins to understand that her husband Owen was not who she thought he was. Told in two timelines – one with brief flashbacks to the past, which gives us context and a fuller picture of Hannah and Owen’s life together, and the second is in the present when Hannah and Bailey are forced to work together to find out the truth about Owen. Hannah is smart and intuitive in how she deals with Bailey and their relationship was one of my favorite things about the story. Set in Sausalito and Austin, Texas, Hannah navigates the twists and turns using her intelligence combined with good instincts. She has to reconcile the husband she knows and loves with the new information she receives about him. As the novel progresses, Hannah must figure out what she needs to do to protect Bailey, and make a difficult choice on how to move forward. How she does so was completely unpredictable, yet perfect, which elevated this from a typical mystery/thriller. Many books in this genre disappoint me with the ending, but in this case, I loved it.  So much to love about this one. I loved the relationship between Hannah and Bailey. I loved that the author didn't make Bailey precocious or annoying (as so many teens in fiction). I loved that the ending, the choice she made was completely unpredictable. I loved the epilogue, and I usually hate them. I loved that Hannah was smart and intelligent with good instincts not only in her search for Owen, and making her final decision, but in dealing with a difficult teenager and navigating the stepmother/stepdaughter relationship. My reading buddy, Marialyce, and I both chose this for our BOTM selection last month and we were not disappointed! I read and enjoyed a previous contemporary novel of the author’s but this is a new genre for the author. I hope there are more to come! Recommended for those who love character-driven domestic mysteries that are still strong on plot. If you enjoy smartly written, strong, intelligent women protagonists, you will love Hannah."

Overall, this is a simple tale, but full of meaning and nuance. The basic premise is that Hannah has been married to Owen for just under two years. He has a sixteen-year-old daughter Bailey, and she and Hannah don't really connect. One day out of the blue, a girl comes to the door with a note for Hannah from Owen that says ""protect her"" and Bailey finds a duffel bag filled with money in her locker with a note saying that he has to disappear. The company Owen works for has been raided, people arrested. It appears that Owen has fled to avoid prosecution, but the more Hannah discovers, the more she feels that there is more to the story. Owen has been hiding a great deal from everyone.I liked the way this book told the story, both in the present day and giving glimpses into the past. Although Hannah and Bailey venture into armchair detective status, it never gets unrealistic or unbelievable, the things they do are straightforward and probably things that anyone would do in their situation, not knowing who they can trust. I liked the development of Hannah and Bailey's relationship, that too felt incredibly realistic. The ending put the perfect cap onto the story, this isn't a predictable tale, the conclusion is surprising and yet believable. Overall this is a wonderfully told story with just enough mystery to keep the reader invested, and also enough character and relationship development to provide drama and emotion. Highly recommended.I voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book, all opinions are my own."
28,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5210022-julie,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Last Thing He Told Me by Laura Dave is a 2021 Simon & Schuster publication. This book got lots of ‘buzz’ last year, was a Reese Witherspoon book club pick, and an instant NYT bestseller. Naturally, I added it to my TBR list… but it took me over a year to finally get around to reading it, but boy was it worth the wait!! The story grabbed my attention immediately, but I couldn’t have guessed how engrossing, smart and well-plotted the book would be, or how emotional it would become… Hannah and her teenage stepdaughter, Bailey, are having trouble adjusting to one another, though Bailey’s father, Owen, insists his daughter will eventually come around. So far, though, Hannah's hasn't been able to win her over... But then, Owen, only barely manages to get a brief, simple message to Hannah, sending her a note which read ‘protect her’- obviously referring to Bailey. With that, he proceeds to vanish- seemingly because his employer runs afoul of the law.  But his possible culpability is the least of their worries, and suddenly Hannah and Bailey must work together, whether Bailey likes it or not, if they hope to find Owen, battling unknown forces in their quest to uncover the truth… The suspense is palpable, the mystery deep and compelling. The plotting is tight, the pacing so pitch perfect it was impossible to put this book down.  But the story reaches out further than the mystery/thriller elements to create a mother/daughter bond that beyond all else is the cornerstone of the story-And is ultimately the most rewarding pay- off. Overall, this book did indeed live up to the hype. As 2022, with one or two notable exceptions, has mainly served up stale, lukewarm offerings in the thriller category, thus far, I was relieved to discover I had an ace in the hole with this one. Highly recommend!! 5 stars"

Hannah knows that he is referring to his 16 year old daughter, Bailey, from a previous marriage,but from WHO or WHAT must she protect her from?She thought she knew her husband pretty well, but he was hiding more than a few secrets, and she will need her uncooperative step daughter to help her unravel the clues if she is going to figure out exactly what Owen would want her to do.Laura Dave writes well developed characters and she does real life, messy relationships well! I adored her 2015 novel “Eight Hundred Grapes” 🍇 🍷, which was a 5 ⭐️ love story based in California wine country, so I was eager to read this one, since it involved some suspense!But, this is definitely DOMESTIC SUSPENSE, not a thriller, so expect this to focus on the relationships between the characters as they reveal their true selves, as much as it does the mystery. Hannah is likable, Bailey is 16 through and through, and Owen? How can he leave his daughter when she already lost her mother when she was just a baby? I was fully engaged and interested in finding out, but wanted to feel more angst from Hannah and Bailey as they contemplated their possible future without Owen. Especially toward the end. An epilogue fills you in on what transpires, necessary or it would end without any resolution, and it was touching, but maybe just a little TOO easy? 🎁I would like to thank the Publisher for my gifted copy!

Hannah tells us what she knows about Owen:...Twenty-eight years ago, a man walked into her woodturner studio wearing a sports jacket and sneakers. He took her to dinner and the theater.

The best part about this one is the authors great skill level, the voice, the characters.This is a Reese Whitherspoon book club choice. I have yet to have a bad read with her books. She always makes excellent choices. Some, of course are better than others. This one is a short read. The way the book is constructed with the extra pages at chapter breaks, the font, spacing, it makes it seem longer. This one is 3.5 stars, rounding up to 4. The story didn’t have enough depth of story and the meager info was meted out a little too slowly. When a well-used premise is utilized I prefer to have a lot more depth in the story design, details and twists coming fast and furious, but that’s just me. This is a great beach read, or an afternoon with a hot cup of tea sitting by the sliding glass door with a view of the world. I do recommend this book."
33,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25532045-kat-books-are-comfort-food,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is a low-key (versus frantic) suspenseful story that kept me turning page after page. I enjoyed the characters and especially the relationship between Hannah and Bailey. Owen and Hannah were married only but a year when he doesn’t return home from work, instead she’s handed a note that says, “Protect her.”This kicks off the mystery about where Owen is, what he’s done and where that leaves Hannah and Bailey, who don’t get along, because Bailey hasn’t taken well to Hannah as a step-mom. Hannah takes us on an adventure, as she determined to find the truth about how both she and Hannah were dumped into this horrible mess. Who really is Owen? Did she really know him at all? Has their marriage been a sham from the beginning? I think you will enjoy finding answers to these questions just as Hannah and Bailey. I enjoyed the ride we get by Hanna’s detective skills, ferreting truth from fiction and how one innocent comment led to a clue and on to the next.I thoroughly enjoyed this read, it’s ups and downs and an ending in which the author didn’t rush or get sloppy with. I’ll definitely be looking at Laura Dave’s other books."

He must be referring to his sixteen year old daughter Bailey with whom step-mum Hannah has a tricky relationship. After receiving the note Hannah and Bailey’s lives change in ways they could never have foreseen. The story is told by Hannah in the present and with flashbacks from her first meeting Owen which works really well. I couldn’t put this down!! This is how you write a domestic thriller novel! There’s nothing unnecessary, it’s not overlong, the chapters are short, crisp and to the point but the author skilfully creates a real feeling of authenticity. The writing isn’t flashy or over the top, it’s just darned good storytelling I engage with immediately. I love the chapter headings which have a good dose of wit about them. The settings are really good as is the characterisation. Hannah is clever, resourceful, an independent thinker and brave as she’s prepared to do whatever it takes. The portrait of teenager Bailey is very strong, you feel her confused and torn emotions. I like how their relationship changes, develops and morphs as they unite in their attempts to seek out the truth. There are some really good twists and turns in the well paced plot as Hannah pieces together what small snippets of information she has and maximises them. Their anger, confusion and uncertainty of what to believe about Owen comes across well and you admire Hannah’s ingenuity in piecing it together. There’s nail biting suspense as the very unpretty tale emerges which keeps me gripped throughout. The ending is maybe a bit too neatly tied in a bow but that’s not to say I don’t like it - I do!! Overall, I love this book, finding it a well written and very entertaining, enjoyable thriller demonstrating just how far people will go for love.

But the more she searches, the more she uncovers and Hannah may have just put her and her stepdaughter right in the path of danger.I did not expect to love this book so much when I picked it up. It’s been very popular at the library where I work and I had heard lots of buzz about it. Imagine my surprise when my audiobook hold came in and I just couldn’t stop listening. This book was so compelling!! First with where the husband went, then the whys, and then even more layers added to the situation. The thing that really got me about this book was the relationship between Hannah and Bailey. I don’t think people realize how special a person it takes to love and raise a child that isn’t biologically theirs, do do anything, be everything for that child. There’s lots of stories about evil stepparents, but I have had the privilege of a stepparent that raised me as their own and I know remarkable it is. So I really connected with this book on that particular level because I saw myself and my parents in this story. This book gets five stars because at the end of it I actually was tearing up while listening."

That being said this was still a solid read for me. The main characters were realistic, fleshed out and incredibly likable. This was mostly a story about the relationship between a stepmother and stepdaughter, who at the beginning of this novel have a rocky relationship to say the least. The mystery element unfortunately didn't do a whole lot for me, but it was the exquisite writing that kept me reading. The words just seemed to flow so effortlessly that I soon found myself turning the pages rapidly. This is a sign of great writing to me as I've found that if I'm not completely engaged with the story sometimes it seems like a chore to continue reading, but not the case with this book! I did feel like the climax to the mystery was a tad bit disappointing, but the ending wrapped the characters story lines up nicely, and I appreciated the open-ended part (won't say anymore than that!). I would recommend this, however I would recategorize this as a family drama / mystery more so than a suspense / thriller, as to avoid disappointing some fellow thriller fanatics out there."

It's 100% a spoiler, so don't read further if you don't want the ending spoiled. So Hannah figures out who her husband really is and what he is running away from. She then decides that her stepdaughter would be safest from unknown criminals if they both no longer have any contact with her husband but they do have some kind of relationship with his previous wife's extended family. The other choice was they all go into witness protection where they all have to hide and uproot their lives, but they do get to stay together. She doesn't even consult the 16 year old daughter on which scenario she would prefer. I personally don't think I would have made that same choice. Also, I will say this isn't a thriller by any means, it's more of a domestic drama/mystery."

A stepdaughter that doesn't care for her.Originally when I finished this one it felt right. It was a short 8 hour 50 minute listen with an interesting beginning, a treasure hunt in the middle and a fade-out ending! I thought...In hindsight, and as I write this, it was a fast pace suspense story in the beginning that loses steam in the end. All the pieces come together but they don't add up and the ending wasn't for me. The characters felt one dimensional and I didn't connect with any of them. The audiobook was narrated by Rebecca Lowman whose voicing was a bit muddled and clipped. It was an acceptable experience but I always look for and expect more entertainment value in an audiobook and its narrator than I received from this one. I'm an outlier with this one, so please check out other reviews before you cross this one off your list! 2.5 stars rounded down. "

But is that all there is to the story? No.Obviously not or it wouldn't be worth writing a book about, would it?When a stranger hands Hannah a note from her husband with the words Protect her written on them, her life will never be the same.  Protect who?Her surly 16 year old stepdaughter, Bailey, that's who. Now, Bailey is not at all interested in sharing her father with his new wife, or making room for Hannah in her life, no matter how hard she tries. But Hannah loves her husband and (more importantly) she loves Bailey, and since these were the cards she was dealt, she fully intends to play them. Alright. I knew nothing about this story except the title going into it and I had an enjoyable time. It didn't blow my mind but it was a fun mysteryish sort of tale. The story is told in the present day and in flashbacks, which is always a cool way to go in my opinion.I thought it had kind of a farty little ending, though. I thought her husband had been ridiculous to take his daughter and run off just because his wife's father was a mob lawyer. Just tell your father-in-law that you don't want to be involved with his business stuff anymore and let it go. When Hannah first found out that ""the mob"" had killed Bailey's mom because her grandfather lost a case, I called bullshit. That's just bad business practice and it made no sense. So when Bailey's mob lawyer grandfather said that his daughter was actually killed as a warning to the judge she worked for to back off of some sort of environmental protection act he was looking at, I completely believed him. That? That made sense. So basically Owen was an idiot to turn state's evidence on the mob and (IMHO) he ruined his own life. If you're that stupid, I have zero sympathy for you. Hannah and his daughter will probably be much better off without any dumbass advice from him. But I think a lot of people will love it."

This book has received some mighty high reviews and I honor that. But it didn't ring as many bells for me.The Last Thing He Told Me circles around Hannah Hall whose husband, Owen, is missing. Slam the door and gone. No warnings, no hints, no routine out of the usual. He just doesn't return home one day leaving his sixteen year old daughter, Bailey, in Hannah's care. There is a note later delivered by a young girl with only two words: Protect her. And most definitely Hannah will.I was taken with the beginnings of this book as the voice of Hannah describes her initial relationship with the missing Owen. It had substance and a believability factor going for it in the first half. As the weight of the impact hits Hannah, we feel her frustrations and fear. But what landed with a thud were the outrageous ""clues"" pieced together from nuggets forced out of nowhere and the sudden memories that Bailey had from her toddler years. I most certainly wanted to get onboard. The ""paydirt"" came so late and the unwinding took forever. That's just me. Take it out for a spin and see what you think. It's still an enjoyable read."

I wish the main character, Hannah, had some more personality and characterization to truly have the reader feel her emotions. The teenage girl, Bailey, was an awesome addition and someone I felt was a much stronger character than the MC. Their banter was fun and cute and ultimately had a great message by the end. The best part was the end chapters but the very last chapter I felt was missing something. I think I wanted more depth in that last chapter to find more closure in the book.  I go into Reese’s picks with high hopes but have yet to read a 5 ⭐️ from the ones I have read. This is another example of a thriller that doesn’t need to be a murder mystery to grab anyone’s attention. It is a bit slow in some parts but is a great read for thriller lovers without murder to drive the plot forward. 4⭐️ for being an easy read and being a good thriller without all the murder and gore.

Not that it's mature but that it feels traditional and stuffy in the worst ways. It seems purposefully inaccessible to a younger audience. Or to anyone who doesn't have a 'Bless This Home' sign in their kitchen. The level of sleuthing these two do is insane. They take a whiff of a clue and fly all the way to Texas. Dafuq? But then somehow miss all the most blatant evidence. The ending is SO anticlimactic. I was hoping for at least a good twist. But no. Nada."
46,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27304766-kay,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book has been on TBR for a while but I want to read it before the upcoming Apple TV series airs. The Last Thing He Told Me is set in Sausalito, California, and is a bit of mystery, suspense, and family drama. The story follows Hannah and her stepdaughter Bailey, both left in shambles when Owen disappears after his tech company is raided.Honestly, I couldn't stop listening to this book. The first half is extremely good. Not sure, but I may have rated this higher if I plow through it in one or two sittings. The note, ""Protect Her"" repeated throughout eventually got on my nerves... and I didn't feel the second half and the reveal rings true. I almost wish Owen ran because of a different reason. I liked the ending and the bond that grew between Hannah and Bailey so I'm going to bump it up. 3.5⭐"

The Last Thing He Told Me
, asks the question, how well do we really know the people we love?Once again, the one book I didn’t pick as part of my Book of the Month box in May was the one giving me FOMO! I’m so glad I picked this up because it was so good.Hannah never thought she’d get married, and she was fine was that. But then she met Owen and she realized she’d found the man she wanted to spend her life with. And despite his teenage daughter, Bailey, resenting her, their first year of marriage has been a good one.One day she gets a message from Owen that says “Protect her.” Then he disappears, just as the software company he worked for is raided by the FBI. Was he complicit in the things they say his company did? Why did he run? And should she trust the U.S. marshal who seems to know more than he’s saying?As Hannah realizes that Owen isn’t whom he said he was, while there are implications for her and her marriage, there are even greater ones for Bailey. Has her whole life been a lie? Together they try to figure out the truth, unaware of just what that will mean for them.“That’s how you fill in the blanks—with stories and memories from the people who love you. If they lie to you, like he did, who are you then? Who is he?”
The Last Thing He Told Me
 is part-mystery, part-thriller, but it’s also an introspective story, a look at love and relationships and truth and doing everything for those you love. The pacing is slow at times and fast at others, but I was totally hooked on the story.I know it’s been optioned for a television movie and that totally makes sense.

This was not a super suspenseful, keep you on the edge of your seat book. This is a slow burn with the storyline unfolding slowly taking some time to get to the plot. It has a lot of family drama added in. I enjoyed it with the exception of a couple parts that were too slow for me. The ending was very bittersweet and I found myself wishing for a different ending. It was very anti-climatic and I guess I was just hoping for a bit better of an ending. Overall, a good read and I would recommend. Thank you Simon & Schuster and Net Galley for the ARC in return for my honest review."
51,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15907994-joanna-chu-the-chuseyreader,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5 StarsWhat I enjoyed:• I enjoyed part 1 as the book dived straight into it so I was hooked and interested from the get go. • The characters were likeable and realistic, especially Hannah. I enjoyed the story from her point of view because I was able to connect with her. She's a normal person in an unlikely situation and was so out of her depth. Her thoughts, reactions and actions felt realistic and she didn’t do anything that was so far-fetched or crazy. • The relationship development between Hannah and her step daughter Bailey was wholesome. At the start, Bailey was an annoying and bratty teenager, however I enjoyed how they began to lean on and support each other. And in the end Bailey called her mum. What I didn't enjoy:• After part 1 I felt pretty neutral for the rest of the book. The investigation was boring, it felt like they were trying to find a needle in a haystack. The discoveries felt so forced because they were so random, grasping at the distant past hoping to spark memories and recalling everyday conversations.• There was no real tension or urgency to find Owen. For example, there was no indication that anyone was in immediate trouble, the detectives made an appearance at the start only and were nonexistent for the rest so they didn’t add more pressure. Essentially nothing felt time critical.• The reveal about Owen’s true past was anticlimactic as there was no mystery built around it. There were little to no clues so it could have been anything and I would have felt the same - Neutral rather than surprised.Not what I expected:• The genre. This is not so much a thriller or suspense but more of a slow paced domestic mystery. I was never at the edge of my seat and after part 1 I wasn’t dying to know what happens next.The dual timeline focused more on the relationships and didn’t build up any mystery. I was expecting to see more bread crumbs and clues. Eyebrow raising moments:• Tobias Cookman talked about why Owen was the worst student he had ever had and I found it hilarious and ridiculous when he said that Owen had been failing because of a popular girl in class. I thought WHAT?! When I look back at my own university days, I would be surprised if professors could name all the students in their class, let alone know who was popular with the boys? Owen had also told/emailed him that he was failing because he was in love. I just thought...wow...there was a time in my life where I almost failed all 4 subjects (P’s get degrees haha), maybe I should’ve emailed my professors my life problems and seen if they’d have any sympathy for me. I can’t imagine any student doing that! I felt that they had a student - teacher relationship so I found this whole part really weird. • If Grady wanted to get Hannah and Bailey into witness protection why couldn't he have told Hannah the truth from the start? • The vague notes left behind. Surely he had an extra 1 minute to write a bit more. • When Hannah hung up on Evelyn. I found that extremely rude considering she had bent the rules to help them lol! Talk about being used and thrown away!You will like this if: You love stories that are more focused on family drama and relationships rather than the thrills or mystery build up.Review Website | Bookstagram"

And so, we have the story of Hannah, her husband, Owen, and Bailey, the daughter. It’s a shaky relationship, one that Hannah seems smart enough to distance herself from, but then circumstances force the two ladies to become intertwined with one another in ways they had never foreseen.For Owen has gotten in a jam, trouble with a capital T, and the only words he disappears with is “protect her.”As the two surmount obstacles to their being together their main focus is the why of Owen’s disappearance. Yes, the company he worked for is in deep trouble with more federal agencies breathing down their necks, but could Owen ever be the person he is presumed to be?There’s a plethora of things going on as the author weaves a tale of deception, hidden agendas, with the prevailing questions circling around. The importance of Owen’s words become clearer the closer Hannah and Bailey get to the truth.These ladies especially Hannah are smart and perceptive but also are in peril in all they uncover.Will Hannah be able to protect a daughter that is not hers? Will she find the man she loves or will life continue to be a downward spiral into a web of nightmares?Jan and I so enjoyed the time we spent with this story and loved that the author kept us befuddled and in the dark. Definitely recommend this one for its cleverness and plot that had one playing the “whatever happened?” roulette."

56,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11232712-joey-r,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.0 stars—“The Last Thing He Told Me” by Laura Dave is the first book I have ever read by Ms Dave— as I believe this is her first thriller. Ms. Dave is a very accomplished writer, and I thoroughly enjoyed the story. The book is written from the perspective of Hannah, who recently married Owen, and became a stepmother to his daughter, Bailey. The story begins with Hannah receiving a hand written note from Owen to “Protect her.” (obviously referring to his daughter Bailey). The book then begins unfolding the mystery of the disappearance of Owen and how Hannah proceeds to investigate the reason for his disappearance and whereabouts. The author does a good job at keeping the pace of the book moving, and the mystery of Owen’s disappearance ongoing throughout the book. It reminded me of a better novel by Harlan Coben for the majority of the book. Only the convoluted and predictable ending that has been done (better) numerous times before keeps this book from getting a higher rating. All in all a good book from an author I definitely want to read again."

61,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4876540-jonetta,Rating 4 out of 5,"the setup…Hannah Hall is a talented woodworker who met her husband Owen Michaels when she was living in New York. After they married, she joined him and his sixteen-year old daughter Bailey in Sausalito, living on their houseboat. Bailey’s mother died in an accident when she was a toddler but the teen isn’t keen on having a stepmother. One year later, Hannah gets a handwritten note from Owen, delivered rather strangely, saying simply, “Protect her.” She knows he’s referring to Bailey but beyond that she’s clueless. However, as the FBI and a mysterious US Marshal descend upon her after arresting Owen’s boss, things become clearer. As Hannah probes and tries to find Owen, the clues lead her to another town in another state and the recognition that Owen wasn’t who he claimed to be and Bailey unwittingly seems to hold the proverbial key. the heart of the story…There’s no lead up to anything unusual in Owen’s behavior before he disappeared so I was depending on Hannah to provide clues and insights to get my bearings. As she begins her search for him, Hannah revisits the past as she finds herself in curious situations, jogging her memory about snippets he shared with her about his past, beyond the fictional resume he created. It took me a bit to grasp that this was more than just an attempt to escape potential workplace fraud or embezzlement. When the US Marshal showed up, that shifted the story into new and puzzling directions. I loved how Hannah’s first instinct was to keep Bailey safe, despite the teen’s surly behavior towards her, sacrificing her own agenda for Owen’s beloved child. She made smart deductions and trusted those instincts to put Bailey first. the narration…I enjoyed the narrator’s performance, particularly the storytelling style, told without a lot of drama even when she could have exploited that at so many opportunities. It worked best for the story.the bottom line…This was so much more than what I thought this story would be, lacking predictability so much that I had no clue as to where it might lead almost to the moment it landed somewhere meaningful. Hannah was an interesting character, fairly laid back with a creative soul, which made her an ideal investigator. She didn’t rattle easily and was thoughtful not only in assembling clues but in handling the difficult Bailey. I enjoyed the journey, even though at times it could be maddening how reflections could be repetitive and delay revelations right before they were made. It affected the pacing but not enough to detract from my overall enjoyment. I also liked how Hannah and Bailey’s relationship evolved, both forced to trust one another when it wasn’t easy to do for either of them. The ending is complex and fit Hannah’s nature and mission to first protect Bailey. I was hanging on through the very last word! This lived up to the hype. 4.5 starsPosted on Blue Mood Café(Thanks to Simon & Schuster Audio for my complimentary copy. All opinions are my own.)"

Yes, my friends, the FOMO, she is real. And me????? Well . . . . . 

My debilitating condition is not helped by things like Reese’s Book Club or Read With Jenna or Book of the Month either. Much like Pokemon, I gotta catch read ‘em all! And sometimes they aren’t winners. Don’t get me wrong, the pages turned quickly enough on this one, but the premise (and I’m going to try my best to not present any spoilsies) that a husband leaves his life, his wife, his daughter and only a note to “Protect Her” was maybe just a weeeeeeee too Lifetime Television for Women for me. As the story developed, it became even more farfetched that this particular gentleman would have even put himself in such a potentially high-profile position he did to begin with and, well . . . . 

That cover tho . . . . I actually just got scolded (lightheartedly) by one of my real-life friends for being such an easy sell when it comes to house covers. My defense???? But this had a houseBOAT on the cover. And then I promptly read How Lucky which also had a house on the cover and requested The Perfect Family on NetGalley because it had a house on the cover. It’s a sickness.Everyone else seems to really love this one. I’ll gladly take the wrongreader title with my mediocre rating."
64,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11701608-barbara,Rating 4 out of 5,"“The Last Thing He Told Me” by Laura Dave is a satisfying domestic thriller of a novel. It revolves around Hannah, a woman who married (a year ago) a widower with a teenage daughter. Hannah was raised by her grandfather after her own mother left her. Hannah is no stranger to the issues of an abandoned child. She marries Owen Michaels, a charming and incredibly intelligent coder for a tech firm in northern California. Owen has a daughter, Bailey, who isn’t pleased about her father’s marriage. Bailey lost her mother when she was four and has little memory of her mother. Bailey and Own have been on their own for a decade so teenage Bailey treats Hannah as an interloper.The story opens with an unknown twelve-year-old girl giving Hannah a message on a piece of yellow legal paper. The message is short and from Owen. “Protect Her” is all it says. Hannah is confused, and all her calls to Owen go unanswered. Life becomes stranger when Hannah retrieves Bailey from school, and Bailey has a duffle full of money that Owen left in her locker.Owen vanishes after the company he worked for becomes under SEC investigation for fraud. To add to Hannah’s stress, she gets visits from the Feds. Hannah soon realizes that Owen has some secrets; in fact, most of what he told her are lies. As Hannah and Bailey do their own sleuthing to figure out who and what Owen is hiding from, we get the back story of Hannah’s life before Owen and her romance with Owen. This is a perfectly paced thriller that keeps the reader involved. Beyond the thriller part, Dave works in Hannah’s observations of her life and her marriage with Owen. Dave writes Hannah as a strong woman, not just one who seemed to be duped. For example, once she comes to terms with the fact that Owen isn’t who she thought he was, her inner musing:“Owen isn’t who I thought he was, at least in the details. There are parts I wish didn’t exist, parts I can’t look away from now. In one way or another, this is the deal we all sign when we love someone….It’s the deal we all sign again and again to keep that love. We don’t turn away from the parts of someone we don’t want to see.”I found Hannah’s thoughts kept me involved. I’m not a fan of stupid female characters who are duped because they are desperate or needy. Hannah reflected much on her marriage with Owen and what she should have known. Dave knows teen girls, as Bailey is written perfectly with her snarky comments one minute and neediness the next.I enjoyed the story and the pacing. The flaw I found is the sleuthing that Hannah and Bailey did. Hannah negotiates their way out of suspicious situations which I found implausible. Thrillers generally need to have an unrealistic bent, so I forgive Dave. Julia Roberts and Reese Witherspoon intend to turn the story into a TV series. I always prefer to read the novel before I see the Hollywood rendition. "

After all, he left his daughter Bailey in her care along with a note with two words written on it: “Protect Her.” Bailey is left with much more… a duffel bag full of money in her locker at school. Nothing will ever be the same again. Bailey has never gotten along all that well with her stepmother Hannah,.. but now, they are all each other has and they must work together to find out what happened. The relationship between Hannah and Bailey was one of my favorite things about this novel. Complex, interesting, and refreshingly honest. Another thing that I loved is that part of this book takes place in Austin, Texas where I used to live, thus I could picture the sites and sounds, perfectly. A mystery/suspense that kept my attention. Considering everything that is going on in the world lately, that is a HUGE feat as most books bore me to tears lately. Kudos to Laura Dave for keeping me in suspense the entire time! The audiobook was narrated by Rebecca Lowman who did a brilliant job as well. Thank you to my local library for loaning me a copy of the audio.Published on Goodreads and Twitter."

Does Hannah protect her? This is the most interesting part of the story. It’s a fresh take on that “stepmother” trope and the story centres around the relationship between Hannah and Bailey as they track down the truth as to why Owen disappeared. The Last Thing He Told Me is a solid, slow-building mystery that explores secrets, lies, love, trust, and faith in a marriage. It explores the dynamics between stepmother and child, and that is the driving force of the story. I loved the relationship between Hannah and Owen’s daughter Bailey and the bond they developed. The story exams the character’s motivations, and their development results from the bond that is developed. ALL the characters are likeable from start to finish.We learn the mystery of Owen’s disappearance through Hannah as she does. We see her past dynamics with Owen as her narrative alternates from past and present. We learn of her early days with Owen alongside with her current hunt for him. The pacing is slow and never really picked up for me, even with the twists and climax of the story. The suspense is light, and the danger is moderate. The stakes are not high until Hannah learns the truth, and even then, there was not enough tension to keep this dark and twisted reader on the edge of my chair, gripping my kindle. Even through this one was not the best for me, I do consider it one of the better reads and I recommend for reader who enjoy likeable characters and a good easy, entertaining solid lighter mystery that you go along for the ride rather than the thrill.I received a copy form the publisher through NetGalley."

Written on a scrap of paper delivered to her door by a young school girl on the day he disappeared. Hannah doesn't know why he's run away, but the boss of the software company he works at has just been arrested for fraud, so could Owen be mixed up in corporate crime as well?Married to Owen for only a year, Hannah knows exactly who Owen means in his note - his sixteen year old daughter Bailey, now Hannah's moody teenage step-daughter. Bailey's mother, Owen's first wife, died when she was young and he has always tried to put her first and be the best father he can. Hannah wants to find him desperately, as do the FBI and a US Marshal from Texas, which Hannah finds strange since they live in Sausilito. And then her lawyer calls to tell her that Owen might not be the man she thought he was. The mystery unravels gradually as Hannah and Bailey set out on a quest to discover who Owen really is and what he's been hiding from them, setting in motion revelations that will change all their lives. Hannah is a strong and resourceful character with a resilience that Bailey comes to admire, gradually drawing the two of them together into a closer family unit. The well written, interesting plot with a light touch of suspense keeps the reader guessing making for a fast, addictive read.With thanks to Serpent's Tail and Netgalley for a copy to read"

Unfortunately, it didn't quite work for me 😏.Hannah and Bailey play detective as they go in search for answers. They need to find Owen, who suddenly disappeared and left them nothing but a note and money. It's a race to find answers before getting caught! All while having to figure out who they can and cannot trust. Seems interesting, right?Unfortunately, the delivery fell flat. This is pretty much a long-winded and somewhat unrealistic story. If not for the short chapters, I would've probably given up on this one. For me, this was the opposite of an unputdownable book; it took me twenty days to read this one 😬."
70,no user info,Rating 1 out of 5,"I'm really in the minority here and I don't quite get how this book is getting such good reviews. I have it at a 1 - maybe I could possibly go up to a 1.5. Now maybe, part of that rating is in part because the book I read prior was a book of literary fiction that I absolutely loved and found incredibly well written and well crafted and as such it made the inadequacies of The Last Thing He Told Me all the more glaring. Let's start with the characters - they weren't unlike-able, they weren't like-able, they were just bland and not quite fully formed. Then the plot - ugh. I get that in a book of this genre, you have to suspend disbelief, but the writing here was not interesting enough or clever enough to do so. Our main character Hannah, who is trying to track down her missing husband, sees a look come across his best friend's face when she mentions TX - a light bulb goes off and she travels there and in the course of a day and half of very lucky sleuthing she sweet talks several characters (including one with mob ties) into spilling the tea that can solve the mystery. All a bit too convenient, in part because it felt like I was reading the outline for the book instead of a real book. And how many times did someone say 'if you only knew what your husband did' - only to never to reveal what those things were. Was the husband a good guy?, a bad guy? somewhere in between? Who knows, because you never got to know him "

It's just...something I've seen done before and something I've been done BETTER before, so why should I bother with this story?I was kind of interested in the whole defrauding company plotline with the husband, especially based on what's going on with the stock market now in 2021, but...yeah, having to follow it through Hannah's first person P.O.V. just made me roll my eyes and slog through each page slowly as heck. Like...snail speed and even then I still DNFed it and gave up, Netgalley freebie be darned!Maybe for someone who cares only about the plot and not about the protagonist, this is a recommended read. Maybe. Myself, I'm far too pick not to care about all of the above, therefore a DNF is well-deserved from my point of view if it's on my shelves.One word to end off on this review: N-E-X-T!"

Idk I just didn’t like how the book ended. After all of that, I expected something stronger and more impactful? I also would’ve loved to see some character development. The idea itself was interesting, but some parts just felt kinda flat and I wasn’t really as emotionally invested as I hoped I’d be. Overall, It was an okay quick read."

It’s the deal we have to sign again and again to keep that love. We don’t turn away from the parts of someone we don’t want to see. However quickly or long it takes to see them. We accept them if we are strong enough. Or we accept them enough to not let the bad parts become the entire story.”I actually liked this a lot more than I originally anticipated, and in fact- it wasn’t at all the story I thought it would be. I was under the impression it was a thriller of a new wife whose husband goes missing & she’s left with his teenage daughter who dislikes her but will band together to discover who may have hurt her father. In some ways, that’s exactly what this was. In reality, it was much more a story about learning to love someone who may have lied to you to keep you safe & their attempt of discovering the truth and why he would do such a thing. Now mix that with a really sweet story of the wife learning to be the kind of person the teenage daughter needs and them slowly building their trust in each other. And add a dash of crime & detective work. I loved what this story had to say & truly loved the way it ended."
74,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35362731-tamar-playing-hooky-for-a-few-hours-today,Rating 4 out of 5,"I read this book in one day and I chose it because of the wonderful reviews it received and the fact that it was voted GR best choice mystery & suspense winner of 2021 (do you feel a but coming?). The book was a gripper, for sure, or I would not have dropped everything for 24 hours to finish, especially considering my serious lack of free time these days. (here it comes) But when I sat down to review, I drew a complete blank. I mean, for a few minutes I could not even remember the plot. Now this could be because of my advancing years OR it could be that the book just wasn’t as great for me as I thought it was while I was racing furiously to the finish line.The story is well crafted, but the bottom line is I found it far-fetched. At this point I have to defer to a quote from the e.e. cummings poem chosen by the author as an epigraph to her novel:let’s go said henot too far said shewhat’s too far said hewhere you are said sheI always have reservations when I read a book where the heroine (or hero) is better equipped to follow up leads than the detectives – or in this case, the FBI or a U.S. Marshal. Hannah is a woodturner. For those of you, like me, who do not know what that is exactly, or who assume it to be a wood carver or whittler, woodturning is a wood craft which employs a spinning lathe and carving tools (thank you Google). Hannah is not merely a woodturner, but rather a maestro in her field, her clients numbering among the rich and famous. Her works feature on the covers of the most popular trade magazines in her field. She is married to Owen who is also a genius in his field (mathematician/CTO?). BTW, this plot would have worked just as well if both Hannah and Owen were average middle-class Joes. For me, the glitz detracts and makes the story less believable. The plot: rich and famous High-Tech magnate, Avett Thompson, owner of The Shop, his latest Start-Up, is about to make a killing with his newest app. He shows up at Hannah’s workshop to have a look at the latest piece of furniture his wife has ordered for their home. His wonderboy employee, Owen, is tagging along. Owen chats up Hannah and before you know it, they are happily married and living on a houseboat in Sausalito with his sixteen-year-old daughter, Bailey. Saint Hannah shows remarkable restraint and love (worthy of several eyerolls) for this difficult teen who basically wants no part of her. Several pages later, Owen is gone! He appears to have flown the coop leaving Hannah with only the cryptic message, “protect her”, and Bailey with $650,000 in cash, stuffed into a black duffle bag. Once she learns that Avett and his company are under SEC investigation for defrauding his shareholders to the tune of several billion dollars, Hannah is even more worried when a U.S. Marshal shows up on her porch and later the FBI, each seemingly with a different agenda. Who can she trust? Trust no one, the Marshal warns her, and thus begins her journey into wide blue yonder – a trip that brings Hannah and Bailey closer as they search for the missing Owen. As the two attempt to unravel the mystery of Owen, they work together as a team and learn to trust each other (does this sound like I’m reviewing a Nicholas Oldland picture book for kids?). There are lots of surprises, including the ending. My eyes did roll a few times during Hannah’s meeting with a family patriarch, legal counsel for “the Mob”. But altogether this was a fun, page-flipping read. After glancing at the thrillers I read that were published last year, I would have to agree that this was one of the better ones.I both listened to the audio and read the ebook - depending on what I was doing while reading/listening. If you plan to listen I suggest speeding up to 1.2. Slower than that was plodding."

77,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7407123-pat,Rating 3 out of 5,"As I missed the arc boat I got this one from the library to see what all the fuss was about. It seems to be quite a polarising book. I do agree it was well written but it also required monster disbelief suspenders!Before Owen Michaels disappears for good he manages to get a note delivered to his wife of 2 years, Hannah, that simply says “protect her”. Hannah knows he means his 16 year old daughter, Bailey, who lost her mother at a young age. Unfortunately Bailey wants nothing to do with her step mother - that part is easy to understand! What I struggled with is the decisions and the path that these two took to try and find out where Owen is and why he disappeared. One thing they did know was the company he was working was for being investigated for fraud.Owen also left something else behind which I can’t tell you about but when Hannah and Bailey head on their journey of discovery they just leave this thing under the kitchen sink - despite the fact that they have already been questioned by a US Marshall and a couple of FBI agents! What the actual f*** was Hannah thinking?Their quest takes them to Texas and they soon learn that Owen was not who they thought he was. At which point I would have turned around and moved a long way away. Anyway, they find a whole bunch of unpalatable answers even though Hannah’s faith in the intrinsic goodness of her husband is not shaken and she ends up making a deal with devil. I thought it was an OK story but a bit fantastical."

Whelp, this was the case with The Last Thing He Told Me. I initially gave it 3 stars, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized that this was worse that okay for me (3 stars is my standard rating for an ""okay"" read).So, why didn't I like it.... first, THIS IS NOT A THRILLER! This is a slow-burn domestic drama/ mystery. Which is okay, but I was definitely expecting a more pulse-pounding page turner. The book started out fine, but started going downhill once we find out the general reason for Owen being missing. Things became WAY to convoluted for me. A lot of the mystery unfolded based on Bailey remembering VERY specific things from when she was FOUR years old. I don't always mind super unbelievable plot points if the book is entertaining, but this was not the case here. I have seen a lot of reviews saying how much they loved Hannah's character - to me, she was a decent character, but very boring - I didn't get a lot of depth from her. I also hated the ending.I did really enjoy the settings of Sausalito, California (the house boats were cool!), and Austin, Texas. I also liked seeing Hannah and Bailey's relationship develop. Unfortunately, I think this author is just not for me. This was the fourth book of hers that I've read, and the only one I liked was Eight Hundred Grapes (I decided to give this one a chance because of rave reviews and the fact that it was labeled as a thriller). Please take my review with a grain of salt, as everyone else seems to be loving it!Thank you to Goodreads and Simon & Schuster for the ARC!"
79,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22727329-victoria,Rating 4 out of 5,"Domestic suspense when done well makes for a page turning read while providing insights into the characters and their relationships. While the plot revolves around a missing husband, it is the women and their relationship that is portrayed in all of its frustrating and budding glory. Even when the mystery goes into familiar territory, Dave has a few new twists, some difficult choices and doesn’t shy away from an ending that is not storybook. The final word brought me to tears, how many novels of suspense can say that?Laura Dave excelled in this one and in a new genre at that. There are so many great reviews for this book, I can’t add more to the discussion. This was a gripping tale that left me with the ultimate question, what would I do?"
80,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/121053046-stacy-dean,Rating 2 out of 5,"I had really high hopes for this book, mainly because of all the great reviews and the cute little “Reese’s Book Club” sticker on the front. I mean, the first review on the back of the book calls it “A thrilling roller coaster of a novel.” So...you know, I was hyped. Now, the set up and first act of the book I really liked! Husband goes missing, 2 clue notes and a bag of money left behind. A race to figure out what happened before the authorities, aka 2 FBI agents, 1 mysterious US Marshal and the news headlines at every Google news click nipping at their heels. Here’s my problem with this book: it fell so flat in the second half. I wouldn’t call this a roller coaster, I would call this a lucky stroll around Austin Texas finding out very convenient answers to ultimately boring questions. This book had a huge need for pacing, some kind of ticking time bomb to go up against and a formidable antagonist. Instead the FBI agents disappeared, the US Marshal turned out to be holding the answers of the past close to his vest for no reason at all. I mean, what was the point in pretending with Hannah? Just tell her Owen’s past and catch everyone up to speed! I thought for so long that Grady would be the leak at WITSEC. He was so angry at Hannah that they couldn’t find Owen that I was sure he wanted revenge or something interesting. But no. He was just annoying and fairly inconsequential to the plot. There was just no outside threat to our central characters that moved the story along in an urgent way. Why not have them on the run to Austin, dodging authorities and scrambling to figure these clues out? This was the number one news article in the country and they were allowed to just joyride around Texas for a bit? I really loved the church database hunting, and tracking the old professor down at college, all of that felt really juicy! But then came the answers, and I had to reread them several times because they were so...lack luster! I thought the whole time Owen had kidnapped Bailey as a little girl to protect her from bad guys or something. But it was just a straight witness protection story?? And Owen’s master plan was to just disappear forever once his very high profile job blew up in his face? If his daughter was everything to him, why not try a nice little quiet life job and keep a low profile? And why tell Hannah 2 words of an explanation?! “Protect her.” Thanks Owen. Clear as mud. Sigh. So many plot holes and I haven’t even gotten to the baddie grandpa who somehow ends up with his granddaughter in the end but not Owen?! On what planet would Bailey be okay with weekend visits to iHop with the man who was the catalyst for never seeing her father ever again? 😳Overall this was a huge disappointment to me. I think the “twist” everyone was raving about was the fact that nothing actually happened, surprise! Side note: The most unbelievable part of this story? That a professor who has a framed exam on his office wall for years can’t remember the name of that student. 🎤"

Spoiler warning!!
The Last Thing He Told Me is what appears to be a thriller but is also very much a family drama. Hannah lives with her husband, Owen, and Owen’s daughter, Bailey, in a houseboat in small-town Sausalito, California. Owen works for a tech startup doing software engineering, while Hannah’s a wood craftsman who specializes in furniture. It’s a happy marriage, with the only challenge being Hannah trying to win over a wary teenaged Bailey. It’s a normal life, a quaint existence, at first glance. Until it isn’t. One day, Owen doesn’t come home, and Hannah and Bailey find themselves on the run. Owen’s tech startup was doctoring the books before its imminent IPO and top executives are being indicted and arrested one by one. The last thing Owen told Hannah, via a cryptic note, was to “protect her”—Bailey—whom he’d do anything for. Owen has disappeared, appearing to be on the run. 



“This feels impossible. Every bit of this feels impossible. How do you begin to grapple with the idea that your husband is running from the person he used to be, a person whose real name you don’t even know? You want to argue that someone is getting your story wrong. In your story, the one you know by heart, none of this makes sense. Not where this story began, not where it’s going. And certainly not where it’s threatening to end.”



I think this is where I ended up docking my rating of the book from four stars to three-and-a-half stars—because of the whole “your loved one isn’t who they say they are” trope. I almost lost interest in the story there, worried it was going to be a predictable family drama from there, mysteries uncovered that are not actually mysteries. Yet, the author navigated the tightrope of engaging thriller and family story fairly well, preventing either element from bogging down The Last Thing He Told Me too much. Hannah and Bailey end up in Owen’s old haunt of Austin, Texas. As amateur as they were at being detectives—compared with the FBI agents and US Marshals Office on Owen’s case—they uncover family ties to criminal organizations. And I thought they made a great team, even if they seemed to be almost too good at times, picking up on things experienced investigative professionals didn’t (another trope that can be easily mishandled or overused). I suppose I won’t quibble on that too much—since they blundered badly, dare I say, realistically, at times throughout their journey: Bailey goes missing and Hannah puts her life on the line and makes a deal with the devil to get Bailey back and keep her safe, what Owen would want. The Last Thing He Told Me is a family-driven drama/thriller that may tread familiar ground narrative-wise, but manages to, at the end, stand on its own.-CoraFind this book and other titles within our catalog.

There was a lot more internal monologue going on, so the action was slower. I needed to find out what happened to Owen and if everyone was going to stay safe. What in the world is going on- that was my biggest question during most of this book. The main character is truly likeable and her character development is strong. Cryptic notes, a bag full of money and a missing husband is how this book starts out. Soon, an US Marshall and FBI Agents are added along with shady people that Hannah is not sure she can trust.Definitely an interesting read. I would recommend as long as your okay with a bit slower of a book and answers that are not revealed until toward the very end. I enjoyed this book!"

I partially listened to the audiobook (which was well done) and read from the book at other times. Despite the slower pace, which I did not mind at all, I still managed to finish this one in a day. I thought this one was good, but not great, and I was surprised to find out it won the GR Choice award for the thriller of the year. That being said, I enjoyed watching Hannah's relationship with her step-daughter Bailey evolve over the course of the story, and I thought the ending was very satisfying. 3.5 stars rounded up. "

When he disappears, leaving behind his 16 year old daughter, Bailey and his wife, Hannah, it is a race for time to find out what is going on. The only revelation he was alive when he dropped $60,000 off with his daughter and a note ""protect her"". Bailey lost her mother when she was a toddler, so this is too much to cope with losing her dad also.

98,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44279580-tracy,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Last Thing He Told Me by Laura Dave was much more exciting and thought provoking than I could have imagined. The story starts out introducing us to Hannah Hall, who clearly adores her husband of one year, Owen Michaels. She also desperately wants to gain the affections of Owen's 16-year-old daughter, Bailey, who is churlish and makes it clear she has no intentions of welcoming her into the fold with open arms anytime soon. Even though there are some road-bumps within the new family unit, they are - for the most part - a content one. They live in a posh houseboat in Sausalito; Hannah has a rather successful career as a woodturner - a skill handed down by her beloved grandfather, who also raised her - and her furniture is sought after by some of the most rich and famous. Owen is also extremely successful in his career working for a successful tech firm called The Shop. Until one day, out of the blue, their lives are turned upside down when Hannah receives a note from Owen saying ""Protect her"". Unable to reach him via phone, she is becoming increasing concerned and begins questioning how well she really knows Owen, but refuses to believe he the man she adores and chose as her life partner. Meanwhile, Bailey discovers a bag full of hundreds of thousands of dollars which Owen left in her school locker before disappearing. Soon thereafter, they find out The CEO of The Shop has been apprehended by law enforcement. To Hannah's dismay, she learns that the firm has been under surveillance by the FBI for close to a year for reasons concerning special state-of-the-art software The Shop began selling before it was completely operative and spiraled into misrepresenting their financial documentations. Hannah adamantly refuses to believe Owen would ever defraud anyone, and a U.S. marshal working the case also agrees Owen is not a suspect. Hannah has no idea who she can count on to tell her the truth and acting in good faith. Through it all, Bailey and she decide to do whatever it takes to dig up any information which could put them on a trail to locating Owen. Hannah and Bailey must learn to count on each other. Hannah's fictive switches back and forth between past and present, highlighting the infancy of her relationship with Owen parallel to her present search for him. There are a couple of precarious situations and a scattering of shockers. Notwithstanding, what really propels the plot is the developing essence of Hannah and Bailey's connection, which is alternately affecting and exasperating yet always authentic. Narrator Rebecca Lowman could not have provided a more satisfying listening experience and I could not imagine a better voice for this novel."

If that was the author’s main intention then, in my opinion, I think that she did a good job.Regardless, the development is not very thrilling but it is at the same time, far from boring.Now, about the storyline, it’s been done before. There is nothing new or outstanding. And the ending was too abrupt and unsatisfying (to me).I heard that this work is going to be adapted for the TV, having Julia Roberts as the protagonist (Julia Roberts and Reese Whiterspoon are two of the producers).Some authors (Ruth Ware, as a quick example) are so lucky."
102,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9980722-shanae,Rating 2 out of 5,"The first half is good, the second half is horrible. I hate books where people are savvier than they should be or more noble than they would be. I makes for great allegories but terrible novels. The build up is just simply not worth it. It's like the author did no research into how crime syndicates work. She pulled the most shallow material she could think of, likely based off something she watched on law & order, and then surrounded the story with flimsy innuendo so that she didn't actually have to get into depth about the characters, the crimes or the motives.Spoilers below  Hannah is a woodworker. She marries Owen who is a tech WonderWorker and he has a bitchy little teenage daughter Bailey. I don't feel at all bad about calling her that- because she is. That's the other thing: it is so apparent to me that this author has either no experience with teenagers or only bad experience. whenever a teenager is written as petulant and self-righteous and self-involved as an author can possibly make them, I know that they have no experience. Yes teenagers can be those things, but they can also be hilarious helpful and surprisingly delightful. It was just a huge huge annoyance of mine throughout the whole book. Owen goes missing. His business is in trouble for some type of genetic federal financing crime. That basically never comes back into it which is really really really really really really odd. It's sold that he is just this tech savant... And then that never ends up mattering whatsoever in the end.Long story short, Owen runs. On very flimsy information Hannah decides to try to track down information of him in Austin Texas with his daughter in tow. I'm still in it at this point.Then it rapidly loses me. They stumble upon information about him having sold out people in a crime syndicate but they absolutely point blank refused to tell us all the bad stuff that he did. Then she immediately, and with no character build-up, becomes super mom. She is literally willing to sacrifice her entire life's existence for her 2-year-old marriage and his 16-year-old brat. She's more benevolent of a mother than women who raise their own children would be. She's amazing. She's so loving. She's so brave.Also, there's this US Marshal guy who plays this really confusing role where he claims to have a ton of information about Owen but she doubts his information... And then they never explain what it is one way or the other and why this guy is so invested.Ugh if it's just... Just... Just no. "

NOTHING HAPPENS IN THIS STORY!!!! I think we should start with the first big problem… the husband. The story starts right away with WHAM the husbands gone… okay cool, that’s fun right?! Wrong! We never meet the husband and honestly don’t get that much info on him and we’re just expected to love him too? Because our main character Hannah does? Yeah, that’s not how this works. Which leads me to problem two. Hannah. Hannah is on this fact finding mission the whole time. She’ll legit get so close to an answer, AND THEN GOES THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION! Like what?! At one point Bailey (the daughter) says “we’re so close”, and she’s just like yeah, but we gotta go. SERIOUSLY!?! Now on to problem three, the whole premise of this story. Laura Dave does do a good job of hooking you in, and by that I mean she does have you wanting to find out what happened to the husband. HOWEVER, she does a horrible job once she gets to the big reveal. She builds it up, and up, and up- then finally get to the big moment and… NOTHING. The “twist”…
The last 30% of this book feels useless, pointless, and the writing style feels so disconnected from the first half.There is also a fast forward in time at the end (I don’t think that’s a spoiler), and I don’t know why, but when the daughter sees Hannah and says “Hi mom” I legit 
I can’t believe this is what we got after all the build up. After all the hype around this books. I’m even more confused on how it won an award for it.

❝Protect her.❞

The Last Thing He Told Me was a truly riveting read! I read it in only one day, and I very rarely read books that quickly these days. I just couldn’t stop reading it, I was absolutely hooked!!This book single-handendly got me out of my Crooked Kingdom book hangover, so for that alone it deserves four stars tbh :’)The Last Thing He Told Me is a testament to the power of family. The things we do for the ones we love — the lengths we go for their happiness and safety, and the things we must sacrifice along the way. Some people will do anything for love, or in the name of love.
❝It’s a terrible thing to know everything about someone long after you want to.❞
I really liked the book’s ending! It surprised me, and it wasn’t cliche at all. It was a quite a bittersweet ending… Like I’m happy for Hannah and Bailey, and their flourishing mother-daughter relationship. But I’m also sad for Hannah and Owen, and at the fact that they will never be able to be together again...

Flashbacks tell about Owen and Hannah before his disappearance.The book is more than a suspenseful mystery.

""Owen's note is short. One line, its own puzzle. Protect her.""
This was an excellent page-turner: a wonderful character-driven mystery that sucked me in from the very beginning. It keeps you wondering and guessing from the start. Why did Owen disappear? Is he a good guy or a bad one? We discover things as Hannah does, and the book is so engrossing. She and Bailey unravel Owen's past, becoming detectives themselves, and we get snippets from the past they do.It's fascinating trying to piece everything together. I was frantically flipping the pages, and I read this one in only a couple of settings. The language is flowery but absorbing. In addition to the key disappearance, Dave reflects on Hannah's relationships with both Owen and Bailey. If you want to get lost in a good mystery for a couple of days (or hours), I highly recommend this one. Blog ~ Twitter ~ Facebook ~ Instagram ~  PaperBackSwap ~ Smashbomb "
114,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7365405-james,Rating 4 out of 5,"The Last Thing He Told Me by Laura Dern was a Goodreads Choice Award winner for mysteries/thrillers. I wanted to read it when it came out but I had a backlog in queue for other books. Now that I'm caught up, I can revisit all the 2021/2022 hits that I missed... and this was near the top of the list. Dern is a new author to me, and I ultimately enjoyed the book very much. Her writing style was accessible, the descriptions and dialog well balanced. I liked most of the characters but there were several drawn specifically to be caricatures or stereotypes rather than have a full spectrum or range of human emotions. Sometimes you just need those basis tho, so it wasn't too big of an issue.Plotwise, it had merit, though I wasn't keen on the ending (which happens often). Too much left unsaid for me. A woman marries a man who has a teenage daughter. Two years into the marriage, he disappears. We learn he or the president of a company he worked for stole money and faked sales revenue. But as the wife digs deeper, she realizes her husband had been lying about a lot more. She's stuck taking care of his daughter, which is the best part - the relationship between the two feels super real and rewarding. In the end, the truth comes out (left field, but great) and the only way to resolve the conflicts is something that hurts even worse than the truth.

I listened to the audiobook that was masterfully narrated Rebecca Lowman. The plot was well paced and the characters were well developed, complex and quite believable. In addition, the female characters in this book were both strong and determined which are characteristics I admire. The Last Thing He Told Me explored and even questioned the concepts of family, trust, marriage, sacrifices, devotion, forgiveness, and the roles of stepmothers and second wives. Laura Dave wove a suspenseful mystery that grabbed me from the very beginning. It was difficult to stop listening to this audiobook.How well does anyone really know the person they are married to? After a year of marriage, Hannah Hall, was about to find out how well she really knew her husband, Owen Michaels, after he mysteriously disappeared. One night, Owen, just did not come home from work. Owen had worked as an engineer for a software startup when the company was charged with securities fraud. Trying not to panic or jump to conclusions, Hannah tried endlessly to reach Owen on his cell phone with no success. Hannah discovered a note that Owen had left. There were only two words on the note, “Protect Her”. Hannah knew that Owen was referring to his daughter, Bailey, her sixteen year old stepdaughter. Why would Bailey need protection? Then unexpectedly a US Marshall out of Austin, Texas arrived at the house. His interest in Owen and his disappearance raised many questions in Hannah’s mind. Why would a US Marshall from Austin be interested in her husband’s disappearance? Was there a connection between Owen and Austin? Would Bailey be able to put her dislike and distrust for Hannah aside to help her figure out who her father really was and why he disappeared from their lives? Both Hannah’s and Bailey’s relationship was about to be tested beyond any point they could have ever imagined. The Last Thing He Told Me was the first book that I read by Laura Dave. I would definitely look forward to reading other books by her in the future. This book, in my opinion, would make an excellent movie as well. I really enjoyed listening to this audiobook and recommend it very highly."

There are parts I wish didn’t exist, parts I can’t look away from now. In one way or another, this is the deal we all sign when we love someone. For better or worse. It’s the deal we have to sign again and again to keep that love. We don’t turn away from the parts of someone we don’t want to see. However quickly or long it takes to see them. We accept them if we are strong enough. Or we accept them enough to not let the bad parts become the entire story.On the morning her life changed, Hannah Hall gets a note from her husband saying simply “protect her.” Hannah knows the “her” she needs to protect is her sixteen-year-old step-daughter, Bailey Daniels, who has not warmed to Hannah during the year she’s been married to Owen. When Hannah learns that Owen’s company was raided by the SEC and the FBI that same morning, and that he left a bag full of cash for Bailey before he disappeared, Hannah and Bailey realize that Owen is not the husband or father that they thought he was, and that they better figure out why he ran if they want to rebuild their family.The Last Thing He Told Me is a solid, entertaining thriller. The mystery of why Owen ran, and how Hannah and Bailey can deal with the fallout, unfolds in a satisfying way. My only real complaint about the plot is that towards the end Hannah has to make a decision, an impossible choice, but as soon as she makes it, the story lets her off the hook by confirming (to explain how would be a spoiler) that she absolutely made the right decision. I think it would have been far more interesting, and realistic, if she would have had to live with her choice without ever truly knowing if she did the right thing.Still, I enjoyed Hannah and Bailey as characters, and found the initial friction and slow thawing between them very believable. I especially liked the way the flashbacks methodically moved further back in Hannah and Owen’s relationship each time one occurred. And the ending got into my feelings more than I would have expected. Recommended."

But 🤐I liked the familial message tho especially the nuggets of info we get of Hannah + her grandads relationship 🤩 & I did enjoy seeing her relationship with Bailey change - but I deffo think we were only at the tip of the iceberg there. I would have loved to have seen more!I guessed part of the reason for Owen's disappearance but seeing the rest of the puzzle pieces fall into place was an interesting breadcrumb chase and the encounters along the way included some fun interactions - Jake's contributions made me laugh altho they prob weren't supposed to and of course I enjoyed everyone we met in Austen 😄Quick almost one day read, I only managed one chapter (I think) on Friday and devoured the rest yesterday.

I was 　 　 　scared that the wrong person would stay. ❞4.9/5 :)WOW… This book really stood out to me and made its way into my heart... Must I say more?It all started with a strong, solid and tempting prologue that invites you to keep reading. This was told in first person POV from Hannah's perspective. The story was split into three different parts and was easy to follow. It switched between the past and present as they piece together the truth about everything.The characters were likable and dynamic. Their flaws are what make them good and realistic characters. I especially loved seeing how Bailey slowly warms up to Hannah. The details and little gestures make me really happy (happy as a reader and happy for them.) Bailey's whole personality -including flaws because nobody is perfect- is wonderful. She developed so much by the end of the story, making me like her character even more.This book reminds me of how long it's been since I've read a book with actual chapter names. (Not that numbers are bad or anything.) Anyways, I love the chapter titles.There were some minor details that I was confused about, but that didn't affect the plot much. For example, what happened to the bag of money? What was in the piggy bank? Was that the end of The Shop? How are Carl and Patty?The last chapter makes me mad that it ended like that, but I still love it. It's a happy ending, yet it isn't a happy ending… that makes sense, right? The ending keeps you wondering yet isn't too vague that it feels like no thought was put into it. This is the type of ending that I'd like to see in future books.I've got to say, this is my type of book, and it definitely cured my reading slump :)03/01/21*apparently, this is going to be adapted into a film?? 😯 i'm excited about it, yet i'm scared it'll ruin the story…━━━━━━━━━━━༻༻❁༺༺━━━━━━━━━━━ SAME NAME AUTHOR LET'S GOOOI GOT AN ARC! ºoºfinally wasn't rejected~"

In fairness, they're all accurate. If the domestic suspense piece of the story doesn't hook you, then all the relationship building will likely miss its mark. If you are a stepparent or have ever been in a serious relationship with someone who has children, you'll enjoy how the author nails the emotions.Laura Dave does an excellent job here balancing mystery and character development. The story centers around the relationship between a stepmom and a defiant 16-year-old as they struggle to piece together why the latter's father abruptly disappeared, leaving behind only a note that says PROTECT HER.By pure definition, this could fall under thriller or suspense. But I agree with other reviewers that it's more suspense than the advertised thriller. I work in the finance industry and love that this was inspired by the Enron scandal. I also read that this has already been optioned for a TV series for a deal in the 7 figure range and the lead will be played by none other than Julia Roberts. Big score for Laura Dave! Cheers!"

""The could-have-been boys still love you...""
owen would always raise the class to the 'could-have-been boys'. these are the men that hannah either left behind or left her and he would toast them because ""he was grateful to them for not being what I needed, so he got to be the one sitting across from me"" i find that cute af actually and it kinda showed hannah that it was okay to move on, to find happiness with someone elseoverall, satisfying ending, but a lackluster story that was pretty boring tbh"

134,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35942740-obsidian,Rating 1 out of 5,"High key annoyed. This book made no sense and it was repetitive as anything. The plot made me lose several dozen brain cells. I can't even call this a thriller since as many pointed out this was more of a domestic drama. I could see this book getting some play via Lifetime or Netflix and we all would be screaming at the character of Hannah for not making any sense. ""The Last Thing He Told Me"" follows 40 year old Hannah Hall. Hannah we find is married to Owen. Owen has a daughter named Bailey from his first marriage. Hannah gets a note from her husband saying ""Protect her."" and Hannah realizes that she needs to protect Bailey. From there the book follows the mysteries of Owen and what exactly Hannah needs to protect Bailey from. Hannah drove me up the wall. She keeps doing really dumb things and keeps excusing every thing that Owen does and nope, just nope. I also never got a sense of them as a couple. Dave decides to showcase Hannah and Owen's relationship in little vignettes that don't help anything. It doesn't help that we keep hearing how Hannah's mother abandoned her (it's weird the father was just excused) so that means she has to stick with Bailey. Lord. I was tired of it. Hannah needed therapy. The secondary characters except for Bailey don't really work IMHO. Bailey felt real and her reactions were realistic. Maybe if the story had been told from her point of view the book would have worked better. The writing was not great in a lot of places. Others mentioned grammatical mistakes that I found too. Also the book see-saws between the present and whatever past thing/action she had with her and Owen. So you would get a chapter in present day with Hannah ""investigating"" and then it would jump back and have her remembering her and Owen drinking on their little porch or whatever. Those chapters did not help anything. I think what gets me is how terrible the plot got. We start off with a missing father and it looks like it's tied to a financial scandal and then Dave throws something else out and it didn't need it. As some readers said, the first part of the book was interesting with Owen missing. But once we had Hannah turn into super detective the whole book got old quick. The flow was awful. I think everything happened in like a week time period. The setting of California and Texas didn't feel real to me at all. I think Dave was too focused on what people looked like and didn't really think of how both states/cities sounded and felt the same. At least they did to me while reading. The epilogue made me shake my head. I called BS on that whole ending since it didn't even sound realistic even a little bit. "

I listened to it on Audible and the narration was wonderful. I loved how much the adults loved Bailey. How they accepted her exactly as she was.Owen's love was sacrificial and all-encompassing and heartbreaking and just beautiful. But I really loved Hannah's love for Bailey. A stepmother's love can be complicated but man...I love the way she loved Bailey without expectations or conditions. Without terms, ifs, ands, or buts. She loved her more than she loved herself. And that's rare. I don't want to say much because I want you all to experience it the way I did...so I'll just say this. Read it. It's the best book I've read recently.5 stars."

142,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/108887244-anne,Rating 3 out of 5,"“There is nothing I wouldn’t do for my daughter.” The Last Thing He Told Me was a fast read that’s mostly a domestic drama focusing on the stepmother/stepdaughter relationship that evolved and strengthened as they tried to figure out what’s happened to Bailey’s father, Owen, who abruptly disappeared. Set in California and Texas and told in the present by Hannah, Owen’s wife, with an occasional chapter that flashed back to glimpse Owen, Hannah, and Bailey in successively older time periods. While the characters were likeable, I just didn’t connect with them or feel invested in their plight. So much was built up around Hannah’s life – her childhood with her grandfather, her friend Jules, her beginning relationship with Owen – but none of it helped me feel connected to her. Same goes for Owen. We find out about him through the flashbacks but that seemed bland. Bailey’s teenaged angsty act was the only character that seemed realistic, as did the transitioning points she experienced as she bonded with Hannah. After a sedate start, the mystery had me engaged and anxious to find out how the pieces all fit together. That momentum kept me turning the pages (when I should have been doing other things) until about 80ish% mark where, essentially the mystery had been solved. There was only to work out what life would look like going forward to reveal – and that part lost me. It veered from my expectations of where I thought the plot was going (or should have) and left me feeling dissatisfied. Readers who enjoy domestic fiction exploring themes like love and sacrifice, good and evil, faith, hope, inner strength may like this story. Hannah’s central concern was to protect Bailey. From what, was the question she had to figure out. Drawing on wisdom passed down from her grandfather, Hannah did her best to protect Bailey at all costs. Watching my grandfather work taught me that not everything was fluid. There were certain things that you hit from different angles, but you never gave up on. You did the work that was needed, wherever that work took you. "

The story made sense as it unfolded and didn't contradict itself. The characters made somewhat realistic decisions and the plot wasn't driven by stupidity.

147,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/128938274-sophie,Rating 2 out of 5," dnf @43%  Maybe this is just another case of me not being the right audience for this?Hannah's husband, Owen, suddenly disappears when his tech start-up is raided and investigated for fraud. Owen is the head coder and a lead suspect in the investigation, Hannah (and Owen's daughter, Bailey, who Owen has left with Hannah) try to get to the bottom of his disappearance together. This started out alright, a little slow, but not terrible. I kept turning the page, wanting to know what happened next. But then we got into... idiotic territory. My first issue is the stepchild rep, I just found Bailey so  mean  and  b98chy,  not all stepchildren are like this. Personally, I love my stepmom, and I would never be caught dead telling some random stranger on an airplane that ""I'm not hers."" Like, who says something like that?? There are stepchildren that exist out there that are nice and not total a8sholes, so I felt like this was an overgeneralization. I can't really explain it, but I also didn't like Hannah all that much either... I didn't even make it through the second half of this book and I already think she overlooked a lot of Owen's suspicious behavior in the beginning. Which, alright, maybe that's part of the story. But if you think about it logically... I mean, as I mentioned before, I didn't finish the book so I don't know how it ends, but if Owen's the head coder at his company, he had to know that the tech wasn't ready, ie, he was probably aware of the fraud going on. I also think the ""investigator"" aspect of this book from what I read was a little silly. For example, if they were trying to find people at a wedding Bailey went to when she was little and they were trying to find out who's it was... why didn't they just look through pictures? Bailey literally said they took billions of pictures at the wedding and in the beginning, there was basically a whole chapter devoted to how many pictures Owen had of Bailey throughout her childhood. Maybe that happened later but, I kind of thought a lot of this was... stupid and obvious?Like I said, maybe I'm not the right audience for this, it seems like it might be a little more geared towards older middle-aged ladies. Maybe it gets better, but I'm just in a place right now where I need to dive deep into a really good book. Happy reading <3"

“Most people don’t want to hear the thing that will make it work better… They want to hear what will make it easier.”

Browsing through the GR 2021 choice winner’s, I noticed that I have read all the winners in the genres that I do read except for this one. I do love the mystery/ thrillers genre and the cover game me those family dramas vibes so I knew I had to read it and read it I did.The story follows Hannah Hall whose life change overnight when her husband Owen disappear leaving her only with a note that says “protect her” referring to her step daughter. The story then ventures to show them teaming up trying to figure out what the hell is going on and who Owen really is.The story was easy to get into. The introduction is gripping and you immediately start thinking of all these questions you want answers to. What really was interesting for me here was the mystery element as I am used to reading these stories for the whodunit. But this story involves no murder crime and the mystery is a bit different. I think it is more of a mystery and not much of a thriller which deterred some readers from it.Hannah is a well written character. She’s obviously not perfect but she is not meant to be and she does take some bad decisions which I think is very realistic for someone in her place. And I really respected her for putting up with her step daughter Bailey who is a typical teenager -and we are reminded of that again and again- who thinks she is edgy but is really just annoying.

“He never understood that I wasn’t scared of someone leaving me, I was scared that the wrong person would stay.”

The story is told through first person point of view with 40 chapters and 320 pages so the chapters are kind of short which kept the pacing fast. That being said, the story stales a bit in the middle and become repetitive. The ending is not bad but to be honest it left me wanting more. I think it did not wrap everything as it should have done which makes me understand the readers who did not like it.Summary: I like the story and I think it is good overall. TBH, it is not one of those stories that will stick with me for a long time but it was intriguing enough to finish in a day and a half and it provided me with enjoyment. The elements of the story were well balanced but the ending leaves a bit more to be desired. "
150,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7115890-constantine,Rating 2 out of 5,"Rating: ⭐⭐Genre: Mystery Thriller????One of my reading goals for 2023 is to read a few books that received Goodreads awards in various categories. The Last Thing He Told Me has been on my radar for some time, as many of my friends loved it, and it also won the Goodreads award for best mystery thriller in 2021. ""The Last Thing He Told Me"" by Laura Dave is a novel that tells the story of a woman named Hannah, whose husband, Owen, suddenly goes missing. Hannah realizes that she didn't truly know Owen as well as she thought she did when she works to piece together what happened to him. Along the way, she gets closer to his teenage daughter, Bailey, and the two strike up an improbable connection. Soon enough, she uncovers some terrible secrets about Owen's history. The story delves into topics such as marriage, family, and the lies that individuals tell one another about themselves and others. In the end, Hannah will have to face the facts about her husband and come to terms with the person he actually is in order for her to be able to go on with her life.My initial thought was always, ""How is this book classified as a mystery thriller?"" I just couldn't wrap my head around it. This is more or less a piece of general fiction, but it does have some aspects of a mystery. This work doesn't have any of the tension and suspense that one would expect from a mystery novel. This should never have been categorized under ""mystery thriller"" in the first place because it is not one. The fact that it was voted the best thriller is something that has me scratching my head. The writing was decent, but the plot moved at an extremely snail's pace, thus the overall effect was more of a slow burn. Even if you consider it to be a work of general fiction, the narrative itself is not very intriguing and has moments that are hard to swallow since they are so far-fetched. The conclusion was not at all satisfying, which leads one to wonder what the point of the whole thing was in the first place. I'm confused as to the reason behind all of the hype. My expectations were just not met by this in any way.“Protect her” “Protect her” “Protect her”I was the one who needed to protect my nerves to avoid having a nervous breakdown!"
151,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12581658-noel-noelreads,Rating 1 out of 5,"I like reading popular books. Contemporary fiction and thrillers usually have interesting sounding plots, and are quick and easy books to read somewhat mindlessly, which I need while trying to work through fantasy series or other long, more brain intensive reads. But honestly I don’t often find them living up to the hype. And that means I’m going to be full of unpopular opinions. 😂🤷🏻‍♀️This book was just not good. Right away the writing drove me nuts. Lots of clunky descriptions that made no sense, and back to back sentences that said literally the same thing. I was finding these problems every couple of pages throughout the book. I can see how it could possibly be the dialect of the narrator, as it’s written in first person, but it was very poorly done if that was the intent.The plot was alright at first. It was interesting enough that I kept reading. But halfway through I was getting bored. Also, there were many instances where the decisions made seemed irrational, and everything was rather far-fetched, and the ending had no real impact on me. The only reason I kept reading after the halfway point was that the book wasn’t too long and it read really quickly.The one star rating feels kind of harsh, as I didn’t hate the book. But the poor writing, mediocre plot, and total forgetability means I can’t rate it any higher. "

Although the husband's newlywed wife and daughter don't agree on many things, they agree that the husband's disappearance is out of character and form a reluctant alliance to discover the truth about his disappearance and whereabouts.This low-key domestic suspense drama was well-written, fast-paced, and boasted strong character development. Unfortunately, the book fell apart as soon as clues about the husband's past began to surface. The last portion of the book was contrived and implausible ---and, quite frankly, left me rolling my eyes and very disappointed.I listened to the audiobook and the narrator was good but not great.

Instead of a step monster, Laura Dave presents us with a loving and loyal woman who'd do anything for the child she didn't raise. I like that she's fallible too. Overall, a very good read. "

157,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4103395-lisa-wolf,Rating 4 out of 5,"In Laura Dave’s unputdownable new novel, Hannah is happily married to Owen, and trying her best to get Owen’s 16-year-old daughter to accept her, or at the very least, to not actively dislike her. Owen and Hannah met and married and moved in together in his Sausalito floating home, all within the space of two years. But suddenly, their life is irreparably disrupted.Owen’s tech company’s CEO is arrested for fraud and stock manipulation. It’s a huge scandal, but making matters worse for Hannah and Bailey is that Owen disappears as the news breaks. He hasn’t been arrested, and he hasn’t been directly implicated or accused of wrong-doing. Instead, he simply vanishes, leaving Hannah a scrawled note telling her to protect Bailey.Hannah can’t believe that Owen is anything but a victim of circumstance, but his cryptic note confuses her. She’s even more disturbed when a Federal Marshal and then the FBI come knocking on her door, all looking for information on Owen’s whereabouts. With no way to reach Owen and no idea what he could be hiding, Hannah suggests to Bailey that they take matters into their own hands and go look for him instead.Based on some loose memories of Bailey’s from her early childhood, as well as hints from some of Owen’s stories of his college days, they’re soon on his trail — but Hannah is horrified to discover that none of the history Owen shared with her seems to be true. Not his real name, not his family background, not his education… and if all of this is fabricated, then who really is this man she fell in love with and married?Despite her own fears, Hannah realizes that she needs to honor Owen’s request to keep Bailey safe, even if Bailey seem to detest her and even if she doesn’t actually know what she’s protecting her from. But as they travel together to a new town and track down seemingly random facts and vague clues, they come to realize that they only have one another to rely on… and as they start putting the puzzle pieces together, Hannah becomes more and more certain that she may not like the answers she finds.The Last Thing He Told Me is an intricately plotted web of misdirection and secrets. Through flashbacks, we see Hannah and Owen’s courtship and marriage, and learn the stories he shared with Hannah about his past. In the present, we see Hannah being truly there for Bailey, and Bailey’s grudging realization that Hannah might be the only person in the world she can fully count on.There are deep, dark, dangerous secrets to be uncovered, and harsh truths for both Hannah and Bailey to confront. Ultimately, Hannah faces a decision that affects all of their lives, and only she has the ability to make sure that she’s choosing a path that carries out Owen’s wishes for Bailey.I did not see where the story was going, and I was completely hooked on trying to figure out Owen’s secrets and why he behaved the way he did. Needless to say, the resolution was not what I expected! Kudos to the author for keeping me guessing all the way through!In addition to the puzzle of the events of the story and the truth behind Owen’s disappearance, I really liked the developing trust and connection between Hannah and Bailey. I came to respect and admire Hannah very much — she’s put in an impossible situation, with no good options, and finds a way to do the right thing even when it feels like the worst choice in the world.I picked up this book before it was announced that this would be the Hello, Sunshine choice for May. I’m delighted to see it getting so much attention! The Last Thing He Told Me is a gripping, fascinating read that practically demands to be discussed, and I think it would make a great book group selection.Highly recommended!"
158,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/271661-colleen-chi-girl,Rating 5 out of 5,"❤️❤️ Love love love ❤️ ❤️From the very beginning, I was totally reeled in and engrossed in this thriller. The setting is Sausalito, a beautiful, small and artsy village just across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco. I’ve been there and loved the gallery shops, the bakeries, and cool vibe. And this is the town where amazing Robin Williams lived 😥 and where who wouldn’t want to live!? This fictional couple, of course, live there...right on the water. A piece of Paradise. We are introduced to a newly married couple, Hannah and Owen. This marriage results in a family of 3, as Hannah becomes the stepmom to Owen's brooding, teenage daughter. I know how hard it is being a stepmom and I can’t imagine starting off with an older teen, but Hannah is madly in love and jumps in head first. Now comes the suspense and thrills! Husband Owen disappears leaving behind a note that says, “Protect Her”. Hmmm.... Laura Dave's novel sucks you in. It’s so well written as she develops the characters and their relationships, along with the mystery about her new and missing 🤭husband, Owen. It's also about adjustments, relationships, untruths, uncovering, lies and deceit, changes and brightness. Depends on your outlook. I loved it for so many reasons. Mostly for the strong women who wouldn’t back down despite the odds and the craziness, and the mystery and thrills. Also, I loved their supportive network of good and honest people. Sometimes when a story is intense and painful, there's a silver lining somewhere to keep you on this journey.This was masterfully written by Laura Dave (Goodreads Author) and narrated by the talented, Rebecca Lowman."
159,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/96425974-margaux-b,Rating 2 out of 5,"Perhaps I read too many books to enjoy this one properly as it felt too familiar and too unbelieveable. I've read a few books about a new husband disappearing and leaving his wife to deal with a difficult stepchild and the aftermath. It just didn't grab me and I am definitely in the minority with this opinion.Hannah herself was interesting. I liked learning about her childhood, how woodworking spoke to her, how she marched to the beat of a different drum. I really liked how the author gave Hannah a difficult childhood, but didn't make her a victim. Present day life for Hannah was my problem. I didn't connect and there was no suspense for me while reading. The relationship between Hannah and her step-daughter didn't feel real. Too formulaic. It was as convincing as Owen's backstory of providing evidence against a Texas criminal organization, one that was so powerful that he couldn't trust law enforcement and yet Owen, deciding to go alone, was able to hide from them. Never mind that he presently worked for a high profile tech company in California that was revolutionizing the internet! Pretty sure that would have made him famous. Makes no sense.By the time Hannah figures out Owen's secret, and her step-daughter goes missing, the plan to speak with the head of the crime family to negotiate a truce was too much for me. Since this was picked by a book club, I slogged through. There might have been lots of skimming from that point on, but the ending?! That ending belonged in a fairytale and this was supposed to be a mystery.Plenty have enjoyed this book so it must be me :)"
160,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51227238-fifi,Rating 3 out of 5,"The Last Thing He Told Me was a definite page turner with a fast paced plot, offering up just enough suspense and information at the right times for really satisfying build ups of tension and resolution. It never drags, since you’re continually finding out new things and having other questions build up. Domestic thrillers generally revolve around dysfunctional families. But The Last Thing He Told Me is about a loving family whose ties are tested by unusual circumstances. It was also nice to see a positive portrayal of a step-mother. Stepmothers in books are often seen as cruel and bad, so it was nice to see a stepmother-stepdaughter relationship that was kind and supportive. Even though this is a plot driven novel, one of the main themes is family. Throughout the book you see how Hannah and Bailey's relationship changes and while I find it interesting to read I did have one problem. I find Hannah a bit too perfect and while perfect characters are easy to root for, it also means there’s no room for the character to grow. I think Bailey was written as a stereotypical 16-year-old girl, she was petulant and sullen, even before her father disappeared. It gave the book a Hallmark quality to it which made this part of the story fall flat for me. I didn’t love the ending but didn’t hate it either. I did find it a bit far-fetched. But overall The Last Thing He Told Me was fun with enough twists & turns to keep the reader interested and well worth the read. "

164,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16108535-olga-shvets,Rating 1 out of 5,"Why...why...why is this book rates so high? The plot is inconsistent and “miraculous” not in the good sense of this word. So many plot details are just unrealistic. If a tech start-up goes busted for fraud, the authorities will not just arrest the CEO and then take time to investigate who else is involved, giving enough time (days!) for potential suspects to escape in the process. Cases like this are prepared for months if not years making sure to arrest everybody involved at the same time so that the suspects do not have any chance to escape justice or prepare for the arrest.If a CEO is involved in a fraud, then the CTO is 99,9% in the know! This is just impossible that the main coder of the software is possibly innocent under these circumstances (by the way, we never find out if Avett knew about Owen’s background and blackmailed him). If my step-daughter suddenly remembers a stadium in Texas and some orange colors connected to the team, I don’t need to call a football fan in the middle of the night to ask him which team he thinks those colors belong to - I would just google it. If my husband is responsible for exposing a OxyContin distribution ring, I would not go negotiating to one of their former members and then trust his word that all will be well no matter what family connections are involved. Because I am such a good psychologist and a judge of character?!? Please! You married a fraud and never suspected a thing. If my husband puts me through any FBI-related mess, involves me in a highly life-endangering mafia experience, leaves me to be responsible for his teenage daughter (no matter how much I love her), I would most definitely freak out and be FURIOUS (and not composed and understanding) - he never cared enough to think how his decisions affect his spouse and family (that he supposedly loves so much). Even if I don’t know what to feel, I definitely would not stay in love with a person who betrayed my trust in such a profound way. All in all, I kept wrinkling my forehead with skepticism while reading this book. As Stanislavski said: “I don’t believe it!”. Not a single word of it."

He's paid the girl $20 to deliver it--supposedly his phone is broken. The note reads ""Protect her."" Huh? Owen must mean his teenaged daughter Bailey but protect her from what? Why didn't he find a way to call? She tries calling him and leaves several increasingly-frustrated messages on his cell phone. Later that evening while picking her step-daughter up from school, she hears a news report on NPR that Owen's tech firm, The Shop, has been raided by the SEC and FBI and they've taken the CEO into custody. Has Owen gone into hiding to avoid arrest? When Bailey gets into the car, she's carrying a duffle bag that her dad apparently left in her locker that contains thousands of dollars. What in the world is going on?Hannah and Bailey have a difficult relationship at best but find it necessary now to team up to try to find Owen. Hannah soon learns from an investigator that Owen is NOT who he says he is. What would drive him to lie about his past? Hannah and Bailey begin following up on some clues that Owen let slip in unguarded moments but where will this lead and will it put them in danger too? Very intriguing! Laura Dave has a good, easy-reading style that keeps the reader turning pages till the end. What Hannah knows about Owen is revealed in flashbacks to the early days of their relationship. Can we ever really know another person? We tend to trust those we love, but that trust can be utterly destroyed when a devastating secret is revealed. I liked and cared about both Hannah and Bailey and cheered them on to the satisfying ending. I received an arc of this new suspense novel from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. Many thanks for the opportunity. Laura Dave is quickly becoming a favorite suspense author of mine!"
166,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7793520-teresa,Rating 4 out of 5,"The Last Thing He Told MeBy Laura DaveThis book had an interesting start. Hannah gets a visit from a young student with a note from her husband, Owen. All it says is “protect her.” Hannah assumes it means her difficult, sixteen-year-old stepdaughter, Bailey, but doesn’t understand why her beloved husband of two years would send her this note. She sits up most of the night waiting for him, but he doesn’t come home. The next thing she knows she and Bailey are thrown into the middle of a maelstrom concerning Owen, the company he works for and a major fraud investigation. Owen has disappeared leaving her in charge of his daughter who despises her.What follows is learning that the husband she loves is not the man she thought he was. Fed up with the FBI and the US Marshals, she and Bailey embark on their own investigation leading them into danger and discoveries maybe better left buried.This story is very character driven and I was hooked from almost the start. In fact, I read this book in one sitting. I would classify this as a mystery/ suspense and the ending left me with a tear in my eye. I gave it four stars and look forward to reading more by this author."
167,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/134669448-sue,Rating 2 out of 5,2⭐️ This book brought on so little emotion for me that it doesn’t even deserve a 1 ⭐️ rating. It was bleh and average. The wife was insufferable and so was her step daughter. A match made in heaven. The step daughter was so rude and the step mom was her doormat. I understand that Hannah was trying to be empathetic and kind but the evil step daughter act was getting old. Hannah was so pretentious and her thoughts about people were so condescending. She acted like she was above it all. Her husband ran away and lied to her about everything. She had almost no real human reaction and skipped straight to being the understanding loving wife. It just felt too fake. During the entire book they alluded to this big ending. A big Ah-ha moment that never came.

172,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51274255-sophie,Rating 2 out of 5,"I received a free copy from the publisher in exchange for my honest review. ’The Last Thing He Told Me’ is the story of Hannah; a woman who's husband suddenly disappears, leaving her with a step-daughter and lots of unanswered questions. The mystery of Owen’s disappearance was enough to keep me turning pages for a while... but the search for answers started to wear thin for me around the mid-point.My main problem with this book was I felt it was about the wrong person. The lead, Hannah, was bland and she seemed to stumble unwittingly upon someone else's far more dramatic story, which she herself had no part in. She just hears about it. So we, as the readers, have to hear about it too... rather than SEE IT for ourselves.The characters that were central to Owen's disappearance were only introduced about two thirds into the book... where all of a sudden we're learning the story of Hannah's missing-husband’s-ex-wife’s-brother’s-girlfriend's-cousin-twice-removed (I’ve exaggerated - but only very slightly!) The degrees of separation between Hannah and these important characters was confusing at first, and ultimately made Hannah feel like a redundant part of the story, despite her being the lead character. I also felt like I needed extensive knowledge of Owen’s family-tree to really follow... and since Owen himself hadn’t even appeared in the present-day timeline of the book, it was difficult to care about this extended family all that much.I also wonder if the basis of the story was fundamentally flawed; if Owen was the brilliant Dad he was painted to be, then he simply WOULDN’T have left his daughter with a woman who had no clue what danger his daughter was in. Not to mention a woman that his daughter didn’t even like. Leaving Bailey with Hannah didn't provide her any kind of protection at all. It just didn’t make sense. Unfortunately this all made it hard for me to really get behind the story and characters. But I did think it was an interesting concept that kept me intrigued at least for the first half."

I found myself frequently wondering what I would do in the characters' shoes. Would I make the same choices? Just an all around good book and one that I'm still thinking about a week after I finished it. The less you know ahead of time, the better when it comes to this story. The bare minimum is husband and father Owen Michaels has gone missing. His wife and daughter are desperate for answers. Alright, that's enough! Enjoy the book!The story alternates between the present with everyone looking for Owen and key moments in the past that provide context to his disappearance. The mystery elements are strung along fairly well so you just have to sit back and watch everything unfold as it would be difficult to predict every single detail. The characters aren't people I particularly cared for but I still felt invested in their lives.Definitely recommend as there's a little something for every reader. You got some mystery, some thrilling elements, and plenty of stuff to analyze in regards to the plot and characters. "

Hannah and Bailey set out to find out who owen truly is. This was not a thriller, but a domestic suspense. You see the relationship between Hannah and Bailey develop through the story, and how they become closer realizing that they may have to live a life without Owen.

Bailey had been used to it being just her and her father after her mother. Tragically died when Bailey was a young child. Hannah’s frantic calls to Owen go unanswered.

“Maybe we are all fools, one way or another, when it comes to seeing the totality of the people who love us—the people we try to love.”
It took me a while to write this review, but here we are!In short: I love this book. It's gripping and I'll recommend it to anyone.For more details, keep reading.. 🩷
❥Short summary:
When Owen Michaels vanishes, he leaves behind a ominous note for Hannah, his wife of one year, saying: ""Protect her."" Despite the chaos and confusion, Hannah Hall knows right away that he's referring to his 16 year-old daughter, Bailey. Bailey lost her mother as a child and resents her new stepmother. The plot thickens when she returns home with a large sum of money, giving to her by her father. Next to that, Owen doesn't answer any of his calls, the FBI arrests Owen's boss, and federal agents appear at Hannah's doorstep. Not knowing who to trust, It's up to Hannah and Bailey to figure out what on earth is going, why this is happening and if Owen's really who he said he is..
❥My opinion:
This book grips you from the start. I���ve never read anything by Laura Dave before, but I definitely will again.She has the ability to bring the characters to life. Hannah and Owen had a very normal, ordinary relationship before it all went down, and still their moments felt special. I loved them together, even though that wasn’t the focus of the story.Bailey’s resentment towards Hannah and Hannah's efforts to build bridges anyway, followed by the development of their relationship when they had to rely on each other.. it was all really well done!The story was really nicely paced, while the mystery unravelled slowly. Giving you time to figure things out on your own without getting boring. 
❥ Quotes:

I was so involved with the characters and story that I finished the book in two sittings. It is a book that puts to the test just how far one is willing to go for those he/she loves. It tests the bonds between father and daughter and husband and wife. I couldn't believe the sacrifices made in the name of love. Hannah and Owen have only been married two years and things are tense as Hannah tries to squeeze into a family that, since the death of his first wife many years ago, has just been Owen and his now 16-year old daughter, Bailey. There's nothing like a broody 16-year old to make things difficult. Things go even more awry when Owen suddenly disappears leaving Hannah only a cryptic note to protect Bailey. Then news hits that Owen's boss has been arrested on fraud charges and further arrests of high ranking officers, possibly including Owen, are imminent. Is that why Owen left? So he wouldn't be arrested? Hannah thinks there's more to his disappearance than that and she and Bailey form an uneasy alliance to find out why Owen has vanished. With the FBI and US Marshall Service after Owen, Hannah and Bailey are racing to find him first. What they uncover is not at all what they expected. Owen has secrets far more threatening than anything related to his work. They find that they don't really know the Owen he professed to be.This is a powerful book about family dynamics and love that made me think in terms of my own family and what I would give up for them. I don't know if I could be as strong as Owen. True to its genre, the book has twists that while not totally unpredictable, are surprising. My only complaint was the sudden bonding between Bailey and Hannah. I just don't think it would happen that easily. This book is a solid 4.5 stars.Thank you NetGalley and Simon & Schuster for the opportunity to read this ARC in exchange for an honest review."
189,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14090427-misha-heartsfullofreads,Rating 4 out of 5,This book is not a fast-paced thriller. It is more of a slow burn.I was along for the ride with Hannah and Bailey trying to discover what happened to Owen. Was he in danger? Were they in danger? Was Owen who they thought he was?Bailey was very much every Stepmothers worst nightmare in the beginning. Hannah seemed a little too moon-eyed for someone who's Husband disappeared without a word. I was quickly invested in the mystery surrounding Owen's disappearance. The audiobook was a quick and easy listen.

One of the reasons I rarely read thrillers like this is that they so rarely can finish well. This one did not, went from a five star read to a three by the end. So disappointing as it had so much going for it, too bad it could not sustain or finish it."

192,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47771344-alyssa,Rating 1 out of 5,"For about 70 percent of this book, I more or less enjoyed it. I was intrigued about what Owen was hiding and I enjoyed Hannah’s relationship with Bailey.First there were little things that bothered me (Hannah being stumped by what college football team plays in Texas and wears orange.. so she decides to call her ex fiancé at midnight and ask rather than google... also I have nothing more than a cursory knowledge of college football and even I know the answer to that). Then Hannah started to become an extremely unreliable narrator, introduced to us as totally in the dark... but then they’d flash back and give REALLY suspicious hints about Owen that she knew the whole time.But the real nail in the coffin for me was making Nicholas out to be some Thanos style villain legitimately saying things like Hannah was making a “deal with the devil” painting him out to be some horrible monster for the cardinal sin of... being a defense attorney? Taking cheap shots at Public defenders for representing people accused of crimes is lazy, dated writing that shows a complete lack of understanding of the criminal justice system. And the author didn’t even try to cover it up with any real explanation of illegal behavior by Nicholas. (She never even really explains what he went to prison for? Vaguely indicating it was somehow connected to being a defense attorney). Instead she said things like “the prosecutor was lazy, and I got him off.” And then having Hannah snark at that with comments about how her morals wouldn’t allow her to defend people. Well guess what? The right to a defense is quite literally in the constitution. I don’t know what prosecutor/law enforcement were feeding the author information, but she got it grossly wrong. "

198,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/352711-leftbanker,Rating 2 out of 5,"Are You My Mother?This novel won the best thriller/mystery on Goodreads for 2021, a fact that dumbfounds me. If there were a separate category for crime novels, I’d never venture to read these winners in thriller/mystery because those just aren’t my idea of reading fun. And why isn’t there a crime category? They have categories for every other damn thing. I give this book three stars just so no one can accuse me of hate-reading. It’s just not my cup of tea, not even close.Yet another retread on the theme of women married to men who aren’t the people they appear to be. Maybe that should be a separate category in the Goodreads Choice Awards because this book is no thriller and not much of a mystery. Why is this such a popular theme with women readers? What was it about this novel that sparked such the enthusiasm to make it the winner in the mystery/thriller category?This was more of a family drama than anything. A stepmom trying to bond with her horrible little teenage stepdaughter. This is for people who watched The Sopranos just to watch the scenes in the psychiatrist’s office, and Tony’s fights with his wife or his two horrible offspring, bullshit I fast-forwarded through without fail. There was one scene that I thought represented this book. Several pages are spent with stepmom and stepdaughter trying to convince some flunky at a church to search records about a wedding. Very tedious. Unthrilling? Is that a word? Nonthrilling? The mystery aspect was mostly a big bore and you just know that her hubby is going to turn out to be a super guy and not the fraud we are shown in the beginning.So, I don’t like mysteries and I especially hate mysteries in which the protagonists walk around asking questions like the reader would know the answer, “Why would my father lie about who my mother is?” How the fuck would I know?""Protect her."" What the heck kind of note is that? If the husband has time to write a note, write a real note with clear instructions instead of two words he'd scream on his fall to the sidewalk after he'd been pushed out of a tenth story window. The book never had a clear explanation as to why the dad couldn't call, or why he left such a short, cryptic, stupid note. The wife has no idea what's happening and ""protect her"" could mean buying sunscreen for the lippy brat, or drive carefully when the the kid is onboard.If your idea of thrilling is reading about some snooty women checking into a hotel, and then walking down the street, this book is for you. There is nothing the snotty teenager has that a good slap in the chops wouldn’t cure. Every time a kid says “whatever” to an adult, they need a good slap, because ""whatever"" a synonym for ""fuck you"" and no kid should get away with letting that one fly without a good crack. Simple parenting rules for everyone and anyone.Most of the novel is spent with the protagonist running around like a chicken with her head cut off trying to find out who her husband really is, and then the entire story is dumped in our lap in a couple of paragraphs. I thought the set-up was exceptionally slow and the payoff just wasn’t worth the wait.P.S. I came across this book today, only six months after I read it, and nothing about it seemed to be familiar. Completely forgettable on every level. I challenge anyone who enjoyed this novel to describe a single scene in the story a month after they finish reading it."
199,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6970586-denise,Rating 4 out of 5,"For some reason, this one didn't initially grab me - maybe it was the Ponzi scheme storyline or the somewhat slow start, but about the halfway mark, it really took off, and I ended up thoroughly enjoying it! The back cover blurb doesn't do the plot justice: Owen Michaels disappears, but before he does, he leaves a note to his new wife, Hannah, which says only, ""Protect her."" Despite her confusion, Hannah knows exactly to whom the note refers: Owen’s sixteen-year-old daughter, Bailey. Bailey, whose mother died as a child, and who wants absolutely nothing to do with her new stepmother, Hannah. Within hours of receiving the note, the FBI arrests Owen’s boss, and a US Marshal and FBI agents arrive at their home asking questions about Owen and what she knows. Hannah does not know who to trust or what is happening, but she quickly realizes her husband is not who he said he was, and that Bailey holds the key to figuring it all out. The two form a reluctant alliance and together set out to discover the truth. From that description, it sounds rather underwhelming, but as Hannah and Bailey start putting together the pieces of Owen’s past, nothing (and I mean nothing) is as it seems, and the truth is way more complicated than either of them could have imagined. The story begins in Sausalito, California and moves to Austin, Texas, and the chapters set in Austin kept me continually saying, ""wait, what?!"" I thought the execution was brilliant, and for most of the book, I had no clue how things would ultimately play out or who were the ""bad guys"" and who were the ""good guys."" I liked both Hannah and Bailey's characters (even if at times, I found four-year-old Bailey's stellar memory a bit implausible). The plot's strength is really their relationship and their growing bond, as Bailey slowly begins to understand and accept Hannah's desire to protect and love her as a daughter.The underwhelming start keeps this from being a 5-star read for me, but overall, I did find myself very invested in the story and the characters. Just be prepared that this is not a thriller, per se, but more of a domestic suspense. This was my first Laura Dave book, but I would definitely be open to reading more of her work. 4 stars."

Perhaps, considering this, my expectations were just too high.Hannah is happily married to Owen when he suddenly disappears just as the software company he works for is exposed by the FBI for fraud. Owen’s only contact with Hannah before fleeing is a note simply saying, ‘protect her’. Hannah knows Owen is talking about his 16 year old daughter, Bailey, whose mother had been killed in a car crash when she was very young. Despite Bailey and Hannah’s relationship being rocky, they both agree that Owen would not be guilty of anything the FBI are implying so they team up to further investigate themselves.It all sounds better on paper. The revelations which Hannah and Bailey discover are not particularly original or unique. Their methods of investigating were nothing special either. In fact, a lot of it involved Hannah and/or Bailey conveniently remembering something from the past. Hannah is an okay character but I’m afraid Bailey just acted like a spoilt brat. I know how teenagers act, I have two spoilt ones of my own, but I’m afraid Hannah comes across as a saint for putting up with Bailey.One positive was that I did enjoy the place settings: Austin and its friendly university city vibes, and Sausalito and its cute floating homes. Overall the book is readable but it’s nothing special. Whilst reading I kept waiting for something (a twist?) that was going to elevate the book and help me understand its popularity. But it never came. 3 out of 5"
202,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2745288-wendy-darling,Rating 2 out of 5,"The thing is, when your thriller isn’t really a thriller and the mystery involves straightforward, bare minimum research and resolution, you really need excellent writing and characterization—and neither is particularly remarkable here. There’s not a moment of high tension or anguish or fear or passion, and the plotting is pretty Point A to Point B. I am also just not that interested in stories that involve organized crime, even though it’s not a huge part of this story, despite being the main reason the book exists.This attempts to be something more than a thriller, I guess, by trying to present parental sacrifices as well as endless, picture-perfect patience from the main character Hannah, who is both abandoned, manipulated wife and new stepmom. (Seriously, you’re not mad he left you with this mess with nothing more than two (stupid)words? Not even once?) There’s not much complexity in this character or her relationship with her stepdaughter, however, and there’s a faint but distinct whiff of martyrdom hanging over her every action that makes her hard to swallow."

But I'm rounding up rather than down because it held my interest. It kept me reading right on through, so that I essentially finished it in one sitting, with a few little breaks. And what more can one ask of a book on a hot day when you just want to curl up in a cool room and enjoy the blessing of air conditioning? Hannah and her step-daughter Bailey have a bit of an adversarial relationship, because...teenage girl. But then they team up to do a little far-fetched super-sleuthing to figure out what happened to Bailey's father Owen, who has disappeared, leaving behind cryptic notes and wads of moolah. They get a little more than they bargained for, because Owen is not who they thought he was. Dun dun dun!It made me want to go to Sausalito, but not to Austin. "

The writing....oh boy. She does go off on a lot of tangents and she does provide a lot of detail when detail is not needed and when detail is needed she keeps it from us. I didn't relate to any of the characters I couldn't find any of the characters interesting in any way and didn't care about any of them. I kept hoping for more but more never showed up.

Because it was anything but that. A family drama perhaps? I’m not really sure…All I know is that once again, I was sucked into the hype that goes into a Reese Witherspoon book club pick. I will say that this book did start off strong, but then it just flatlined about halfway through. I was not impressed with the ending either.

(2021). Before Owen disappears, he manages to smuggle a note to his new wife Hannah: 'protect her'. It obviously refers to his 16-year-old daughter Bailey, whose mother died years ago. And who wants absolutely nothing to do with her new stepmother. As her calls to Owen go unanswered, his boss is arrested for fraud and the police start questioning her. Hannah realises her husband isn't who he said he was. And Bailey may hold the key to discovering Owen's true identity and why he disappeared. Together they set out to discover the truth which is complex... It's easy to see why this novel is part of the popular 'Reese's Book Club' and is also going to become a TV series. This is a gripping and engaging story which will translate to the screen well. Hannah is an extremely likeable character who clearly loves her new husband, as well her new stepdaughter Bailey who doesn't exactly feel the same way. When Owen disappears, Hannah knows she needs to protect Bailey as per Owen's wishes but she also wants to find out what has happened. Hannah and Bailey need to work together to find the answers to their questions, but this will prove a journey full of unexpected twists and danger...Overall: highly recommend this twist-filled page-turner to any reader that enjoys a great mystery thriller."
213,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette,Rating 2 out of 5,Not for me. Implausible from nearly every angle. Hated some of the takes upon long winded repetitive voids dotted with impossible associative name dropping. (Someone is going to Un. of Chicago or some other big name prestige place at drop of the hat will- as if you just saunter in to those. Reminded me of the book where she got into Oxford overnight by phone.)But the impossible juxtapositions was not my main peeve. It was just plain boring and so far-fetched in moods and work methods on top of it. I never once became embedded. Always waiting for the kick that never came.No more of hers for me. That ending!!

Według mnie autorka postawiła przede wszystkim na relację między macochą a pasierbicą (a zakończenie książki tylko to potwierdza) i to właśnie głównie jej rozwój śledzimy przez całą fabułę. Thriller rozgrywa się gdzieś w tle, nie czułam, żeby był najważniejszy i chyba spodziewałam się czegoś odrobinę innego. Nadal jednak jest to bardzo dobrze, choć jednocześnie lekko i niewymagająco napisana powieść i można ją pochłonąć w ciągu kilku godzin. "

It is a completely normal day until her husband never returns home. The last thing he says to her is a note he left saying “protect her”.Hannah is left to pick up the pieces and embark on a journey for answers as to who her husband really is, for the sake of his daughter. I enjoyed the character development, seeing Hannah take on the role of parent and a relationship of trust being slowly built between herself and Bailey. I enjoyed the sense of chasing for answers as they travel to another state to uncover the truth of the past. I did find the ending a little jumbled when everything came together. The explanation didn’t fully make sense to me and I found i still had a lot of questions left over. I wasn’t a fan of the epilogue or the conclusion as it wasn’t exactly the happy end I was hoping for. I’m interested to watch the tv series adaption to see if that clears up anything I may have missed or gives me the closure I was hoping for!

He went so far as to change his and his daughter’s names and identities to keep them safe after he ratted on his criminal father-in-law (his daughter’s grandfather), resulting in his father-in-law’s conviction and jail time. The grandad is a nasty dude and works for nasty dudes who will hunt Owen and his daughter down (and kill them) if they ever find them. So Owen has spent the last years of his life hiding his daughter from this grandad and his cronies. But Owen’s new identity may be exposed due to a scandal at his workplace, so he flees town. Then his new wife of one year, who his daughter can’t stand, uncovers all this information. She then decides that the best thing for this daughter is to never see her father again and to strike up a new relationship with this granddad who wants her father dead… mostly so she can keep woodworking and the daughter can keep her (false) name and identity. And these were the same people Owen wanted to keep his daughter away from the most? So grandad will shoot her beloved father dead in the street if he ever sees him, but he and granddaughter will probably spend some lovely Christmases together? I just couldn’t get this plot to make much sense to me. And the characters were quite boring. Hannah was as emotive as a garden statue. Bayley had nothing but a bad attitude. But good thing Bayley remembered an insane amount of details from a wedding in Austin when she was four when the day before that she had no memory of ever even going to Austin. Oh and Owen changed his whole identity and backstory, including where he went to college, but constantly referenced the first and last name of his renowned favorite professor who taught his entire career at an entirely different university. This is a guy who changed the name and identity and even photos of his daughter’s mother, but couldn’t change the name of a professor to one who actually taught at his faux alma mater. This led the two Nancy Drews to crack the case wide open. Also because one time the wife mentioned taking a trip to Austin and he was like nah so she was like wow you have a whole secret past there."

It is repetitive to the point of melodrama (see: ""I don't answer him, because he wants me to say yes—yes, I'll let him protect me. Yes, I'll let him protect us. And I'm not going to say that. I'm not going to say it because I know this much is true: he can't."" and ""I watch her face as she tries to process that—this terrible, impossible thing. The terrible, impossible thing he never wanted to say to her. The terrible, impossible thing I've been suspecting myself. The terrible, impossible thing I've known.”) It's also relatively slow and plodding for a thriller, without any real twist to speak of and an underwhelming conclusion.The only redeeming quality of this book in my mind is the development of the relationship between our protagonist, Hannah, and her step-daughter Bailey. But sadly, their relationship was not strong enough to save this book.Trigger/Content Warnings: Abandonment, Death of parent, Car accident, MurderYou can hear my thoughts on this book (and which books I think should have won the 2021 Goodreads Choice Awards in the Thriller & Mystery category instead) here: https://youtu.be/YQB3IfDYANsYou can find me on...Youtube | Instagram | Twitter| TikTokYou can join our book club over on Patreon...PBB Book Club"

The question is, who exactly is he and what secrets does he hold that have made him disappear off the face of the Earth?Hannah and Bailey reluctantly set out together to try and find out about Owens past, when Bailey was a little girl, too young to remember hers and Owens past life.

Fast paced, tight editing and story telling, it tells its story without over complicating the story(which could have easily happened given the story arc). The characters are well written and our central character Hannah is extremely likeable. A kind but strong and practical woman who will do whatever it takes to protect Bailey. A kind of thriller, a kind of buddy road book, this one zips along as I said and is an excellent read. Loved the ending too, which may not be everyone’s cup of tea. An author that wasn’t on my radar before but certainly is now. Many thanks to Netgalley and Serpents Tail/Viper/Profile Books for an ARC in exchange for an honest review. "

It will be one of my favorite reads this year and next year since it doesn't even come out until 2021. Laura Dave has written her best book yet. I am still reeling from this book and an ending I never saw coming!Owen disappears but leaves his wife, Hannah a note saying Protect Her. Bailey, Owen's daughter comes home with cash. Neither of them know where Owen could have gone. Soon the FBI arrests Owen's boss and they are knocking on Hannah's door. This is when Hannah realizes Owen isn't who he says he is. Hannah and Bailey set out to discover just who Owen really is. What they discover neither of them could imagine. I loved how this book was told in the present and in flashbacks. The relationship Hannah had with her grandfather left a lasting impression on me as someone whose grandfather raised her too. Laura Dave did an incredible job building this relationship and weaving it throughout the book. This book was definitely suspenseful throughout and kept me guessing the entire time. I will be putting this book in everyone's hands next year!Add this to your TBR for May 2021.Thanks to the publisher Simon & Schuster and Netgalley for my advanced ebook copy. "

The CEO of The Shop where Owen worked as a programmer has been taken into custody for fraud. Is Owen also guilty of wrongdoing? The only message Owen gets to Hannah is “Protect Her”—his beloved 16-year-old daughter Bailey. Bailey has been slow to accept her new stepmother so it is a bit awkward as the two of them seek answers as to where Owen could have gone. Their journey to trust each other is the main thrust of the story.While there is a suspenseful aspect to the plot, this is really a story about families and what they do to keep each other safe. Enjoy!"

Usually suspenseful stories like this are a fun read for me but I don’t get much emotional depth out of them, but this one was so different. A rich family story coupled with the tension of the “where is he?” storyline. I loved Hannah and Bailey, love the not-quite-mother-daughter dynamic. Read it in two days. Highly recommend."

227,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56292501-eda,Rating 4 out of 5,3.5 ⭐ Sürükleyiciydi ama thriller kazananı olacak bir kitap değildi bence. Beklentim yüksekti o yüzden sonu biraz hayal kırıklığı oldu.
228,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9693936-heidi,Rating 4 out of 5,"The theme ""how well do you REALLY know your spouse"" never gets old for me in a mystery. There are so many endless possibilities: your partner is a serial killer, a spy, an undercover agent, an alien life form from another planet, a person in witness protection, an undercover agent, a robot, a polygamist who has another three wives in different states. The skill lies a) in hooking the reader and getting them emotionally invested; and b) in the gradual unveiling of the mystery, like the unwrapping of a pass-the-parcel where the final product is something the reader has coveted all along. It's been done so many times before that it's not easy to come up with a premise a diehard thriller fan won't work out in the first few chapters. And whilst THE LAST THING HE TOLD ME didn’t reinvent the wheel, the gradual offering up of clues was intriguing and kept me eagerly reading on!It's exactly in this very predicament Hannah finds herself in when her husband Owen fails to come home one night, leaving her only with a short cryptic note delivered to her door: “Protect her.” “Her” meaning his beloved teenage daughter Bailey. Hannah knows that he would never willingly leave Bailey unless something was terribly wrong. The more she looks into Owen's past in the hope of finding him, the more Hannah realises that she doesn't know her husband at all. Was everything he has told her about himself a lie?Laura Dave knows all the tricks of hooking her readers and taking them along for the ride. I loved the sense of danger and suspense as Hannah's life unravelled and the gradual unveiling of clues that had me questioning everything. As Hannah's search for the truth put her own life in danger, the atmosphere became more claustrophobic and I constantly questioned what I would do if I was in her situation, even if I thought that Hannah remained surprisingly calm considering the circumstances. Which was probably my only little quibble with the story and the one thing that stood in my way of bonding emotionally with Hannah - maybe I'm just more emotionally unstable? I think I would have believed her predicament a bit better if she'd shown more vulnerability in an impossibly difficult situation. I also wasn’t totally convinced with Owen’s motives and thinking processes, but without his POV of the mess he got himself in it was tough to judge!That said, THE LAST THING HE TOLD ME held plenty of surprises in store and entertained from beginning to end. It will appeal to readers who enjoy a slower, character driven mystery with a slow unravelling of clues rather than an action packed, suspenseful read. It relies on the unspoken secrets in a marriage that can turn our lives upside down in an instant, and the relationship dynamics in step families. I enjoyed it and look forward to reading more from this author in future.3.5 starsThank you to Netgalley and Serpent's Tail for the free electronic copy of this novel and for giving me the opportunity to provide an honest review. *blog*  *facebook*  *instagram* "

This story took a completely different direction.I really like the fast pace in my novels, and here I felt that every scene had a purpose. Every scene and every conversation was here for some reason. They brought us closer to discovering the mystery, they added another element to this puzzle. This is a well-edited book.I also liked the main character Hannah. Despite the very unusual situation she finds herself in, she does not lose her head and tries to do her best to deal with the situation and protect her stepdaughter, just as her husband Owen asked her to do. Hannah is quick to think and not afraid to act. She is a strong heroine who can think outside the box and act on the spot.The difficult relationship between Hannah and her stepdaughter Bailey added extra drama and another interesting dimension to the story. We not only wonder what is going on with Owen, but also whether the relationship between Hannah and Bailey would eventually improve. And whether it will happen fast enough that none of them will get hurt.The ending surprised me. I didn't think this story would end like this. I even wonder if I'm a bit disappointed, but that's because I just like happy endings, and this one doesn't quite feel like one to me. Either way, the ending is interesting.I really enjoyed discovering Owen's secrets gradually. And while I think some of Hannah's actions weren't entirely rational (like going to Austin, for example) and there are some holes in the story, I had no problem overlooking them and enjoying the story."

Date: May 4, 2021Martie's Rating 3 1/2 StarsMini-ReviewThe premise of the story is about a loving husband and father who goes missing. His wife and daughter set out to track him down. The story jumps back and forth in time, chronicling the wife's early days with her spouse as well as her current search for him. Her life now revolves around the FBI, US Marshalls, and her husband’s dangerous family that she never knew he had. The tale is rather farfetched. But, the changing nature of the relationship between the both stunned wife and stepdaughter is what drives the story. At least, that is what caught this reviewer’s interest.

The romance wasn’t very believable. The relationship forged with the stepdaughter didn’t seem authentic and the resolution seemed ridiculous at best. Not to mention the plot, itself. A million dollars left and given back then no more mention of it? The husband’s dead first wife and manner of her death? You’re trying to tell me that the husband had no idea it could’ve resulted from something else she was involved in?I’ve wasted too much time on this as it is. Don’t fall for it.

I loved that this story felt like it was more about Hannah and Bailey’s growing bond and less of Owen/Ethan’s disappearance. I wonder if that was Dave’s purpose. The whole time I was reading, I was like “they better find Owen/Ethan at the end because I’m getting bored,” but I liked how he appeared in the end. His appearance at the end wasn’t dramatic, but it was still really portrayed and written beautifully and made me feel a little emotional. I loved it! The more I read I was like “Damn, Owen really hid a lot of shit didn’t he?” It started to get more dangerous and exciting, but it quickly became a little boring again. Grady’s character was also starting to feel really sus. I guess he wasn’t really a bad character, but it would have definitely been exciting if he wasn’t who he said he was. Hannah gets stronger and stronger throughout the strory, and at the end, I love how much of a badass she becomes. Overall I liked the story, but it didn't get me as excited as I want to be when I read a book, but Bailey and Hannah’s growing bond was what did it for me. *3.5 stars."

While I would have never guessed the reason Owen left a bag of cash, his daughter, and wife behind it still wasn't this huge OMG-worthy moment to me. Plus, the way it was revealed to readers as Hannah was still trying to piece everything together was a little bit of let down since I thought the author was doing a fantastic job of building up Owen's past. It just felt very anticlimactic to reveal it so quickly.With that being said though I still did absolutely fly through this and when I wasn't reading it I was trying to think up scenarios of why Owen would do what he did. I also really enjoyed the relationship between Hannah and Bailey and how much we see it grow over the span of such a short book. Hands down that was definitely my favorite part of this story."

Even at double speed it sinks in so incredibly smoothly. You don’t need to strain your brain at all. It was fine. I personally prefer mysteries with difficult personalities, moral uncertainty or, at the least, with something torrid and disgusting happening, but alas, the only thing that got me emotional was the annoying teenager who got my blood boiling a couple of times by being petulant and stupid. Otherwise, this was a wholesome kind of mystery with upstanding main character and barely threatening antagonists.

The houseboats just aren’t what I think of when I think of a good mystery and it turned me away every time. The cover *feels* boring for what is considered a “thriller.” The story is intriguing - protagonist Hannah does a lot of things I wouldn’t have done (lol! - but isn’t this why we read???) but her adventure in to the scary crime underbelly was interesting. The book wasn’t overly exciting or much of a “thriller” so how it won the 2021 GoodReads Choice award in the thriller category is beyond me… it’s more of a mystery.

250,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10651001-jaclyn,Rating 3 out of 5,"The Last Thing He Told Me is essentially a domestic drama. This novel won the 2021 mystery thriller category of the Goodreads choice awards. Now that I've read it, I can see why so many people voted for it.... but I'm not convinced it really is the best of the best from that category. There were some pretty great reads among those nominees, and this novel is very middle of the road. (My personal vote that year was for Ashley Audrain's debut The Push)The Last Thing He Told Me appeals to a wide readership: It's a mystery that isn't gory, that focuses on a family, specifically the relationship between a step-mother and step daughter. This is a low investment page turner driven by emotion and not by simple shock factor. There is no risk of death (for the most part), and the novel deals primarily in lies and deceit. It's a gossips dream.Overall it was a fun time, and I did enjoy the examination of the step mother/daughter relationship, but unfortunately the actions of the characters as well as the writing style (lots of telling, not showing), and instances where characters just divine clues out of thin air have me giving this three stars. Definitely engrossing, but inconsistent. The last half is somewhat unbelievable. The resolution? grossly unsatisfactory.A novel to read with popcorn and suspended belief."

Hannah Hall believes she has finally found her soulmate in husband of one year Owen Michaels and they live a seemingly happy life. Hannah is a craftswoman who makes handmade furniture for elite clientele. Together they live on a beautiful houseboat in Sausalito in Marin County, California alongside Owen's 16-year-old daughter Bailey, who is far from overjoyed with her father's new wife/ her stepmother. A computer coder for a prominent and successful technology start-up known as The Shop, Owen vanishes just before the company's CEO is arrested and taken into custody by the FBI after a year-long investigation into suspected fraud and corruption. They had apparently put some new software on the market way before it was fully functional and then cooked the books when it came to their finances. Both Hannah and Bailey are in total shock but before he skedaddled he left a note written to his wife with the words ""protect her"", delivered to them by a neighbourhood teen. She knows it refers to Bailey as she lost her mother tragically when she was young. The message is a simple one but Hannah knows she must find out what Bailey needs protection from and her motherly instincts kick into high gear. So amidst the fear, confusion and worry they know they must stick together. Bailey soon discovers that her father has left her over half a million dollars in cash bundled into a bag and placed into her locker at school.She tries everything to contact him but to no avail and refuses to believe her husband, the man she thought she knew inside and out, was involved in serious criminal activity so when a US marshal and federal agents arrive at her Sausalito home unannounced Hannah realises what she believes about Owen is in direct opposition to what the world is trying to tell her. Convinced of his innocence Hannah and Bailey work tirelessly to uncover what it was that made Owen run, where he is and if he's ever coming back. Their search leads them to Texas even though Owen had claimed when they had first met he was from the East Coast. As they decipher the clues and go deeper down the rabbit hole, they both realise that there is no Owen Michaels, he was merely a character played by a man with another name. Devastated Hannah and Bailey discover that the one good thing to come from this hideous betrayal is the close bond they now have with one another. This is a compulsive and enthralling thriller with a real mystery at its centre and not only does the author place many blindsiding plot twists and dizzying red herrings within the pages but her characters, namely Hannah and Bailey, are emotional and compelling too. It's a blisteringly paced, evocative domestic drama and you can't help but feel heartbroken for those left behind. Alternating between past and present, with suspense and tension in abundance and a poignancy about it, The Last Thing He Told Me asks the question: What happens when we trust the people in our lives despite all evidence to the contrary?"
252,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/285610-anne-ok,Rating 4 out of 5,"Straight up -- I didn't agree with the pre-publishing hype that promoted this book as a “thriller.” In my opinion, it falls more into the category of a domestic mystery/suspense. It was less thrilling than I anticipated with a slow-moving pace, but still an entertaining afternoon of reading from a new-to-me-author. I’m hearing bits and pieces of hoopla about an AppleTV series based upon Dave’s book and starring Julia Roberts as Hannah.
PROTECT HER.
A husband suddenly vanishes – leaving behind a note asking his wife of only one year to take care of his sixteen-year-old daughter. The police, FBI and a “friendly” US Marshal are all involved. Hannah just wants to find her husband and get some answers. Along with Bailey, her step-daughter, with whom she shares a strained relationship, the two begin a cross-country journey on their own to find the truth and hopefully the missing person. Their search is suspenseful and a bit calamitous while exploring the growing bond between this unlikely pair. I’m hesitant to say more – I don’t want to give anything away. For me, the ending was the major disappointment with too many remaining questions running wildly through my thoughts (a one-star reduction). I detest these types of endings – but a worthwhile read if you can deal with the lackluster ending!I certainly don’t want to give the impression that this was a bad read for me because it wasn’t. I just think it had much more potential than was tapped. What I did find very appealing was the author’s writing that flowed effortlessly and was easy to read and absorb, the build-up moving the story forward was exciting and overall, the plot kept me involved. In a strongly character-driven storyline, these characters were remarkably intriguing and solidly developed. No grouchy remarks in this regard.And it appears that hope might spring eternal with an added bit of info from the author, who told Popsugar, ""As for the future of the book? I know exactly where I would pick up with Hannah, Owen, and Bailey—and I love the idea of imagining their next chapter."" I certainly could get onboard with that thought. I would love to see a follow-up continuing this story to a complete resolution. "

255,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/153040237-emma-books,Rating 5 out of 5,"literally read this book in one sitting. it was such a good mystery novel that wrecked your heart but also put it back together and warmed it at the same time. the underlying motive for everyone was family. whether that meant protecting your family, creating new family, or rekindling old ties with family. these were the motives of all the characters in this book. it was beautiful, but at the same time you’re watching the struggle and loss of the wife and daughter who are left wondering where there father/husband went and who he really is? when i first started to read this book i tried to figure out what the plot twist would be and it still shocked me when it happened. when the story started to come together it truly was a revelation. I also do love an ending that’s not completely just a happy ending. it hurt you and made you feel a certain loss but the last line will warm your heart (i also just have mommy/daddy issues so it hurt real good).

256,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/82312876-silvia-c,Rating 3 out of 5,"An easy and light summer read. With low-key suspense and mystery.I enjoyed it well enough. I'm very surprised by all the high praises though, as everything in this book is just average. By no means a bad book, but the thing I liked best about it was the step-mother - step-daughter relationship, which is actually a big plus, since we don't see this kind of relationship often. I'd mostly recommend it for the portrayal of this relationship. I'd say this book is about family, lack of communication and choices and their consequences, rather than a thriller."
257,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3846535-christina-mcdonald,Rating 5 out of 5,"*This* is my kind of book! Smart, textured, wholly absorbing and absolutely heart wrenching, the story grabbed my attention and didn’t let go until I turned that last page.Beautifully written, richly evocative, with characters that are flawed yet relatable, Laura Dave writes in graceful prose. At the heart of the story is about the love a father has for his child and a stepmother who is willing to go to any lengths to keep her safe. Written with such heart and emotion I had tears in my eyes by the end, the book ultimately asks how well do you really know the people you love?"
258,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2592286-kerry,Rating 3 out of 5,What I think of as a: Who is he type mystery. Happy father/daughter pair then father decides to marry again and after one year all goes wrong. Father/husband disappears and new step-mother and daughter must try to put the clues together and figure out who he is and why he had to disappear. It is the type of mystery I like and this was well done. Easy read and quickly done with audio and print. If you are looking for a good family drama with a large mystery element I would recommend it.

267,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/810550-bill,No Rating,"DNF at 18%I can't do stupid. I'm sorry if this offends anyone who enjoyed this; I know this demands a certain reader mindset: willing to overlook illogical happenings and just breeze along with a story. That's just fine, and I thought that was where my mind was at when I loaded the thing onto my Kindle.But I can't do it. From the onset, the idea of a guy taking off and leaving a cryptic ""Protect her"" message to his wife is STUPID. The only reason for this is as a mystery device rather than present any sort of human logic whatsoever. And this phrase ""Protect her"" has already popped up ""dramatically"" about 12 times. I foresee another several dozen occurrences before the three hundred pages are up.I hit my limit of what I can take when our heroine shows up at a lawyer friend's home and there is no answer when she knocks or rings the bell. Nothing. Hmm. Seems no one is home. Peek in the window and there he is. So he comes to the door and as the conversation begins she happens to notice a dozen parents, two-year old children, and a clown having a birthday party. Yeah, it sure seems no one is home...a dozen toddlers are typically silent during a party with a clown, aren't they? (I challenge the existence of any door or window that could smother that racket.) You'd expect about a dozen cars parked outside too, no?I admit, I'm making a big deal out of a very minor detail with little relevance to the story, but I can't put a whole lot of trust into an author who can defy logic in one simple scene like this.I'm on a one-way ticket to a hate-read now and I'm not into that, so I'm out.It's not for me, and I'm an outlier, obviously. Go ahead and love this, I won't think any less of you."
268,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64423883-jill-lov,Rating 2 out of 5,"This book just fell flat for me. Of course, the premise was intriguing - a woman’s husband disappears one day, leaving behind some puzzling last words and she has to piece together the truth of the man she married but doesn’t really know. I just wasn’t convinced of the relationship between Hannah and Owen, or Hannah and Bailey. I actually thought that Hannah came off as arrogant and a bit pompous and it’s hard to get into a book if you dislike the main character. Spoilers below:Throughout the book there just wasn’t enough of Hannah herself as a person to get a clear look into her character. So for her to take the huge step of agreeing to cut Owen out of her life just for Bailey’s sake, essentially becoming Bailey’s “mom,” seemed unbelievable to me. The reveal of Owen’s true backstory and the reason he left Texas felt just thrown in there and killed the momentum of the book. It seemed ridiculous to me that if you were trying to stay in hiding from dangerous people, you would take such a prominent job and take part in something illegal and shady — WHICH IS WHY YOU HAD TO RUN AWAY IN THE FIRST PLACE. Did Owen not learn anything??? That was so frustrating. The story kept alluding to his father-in-law’s “people he works for” - why not just come out with more detail? Hannah‘s entire time at his estate and conversation with him in his office didn’t build up any feeling of dread or anxiety for me at all. After that, everything felt predictable. Of course Bailey was going to accept her as her mother. Of course Owen would try to get in touch discreetly. Once I saw the title for the last chapter, I thought, that’s it? A disappointing read."

The recently wed couple live on a floating home in Sausalito. After a tough childhood, Hannah is deeply in love. Her only big challenge is developing a close relationship with Owen’s teenage daughter Bailey, who has yet to warm up to her new stepmother. Their lives turn upside down when a note from Owen is delivered to her door. “Protect her” is all it says. Owen is gone. His company is under investigation for fraud. The CEO of his company has been arrested. When both a U.S. Marshall and then the FBI show up at her home, Hannah shockingly learns that Owen is not who he says he is. She decides that to truly protect Bailey, she needs to uncover the secrets that have been kept from her.The Last Thing He Told Me is an intriguing story told in the past and present. While this is a mystery and has some suspense, the core of the story is the bond that starts to form between Hannah and Bailey. The premise is very strong and the book was heading towards a 5-star rating before the mystery started to be solved. I enjoyed the book but it ended up falling just a little short. I will certainly watch the Apple TV+ adaptation which is in the works, to star Julia Roberts as Hannah."

I could not quit reading it. It was to me a perfectly written book. It had a great flow and the characters were wonderful. I enjoyed every minute of reading this book and think it might classify as a psychological thriller. This woman was determined to help this young girl who was not even her child but was child of her husband and his deceased wife. He left town in a hurry and only left her a note. She was determined to find out what happened to him and to also take care of his daughter. The book even had a somewhat happy ending, happy witht he facts that we learned as she went on her journey to find out why her husband disappeared. My mystery book club is reading this book for April and I definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys this type of story."

There seems to be complaints about things that either doesn’t matter plotwise or the writing which in my eyes was if not excellent then absolutely very good. One reviewer didn’t like the chapters being given titles, to me that was an original idea which heightened my interest. It is no wonder to me that this has been made into a TV-series and I’m looking forward to watching it."

Of course, I had to read it. I'm glad it didn't disappoint. The only disappointment is the not-too-happy -ending for the hopeless romantic me. But plot-wise, I'm kind of reminded a little of Harlan Coben's plots, even writing-wise actually except Coben's is cheesier and funnier. So my verdict: I love that the book empowers a woman character written by a woman author. Overall, the book is not bad for a thriller but I'm not so sure about it being the best thriller choice.

I read this out of sheer curiosity even though I don’t believe in those awards anymore and this book further proves why. Hannah’s husband Owen disappears, leaving tons of money for his daughter Bailey. Hannah and Bailey (her step-daughter) work together through their grief but also trying to figure out what happened. Basically, there’s no thrill or mystery. Even though they were technically in danger, there didn’t feel like there was any. Some of it was so unrealistic that you definitely have to suspend belief to get through it. The ending also didn’t make much sense to me. I would say this is another family drama book.What I did like was Bailey and Hannah’s relationship and how they grew closer together. Owen himself, felt like a ghost. He’s what the whole book is based on but we literally don’t meet him. This book needed flashbacks or his POV or SOMETHING but it had none of those. Overall, this was very okay. "
285,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1386008-james,Rating 1 out of 5,"Dumb. This book is just unbelievably stupid. One would have to suspend disbelief so high they’d suffocate from a lack of air to think any of this is plausible. The following things actually occur in this book:The Mob/Mafia have a major presence in Austin, TX.A mother decides that yeah, I’d love my daughter’s dangerous mafia lawyer grandfather to … spend as much time as possible with my daughter? Someone describes cacio e Pepe as having not just olive oil, but salty olive oil.Someone’s job is described as “chief coder.” Not CTO, not Senior Engineer (or a thousand other job titles that a quick google search would reveal as options) but chief coder. The book is just lazy.Which brings me to my other criticism, which is that the author either has no actual sense of how time works, or is two lazy to figure out when the actual historical events she references occurred. Again, a quick google search would reveal:That the math on one professor’s age doesn’t check out, because he’s both a genius and somehow started teaching right out of college at the age of 41.That in order for one character to sneak out to see Star Wars at midnight he would’ve had to have been a 9 year old high school senior. That OxyContin didn’t exist before the year 1995.The main three characters don’t exist as living breathing human beings, but as rough sketches of people. Hannah is “good mother” with no other characteristics or clear internal drivers. Bailey is “surly teenager” and she never moves beyond that in a believable way. Owen (the husband) is “perfect husband” from the beginning and nothing changes that - he’s morally exonerated in the most unbelievable ways multiple times. No one in this book has any depth or motivation. Other characters are caricatures. The professor is old and grumpy, the ex-boyfriend is smarmy and full of himself, the best friend is basically a 30 year old Nancy drew who would “do anything” for her friend for no discernible reason, the tech CEO is a criminal & fraud - but we never know why or for what reason. The mob boss character comes out with a bodyguard and two guard dogs. It’s all bordering on farce. I could go on. Ultimately the author seems lazy, the book is lazily written, and there are some points when you can almost hear her shrugging through the prose, as if to say, eh, I’ll get my TV deal out of this so who cares if it makes sense.She brags about the TV deals in her bio, so ultimately she’s the one laughing to the bank and I was foolish enough to waste my time on this inexcusable drivel."

However, if you just want a novel that you can't put down and will keep you glued to the page NEEDING to know what comes next, I highly recommend!When Owen's company is taken down during a raid and it comes to light that the business has been lying to the public and engaging in massive fraud, it doesn't look good that Owen up and disappears to avoid arrest or implication at the same time. Worse, he leaves his new wife, Hannah, and his daughter, Bailey, a bag full of cash and a note to Hannah simply saying ""Protect her"". Hannah, convinced of Owen's innocence despite how everything may look, decides to set off on an expedition with Bailey to uncover the truth. What she finds along the way will not only shock her and reveal that everything she knows about her husband may not be the truth, but also put her and Bailey in harm's way.This was a really fun read full of mystery and suspense. I wouldn't classify it as a thriller but it did keep me at the edge of my seat and it was fun trying to figure out just what the heck was going on! Regarding the believability, the storyline was admittedly pretty far fetched. Much of Hannah and Bailey solving the mystery relied on fragmented conversations and gut feelings Hannah remembered about Owen from years prior, and even more out there, memories Bailey pulled out of thin air from when she was four years old. While some of these leaps made me roll my eyes or have to backtrack to figure out 'wait, how did they put that together?!', they didn't ultimately take away from the story for me. Definitely a unique and fast read, one I would highly recommend!"

Some of the worst books I read that year were trashy thrillers (The Hunting Wives, In My Dreams I Hold a Knife, Survive the Night, Local Woman missing, Rock Paper Scissors 🤮🤮) or mysteries wrong marketed as such (The Other Black Girl -for which I've seen the TV series and it's awful 🤢 - or The Push). The Last Thing He Told Me is a mystery (not a thriller), it's fast paced (not a common trait in mysteries which usually are slow paced, dragging and sometimes just boring), it's got unexpected turns and a bittersweet ending that got my emotions 😭 (the first time). The premise is simple but the writing is engaging and that's what counts: the journey should be entertaining even if the story isn't the most original thing ever written! Although it's been years since my first read, I flew by it because I remembered almost every single plot point, so I'm keeping my original rating intact. It deserved to win the 2021 GCA Best Mystery & Thriller in my opinion 😁 About the TV series: unlike recent disappointment ""Lessons in Chemistry"", the author was fully involved in the production of the series and even wrote some of the episodes. I guess that made all the difference because the minor changes that were made in the course of the series didn't diverge from the book's main plot, turns and ending. Good adaptation, faithful to the source material. Jennifer Garner is too old to play Hannah but she can do that kind of role in her sleep, so it's fine. There are 7 episodes, all around 40 minutes or less, which made it perfect to binge-watch 👏"

I was hesitant to start this because I’ve never read a book that is exclusively mystery. But wow. This was perfect. I cried reading the last line. It was the ideal combination of mystery, angst, betrayal, smart women, and secrets. The writing and the pace made it all the more special. Definitely reading more Laura Dave.I loved how the author showed us how their relationship came to be. How normal and almost boring Owen and Hannah seemed to be and still their relationship and their little moments seemed almost magical. I really really loved that. Normal feelings and normal people that together are extraordinary.For a while there I was pretty mad because I thought they were gonna end up together but I loved how the story played out in the end. I absolutely loved how Hannah didn’t need a man by the beginning of the book and she didn’t need a man by the end. I loved her story. Her normal but fascinating story. Her unproblematic life that was almost defined by these big hardships she had to face. How it seemed she and Owen were made for each other but they would’ve been fine on their own too.All the stars for this masterpiece👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 What a beautifully written book. I’m definitely getting into mystery after reading this."

The narrator sounded like your best friend after breaking up —and going back with their partner ughhh.the characters were not at all lifelike, the narrator wanted to seem ‘all nice’ and all but was actually nothing more than a foolish, shallow wife who’s crazy in love with her husband (whoever he was). the teenage daughter… ugh don’t let me even begin. teenagers might be aggressive (I mean.. why not!) but they definitely are not such… how can I say it… such prigs! apparently the writer was exposed to such a monsters all her life calling them teens. the husband, Owen? I wanna keep it spoiler free but I’m gonna say I might like him the most among all characters (not that I like any) and guess why, cause he wasn’t even present in the story hehe. I dread talking about the plot. the whole thing was like a pre-pre-pre-writing of a supposed-to-be-awesome story. like it sounded nothing more than an idea, someone was making up in their mind before going to bed. I wanna use the word ‘shallow and unstimulating’ but still not sure. I’m still not recovered from such a terrible read. "

In my opinion, the cartel that’s running drugs are not going to let Hannah Hall & Bailey Michaels just keep on living their lives with no repercussions with the cartel knowing their identities.If they want Owen Michaels that bad, they’ll use his wife and daughter as bait.It doesn’t matter what clout Bailey’s grandfather has, they’ll do what they have to do because they are ruthless and brutal. They're the cartel! 😂And that’s why I don’t buy the conclusion or how it all wraps up.Am I glad I read this?

Suddenly, Hannah finds herself having to figure out what happened to her husband and what he could possibly mean by his message. His company, The Shop is being taken down one by one for embezzling and fraud, and Owen created the software.The tension was written so well in the first 3/4. I couldn't stop reading this, it hit all the right notes and I was desperate to figure this mystery out along with Hannah and her stepdaughter Bailey. I didn't love the parts once we started unraveling the mystery.  Why did we need to bring in the whole Nicholas Bell thing?!

I had absolutely no clue what I was starting when I picked this one up and I had never read this author before, either. This story will grip you with the prologue! Then it goes on to establish a solid character background with part one and completely captivates the reader for parts two and three. I was drawn into this story and couldn't put it down until I knew the answer to the mystery. This is a compelling mystery with a very touching and sincere subplot exploring the relationship between a step mother and daughter. The tension is realistic and palatable. There were parts I had ""figured out"" or ""predicted"" but that did not take away from my enjoyment of the story at all. I thoroughly enjoyed this read and would recommend it to anyone looking for a mild thriller with a great mystery. Thank you Netgalley, Simon & Schuster, and Laura Dave for a #gifted copy of this book. "

For me, it was an overall good read that moved at a quick pace.Hannah is left in total shock and confusion when her husband, Owen, suddenly disappears without warning. Suddenly Hannah and Bailey (Hannah’s stepdaughter/Owen’s daughter) are thrown into a situation where they must solve this mystery of a puzzle with only a couple of pieces. The pressure is intensified by the tense relationship between Hannah and Bailey… sixteen-year-old Bailey wasn’t exactly thrilled to begin with at having Hannah as her stepmother. Now with Owen missing, the stress takes on a new level. I enjoyed the plot of this book and how quickly it moved. There were pieces of the story that felt open-ended and parts that made me go 🤔 but, as a whole, it was a fun summer read!"

But then Owen goes missing…leaving behind only the words “Protect Her”…After that you are hook line and sinkered as the author takes you on a twisty path towards the truth. Perfectly set and cleverly layered this is one of those unpredictable stories that doesnt disappoint with its final denouement.I loved it. Definitely one of the best psychological drama’s you’ll read this year.Highly recommended."

302,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24156068-christina-loeffler,Rating 5 out of 5,"4.5, gotta love a fresh take on the usually formulaic mystery/thriller genre stars!!How well do you really know the people you love? How well do you really know your spouse? The Last Thing He Told Me takes an intimate look at those questions through our main character Hannah. When Hannah met Owen, he took her by complete surprise. Hannah never felt the need to have ""another half"", she was whole in her career as a woodturner and on her own. But when Owen walked through her shop doors, with his charming and disarmingly genuine smile she didn't stand a chance. Fast forward two years and she's married to Owen, she's uprooted her entire life and moved to Sausalito to live in his floating home with his less than stoked 16 year old daughter. A regular, mundane, normal day quickly turns into her worst nightmare when Hannah receives a mysterious note from Owen with only the words ""protect her"" written on them. Owen doesn't come home, he doesn't answer his phone and soon the SEC is raiding the company he worked for and FBI agents are showing up at her door. Who was her husband? How does she protect her step daughter who wants less than nothing to do with her but is hurting and spiraling along with her? This is the thing about good and evil. They aren't so far apart - and they often start from the same valiant place of wanting something to be different. This is my first novel by Laura Dave and let me just say - I loved it! I was hooked from not just the beginning but the synopsis itself. Once I cracked the spine and dove in (despite having been in a wicked book slump for what feels like an eternity) I couldn't step away. There's a formula to mystery/thriller novels that can make them a bit predictable and when you read too many of them close together, they can start to run together. A common trope relied upon within the genre is the unlikable characters with an unreliable narrator. What I really loved about The Last Thing He Told Me is that it didn't rely on that trope at all. None of the characters were unreliable or unlikable. Their motives were grounded in altruism and love, they moved forward in ways that made sense, that the reader could honestly connect with. All this without losing the need to turn the page, to find out what happens next. ""It drove me crazy. The hundredth time I had to do it, I actually think I went a little crazy."" He paused. ""And you know the only thing worse than that? The day she stopped.""At the core of this novel is the story of a parent who loves his child, and the story of a bonus parent who is willing to give everything of herself for that child. Having recently had a baby myself, I'm not sure if it's hormones or just Dave's ability to ring emotion out of her readers but I found her descriptions of parenthood to be heartbreakingly real. Despite her focus on the depth of her characters, the mystery aspect didn't suffer at all. She dealt details and crumbs for the reader with a deft hand that left me hurtling to the end of the novel and I read it in two days flat (which I haven't done in a long time). The reason I docked the .5 is a personal gripe to be honest. The story is set in Sausalito, California and Austin, Texas. I'm from and was born and raised in Austin so when I originally saw it mentioned I couldn't help my ""oooh, hell yeah, go Austin!"" squeal. It likely would only feel this way to someone from there or someone intimately familiar with the area but it was a bit like Dave just googled ""Austin highlights"" and then described them from an outsiders perspective - not necessarily as someone who has actually experienced it and it was a bit distracting for me. Austin was given a significant amount of detail that wasn't afforded to Sausalito and it pulled me out of the story and became a bit like an ad versus a general description of setting. Maybe we are all fools, one way or another, when it comes to seeing the totality of the people who love us - the people we try to love.In the end, I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a page turner that doesn't fall into annoyingly typical tropes. If you're looking for a novel driven by main characters that lack the nefarious motives you find in many mystery/thriller novels than this one is for you! I'll definitely be picking up more books by Laura Dave because she clearly knows what she's doing. "

304,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5990485-mary,Rating 4 out of 5,"I have been seeing a lot of love for The Last Thing He Told Me by Laura Dave and now I can see why! This is a slow-burn mystery of where Hannah's husband has disappeared to, and I love that it sent her on a sleuthing expedition to Austin, Texas with her stepdaughter Bailey. Even though I consider it a slow burn, it is still quite pacy and didn't feel slow when I was reading it. I was fully invested in finding out what happened to Owen, and what she finds completely surprised me. Hannah was a bit of a badass, and I really loved her as a character and that the whole book is told from her perspective. Dave really brought the setting to life through her writing, and I could picture Austin as clear as day while Hannah and Bailey are there poking around trying to figure Owen out. I also thought it was great that there are two different timelines in the novel - one is in the past and talks about Owen and Hannah's relationship, and then of course present time after he disappears. Through the past timeline, we also get to see how Bailey and Hannah interacted, and it was nice to see how their relationship evolved throughout the novel.The audiobook for The Last Thing He Told Me was also fantastic and narrated by Rebecca Lowman. I have actually listened to this narrator before and think she is really great at what she does. She was the perfect person to voice this book, and she really brought the characters and story to life for me in the way that only a very talented narrator can when mixed with a great writer. I think she also kept me even more interested in the story, and I would definitely listen to the audiobook if you like reading books with your ears. I was pretty shocked at how the novel ended which was great, and I especially loved all the different title chapters that Dave came up with. This was my first time experiencing her writing but will definitely not be my last as I loved it. It flowed so well and was perfectly descriptive without being overly descriptive to the point that I couldn't get into it. The very end made my heart squeeze a little, and some readers will definitely consider it to be a tearjerker. This was such an enjoyable and engaging read and I can't wait to read more from Dave!I received an advanced listening copy of this book. Opinions expressed in this review are completely my own."
305,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17076426-mary,Rating 1 out of 5,"Why is this book, this milquetoast soap opera of a book, written in so many sentences--convoluted yet overly earnest sentences which attempt to pierce the delicate skin of my raw emotions, but instead bounce off like a handful of dry beans flung against a window pane--why is it so preposterous, so beyond my ability to indulge it, as if reflecting the absurdity of all existence, the blandness of every question we could hope to conceive? I say the only thing I can, the only truth I know in my heart to be true after the hours of slogging through this soppy, amateurish mess: I had a choice, have always had a choice, and I chose to finish reading this, though that decision will linger in the background, always with me, plot holes and bad characterization haunting my dreams.Seriously. That's how this entire book is written. I'm sorry, but the protagonist flies to a strange city with zero information, and her entire methodology is literally to wander at random and hope her step-daughter remembers something from when she was four or that they run into someone who knew her husband decades ago*, AND IT WORKS? Then later, she gives up her marriage and life as she knows it so this teenager she's known for a year, who doesn't even like her, can have...not normalcy, because her dad is in hiding forever and she's been dumped into a family she never knew (or even knew about), but what, the golden gift of not having to change her name and move somewhere else? Right. Because that makes sense. I'm sure she'd have picked her new step-mom she doesn't connect with and some total strangers halfway across the country over having her father in her life if she had the choice. K.The husband and wife in this book deserve each other, because they are both selfish delusionals who wouldn't know reason if it punched them in the face. I'm actually a little mad I didn't DNF this book.*edit to add that I looked up the population of Austin, TX, and it's 950,000 people. Yet they find multiple clues to one guy who hasn't lived there in 20+ years without even trying very hard. Sure! Why not!"

The Last Thing He Told me is an easy to read, fast-paced thriller. One day out of the blue, after her husband fails to come, Hannah receives a note from a little girl at her doorstep. It says, ""Protect Her"". Hannah pretty quickly realises that the note is about her step-daughter Bailey, and that she is the key to solving her husband's whereabouts. Hannah turns her hand to sleuthing, and we follow the twists and turns as she uncovers the secrets in her husband's past. Is this entirely believable? No. Is it fun to read? Yes. Did I expect it to be a little more gripping? Yes ... especially since there's a pretty big 'reveal' towards the end of the book that just wallops you with information and answers after teasing you for so long.

There was wayyyy too much dialogue and we were left with no room for interpretation. The characters spelled out everything you needed to know. I hated that. Also, characters just disappeared without any follow up. What happened to Hannah’s ex (and lawyer) in New York? Did Owen’s friend ever tell his wife about his girlfriend and potential other child? What happened to Avett’s wife? Did the reporter ever go out with her colleague who secretly liked her? Also it was so repetitive. The fact finding mission at the church is legitimately the same exact situation when they talk to Owen’s old professor. They don’t get what they want so they throw a temper tantrum and then all of a sudden, these people are willing to help them. It doesn’t make sense.

Could have been a well done mystery but what I can’t get over is if he really loved his daughter so much and wanted to protect her, why would he just take off without her? If his photos would have ended up in the media, the gangster people could have still tracked his daughter/wife down and killed them to hurt him. Leaving Bailey back to protect her makes no sense. If anything, he abandoned her. Is it just me or that’s too big of a loophole? "

Основната развръзка беше супер предвидима и освен това скучна.Това, което ми допадна в романа е темата за отношенията между Бейли и Хана, а именно майка-доведена дъщеря. "

326,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/121000084-jennifer-nottoomanybooks,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book has been on my shelf for far too long, and with the tv show out now, I knew I needed to read it! Why….why did I wait so long to read this? It was soooooo good! A story about family, a man with a past having to disappear to save those he loves most. A step mom and teenage stepdaughter who bump heads working together to piece together the mystery of why he left them. It was beautiful and realistic how their relationship grew to become close. I loved everything about this book. How it started, the middle and the ending was superb! I can’t wait to watch the tv show now and I hope it lives up to how wonderful the novel is. Has anyone seen it yet? Thoughts?"
327,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/120558016-ruei-ruei-s-reading-corner,Rating 4 out of 5,"Full Review: https://rueisreadingcorner.blogspot.c...Hannah Hall is married to Owen Michaels for a year when Owen suddenly disappears one day. The only thing he leaves behind is a note that says ""Protect her."" But out of everyone it could possibly be, Hannah knows it means Bailey, Owen's teenage daughter. Within twenty-four hours, the life Hannah once knew shatters. It's now up to Hannah and Bailey to solve the mystery of Owen's disappearance. It definitely doesn't help that a U.S. Marshal shows up at Hannah's doorstep and that the CEO of the company Owen works for is arrested. Front news everywhere, it's only a matter of time before Owen's name is exposed to the press and there's no turning back.In honor of the TV show that is releasing recently, I decided to read this book. I finished it in a morning and all I can say is wow. I literally got up at four to read this, not knowing what to expect but the book really surprised me.Hannah and Bailey I love. I really liked how loving and patient Hannah was with Bailey throughout the entire novel. It must have been hard for Hannah but also for her to consider and try to understand Bailey's feelings in the midst of the situation. And I have to say, the last chapter omg my heart!Overall, The Last Thing He Told Me genuinely surprised me. I thought that maybe it had been overhyped but it definitely didn't disappoint. I will say, however, it was a little short but I still liked it nonetheless.**Update: The TV show omg the scenery is just absolutely gorgeous <3"

329,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11267295-sharon,Rating 3 out of 5,"This book felt more like a mystery than a thriller and it wasn’t a book that had me on the edge of my seat. But in saying all of that I did enjoy it and I was intrigued to find out how it was going to end. For me, if a book is supposed to be a thriller, mystery or suspense I want it to be fast-paced and a bit of a page-turner, but this one lacked that, so if you are looking for something along those lines this is not the book for you. But of course, that’s my opinion, so don’t let my review stop you from reading this as you might love it. "
