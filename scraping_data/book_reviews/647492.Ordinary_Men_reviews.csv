It's about a Reserve Police Battalion in Poland. This was a bunch of middle-aged German guys who were unfit for military service, so they were given an easier job, which was to shoot Jewish people and bury them in woods (okay, the last bit could be hard, but generally you could get the Jewish people to do all the digging before you shot them).This was the pre-industrial phase of the Holocaust, before the purpose-built death camps at Treblinka, Sobibor and Belzec were opened for business. Who rounded up these Jewish families from their little villages and marched them into the forests and gunned them down and then came back the next day and drove to a new village and did it all over again, week after week? As I say it wasn't the steely-eyed fanatical SS psychos barking ""schnell! schnell!"" with the big Alsation dogs at all, it was these middle-aged police reserve guys, your local baker, pharmacist or gardener, just your regular guys. Now some of them found it - well, frankly, a little too disturbing, shooting men women and children in cold blood week after week. So Browning points out that they could ask to be transferred to other duties and that was okay, they'd be transferred, no hard feelings. No problem.Now Browning was influenced by the famous Stanley Milgram electric-shock experiment. But I was thinking that maybe the conclusions Milgram and later experimenters have come to aren't quite right. I'm not a psychologist so I'm probably wrong, but here goes. Milgram et al have said that the presence of an authority who normalises certain actions which in other contexts would be considered sadistic and criminal explains the actions of the randomly-selected people who applied the fake fatal electric shocks. But considering the grim evidence presented in this book, not to mention many examples from elsewhere (Srebrenitsa, Rwanda, Cambodia, the witch craze of the middle ages), maybe its this : that there are a large number of people in every society who just don't have a moral sense at all. They go along with convention, so you don't notice them, they're not psychopaths, they don't crave power, but if you ask them to shoot a family of seven on a beautiful summer day and bury the bodies in the woods they'll just say okay, but I got to get back by five, my wife will be expecting me."
1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4674014-marquise,Rating 5 out of 5,"On a reread, the same points struck me as in the first time round, but none sticks out more glaringly this time than the matter of choice.➼ These men from the Ordnungspolizei were given a choice to participate or abstain when they were ordered to carry out their first massacre of 1,500 Jews at Józefów, and only one man took his commander up on the offer. One man. And he was screamed at for being the first one with a conscience. After him, only eleven more chose to do the same. A dozen men in a battalion of 500. Thus: Befehl ist befehl had its limitations, and there were loopholes the size of Goering's paunch to slip through. And they could escape punishment, too, in fact all of them who refused escaped reprisals.➼ These men weren't indoctrinated fanatics, they were the most ordinary of ordinary men: middle and working class, craftsmen and tradesmen, blue collar workers if you will. Many weren't even Nazi Party members, many had no bad feelings towards Jews, many were married men with children, respectable citizens, some were even religiously observant persons.Thus: The image of all Holocaust perpetrators as fanatical monsters isn't correct. Of course there were those as well (Dirlewanger Brigade, anyone?), but for the ""average"" perpetrator there was a medley of reasons that compelled them to participate that had nothing to do with racial hate or Nazi doctrine, things like peer pressure, what your brothers-in-arms will think of you, fear of looking cowardly and failing at your job, etc., etc., even simple desensitisation in the classic psychological model.➼ The way the desensitisation process worked with the men of Reserve Police Battalion 101 would've had psychologist experts Zimbardo and Milgram busy for ages; it worked shockingly smoothly in my opinion (though I have to consider the wartime psychological context). After Józefów, the men were angry and bitter and drunk themselves into a stupor to ""wash out"" the memories of the massacre, but by the time of their second massacre they were already desensitised enough that their commander, who had cried like a baby and offered them a way out of participating, in the end didn't have any scruples with adding 180 Jews to the tally just to fill his quota when ordered to do an Oradour-style reprisal massacre of the Poles at a town for the death of a German policeman. Thus: Through desensitisation and routinisation, by the end all these men were so brutalised that even those who had initially refused to shoot did, in the end, shoot. There were refusals and disobeying orders till the very end, though, indicating that some did manage to keep their conscience as much as they could manage.➼ Post-war, they were full of the usual excuses, all about the people and none about ethics and morality of the actions. Browning says that perhaps the fact that these men weren't highly educated is why they don't give particularly sophisticated explanations as to their motives, which sounds plausible enough.Thus: Whilst they aren't lying as to why they themselves participated or refused, you won't find anything very deep from their motivations, which is left to Browning (and ultimately the reader) to find and expose. You will, however, see signs of cognitive dissonance in some of the policemen's explanations, like the one who managed to tell himself he was doing Jewish children a favour by shooting them because their parents had already died and thus ""they'd die anyway.""It's not an easy book, it shows what a ""descent into madness"" situation truly looks like, and it isn't like in the films. There's no simple cause and effect, no simple linear progression, no simple motives."

A large majority were working-class, and more than half were aged between 37 and 42. Being above the age group considered suitable for the frontline, they were deployed in implementing the “Final Solution”. The soldiers deported Jews to Treblinka, and also carried out mass shootings. The author estimates that this single battalion transported 45,000 Jews to death camps and directly murdered at least another 38,000. In the 1960s, 210 surviving members were interrogated about Holocaust crimes, and the testimony they provided forms the basis of this book. The author acknowledges that the evidence given should be treated with caution. The men clearly wanted to avoid incriminating themselves. That said, he argues the interviews were carried out by skilful attorneys, who drew out some gruesome testimony.The age of the men meant they had been well into adulthood by the time the Nazis took power. They had not spent their formative years under the “inverted morality” of Nazism. Moreover prior to 1933 support for the Nazis had been weak in Hamburg. Most working-class people in the city had supported either the Communists or the Social Democrats. It’s reasonable to conclude that most of the Battalion’s troops were not committed Nazis. So what led these ordinary German family men to commit such horrendous crimes?Browning suggests that the Battalion divided into three groups. Some were sadists who went out of their way to torture, beat and humiliate Jews before murdering them. Another group, the largest, simply followed orders. A third group, between 10% and 20%, asked to be excused from shooting Jews or otherwise evaded doing so. No punishment was inflicted upon this group. This surprised me as I had always considered the Nazis as intolerant of any challenge to authority. None of the soldiers objected to serving on the Treblinka transports. They knew that the Jews would be killed but their role ended when the victims were delivered to the camp – “out of sight, out of mind”. It was less easy to evade moral responsibility when directly murdering defenceless civilians.The author concludes that the relentless and pervasive denigration of Jews in Nazi Germany did affect the attitudes of the men of RPB101, but he also argues that deference to authority and pressure of conformity were uppermost in explaining their participation in mass murder. Those soldiers who did not participate in the shootings were derided by the others as weak or cowardly. They were also viewed as shirkers who relied on their comrades to do “dirty work”.Browning’s conclusions were strongly criticised by Daniel Goldhagen, author of “Hitler’s Willing Executioners”, a book I haven’t read. This edition contains an afterword in which he responds to those criticisms. There is also an interesting aside about 14 Luxembourgers who were assigned to the Battalion, and whether they behaved any differently from the Germans. Browning doesn’t think they did.This is a thoughtful piece of work in which the author rehearses a variety of potential psychological explanations for the actions of RPB101, and the extent to which the capacity for violence lies within all of us.

""Explaining is not excusing; understanding is not forgiving.""
Leo Tolstoy once said that “to understand everything is to forgive everything.” However, this is not always the case, and this book shows it.C.R. Browning studies one of the Nazi Police Battalions (Reserve Police Battalion 101) deployed in Poland during the Second World War. Not surprisingly, Ordinary Men is a difficult read. Talking about books that describe world tragedies is never easy. Nevertheless, I will try to summarize the impressions the book left on me.The men from the Battalion in question were part of those who directly perpetrated crimes of the Holocaust. Their task was to execute the orders, no matter how inhumane and gruesome.The author traces the moral degradation of those men and demonstrates how quickly they ceased to feel remorse about what they were to do.The records, even though often little more than a confusing array of perspectives and memories, testify that, when first faced with the commands to kill defenseless people, the members of the Police Battalion seemed to hesitate. Many were reluctant to proceed with the orders to shoot Jewish people, among whom were children.Some were reported to have experienced distress and anxiety. Thus, having finished their gruesome ‘job’ during the first massacre (The Józefów Massacre), many of them got drunk to forget what had just happened. However, committing such crimes repeatedly made their internal resistance, whatever it might be, come to a vanishing point. They quickly became accustomed to ghetto clearing, deportation, and mass shootings.Before WWII most of them, as the title of the book implies, were just ordinary men. Most of them had families and ordinary occupations.All the evidence points out that they were average citizens without a specific propensity for violence. It took only several months for these men to turn into mass murderers who considered exterminating thousands of people a routine.The combination of the peculiar circumstances embedded in the Nazi regime paved the way for such moral distortion. A climate of political violence and frenetic hatred cultivated towards those regarded as ‘racially inferior’ could not fail to take its toll on these men. They had been living in a society where violence and repression were common currency long enough to imbibe the ‘values’ characteristic of the Third Reich.The policemen could step out and refuse to comply with the orders to kill their victims. They could apply for reassignment to some other task.The Battalion members had opportunities, it seems, of not doing at least some of the things they committed. Escaping direct participation in the massacres was possible. Often, at least at the beginning, their refusal would not have to entail any dire consequences.But most did not do that.One of the motives behind their behavior might be a fear to look like a coward in the eyes of their comrades. They were probably afraid of “losing face” in public.Few refused to participate in mass killings, whereas the majority showed conformism and accepted without demur the ‘rules’, sometimes even trying to show themselves “more royalist than the king.”The corollary that one can draw from this micro-historic research is quite scary. Almost any person might under certain circumstances turn into a monster. Peer pressure and natural conformism could negatively influence an individual's personality.Most people seek social approval. They could do this by trying to ingratiate themselves with their fellow citizens, colleagues, or those on whom they depend. When societal norms resemble those prevalent under the Nazi, it is little wonder that the men from the Battalion did what they did.The concept of the “banality of evil” formulated by Hannah Arendt may come to mind. The most evil things are often carried out by ordinary people."

The men of RPB 101 were just middle-aged German men who participated in mass shootings as well as rounding up Jews for deportation to Nazi death camps in Poland in 1942. Even more horrifying is that they were not fanatical Nazis - so how did they come to gaze so deeply into the abyss? Christopher R. Browning presents us with an explanation that is informed, original and disturbing."

It was supposed to be, so to speak, soothing to my conscience to release children unable to live.'They went through their formative period in a pre-Nazi era, came from Hamburg one of the least Nazified cities in Germany, they belonged to social class that had been anti-Nazi, just how could these non-conforming end up killing innocent women, childern and men with little compulasion? The answer lies with the ideology of the German volk, which faced a constant struggle for survival ordained by nature, according to whose laws “all weak and inferior are destroyed” and “only the strong and powerful continue to propagate.” To win this struggle, the Volk needed to do two things: conquer living space to provide for further population growth and preserve the purity of the German race over all other types of ideologies propgating equality of mankind like Christianity, Liberlaism and Marxism.Jews were deemed responsbile for Liberalism and Marxism. The vast majority of unit 101 choose to conform y breaking ranks, nonshooters were leaving the “dirty work” to their comrades. Since the battalion had to shoot even if individuals did not, refusing to shoot constituted refusing one’s share of an unpleasant collective obligation. It was in effect an asocial act vis-à-vis one’s comrades. Those who did not shoot risked isolation, rejection, and ostracism—a very uncomfortable prospect within the framework of a tight-knit unit stationed abroad among a hostile population, so that the individual had virtually nowhere else to turn for support and social contact.Much more work needs to be undertaken not to repeat such bevauoirs in future culture, all the dangerous signs have to be listed and graded with clear red lines so that all future ideologies can be vetted for any repeat of murder of such scale."
7,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5862503-sweetwilliam,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is not an easy read. First, it reads like a scholarly thesis paper that someone wrote for a doctoral thesis. Second, the subject matter is awful and there are no heroes. Having said this, Christopher Browning’s Ordinary Men is an integral read for those of us trying to make sense of the Holocaust. I decided to read Browning’s book because I wanted more insight into the psyche of the monsters that were ordered to carry out Hitler’s final solution. According to Browning, for the most part, the men of Battalion 101 were just ordinary men. I read the title of the book prior to buying it so I guess I shouldn’t be surprised. Browning’s analysis is clear: These men were not SS troopers and they had not been subjected to intense indoctrination or any type of brainwashing. There were very few party members. I can only remember Browning mentioning one officer that was a former member of the Hitler youth. I believe that only a few were ever in the SS prior to deployment in Poland. They were certainly not front line troops suffering from any type of combat fatigue. In fact, they hadn’t heard a shot fired in anger and there wasn’t anything frontline about them. Browning argued that they were the dregs of the Wehrmacht and they were deemed not fit for frontline duty. Most importantly, these men didn’t even seem to harbor a grudge against the Jews. With scarce exception, they hardly seemed to enjoy their task. So why did they do it? According to Browning’s interpretation of events, they did it because they were ordered to. They knew this was wrong. The Battalion Commander, Major Trapp, was a decorated combat veteran from WWI. Trapp told the enlisted men that they could be excused if they could not take part in the firing squads and then he went to an office and bawled like a baby. I took some solace that about 14 men and one officer refused to take part in the massacre and that several men refused to continue after taking part in the initial firing squad but at the end of the day, somehow the deed was done. Future actions were easier to handle in part because the killing grew more routine. Also, the policemen found ways to farm out the killing to others. They recruited Hiwis (foreigners) to do the dirty work. This included Russian prisoners (Trawnikis) who would have starved had they not been given the option to serve the Nazis. Also, the Policemen didn’t mind loading the Jews on railcars so that they could be shipped off to a death camp where others could execute them. This was much more preferable than rounding up families and personally killing them. The worst thing was to have to kill innocent people face-to-face. The author compares and contrasts the massacres committed by the Policemen to other war crimes committed during that period By US units in the Pacific and even later in Vietnam. Browning mentions that some US units in the Pacific had boasted of taking no prisoners and that there were units that collected ears etc. However, Browning makes the point that at the time these men were under duress due to combat fatigue and they had reacted to it. These policemen, on the other hand, hadn’t heard a shot fired in anger so the policemen could certainly not use this as a mitigating factor. I also personally believe that the massacres of the Polish Jews are very different than the massacres of the Chinese citizens of Nanking. Correct me if I’m wrong, but the Japanese perpetrated massacres weren’t sanctioned by high command or the Imperial Government. I remember reading Ira Chang’s Rape of Nanking and reading one of the commanding General’s correspondence that imperial soldiers were acting like Genghis Khan. Iwane Matsui, the commanding General of IJA in China, gave strict orders not to harm Chinese citizens or loot. Ironically, Matsui was a great admirer of China and chastised his officers for what happened in Nanking but ultimately, this did not save him from the hangman’s noose. The implementation of the Final Solution in Poland was the exact opposite. The ordinary men of the reserve police battalion were ordered by Himmler at Hitler’s wishes to kill all men, women, and children and to shoot infants and the infirm on sight. These policemen certainly would not have carried out these massacres without orders to do so. However, they still did it and this bothers me. With a minimum of psychobabble, Browning tries to compare the actions of the Policemen with some University studies where students acting as prisoners were given fake shocks. I’m sorry, but some of this was lost on me. I believe it had little relevance to a reserve policemen being asked to blow a hole at point blank range through a defenseless child’s neck and getting spattered with their brains at times. To me it was a vain attempt to extrapolate data from a few college snowflakes and apply it to something like the Holocaust. The use of this data almost trivialized the Holocaust to some degree. I believe that these Jews would have preferred to have been shocked a few times or even shipped off to Abu Ghraib to live out the war forming naked pyramids. Early on in the book there is a letter from a German official trying to run the local economy in the east complaining about the implementation of what later became known as the Final Solution. The official claimed that his skilled workers at several factories either had fled or were shot or were transported to a concentration camp and how none of the remaining workers (including the White Russians) could concentrate on their jobs because family members were carted off. The implementation of the final solution made the local economy collapse at a time when Germany could least afford it. It makes one take a step back for a moment and wonder what could have been accomplished if the Germans would have used their precious resources (rolling stock, manpower etc.) trying to defeat the Russians? The Jews could have been left alone and even recruited to join the war effort. I wonder if we would all be eating sauerkraut and sausage three times a day.At the end of the day I am still not quite sure why these men went through with carrying out these orders? There were no reprisals if you didn’t take part other than peer pressure. Let us not underestimate the power of peer pressure. Would men today do the same thing if ordered? Would I have done what they did if I had been in their shoes? Would I have grabbed a machine gun and started shooting my fellow officers while yelling to the Jews in my best yiddish ""run for the hills while I hold them off?"" Probably not. I'm no Joan of Arc. I would more likely have done what Papa Trapp did. At best, I would of had the foresight to resign. As Major Trapp said during the first Jewish action “If this Jewish business is ever avenged on earth then have mercy on us Germans.” Trapp was later hanged after the war for carrying out revenge killings of Polish gentiles after a partisan action. Even this Trapp tried to mitigate. I believe the hangman’s noose may have been good medicine for a man that most likely had lived out a tortured existence knowing what he was ultimately responsible for. In my review of ""Our Crime was Being Jewish"" I said that the men and women who perpetrated the Holocaust should be hunted down and tried for these crimes until they take their last breath on earth. Christopher Browning’s research indicates all events are not that black and white. You would have to hang several ordinary men that you are probably no better than. Thank God every day that we Americans currently live under a different set of circumstances. Judging others is never that easy."

No one else would be capable of that. Bitch, please! (Of course, I don't have a photo selection of myself with black people I got on well with as she does. So I MUST be a racist, coming from the American South as I do.) I can't help but think of Mitford, that poster child for hypocrisy, for calling something other than what it is for whatever self serving agenda she felt like preaching. Christopher R. Browning's book Ordinary Men Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland is a hell of a book and interesting to me for more reasons than one of my messy goodreads reviews (did I mention that is my 600th?) could cover. Paul Bryant's review says that it changed his life. It also changed mine for those reasons of putting into context human nature aspects I can only suspect and never pin down (it's much, much too big). I want to call something for what it is, pretty much. It changes me again when I have to ask myself if I believe in the will of human nature.You may have heard of author Daniel Goldhagen's Hitler's Willing Executioners. I have, although I've never read one of his pulp(it) tomes. They took the same source information, those interviews for 1960s investigations of war crimes, the same historical texts and came to some important differences. Well, I'd say (without reading Goldhagen's book) that he was looking for an all Germans are anti-Semitic bent to fit everything into. It happened because they were looking for a reason to murder Jews. Hitler just gave them the means. It couldn't have happened to anyone else, anywhere else. Bitch, please! If you want to ignore centuries of history and the present... When someone makes a grab for power like that someone is going to get royally fucked, history says.Browning's work looks at how ""Ordinary Men"", middle aged Germans who were not professional killers, who did not roam about the countryside shooting civilians by birth for mirth, became well oiled killing machines for the Nazis. Were they just following orders? Not always, at least not in any immediate way. They weren't held at gun point. I found it interesting that only a dozen opted out when given the choice not to kill. Some followed after, some after killing twenty jews. The breaking point, if there was one, was not the same. Definitely not all. One man who went out of his way to prevent himself and his men from killing the Jews they were transporting would later force twenty old men to undress and then instructed his men to grab bats to beat to death the crawling men. What is in one man, their Captain Trapp, to deliver their orders through his tears to continue to do so? Browning says because one group did so did not mean that another would kill if in their place. It doesn't mean that another wouldn't.In the back of my mind while reading 'Ordinary Men' I had the thought that these German men felt about the Jews the way that many elsewhere in the world would feel for prison inmates. Their punishment is abstract. They could say to themselves, ""Well, they deserved what they got."" That's if they thought about them at all. The execution takes place far away. The possibility of innocence, of falling through the cracks for making a mistake (one of the most depressing things, to me, is how many are in prison because they could not afford the court costs. A fucking evil scam! I am overwhelmed with hatred of society when I think about things like that. Complacency and heartless? distraction takes many forms). They hate us for our freedom. Maybe we shouldn't have freedom, then. Maybe someone else is looking out for things for us. It's okay to drop a devastating bomb far away. Sleeeeeep sheeeeep. The only racists are in the American south. It's not bigotry to hate gays, if you're black. I've heard that one a lot. Pretending something isn't what it is by calling something else in huge bold letters. Evil! Nazis! Just them.I have no doubt that they were thinking about themselves first of all. The way that they rewrote history in their own minds is important. It also cannot be discounted that the interviews were for legal proceedings and no way were they going to even mention direct culpability or anti-Semitism. As Browning points out, that would make it intent and the intent makes it homicide. How much of a looming threat did the Nazi higher ups have that a different mind set some couple of decades later would change their side stepping of the larger implications (they massacred so many people)? I have an idea in the back of my mind that it is complacency out of selfishness. They killed because they didn't want to think about it. That the men didn't ask to leave when the option was no longer presented to them says a lot to me about going to sleep. The killings were routine and it was all something to get used to. Would they have moved for themselves? I don't even know that. (Ten officers to 8,000 Jews and they didn't revolt? We're just being resettled.)Would I call them Ordinary Men? It doesn't take an extraordinary man to do what they did. Yet, so many have done what they have, not just in Nazi territory, that I don't know what else to call them. I'd say talking about it to call it anything is better than not talking about it. The ordinary men didn't talk about it, not even when they were talking about it.Five fucking stars. It is not an ordinary man who will look into the lowest of humankind and not pretend. There was much more I wanted to write here and now my mind is too numb with statistics (600 reviews) that I can't even say anything nice now. People sure can suck. What do I call it, again? (Fascism?)And I realize I didn't break any new ground here but that's really why I love this so much. It's tangible proof of this darkness. I held it in my hand. Not just numbers."

It focuses on the really ordinary men who made up this unit and partook in the killing of thousands of Jewish women, children and the old and sickly by firing squad. It is very graphic in the description of the executions in it's brutality and one cannot fathom how the majority of these men carried out such heinous crimes. Writing this review brings a lot of emotions out of me as a father of a child and to think that these men murdered children with such ease is sickening. And while it is easy to judge what they did in those times and under the circumstances that they did it, to kill a child, not to mention a human being, in the way they did it, is unforgivable."
10,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5153787-geevee,Rating 3 out of 5," Reserve Police Battalion 101 (RPB101) was a uniformed unit of the German Order Police [Ordnungspolizei or Orpo] with a full-strength complement of c450-500 officers and men. The Ordnungspolizei were formed in 1936 and operated as the main police and fire service for the domestic Reich. Its role from 1939 expanded with its original function moving externally to the German Reich to support combat operations as lines of communication police functionaries in policing enemy civilians, guarding prisoners and salvaging equipment. Quickly, however the role of police battalions expanded to include anti-partisan and the genocide of the Jews. It is this latter that this book covers. RPB101 deployed on active service as part of the Poland invasion force in September 1939 rounding up polish soldiers and guarding prisoner-of-war camps. In December 1939, some 100 regular career policeman were recalled to form additional police units with RPB101's replacements being middle-aged men. After this, the battalion undertook training and then deployed again to Litzmannstadt (Lodz) in Poland in May 1940 to undertake ""resettlement"" operations, which it completed in April 1941, returning again to its home area of Hamburg. It then undertook three Jewish deportation operations within the Hamburg area taking these unfortunate people by train to ghettos at Litzmannstadt, Minsk and Riga. Professor Browning ably takes the reader (listener in my case) through these early beginnings and the deportation operations, describing the background structure to the battalion and the detail to the deportations and the locations the Jews were to be transported to. We meet the men who commanded or made up RPB101, and with some personnel changes during the period of operations, from post-war interviews and legal case notes hear what they thought, did and said of their time with the battalion. The train journeys with the treatment on the Jewish people, including the sheer numbers placed into carriages, and their loss of life by crush injuries, thirst and heat exhaustion, are described, as are the desperate attempts by some Jews to escape. This is placed alongside the poor organisation of the guards and details of the journey with the need to patch the trains up at various stations along the route as the desparate hands of people clawed away at barbed wire and wooden planking. The guard details had, as they described, little ammunition; but they expended hundreds of rounds each exhausting their supplies on these journeys. RPB101 then redeployed again to Poland in Summer 1942 and took part in ""Aktion"". The first was at a rural village called Józefów, which is located near the modern Polish southern border. It had a population of just under 3000 Jews and some 1500 adults and children were shot by RPB101.From here it completed numerous operations, which I need not recount in detail but readers of this review will understand by now, even if one is new to the Holocaust, that the killings were done with no regard to human life. The tactics and how people were rounded up, including Poles denouncing or reporting Jewish hideouts, transported to and organised and then shot is described very clearly and chillingly in the men's own words. The last Aktion operation RPB101 undertook was around Lublin. It was called Aktion Erntefest (Operation Harvest Festival) and along with other police battalions, SS troops and Ukrainian Special Service battalions some 43,000 Jews from the Majdanek, Poniatowa and Trawniki concentration camps were murdered over just 2 (two) days. This year and half period from the Józefów massacre to the battalion's participation in Erntefest in November 1943 is a horrifying journey of death.  By war's end these ""ordinary men"", the majority conscripted middle-aged working-class men from Hamburg,  shot c38,000 Jews and moved c45,000 others  to the Treblinka gas chambers.  After this RPB101, with the war going against the Germans and the Eastern front consuming the majority of Reich combat troops and resources, they continued fighting in anti-Partisan operations.Professor Browning then provides information on what happened to the men; those who can be named or were interviewed by post-war police - noting few were pursued actively with the onset of the Cold War, although some were prosecuted in 1964 and 1968. A small number of officers were captured at war's end with two being executed - details can be found with a quick internet search, but I have chosen to not add names as this may be unwelcome for potential readers of the book. In closing, there was an interesting but surprising additional afterword in my audio book. In essence this is for want of a better description, Professor Browning's view and response to a professional spat with Daniel Goldhagen, author of  Hitler's Willing Executioners: Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust  where each interpret different aspects of RPB101's sources and seem to have done this for many years since both books were published in the 1990s. The detail, especially around research on what makes ""ordinary"" men kill like this was interesting but wrapped around the disagreements the two have all felt rather unseemly to me.However, this should not detract from what is a book that offers an angle to the wider catalogue of Holocaust books. At its centre, whether they wanted to or not; liked it or abhorred it, was the account in their own words of Ordinary Men killing, mostly by shooting, tens of thousands of men, women and children in their beds, houses, streets or woods and pits standing naked to make Poland Juden Frei.

12,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1711431-eric-w,Rating 5 out of 5,"And another in our continuing series of depressing books: Christopher Browning examines the motivation of a 500 man police battalion assigned to the rear lines of Germany's Eastern Front. This small group of men was personally responsible for the massacre of over 38,000 Jews and the deportation of some 45,000 more to Treblinka. These were not racial fanatics nor committed Nazis. Their motives were quite ordinary: careerism and peer pressure. Browning's book is based on interviews with the participants collected after the war.Not everyone blindly followed orders. The battalion's commander ordered that anyone not wishing to participate in the shootings could be excused and about 12 were. For many of the others rationalization became the order of the day. One later testified he killed only children because his partner was shooting the mothers and he did not think it was right that children should grow up without mothers.The horrifying aspect of this account is how little it took for these men to become transformed psychologically from ""normal"" people into willing participants. These were not atrocities one has come to expect from war during the heat of battle (Malmedy, My Lai, etc.), rather an institutionalized, bureaucratic government policy. That bureaucracy may be part of the cause. It distances people from their actions. Bureaucrats never saw the hideous result of their actions, seeing only their small paper-shuffling role.That still does not explain the actions of the men who were doing the actual killing. Women and children were marched up to graves they had been forced to dig and were shot point-blank in the head. The shooters were even instructed on the best location on the neck to shoot in order to save ammunition. Occasionally the killer would be splattered with brain tissue and skull parts.There was a deliberate process of dehumanization abetted by Nazi racial policies. In fact, the soldiers found it much more difficult to kill German speaking Jews, especially those who had fled Germany. They saw them not as the barbarians they had been told they were killing. Euphemisms, (protective reaction strikes) were common: killing became ""actions"" and shipping to concentration camps became ""resettlements."" Responsibility was diffused by deferring to orders from ""above"" and dividing the tasks into different parts.There was a perversion of ethical outlook, too. Those few who were revolted by what they were doing and who refused to participate were called cowards. We need to cultivate a society where those who follow individual conscience are the heroes and those who follow the crowd are the cowards.As an aside, before my Dad died, I was talking to one of the aides in his nursing home who came from Argentina. We got to talking about my years in Germany and she mentioned her grandfather had emigrated to Argentina from Germany after the war. (Little tiny red flags waving over my head.) I queried if he had been in the German army. Her response was quite unashamedly, yes, he had been in the SS. (Red Banners now waving over my head.) Then she went on to talk about how the victors rewrite history. I decided then I had to visit the men's room."
13,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29122-tim,Rating 5 out of 5,"Christopher Browning, one of the better known Holocaust scholars today, used evidence from the post-war investigations of Police Battalion 101 to create an image of the ""ordinary men"" who participated in the massacre of Jews in Eastern Europe. By examining testimony, documents, and diary excerpts, he pieces together a chronological history of the unit’s participation and involvement in the Nazis' Final Solution. Even though Browning is writing as a scholar, with the intent of persuading through academic argument, his writing is clear and uncluttered. He approaches the subject with an easy-to-follow framework, providing a balanced look at how the battalion went from routine duties in occupied territories to the violent slaughter of Jewish civilians.Throughout Ordinary Men, Browning provides a window into the daily life of the unit and its purpose in the hierarchy and structure of the Third Reich. The often personal glimpses demonstrate the slow and methodical change in Nazi policy towards Jewish civilians, as the German leadership shifted towards the Final Solution. It's this tapestry of documentation that pulls together a remarkable look at how the extermination of European Jews occurred: through an evolving policy rather than a pre-determined course. Combined with the personal accounts of battalion members, it is easy to see the slow progression of anti-Jewish doctrine, as well as the frequently unmentioned nuances of its executioners, the most revealing of which — the lack of disciplinary action for those who refused to take part in the massacres and ""Jew hunts"" -- reveals a great deal about the make-up of the actual perpetrators. Afterword: The more recent edition of Ordinary Men has an afterword from Browning dissecting his ongoing debate with Daniel Goldhagen (author of Hitler's Willing Executioners). Personally, I’ve been surprised at how many people bought into Goldhagen's rather contradictory and ill-conceived thesis, and yet, because of that, Browning decided to add this clear-cut statement about his own conclusions in order to refute Willing Executioners' assertion that Germans are anti-Semitic by their very nature."

Any book that seeks to go behind the scenes of Nazi killing units faces the problem that the men involved invariably lie about their experience. This is very much the case here, with most of the men claiming after the war that they did their best to help Jews. I think if you're going to begin with the premise of ""ordinary men"" you need to show these men as ordinary. Provide some detail of their lives before the war, which this book doesn't do. The men in this book are just names. We learn nothing much about them. The most interesting aspect was perhaps the evidence of a prevalent macho culture among the men. As if it wasn't so much racial hatred that provoked the violence as the fear of appearing weak and cowardly to one's comrades. Also, it does debunk the often cited defence of war criminals that they had no choice. Men in this police battalion who refused to shoot unarmed civilians were not punished. But essentially this is a cataloguing of atrocities. The latter part of the book is devoted to a lengthy and somewhat repetitive summary and an argument the author is having with another author. Probably there are 100 pages that make an important contribution to Holocaust literature. The other 200 pages were of considerably less interest for me."

Recently, a lovely afternoon in the killing fields of Cambodia and a bus stop in the middle of a pogrom in progress in Myanmar have confirmed that I'm on Browning's side in this debate.

I claim that if you have not examined the eyewitness accounts and testimonies of 121 men of reserve police battalion 101 (all to be accessed by the German Bundesarchives / Archive of state prosecution of Hamburg) you will remain ignorant of a vital piece to solve the puzzle of the mass murder of not only the Jewish population but will also remain in the dark about who the people were, capable to look their hundreds of individual victims in the eyes as the ended their lives. Therefore, this is not about the desk murderers, rather it is about the men who were, again and again, confronted by the tears and desperate pleas of their victims, men saturated with the blood of victims shot at close range, assaulted by splinters of bone fragments and brain matter.The man that drowned their sorrows with the sharp taste of liquor and sweet balm of self deceptions. The men that after a day of such gruesome work wrote home to their families inquiring about their children. But equally important, neither is this about brutal SS men, that trained and indoctrinated within a cult of violence held killing as a mere expedient. This is the thoroughly researched story of average middle-aged family men who pulled the triggers.Through the shocking example of Reserve Battalion 101 it becomes clear that brutal mass murder wasn’t solely the domain of the nazified, indoctrinated reserve battalions of the SS. The murder and systematic shooting of polish and Russian Jews was not limited to the Einsatzgruppen of the SS, neither by scope nor numbers. The 500 men of Reserve Battalion alone, who except for a few WWI veterans had never had fired a shoot in anger managed to most intimate killing over 100 000 Polish and Russian Jews by shooting them execution style, one by one.This will thoroughly dissolution you of the false if convenient notion that the murderers of Jews were specially selected social outliers of the Nazi organization selected to do their dirty work unknown to the broader German society. Through the history of Reserve Battalion 101, eyewitness accounts and postwar trials it becomes manifest that the members of the broader German society - middle-aged family men themselves - were often the killers to commit the most unthinkable atrocities only to, after the war, continue their average lives in German society. These were the people who quietly picked up their pre-war occupations in the workforce or as business owners. Even more concerning to me is the relative ease with which many of them pursued careers in the police after their time with Police Battalion 101. This said, it would of course be false to assume that all members of Reserve Battalion 101 behaved the same. Any statistical distributions given there are enough members will roughly conform to three groups according to a Gaussian distribution. In the case of Reserve Battalion’s 500 members the flattened-out curve on the left is the small number of men that refused to shoot unarmed Civilians and the flattening curve on the right presents the small number that enthusiastically participated in the murders. The men presenting the opposite flat ends of the bell curve are very few. The bulge of the bell curve where most killers reside within, present the vast majority who murdered and killed for multi-layered causes such as deference to authority and peer pressure. Concluding, the author admonishes that in times of increased government legitimization, attenuated personal responsibility through bureaucratization and specialization, governments hardly ever fail to exploit racist and warlike tendencies within people to induce ordinary man to become their willing executioners. I, myself have experienced, and can attest to the almost religious deference many Germans hold authority in, their preoccupation with “power and toughness"" , their submissiveness to the former and therefore, among other precipitant reasons, their susceptibility to unquestioned servitude to a leader.A common and very successful post war defense was the dire consequences for disobedience, yet in hindsight there is not a single documented case where this was true for any of those who opted out of killing unarmed civilians. It seemed that the consequences were social ostracism rather than concrete punishment for the conscientious objector. Be that as it may, there is much to admire about the arch-American culture of the pioneer and his individualism that sets the personal spirit above group and its conventions.The law-abiding murderers got away lightly. After having individually killed hundreds of people, most simply returned to their former jobs. To this date none of the men of any of the several Reserve battalions are still alive.As a fitting closing comment perhaps, one may say that the testimonies and accounts archived in the Hamburg prosecutor’s office served history more than justice.What remains to be said is a praise for Christopher R. Browning highly academic work that avoids logical fallacies so common in the methodology of research, the tendentious selectivity of evidence and the consequently biased interpretations that lead to invalid conclusions.👁️"

When I read the title and the summary, I was very excited to start the book. It was well-researched. The opinions were well thought out. Historically, it was sound, in my very amateur opinion. However, the writing left much to be desired. It’s one thing to write a book that’s completely factual and write it in a way that keeps the audience interested. It’s another thing to write so poorly that members of the audience who are interested in the topic become completely uninterested in the book itself because it’s not well-written. This book could have used a better edit and some more time spent on the actual language. (Believe it or not, it’s possible to strike a balance between boring and sensationalized.) I also thought it was childish to devote a whole section at the end of the book to a rebuttal to another book written with the same source material. Sure, that’s all well and good for an article in a journal, but as part of the book itself it just seemed more inflammatory and butthurt (excuse my less-than-scholarly language, but it’s true) than mature and well-reasoned.

20,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36603555-katherine-addison,Rating 3 out of 5,"There's a way in which reading this book, for me, forms a ring composition with Daniel Jonah Goldhagen's Hitler's Willing Executioners: Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust, because Goldhagen spends a great deal of time and energy passionately arguing with Browning.Now that I've read Ordinary Men, I can see why.But first I want to talk about what this book does well, because there are things it does very well indeed.Ordinary Men is about a reserve battalion of the Order Police (Ordnungspolizei) sent into Poland in 1941-43 to assist in the Final Solution. Mostly their duties consisted of rounding up Jews to be deported to Treblinka, Sobibor, and other extermination camps, but they were also directly involved in several massacres. In all, Browning puts the total body count for these roughly 500 German men at a minimum of 83,000 Jews; of those, at least 38,000 were Jews whom members of the battalion personally shot.Browning is very good at laying out the progress of Reserve Battalion 101 through their assigned area of Poland, at making a coherent historical narrative from the testimony of battalion members taken in the 1960s. He's very good at describing exactly what these men participated in, and very good at showing the persistence of the Nazis in their self-appointed task. Jews might escape from the initial deportation, but escaping once wasn't enough. One of Reserve Battalion 101's principal duties was the Judenjagd, the ""Jew Hunt"": going out into the countryside and the Polish forests, hunting down, and shooting every last hidden Jew. Browning describes these routine atrocities vividly.There are, however, problems. The first is a global judgment call about the testimonies of the members of Reserve Battalion 101: ""many of these testimonies had a 'feel' of candor and frankness conspicuously absent form the exculpatory, alibi-laden, and mendacious testimony so often encountered in such court records"" (Browning xvii). In other words, Browning has decided to believe that these men are telling the truth about everything. But as a reader, I found much of the quoted testimony to be exculpatory and alibi-laden, and I had grave doubts about the truthfulness of the men who claimed to have avoided killing Jews. They were giving this testimony in the 1960s, in the context of prosecutions for the genocidal crimes their battalion committed. Browning doesn't give any further evidence or explanation for this ""feel"" of candor and frankness, and without that evidence, without something other than Browning's claim to authoritative judgment, I don't understand why we should believe these claims of (even relative) innocence.A second problem, closely related: although Browning admits fully that the vast majority of Police Battalion 101 did not resist their orders to kill Jews, he spends most of his analysis focusing on the very small minority who did resist (or who claimed to have resisted). Thus the impression of his analysis of battalion member testimony--as opposed to the impression of his narrative account of the battalion's actions--is based on those who resisted killing Jews. Now there's nothing inherently wrong with that--if, for instance, this were a book about the resistance to the Final Solution among the Order Police. But it argues that it isn't. It claims to be a book about the participation of the Order Police in the Final Solution, and the impression Browning gives is that that participation was reluctant. But again, by his own account, for roughly 90% of Reserve Battalion 101, that was not the case. Browning focuses on those he finds sympathetic, those who tried, even minimally, to resist. This allows readers to enter a kind of empathic community: even if they failed, they tried. We can accept that they are like us.* And I think, in some measure, that's part of Browning's project: hence his aggressive insistence on the ""ordinariness"" of his subjects.) But it ducks the larger and uglier question: what about the 90%? They, too, are ""ordinary men."" Aren't they, too, ""like us""?The third problem is the one that Goldhagen was most incensed about, and I can understand why. Browning writes about the ideological pressures on these men as if the Nazis had invented anti-Semitism, describing ""years of anti-Semitic propaganda (and prior to the Nazi dictatorship, decades of shrill German nationalism)"" (186). Goldhagen goes into exhaustive detail to chronicle the endemic and virulent anti-Semitism in Germany before 1933. The Nazis didn't make that weapon; they just picked it up from where it was lying on the ground.The fourth problem is the one I actually find most disturbing. On several actions, Reserve Battalion 101 was assisted by ""Hiwis"" (Hilfswilligen), units of POWs from Ukraine, Latvia, and Lithuania ""who were screened on the basis of their anti-Communist (and hence almost invariably anti-Semitic) sentiments, offered an escape from probably starvation, and promised that they would not be used in combat against the Soviet army"" (52). Browning describes the drunkenness and cruelty of the Hiwis (from the testimony of the Germans); he never seems to consider that they, too, were ""ordinary men."" In a creepy way (and although he explicitly rejects this with regard to Poles), he accepts the Germans' evaluation of the Hiwis as untermenschen.Throughout this book, then, Browning constructs anti-Semitism as coming from ""outside""--either from above (the Nazi leadership, and we all know Hitler is both evil and crazy anyway) or below (the Hiwis and certain members of the battalion who are also tagged as drunkards and sadists). It is never inherent in the ""ordinary men"" who are his subjects.** This is a very comforting construct, and it greatly assists his project of claiming likeness between his ""ordinary"" subjects and his ""ordinary"" readers (not to exculpate his subjects, for Browning is in fact very clear about their crimes and their responsibility, but to encourage his readers to try to understand them instead of demonizing them), but it is untrue. And I think it leaves a critical gap in Browning's study, a critical aspect of the situation that he does not address and that therefore we cannot understand.---*Who is ""us,"" in this case? Ordinary Men is a book with a strongly implied audience. Without doing a formal analysis of its rhetoric, I still feel fairly certain of my ground in saying that that audience is normative American, i.e., sharing white professional-class values. The implied audience is not Jewish. Nor is it German. Nor is it working-class. It's a little harder to tell about the gender question, because by choosing to study a reserve police battalion, Browning had no choice but to study men. And in general, if you're studying Nazis, you're studying men. (One of the books on my list is about women in Nazi Germany, but fundamentally, everyone in a position of power in Hitler's Germany was male.) But there are some indications that the implied audience is made up of men, too.**This construct explains some of the very peculiar rhetorical and logical moves he makes, as for example:To admit an explicitly political or ideological dimension to their behavior, to concede that the morally inverted world of National Socialism--so at odds with the political culture and accepted norms of the 1960s--had made perfect sense to them at the time, would be to admit that they were political and moral eunuchs who simply accommodated to each successive regime. That was a truth with which few either wanted or were able to come to grips. (150)1. ""political and moral eunuchs""? This is possibly the bizarrest eruption of gender politics into an argument not about gender that I have ever seen.2. Where did ""truth"" come from? This is a hypothesis about motivation, nothing more, and it's kind of odd even as a hypothesis. A far more likely one is that, again, as they were testifying to prosecutors, nobody wanted to damn himself by admitting Nazi sympathies. Robert Jay Lifton (The Nazi Doctors: Medical Killing and the Psychology of Genocide) found in his interviews with Nazi doctors that most of them began by asserting compliance with current societal norms, but the longer he talked to them, the more their old Nazi beliefs would start to emerge.But Browning's argument makes sense if you assume that no one (who isn't either Hitler--evil and crazy!--or the untermenschen who are only barely human) can really believe in anti-Semitism. Hence the program of Goldhagen's book to insist that, yes, you could. Ordinary people (men and women) did."

There are almost no outside sources to corroborate or confirm the testimonies given by these policemen. The few eyewitnesses that existed had little to no direct contact with these policemen, unlike the survivors of ghettos, concentration camps, who knew their perpetrators very well. Because of this, Browning relies much too heavily on the battalion members’ own testimonies, which are often contradictory, untrustworthy, and confusing.  The testimonies here were part of an official investigation into war crimes by the German state prosecutor in Hamburg in the 1960s. It is so important to understand that, until the year 1973, thousands of high-level Nazis continued to serve as powerful judges and public prosecutors in post-war, allied-occupied Germany! Almost all of these cases were dropped. The lack of justice only demonstrates how heinous crimes of the holocaust continued to be denied, minimized, and dismissed as “only following orders” by Germany's judicial system decades after WWII. Read more about this here: https://www.businessinsider.com/forme...Browning places so much weight on peer pressure as the main motivation for these gruesome mass murders. He fails to understand how much anti-Jewish propaganda dehumanized and demonized, Jews. Browning claims that these men were not deeply anti-Semitic, simply because they themselves claim this while they were under criminal investigation. Yet, these same policemen lived in Nazi Germany under Hitler, Himmler, and Goebbel. Since this book was published, millions of Jewish Holocaust survivor testimonies have demonstrated over and over how their non-Jewish neighbors, people with whom they had friendly, warm relationships for generations, turned on them during the Holocaust. Browning doesn't make the case that peer pressure, not antisemitic ideology, turned thousands of ordinary family men into mass murders.

Based on testimony given in the 1960s the author draws out the way in which these men approached and dealt with the systematic murder of Jews in Poland.The police unit was formed from men unsuitable for the regular army, taken from one German city - Hamburg- and represented a cross section of society.It shows how the men were affected differently by this heinous crime - some became efficient and enthusiastic killers, some refused or avoided the tasks, but most went along with it. The mental toll from repeatedly shooting men, woman and children in the neck at point blank range was debilitating for many. We see a range of justifications for their acts, mainly to do with duty and not letting down comrades. What we do not see is admission of race hate, as the policemens testimony could have lead to serious punishment. The commander of the unit was hanged in Poland in 1947 (ironically for the murder of 86 poles not the 90,000 jews the unit directly or indirectly murdered)Browning cites post war academic studies which show that ""normal"" human beings are capable of great cruelty when placed in positions of power over others. He links this to the actions of police battalion 101, and details the race hate indoctrination prevalent at the time. Dehumanise jews, communists, gays and gypsies and it becomes easier to kill ""the other"".Where this book loses me is the final thirty or so pages, which is a polemic against another academic.

Thus, reflecting upon this book may help us choose the correct exit from the cavern, and to that end, it is worth bearing the unease that comes over us when we read books like this.This book, a staple of Holocaust studies for twenty-five years, has recently risen to fresh prominence due to repeated mentions of it by Canadian psychologist, and superstar, Jordan Peterson. His focus on the book arises from his own decades-long study of evil regimes, and his thought on how we, you and I, would really react if we lived under an actual such regime. Peterson’s basic point is that we are deluding ourselves if we think we would be heroes; the vast majority of us would fall somewhere on the scale of cooperation with evil. ""Ordinary Men"" shows that principle in application, in the history of a group of German men who saw militarized police service in Poland during World War II.Christopher Browning’s focus is on a “reserve police” (Ordnungspolizei) battalion, Number 101. This battalion consisted of roughly five hundred men and was composed mostly of working class men from Hamburg. Very few had any Nazi political background; most, to the extent they had political views, were probably Social Democrats. They were not soldiers; they were nationalized paramilitary police, of a type not found in America, but common in Europe, then and now. Basically, they were a combination of police force and National Guardsmen; not eligible, for the most part, for regular military service, due to age or some other reason, but frequently used to support operations in areas where the German military had conquered.What was special about this battalion was not its composition, or its actions, which were roughly the same as several similar battalions. Rather, it’s that we can know a lot of what these men actually did, which is not the case for most such units, lost among the fog of war and the desire to conceal the past. In the 1960s the German authorities conducted and transcribed, as part of a criminal investigation, extensive interviews with all the surviving Battalion 101 members they could find. Apparently this was one of the few battalions whose membership list was extant at that time, hence the focus on this battalion. It was these court records to which Browning, in the late 1980s, was able to gain access (though he was forbidden from revealing actual names except for those few men actually convicted of crimes, so he uses pseudonyms throughout), and which he used to construct what is part history and part psychological analysis. In more recent years additional such data has been mined and published, but Browning was the first to conduct a study of this type. He is very cautious in his approach, noting that no individual’s testimony can be taken at face value, but claiming, I think accurately, that by judicious and open-minded examination of the mass of testimony, triangulating claims against each other and against known history, a great deal can be determined with a high degree of certainty.The relevant area here is Poland in 1941 and 1942. Reserve Battalion 101 did not operate in Russia, but other similar battalions did, participating after Hitler’s invasion in 1941 in the rounding up, and increasingly frequent organized murder, of Jews in locations like Minsk. Many such battalions ended up pressed into frontline fighting, though, and the Germans fairly quickly transferred killing duties to locally recruited elements, who were for the most part only too happy to help out, unlike, as we will see, some of the reserve battalion’s policemen. Battalion 101, however, continued its behind-the-lines focus throughout the war, never serving as a fighting military unit.Beginning in 1940, Battalion 101 was used to resettle Poles (mostly not Jews) in Western Poland, around Łódź. This was deportation, but not killing or transport to death camps (which did not exist in 1940). At the end of 1940, the battalion took up guard duties at the Łódź ghetto, into which the 160,000 Jews of Łódź had been crammed. Again, this did not involve killing, though it involved mistreatment and dehumanization of Jews, if not by the battalion’s own men, then by other Nazis involved in guard duties. In mid-1941, the battalion returned to Hamburg and was functionally dissolved and re-formed; it these mostly newly enrolled men on whom Browning’s book focuses.Battalion 101’s direct involvement in massacres began in July 1942, as the Final Solution got into full swing. The first massacre was in the Polish village of Józefów, where the battalion was ordered to collect the roughly 1,800 Jews living there; to shoot women, children and old people on the spot, and ship out male Jews suitable for slave labor to Lublin. The battalion’s commandant, Major Wilhelm Trapp, gave a speech to the men in which he expressed some distress and said that men would not be punished for asking for guard or transport duty. A handful took advantage of the offer; the rest, in a highly disorganized, ad hoc, fashion, trucked Jews from the town, marched them into the nearby woods, and chaotically shot them in batches at point-blank range. (Here, and throughout the book, the fate of children is somewhat opaque—they must have been killed, but nobody, even Browning, seems to really want to talk about the details.) During the killing, some more, maybe ten percent to twenty percent, of the battalion’s men made themselves scarce, either by hiding or simply moving about with apparent purpose, but taking advantage of the confusion to not participate directly in the killing. Most of the men, however, participated to the end; when they returned to barracks, many were shaken, and alcohol was provided, but there was no collective pushback against what they had done.In August, Battalion 101 assisted in collecting Jews from various villages, for transportation to Treblinka, collecting them and packing them into the infamous cattle cars. Many Jews were shot during these operations, but killing Jews wasn’t the immediate goal, and local auxiliary forces (so-called Hiwis) did most of the actual killing. Then, in the fall, the battalion was directly involved in several more mass shootings ordered from above. (Who did the ordering is lost to history, as with so many things in war, and the Germans who organized the Final Solution were keen to avoid records, not so much for fear of punishment in this life, but because they thought the masses of Germans should not know what had been done.) These later shootings were more organized, since techniques had been learned and practiced, and, more importantly, men within the battalion had risen to positions of authority who either did not mind directing such work, or positively enjoyed it.The mass of men in the battalion had gotten used to carrying out their orders. Those who objected, of whom Browning profiles several, and who may have been as many as ten percent of the total, were the target of strong social pressure but were not punished, and the most vociferous objectors were ultimately transferred back to units based in Germany. More shootings and deportation followed, along with “Jew hunts” for those who had gone into hiding or become, or joined, partisans. The final killing in which the battalion participated was the massive killing in the fall of 1943, the “Harvest Festival” massacres, in which Heinrich Himmler ordered the coordinated extermination of the Jews in Lublin work camps. (While Browning does not mention it, the man in charge of “Harvest Festival,” Christian Wirth, was instrumental in the Aktion T4 program, the Nazi killing of the handicapped that preceded and smoothed the path for the Holocaust.) “For a battalion of less than 500 men, the ultimate body count was at least 83,000 Jews.”Reading all this is exhausting, even in a fairly short book. The usual disturbing details, hard to understand, crop up, such as that Jews went to their deaths with “quiet composure.” Browning humanizes, or at least reifies, the men of the battalion, drawing incisive sketches of them, as known through the interviews to which he had access. Generally, those few who did not participate, or limited their participation, were usually of a slightly higher social class than the other men. Several were tradesmen who had their own businesses and were not interested in a postwar police career, and so were more independent. Roman Catholics seemed to be the most likely to refuse—but there were few in Hamburg, so this was not a large group, either. But, as one would expect, no one factor dictated a man’s behavior. Or rather, one single factor hard to define did—his character.So why did “ordinary men” men become killers of innocents? Browning goes through each possibility. The first is conformity, “the basic identification of the men in uniform with their comrades and the strong urge not to separate themselves from the group by stepping out.” In essence, this is peer pressure. The second is a desire and compulsion to obey authority from above, reinforced by the “legitimizing capacities of government,” a strong element in the German mindset. The third is the men’s belief that they had no choice, that punishment for themselves or their families would follow a refusal to obey orders. As Browning notes, though, there is no example known in all the war of a single incident of a soldier being punished for refusal to murder civilians, much less any repercussions for his family, although that’s not to say threats were not made. Punishment of uninvolved family members for political offenses was, and is, a Left/Communist specialty, not used to any relevant degree by the Nazis. The fourth is anti-Semitism, conditioned by years of Nazi propaganda (or, perhaps, as discussed below, by the German social culture and pysche itself, not merely by Nazism). The fifth, beyond mere anti-Semitism, is aggressive indoctrination, creating the active principle of eliminationism of which intellectual anti-Semitism was the passive precursor. But, as Browning notes, these men were not political Nazis, for the most part, and relative to, for example, the SS, they received cursory indoctrination, in which at most a dislike for Jews was inculcated, not a desire to kill Jews.Browning seems to think that of these five, conformity was the key element, but that any individual man’s behavior cannot be isolated to one simple explanation. He points to the Stanford prison experiment as evidence that average men can quickly become cruel and treat others in dehumanizing ways, which is certainly true, as shown by this book, although it turns out that the actual Stanford experiment was pretty much a fraud, and not replicable to boot. Browning also adduces Stanley Milgram’s famous experiment with test subjects giving electric shocks to people at the command of an authority figure, noting the effect both of authority and peer pressure/conformity (although that experiment has also been criticized as far removed from the real world). My opinion is that pointing to these experiments isn’t particularly helpful to the reader; the mere recitation of the facts, combined with the (presumably far less traumatic) experiences of each of us, should be enough to show that conformity, by itself or combined with other factors, is itself enough to create murderers, for all men are fallen, and Order Police Battalion 101 is just another example in an endless litany. Each of us can be Cain.The only explanation that Browning rejects outright is that the actions of Battalion 101, and of all those who killed Jews in the Holocaust, were the result of some uniquely evil strain in the German psyche, springing from centuries of anti-Semitism as the core defining element of German culture. And there lies the post-publication history of this book. Browning’s core point is that these were ordinary men, not ordinary German men, and that to focus on their being German makes us feel that the Holocaust is unique, and therefore can be ignored as not having real lessons for the future, since the Germans appear to have left anti-Semitism behind. When this book came out, in 1992, it was widely acclaimed. In 1996, though, Daniel Goldhagen (known for his book ""Hitler’s Willing Executioners,"" a 1998 expansion on his arguments with Browning) attacked ""Ordinary Men,"" claiming that Browning had this analysis exactly wrong, and the problem was the Germans themselves, each and every one.I am hardly a Holocaust studies expert, but my understanding is that a basic divide is between “functionalists,” like Browning, and “intentionalists.” As the names suggest, the functionalists see the Holocaust as not being specifically planned and not being the necessary consequence of German sociology or even Nazi ideology, but something that organically developed as an intersection of ideology and events. In another universe, the Germans won the war quickly, and most Jews were not killed, but perhaps deported to Madagascar or Africa. Hitler probably never directly ordered the Holocaust and did not plan it; he stated the need for the “Final Solution” (which Browning believes was, until 1941, conceived of purely as a geographic relocation solution), and the well-known principle of “moving toward the Führer,” combined with the anarchy and internal competition of the Nazi state, along with circumstance, did the rest. The intentionalists, in opposition, see the Holocaust as the precise and deliberate culmination of a twenty-year plan. Lacking documentary evidence for this, they tend to focus, like Goldhagen, on the idea that the Germans uniformly lusted to kill Jews, as a result of German social psychology. Hitler just gave them permission to do what they all wanted to do all along.I knew none of this until I read this book, and came upon the Afterword, published in 1998 by Browning to respond to Goldhagen’s attack on him. Browning scathingly dismisses Goldhagen, in terms quite aggressive for an academic dispute. He distinguishes between German “xenophobic” anti-Semitism, common enough but not supremely important in the culture, and the much rarer “chimeric” or “redemptive” anti-Semitism found in true ideologues, such as Himmler, and a “fringe phenomenon” until 1933. He points out that if Goldhagen’s thesis is true, and the Germans were not indoctrinated into anti-Semitism by the Nazis, how were they so easily indoctrinated out of anti-Semitism after the war? He notes many other mass killings of equal viciousness, from Yugoslavia in the war, to Mao to Stalin, to Cambodia, to Rwanda. He accuses Goldhagen of bad history on many fronts, including the idea that anti-Semitism was more important to most Germans as a threat than Social Democracy or the Triple Entente. He notes that the Nazis were more than happy to kill many others besides Jews, especially Russians and Poles. He rips Goldhagen for bias, cherry picking his data and terrible social science methodology. The cumulative effect, though I have not read Goldhagen myself, is pretty devastating.In any case, Browning is correct that the behavior of Reserve Police Battalion 101 is not unique. It is, as Peterson says, what all of us could become—perhaps some of us might be the non-conformist, retroactively, in the right circumstances, baptized as heroes. But probably not. And that implies that if ideological mass, mechanized killing returns to the West, it will find little difficulty implementing the desires of ideologues.We on the Right tend to see this as a threat always over the horizon when the Left dominates, and that is true enough as a historical matter—the vast majority of such twentieth-century ideological killing was conducted by the Left, in an attempt to reach the Utopia that justified sacrifice, or at least the sacrifice of others. And yes, most significant killing by the Right in the twentieth century (leaving aside the Nazis, who had a great deal of leftist ancestry), was measured and usually proportionate, the result of civil war and the need to eliminate direct and existential threats, as in Chile, for example. But the Right should not be complacent—the same demonic, chthonic drives that spur on the Left recur, in their own fashion, in the Right, if less often. We easily forget the Ustasha in Croatia, for example, and, again, the line between good and evil runs through every human heart.The Right must reckon with the truth that, in any future ideological hot conflict with the Left in America, towards which the Left is pushing hard, it would be easy for ordinary men to once again descend into eliminationism—particularly if the Right becomes informed by its own utopian ideology, rather than by the simple desire to break the current power of the Left and return society to basic virtue and the opportunity for human flourishing. Ideology, especially utopian ideology, is not only seductive and gives apparent meaning and simplicity; it is also an effective way to organize people and power. Merely offering a better life not crushed by the Left does not move men’s souls in the same way. Very few will die on the barricades for Russell Kirk. We see stirrings of a Right ideological movement, attractive as always to aimless young men, in groups like Gavin McInnes’s Proud Boys. It’s amusing to see the evil and terroristic Antifa get beat up, as they deserve, but it’s not a good sign for the future. Writ large, ultimately such movements, or rather their successors, can lead to the same type of behavior that Browning expertly narrates. Thus, reading this book, and listening to people like Jordan Peterson, may serve as a form of inoculation against such a dystopian future. All young men should be required to read it. For some, like Antifa, it will be taken as a how-to guide, but for others, it may dampen the wars to come."

And what can happen at any time to any group of people. Even today. It's an essential read.I found out about Ordinary Men from Jordan Peterson around the time 12 Rules came out. I think he mentioned it repeatedly in a few interviews and it immediately jumped to my TBR though I got to it only now, years later.It's a relatively short book, with 220 pages of text it's quick read but a tough one. I've been to Auschwitz, to Sereď where Slovak Jews and others were being deported from and I saw like a dozen documentaries about concentration camps alone. I feel like these executions that were happening before and simultaneously to deportations are being largely ignored by the mainstream. And the numbers are staggering. The scale, the efficiency. It was hard to get through some of the chapters. I don't consider myself a history buff but I do dare to say I know more about WWII than average person. But this was a blind spot to me, it seems. I knew about executions of Russian POWs and citizens in the conquered territories which the book touches only briefly but I had no idea it was on such scale and done by average people, not sadistic SS soldiers. Doubly so for the main content in this book, public executions of Jews in Poland. Thousands per day. It wasn't 20 people in this town, 30 there in a span of the entire occupation (assuming the rest was deported to camps). No, they were brought to one spot and executed, one group after another, executions going on entire day. Not even ISIS was this efficient and methodical.And the most depressing thing is that there was zero justice. These people weren't punished. The handful (literally could count them on fingers of one hand) were imprisoned for a few years towards the end of their lives. That's it. No rope. Unbelievable."

It is imperative that this book be re-written as the information is a critical lesson to humanity and modern societies - the Holocaust was not a unique event in humanity's history. To think it can never happen again in a modern society is hubris of the worst kind. Everyone needs to be aware of not only what happened during the Holocaust, but more importantly why and how it happened - the subject of this book albeit focusing on the study of the Reserve Police Battalions and not the entire nation state. Conflating an answer of how this could happen to ""the evil Nazis"" is demonstrating an ignorance which will not prevent a re-occurrence of this horror.The book is written as a scholarly study and argument. If as the reader you are not familiar with the role of the Order Police and of the Jewish population control and clearing actions in Poland some of what is written will seem while reading the primary chapters as if the author is drawing conclusions with minimal information and then using those conclusions as fact to draw even larger conclusions. I'm assuming this is because the author assumes the reader may know more than is the case. In a re-write I would place much of the information contained in Ch 17 Germans, Poles and Jews at the beginning. This chapter provides context and provides insight into the interactions between the three groups as derived from source material. Ch 18 Ordinary Men describes the challenges of using the existing documentation - primarily the interview notes by the German prosecutors - to understand what really happened. This chapter is critical to understand some of the minor conclusions that are drawn in earlier chapters. Finally the Afterward and the section titled Twenty-five Years Later need to be incorporated into the story if as a non-historian you have any chance of trying to understand why ordinary Germans could ever carry out these atrocities.Poignant and important to understand as societies undergo the stress of change.

30,no user info,Rating 2 out of 5,"I had to read this for a class otherwise I probably wouldn't have picked it up. Holocaust lit is depressing enough and this had its share of horrific tales but it didn't seem to be more than an elongated account on one battalion. It was missing more. Browning starts off with this claim that he is going to analyze and explain why 'ordinary men' become killers and I feel he really failed to do that. Towards the end, he explains several factors that helped many of the men get to that point (wanting promotions, dehumanization, peer pressure) but he still fails to give a real, true reason, which leads me to believe there really isn't one. The Holocaust happened because people are horrible and capable of horrific things. We would like to think that we all have the conscience and willpower to stand up against things like this but from the Holocaust, it seems like that was a small minority. The Afterword was pretty much a personal vendetta back-and-forth going on between Browning and another guy. (Goldhagen? I don't remember his name.) Due to Browning's lack of a real reason, I would tend to agree with other guy's point even though I haven't read it. The Holocaust seems to be a case of 'willing executioners'. However, I can definitely see some of the flaws in other guy's argument that would arise if he is using evidence how Browning claims. You can't just ignore what doesn't fit your hypothesis and pick and choose pieces of quotes to make them fit your side of the story. I would have been interested to read other guy's account and get both sides of the story, but if Browning's claims about his evidenciary use can be believed, I'm a bit afraid to be dragged into something I know is largely faked. In summation, (lol) we have other books to read for this class so I'll just stick to those for the time being. "

38,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2752754-claudia-moscovici,Rating 5 out of 5,"The true banality of evil: Review of Ordinary Men by Christopher R. Browning Hannah Arendt referred to Adolf Eichmann as the paradigm of the banality of evil: an ordinary man led by extraordinary circumstances to exceptional evil. However, given that Eichmann spearheaded some of the key initiatives of the murder of 6 million Jews during the Holocaust, I have argued that he was quite extraordinary: extraordinarily sociopathic and evil. The circumstances of Fascist Germany allowed his true nature to be revealed and his thirst for power through murder to be played out. In Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland (New York: Harper Perennial, 1993) historian Christopher R. Browning reveals the true nature of the banality of evil by recounting the transformation of members of the Order Police, the Police Battalion 101, from regular men to brutal killers. Although initially the Order Police was composed of young men sympathetic to Nazi principles, by the late 1930’s it included older men from all walks of life: policemen, workers, small businessmen. Browning notes that these Order Police units expanded during the war: “Twenty-one police battalions of approximately 500 men each were formed from the various police companies and training units in Germany, thirteen of them were attached to the armies invading Poland” (6). While one can plausibly argue that the SS were chosen for their anti-Semitic outlook and brutality, that’s not the case of the Reserve Police Battalion 101. Yet this unit of five hundred “ordinary men” is responsible for the murder of 38,000 Jews and the deportation of an additional 45,200 in occupied Poland in 1942. Few of the perpetrators were tried for their crimes against humanity after the war. For those who did face a trial, their main defense was similar to Eichmann’s: namely, that they were merely following the orders of their superiors. In their case, unlike in Eichmann’s, this defense sounded plausible. Few of these men were ardent Nazis. Even fewer had violent or sadistic tendencies. Most of them were middle-aged men who were found ineligible for military duty. They were sent to Poland to participate in Operation Reinhard, which included shooting en masse the Jews of entire small towns, such as Jozefow and Lomazy. They did so voluntarily, although initially not eagerly. Most of these men hesitated to kill women and children in the beginning. Browning points out that, contrary to the later excuse they offered that they were merely following orders, those orders didn’t entail any serious negative consequences for those who refused to follow them. The commander of Unit 101 gave his soldiers the option of opting out of conducting mass murders if they did not have the “fortitude” to kill civilians. All they faced, at worst, was peer pressure from some of their more ruthless colleagues. And yet, Browning notes, remarkably, only 12 out of the 500 men in Reserve Police Battalion 101 opted not to shoot innocent people. Seeing themselves as merely doing their duty, they rounded up and shot thousands of helpless civilians. As they got used to their “job”, they became more violent and sadistic. Some even smashed Jewish babies against the wall, or threw them up into the air and shot them. The rest became increasingly used to the mass murders, quickening the pace of slaughter and increasing the brutality as time went on. If any book can show that genocide can happen anywhere and be perpetrated by regular human beings placed in extraordinary circumstances, Browning’s well-researched and persuasive book is it.

Not the antisemitic ravings of Hitler, or the careerist banality of Eichmann, but the physical labor of liquidating the Jews of Poland. Someone had to round up the Jews in ghettos, herd them onto trains to the death camps, shoot the ones who couldn't walk or evaded. Ordinary Men asks what happens to the people who perpetuate a genocide.The 'someone' in Ordinary Men were the men of Reserve Police Battalion 101, about 500 middle-aged, working-class men from Hamburg. Most of them had ambitions in local policing, writing traffic tickets, dealing with drunks, and other very ordinary policework. About a quarter were Nazi party members. And while deployed away from home, Poland in 1942 was hardly facing Zhukov's armored shock armies on the Eastern Front. At the start of 1942, they were not by any standards, killers.That would change. The first massacre was at Józefów in July 1942. It was a fiasco. The Jews of the town were marched into the woods, paired up with Nazis from the 101, and executed with shots to the neck. The men did poorly. Offered a chance to refuse, a handful did. Others dodged behind trucks or otherwise out of sight of NCOs. Major Trapp, the commander, apparently broke down weeping. Blooded, the 101 became a group of hardened killers. The methods became more efficient, more impersonal, the worst tasks handed over to the death camps or local HiWi volunteers, who tried to out-Nazi the Nazis. A handful of men were truly enthusiastic, delighting in the sadism of the exercise. Another handful evaded. Most concluded it was a dirty job, but that someone had to do it, and the military virtue of 'toughness' meant it was them. None resisted. By the time the unit left Poland for Russia 18 months later, they had been party to something like 80,000 murders.The point is not that Reserve Police Battalion 101 was made of monsters. The point is that if they could commit a genocide, so could almost anyone, given only a few minor tweaks to an authoritarian and racist worldview that is not terribly far out of the mainstream today. Decide that the tough thing to do, the necessary thing to do as a group, is to shoot a defenseless human being in a shallow grave, and ordinary men will do it, and do it gladly.Oh, and what happened to the men of Reserve Police Battalion 101? Many died on the Eastern Front, as safe Jew hunts became something more like actual combat. Major Trapp and another officer were deported to Poland in 1946 and executed. And the survivors of the unit were tried in an unusually honest and thorough investigation in the 1960s, which saw five men out of over 120 imprisoned for sentences under 10 years. The rest of these ordinary men went on to lead ordinary lives, many of them collecting police pensions in Hamburg."

Others who did not take part accepted the stigma of weakness and unmanliness, thereby validating the ethic of toughness of their comrades. Virtually no one dared show solidarity with the victims, reproach their comrades, or criticize the regime, though one could complain about the ""dirty business"" that the unit had been assigned. Good points - Most people aren't good, they are just ordinary people. Under the right condition they could commit the most horrified crime that normally they could never imagine. That means many cruel criminals are not naturally different with us. - Some people were really strong survivors. Even they had been shot and buried, some of them can still crawled out of the grave => They are human and I am human, it is possible that I am also very strong. - 10 men can guard 8,000 Jews with rifles and guns from 1940s (not very efficient at killing people like now). I can't help but thinking there might be a psychological factors at work. What put those poor victims in line? Perhaps it's right that  fear cuts deeper than knife ! Or maybe their dim hope led them to mortality?(quote)...Like much else, killing was something one could get used to   - Some of the policemen had made a choice to withdraw from the killing mission but most of them didn't. The choice had been hidden until someone asked => There might always be a different plan than what I deem the only one. - When the leader is corrupted, many followers will also be. - It's easier to induce killing if you can distance the killers with their victims.(quote) The Holocaust, after all, is a story with far too few heroes and all too many perpetrators and victims. (quote) Evil that arises out of ordinary thinking is committed by ordinary people is the norm, not the exception  - Most people can't be propagandistically shaped after the age of 27 to 30 - People tends to resolve actions and belief by rationalization or devising justification especially when they are in a situation that's hard to modify their course of actions. Drawbacks It caused me a fair headache while reading this book although I didn't feel that my emotions were stirred up."

He used these to explain how ""ordinary men"" could commit the crimes of the holocaust and what made those men different from us. The disheartening answer is nothing made them different, they're just like us. About 20% of the members took no or little part in the killing, about 20% were glad to take part, and the remaining 60% just went along. A very interesting and informative book and one that I highly recommend.[return][return]One interesting thing was Browning's inclusion of an afterward in the paperback edition which responded to the publication of Hitler's Willing Executioners: Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust by Daniel Goldhagen. Goldhagen's book drew in large part from the same records Browning used but came to vastly different conclusions. Browning used the afterward to refute Goldhagen's conclusions, as well as to defend accusations made against his research by Goldhagen. Goldhagen concluded that ordinary Germans took part in the holocaust because they had historically hated Jews (obviously an oversimplification of his argument). As an aside, I had a military history professor who said that Goldhagen's book proved that even in academia crap can get published."
42,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26600120-joshua,Rating 3 out of 5,"Generally viewed as an essential entry in the holocaust record, Browning's book is a grim and downright chilling account of how ordinary men became willing participants in Hitler's Final Solution. Given the content, it would be hard to say that I ""enjoyed"" Ordinary Men, but I am glad I read it. It's important to be reminded of what people are capable of when subjected to peer pressure, a steady stream of dehumanizing propaganda, and horrific orders from authority figures. This book's strength is the historical analysis and examination of personal accounts of Police Battalion 101 members. In my (unpopular) opinion, its weakness is Browning's amateur psychoanalysis of the Final Solution's ""ordinary men."" With no empirical data or applicable generalizable studies, Browning's examination of the possible psychological explanations for Battalion 101 is interesting but ultimately pure speculation. "

The argument makes more sense, and the evidence is presented in a much more coherent manner. But I can't really recommend that anyone read this unless you are devoted to studying the Holocaust. It is so awful and grim. It makes one weep for humanity. Really, it is tough to read about war crimes all day. I started to have nightmares about halfway through the book. The sad thing is, it is probably important for humanity to be forced to face head-on the issues raised by this book. It is important to realize that the Germans during WWII were not some special kind of evil sort of people, but rather ordinary people who show that it isn't all that hard to turn ordinary people into murderers. But facing this stuff is so depressing. "

45,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27408352-the-sporty-bookworm,Rating 4 out of 5,"Livre culte sur la Seconde guerre mondiale dans lequel Christophe R.Browning étudie via des archives les agissements du 101e bataillon de la réserve de la police allemande. Ce bataillon a oeuvré à la solution finale de manière active en participant aux fusillades de masse tout autant qu'aux déportations. Or ce n'était pas un bataillon de SS pur et dur mais de simples policiers réservistes qui ont commis les pires crimes de l'histoire en tuant des dizaines de milliers de juifs, principalement des femmes, des enfants et des vieillards. Christophe R.Browning a étudié les dépositions et interrogatoires des anciens du 101e bataillon pour essayer de comprendre comment des personnes lambdas deviennent des génocidaires.Voici donc ses conclusions :80% du bataillon ont tué des juifs de manière régulière. Parmi ceux-là, beaucoup ont été sensibles au lavage de cerveau idéologique des années précédentes. Après la première guerre mondiale, les réparations et la crise de 1929, les juifs étaient un bouc émissaire comme un autre pour un pays en crise. La supériorité de la race allemande était exacerbée et les juifs étaient désignés comme les responsables des malheurs du pays. Donc les hommes du 101e bataillon étaient déjà conditionnés à détester les juifs. Lors des premières tueries, le respect de l'autorité et de la hiérarchie ont également joué un rôle. Les ordres venaient d'en haut, il fallait bien que quelqu'un les exécute. (voir expérience de Milgram). Une autre explication est le conformisme. Quand tout le bataillon commence à fusiller des juifs, il est difficile pour un individu de refuser par peur de se faire traiter de ""lâche"" ou de ""mauviette"" laissant le sale boulot aux autres. Pour certains d'entre eux qui avaient peu d'éducation, un métier avec peu de débouchés voire pas de métier, la police en tant que réserviste était un moyen de faire carrière. Refuser de tuer des juifs aurait mis leur carrière en jeu. Ils s'acquittaient de leur tâche, bon gré mal gré comme une étape désagréable à passer. D'autres tuaient des juifs dans la police par peur d'aller au front. Les unités de police derrière les lignes avaient des conditions de vie acceptables : des repas chaque jour, de l'alcool et pas de Russes en face d'eux. Le meurtre de masse était un moindre mal que la guerre à l'est.19% ont tué des juifs mais étaient considérés comme faibles pour plusieurs raisons. Certains étaient nerveux et rataient leur cible. D'autres pleuraient ou vomissaient. Certains se mettaient à boire et bâclaient le travail. Il y avait des dépressions, des tire-aux-flancs et des hommes qui évitaient d'être là. Ils n'ont pas été des tueurs efficaces par choix mais parce qu'ils étaient incapables. Le comportement de ces éléments fut un déclencheur des chambres à gaz, méthode vue comme plus efficace et moins éprouvante pour l'humeur des soldats.Enfin, une infime minorité refusa de tuer (1%). Ceux-ci ne voulaient pas être mêlés à cela, une basse tâche. Ce n'était pas digne d'eux. Ils refusaient de participer car pour eux, une carrière dans la police avait peu d'intérêt. Certains avaient une entreprise florissante en Allemagne et donc aucun intérêt financier à rester dans la police. Ainsi un officier ne prit par à aucune tuerie car au pire il serait radié et rentrerait chez lui. (On voit là encore une injustice due aux inégalités. Un riche pouvait se permettre de faire fi des ordres qui ne lui plaisaient pas car il gagne plus dans le civil que dans la police réserviste. Un ancien ouvrier, un ancien artisan ou un chômeur considérait la police comme une opportunité de sortir de sa classe sociale et donc était peu enclin à ne pas appliquer les ordres de la hiérarchie)C'est un livre intéressant et instructif pour quiconque cherche à comprendre les mécanismes des génocides. On se demande en le lisant ce qui aurait pu arriver si on avait vécu cette période, si on avait été Allemand à cette période précise après une défaite miliaire, un matraquage idéologique de plusieurs années et recevant des ordres de nos supérieurs hiérarchiques avec qui on vivait au quotidien mais qui se trouvaient embarrassés et honteux de donner de tels ordres. 99% du bataillon ont tués de juifs (femmes, nourrissons et vieillards), aurais je fait partie des 1% ? En lisant ce livre, en tout cas, on comprend les mécanismes qui ont influencé ses hommes et ainsi espérons nous permet de faire en sorte de prendre les bonnes décisions si cela arrive à nouveau ici."

Nach einer ausführlichen (und für sich schon lesenswerten) Schilderung der brutalen Aktionen des Polizeibataillons 101 im Holocaust setzt sich der Autor mit der Frage auseinander, wieso sich ""ganz normale Männer"" am größten Völkermord der Geschichte beteiligt haben. Er wählt dabei einen multikausalen Ansatz und erklärt die Tätermotivation nicht nur durch kulturelle Bedingungen, sondern geht auch auf sozialpsychologische Erkenntnisse zu den Themen Rollenanpassung, Konformität, Gehorsam, Verhältnis von Einstellungen und Verhalten, Einfluss von Persönlichkeit vs. Situation auf das Verhalten, etc. ein. Außerdem zeigt er, wie sich diese situationsspezifischen Aspekte im Krieg auswirken und mit der nationalsozialistischen Ideologie (Idee von ""Volksgemeinschaft"", Kameradschaft etc.) eng verzahnt sind. Dabei bezieht er nicht nur eigene Forschung ein, sondern (v. a. am Ende des Buches) auch die anderer Historiker und Sozialpsychologen, wodurch seine inhaltliche Botschaft meiner Meinung nach nochmals an Überzeugungskraft gewinnt.Für mich war das Buch vor allem eine eindrucksvolle Veranschaulichung dafür, wie stark bestimmte situative Faktoren das Verhalten eines Menschen prägen können, bis hin zum Massenmord. Dies nimmt den Tätern jedoch nicht die individuelle Verantwortung - denn auch im Polizeibataillon 101 gab es eine nennenswerte Minderheit von Polizisten, die sich komplett oder weitgehend aus den Gewalttaten ihrer Einheit heraushalten konnten. Deshalb hat mir das Buch gezeigt, wie groß der Einfluss von Gruppenprozessen auf eigene Einstellungen und Verhaltensweisen ist, mich aber auch daran erinnert, dass der Mensch stets selber die Möglichkeit hat, selber seine Reaktion auf die äußeren Umstände zu wählen."

His final chapter and afterword -- in which he responds to Daniel Jonah Goldhagen's attacks on his scholarship -- are superb. These two chapters alone are worth the read.In my view, Browning's multi-layered, multi-causal interpretation of German history and the Holocaust is more persuasive and supported by the evidence than is Goldhagen's, whose book 'Hitler's Willing Executioners' is emotionally powerful but deeply flawed."
48,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2190636-joselito-honestly-and-brilliantly,Rating 5 out of 5,"Reserve Police Battalion 101 (RPB 101) was a unit in the German Order Police which operated in Poland during world war two. Its sole purpose was to empty Polish towns of Jews. First by rounding them up (immediately killing the complainers and the sick who can’t march), then taking them to the place of slaughter, then shooting them often after they’ve dug their own graves. They also track down Jews who had momentarily succeeded in hiding then kill them in the same way, sometimes right there where they found them.The gravity of their crimes is shocking enough, but what adds to the horror is the fact that this RPB 101 is not composed of hardened criminals from German prisons, or sociopaths picked from German mental asylums, or trained soldiers desensitized by drugs, but ordinary Germans. Sort of those you see around your neighbourhood, like perhaps your uncle who likes to play chess, your neighbour who is an accountant, or your playmate’s father who sings in a church choir.RPB 101 was headed by a policeman, Major Wilhelm Trapp, 53, who was a world war one veteran and a recipient of the Iron Cross First Class. It was his first battalion command. He had officers under him with more or less the same humdrum backgrounds: a forwarding agent, an owner of a family lumber business, a tea importer, a salesman and a few policemen like him. Of the rank and file:“the vast majority were from the Hamburg area. About 63 percent were of working-class background, but few were skilled laborers. The majority of them held typical Hamburg working-class jobs: dock workers and truck drivers were most numerous, but there were also many warehouse and construction workers, machine operators, seamen, and waiters. About 35 percent were lower-middle-class, virtually all of them white-collar workers. Three-quarters were in sales of some sort; the other one-quarter performed various office jobs, in both the government and private sector. The number of independent artisans and small businessmen was very small. Only a handful (2 percent) were middle-class professionals, and very modest ones at that, such as druggists and teachers. The average age of the men was 39; over half were between 37 and 42, a group considered too old for the army but most heavily conscripted for reserve police duty after September 1939.”So why did they do it? They were in the military, their country was at war, and they were given orders. How were they able to stomach what they were ordered to do? Initially, until they got used to it, they acted in great distress. After all, they were systematically executing not only a helpless and a largely unresisting group of innocent human beings (some of them even Germans, German Jews), but among these victims were old people, the sick, women, children and even infants in their mothers’ arms.Before their very first killing mission Major Trapp told his men of what they were tasked to do and had asked them that those who feel they could not participate in it are free to desist. A few begged off. Some stayed because allegedly they did not hear or understand what Trapp said. But a majority stayed out of a sense of duty and/or for fear that they might be branded as cowards by their fellow soldiers. Others rationalized that the Jews would not be able to escape their fate anyway so it would make no difference if they die in their hands or in the hands of other German soldiers.Trap stayed away from the place of mass execution during their first mission allegedly because he could not bear the sight:“Indeed, Trapp’s distress was a secret to no one. At the marketplace one policeman remembered hearing Trapp say, ‘Oh, God, why did I have to be given these orders,’ as he put his hand on his heart. Another policeman witnessed him at the schoolhouse. ‘Today I can still see exactly before my eyes Major Trapp there in the room pacing back and forth with his hands behind his back. He made a downcast impression and spoke to me. He said something like, ‘Man,…such jobs don’t suit me. But orders are orders.’ Another man remembered vividly howTrapp, ‘finally alone in our room, sat on a stool and wept bitterly. The tears really flowed.’ Another also witnessed Trapp at his headquarters. ‘Major Trapp ran around excitedly and then suddenly stopped dead in front of me, stared, and asked if I agreed with this. I looked him straight in the eye and said, ‘No, Herr Major!’ He then began to run around again and wept like a child. The doctor’s aide encountered Trapp weeping on the path from the marketplace to the forest and asked if he could help. ‘He answered me only to the effect that everything was very terrible.’ Concerning Jozefow, Trapp later confided to his driver, ‘If this Jewish business is ever avenged on earth, then have mercy on us Germans.’”But distressed or not, they nevertheless went on killing. Those they did not kill, they sent to Treblinka where they were gassed. Some confessed actually avoiding shooting children and infants, but one of them, a 35-year-old metalworker from Bremerhaven, declared during his trial after Germany’s defeat that:“I made the effort, and it was possible for me, to shoot only children. It so happened that the mothers led the children by the hand. My neighbor then shot the mother and I shot the child that belonged to her, because I reasoned with myself that after all without its mother the child could not live any longer. It was supposed to be, so to speak, soothing to my conscience to release children unable to live without their mothers.”The German word for “release” is ERLOSEN which means to “redeem” or “save” when used in the religious sense. So one who “releases” is the ERLOSER—the Saviour or Redeemer. He made it sound like killing those children was an act of mercy.RPB 101 was just one of the many mobile killing units the Nazis had during the war. It, alone, had shot to death about 38,000 Jews; and was responsible to the deportation to Treblinka of 45,200 more.Church-going, bible-quoting people doing extrajudicial killings or applauding them? Don’t be surprised For they, as we all are, are but ordinary men too. "

But I think the thesis is thought provoking--it's an intensely interesting idea that the author proposes. It's the idea that regular folks, from your community, and even *you* yourself, if placed in the same situation, would probably have mostly become mass murderers just as these men did. Probably. Of course some personalities are very resistant to the forces that coerce people into such things.The idea is shocking and I found myself resisting it. But Browning does make a fairly strong case, based mostly on clear evidence and logical reasoning. I think he won me over somewhat. I still have to think on it some.Page 159 lists some of the factors that help to explain why 80-90% of the men chose to participate in mass murder. A few stood out to me as especially prevalent in my own society--deference to authority, ideological indoctrination, and conformity.The whole book is especially relevant lately considering the mass hysteria surrounding covid. I would say that if you have found yourself lately parroting heaps of CDC propaganda, sanctimoniously masking up, and vilifying folks who didn't go along with all the nonsense......well, it's possible you have a bit of a mass murderer streak under the surface.

51,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5861649-kelley,Rating 4 out of 5,"Ordinary men committing horrible crimes against humanity Ordinary Men examines the heinous actions of Germany’s Nazi Police Battalion 101 in Poland during WW2. The 500 men in this battalion were responsible for viciously killing 83,000 Jews in just 1-2 years time. That was 166 Jewish deaths per policeman. These policeman weren’t necessarily rabid Nazis. They weren’t high up party officials. They weren’t necessarily members of the vicious SS. Instead what distinguished them was that they were ordinary German men from working class backgrounds, mostly in their later 30s or older who found themselves transferred to Poland and were ordered to kill the Jews they rounded up to make Poland Jew Free. None of the policeman were forced to kill. While some did refuse to follow these orders, which they were permitted to do without penalty or official reprisal, about 90% did willingly take part to varying degrees. Some did kill for a while and then later stopped. Some wouldn’t participate at first but later did take part. Some would kill adults but not children. Others were full-out killers who took fully indiscriminate part throughout. The author, Christopher Browning, explores not only the history of their actions, but he attempts to explain the why behind how ordinary German men became mass killers helping perpetrate one of the most horrific genocides in history. His conclusions are that many factors were in play, and that there is no one-size-fits all explanation. Pervasive cultural anti-semitism. Peer pressure. Extreme obedience to orders. Ideological agreement. Psychological distancing from personal responsibility for one’s actions. All are reasons he cites to explain how this happened. Arguably one of the most famous and controversial books in recent decades about this same topic is Daniel Goldhagen’s Hitler’s Willing Executioners. Both that book and Browning’s Ordinary Men examine the actions of Battalion 101. Yet both authors reach somewhat different conclusions. Goldhagen saw the Battalion’s actions as an inevitable result of the times in which people committed these heinous killings in a united blind deference to the antisemitic extremism espoused by Nazis who saw Germany as besieged by enemies all around them, with the Jews being chief among the evil enemy. Browning however argues a more nuanced view. He sees the danger that ordinary people can all too easily become willing executioners for a variety of reasons, which has happened throughout history many times, even in the post-WW2 era. I read Goldhagen’s book 20+ years ago and it had a huge impact on my view of this topic. Browning’s books is another perspective. Both have value and no matter which conclusion a reader supports, it is clear that ordinary people can perpetrate horrific crimes given the confluence of circumstances. We can only happen that this will never happen again."
52,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56194639-mark,Rating 2 out of 5," There's a difference between a well researched book and a well written one. This book happens to fall into the former and not the latter. Browning chooses to use rapid fire statistics to convey his story. It is not a compelling strategy. His writing is dense and sloppy. It's bogged down in technicalities; the writing could have used a serious revision. I have to also question the main source of this book. Browning uses testimony from Nazis twenty years after these gruesome crimes transpired. Not only are the testimonies in danger of being tainted by memory lapses or repression, but lies because the policemen were under oath. The author relies so heavily on the testimonies of only 210 of the 500 men in the battalion. I do not think these testimonies are sufficient sources for a whole book. Yes, Browning does come to some interesting conclusions. The questions he raises are legitimate, but he takes too long answering them. I wish he elaborated on the questions of the policemen's motivations or beliefs further.  Sure, the actual content is amazing, but the story is bogged down by stats. The locations and logistics about the different regiments are extremely confusing. Also, there is not really a story. There is just a bunch of people. I never felt connected or emotionally involved in the book. Not every book has to evoke emotion, but this book felt detached and boring. It was a slog to just get to the end. When I did get to the end I encountered a petty and sad rebuttal by the author to another author. I couldn't even finish this pathetic afterword. He could have simply submitted it as an op-ed in the NYT, but instead he decided to re-release the book while writing a 30 page response. What a joke. It's a shame that the book didn't grab my attention because the source material deserves widespread recognition. "
53,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3620323-sarah,Rating 4 out of 5,"https://www.bookwormblues.net/2021/08...I’ve been reading about, and researching, the Eastern front of World War II for YEARS. I’m fascinated by it. When I was in school, all I learned about was mostly what happened in France, and the UK and I understand why. To young Western minds, those places make more sense. However, the Eastern Front is far more fascinating. I feel, in a lot of ways, that by not knowing what happened in these areas, we don’t really understand the war. The things that happened in Eastern Europe are tragic and horrible, and often so hard to hear about it takes a long time to get through books and articles on it, but by not knowing this stuff, we are not hearing the stories of thousands and thousands of people who will never be heard.It’s important to know these things. It’s important to be uncomfortable sometimes. It’s important to never forget. One of the things that interests me the most regarding this sort of thing is how ordinary people became part and part and party to absolutely horrible actions. There have been studies over the years about how people act when put under strict authority, and there have been plenty of books about how the war was perceived by those inside and outside of Germany, but I will absolutely never stop being completely baffled by these people who went out and did absolutely unbelievable things, and then returned home later, “Yes, I’d like potatoes with my roast. Work was fine today. How are the kids?” Another book that touches on this a bit is here.Ordinary Men is one of those books that profoundly impacted me, and I’d honestly suggest anyone with a passing interest in World War II to put this on their essential reading list. Now, make no mistake, this is not an easy book to read. Before the author even gets to Reserve Battalion 101, he goes over a bit of the relocation actions going on in some places like Poland, Vienna, Ukraine and the like. And when I say “relocation” I mean, you get to read reports written by the officers who sat on the trains that were moving thousands of people were moved to death camps. You get to read one officer complaining that his butter was rancid (no mention of a train packed full of people going to a death camp, just a complaint about rations and how they didn’t survive the heat), and another talking about how the trains were so overstuffed, 2,000 people died, and they shot so many people they used up all their ammunition and all the additional ammunition they were given, so they had to resort to throwing stones at those trying to escape.Reserve Police Battalion 101 was a group from Hamburg, mostly working-class men from middle class backgrounds. They were older, in their late thirties to mid-forties, which meant at the time they were conscripted into World War II, they were old enough to have grown up in a time before Nazi ideology took root (meaning, many of them were not party members). They were used for many purposes, mass executions, moving Jewish individuals to death camps, and the like. By the time World War II was over, it was assumed they had moved 45,000 to death camps like Treblinka, and another 38,000 murdered in mass executions.What makes these men interesting is how normal they were, and how they took to the tasks they were given. The author gets his information from interviews done with 200+ surviving members of RPB101 in the 1960s and tells what happened from those interviews, showing how the group was divided, and why these seemingly ordinary men undertook such actions seemingly willingly. The author suggests that one of the ways this group did what they did was largely based on group dynamics. He explained he thought the RPB101 was broken into three groups:Sadists, who went out of their way to torture, beat, humiliateYour average soldier who was just following orders. A group of men who asked to be excused from killing the Jews. There was no punishment inflicted upon those asking to be excused, but it is important to note that no one complained about taking people to death camps. They knew what they were doing. They knew what would happen there, but as I’ve seen in many other books, “out of sight, out of mind” is powerful. Once they had done their duty, the rest wasn’t up to them, and I think largely they mentally excused themselves from the burdens of those deaths. I find the fact that no one was punished for opting out of the executions interesting. I was watching a documentary about the Einsatzgruppen last night, and the officer in charge of the actions in Ukraine specifically ordered every soldier in his area kill at least one Jew. The reason why was twofold: First, it implicated everyone. Secondly, it spread out the burden of the action (More people doing a thing meant less work for everyone involved.).So, in some ways the lack of punishment was the most interesting detail to me, but it worked hand in hand with the pressure to conform. Punishment wasn’t necessary, in most cases, because leaving the dirty work to their comrades, for some, likely became unbearable. In a tightknit group, wherein the only real social contact are people in their group, being a nonshooter often isolated people beyond what they could tolerate. There was no wider network of social support. If you become isolated and an outcast from your own group, especially in wartime, what do you have left?Browning explores a bit of not just the circumstances surrounding RPB101, but also how things changed over time. He shows how powerful conformity and authority can be. While I do think it is important to note that these are just his interpretations of events, and he has come under fire for this book (notably from Daniel Goldhagen’s book Hitler’s Willing Executioners), this is an interesting book to read because it shows that not everything is black and white. Even the worst things in the world can have some uncomfortable gray.I do think it is important to understand that this is just the author’s psychological interpretation of events, and not bedrock fact. The only way we will ever know why any of these men did what they did is if we ask them, and they aren’t alive anymore so we are left with bits of history, stories, interviews, eyewitness accounts and the like. It is, however, an important and compelling book which gives the reader pause. We are not so far from depravity as we like to think, and perhaps that is the reason Ordinary Men is so haunting."

I do take issue with the book's organization; the author takes us through a lot of details of where this unit went and what they did on a daily basis, without telling the reader why. Then he ends the book, goes to the Afterword -- which is a good 1/3 of the text! -- and only then gets into what seems like the real point of the narrative, to understand how anyone brought himself to participate in the Holocaust. He does do a good job of discussing the various framings of what made the genocide possible and only here finally seems to make his own point and defend that position. So -- in sum it's a rather confusingly-presented argument that finally clarifies a great deal."

The author lays out the difficulties in conducting such a study and throughout let’s the reader know when he is inferring and something isn’t a hard fact. This book has a counterpart from another author that disagrees with Browning’s interpretation. The section of the book dedicated to responding to it is cool to read and seems to do a good job presenting the arguments about what drove these men to kill unarmed Jews indiscriminately. It essentially boils down to this book arguing that the holocaust could be perpetrated by anyone and Goldhagen’s view is that the circumstances in Germany (specifically the antisemitism) are what made it not only easy, but the desired answer for the Jews from the men committing the acts. It’s enlightening to read the differing views that come from researching the same materials and shows where historians argue and disagree about things, showing it’s not as clear cut as we would hope to believe.

The historical compilation is largely broad-stroked.

64,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/143678171-callum,Rating 5 out of 5,"Reserve Police Battalion 101 comprised several hundred middle-aged men from Hamburg, Germany. Most were unaffiliated with the Nazi Party prior to the Hitler's rise to power in 1933; most had no military experience; most had families; most were working class; and none exhibited degenerate predispositions. Nonetheless, these ordinary men participated in the incipient phases of the mass extermination of European Jewry in World War II--i.e., the Holocaust. Why? Utilising primary historical sources and psychological literature, Christopher Browning compellingly argues that the answer lies in human nature. Reserve Police Battalion 101 were sent to the Poznan and Lodz regions of Poland to execute Hitler's genocidal directives. They forcibly expelled tens of thousands of Poles and murdered thousands of Jews via gunfire. As extermination camps were built, the battalion subsequently rounded up Jews to be deported to their demise. Browning states that only a few men refused direct participation in killings when given the option. They were instead given auxiliary tasks. However, more than 90% complied. Browning suggests that it was primarily out of conformity, with a minority citing violent antisemitic beliefs and fidelity to Nazi ideology. Browning references the Stanford prison experiments and Milgram's obedience to authority experiments, revealing that most individuals act malevolently when ordered to by their superiors. Extrapolating these findings to totalitarian regimes, he argues that the actions of Reserve Police Battalion 101 are the norm. Indeed, atrocities like My Lai indicate that even individuals from liberal democracies can commit inexplicable acts in warfare. Ordinary people under certain conditions are prone to commit wicked acts. Only extraordinary people resist. Most people may think they are in the latter group, yet this is empirically false."

There are two significant additions at the end of the book.This book has been on my list to read for quite some time and his part of the collection of books that try to examine the actions of presumably ordinary people in horrendous activities. In this case the activity is the holocaust and specifically the mass killing of Jews in Poland after the German occupation particularly in 1941 and 1942.The book covers the style of rounding up Jews that was common in Poland. Special groups of police would go to places and round up Jews and shoot them on the spot or if there was a nearby railroad load them onto trains and ship them to a concentration camp.The issue is what kind of people would agree to this kind of work? I am drawn to try to understand the answer to this question in part because my young daughter has spent time in Cambodia and Rwanda and Sri Lanka. In each place there has been substantial mass killing often one neighbor against another.

By examining in detail just one German Police Battalion stationed on the Eastern front, responsible for the murder of thousands of Jews and other civilians, Christopher Browning discovered something even more terrible than Arendt. These men were not banal. A higher-than-average number had college degrees and some were former lawyers, doctors, and school teachers. None had a record of anti-semitism and few had been political before the war. Browning's most controversial claim is that their killings were largely improvised, not carried out under strict orders drawn from a plan from above. In other words, they killed because they could, not because they had to. Horror without motivation or instruction."

One small step at a time is the answer, one heartless sin a day, with just enough time for each man to become acclimatized to the new reality before plunging into the abyss once more.Books like these better defend the fact that the Holocaust was no lie than any WWII anthology ever could. Because of this I consider ""Ordinary Men"" to be compulsory feading for anyone interested in the theme and period. I also consider the book to be an important study on the darker nature of Man, on par with John Keegen's ""The Face of Battle"" and Dave Grossman's ""On Killing""."
69,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/65978670-tiago-faleiro,Rating 5 out of 5,"The story is told of the Reserve Police Battalion (RBP) 101, a Nazi Germany paramilitary formation, mostly involved both killing and ""resettlement"" of Jews in occupied Poland. Like many other books, it tells the horrors of Nazi Germany, but from a very different perspective. The holocaust is more easily explained when it is done by police battalions that were highly Nazified age cohorts (because they were in the ideology) and a product of selective recruiting and intense training and indoctrination. Many of the police battalions had such characteristics, but this battalion did not. Therefore, the atrocities themselves cannot be blamed on such variables, even if they contribute. This is in fact what the title refers to, they were ""ordinary"" men, and it seems like they didn't have any bias to predispose them to commit such atrocities. What I found most baffling about the battalion is the polarity that it displays. When they had their first assignment, the very knowledge of what they had to do was disturbing to them. The commander himself had tears in his eyes as he told the job they were about to perform. In fact, he even offered people who didn't want to take part, didn't have to. Yet, very little outright refused. They did not want to leave the ""dirty"" work to their colleagues.After the first killing, many felt nauseous. Some started to intentionally miss targets. In further assignments, alcohol was an increasingly coping mechanism. There was a heavy sense of shame and horror among the men. However, this didn't apply to all men. And even more importantly, it did not necessarily last. As they had more and more assignments, and also as the way of killing changed (by for example not having to face their victim face to face), the police officers became increasingly detached. There was a distance between ""us"" - the humans, and ""them"" - the Jews. At one point, it was purely routine work. Within the battalion, several groups of men developed. A very tiny minority refused the job outright (fewer than 12 in 500), but others avoided it when possible, and others even volunteered. Sometimes there were so many volunteers they some had to be turned away. The book explores a lot of assignments the battalion was ordered to make, and the reactions of different policemen to what was happening. Something that I wasn't expecting and was the book's mention of social psychology experiments, mostly by Milgram. They are obviously inspired by the events of the 20th century and there is an undeniable parallel, but nevertheless, I was happy to see that the book didn't only stick with history but tried to make connections with psychological science for a most holistic and deeper understanding. In the afterword, the author dives into Goldhagen's criticisms of this book, written a few years after the publication of ordinary men. He argued that the holocaust was built upon the anti-semitic culture of Germany, and viewed the thesis of Ordinary Men as fundamentally flawed. The author gives counter-arguments to said criticism. Perhaps the best one is that there were countless cases of atrocities by the battalion not only to Jews but also to Poles. There was no ""cultural-cognitive"" prerequisite to commit genocide that was essential for the holocaust. It would be good news if that was the case, but unfortunately, it runs much deeper than a specific population or culture. The ultimate thesis of the book is that the massacres were done out of obedience to authority and peer pressure.Browning's arguments and evidence were convincing and further elucidated the nature of the battalion's actions and the holocaust in general. This part of the book wasn't as narrative and it felt like a discussion among historians which started to get more academic than I signed up. But as it progressed as I started to enjoy it more, and it emphasized the need for interpretation of historical events and how hard and yet important such work is. It asks crucial questions that are far from obvious. For example, to which degree was antisemitism fundamental into nazism, and to which degree the antisemitism was already present in German culture but was only used by nazism in a quasi-determined fashion. In some form, it does seem to navigate between a dialogue of where the evil of the holocaust comes from: human nature or ideology. It is quite clear that both play an impact, but it's hard to have a good map of where how much space they occupy without overshadowing the other, and to what degree which one impacts and develops the other. And as obsessed as humanity rightfully was after the 20th-century atrocities and how it impacted psychology and philosophy, I couldn't help but wonder that maybe that wasn't enough. Even more so when I saw so many parallels with current far-right politics. Not necessarily saying they are nazis just because they are on the right (or even far right), but it's impossible to neglect similarities, and likewise it's important to see key differences. Even with Nazi Germany, this was the case. Not all Nazis were antisemitic, and people who were antisemitic weren't necessarily pro-genocide. There are many ""layers"" of ideology and political belief. On one hand, it's wrong to assume it's part of a single continuum of ideology, and on the other hand, it's somewhat naive that they are all independent levels that are fixed and have nothing to do with each other.I really enjoyed the book and highly recommend it. It is an important topic that one should often visit. Not only knowing what happened in a historical manner but fight the topic within your own soul as if it was directly connected to you personally because it is. It's not light reading by any means, although it's also it's not the worst of its kind. In part because it has a historical narrative to it and it's not trying to shock you for its own sake. Regarding the afterword, I found it helpful but it was a bit overkill for laymen in my opinion, and certainly not as good as the first part. If you don't want to dedicate a lot of time to the book, skip both the preface and the afterword. This would make the book only 200 pages or so, and you get the most important insights of it. It's also best to go for the paperback instead of the audiobook, which I used, given it has a fair bit of images that aren't well organized in the accompanying PDF."

The writing is good. The book is about how ordinary, middle aged German men from a mix of backgrounds became mass murderers. The battalion was only made up of 500 men but via shooting and overseeing deportations to death camps killed at least 83,000 Jews. The book follows the process from the first massacre they were involved in then the various massacres they perpetrated over the course of 1942-1943. Then it ends with a long chapter on the psychology of the men and what led them to do the things they did. The main arguments are (1) One of the main motivations for committing the atrocities was peer pressure and a desire to conform, not wanting to look weak / unmanly or to be seen not doing their share of the dirty work and leaving it to others.(2) Fear of punishment was not a motivation as there were plenty of ways the men could get out of the killing.(3) Ideology and anti-Semitic Nazi propaganda made it is for the men to become killers but was not the main cause, as the these were older men who had lived in Germany before the Nazis came to power and the various training materials they had weren't specifically about killing Jews. (4) There was a small group of enthusiastic killers, a main group who did the murders and the shooting but wouldn't volunteer for extra killing, and about 10%-20% who refused. (5) The men who refused to kill tended to do so out of disliking the physical violence of killing rather than out of ethical or moral concerns. It's not a long book, the version I read was 190 pages plus a 40 page afterword describing how another historian who disagrees with him is very wrong and has a rather selective interpretation of the sources. It is an older book (from the 90s) and the Holocaust isn't one of my main areas of interest so I don't know if there has been any major changes in the historical research since then."
79,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20161431-alexa,Rating 4 out of 5,"At times repetitive, at times sluggish, and at times bogged down by historical and geographical minutiae, Ordinary Men is nonetheless a compelling examination of the cultural and social conditions that led a group of “ordinary” German men — namely, non-military, middle-class, middle-aged men — to participate in the Final Solution in Poland. Browning does not assert, as I thought he was going to, that these “ordinary men” did not know what they were doing when they participated, both directly and indirectly, in the heinous extermination of hundreds of thousands of Jewish people in Poland. His main focus is to instead assert that the right combination of factors (e.g. careerism, conformity, division of labor, and deference to authority, among others) can turn any group of people, in any society, anywhere on Earth, into killers. And on that point I decidedly agree. Browning and I do disagree on a few points — I think he extends sympathy to these men where they deserve virtually none, and I think his belief that “it is unlikely [that German] conservatives on their own would have proceeded beyond the initial discriminatory measures of 1933-34 that drove the Jews out of the civil and military services, the professions, and cultural life” is far too hopeful and exculpatory — but I’m extremely glad I read this book. It brings up many important and interesting moral questions that I’ll continue thinking about for months to come. "
80,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13781451-jonathan-blanks,Rating 5 out of 5,"I've been reading histories of the Holocaust since I took a class on the subject in college. Although originally published when I was in high school, the updated version includes a very thorough (and convincing) rebuttal of Goldhagen's assertion that the peculiarity of German antisemitism explains how so many 'ordinary Germans' became--to use the title of his own book--Hitler's Willing Executioners. The Kindle version will prompt the reader to Goodreads and might thus suggest the material following that prompt is simply appendix and notes, but there are several additional essays including the Goldhagen rebuttals and a reflection 25 years after original publication that you should not overlook. At least read the first essay on his conflict with Goldhagen, which by itself was worth whatever I paid for the book. People familiar with the recent reevaluations of Zimbardo's Stanford Prison experiment and, to a lesser extent, the problems with replicability with Milgram's work and other psychological experiments may be put off by Browning's use of their findings to help explain how men who were not hardcore Nazi believers (more typical in SS Einsatzgruppen units) nevertheless became proficient and willing killers of innocents on massive scales. Particularly in the Goldhagen rebuttal postscript, Browning carefully explains that there is no singular explanation for these actions, but we can learn a lot from historical and other psycho-sociological analyses. As evidenced by my five-star rating, I don't think taking Zimbardo at face value undercuts the thesis in a significantly detrimental way.I think books like this one are important because they humanize perpetrators of atrocities. To be clear, this isn't because they deserve sympathy or forgiveness--but because telling their stories makes their crimes more real. There is a tendency to view certain events and institutions in history as abominations, so beyond the pale of acceptability that their perpetrators must have been evil incarnate, so rare or even absent in modern life. But that's not reality, and rarely has been. Humans often do terrible things, and pretending that, collectively, we are somehow so much better intrinsically that we are immune from devolving into such moral depravity is to misunderstand how people and institutions work. It's not pleasant to contemplate, but it is vital that we remember."

Through the lens of the Reserve Police Battalion 101, Browning exposes the sobering reality that anyone, including ourselves, could be capable of such atrocities. This story of ordinary German men, many well into their 40s who were part of this battalion, will leave you scratching your head if you think that there had to be extraordinary circumstances for them to murder over 30,000 Jewish men women, and children.Are you capable of murder? Of mass murder? Is it just certain people under certain circumstances that lead people to do evil things? I could never do something like that you say. Well, that is where you are wrong. Maybe we all have the monster inside us. The book highlights the dangers of groupthink, peer pressure, and blind obedience to authority, which can all contribute to the erosion of one's moral compass and lead to inhumane actions. Browning adeptly navigates the complex psychological and sociological factors that may have influenced the battalion's actions, leaving us with a profound sense of unease and reflection on the potential for evil within all of us. This cautionary tale is a must-read for anyone seeking to better understand the darker aspects of human behavior and the dangers of blindly following authority.I recommend everyone read this book."

I was interested in the psychology of how lower ranked security forces obey difficult commands from the authorizes, as well as the conflicts and the rationales they experience. I assumed the struggles would be similar, but the details would be different across all eras. Ordinary Men opens my eyes to the state of mind of the police forces as something I have never experienced.Before reading this book, I wasn't able to understand why police forces, who are equally affected by the governing of an authoritarian government, would side with a distrusted authority? Was it simply because it was their duty to obey orders? Do they feel obligated to keep peace and order? Did they share a vision with the government that the citizen aren't aware of? Was there a reward or punishment based system that incentivize their actions? Or were they driven by revenge mentality after a series of peaceful protests turned into violence confrontation?The act of the Battalion 101 gave me an idea of the worst we can become. Given the right circumstances and exigencies, any of us can turn into a devil. I am a true believer of people hold accountable to every action they take, however, the police who are unable to think critically of their actions also have my sympathy.My next question is: how can we prevent ourselves from getting into circumstances like this?"

There is not a sweeping narrative and there are few personal moments. This is a book full of facts, dates, numbers, and hypothesis. If you are looking for a straight forward ""this is why men kill"" you will not find it here. The answer is difficult, scattered, and has many, many shades of grey. That being said, I think this is a very interesting, well researched, and important topic. It would be easy to say all people who participated in the Holocaust were 100% evil all the time but it simply isn't true. This book shows that. It also shows how simply being in a war environment can change a person so profoundly, making them do what they never thought they could have. But, this book, at the same time, does not brush off their culpability. It does not make them the victim. Instead it provides reasoning and hopefully useful scope for ourselves, today, to prevent atrocities, big or small, in our society."

NO ONE. In many cases both Jewish and Polish people were shot into mass trenches or burned to death. This book documents how ordinary people took part in mass slaughter of human beings. There were a few sadists, and even fewer people who refused to take part, but most did what they were told. They weren't necessarily anti-semitic, but they has been conditioned after WWI to distrust government and their judicial systems and put their faith in an authoritarian leader and government. Fear, Gain, Deference to Authority, Pressures to Conform and Rationalize One's Choices are the primary motivations for committing horrible crimes. I cannot help but think that our former president's crusade to regain power by lying about the 2020 election and promoting distrust with our government, our elections, our Constitution, and the entire judicial system if it doesn't do what he wants is laying a foundation for a horrific end of the United States.

However, the author lists facts and figures. Only in the very last chapter does he give a cursory explanation which includes a lot of ""it could have been this, it could have been that"", which sounds about as scientific as a dinner-table conversation.

102,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10309967-lauren,Rating 1 out of 5,"This was incredibly disappointing. I was so looking forward to some insight into a group that, overall, isn't really covered by your main stream, historical writings whether due to lack of surviving documentation or lack of survivors willing to speak on the subject, let alone those who will or can accurately recount the events. Unfortunately, Browning under-preforms, even when considering the limited information he had to go on at the time.While he is a history professor, his writing in this is more indicative of one of his students that has several papers due at once and is unsure of which he's writing on at the time. I remember, as a student, reading something and automatically knowing I could use it for history or literature or sociology based on the overall tone of the writing. With this work however, the tone keeps changing and while there are sections that are very numbers-heavy and could be used for a historical essay, overall, it would jump from a very ""sociological"" voice to a ""historical"" voice to a ""psychological"" voice and never really settles into any one area. While this is understandable, based on the subject involved, it does make it difficult to use for reference purposes, especially since none of the positions feel particularly well defended in ANY of the afor mentioned subject areas.It is also difficult to use this book as a true reference piece because it feels heavily biased. While I haven't read enough material on this subject to say one way or another if it is or isn't, the overall feel it gives off makes it nearly impossibly to trust the information presented to you, aside from what is specifically sited and the numerical values provided. That being said, there seems to be a number of references that would be excellent sources for a paper, if that's what you were looking for, and I do intend to look into some of them more to get a better idea of how much of the overall feel of this work is true bias and how much is a lack of information to support a point.It should be noted, though that this changes drastically once you get to the afterword and the ""25 years later"" sections of the book. Perhaps it is because another writer attacked his piece in a way, but he FINALLY defends his position in a way that feels less like a heavily biased opinion essay sprinkled with valuable information and more like an actual informational text that is crossing and uniting subject areas to attempt to understand what brought this group of men to this point, mentally and historically. One final point that I feel must be made, and I really hate to do it, but I feel that I must, is that the author comes across as incredibly petty, particularly in the first few pages of the afterword. Another historian published research on the same subject matter at the same time, apparently, and felt it necessary to criticize Browning's work and interpretation of the information. Well, instead of letting it go, Browning felt the need to bring it up multiple times, almost attacking the other writer in his zealous ""defense"" of his own work. He uses the first few pages of the afterword, not only to start defending his position on the subject at hand, for once, but also to tear down this other author. It comes across as very unprofessional and I would hate to imagine, how he would treat a student who question his view, founded or not, if this is how he treats a colleague.Finally, and this is more against the editor and layout designer than anyone else. The descriptions of the photos are poorly set up and can be a little confusing. There are descriptions of photos several pages away from the photos themselves, not to mention the number of photos indicated in a series do not always match up with the number of photos printed in the book. Whoever was in charge of this really needs to do a better job when this is reprinted again, as I'm sure it will be, especially since Browning actually bothered to rewrite and update AS WELL AS MENTION THAT MORE ACCURATE INFORMATION HAD COME TO LIGHT in regards to the photos printed."

If I didn’t want all my reviews to capture my initial reaction to whatever I just read, I’d wait a few weeks before putting words to my takeaways.This book is about Reserve Police Battalion 101, a group of about 500 middle-aged lower-middle class German men who directly murdered tens of thousands of Jews during the Holocaust. The book gives a nuanced glimpse into the group, and the moral progression (or regression) of different individuals over the course of their deployment. Then, the last section of the book takes a large step back to ask what led these men into such terrible actions. The author clearly shows how there were a few particularly sadistic murderous individuals, and a few morally autonomous individuals who resisted the order to exterminate, however, the vast majority of the battalion were simply “ordinary men”. I am reminded again of Solzhenitsyn’s GENIUS words: “The line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either - but right through every human heart - and through all human hearts.” This is unbelievably applicable today, as so many narratives attempt to categorize individual people entirely within the realm of good or evil, based solely on the group they belong to. This mistake (aside from its murderous outcomes) is probably the most defining similarity between fascist Nazi Germany and communist Soviet Russia. However, also applicable today is the fact that, while ideologies and systems do not make someone definitely good or evil, they do have the capacity to severely magnify the good or evil within people. This book wasn’t perfect, but it’s books like this that provide groudwork for a nuanced and useful approach to confronting societal and individual sin. I’ll end with this enormous quote:“This story of ordinary men is not the story of all men. The reserve policemen faced choices, and most of them committed terrible deeds. But those who killed cannot be absolved by the notion that anyone in the same situation would have done the same as they did. For even among them, some refused to kill, and some stopped killing. Human responsibility is ultimately an individual matter. At the same time, however, the collective behavior of Reserve Police Battalion 101 has deeply disturbing implications. There are many societies afflicted by traditions of racism and caught in the siege mentality of war or threat of war. Everywhere society conditions people to respect and defer to authority, and indeed could scarcely function otherwise. Everywhere people seek career advancement. In every modern society, the complexity of life and the resulting bureaucratization and specialization attenuate the sense of personal responsibility of those implementing official policy. Within virtually every social collective, the peer group exerts tremendous pressures on social behavior and sets moral norms. If the men of Reserve Police Battalion 101 could become killers under such circumstances, what group of men cannot?”"

Olyan emberekről beszélünk, akik nem voltak nácik, közönséges, elsősorban hamburgi illetőségű németek voltak*, nem egy közülük szociáldemokrata múlttal. Átlagemberek. Akik megtanultak ölni. Tulajdonképpen ennyi.Azért még elmondanék egy történetet a bátorságról. Amikor a zászlóalj megérkezett Józefówba, a kis lengyel faluba, Wilhelm Trapp őrnagy, az egység vezetője felvázolta a napi programot. Ez a program meglehetősen különbözött azoktól az alapvetően rendőri tevékenységektől, amiket a zászlóalj addig, ’42 nyaráig végzett. 1500 zsidó lakik a faluban, őket kéne halomra lőni, mondta Trapp. Nemszeretem feladat, úgyhogy aki nem akar részt venni az akcióban, jelezze. Egy ember kilépett a sorból. Nevezzük Otto Schmikének. Amikor a többiek látták, hogy Trapp más feladatot ad neki, újabb 10-12 ember jelentkezett. Az ötszáz főből**. A többiek munkához láttak. Ezerötszáz embert végeztek ki, férfiakat, nőket, öregeket, gyerekeket. A legtöbbjüket közvetlen közelről, a puska bajonettjét a nyakszirtnek támasztva lőtték fejbe. Rutintalanok lévén, a szükségesnél véresebb munkát végeztek, de azért a végére ráéreztek a csínjára. Eközben Otto Schimkét és társait parancsnoki oldalról nem érte komoly hátrány. A legdurvább retorzió az volt, hogy vasárnapi szolgálatra osztották be őket. A gyilkosságban részt vett társak azonban megvetették őket. Gyávák. Azt mondták rájuk, hogy gyávák. Egyszerű lenne azzal letudni, hogy nem, Schimke és társai bátrak voltak. Talán tényleg. De az is lehet, hogy ők csak azt tették, amit mindenkinek legalapvetőbb kötelessége lett volna megtenni: nem öltek. És nem is kockáztattak valami sokat. Lehet, a bátorsághoz ennél valamivel több kéne. Talán nem kellett volna túlélniük. Nem tudom.Nem ismerek jobb könyvet arról, hogyan lesz valakiből (bárkiből?) tömeggyilkos.Csak annyit még, hogy elolvastam, és most nem jó embernek lenni.(Ui.: A kötethez tartozik egy utószó is, amiben Browning Daniel Goldhagennel – a Hitler buzgó hóhérai c. könyv szerzőjével – lefolytatott, meglehetősen híres történészi vitáját összegzi. Nyilván ez a szöveg csak a Goldhagen-mű ismeretében értelmezhető a maga teljességében, de ajánlom azoknak is, akik a kérdéses művet nem olvasták, mert kiváló áttekintését adja a gyilkosok motivációival kapcsolatos kutatásoknak.)* Köztük 14 luxemburgi állampolgár – róluk Browning külön is szót ejt.** A gyilkosságok közben még akadtak, akik besokalltak, és kivonták magukat a pusztításból, akár úgy, hogy elszöktek a kavarodást kihasználva, akár úgy, hogy Trapp őrnagyhoz fordultak. Őket sem érte retorzió. Mindenesetre számuk semmiképpen nem haladta meg az egység 10-20%-át."

This book is also an attempt to explain or identify the ""why"" of their actions. This approach violates the ""rules"" of objective historical writing, but is acceptable as a means of avoiding future rationalizations, motivations, and excuses for violence and atrocities.What struck me most about the historical components of Ordinary Men were the bureaucratic and administrative aspects of slaughter and extreme policing carried out by Reserve Battalion 101. The primary sources quoted in the first few chapters of the book are frightening as they are transit memos and administrative documents that mundanely account for the logistics and implementations of ethnic cleansing. This fits into one of the prominent themes of Browning's book that the hyper-grotesque can transform into the routine through administrative hierarchy, group pressure, individual cowardice, and repeated acts of violence. I was also caught off guard by the background of these police battalion members. Their backgrounds did not exude zealous Nazi Party loyalty or extreme ideological indoctrination, but rather a group of older men, compared to the younger police units and stereotypical military units serving in the few years before the fall of the Third Reich, who were routed in middle-class, working-class, and other mainstream makeups and polities before the they were conscripted into police service. There was no evidence or smoking gun information about volunteering explicitly to carry out the designs of the Final Solution. This group, a small sample from a huge pool of perpetrators, appear to have been caught up in these horrific actions for a variety of reasons and ambiguous root causes. These ""Ordinary Men"" and their actions need to be scrutinized, examined, debated, and discussed to prevent the likelihood of events like this happening in the future. "

A few, manage to evade being the shooters. One or two manage to transfer from the unit. Most of the men do as ordered, some of them, when not supervised let Jews escape. A significant minority turn to eager executioners, and volunteers for the killings. The distance is not great, it happened in a neighboring country, in my fathers time. How would he have reacted?

Rather it highlights the power of inertia wielded by our social dogma of conformity, an attitude particularly strong in Germany at the time. Obedience rather than conviction is key to the totalitarian reshaping of society and values.

Why did they do it?They were in their late 30s and early 40s, deemed too old for military service, and thus conscripted into the Order Police, given the task of guarding occupied Poland after the Wehrmacht invaded Russian in 1942. They were “ordinary men”, working class Germans from Hamburg, clerks, barbers, waiters, plumbers, and construction workers. Few were members of the Nazi party. Compared to the SS, they were less than ideologically devout.In July of 1942, the battalion was ordered to round up 1,800 Jews in the Polish village of Józefów and exterminate them. The battalion was roused from their bunks and trucked to Józefów before dawn, where they were addressed by their commander, Major Wilhelm Trapp.Pale and nervous, with choking voice and tears in his eyes, Trapp visibly fought to control himself as he spoke. The battalion, he said plaintively, had to perform a frightfully unpleasant task. . . . Having explained what awaited his men, Trapp then made an extraordinary offer: if any of the older men among them did not feel up to the task before them he could step out.""Of the 500 men, about 15 stepped out. Over the following year, the battalion would go on to kill 38,000 Jews in massacres, roundups, and forced marches. Some men of the battalion became zealous killers, volunteering for raids, taking pleasure in it. A minority refused to kill, begging off, shirking duty, despite taunts of weakness and cowardice. The majority simply did as they were told but took no pleasure in it. It's worth noting that there were no real consequences for the men to refused to kill. They were teased, but none were courtmartialed or imprisoned.This is not an easy book to read. Not only is the subject matter predictably grim, but it's a rather dry, scholarly work. There is a lot of detail and description without much narrative. The battalion was divided into three companies, each of approximately 140 men when at full strength. Two companies were commended by police captains, the third by the senior reserve lieutenant in the battalion. Each company was divided into three platoons, two of them commanded by reserve lieutenants and the third by the platoon's senior sergeant. Each platoon was divided into four squads, commanded by a sergeant or corporal. The men were equipped with carbines, the non-commissioned officers with submachine guns. Each company also had a heavy machine-gun detachment. . .And so on. The first half of the book lays out the organizational framework of the Nazi Germany's police services, provides an overview of the role police battalions played in occupied territories and the Holocaust, and gives the chronology for Reserve Police Battalion 101's parade of horrors throughout 1942 and 1943. It also attempts a psychological profile of the men, attempting to explain what drove them to mass murder, especially considering that they were given an out by their commander, if they didn't feel up to the killing. The second half of the book (added years after the original publication) is the scholarly equivalent of a bar fight: an erudite, heavily academic rebuttal to Daniel Goldhagen, who wrote a book called Hitler's Willing Executioners in response to Ordinary Men. Goldhagen's thesis is that anti-Semitism, specifically German anti-Semitism, was the root cause of the Holocaust, whereas Browning takes a more nuanced view, drawing a line between the motives at the level of official Nazi policy, and the personal rationalizations of individuals soldiers, arguing that conformity, peer pressure, a desire to avoid looking weak, fear of repercussions, and the moral degradation of war all played a role as much as German's cosmic background radiation of racism. Browning employs social psychology landmarks like Stanley Milgram's shock experiments and the Stanford prison experiments in his defense. And he tears Goldhagen's methodology apart. To be honest, I found the second half a bit boring. When I first moved to Seattle, my upstairs neighbor was a history graduate student at the University of Washington. Every Friday he had an alcoholic get-together in his apartment for his fellow history nerds, and occasionally I joined them. Invariably, I was the only person there who wasn't writing a PhD thesis, and this made me feel exotic. One time I made the mistake of praising Stephen Ambrose (because I'd recently read Band of Brothers) and I swear, the entire room grimaced, fell uncomfortably quiet, and stared at their feet. ""What?""""It's just that Stephen Ambrose is a terrible historian,"" and they proceeded to explain why, for a half hour. It turns out that I'm lightweight as a history buff, because I prefer a good narrative over copiously researched detail, and I'm willing to forgive the occasional inaccuracy or mild plagiarism. Band of Brothers was a good read, well written, engaging, populated by memorable characters, including the guy from Office Space. I want to lose myself in a story more than I want to get bogged down in arcane academic controversies. Sue me."

Trigger warning: all the violence and Holocaust triggers.An exploration of the exploits of Reserve Police Battalion 101 in Poland as it relates to ""Jewish actions"" with a view toward the psychology of the policemen and their participation in such an evil regime.The majority of the book focuses on what the reserve police battalions were, the organization, origin, and composition of Reserve Police Battalion (RPB) 101, and then the utilization of RPB 101 by Himmler and the SS to help carry out shootings of Jewish people or rounding up Jewish people onto trains to be sent to the concentration camps, primarily in 1942. RPB 101 is chosen because of the rich documentation regarding its participants in later war crimes trials and depositions. The author then attempts to apply recent discoveries in the field of social psychology to explain how it came about that a small percentage remained disturbed at the ""Jewish actions"" and found ways to not participate; many were disturbed at ""shooting actions"" but did not think twice about roundup and collection actions which were understood to lead to death; some became more acclimated to the ""shooting actions"" over time; and a small percentage truly believed and seemingly even took pleasure in the violence they perpetrated. I understand why the author felt compelled to lay out the whole story of RPB 101 in such detail, but it makes for very difficult reading. To endure, one must become numb to the numbers to some degree, and I am not sure if that is healthy. But the purpose of the work is very important. It is easy to demonize all Germans of the era as fully on board with National Socialism and its desire to purge Europe of Jewish people. It proves far more difficult to read primary source documentation from Germans and to see that the situation proved far more complex: in all likelihood it was a small (but loud, active, and prevalent) minority fully on board with National Socialism; another significant percentage that might have appreciated what was done for Germany but not a fan of how Hitler was doing things; and another significant percentage very much opposed to National Socialism. RPB 101 came from an area, Hamburg, which featured very little support for National Socialism; its men tended to be a little older and remembered previous regimes. The story puts to lie the idea that all had to do what they were told or face death themselves; from the beginning of the ""Jewish actions"" it was possible to avoid participating in shootings, and one officer was able to almost always avoid any ""Jewish action."" One would get branded as ""weak,"" but no other action was necessarily taken. We learn how much alcohol was consumed so that the men could carry out their orders; it is clear that the shooting was not easy for a good number of them. Yet, indeed, more than not went along with it and participated in it for a kaleidoscope of reasons, but many centering on living according to the social expectations of the moment. When those social expectations changed radically over the next thirty years, many of the men were able to conform to the new standards and found ways to rationalize what they had done. In short, one finds out quickly that to demonize all Germans as full Nazis is to miss out on the societal tendencies that led what had been considered one of the foremost and ""civilized"" nations to participate in such brutality...and that other ""civilized"" nations are not immune. This seems very apropos in light of what we have experienced over the past decade in America.An ancillary purpose is to remind Western readers that much of the Final Solution did not take place in any concentration camp but in the kinds of actions done by RPB 101: shooting Jewish people in Polish ghettos. It rounds out the story more fully and explains why so many of the deaths come from the 1942-1944 timeframe.This edition also includes the author's rebuttal to another scholar's arguments as well as an additional assessment of the evidence twenty-five years after the book's original publication. These are useful resources.Should you read this? Yes, but it is not a fun time. But if you're committed to ""never again,"" it's good to know what ""it"" is that you never want to see again, and what to do about ""it"" when it rises up again."
120,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"First of all, I waited too long to write this review. I'm trying to wait a week or so after completing books to go back and write reviews. I have two reasons for this: spaced repetition and perspective. Because I'm trying to improve on my reading retention, I find that going back to my highlights, the table of contents, and any notes that I made about a week later seems to strengthen the part of the neural network that I use to remember books (spaced repetition). Secondly, I find that my immediate ""hot take"" on a book is not always in alignment with how I feel about it after putting it down for a little while. I'm not sure which take is more accurate, but I'm trying to bias my reviews toward my remembering self rather than my experiencing self. Alas, all of these carefully laid plans were for naught. I've let this book sit long enough that I've most likely forgotten many of the details. Regardless, I do remember a few things.This books was an investigation by a historian into the experience and testimony of a German police battalion and the part that they played in the final solution in Poland. Because police battalion 101 has some of the best documented testimonies, several historians have written about them (more on this later). The police battalion was made up of some policemen, but most were middle--class citizens that were conscripted. The average age of the battalion was in the mid-30s somewhere; a good deal older than some other battalions and the army in general. Browning wrote this book to try to determine how it happened that a group of seemingly ordinary people could have participated in such atrocities (the roundup and extermination of the Jewish people of Poland). This is not an attempt absolve anyone, but rather to understand them. In his words:""This recognition does indeed mean an attempt to empathize. What I do not accept, however, are the old clichés that to explain is to excuse, to understand is to forgive. Explaining is not excusing; understanding is not forgiving. Not trying to understand the perpetrators in human terms would make impossible not only this study but any history of Holocaust perpetrators that sought to go beyond one-dimensional caricature.""I think that this is a question that many of us have asked in our adult lives. How did this happen? Was Germany a country filled with sadistic, rabid, anti-Semites? Was it a blind obedience to authority? A mob mentality driven by camaraderie and conformity? Although anti-Semitism was certainly part of picture, the author seemed to find conclusively that it wasn't the driving motivation for the rank and file:""In terms of motivation and consciousness, the most glaring omission in the interrogations is any discussion of anti-Semitism. For the most part the interrogators did not pursue this issue. Nor were the men, for understandable reasons as potential defendants, eager to volunteer any illuminating comments. With few exceptions the whole question of anti-Semitism is marked by silence. What is clear is that the men’s concern for their standing in the eyes of their comrades was not matched by any sense of human ties with their victims. The Jews stood outside their circle of human obligation and responsibility. Such a polarization between “us” and “them,” between one’s comrades and the enemy, is of course standard in war.""Most of the policemen seemed to want to defer their responsibility for their actions up the chain of command:“Subjects deny conformity and embrace obedience as the explanation of their actions.”27 Yet many policemen admitted responding to the pressures of conformity—how would they be seen in the eyes of their comrades?—not authority.""This should terrify us, but probably should not surprise us. Human history is chalk full of instances of this type of horrific group behaviour, and many of these tendencies show up in the lab as well. In the now famous Stanford prison experiments, sadism was the norm rather than the exception when normal participants were told to act as guards:""Those who emphasize the relative or absolute importance of situational factors over individual psychological characteristics invariably point to Philip Zimbardo’s Stanford prison experiment.16 Screening out everyone who scored beyond the normal range on a battery of psychological tests, including one that measured “rigid adherence to conventional values and a submissive, uncritical attitude toward authority” (i.e., the F-scale for the “authoritarian personality”), Zimbardo randomly divided his homogeneous “normal” test group into guards and prisoners and placed them in a simulated prison. Though outright physical violence was barred, within six days the inherent structure of prison life—in which guards operating on three-man shifts had to devise ways of controlling the more numerous prisoner population—had produced rapidly escalating brutality, humiliation, and dehumanization. “Most dramatic and distressing to us was the observation of the ease with which sadistic behavior could be elicited in individuals who were not ‘sadistic types’.”Similarly, subjects have proven very vulnerable to the influence of authority in the Milgram experiments conducted at Yale University:""In a series of now famous experiments, Milgram tested the individual’s ability to resist authority that was not backed by any external coercive threat. Naive volunteer subjects were instructed by a “scientific authority” in an alleged learning experiment to inflict an escalating series of fake electric shocks upon an actor/victim, who responded with carefully programmed “voice feedback”—an escalating series of complaints, cries of pain, calls for help, and finally fateful silence. In the standard voice feedback experiment, two-thirds of Milgram’s subjects were “obedient” to the point of inflicting extreme pain.""How should we feel about the author's conclusions that these people were not evil, but rather influenced by their environment and context? To me, the warning from this period of history should blare loudly and clearly. Human nature is easily influenced to perpetrate inconceivable cruelty under the right combination of circumstances. Rather than reassure ourselves that it would not have happened to us, we should act to ensure that we live in a society where it could not happen to anyone.Lastly, a quick note on the genre. Each time that I read history, I'm of two minds. One the one hand, I appreciate the efforts of historians to retain an objective distance from the subject and to portray only the facts; adding no narrative flair. However, this can make for dry reading. I thought that the author resolved this trade-off beautifully. All but the very last chapter of the book were the historical narrative. In the last chapter, Browning gave his analysis of the contents of his book. In two elongated afterwords, he engaged with the critiques that he'd gotten from other historians that had written books on the same topic. Analyzing the disagreements, contrasting the perspectives, and engaging in the debate on this topic was the most interesting part of the book for me."
121,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/85574249-sarah,Rating 3 out of 5,"I was recommended this book by an educator at my city's Holocaust museum, primarily because of my own job. This is the ultimate ""banality of evil"" kind of book - an examination of how and why a group of Germans from a broad cross-section of society and not within the usual confines of the military or ""elite"" forces like the Gestapo became active participants and perpetrators of the Jewish genocide. Like the title says, they were ordinary men.This book is now 30 years old, although the longest sections are an afterword written in response to another historian's critique and a ""25 years later"" section exploring other theories and discoveries in this field. I will say that I am more persuaded by the multi-causal version of this book, saying these men were driven to murder by a variety of internal and external pressures despite ultimately having a choice to participate, rather than the critiquing historian who apparently just summed up all their actions as plain anti-Semitism. That said, I don't know if it's my age and education - I have been told about the horrors of the Holocaust in unblinking detail for decades now, perhaps unlike older generations, and I also have a degree in psychology - but I didn't find anything revelatory here.First, I was struck by confusion of why this was recommended to me. The units were called ""Police"", but the majority of these men were not police before the war, nor were they afterward. They were conscripted men who were usually a little too old to serve in the regular military and not fanatic enough to be in the SS. It was an accurate portrayal that anyone is capable of almost anything though. And I was interested in how he differentiated between the objectors, the ones who complied, and the enthusiastic killers.Second, this reads like a doctoral thesis. That is, quite dry given the subject matter. At this point, I have heard so many horrors about the Holocaust (and tbh, witnessed so much death up close in my life), that I've gotten accustomed to it and wasn't shocked. I knew that would be true going in, but I still was interested in knowing the psychology behind the killers' behavior. But because there were 100s of them or because of lack of primary sources, it still felt very much like an overview and a broad study. It didn't dig deep enough for me, although, admittedly, this is probably impossible to do now. But I guess I spent the majority of the time comparing this book to ""King Leopold's Ghost"" about Belgian atrocities in the Congo, which was about an older genocide but with such clarity and language that sticks with me 20 years later. (I do think there are, ironically, more primary sources for the Congo in letters and diaries, so that might be the reason.)Lastly, I think the afterword was the best section and the most clear distillation of the thesis, which made it a little confusing as to why it wasn't clearer in the original text. (Maybe Browning just needed someone to argue with to inject more emotion into his writing.) The sentences I found the most chilling and particularly salient for our times were the ones closing the afterword, where he rejected the other historian's proposition that this could really only have happened in Germany in that era and said that it is clearer to him that any group of humans can commit any atrocities in any time and place. That is something with which, unfortunately, I agree wholeheartedly.Bottom line - important book, but for many people in 2024, I don't think it's telling us anything new (or at least not me)."
122,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33069094-rodrigo-azuero,Rating 5 out of 5,"Why did most men in reserve police battalion 101 become killers? How can a group of ordinary men be driven to commit some of the most atrocious acts a person can possibly do? This is the central question that author Christopher Browning addresses in his book. The men who are part of Police Battalion 101 (PB101) are not exceptional Germans by any means. They are not necessarily traditional Nazi party members, nor highly qualified professionals or people whose anti-semitic feelings made them stand from the average German. These are ordinary Germans and thus, the circumstances that led this group of people to be a major force during the Jewish holocaust is well suited to understand what drives ordinary men to become killers. During the first part of the book the author summarizes the main activities in which PB101 took part during the Jewish Holocaust. Although this part is very hard to read given the gruesome crimes committed by PB101, the author does it in a very organized and eloquent way. This in itself would make a great book given the amount of archival work that was probably necessary to do it. Nonetheless, what makes this book unique is how the description of such actions are linked to answering the question of how ordinary men can become killers. In the last chapters Browning aims to answer the main question posed at the beginning of the book. [Why did most men in reserve police battalion 101 become killers?]. He presents various theories and exposes the pros and cons of each of them. [Can all this be explained by how deeply ingrained was anti-semitism in the German's ethos of the time? Is this the result of ''peer pressure"", group conformism?]. You may agree or disagree with most of the arguments presented by the author (In particular, I do not agree with his explanation) but I believe he does a good expository work. In the end, the author finishes with a worrying conclusion as ""I fear that we live in a world in which war and racism are ubiquitous... In such a world, I fear, modern governments that wish to commit mass murder will seldom fail in their efforts for being unable to induce `ordinary men' to become their `willing executioners'"".The current version of the book has three 'last chapters'. The last chapter of the book, an ""Afterword"", and a chapter titled ""Twenty-five Years later"". After the book's publication, another Holocaust, author Daniel Goldhagen, has challenged Browning's explanation of what drove ordinary men to become mass murderers. Goldhagen and Browning disagree on the extent to which anti-semitism was present in German society and could possibly be a major force explaining this phenomenon. [Goldhagen claims the almost universal anti-semitism in German society plays a central role in the explanation whereas Browning's answer does not put racism as a central or fundamental element]. The 'Afterword' and ""Twenty-five Years later"" are in part a response to Goldhagen and others' critiques but also are an explanation of how the additional evidence that has been made available since the book's first publication has had an effect on the interpretation of this phenomenon in Holocaust studies. Although I believe that the three aforementioned chapters could be summarized into one, having them in such a sequence gives the author a good idea about how the academic debate has evolved during the last 25 years."

Denn Daniel Noah Goldhagen stützte sich bei seinem Schuldkult-Leckerbissen Hitlers willige Vollstrecker auf dieselben Quellen, verstümmelte aber etliche Zitate für ein passendes Ergebnis.Die neueren Ausgaben bestehen aus vier Teilen, die ersten beiden sind der Grundtext, Vorstellung der Aktivitäten dieses Bataillons aus Männern, die zu alt für den Frontdienst waren, aber bei der Ausführung ihres Auftrags, nach anfänglichen Widerständen, eine hohe Todesrate produzierten.Im Gegensatz zu Goldhagen, geht B. den Motivationen mitzumachen oder sich weitgehend zu entziehen, ziemlich gründlich hinterher, vereinfacht ausgedrückt machten Karrierepoliziten lieber mit, während Männer mit anderem beruflichem Hintergrund/Erfolg versuchten, ihren Anteil an den Aktionen zu minimieren.Im vierten Teil geht B. auf die seither erschienen Arbeiten zu ähnlichen Einheiten ein, die ideologisch maximal auf Kurs waren, trotzdem kamen diese „ganz normalen Männer“ auf Platz vier in dieser unseligen Statistik ins Ziel.Der zweite Teil beschäftig sich mit den Motivationen, dabei zieht B. allerlei neuere Forschungen und Sozial-Experimente zur Erklärung heran, abgesehen von der üblichen Sadistenquote hat der Gruppendruck und das Gefühl der Volksgemeinschaft viel zur hohen Quote an Mitmachern beigetragen, auch wenn es möglich war, sich der Schießpflicht zu entziehen, - gerade Familienväter machten bei Frauen und Kindern anfangs davon Gebrauch. Apropos Gruppendruck oder soziale Zwänge, die deutsche Goldhagen-Rezeption hat davon profitiert, wer nicht in die Lobeshymnen einstimmte, war per se ein Unmensch oder Nazi. Erst als der Autor beim Nachfolger allzu sehr überzog, brach die Blase in sich zusammen.Auch heutzutage funktioniert das Phänomen immer noch prächtig, aus der Angst von sozialen Nachteilen oder das Gefühl zu den „Guten“ gehören zu müssen, lässt sich eine kritische Masse Deutscher in allerlei Weltrettungsprojekte auf fragwürdiger wissenschaftlicher Basis verwickeln (Klima statt Rasse). Auch wenn das Dogma der Toleranz (alias maximaler Bevorzugung wirklich oder vermeintlich von den Nazis verfolgten Minderheiten) die Volksgemeinschaft ersetzt hat, ändert das wenig am Muster: so lange es einem guten Zweck dient, sind genügend Deutsche zu (selbst)mörderischen Aktionen und Aktivitäten gegen anders Denkende bereit. Das haben die letzten Jahre deutlich bewiesen, der inflationäre Gebrauch des Nazi-Etiketts für alle, die nicht mitziehen und sich damit aus der Gemeinschaft der Guten“ ausschließen, macht die Grünen Weltretter, die gerade mit rein-arischen Kindern in Bayern auf Stimmenfang gehen, zu Adolfs wahren Erben.

124,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70019675-cliff-ward,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book is a very tough read. Words can hardly describe and tears are not enough. As Nietzsche said - 'Be careful when you stare into the abyss as it will stare right back at you.' But it's essential these stories are not lost or denied. We need to renew the effort to teach the whole world and especially the young, the facts of what happened.The Reserve Police Battalion 101 were made up of older men not eligible for the regular army and mostly from Hamburg which was the least Nazi indoctrinated area of Germany. Many were uneducated manual workers and some were certainly union members, possibly directly opposed anti-nazis when the Nazis came to power. Nevertheless they were sent to Poland as a controlling force of the base population as the eastern front war moved into Russia. The German High Command in-turn seconded the Battalion 101, a group of 500 men, to work under direct command of the SS to murder Jews and also to round up Jews in Ghettos for shipment to the concentration camps. During the year 1942-3 where overall 80% of the murders in the Final Solution were commited, Battalion 101 murdered 38,000 and transported 45,200.The focus of the book is to look at why this happened. What was in the minds of the killers and what made them continue even when in the very beginning they were given the option to quit. Initially only around 10% refused. The revealing and very hard to accept suggestion is that mere peer pressure and the fear of walking away from the group and the overriding authority of senior officers giving orders was enough to lead these men into cold blooded murder. After the killing started all kinds of effects start to take place. Some more did withdraw but others started to kill more easily. When the SS brought in more experienced murderers recruited from Russian POWs who would have otherwise been killed in Nazi camps, the group becomes even more vicious. Although our nature is to declare those involved as evil monsters none of us were ever exposed to such a situation. Atrocities which occurred under the Nazis can also be seen in many other periods in history. In the Japan war, in Stalin Russian, in Mao China, in Cambodia, in Rwanda. In public lynchings, in drug wars, in massacres during the colonization of the world. In early conquests around the world before European expansion. The list goes on and on the further we look back and the less we discriminate. As much as we fear it and want to strongly deny it, the potential for evil exists in all of us."

The 101 battalion consisted of men who failed to meet the standards of regular military duty. Mostly middle aged men from Hamburg without any strong Nazi party affiliations. This ""negative selection"" process is important to establishing the author's thesis - that the people carrying out the worst atrocities of WWII were regular people. The men from the battalion weren't either particularity racist or bloodthirsty yet they committed unspeakable war crimes.The author uses judicial testimonies from the members of the battalion extrapolated with German reports and letters - as they tended to underestimate the scope of the crimes and make the case harder to counter. And even underestimation makes the acts nothing but heinous. The author's work in unearthing the dynamics of the battalion and critique-proofing his work is very impressive.Yet I must admit that reading about the crimes made me desensitized - after a couple of chapters the war crimes turned into a numbers game in my mind without real people or suffering. The book interested me because of the psychological aspect of the banality of evil - that almost everyone can be turned into a killer and that under a veneer of civilization we're all savages. And while that is the central thesis of the book it doesn't take a central part of the narration - the focus is on the historical argument for the thesis not a psychological one. The author concentrates on the daily life of the man in ranks and their officers and on the recounting the atrocities they committed. The focus is on the acts themselves, the abstainers, the mitigating or aggravating circumstances and not the psychological state of the men committing those acts.I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in history of WW II or a factual, almost raw, reference of processes that make ordinary men into war criminals."
126,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35539552-addy,Rating 5 out of 5,"Highly Recommended This book takes an in depth look at one of the agents of the Nazi's ""Final Solution""; a group of, as the title implies, ""ordinary men"" in Reserve Police Battalion 101. The author writes about the horrible actions they were involved in, and offers possible insight into the mind of these men turned into murderers. I was aware that the book I had pulled off my shelf was significant; how great the significance didn't strike me until I actually began reading the book. In Józefów, alongside the men of the Police Battalion, I suddenly realized the weight of what I was holding in my hands. There was no remarkable predisposition in any of these men that singled them out for the violent actions they were assigned to carry out against the Jewish people of Poland, and yet here they were, on a July morning; ordinary men killing other ordinary men, women and children. This book is both a testimony, and a look into the psychology of the men of this particular Police Battalion. I appreciated the way the author structured the book. He offers a roadmap into the mind of these soldiers; starting first by describing their actions, then investigating why the policemen engaged in these atrocities from a psychological standpoint. He is careful not to pool all the soldiers in the Battalion into one single group, sharing a singular motivation. Instead, he reveals the multiple different personalities that emerged as a result of the horrific task ordered to Reserve Police Battalion 101. This book is important in helping understand the mindset of men not originally imbued with the desire to kill; and I would recommend it as valuable reading for anyone interested in the Holocaust. But it is also a valuable resource in understanding the human capacity for unthinkable violence. "
127,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18846038-william-nist,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is an analysis of why an ordinary group of German policemen, enlisted by the 3rd Reich to cleanup after military expansion in Poland in 1941/42, could possibly follow genocidal orders and kill point blank 38,000 Jews, while supervising the shipment of untold others in train cars to extermination camps. The author views this behavior through a multi-layered psycho-sociological perspective. Through an in-depth look at the Battalion 101's post war interviews, the author has reconstructed both the possible motivations and the cultural/political substrate of these German police officers. The phenomena of social conformity within a police unit (Blue Wall of Silence?), peer pressure, deference to authority, and the legitimizing power of government all play a role in this outrageous behavior. The history of anti-Semitic presuppositions in German culture is also explored and certainly part of the explanation. The ability of a minority of highly motivated leaders, to draw a society into racial and ideological hatred or at least complicity; gradually acclimatizing the population to a group's social undesirability (Shit-hole countries) is shockingly relevant even today. The bottom line for Browning is that the preconditions for this behavior still exist in our world. Racism and war are still widespread, the power of government and media propaganda to legitimize odious behavior has been improved and is widespread, and peer pressure and social conformity are still part of human behavior; thus the ""Ordinary Men"" of our time are certainly not immune from what is considered humankind's lowest moral abyss.

128,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64973276-mana,Rating 4 out of 5,"Browning contributes to the historical scholarship on the Holocaust with an interesting focus on the eponymous ordinary men who were asked to commit the vilest crimes in human history. He does so with a case study of the 101st Order Police Battalion, built from the testimony of several hundred members two decades after their actions in 1942-1943. With few exceptions, the majority of these men willingly complied with the mass killing, forced deportation, and the systematic hunt of Polish jews. The fundamental conclusion he reaches is that the compliance of these men was motivated not by radical anti-Semitic ideology or military coercion, but by simple psychosocial forces of group cohesion and conformity. The implication is chilling: it is remarkably easy to persuade large groups of men to commit acts of tremendous violence and cruelty towards others. His argument is broadly convincing, and compellingly told through the many anecdotes collected via testimony. However, his thesis is limited by its scope of applicability and limitations in sourcing. While Browning's work gives a compelling rationale behind how these crimes are committed, it's historical scope is limited in that it does not seek to understand the broader origins of the Holocaust, only it's methodology in execution. It is also limited in psychological scope, where the studies of Milgram and Zimbardo are alluded to, but not fully related to the mechanism behind why some soldiers turned crueler than others. The limitations in sourcing mean that there is not a statistical analysis of what characteristics were shared by those more likely to turn crueler or refuse to commit these heinous acts. Browning also concedes that sources are somewhat limited in reliability due to both differing memories and perceptions, as well as the incentive for soldiers to lie about ideological leanings or harbored anti-Semitism, given that they were under investigation for war crimes. Nevertheless, despite its limits in sourcing and applicability, Browning’s Ordinary Men is an effectively told story that convincingly gives an explanation for the unthinkable: how ordinary men can allow themselves to commit such extraordinarily evil acts.

130,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"I had recently heard Browning deliver a lecture in Melbourne on his research into Reserve Police Battalion 101, a German ""killing unit"" during the Holocaust involved in the clearing out of ghettos in Eastern Europe (Poland), in the subsequent deportation of Jews to concentration camps, and in the massacre of nearly 40,000 innocent men, women and children. The new edition of his text, ""Ordinary Men"", included the details and context that I sought after that lecture. As well, in the new Afterword and chapter, ""Twenty Five Years Later"", Browning brought new perspectives to the testimony collected in more recent years, and furthered his examination of historical photographs that had been discovered since the first publication. His level of scholarship is impressive, to say the least. However, what distinguishes him from other historians is his ability to narrate his research with such clarity. There is no pretension with Browning; in fact, he tests his own interpretations against those of his critics, with respect and with precision, and gains the reader's tacit acceptance of both his methodology and conclusions.Central to his exploration is how these ""ordinary"" policemen, not SS members or necessarily even members of the Nazi party, became killers: What were the cultural, social and psychological factors that allowed them to participate in some of the most gruesome aspects of the Final Solution?

Curiously, whilst putting the reader in the mind of the perpetrators Browning manages to make the affair even more revolting than he would've done if he'd put you in the mind of the victim.One truly manages to emphasize with the men doing the shooting (excluding that significant minority who didn't seem to have moral qualms and later became enthusiastic killers).The suffering of women and children always gets you in such stories, it's weird how the suffering of men always becomes background noise emotionally.It's also not hard to understand why the men of battalion 101 were way more willing to participate in deportations to death camps like Treblinka rather than doing the killing themselves.Even though the men basically knew what would happen to those Jews, just like the reader does, both the men and I as the reader were relieved simply not to have to face the emotionally distressing scenes of murder.Out of sight, out of mind. Once on the train those Jews just arrested turn into statistics.The beginning of the book is an emotional horrorshow, which every book ever written about the Holocaust I suppose must be.The end of the book is full of great psychological insight.The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because the middle was a bit dull.The middle part was informative but not as emotionally or intellectually stimulating as the beginning and end respectively."
132,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1318729-kb,Rating 4 out of 5,"Christopher R. Browning's Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Batallion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland looks at this specific police battalion and their involvement in the Holocaust. Browning explains the makeup of the battalion and where the men came from, and their tasks once sent to Poland. The main focus of the book is how a group of ordinary, middle-aged German men became killers and participants in the Final Solution and why they participated in the killings.Police Battalion 101 was generally made up of men from Hamburg and these men also tended to be middle-aged. They owned their own businesses or had other regular jobs, and had families with children. The jobs these men were given to do in Poland varied. Sometimes they were merely meant to guard Jews that had been rounded up, other times they had to do the rounding-up themselves and shoot those that could not walk (infants, the elderly, the sick), look for Jews in the towns/villages, take part in the killing of these Jews in forests and areas away from the centre of town and go on 'Jew hunts' to look for those still hiding after the initial clear-out by the battalion.As stated, the whole purpose of the book is why the men participated. This is largely left for the final chapter of the book with the rest being details about what they had to do and how they did it. The importance here is that the men could refuse to take part in the killings and be assigned another task without facing any repercussions. However, as Browning shows, most of the men did not do this. Only a very few ever directly spoke out that they would refuse to participate. Others merely made themselves look busy elsewhere on the scene as the number of people present and the general chaos did not give away what they were doing. Others took part initially but then refused to carry on further. Some would not shoot women and children. Many would purposely aim above their victims to avoid shooting them. Many more would participate and do whatever they were asked. Browning notes that after the first time the men had to kill Jews they were all generally quite disturbed by the event and some physically ill. As they were ordered further killings this sensation gradually decreased.Being middle-aged meant that these men would largely have not been heavily influenced by Nazi propaganda. Therefore, they were not necessarily hardcore anti-Semites (everything being in general terms, of course, some certainly would have disliked Jews regardless. And Browning states that in the post-war trials of these men, it is obvious that they would not have made claims to be anti-Semitic, so to what extent they held these views may never be explicitly known). Many also had no interest in maintaining a career with the police after the war so how they behaved had little importance to them. Having a wife or children back in Germany also played a part in their attitudes. So, even not being particularly anti-Semitic and not facing any consequences for not taking part in the killings, why did most men do it anyways?For some, the sad reality was that the killing of Jews would just have eventually become routine. There was also a general change from the first time they were ordered to kill: initially, the men walked their victim to the shooting area so they had to see them face-to-face and could even have conversations with them; after, they tended to be stationed at a killing pit and would shoot whatever Jews were lined up so there was no connection made between the killer and the victims. There was also the sense that no one wanted to be the one to speak out and differentiate themselves from the rest of the group. The men who did this tended to be labelled as cowards and thought of as weak. The men left doing the killing may have viewed these men as thinking they were too good to take part in it, thus leaving the dirty work for the rest. Also, it was much more acceptable to take part and then refuse because one couldn't continue, rather than outright not taking part. The men were a group and perhaps many did not want to separate themselves from it.One of my favourite things about the book was actually the afterword. Here, Browning addresses the criticisms Daniel Goldhagen made of this book in his own, Hitler's Willing Executioners. Now, I haven't actually read Goldhagen's book yet, but from what I've gathered about its content and what reviews have had to stay, it certainly is very flawed. Browning is able to address the criticisms and point out what he sees as errors in Goldhagen's book without coming off as an asshole about it (very academic wording, I know). What I think it comes down to is that Goldhagen makes generalizations (as in not differentiating between Germans) and refuses to accept the factors that Browning presented as to why most of these men did not refuse to take part in the killings. Browning points out that Goldhagen makes excuses and gives reasons as to why some Eastern Europeans willingly took part in the Holocaust but completely ignores these factors for Germans. If Browning can't make generalizations about a group of around 500 men, there's no way Goldhagen can do it for tens of millions of people. That's simply ludicrous. These men are still human beings and ones placed under a terrible set of circumstances, and the complexity of this needs to be addressed. With that being said, acknowledging the possible reasons as to why they participated or why they didn't does not mean making excuses for their actions, obviously.I think it's very easy to read this book and be shocked that more men did not object to the killings, especially knowing they would not have been punished for doing so. I think it's also very easy to read it and think to yourself, 'well, if that were me of course I would have said no!' But this is not the correct way to think about it and based on Browning's findings, most people in fact would not have objected. And that is the very sad truth. I can't go into every reason or possible reason Browning gives for the men's participation but I think he does an excellent job at attempting to explain the behaviour of the men of Reserve Police Battalion 101. He acknowledges the complexity of these circumstances and the factors that influence their behaviour without making excuses. The book is very well-written and highly recommended to anyone interested in World War II, the Holocaust or history in general."

Ich kann Mr. Browning nur dankbar dafür sein, dass er allen Pathos herauslässt bei diesem Thema, und dass er gar nicht versucht, eine tiefe Immersion zu seinen beschriebenen Personen zu entwickeln. Gleichwohl macht er die unterschiedliche Motive und Handlung verständlich und menschlich genug, und dadurch bleibt seine Warnung, dass wir alle diese ganz gewöhnlichen Männer sein können, die Teil von Mord und Totschlag werden, umso deutlicher im Raum.Ein wichtiges Werk."

But as numbers swelled on the trains and in the camps, they were tasked with exterminating Jewish men, women, and children.The soldiers of RPB 101 were initially horrified by their orders, but they complied, despite the ability to decline per their commanding officer.

The book begins first with an extremely detailed description of the various massacres and events that were perpetrated by this group and what was intriguing was that these men were, as the title suggests, ""Ordinary Men."" The men who made up these battalions were often older individuals who may have been businessmen and through these circumstances, participated in vicious and widespread murder of Jewish populations. The end of the book dissects the various causes that lead to these ordinary individuals perpetrating such heinous crimes and delves deep into psychology and the role of anti-Semitism. I do not know any German and therefore, some of the terms were difficult to understand, but regardless this is a story that tells us that we as humans may have some very dark potentials under certain circumstances. "
137,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8882126-steven,Rating 4 out of 5,"Browning is a leading historian on the Final Solution and this is his most famous work. It's a historical portrait of a genocidal Nazi paramilitary battalion, as well as an inquiry into the nature of human evil. Browning's effort here amounts to a reminder that history isn't just a library of chronologically arranged events and stories. It's really a gigantic, seemingly endless trove of human data—a complete picture of our inner selves, of human nature, reflected through the totality of our deeds. To look into the murderous actions of a Nazi battalion is to inquire into its motivations—a historical and psychological question in one. Some of the historical minutiae Browning records can get a little dizzying, but it's a small part of a relatively short volume. The Nazis utilized a number of police forces in the 1940s to, among other things, carry out the Final Solution. This included the Reserve Police (answering to the SS), a functional paramilitary sent into Eastern Europe to exterminate the Polish Jews. Battalion 101 is one such group of Reserve Police comprised of about 500 men. Between 1942-43, these men involved themselves in the deaths of ~83,000 Jews. After briefly setting the historical scene, Browning goes into detail about what happened during the battalion's most infamous massacres in several Polish cities and towns. This is where he, by using court documents that include interviews with numerous soldiers, builds a portrait of the so called ""ordinary men"" who carried out genocide. This book was quite controversial when it came out in 1992 and generated plenty of attention, scrutiny, and backlash. The idea of Nazis being anything close to ""ordinary"" understandably rubs plenty of people the wrong way, to say the least. But what Browning is really showing here is Hannah Arendt's ""banality of evil"" in action. He's showing how easy it is for ordinary men to carry out extraordinary evil (generating banality along the way) if given the right motivations and circumstances. Those in Battalion 101 were mostly working or middle class—white collar salesmen or career craftsmen who've never killed before. They might have been perfectly fine with the notion of Jews dying or being deported, but the literal, hands-on act of killing was disorienting. Yet the war and the Final Solution needed these men to kill on an industrial scale. Browning goes into detail about the battalion's sloppy start in Poland. Killing is just harder if you have to do it yourself, especially for the first time. Some had a tough time killing the same Jews they guarded and knew in the Polish ghettos; others had trouble killing those with whom they made eye contact; still others couldn't stomach killing children. A small minority refused to kill altogether. Some even missed on purpose the first time around, but eventually had to adjust and aim properly or risk being reprimanded. Many commanders hid in their rooms/offices once the blood-letting began, despite ordering and organizing the logistics of such massacres. One even gave his soldiers a chance to step out of an extermination operation before it began. Virtually everyone was Antisemitic here to a significant extent, but even thorough Antisemites might blink at least once or twice after being ordered to murder a Jewish baby. Something in the human psyche (human nature?) forced them to pause, if only for a second. But mass extermination is about introducing elements that help overcome this normal, human inhibition against the taking of innocent lives. The less eye contact or association with victims, the easier killing became. Even better if another battalion joined in to share the daunting load. Alcohol also played a big part. Many troops committed massacres while completely sloshed. Only a totally, uninhibited psychopath would derive genuine pleasure from killing babies and other innocents. Browning assures us that there were indeed such psychopaths present, but that they weren't the norm. Most of the militiamen (and one can likely extrapolate beyond Battalion 101) simply got used to the killing, however unsavoury they found it. They behaved more or less like ""ordinary men"" who learned on the job. It's important to note that although these soldiers had a tough time pulling the trigger, the vast majority didn't mind the abstract notion of Jews being slaughtered. They found it much easier to send Jews onto trains headed towards Treblinka and other death camps, knowing full well what the destination entailed. Still, the resulting portrait isn't that of salivating Antisemites hellbent on acting out their ideological impulses via blood-lettings orgies. Rather, it's that of everyday men (Antisemites, no doubt) getting accustomed to exterminating another race one step at a time. This gradualism is much more chilling because it confirms/reveals a dimension of human nature that allows for the incremental slipping into depersonalized killing; from general normality to moral depravity. You might throw up the first time, but with some company and alcohol (and a little pressure), it gets a little easier each time. By the fourth massacre, things become routine (even if you were selling mattresses just a few months years ago). Circumstances played a role in guiding the soldiers' actions. Browning factors this into his last chapter, an essay that explicitly discusses the psychological and social motivations of these killers. He notes multiple factors: ideology, peer pressure, following orders, gradual acclimation, etc. It caps a fascinating in-depth analysis that reveals as much about history as it does about history's actors and their inner clockwork. (One scholar who took exception to this book is the historian and academic Daniel Goldhagen, who wrote an entire book trying to disprove Browning's thesis. The latter has an Afterword eloquently and systematically addressing Goldhagen's counterpoints.)"

In fact, this book advocates the view that certain factors allow a normal person to do in a group what only a psychopathic individual could. It is an important book because it gives insight into the bizarre phenomenon that ordinary people in wartime, and when given the opportunity, can do the most terrible things.The first +/- 20 pages of the book are purely historical context and only for someone with a deep interest in WW2. After these pages, the book is accessible and well written. A few events are detailed and thus explicitly described. Browning's description of what possessed the police battalion in question in Poland is of a much higher scientific level than what Goldhagen accomplished in his 'Hitler's Willing Executioners'. In this edition the author formulates his thorough criticism of Goldagen's book in an afterword."

I think the true horror displayed by the German police battalion is that their horrendous, systematic and murmurous actions are not inhumanity but humanity itself. That seemingly ordinary people in the right conditions are able to commit atrocities against their fellow man. Under dogma whether it religious, governmental or cultural anything can be justified. So, the argument is put forward is that the outlier in a group is the one able to assert moral autonomy over authority, cultural systems or peer pressure.The book itself reads like a peer reviewed journal, meticulous prose that is broken up by quotations from post-war court interrogations of police battalion members. While an important read to understand the past, I believe it to be more essential to understand current conflicts and systems where radical ideas have begun to act as the cornerstones of groups and echoed without dispute."

This was a story about ordinary men, ordinary germans, who became executioners. The blindness to authority is unreal. Ordinary people become gruesome killers when under authority and right circumstances. According to this book we all have the possibility too. I don't doubt that at all.There are horrible parts in this book: people getting drunk to be able to kill, people being able to kill children only after somebody else kills their mother first, brain parts on the uniforms after a day of executing... too horrible to comprehend. The afterword is very good and important. I think it is crucial to understand how nazism came before anti-semitism, not the other way around. All the supporters were not pure evil from scratch.

I was expecting a deeper analysis of these men and the psychological factors that allowed them to commit such atrocities, and was disappointed when I instead received a detached, academic, and statistically-based account of war crimes. There was some speculation about the reasoning behind the phenomena that took place in the battalion but even that analysis lacked the human consideration that I believe this topic requires.

The book analyzes their reactions in depth and uses both sociological and psychological arguments to explain their deeds. Explain, not excuse. The overall message is unsettling. This could happen again.The book lost me at some point as it has a lengthy chapter critiquing another author's book. While it does explain the main information, I was still confused.

Los primeros capítulos me parecen una lectura relevante en la medida en que sabemos que el Holocausto pasó, hemos visto las pelis y las series, leído las novelas, pero esto le da un toque de palpabilidad, una materialización que, francamente, me ha convertido en una persona muy infeliz y también muy informada. Por otro lado, los últimos dos capítulos le dan el enfoque analítico del científico que quiere coger esos datos y darles forma de teoría socio-psicológica, y me parece el análisis más pertinente que he leído no sólo de esta tragedia, sino también de otras, pasadas y presentes, que remedan en cierta medida su atmósfera social.

It is a very well researched book that drops you into the later days of WWII, into the lives of the men of Police Battalion 101 and the civilians they interacted with, brutalized, and murdered. The depth of research and information can slow the pace of the book at times, particularly when Browning stops the narrative to list all the officers of a particular Company, for example. This cut both ways however; as Browning listed each Company and the number of victims they claimed, the length of the passage underscored the sheer horror of the Holocaust."

This is not by any means an explanation to why ""ordinary"" men committed awful war crimes. It's such a complex question with so many answers and we'll probably never know them all.

Viktor Frankl likewise claimed that the Holocaust penetrated the deepest depths of the human soul and what emerged were humans that could behave decently and those that behaved like beasts. Ordinary Men supports these words with accounts that will make your hair stand on end.

Browning tells the story objectively, through testimonies and reports from the war. He analyzes these events from a variety of perspectives (sociological and psychological mechanisms, economic incentive, etc.) and attempts to explain how ordinary people are able to participate in acts of genocide. The vast majority of the “ordinary men” were adamantly opposed to the crimes they were committing, yet they continued murdering day after day.

I always wondered how the holocaust could happen and continue to happen. I have made a great study of it. Most books fail miserably. This one does not. Though it reads like someone’s Doctoral thesis, this is a thorough, holistic, and conclusive approach that will leave no doubt as to the answer. It is not a book for the faint of heart. In the end you will have the answer but beware of asking the question. I am not going to bother with writing an extensive review as there are 700 reviews in Goodreads alone. (Be sure to acquire the 2017 version!) After reading the first half dozen I concluded that people with writing skills far superior to my own had already done the heavy lifting. Any attempt at writing one would add nothing of value. Therefore, after my contribution I have included a review from ""Sweetwilliam"" 5-17-2017. It's a mile long and almost a book in itself, but if you are too squeamish (to read Ordinary Men) to look in the mirror at the face of a killer, read his review. These men, these ""killers"" were in fact just the Joe down the street. The big take away from this book is very simple. Anyone can be trained to be a killer. And yes, it could have easily been you, your family, or the person you respect as an outstanding citizen, as the killers and likewise just as easily the victims. And again, there are examples too well documented and numerous to even attempt to deny Americans did the same thing! (War without Mercy: Race and Power in the Pacific War) Long story short; the ORDINARY MEN were conditioned over time. (An exceedingly very simplistic summary) On the so called willing executioners: “Upon learning of the imminent massacre” said he “would in no case participate in such an action in which defenseless women and children are shot” he was reassigned. With tears streaming down his face and striking futile fists at an unmerciful sky (a decorated WW1 commander) “explaining the Battalion’s murderous assignment, he made his extraordinary offer: any of the older men who did not feel up to the task that lay before them could step out” 11 to 13 men accepted. “Almost all of them” initially “were horrified and disgusted by what they were doing” Eventually there were many more (one man killed 4 before he couldn’t continue, another stopped when ordered to kill a child) but in the end most conformed and later joined the ranks. What does this book read like? Lots of theory, evidence, and conclusions, author also cites many other scholars and their research. Author does an excellent job of explaining say cognitive dissonance and then extrapolating to = “just world phenomenon” “fundamental attribution error” etc. Watch out. The author makes it clear. You are a murderer. You just haven’t been unleashed. From “Sweetwilliam”; This is not an easy read. First, it reads like a scholarly thesis paper that someone wrote for a doctoral thesis. Second, the subject matter is awful and there are no heroes. Having said this, Christopher Browning’s Ordinary Men is an integral read for those of us trying to make sense of the Holocaust.I decided to read Browning’s book because I wanted more insight into the psyche of the monsters that were ordered to carry out Hitler’s final solution. According to Browning, for the most part, the men of Battalion 101 were just ordinary men. I read the title of the book prior to buying it so I guess I shouldn’t be surprised. Browning’s analysis is clear: These men were not SS troopers and they had not been subjected to intense indoctrination or any type of brainwashing. There were very few party members. I can only remember Browning mentioning one officer that was a former member of the Hitler youth. I believe that only a few were ever in the SS prior to deployment in Poland. They were certainly not front line troops suffering from any type of combat fatigue. In fact, they hadn’t heard a shot fired in anger and there wasn’t anything frontline about them. Browning argued that they were the dregs of the Wehrmacht and they were deemed not fit for frontline duty. Most importantly, these men didn’t even seem to harbor a grudge against the Jews. With scarce exception, they hardly seemed to enjoy their task.So why did they do it? According to Browning’s interpretation of events, they did it because they were ordered to. They knew this was wrong. The Battalion Commander, Major Trapp, was a decorated combat veteran from WWI. Trapp told the enlisted men that they could be excused if they could not take part in the firing squads and then he went to an office and bawled like a baby. I took some solace that about 14 men and one officer refused to take part in the massacre and that several men refused to continue after taking part in the initial firing squad but at the end of the day, somehow the deed was done.Future actions were easier to handle in part because the killing grew more routine. Also, the policemen found ways to farm out the killing to others. They recruited Hiwis (foreigners) to do the dirty work. This included Russian prisoners (Trawnikis) who would have starved had they not been given the option to serve the Nazis. Also, the Policemen didn’t mind loading the Jews on railcars so that they could be shipped off to a death camp where others could execute them. This was much more preferable than rounding up families and personally killing them. The worst thing was to have to kill innocent people face-to-face.The author compares and contrasts the massacres committed by the Policemen to other war crimes committed during that period By US units in the Pacific and even later in Vietnam. Browning mentions that some US units in the Pacific had boasted of taking no prisoners and that there were units that collected ears etc. However, Browning makes the point that at the time these men were under duress due to combat fatigue and they had reacted to it. These policemen, on the other hand, hadn’t heard a shot fired in anger so the policemen could certainly not use this as a mitigating factor.I also personally believe that the massacres of the Polish Jews are very different than the massacres of the Chinese citizens of Nanking. Correct me if I’m wrong, but the Japanese perpetrated massacres weren’t sanctioned by high command or the Imperial Government. I remember reading Ira Chang’s Rape of Nanking and reading one of the commanding General’s correspondence that imperial soldiers were acting like Genghis Khan. Iwane Matsui, the commanding General of IJA in China, gave strict orders not to harm Chinese citizens or loot. Ironically, Matsui was a great admirer of China and chastised his officers for what happened in Nanking but ultimately, this did not save him from the hangman’s noose. The implementation of the Final Solution in Poland was the exact opposite. The ordinary men of the reserve police battalion were ordered by Himmler at Hitler’s wishes to kill all men, women, and children and to shoot infants and the infirm on sight. These policemen certainly would not have carried out these massacres without orders to do so. However, they still did it and this bothers me.With a minimum of psychobabble, Browning tries to compare the actions of the Policemen with some University studies where students acting as prisoners were given fake shocks. I’m sorry, but some of this was lost on me. I believe it had little relevance to a reserve policemen being asked to blow a hole at point blank range through a defenseless child’s neck and getting spattered with their brains at times. To me it was a vain attempt to extrapolate data from a few college snowflakes and apply it to something like the Holocaust. The use of this data almost trivialized the Holocaust to some degree. I believe that these Jews would have preferred to have been shocked a few times or even shipped off to Abu Ghraib to live out the war forming naked pyramids.Early on in the book there is a letter from a German official trying to run the local economy in the east complaining about the implementation of what later became known as the Final Solution. The official claimed that his skilled workers at several factories either had fled or were shot or were transported to a concentration camp and how none of the remaining workers (including the White Russians) could concentrate on their jobs because family members were carted off. The implementation of the final solution made the local economy collapse at a time when Germany could least afford it. It makes one take a step back for a moment and wonder what could have been accomplished if the Germans would have used their precious resources (rolling stock, manpower etc.) trying to defeat the Russians? The Jews could have been left alone and even recruited to join the war effort. I wonder if we would all be eating sauerkraut and sausage three times a day.At the end of the day I am still not quite sure why these men went through with carrying out these orders? There were no reprisals if you didn’t take part other than peer pressure. Let us not underestimate the power of peer pressure. Would men today do the same thing if ordered? Would I have done what they did if I had been in their shoes? Would I have grabbed a machine gun and started shooting my fellow officers while yelling to the Jews in my best yiddish ""run for the hills while I hold them off?"" Probably not. I'm no Joan of Arc. I would more likely have done what Papa Trapp did. At best, I would of had the foresight to resign.As Major Trapp said during the first Jewish action “If this Jewish business is ever avenged on earth then have mercy on us Germans.” Trapp was later hanged after the war for carrying out revenge killings of Polish gentiles after a partisan action. Even this Trapp tried to mitigate. I believe the hangman’s noose may have been good medicine for a man that most likely had lived out a tortured existence knowing what he was ultimately responsible for.In my review of ""Our Crime was Being Jewish"" I said that the men and women who perpetrated the Holocaust should be hunted down and tried for these crimes until they take their last breath on earth. Christopher Browning’s research indicates all events are not that black and white. You would have to hang several ordinary men that you are probably no better than. Thank God every day that we Americans currently live under a different set of circumstances.Judging others is never that easy. "

""Ordinary Men"" sifts through trial transcripts, interviews, and Nazi orders to tell the story of how ordinary, average, middle-age, German men killed thousand, upon thousands of people.A short, but well researched book you'll probably find yourself taking your time to move through it. Reading about massacre, after massacre takes its toll. Christopher Browning let's the readers see how actually doing the murdering also took it's toll on many of the men in Battalion 101. I don't think that this view of the murderers as human who suffered (to a far less degree than their victims) lets them off the hook. Instead I feel that it serves as a warning. A warning that it can happen anywhere, and that vigilance and resistance to authoritarianism are requisite. As an aside, while reading the afterward I found many of Browning's descriptions of the rise of Nazism to disturbingly match the writing of Rosa Brooks in ""How Everything Became War and the Military Became Everything."" Namely that the steady usurping of the responsibilities of civil institutions by the military undermine democracy. While not the main thrust of ""Ordinary Men"" it was a corollary that rang with me while I was finishing the book."

I appreciated Browning's understanding of the task he undertook. He knew his perspective would be difficult to understand, and he delivered it with that in mind at all times. I actually read this in the same class that I read Hannah Arendt's ""The Trial of Adolf Eichmann: The Banality of Evil,"" and I think they both paired very well together (though they seem to disagree slightly on the role of Jewish Councils) in their view of the Holocaust as not an act of inhumanity but an act only humans, in all of their sensibilities and susceptibilities could ever be capable of. Terrifying. I will say that I absolutely hated the organization of this book. It felt like chapters had no distinguishable pattern -- no groupings of themes, chronology, perspective.

That to be treated like an animal meant to be stuffed into cattle trains so full that you couldn’t even move, during August’s summer heat, and then to be transported for 3 days without food or water. After 3 days, when the Germans opened the sealed wagons, the stench made people vomit.I’d recommend this book to anyone who is interested in understanding how the holocaust was carried out and how ordinary, middle-class men could become cold-hearted killers."

If you are looking to familiarize yourself with the horrible banality of evil, then this book is exposure therapy. It will cure you of any delusion about the capacity to become a smonster. If you are looking for the emotional impact of evil, or any emotion at all, this book will disappoint. Some words;What to say about this book depends on what you believe its purpose to be. It is painstakingly referenced and professional presented as a document of history. But is that the purpose of a book like this. If the goal is simply getting the history right, why not read the court documents it is based off. Why would I read this book. It certainly isn't for pleasure. It isn't even for the history. I know the Nazi party were murderous and the Holocaust was a nightmare. I am looking for insight into evil. Hopefully I am trying to achieve some inoculation from my own evil, by exposing myself to some of theirs. This is the best I could hope for, at worst I came for voyeurism. To gawk at the horror, safe in my bed. As a person can never evaluate their own motives I hope at least I fall in the middle of the two. I came looking for the why, and found only the how. I commend the author in trying to resist the desire to psychologize his subjects, be they predator or pray. He presents the story as devoid of exsaggeration and speculation as possible. In this he is also devoid of any sense of outrage, terror or feeling in general. We have two heart reching stories presented simultatiously. The first the murder of 83,000 people by a detachment of 500 men in the span of a few years. The second is the corruptions of what appeared to be otherwise decent police men prior to the war and there reintergration into society with little or no punishment. Browning spends the first half of the book with the most painstakingly detailed description of the murder of hundreds of people per day in a orderly and systematic way. He writes this like ikea instructions. How to kill lots of people; insert tab A into slot B, bury, repeat. I found myself drifting away from the report because it was so without human details. There was much discussion about the logistics of stacking bodies, and wading through ankle deep rivers of blood, but little recognition of the human tragedy of corruption and death. I feel the author missed the oppurtunity to teach and tell a story of how close we all are to becoming evil, or the victiums of evil. Precious little seperates me from the murders or the murdered in this tale. I would like to point to an objective difference between these men and me, that would comfort me into believing I am some how immune to ending up on either side of firing line, but I cannot see one. They worked, and I work. They had families, I have a family. They were not particularly political, I am not particulary political. They were not even strongly antisematic, almost non were members of the nazi party. They were caught up in the river of history, and so am I."

It's extremely emotionally taxing for me and even though I know what I'm getting myself into, I'm rarely prepared for the accounts of events that went on during WWII.

God help me, I don't know if I'm gonna make it through this book. Chapter 3: The action began as a pogrom: beating, humiliation, beard burning, and shooting at will as the policemen drove Jews to the marketplace or synagogue. When several Jewish leaders appeared at the headquarters of the 221st Security Division of General Pflugbeil and knelt at his feet, begging for army protection, one member of Police Battalion 309 unzipped his fly and urinated on them while the general turned his back.My emotions are all over the place--upset, angry, horrified... It makes me want to dig these assholes up and torture them to death all over again--fucking monsters. 2. The battalion and company commanders are especially to provide for the spiritual care of the men who participate in this action. The impressions of the day are to be blotted out through the holding of social events in the evenings. Furthermore the men are to be instructed continuously about the political necessity of the measures. Yes, distract your officers with parties in the evenings, that'll surely take their minds off the mass graves they had to dig, fill, and then hide. How is that ""spiritual care"" exactly? And let's not forget, the required, healthy dose of indoctrination!The captain . . . explained that he had received instructions from the commander to make the city free of Jews without exception. . .MAKE THE CITY FREE OF JEWS are you fucking kidding me? As if they're just herding them off into the wild blue yonder.I was not present at the shootings outside the city. Thus I can say nothing about the brutality. But it suffices when I emphasize that long after being thrown in the grave, some of those shot worked their way out again.Oh my good God. Can you fucking imagine being buried in a mass grave while you're still alive?! Lying there on top of (or under!!!) your dead brothers and sisters, parents, children, friends.... and then having to dig your way out again? What a goddamned nightmare.Chapter 5: The company recreation room was decorated with racist slogans, and a Star of David hung above the bar. A mark was made on the bar door for each Jew shot, and ""victory celebrations"" were reportedly held on days when high scores were recorded.I'm sorry, did they think they were at the arcade? This is fucking disgusting. The men of Reserve Police Battalion 101 were from the lower orders of German society. They had experienced neither social nor geographic mobility. Very few were economically independent. Except for apprenticeship or vocational training, Virtually none had any education after leaving Volksschule (terminal secondary school) at age fourteen or fifteen.Are we surprised that the majority of these men are lower class, lesser-educated people with no chance of ""leveling up"" in life? They're poor and stupid. Just like the government likes them--easy to manipulate. Chapter 7: Horrific doesn't begin to describe this chapter. It's gruesome in its details. Don't be eating when you read this, it WILL turn your stomach. All the trigger warnings. All of them. Trapp, by most accounts, was deeply unsettled by these orders, even as he gave them to his company men. He spent the majority of his day locked away in his 'office' bawling like a baby. His men resented this (and rightly so... you can pass out these orders and expect them to be followed but can't participate in them yourself?)In the recounts many of the men disliked the task given to them. Many knew it was wrong and made any excuse (wasting time looting, hiding, claiming they were ""weak of constitution"", etc) to get out of being on the firing squads. But neither the drink nor Trapp's consolation could wash away the sense of shame and horror that pervaded the barracks.I should fucking think not. Chapter 8: The Jews stood outside their circle of human obligation and responsibility. Such a polarization between ""us"" and ""them,"" between one's comrades and the enemy, is of course standard in war.Just think for a moment about what's happening in our world today. Think about how groups are being polarized. By race, by political party, by gender/identity. We're back on that level: ""us"" versus ""them"". That should terrify all of us. Chapter 13: Uniformly, Hoffmann's men offered a different perspective. By their observation his ""alleged"" bouts of stomach cramps, confining him safely to bed, coincided all too consistently with company actions that might involve either unpleasantness or danger. It became common for the men to predict, upon hearing the night before of a pending action, that the company chief would be bedridden by morning.If the leaders are openly cowardly, WHY do these men continue to follow their orders?Chapter 16: All these officers getting 5 or 6 years in jail after slaughtering hundreds of thousands of innocent men, women and children is the most absurd bullshit. Nevermind the other 200 men who were in the battalion and who carried out the orders these asshats gave to them. They should have been walked out into the woods, stripped naked, made to crawl around while they were whipped and beaten, then lined up and shot through the neck. Then dumped into a pit and fucking forgotten about. Chapter 18: War, and especially race war, leads to brutalization, which leads to atrocity.It's not just a Nazi thing. Americans are guilty of it, Asians are guilty of it... any war where 2 sides are divided by race looks the exact same. War, a struggle between ""our people"" and ""the enemy,"" creates a polarized world in which ""the enemy"" is easily objectified and removed from the community of human obligation. War is the most conducive environment in which governments can adopt ""atrocity by policy"" and encounter few difficulties in implementing it.Woof. This is something we desperately need to keep in mind given the current state of our world. Our government doesn't give a fuck about us, and it will have no problem 'putting us down'. And now we see that those ""policy followers"" will do it, even if on an individual level, they might abhor the thought of killing innocents.  This book takes its time getting to the point. But even when it's faffing on about other military and police units and the atrocities they committed in different parts of Europe, the horrific accounts provided all serve a purpose. They all help to build a bigger picture of the world the men of the 101st battalion were living in and the regime they operated under. As Browning stated in the forward: ""Explaining is not excusing; understanding is not forgiving."" After reading this book, there's no way I could forgive what these men did. There's a special place in Hell for each and every one of them and I hope they are suffering. But this book has opened my eyes to a horrific truth--human nature is frighteningly manipulable. Importantly, we'd all do well to remember this fact: It is entirely possible to turn an average every day human being into a demented, murderous psychopath, given enough time and enough pressure. "
204,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13674690-philip,Rating 4 out of 5,"Perhaps the most harrowing book I have ever read. The book explores in much detail the psychology of ordinary German men serving in public order police units who participated in the mass execution of Jewish men, women, children and babies in the height of the mass extermination of Jews in the mid 1940's. The book draws heavily on the body of evidence available regarding a particular police battalion, the majority of whom were drawn from Hamburg with officers from Austria deployed to Poland and the Eastern Front. At the outset they were in mass killings in particular villages in which they would murder thousands of Jewish people in a single event but later in the mass house by house clearing operations were they loaded entire towns into trains shooting the sick, elderly and small children immediately and then later in the ""Jew Hunts"" in the surrounding forests to kill those hiding there. The book reveals that a minority of men and ever some officers refused to participate in the activities and the manner in which they were discreetly excused serves to highlight that the officers were deeply aware that even by the standards of Nazi Germany many of these actions were completely beyond the boundaries of even laws under Hitler. The book describes the role that alcohol played but does not explore the role of widely available meth amphetamines in these actions. While it explores in great detail the willingness of these family men (in certain bizarre instances even in the presence of their wives) from a reserve unit (not SS or regular security police) to participate in these inhuman activities, it does not explore why the Hiwis (men recruited from prison of war camps of mainly Lithuanian, Latvian, Ukrainian origins) very often carried out the mass killings with great efficiency and enthusiasm when the morale of the German police units collapsed. This book asks extremely important questions about the ability of ordinary men and women to commit the most horrific acts of mass murder. It also raises deeply uncomfortable questions about power relations and how a couple of dozen policemen were able to secure the passive and compliant acceptance by over thousands of Jewish victims in the systematic execution."
205,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30511565-liz-polding,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is an outstanding and scholarly book, but its conclusions are very disturbing. The banality of evil has been widely discussed in psychology and philosophy and the text examines this in some detail and considers the work of other historians in relation to the same area. We need people who have done terrible things to be different from us and it is hard not to look for (and find, somehow) evidence that they are. The author clearly understands this and as part of his analysis, he considers some prominent psychological data on the reactions of ordinary people to circumstances where they are required to do things that they might otherwise find unacceptable.The book relates the facts - 500 men responsible for the deaths of some 83,000 - in some detail and tells the stories of some of those who could be identified and who were involved in the killing. The commanding officer of what was essentially a civilian police squad is considered in particular detail. He offered his men a choice as to whether they were willing to participate in the genocide and protected them if they refused. Several did, either initially or later, having been revolted by what they were asked to do. And it is revolting. The author does not spare the reader and nor should he. The cold blooded murder of unarmed civilians, including children, is beyond revolting. And yet they did it. Why?The author's arguments and conclusions are well-reasoned and I will not set them out here. They are an example of how historical and scientific research ought to be carried out and presented, focusing on the examination of evidence, not the selection of what supports the hypothesis and the suppression of what does not. I fear that the author is right in his conclusions - and certainly his arguments are compelling- that any ordinary person could, potentially, act as the officers did. Somehow the events of this book would be less horrifying if they were isolated and explicable by a unique set of circumstances and a unique set of individuals. Unfortunately events in The Balkans, Rwanda and the Middle East suggest that they cannot be explained in this way. I wish that it were otherwise."

This is an interesting look at a subset of this population. As a book for the mass market, however, there is inevitable repetitiveness (as the same threads and experiences recur among the study's subjects), and the author's conclusions are probably too vaguely presented to be retained by a non-academic audience. It is well-organized and clearly written, and will be worth the time spent reading for many."
207,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2490942-david,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book seeks to explain how seemingly ordinary men could become accomplices in genocide. The author studied extensive historic documentation describing the actions of Reserve Police Battalion 101 during WWII, operating under the leadership of the Nazi SS. This battalion alone (but only one of 13) was responsible for the execution of some 83,000 Jews. The first half of the book discusses the series of murderous events in graphic detail—the shooting of men, women, and children (yes, they shot children.) It was hard just to read these descriptions, and at times I considered abandoning the book. It cited incident after incident of how the perpetrators and victims behaved. Some of the perpetrators participated without reservation, some reluctantly, while a small number refused. But the book became more intellectually engaging and purposeful in the second half when the author explored the psychology that drove ordinary men into becoming executioners. One is compelled to wonder—if subjected to the same circumstances, could I have been one of them?The author surveys the theories of several experts in the field of genocide, German history, and social psychology. And there are surprisingly many, too many to summarize here, but all are fascinating in their own regard. Here’s a short description of the more compelling ones. Many studies suggest that Nazi killers were violence-prone people attracted to authoritarianism. Theodor Adorno developed the F scale, which identifies traits of an authoritarian personality. Sigmund Bauman summed up how this came into play: “Nazism was cruel because Nazis were cruel; and Nazis were cruel because cruel people tended to become Nazis.” John Steiner proposed the notion of the sleeper, a violence-prone individual that usually remains latent, but can be activated under certain conditions. In the chaos of post-WWI Germany, people testing high on the F scale were attracted to national socialism as a subculture of violence, and to the SS which provided the incentives and support for the full realization of their violent potential. After WWII, such men reverted to law-abiding behavior. Thus, Steiner concludes that political circumstances and indoctrination by the SS had the effect of awakening the sleeper. Phillip Zimbardo conducted an experiment that simulated prison circumstances with subjects randomly assigned as either guards or prisoners. He screened out those who scored high on the F scale. Still, within six days, the inherent structure of prison life produced rapidly escalating brutality, humiliation, and dehumanization among the guards. “Most dramatic and distressing to us was the observation of the ease with which sadistic behavior could be elicited in individuals who were not sadistic types.” The prison situation alone, Zimbardo concluded, was a sufficient condition to produce aberrant, antisocial behavior among about a third of the guards, a similar proportion of willing and eager executioners in Reserve Police Battalion 101. The infamous Milgram experiments tested the individual’s ability to resist authority. Naive volunteer subjects were instructed by a “scientific authority” in an alleged learning experiment to inflict an escalating series of fake electric shocks upon an actor-victim, who responded with carefully programmed voice feedback—an escalating series of complaints, cries of pain, calls for help, and finally, fateful silence. In the standard voice feedback experiment, two-thirds of Milgram's subjects were obedient to the point of inflicting extreme pain. If a non-authority figure gave orders, obedience was nil. If the naive subject performed subsidiary or accessory tasks, but did not personally inflict the electric shocks, obedience was nearly total. Milgram proposed that an evolutionary bias favors the survival of people who can adapt to hierarchical situations and organized social activity. Socialization through family, school, and military service, as well as a whole array of rewards and punishments within society, reinforces and internalizes a tendency toward obedience. The notions of loyalty, duty, and discipline, requiring competent performance in the eyes of authority, become moral imperatives that override any identification with the victim. Normal individuals enter an agentic state in which they are the instrument of another's will. In such a state, they no longer feel personally responsible for their actions, only for how well they are performed. A situational obligation or etiquette makes refusal appear improper, rude, or even an immoral breach of obligation. However, Milgram speculated that it is not authority that motivates behavior as much as conformity—how you look in the eyes of your peers. Also, ideological justification (transmitted by the authority) is vital in obtaining willing obedience, for it permits a person to see his behavior as serving a desirable end. In Nazi Germany, there was intense indoctrination through propaganda. And many of Milgram’s insights find graphic confirmation in the behavior and testimony of the men of Reserve Police Battalion 101. How much of the massacre of Jews was motived primarily by anti-Semitism and how did Germany become so verdantly anti-Semitic? Shulamit Volkov interpreted German anti-Semitism as a cultural code associated with German conservatism. Emerging historically from an imperialistic authoritarian state tradition, conservative Germans felt threatened by modernization and associated anti-Semitism with what they felt threatened by. Volkov concluded that anti-Semitism became increasingly inseparable from anti-modernism and, in this respect, most people were drawn to anti-Semitism because they were drawn to Nazism, not the other way around. Though differing in some ways, most scholars agree that any attempt to explain the motivation of the killers must be complex and multifaceted, not monocausal. They combine and synthesize situational and dispositional with cultural and ideological factors, rather than oppose them in a false dichotomy. But for all the explanations offered in the book as to how ordinary men become complicit with mass murder, there are no solutions suggested—not one antidote, not one test to detect the germination of a seed of genocide or its indoctrination and subtle acceptance in society. We can speak much about how ordinary men acquiesce to evil deeds, but nothing about how to detect and inoculate men from the sickness. This book was published in 1992. In 2023, some would say that authoritarianism has grown and that its expression through violence is an increasing threat. While authoritarians and authoritarian sympathizers are a minority, it is sobering to recall that Nazis came to power as a minority, never acquiring more than 37% of the vote in a free election. So while there are no definitive answers in this book, there is one solid takeaway: be afraid."

Essentially, that is the theme of the historical review of a German reserve police battalion from WWII. Much of the records from this group were provided in the years after WWII thru interviews from the members themselves though there were also witness statements about the events they participated in. 10 to 20% of the men refused or asked for other jobs when they were ordered to execute Jews. Few relished the role. Most, just did it as their grim and terrible duty as they shot hundreds of people one by one on several occasions. A quote from the book that I think captures the beginning of this analysis well: ""The battalion had orders to kill Jews, but each individual did not. Yet 80 to 90 percent of the men proceeded to kill, though almost all of them-at least initially-were horrified and disgusted by what they were doing. To break ranks and step out, to adopt overtly nonconformist behavior, was simply beyond most men. It was easier for them to shoot. Why? First of all, by breaking ranks, nonshooters were leaving the ""dirty work"" to their comrades. Since the battalion had to shoot even if individuals did not, refusing to shoot constituted refusing one's share of an unpleasant collective obligation. It was in effect an asocial act vis-à-vis one's comrades. Those who did not shoot risked isolation, rejection, and ostracism-a very uncomfortable prospect within the framework of a tight-nit unit station abroad among a hostile population, so that the individual had nowhere else to turn for support and social contact.""

Especially the last chapters are worth your while because Browning meets one of his strongest critics, Daniel Goldhagen, head-on and completely unravels the latter's monocausal explanation of why it is that ordinary German men wound up to be the perpetrators of such extraordinarily gruesome crimes. It is hard not to agree with Browning that, contrary to Goldhagen's beliefs, it was not predominantly anti-semitism that led this battalion to inflict atrocities upon the Jews but more plain and, this is the unnerving bit, ultimately human characteristics like the inclination to group conformity and solidarity, the inclination to obey a powerful authority, and even the simple fear of punishment and sober career-mindedness. Goldhagen and his adepts have long held the idea that German Jew-slayers were all very ardent executioners but the dire reality is that most of these ""policemen"" did not enjoy their nasty work. Their responsibility and culpability for those crimes of course is an entirely different matter. All these policemen in the end still had a choice to make, there were those few heroes who managed to resist to peer pressure and loss of face and managed to refrain from all the gore and ghastliness.

Yes, there is a very dark side to humanity that can be awakened among, I believe, all of us.To simply say ""Hitler caused the Holocaust"" may allow some people to ignore their own capacity for atrocity.

Christopher Browning provides some tentative answers to why members of the Reserve Police Battalion 101 who were probably the least apt candidates for aiding in the perpetration of the Holocaust, nevertheless took part in the shooting deaths of some 36,000 Jews and the deportation of roughly 88,000. It's a short read and Browning's writing is very accessible. He cannot reach a neat conclusion for why these men took part in the Final Solution but attributes their behavior to a variety of factors including the mutually reinforcing relationship between war and racism and the intensifying effects of wartime propaganda and indoctrination. He also suggests that the men's impulses to conform with group behavior—to not appear cowardly—may have contributed to some of their actions. Nevertheless, some soldiers refused outright to kill and others refused to continue after the killings began. He concludes that ""human responsibility is an individual matter"" and that the men he studies represented a wide spectrum of reactions to wanton violence—some became eager killers, others reluctantly killed out of obedience to orders and expressed occasional moments of pity (which did not absolve their complicity and participation), while still others absolutely refused to take part. Raises some interesting and enduring questions about how the Holocaust happened and what factors can lead men toward unspeakable acts of violence."

Be very afraid that you and your children are being conditioned to re-enact the horrors related here. Although I wholeheartedly recommend this study of the people in the Third Reich I must point out that this study of human nature completely misses the one great hope for any civilization, namely, the counter balance of the church. In the book there is not one reference to consideration of the moral religious values internalized in anyone. That the most enthusiastic Nazis were totally immoral is a given. But what influence did Christian faith have on the refusers? The bleak picture of the “Ordinary Men” studied here predicts our present descent into a racist Fourth Reich. But this time the “privileged white male” is the new Jew. I believe that further study that shows the influence of the church can go a long way to revive hope.

Browning provides an intimate portrait of a unit's actions in the Holocaust and its descent from shocked disbelief to relative murderous efficiency. The over-arching argument is a modified Milgram experiment, in which obedience to authority, supported by conformity and ideology, will make nearly everyone a murderer. Browning believes this destroys not responsibility but our belief in moral absolutes. The victims of the camps enacted their own horrors on each other. The men of Reserve Police Battalion 101 were often overwhelmed and tried to avoid doing the work. One thing I think could be better explored is how conformity creates these situations. The same things that endear me to others also create ""others"" that can be destroyed.I have to agree with Browning. Men can be made into killers with more ease than I feel comfortable with. America, circa 2017, is riven with factionalism and hatred for the ""other"" often wrapped in moral superiority. I fear no matter who wins, right or left, a lot of people are going to die for the ""greater good.""Lastly, this book reminded me of Noah Cross in Chinatown: ""I don't blame myself.

The reserve police battalion consisted of apparently average and normal people, and yet 400 out of 500 of them went on to commit mass murders and terrible atrocities. The author did his best to reconstruct the order of events that took place mainly in the summer of 1942 in Poland. He describes the events that took place based on the testimony of the people which participated in it. It's not an easy read. Some of the descriptions include killing children and rationalizing it as relieving them of the pain to live without their mothers. Others include mass killings where some Jewish people have to line up and see the 3 meters graves full of their relatives before being killed. In the end, the author attempts to rationalize the behavior of these people? Was it conformity, indoctrination or pure evil that caused normal people to behave like the devil. Comparing it to the Milgrams Standford prison experiment, did the people simply conform to their socially prescribed role? Our evolution has trained us to respect authority, but does it overpower our individual responsibility? It is evident many aspects contributed to their actions, but at the end even if we can understand their reasons, we would still expect their humility to overpower all of their influences.

What Browning does is to tell us that these people were human just as the rest of us, and then shows us the transformation of these men into the killers they eventually become. Showing what happened along the way and how the human part in these people was unsettled by and later sedated/desensitized towards the act of killing that they were undertaking. This approach is a questioning of the standing approach to the Nazis as simple mindless monsters bent on world domination and the destruction of ""non-Aryan"" peoples. It instead demonstrates that these ""monsters"" were as much as human as the innocents they killed, and that their psyches are much more complex and deserving of attention that the simplistic shrug-off the mainstream approach affords it. I am also of the opinion that this book bridges together the private and public lives of its subjects, which sets it apart from the other works which only concentrate on public images and development.

Browning shows that they were ordinary men - not unusually violent or anti-Semetic. At first they killed with reluctance. But due to peer pressure, the desensitization to violence, and other factors, they all participated in murders.One lesson I took away was to allow no internal negotiations with evil. Perhaps 10-20% of the battalion was uncomfortable with the murders, and strove to avoid participating whenever possible. However, they did nothing to try to stop them. Instead they were assigned other roles, such as finding Jews, and reasoned that acting in those capacities were fine, since they were only assisting and not actually pulling the trigger. Guarding the prisoners seemed fine in comparison with a place on a firing squad, even though they were still fully participating in the atrocities.""There but for the grace of God go I."""

They never talked about it, even amongst themselves, but in 1962 they finally broke their silence. In Ordinary Men, Christopher Browning, a world-renowned Holocaust expert, attempts to answer the question of why did most men in Reserve Police battalion 101 become killers, while only a minority of around 10 percent – and no more than 20 percent – did not (159)? Taking a different approach from most Holocaust studies, Browning looks at the men behind the mass murder from a personal level. This study, conducted in the 1960s by the Office of the State Prosecutor in Hamburg depend upon the judicial interrogations of around 125 men from Reserve Police Battalion 101 (xvii). Browning supplements the interrogations with documents from the German and Israeli archives, along with a handful of Jewish survivor testimonies. By turning attention away from the victims and focusing on the perpetrators of these heinous crimes, the author gets to the core of how men can easily transition from good to evil and the mental challenges that accompany such a drastic shift. 	The men of Reserve Police Battalion 101 were what Browning describes as family men of working and lower-middle-class background. Most were from Hamburg, and all were considered too old for German army service, so they drafted them to the Order Police. Sent to Poland as part of the Final Solution; their job was the unenviable task of clearing Jewish ghettos and liquidating the Jewish population. Browning makes it clear that most of these men, minus a handful who served in World War I, had never killed another human being. Using testimonies of the policemen, Browning reconstructed the timeline of events as well as the words of the Battalion's leadership before and after clearing operations. In the summer of 1942, the Police Battalion was assigned to clear the Józefow, Poland ghetto, under the command of Major Trapp; their mission was to clear the ghetto and liquidate the Jews of the city. Before the shooting began, Trapp allowed anyone who did not feel up to the task of killing Jews to step aside, only a dozen men accepted his offer. On July 12, 1942, the men of Reserve Police Battalion 101 massacred over 1,500 Jews. Browning details the emotions of the men, how they wish they had stepped out of formation when given a chance, how they stepped out of the firing line to weep and smoke cigarettes, and the toll the first taste of murder took on them mentally and physically.	During interrogations twenty-five years later, most of the interrogated policemen alleged that they were deprived of a choice in the killing and believed that if they had stepped out of formation when given a chance they would have been seen as ""weak"" or ""cowardly"" (72). Many of the policemen admit to shooting Jews, but after several iterations asked for permission to leave the firing squad because they felt sick or could not continue with the task. The shooting at Józefow lasted from before sunrise until darkness fell (69). In the days following the massacre, Browning details the mentality of the men as they tried to forget the slaughter they had committed. Many of the men drank heavily and did not talk about the shooting; it became taboo to discuss it, even amongst each other. Browning says the men who walked away from the shooting, even twenty-five years later, overwhelmingly cited sheer revulsion against shooting Jews as their reason for quitting (74). The leadership of the men was mostly supportive of those who refused to shoot, or shot and then quit. Reports say that Major Trapp, the commander of Reserve Police Battalion 101, spent much of his time crying because of the absolute horror of what he witnessed.	Christopher Browning does a fantastic job of extracting the emotional state of the policemen and telling their story. He gets inside of their heads and looks at them not as monsters who committed perhaps the worst atrocity of modern times, but as fathers, husbands, and brothers. Browning understands that these are, in fact, ordinary men who were put in a terrible situation. However, it should be noted that some men were not as forthcoming as others due to their innate survival instinct. These men were under interrogation for heinous crimes, and faced years in prison, self-preservation meant not divulging all aspects of their crimes, especially the most monstrous. As the mission of ghetto clearing and mass murder continued, the Order Police became more accustomed to their role as killers. It is at this point in the book that Browning begins to conjecture about how these men became killers; he compares them to American soldiers fighting in the Pacific who brutalized Japanese, and also Japanese soldiers who rampaged through Manila. Browning speaks of the ""battlefield frenzy"" for the other atrocities, but claims that was not the case for the German police because they were not exposed to the battlefield, but instead committed their atrocities far from the front lines. The author never really gets to a consensus about how and why eighty to ninety percent of the Battalion became comfortable with killing. By the end of 1943, the same men who had such a hard time killing Jews in Józefow committed the largest massacre against Jews in the war called the harvest festival (Erntefest) in which 42,000 Jews were massacred (135). These men also became extremely proficient at what they called the ""Jew hunt,"" in which they tracked down Jews who had escaped and were hiding in the forests of Poland. The order from the Nazi headquarters was the make Poland Judenfrei (Jew-free), and Reserve Police Battalion 101 was on the frontline of that effort. The men seemed to enjoy their Jew hunts and prided themselves on finding and killing Jews. 	Browning does a superb job of telling a story that needs to be told to get a diverse perceptive of the brutality perpetrated on Polish Jews. Ordinary men begins somewhat abruptly with the characters involved in the hierarchy of the Nazi regime. Browning assumes that the reader already knows who Heinrich Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich are, and he also assumes much of the background leading up to the Final Solution. The scope of the book is pretty much right on the mark, with the one exception of perhaps giving a little more background information on some key players. The sources used in Ordinary Men give the book a unique outlook; Browning believes that the interrogations of the men from Reserve Police Battalion 101… constitute the “prime” and “indispensable” source for this study. Although the investigations did not lead to indictments, the interrogations offered valuable insight into the minds of ordinary men turned killers. After the war, the men of the Battalion went back to their normal lives; many chose to remain in the police force. In concluding his book, Browning claims that most men, if put in a similar situation as the men of Reserve Police Battalion 101, would make the same decision to kill. The collective behavior of these men is due to the societal condition of respect and deferment to authority; when the order to kill is given from the top, that is what is done. 	An extensive effort was undertaken to compile data, interviews, interrogations from the Office of the State Prosecutor in Hamburg, and other documents from the German and Israeli archives is skillfully executed by Christopher Browning. His expertise in the subject shines through on every page. He writes from a position of wisdom that can only be obtained from several decades of intense study. The problem of this work is that a Holocaust expert undertakes the role of a psychologist. Once he begins to speculate the inner working of the minds of the men of Reserve Police Battalion 101, he begins to get off-topic and goes into a tailspin of comparisons between the atrocities they committed and the atrocities of others. If Browning had consulted an actual psychologist, that would have made his analysis more credible. By the end of the book, Browning finds his footing again and finishes on a strong note. The unique perspective given to this often talked about subject is very much welcome as part of the discussion on the Holocaust. The men of the Battalion, even twenty to twenty-five years later, could not forget the horrendous undertaking of their task. These men give emotional and in-depth accounts of their crimes, which Browning translates from German to English and describes perfectly for consumption by a new generation eager to gain a bottom-up approach to history. Ordinary Men is a must-read book for anyone interested in the Holocaust and World War II. "

221,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/115677-justin,Rating 4 out of 5,"As his title suggest, Christopher Browning's book is an exploration of the ordinary men involved in the Holocaust. Examining the actions of Reserve Police Battalion 101, a police unit stationed in Poland and Eastern Europe during World War 2, a unit responsible for the deaths of an estimated 80,000 men, women, and children. Rather than focusing on the party leaders and the masterminds of the Final Solution, Browning looks at the men of the battalion, reconstructing their actions from testimony given to German police following the war and the denazification of Germany. Relying heavily on the experiments of Phillip Zimbardo and Stanley Milgram, who both explored the limits of obedience in your average citizen, Browning concludes that the men who carried out the Final Solution were not sociopathic monsters, but were regular men who, for a number of reasons, gave up their humanity and willing murdered their fellow man. Seeking to explain rather than excuse, Browning's book is a chilling example of the cruelty and inhumanity of man."

The battalion was assigned to occupy Poland. The mens jobs were to clear out ghetto’s, and sometimes to perform mass murders of Jewish people. These killings were only a “small” contribution to the Final Solution in Poland. The book follows how the men of Reserve Police Battalion 101 transform from average working-class men, to brutal killers.I can honestly say that this is one of the most boringly written books I’ve ever even attempted to read. I would say that it was definitely written strictly just to inform people about the events, and not to really tell any specific stories within the events. It is very repetitive. In pretty much every chapter, the same thing happens, just in a different location in Poland. I would give this book a 1 out of 5. I gave it this rating, because it is just awfully written, and very boring. I would only suggest reading this book if you really wanted to learn about the Final Solution. "
223,no user info,Rating 3 out of 5,"Not easy or fun to read, but a book with an important lesson. I had hoped for a story, described from one or maybe several personal perspectives. However, this is really more of a study of the psychology, and a chronological narration with possibly thousands of facts (with references), of how Germany's execution of Hitler's Final Solution progressed in Poland.There are two central subjects. Firstly, the story of Reserve Police Battalion 101, who they were and what they did. Secondly, the author's detailed analysis and opinions on the psychology: how can so many people commit such heinous crimes, were they just following orders?I found the author's conclusion best part of the book. The previous owner of my copy must have thought the same thing, since tens of paragraphs were highlighted here."

This is praise in itself to it's accuracy but ensures that fewer people will trudge through it.Upon reflection this tediousness might have achieved the unwanted positive effect of mirroring a small part of how desk killers felt. During the first few chapters, I felt sadness and awe at every documented number of Jews killed but as the chapters went on, the numbers rolled into one and no longer impressed. This detachedness from such horrific statistics is chilling upon self reflection.3 stars would have been my final review but the final essay discussing the various historians theories and scientists' experiments, elevated the whole book to a 4 star review.May we never forget how easy it is to say yes...

229,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/98886727-c-paulin,Rating 4 out of 5,"Christopher Browning’s Ordinary Men offers disturbing insight into the men of Reserve Police Battalion 101 (RPB101). Browning argues that they were not specially selected killers but human beings who represented a regular cross-section of German society — the titular ordinary men. Published in 1992, the book’s genesis lay in Browning’s attempt to reconcile the vast scope of the intense rate of murder of Poland’s decentralized Jewish population vis-à-vis the limited manpower available to the Germans from 1942 to 1943. His search for answers led him to the post-war testimonies of some RPB101 members. The book is based almost entirely on these testimonies. In his final analysis, Browning uses a social-psychological approach to synthesize the information gleaned from the testimonies with psychological experiments that were conducted to test theories on authority, conformity and compliance.Browning opens in the Polish town of Jósefów, the site of RPB101’s initiation into mass murder. Here he reveals the “extraordinary offer” that Major Trapp, the unit’s commander, extended to some of his men: those who did not wish to participate could fall out. Browning astutely uses this event — the choice the men faced — to frame his argument throughout the book. Chapters Two and Three provide context with a brief history of the Police Battalions, from their inception as part of the Freikorps to their deployment to the occupied territories in the east. Here, Browning uses these chapters to point out that most of the men had volunteered to avoid conscription into the army and that they had done so before the war. These are facts Browning uses to prove conclusively that the men had not engaged in self-selection for the killing squads. He reinforces this argument in Chapter 5 by pointing out their average age (too old to have been educated by the Nazis during their formative years), working-class backgrounds (more likely to have held socialist or communist views), and the fact that they came from Hamburg (one of the least “nazified” cities in German.)The following two chapters piece together the testimonies to form a narrative of the unit’s first “action”, upon which Browning’s conclusions are largely based. After Major Trapp’s offer, a small number of men chose not to participate in the killings. The Jews of Jósefów were rounded up and the shootings were carried out haphazardly. Some men shot all through the day, others shot a few victims before asking to be excused (10-20% by Browning’s estimate), others shirked and evaded. Browning also highlighted the men who disobeyed orders. In one instance, they were ordered to shoot the infants during the roundup; instead, the men allowed them to be brought to the collection point and received no reprimand for disobeying orders. The sources tell of the dejected state of the men when they returned to the barracks following the massacre. The killings took an emotional toll on many of them.For the remainder of the book, up to the conclusion, Browning documents the various deportations and killings in which RPB101 participated. The difference between later massacres and Jósefów is that the unit mostly provided the cordon while auxiliaries, Trawnikis, carried out the actual killing. Most importantly, he dedicates a chapter to the so-call “Jew Hunts”, which he calls “a tenacious, remorseless, ongoing campaign in which the ‘hunters’ tracked down their ‘prey’ in direct and personal confrontation.” Throughout, Browning stresses the individual actions of unit members: some participate reluctantly, some are eager volunteers, some abstain from shooting when given the chance, others shoot when not ordered. Still others grow increasingly sadistic the more they are exposed to the killing. No one is ever punished for failing to shoot.Why did eighty percent of the men kill if they were neither hand-picked murderers nor forced to shoot? Browning concludes that careerism, peer pressure and conformity in deference to authority are the likely reasons why many chose to kill rather than fall out. Overall, he makes a persuasive case. He disproves self-selection while proving that the unit represented a cross-section of German society at the time. His most persuasive arguments are those relating to peer pressure — not wanting to leave one’s comrades with the “dirty work” — a point that will likely resonate with anyone who has served in a combat unit.The question of ideology is where the greatest weakness lies. Browning shows convincingly that the indoctrination material the men received while serving in the unit was pedestrian, at best. His thesis might have been better served if, earlier in the book, he had placed greater emphasis on the antisemitic climate that served to dehumanize their victims. While he does discuss this point, he does so only briefly in the conclusion. The title Ordinary Men leads to some ambiguity since without this contextual framing from the beginning; it sometimes reads as though he is arguing that any cross-section of men from any time or place could be capable of committing the same crimes. His use of the Milgram experiment seems to support of this appearance, since the experiment was designed to prove that ordinary Americans were capable of the same kind of complicity as Nazi war criminals. It leaves his work somewhat vulnerable on the issue of ideology, and another author, Daniel Goldhagen, will zero in on this, though he will take his own argument to the extreme."

253,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/94131787-liam-b,Rating 4 out of 5,"How do ordinary men become hardened killers? What effects does killing innocents have on ordinary men? These are a couple questions that this book seeks to answer in the context of a German police battalion stationed in occupied Poland during WWII.In this review I will speak mostly on insights I gained from the book, rather than critiques of Browning's research and writing. Browning has an afterword in the book that is useful for anyone looking for dissenting opinions.The men of Reserve Police Battallion 101 (RPB 101) weren't specially chosen to carry out the Final Solution. Most of them were middle aged, working class men from Hamburg. They grew up in pre-Nazi Germany, and thus knew a set of moral values outside the realm of Nazi Germany. Most were not members of the Nazi Party either.Browning posits a multi-faceted approach to explain how these ordinary men started killing innocents. While they didn't necessarily follow the Nazi ideology, it's clear anti-Semitism was widespread in the battalion and Germany as a whole. A combination of the polarizing effects of war (us vs. them, the dehumanization of the enemy) and racism towards the Jews created ripe ground for the Final Solution to be carried out. When push came to shove, 10-20% of the battalion members chose to not kill or shoot any Jews. These men were viewed as ""weak"", unable to carry out the ""dirty work"" assigned to the battalion. Indeed, most non-shooters agreed that they were ""weak"" so as to not appear high and mighty. Why did such a small percentage of men choose to not kill? Many factors played into this. One was group dynamics. The men were stationed abroad, with a population relatively hostile towards them. If they chose to not shoot, they risked ostracism from their comrades. From a survival point of view, not shooting meant a greater chance of being kicked out of the ""tribe"" and killed in hostile territory. While conformity to the group was one facet, another was following authority. Major Trapp, the battalion commander, is described as a ""soft"" authority figure. He himself wept after giving the initial orders to kill the Jews, and didn't force men to carry out the task. The strong authority then came from other officers and Trapp's commanders. After the initial shooting most men suffered great psychological (and physiological) distress. They were given large rations of alcohol after shooting to help ""relieve"" the burden. Indeed, other units (such as the Hiwi auxiliary units) that did most of the shooting often got so drunk during the action as to forget their actions afterwards. One officer from the RPB 101 suffered from stomach aches every time an action was about to take place; his body (and conscience) was rebelling against his mind's will to kill innocents. Indeed, many other shooters had similar experiences, where they had to stop shooting because their bodies became physically sick (likely at a combination of their inhumane actions and the physical scene). An interesting observation is that many shooters grew too ""weak"" to continue shooting after killing a few innocents. One might think that after getting blood on their hands with the first kill, they would continue indefinitely, but this was not the case. For many, they grew physically sick after killing three or four innocents and had to leave; their conscience was in open rebellion against their mind. While the first action against the Jews was very hard psychologically on the battalion, they grew more callous overtime. Indeed, besides a few more instances, the battalion mainly shifted to ghetto clearing and deportation duty. What this meant was they weren't typically the ones doing the mass killings, as they would ship the Jews off to camps. Browning notes that the men were much more willing and less distressed about this process, as the killing was ""out of sight, out of mind"". This dehumanization/bureaucratization of the killing process, Browning notes, played a key role through the Holocaust.As a reader I always like to consider ways in which I can apply insights from books in my own life. I believe a central message in this book is in recognizing that you, as a human, are capable of committing atrocities, whether you realize it or not. In recognizing this, you can grow to question authority and conformity more often; because what we see with Nazi Germany is that neither the authority nor the masses are necessarily morally correct. I'm reminded of a quote by Atticus Finch in To Kill a Mockingbird, ""Before I can live with others I have to live with myself."" This isn't more true than in the context of facing authority and conformity. Before either of those, you must consider if your own self is okay with your actions."
254,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1847371-michael-scott,Rating 5 out of 5,"Ordinary Men Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland is a history book about the WW2 Holocaust inflicted on the Eastern Jewish population. Christopher R. Browning studies an exemplary Police (so, non-SS) unit, whose 500 men are responsible for the killing of tens of thousands of Jewish people in the Lublin District of Poland. Using the methods of socio-psychological history---studying historical events with a focus on the social embedding and psychological characteristics of the main actors related to the events---, applied to primary documentary material---complete records of post-war judicial interrogations---. Browning finds that the Germans under study have ordinary social and psychological backgrounds, and their reaction is far from uniform: although many are enthusiastic killers and most carry through the orders without complaint, a minority of opponents and non-killers does emerge.Overall, an excellent study. Albeit truly difficult to read, because of the almost graphic depiction of the atrocities (and Battalion 101 commits so many!), the analysis is both deep and, most importantly, broad. We are finally able to understand the nuances of the killing machine setup by Nazis but perpetrated by ordinary Germans, this time in Eastern territories (so, not main Germany--there are significant differences). The impact of this book is increased by the recent findings (2010+) related to the astonishing number of people killed by Germans in Eastern territories, see for example Alison Smale's ""Shedding Light on a Vast Toll of Jews Killed Away From the Death Camps"".Factually, the 500 men in this police unit are responsible for over 80,000 Jewish deaths. The battalion mentioned in the title is deployed between mid-1942 and late-1943 in the Lublin District. They participate in numerous grave atrocities and commit the most despicable of genocides, literally exterminating by shooting the entire Jewish population of the Lublin District. They are further involved in terror of horrific level and man-hunting parties, spiraling down to cordoning Jewish population into the camps at Belzec, Majdanek, Sobibor, and Treblinka. Browning gets access to primary material of great quality and detail. Of about 500 men, over 200 are interrogated by the Hamburg Office of the State Prosecutor (Staatsanwaltschaft), in a decade-long inquiry started in the early 1960s. The group also includes 10-15 police officers from Luxembourg. Although sometimes self-exculpatory, and comprehensively shifting blame from German offices to Polish collaborationism, the testimony allows Browning to conduct a deep socio-psychological study of the group. The same dataset was used in Daniel Goldhagen's Hitler's Willing Executioners; the results of the two studies are compared, not without self-interest, int he afterword of Ordinary Men.The first part of the book is dedicated to depicting atrocities and explaining their short-term evolution. There is also piece-wise analysis. Related to the action, what Browning finds:- The total number of victims exceeds 90,000, of which at least 80,000 were Jewish.- The members of Battalion 101 were ""ordinary Germans"". They were not selected especially for their mission, they were not even self-selected, they simply represent a cross-cutting section of the middle and low-end of the German society. Most of them were not even members of the Nazi party.- Battalion 101 went to great lengths to fulfill their mission, the total extermination of the Jews living in the Lublin District. As a group, they were active, inventive, deceitful, and murderous. For the largest operation, Erntefest, they took great care to orchestrate surprise and achieve their murderous goals.- The SS had relatively little participation in the mass killings in the area; it was the ""ordinary Germans"" who committed most of the atrocities.- The Germans were actively aided in killing Jews by Lithuanians, Ukrainians, and other Hiwis.- Identifying Jews in villages with mixed population and exterminating Jews in hiding was greatly facilitated by the collaboration of Polish locals.- Polish people who helped Jews hide, or even not report them, were shot by the Germans.- The Jewish communities who have already been subjects to pogroms and mass massacres tried to escape; here, the dedication of Polish informants led to thousands more Jews being killed. In contrast, Jewish communities who had no direct experience with mass massacres , e.g., the Jews of Vienna, hoped for the best and traveled to death camps without major attempts to escape.- The cases where Jews were opposing arm in hand were very rare. The singular case reported here ends with the death of over 100 Jews; numbers are not reported for Germans. Whenever encountering force, the Germans acted swiftly, killing the opponents and them ordering the slaughter of over 100 locals (mostly Jews) for each of their own losses.- Romania is responsible for the single largest massacre of Jews in one operation: the massacre of over 50,000 Odessan Jews in October 1941. (Erntefest in the Lublin District resulted in over 42,000 deaths.)- About 10-15% of the Battalion 101 members have protested, refused to shoot, and overall declined to participate in the atrocities. None of them suffered harsh consequences, albeit none of them was further promoted. In contrast, about 20-25% of the members of Battalion 101 were dedicated, viciously anti-Semitic murderers. (One of them brought his new wife to the Lublin District, to witness the deportation and killing associated with it.) The remainder were selfish, perhaps not entirely willing but certainly participating, killers.- From the members indicted immediately after the was in Poland, none was trialed for the massacre against Jews and, consequently, none was convicted for it. They were indicted over the death of 50-100 Polish citizens. - Only 14 of the over 210 remaining members were indicted (in 1962). The post-war trials resulted in joke-convictions; the largest was 8 years in prison, turned into 4 at the appeal. Even so, this was one of the few convictions given by the German justice system to genociders, post-war. Browning asks an important question: what drove these ""ordinary Germans"" to commit their dreadful acts? He conducts a study of the different social (cultural) layers present in Battalion 101---a stratified picture of the middle and low-level classes of Germany. He offers and analyzes several causes for the actions of these Germans: conformity with the actions of peers, deference to authority, lack of control due to distance from the political and executive center, response to war and propaganda(explains racism, especially anti-Semitism, as a response rather than a deeply rooted aversion), desire for promotion, perhaps coercion, and attenuation of responsibility (which may actually be a consequence of conformity and of the duhumanization of victims by propaganda). The nuanced analysis is excellent and well-supported with documentary evidence, and thus convincing. However, the main issue with this analysis is that it can only provide a single, over-arching, pessimistic conclusion: because the predominant social and psychological characteristics of ordinary people are so common and led to so dire consequences, it is reasonable to believe that authoritarian regimes had, are having, and will continue to have an easy task in convincing ordinary citizens to commit atrocious acts and even mass murder. Unfortunately, this conclusion is supported by the many genocides that have occurred in the meantime, including Rwanda, Kosovo, Sudan, etc.Last, Browning proposes an in-depth analysis of Daniel Goldhagen's Hitler's Willing Executioners. He concludes that the single-mind approach proposed by Goldhagen, under which all (or a sufficient majority of) Germans were enthusiastic followers of the Nazi doctrine because of their deeply ingrained anti-Semitism, does not stand ground. The main counter-examples, including the different reactions offered by the 500 police-men of Battalion 101, and the similar treatment of Slavs and Jews during the most murderous years 1941-1943 (and, earlier, the treatment of non-Jewish German citizens with mental issues), are convincing. To conclude: I would recommend this book to everyone who want to learn about the way ordinary Germans helped with mass murder in Eastern Europe."
255,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/134553557-mike-futcher,Rating 5 out of 5,"Ordinary Men is, unsurprisingly, a devastating read. Author Christopher R. Browning meticulously chronicles the development of a group of reservist German policemen sent to Poland in World War Two. These were, as the title of the book says, 'ordinary men'; their formative years pre-dated the rise of Nazism; they had families, careers and were often given the sincere option of refusing 'anti-Jewish' orders. These were not the brutal, square-jawed, foaming-at-the-mouth anti-Semites we have been led to believe all Germans were. In fact, as Browning says, ""By most criteria, in fact, the opposite was the case. By age, geographical origin, and social background, the men of Reserve Police Battalion 101 were least likely to be considered apt material out of which to mold future mass killers"" (pg. 164). And yet, for their very first major 'action' in the East, ""at least 80 percent of those called upon to shoot continued to do so until 1,500 Jews from Józefów had been killed"" (pg. 74). By the end of their tour of 'duty' in the East, the ordinary men of the battalion had directly executed at least 38,000 Jews (and that is a conservative estimate, and one not including non-Jewish Polish 'collaborators' and 'partisans', or village reprisals) and were responsible for facilitating a further 45,000 on trains to extermination camps; a final total of at least 83,000 Jews (pg. 142).The underlying question of Browning's work becomes frighteningly clear: ""If the men of Reserve Police Battalion 101 could become killers under such circumstances, what group of men cannot?"" (pg. 189). It is sobering, instructive and deeply chilling to contemplate; it is not for nothing that popular Canadian psychologist Jordan B. Peterson often cites Browning's book when discussing the capacity of regular people for deep malevolence, and how you should take responsibility as an individual and not submit to the one-step-at-a-time path of mindless political or racial groupthink.Browning is more circumspect with his own conclusions; far from providing a definitive answer on how these 'ordinary men' quickly became such casual mass killers of women and children, he considers all possible factors, from the usual suspects (anti-Semitism, groupthink, coercion, etc.) to more nuanced ones, not discounting the possibility of a blend of all such factors. He offers a ""multi-layered portrayal of the battalion"" and a ""multicausal explanation of motivation"" (pg. 216). It is certainly more complex than the 'banality of evil' concept, or mere anti-Semitic sentiment (Browning comprehensively dismantles the arguments of one such proponent of the latter, Daniel Goldhagen, in an extensive Afterword). If the lack of a satisfying psychological conclusion is absent from the work, it is only because Browning is no psychologist but a historian; and in consequence he shows the professional historian's characteristic (and commendable) reticence where facts cannot be completely determined.Consequently, whilst the book raises far more psychological questions than answers, it is excellent as a piece of reconstructive history. It pieces together obscure events from disparate and sometimes contradictory sources with judiciousness, showing the reader that the Holocaust was even more terrifying than they thought. The narrative is frightening in its implications and its stark reality; the personal details from the massacres are devastating. If the book is a difficult read, this is not only because of its dry academic observations and reproduction of statistics, but because of its lucid descriptions of unimaginable (and sometimes all-too-imaginable) genocidal horror. It is a reality we often shy away from, that world of violence and cruelty; still less do we accept that there are few heroes, and even if we sometimes accept that we could be a victim, very rarely do people acknowledge that they could be a willing perpetrator. The knowledge is almost too much to bear honestly, which is why it is commendable that Browning claims only the role of chronicler rather than pontificator. He claims only the hope that the case ""will serve history better than [it has] served justice"" (pg. 146)."
256,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"Wow this book was incredible! The first half or more was going through the history of reserve police battalion 101, which was made up of ordinary men who became mass murderers in Nazi Germany. It started by talking about many of the atrocities that were committed such as the mass slaughter in many villages. These stories start to form in your mind thoughts such as how could anybody do this? In the part of the book these questions are answered and discussed, namely Browning draws out that it is ordinary men like me and you who could easily in the correct situation become mass murderers. It is important to read about these stories, especially for a Christian to really understand how evil humans are and how much sun is infiltrating our lives. The fact that ordinary men can become mass killers completely aligns with the Christian perspective of humanity and goes against the naturalistic/atheist perspective, which often says how good and righteous people are.I will just give a few points that the author made about how ordinary men can commit these atrocities. One thing that stood out to me was how the very first time when they were to go and have an action against the Jews (kill a whole village of Jews; women, men, and children), the commander was crying and said it was a horrible thing they had to do. He told the group that anybody who wants to step out and not take part could do so. Originally only one person stepped out, then a few more. During all the killings Browning makes it clear that the men were not forced to kill, even if some had seniors who were saying they would give punishments, there was never any example of the punishment actually given. People who wanted to get out of it could easily go to the top commander of the unit and be relieved from that duty without any negative consequences. The men were often given explicit chances to step out and yet only 20% of people left the killings and this included those who had maybe killed 10 women already and then realized what they were doing and just could not continue. Browning gives one reason for why nobody would have stepped out in the beginning, namely that it was a new group and nobody wanted to look like a coward. It was the peer pressure, (everybody else is doing this and if I step out I'm going to look like a fool) that led people to take steps towards becoming killers. It didn't help that those who did step out gave their reason for stepping out as being too much of a coward and not brave enough to kill, when in reality they were the ones who were brave and willing to look bad in front of their comrades. Overtime the men became harden to the killings so that those at the first killing who was squeamish and sick and hated what they were doing became cold blooded ruthless killers in the end. Again this aligns very well with the perspective that the Bible gives about not giving the devil a foothold because the first step towards sin can be something that we feel bad about, but we let ourselves continue and then overtime we stop thinking it's wrong.I'll give one more interesting inside from Browning. Some people object that actually it's the anti-Jewish propaganda that was steeped in the culture that caused these people to become murderers. Browning points out that the propaganda had a very small role to play in making these men killers. Firstly the propaganda was actually quite light and not as bad as you expect. Most convincingly there was 14 people from Luxembourg in the battalion who didn't have any of this anti-Jewish propaganda growing up or in their adult life and yet they became part of the police battalion and all of them took part in the killings. The propaganda did play a role, but it wasn't a sufficient condition to cause people to become killers. This book was filled with many such insights and I would highly recommend it as an important lesson in human sinfulness and a reminder that humanity is not as good as many people assume."
257,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38726195-stefanie-robinson,Rating 4 out of 5,"Reserve Police Battalion 101 was founded on May 6, 1940. During World War II, paramilitary organizations were formed under the leadership of the SS. The 101 was mainly comprised of men in their 30's, who were considered too old to join the regular Army. To begin with, 101's assignment was to guard Polish prisoners of war behind German lines. They also participated in the expulsion of Polish residents from occupied areas, and the kidnapping of Polish children for ""Germanization"". Later on, in March and April 1942, 101 transported Jewish people from Lublin to concentration camps. The mass murders that they committed were simply atrocious. They were provided with alcohol and extra ammunition. They rounded up Jewish people, spent seventeen hours shooting them at point blank range while they begged/screamed/cried/tried to escape. They left the bodies laying where they fell, looted. Their uniforms were bloody and full of body tissue. This scene was repeated over and over. Estimates suggest that they were responsible for the murders of 83,000 Jewish people. Just their Battalion...there were others just like it. That is a massive amount of people.I think that it is important to look at these events from all sides. People voluntarily join military organizations all over the world. People are drafted or conscripted into military service in times of war. Some countries even have a mandatory minimum service requirement. People generally find this reasonable and acceptable. The men of 101 fit into these generally reasonable and acceptable categories. What separates them from most other military organizations is the wide scale of their war crimes and the documentation of them. There is a saying about what is done in the dark, rises to the light...but they did their dark in the middle of the day. It was seen. It was photographed. It was documented. I do not think that most of these men were inherently evil people, and I am certain they were plagued by images and flashbacks for the rest of their lives about things they had done and experienced. (As they should have been.) A few times in the book, it was mentioned that they voluntarily let them switch out or sent those who could not continue back to the trucks, so I know it affected at least some of them. I doubt seriously that you could be party to the execution of 83,000 people and it not stay in your mind. I think that it is really interesting to consider how and why these men found themselves in this position to begin with, how they managed to carry out this gruesome and murderous work, and how some of them found themselves enjoying it. I find it interesting to consider the implications of an uprising to protest or refuse to do these crimes. Were they afraid they would be murdered? Likely. Were they born and raised into obedience without question? Likely. Were they anti-Semitic and thought this was really the best way to rid German society from the plague of people that were targeted demographics? Probably. The entire Holocaust is fascinating because of these multifaceted questions and how groups of people let themselves believe nonsense and follow orders and do horrible things to human beings. This is just a drop in the bucket of that, and a great topic for a discussion on human nature.I thought the book itself was quite well written and researched. Reading material like this is not for the faint of heart, because it was really grim. It is an important book and important topic for several reasons. The people who were murdered deserve to have their stories known. Knowing how and why this type of action came to be carried out and accepted is important so that society may not travel down that path again. It is important to the discussion of human nature and the willingness to follow leaders. For those reasons, it was a great book, despite the subject matter being horrific. "

Second paragraph will contain more information on my opinion/may contain spoilers/details.The book is very important as a reference material for those interested in the topic of genocide and human nature when it comes to it. I should start off by saying, history is my jam, and I read everything I can on genocides, especially the 20th century, not because I'm morbid, but because it's a fascinating look at human nature, both the very worst and very best, bravest we can be. So, in my pursuit of that topic, this book was recommended in a JP class discussion on the topic of genocide and the entire book is a look at how can ordinary people can become completely fine with mass murder of other people. I found the book very interesting, and for someone who reads on this topic constantly this was definitely worth a read as it's from a different sort of angle. Most books in this genre concentrate on the final solution as far as death camps and this is really about the extermination of Jews, mostly by gunfire, before they were even sent away on trains. It is moderately graphic as it's subject requires and with the numbers of people killed. It can be a bit dry because you going through the history of these killing events, and it's got a lot of detail in it. The author does address that much of this information came from soldiers once they were being prosecuted, so he already points out where you should take a version of events ""with a grain of salt"", but I believe he makes a good argument for how you can change people into killers. I would highly recommend this book for anyone interested in this subject or if you just want to look at human nature or how can people become desensitized enough to hate another group of people enough to kill even women and children without it bothering them. There seems to be some controversy (I was not aware before reading book, but it was enough for the author to write about it in the book's edition as an add on) between this author and the one who wrote ""Hitler's Willing Executioners"", (which I have but have not gotten to yet, when I do I'll come back and update this review). I believe they differ in their opinions on some of this authors claims on the soldiers motives or nature. I'll leave it here for now, this book's premise, that you can take ordinary men, especially the younger ones, (very critical in this book, I noticed throughout that running theme as I've noticed in EVERY book of genocide, the young are easier to manipulate into hating/murdering their ""enemy"") and turn them into mass murderers. Making the argument that most of these men weren't monsters in their hearts to begin with; but a steadily increasing propaganda of hatred for the ""other"" and incremental steps of ordered violence towards the ""other"" group, allowed over time, for the complete transformation of almost an entire group of men (I believe about 500 in this particular case of battalion 101 ) into callous murdering machines that SHOT in cold blood at LEAST 38,000 men, women and children in 5 months and deported to Treblinka 48,000 to their deaths. I found this to be a very important read for a look into human nature and how the masses can become monsters towards their fellow man and as I always do with this subject, see the beginning steps towards that are take to lead to that result. I am always wanting to see how did they get there....because that's how you stop history from repeating. It's not the final events you have to stop from recurring, it's the small steps in that evil direction you have to avoid from their start. Highly recommend."

260,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8902279-larry,Rating 4 out of 5,"On June 20, 1942, Reserve Police Battalion 101 was sent to Lublin, Poland, as part of the implementation of Hitler’s Final Solution. Some 80% to 90% of the men in the battalion embraced or went along with their assignment to kill Jews, while 10% to 20% refused or evaded killing duties. Why?The likely answers to the question posed are first, social solidarity. Those who defected from the program to kill Jews did so in a way that validated the decision of those who embraced the killing. Second, the sensitivities of the members of the battalion were dulled by repeated involvement in the extermination effort. Third, that subset who—for whatever reason—experienced pleasure in killing were recognized and rewarded.Browning suggests several explanations: wartime brutalization, racism, segmentation and routinization of the task, special selection of the perpetrators, careerism, obedience to orders, deference to authority, ideological indoctrination, and conformity.The psychological effect of a division of labor for the killing process was highly significant. The larger actions involved joint ventures and splitting of duties. The policemen always provided the cordon, and many were directly involved in driving the Jews from their homes to the assembly point and then to the death trains, but at the largest mass shootings, “specialists” were brought in to do the killing. Groupings emerged within Reserve Police Battalion 101: a nucleus of increasingly enthusiastic killers who volunteered for the firing squads and “Jew hunts”; a larger group of policemen who performed as shooters and ghetto clearers when assigned, but who did not seek opportunities to kill, and a small group (less than 20 percent) of refusers and evaders.Any member of the battalion could evade killing. A set of unwritten “ground rules” emerged within the battalion. For small shooting actions, volunteers were requested or shooters chosen from among those who were known to be willing to kill. For large actions, those who would not kill were not compelled. Even officers’ attempts to force individual nonshooters to kill could be refused. Direct proximity to the horror of the killing significantly increased the number of men who would no longer comply. However, with the division of labor and removal of the killing process to the death camps, the men felt scarcely any responsibility for their actions. A vital factor was conformity to the group. The battalion had orders to kill Jews. Some 80 to 90 percent of the men proceeded to kill, though almost all of them where initially horrified and disgusted by what they were doing. But, to break ranks and step out, to adopt overtly nonconformist behavior, was beyond most of the men. It was easier for them to shoot. By breaking ranks, nonshooters were leaving the “dirty work” to their comrades. It was an asocial act. Those who did not shoot risked isolation, rejection, and ostracism—a very uncomfortable prospect within the framework of a tight-knit unit stationed among a hostile population.In addition, stepping out was a form of moral reproach of ones comrades—the nonshooter potentially indicated he was “too good” to do such things. Most nonshooters tried to diffuse the criticism of their comrades by pleading not that they were “too good” but rather that they were “too weak” to kill. This approach to maintaining the bonds of comradeship, by those who did not shoot, reaffirmed the “macho” values of the majority,. "
261,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32281217-evan-micheals,Rating 4 out of 5,"This was a terrible book on the Jordan Peterson recommended reading list that I am slowly working my way through (have not been disappointed yet). It follows the experience of the 101st Police Reserve Battalion, as they journey from Ordinary Men to Genocidal Killers. It is terrible because it shows how easily this happened and was normalised. Men would rather commit mass murder than be seen as weak or leave the unpleasant task to their comrades.I could only read this through a Jungian lens. The soldiers were given training on how to fire a round for a ‘merciful quick death’ at point blank range. They could not do it. Their bodies and psyches rebelled, meaning something that was terrible already became worse. Their inability to fire an accurate round into a defenceless prone person cause further suffering on all levels. Prolonged deaths for those being murdered, and being covered in blood, bones, and brains as skull shattered and exploded for the murderers. The murderers suffered symptoms of PTSD for the rest of their lives, with predicable alcoholism dominating their futures. They admitted their guilt and their trials were often a catharsis with some gladly accepting their punishments as atonement for their guilt. Dostoevsky got this aspect of human psychology correct in Crime and Punishment. This was the epitome of evil with no winners for the perpetrators or victims. It describes terrible things and holds a mirror to the horror of humanity.Not all soldiers could perform an ‘action’ of mass murder as they were so overcome with physical symptoms that paralysed acting. These people were considered weak and not punished for their weakness, just reassigned. One poignant example was a man who could not act and considered a weak coward by peers because he was overcome by nerves when it came to killing Jews in cold blood. The man arranged for a transfer to the Russian Front and won the Iron Cross. His psyche could not commit murder, but he could kill when his opponent had a chance in a kill or be killed environment.Following large ‘actions’ of mass murder the German High Command would throw alcohol fuelled concerts to juxtapose the beauty of German Culture with the ‘unpleasant’ tasks they were asked to perform. I am sure I have read research that one of the best things you can do following a traumatic event is to get well drunk as this inhibits memories moving from the short term to the long term memory, and might inhibit the development of PTSD. Brownings account was that there was plenty of alcohol for the members of the Reserve Police Battalion during the ‘actions’, leading to further inaccuracy for the victims. The German High Command must have had a non-scientific understanding of neuroscience.It is not a book for the faint hearted and will leave you with unforgettable knowledge. It describes terrible things and humanity at its worst. This is us, we are capable of doing this. Peterson’s suggested take away from this is seeing the evil that you are capable of, and seeing the terror and misery you could create, and then not doing it. This is the difference between being weak and being meek. A weak person does not have the capacity to do evil acts, a meek person does have a capacity for evil but choose not to act on this ability. I saw a lot of what Jung identified in action. We are not as in control or as rationale as we would have ourselves believe. We need a bit of humility about ourselves."
262,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/104328693-emily,Rating 4 out of 5,"There was always a way out, and yet many did not take it. That was the message I kept getting: when these soldiers were ask to kill, up close, they were given the affirmative opportunity to decline without formal repercussion, and some did. Throughout, they had the opportunity to stop if their 'nerves' failed them, and some did. Many took the route of passive avoidance, being slow to act, inaccurate, or in the wrong place. There was no time when soldiers were threatened with bodily harm for refusing. No formal punishment at all in fact. There were many examples of particular soldiers refusing to take part and never receiving any consequences - in fact they were simply overlooked and never asked again when future acts were needed. The demographic of this unit was not the target for Nazi propaganda, because they were too old and had experienced a philosophical upbringing outside the one taught by the Nazis. In fact, this cross-section was likely to be over representative of those people not supportive of Nazi ideals, because volunteers had already been called in prior units, meaning this unit was comprised of people 'left behind', not the fanatics. And yet, this unit became one of the top killing units. Why? Why did so many ordinary people participate when not participating had no formal consequence?This commentator indicates that there were likely many factors, and different factors held different sway for different people. Some of these factors: mere peer pressure to avoid looking weak, participation that was removed from up-close-and-personal contact, alcohol, and repeated exposure all resulted in ordinary men acting this way. See Milgram experiment. Those who resisted were those who tended to resist at the first opportunity (reinforcing future decisions), those who had some other trade to which they planned to return after the war (did not need to become successful policemen), and tended to denigrate themselves (by blaming their own weakness) to not participate rather than judging those around them. In a situation like this, most 'ordinary men' were first horrified and traumatized - demonstrating physical revulsion that their mind could not control. But over time, most of these ordinary men became accustomed and even began to enjoy heinous evil. In their first acts, every detail of their victims was seared in memory. But over time, these same men forgot entire days of massacre, or else remembered instead only irrelevant details, such as how cold their feet were. Who would stand against evil if everyone else was doing it? Most people think they are one of the rare ones who would. But this book reveals that such bravery is truly quite rare, and often possessed by people who (just like those turned into mass murderers) were also quite ordinary, hard to guess who will possess it. The average person thinks that they are above average, but the fact is that the average cannot be above average. Overall, it's a terrifying book that challenges the premise that humans are fundamentally good. Well cited throughout. Scholarly, but never boring. This book made me research the reality that there are many concentration/filtration/internment/work camps that are active today and have no present sign of being stopped. The horrors described in Ordinary Men are not evils we have left behind in the 20th century. They linger like embers and catch unnoticed."

I don't understand."" In reference to what is happening in Ukraine. The answer to that question is: very easily. This is a tremendous scholarly work by Browning, but it is worth much more than its historical scholarship. Ordinary Men is much more than just a historical research text. It is a careful examination of the human condition and how any of us, under the right circumstances, can be turned into monsters. The central question of the book is this: How did these men from all different walks of life and different political loyalties turn into a unit of hardened killers that killed thousands of Jews and deported tens of thousands more to certain death in the camps? I think Browning does a wonderful job in answering that question.In this eighteen chapter work the first seventeen chapters are devoted to the historical situation and a careful and explicit retelling of the actions of Reserve Police Battalion 101 during the war. This is necessary because it establishes, by hard evidence, that these men did these things, and that the vast majority did them willingly. Even the most resistant members eventually got their hands bloody. But the true meat of the book is the eighteenth chapter and the subsequent afterword, and ""25 Years Later"" section that is found at the end of the most recent addition.Browning sums up his argument in a way where he combined social pyschology and the historical record to show how people can fall into evil for easily for a myriad of reasons. He does a good job at ripping apart some of the traditional explanations like those that have been posited by Adorno with his ridiculous ""fascistic personality"" explanation. Instead, Browning meets these men on their own terms, not with theory in hand. I appreciated the afterword and the ""25 Years Later"" sections because they are sizeable portions of the text dedicated to responding to his detractors. The photos in the final section of the book are especially harrowing and do a good job of showing that these men lived ordinary lives before, during, and after the war where they were easily able to compartmentalize the evil actions that they were carrying out.I think that this book is a must read. Too often these days we have the tendency of viewing ourselves as ""the good guys,"" or ""being on the right side of history,"" with little to no introspection. We believe that if we were in these other places and time periods that we would be nobler, and that we would act differently. I would hope and pray that this is the case, but history tells a different story. It is only by engaging works like this that challenge our assumptions about our good natures, that we can actually prepare for these hard situations, knowing that when we encounter them we have already thought about our actions. Even if historical books are a turn-off for you I would still recommend reading this. If nothing else read the eighteenth chapter in a copy from your local library, it would be well worth it.For pastors, I think this would be a good text to use when talking about evil. Or at least making reference to it. We have all fallen short of the glory of God, and having a tangible way to remind people of this reality is important."
264,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29678051-karl,Rating 4 out of 5,"Christopher Browning tells the story of the German Reserve Police Battalion 101 which participated in the extermination of Polish Jews in 1942. Browning chose this battalion as his subject for two reasons. First, the actions and organization of this unit are well-documented and the members of the battalion were unusually forthcoming in post-war judicial proceedings investigating the conduct of the unit. Second, the policemen were generally older, less indoctrinated, less likely to be Nazis, and largely chose police duty to stay closer to home and to avoid being drafted into the regular army. In this way, Browning argues that the attitudes of this battalion were more indicative of the attitudes of ordinary Germans than the younger Wehrmacht or ideological SS units who also participated in genocide. Browning's telling is careful, exact, and brutal to read. He does not spare the reader any details. The story he tells is one of reluctant executioners that gradually become inured their gruesome task, though he is careful to highlight individual cases on both sides: men who were initially willing to participate in mass killings but found themselves physically unable to continue and men who were initially incapable of participation but became noted for their sadism as the extermination progressed. Browning documents the various compromises, methods, and technique that commanders and ordinary policemen were forced to make in order to psychologically cope with their tasks. How much contact should each executioner have with their victim, how many people should each policeman be expected to kill, how should the executioners be selected, how insistent should commanders be that all participate? Browning documents several cases where the policemen were psychologically unable to carry out the exterminations as ordered, but adopted other techniques which achieve the same objectives while shielding individual policemen from the most difficult tasks. A set of institutional norms surrounding mass-execution, reprisals, and Jew-hunting developed over time. Particularly, the members of the battalion developed soft limits. There would be tasks that individuals were comfortable handling, and tasks an individual policemen could usually avoid with the tacit acceptance of their commanders and comrades. In the end, however, almost everyone actively participated in some capacity.The final chapters of the book considers the psychology of the policemen and analyzes the spectrum of the different responses. Printings of this book after 1998 include an afterword that is a response to Daniel Goldhagen, the author of ""Hitler's Willing Executioners,"" who criticized this book as attempting to exculpate or minimize the culpability of ordinary Germans in the Holocaust. In the process of defending his methodology and his conclusions, Browning disassembles Goldhagen's thesis that a genocidal antisemitism existed among ordinary Germans which made the Holocaust not only possible but inevitable. Browning points to the German treatment of Soviet POWs, Pols, and Russians, who were executed just as brutally and in larger numbers than Jews prior to 1942. He also discusses the role of non-German eastern European units whose conduct was as sadistic as even the worst SS units. Most convincingly, he argues that Goldhagen adopts a methodology which would be incapable of falsifying Goldhagen's thesis. In this afterword, Browning makes it clear that the actions of the men who carried out the Holocaust cannot be attributed to a uniquely German antisemitism (though he does not deny that it was a contributing factor), but rather that most men are capable of mass-murder and genocide under conditions that are far from unique. A second afterword is included in the 2017 printing; this reinforces the point by analyzing the conduct of other German police units and the growing scholarship on other genocides."
265,no user info,Rating 3 out of 5,"Christopher Brown’s 1992 “Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland” was a hard read, as might be expected from a book about the Holocaust. The book focuses on a group of everyday men in the early 1940s, who comprised a reserve police battalion. Most of the men in these three companies were middle-aged Germans who either did not qualify for military service due to age, or selected police service as a way to avoid becoming soldiers. That said, the men did not receive the same training and indoctrination as regular soldiers, but instead followed the advancing German army into Poland and Russia with the ostensible purpose of being peacekeepers in occupied lands. Instead, they became instrumental in the Final Solution, the elimination of aliens from Europe (i.e., Jews and Gypsies). The story would be very straight-forward if that was it, but it’s not. Along the way, the Germans were helped by Polish and Russian volunteers that approved of their efforts, and sought to aid the Germans in their awful purpose.The book is choked with place names and numbers. For me, it was impossible to wrap my head and sympathies around the numbers. One murder is tragic. Thousands of murders, systematic and mechanically executed, are just impossible to fathom. And so it was with each new Polish town name followed by the tallies of the dead. It might have continued that way if not for the photographs. The photos are not gory. They didn’t need to be. There were pictures of young and old, either gathered in town squares (by the hundreds), or staring into the photographer’s lens, hoping (though they probably knew it was futile) that someone would take mercy on them. No one did. Though some officers claimed to have purposefully missed their targets, many were buried just the same. One of the most memorable parts of the book were how Jews were breaking out of the moving death trains and how the officers had to radio ahead to have nailed boards readied at the next stop to repair the cattle cars as the train rolled in.The end of the book is filled with multiple afterwords, where the author seeks to defend his research and its interpretations against Daniel Goldhagen’s 1996 book “Hitler’s Willing Executioners”. This was the least interesting third of the book, as it dealt with the men’s motivations and sociological pressures. I took a course in a social-psychology in college, and was bored to sleeping. The last half of this book wasn’t much better, for me. While motivations are important, it’s an exercise in layered conjectures to assume one can know why the men did what they did under the pressures and understanding that existed at the time. It was interesting to read however how the Luxembourgers conspired to claim they knew nothing of the killings that their battalion was engaged in. While I found the book informative and revelatory in many respects, I didn’t enjoy (a different word is probably more appropriate here) it overly much. I would, however, recommend it to anyone who wants to know more on the subject as it seems to be well researched and presented. “The Holocaust after all, is a story with far too few heroes, and all too many perpetrators and victims.”"

I think we'd all like to think we would have been one of the ones hiding Jews under our floorboards, but the unfortunate fact is that most of us would likely have gone right along, submitting to Nazi control either by preference or tacit endorsement.Ordinary Men attempts to answer the question of HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN? How did the Nazi government persuade ordinary men to massacre a completely innocent population. Killing is a part of every war, of course, but who would have thought a sane human could ever be convinced to shoot a baby? A summary of explanations:1. Propaganda campaign presenting Jews as instigators (""your wife and child are being bombed at home because of THESE PEOPLE"")2. Group conformity (""everyone else is doing it..."")3. Submission to authority (""they told me to!"")4. Reluctance to appear cowardly5. Rationalization (""they're going to die anyway"")6. Pleasure in killingAll of those excuses (and the others - this is not a comprehensive list) were strengthened by the fact that the men were given no time to reflect upon their actions. Most massacres were completed quickly, with little advanced notice, and accompanied by heavy drinking. In looking at the actions of the individuals within the battalion, Browning comes to the conclusion that MOST men were not killing for pleasure, but for a combination of the other reasons listed. The main explanation, it would seem, is that most men just DID NOT THINK about what they were doing - which is probably the same explanation for the German citizens failing to step forward and protect the Jews as well. The material was quite dense. The chapters blurred together and it wasn't really until the very end that Browning started to hypothesize about why the Battalion was willing to engage in such ruthless killing. I wished there was further explanation as to why SOME men did in fact refuse to kill. What was the difference in their backgrounds or education level or personalities that led them to take a stand? And did any of them, in fact, TAKE A STAND (advocate AGAINST the killing), or was refusing to kill the best we know of?The afterword was quite possibly the most interesting part of the book. A nearby district here is getting some flak because an administrator was recorded saying something about needing a few books in the classroom that give the ""opposing"" view of the holocaust, and people are naturally confused because we didn't know there WERE opposing views to the holocaust. But perhaps the opposing views the administrator was referring to were arguments such as the one between Browning and Goldhagen. Browning was apparently so appalled by Goldhagen's work regarding Police Battalion 101 that he dedicated 10% of his book to tearing apart Goldhagen's theories. Being unfamiliar with Goldhagen myself, the whole chapter seemed like a personal tiff made public. Kind of funny, actually! In any case, clearly there can be and ARE differing views on certain aspects of the Final Solution, and perhaps there is no need to crucify aforementioned administrator. Or maybe I don't understand...."
267,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23986620-david-margetts,Rating 3 out of 5,"This is a book of two halves. The first half provides detailed facts, data, and evidence of the atrocities committed by the Nazis, and in this case Reserve Police Battalion 101. It is not an easy read, given the vast amounts of data and the horrendous acts conducted. The 2nd half of the book is far more interesting, as it looks for the reasons that 'ordinary', middle aged, law abiding men from Hamburg could commit such crimes. In essence it asserts that there is no single reason for the behaviour of the men, more a myriad of situational factors that come to play. Notably the causes lie in the 'brainwashing', ideological indoctrination and propaganda spewed out over many years by the Nazis. This is exacerbated by 'theatre of war' the men finds themselves in, and the human tendency to be obedient to authority and military orders, and to conform, particularly as a group, for reasons of loyalty, fear of rejection, loss of 'face', fear of isolation, loyalty, comradeship and the need to be seen as macho vs 'weak'. These feelings and responses reduce when out of sight and out of mind. These appear to be the factors affecting at least 60% of the men, whilst 20% seem naturally aggressive and sadistic and 20% took the courage to refuse. The 'elephant in the room' is the reflection this book has on human nature. Whilst these atrocities were committed at an incredible scale, a product of Nazism and anti-semitism, it also has to be acknowledged that Eastern Europeans also took part actively in the killings themselves, as well as offering up Jews in the 'hunt'. That said, history shows us that committing such large scale atrocities cannot be seen just as a Nazi, anti-semitic or German problem. Whether in the name of religion; Catholics vs Protestants, Hindus vs Muslims, Shia vs Sunni or Kurd, or ideology; Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, Rwanda, or class warfare; The Terror, revolution, 'disappearances in LATAM, or simply imperialism, colonialism or of course the slave trade. Human beings throughout history have shown themselves capable either directly or to be complicit in torture, killings, and genocide. It seems that in certain situations of unbridled 'power', a feeling of supremacy and superiority, prejudice, and ignorance, we as humans often feel we can act with impunity. Recent Russian atrocities in Ukraine further evidence that in the 21st Century we have made little progress in suppressing our most basest of behaviours. History can and will repeat itself without consequences for such actions. More pertinently though is the question the book really asks us all; How would we act if we had lived through the same time, situation, and environment of Battalion 101? We all know how we would want to act, indeed all of us would say we would have been like the soldier who stepped forward and refused to shoot, men, women and children on the first action.....but in reality would we have had the courage to do so, or would we simply bow to authority and conform with the majority of our comrades, as did the vast majority...I honestly cannot answer that, any more than the Nazis at the time, or the Allied bombers who bombed civilians in Germany night after night. Proximity makes a difference psychologically, but not materially for the women and their children! "
268,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"Order police were paramilitary police units that pre-dated World War II but were used during World War II for maintaining order in occupied territory. Such activities would have included hunting down and executing members of resistance movements. There is more, though. For example, order police units were incorporated in the Einsatzgruppen that hunted down, rounded up and murdered Jews in masse during the invasion of the Soviet Union (Operation Barbarossa) and before the implementation of death camps. Order police battalion 101, featured in this book, was responsible for part of Poland. Their involvement in the Final Solution included the following:•	Roundups of Jews in which Jews were taken to mass grave sites and massacred.•	Roundups of Jews in which the Jews were loaded onto trains for transport to death camps such as Treblinka. In these roundups, infants, small children, the elderly and invalid were shot on the spot.•	Jew hunts to locate Jews living outside of ghettos, such as hiding places in the woods. In such cases, the Jews were shot on the spot.All in all, police battalion 101 was directly responsible for 38,000 deaths and 45,000 deportations to death camps.Why the focus on police battalion 101? During the late 1950s and early 1960s, there was an effort by the German government to investigate such atrocities and to prosecute perpetrators, if possible. There was a wealth of investigative material such as depositions. Furthermore, the battalion included both volunteers and conscripts over a wide age range. Most were not bloodthirsty and rabid Nazis. For many, their formative years had predated the Nazi propaganda machine. They were ordinary men who committed mass murder, and it is very reasonable to ask why. How the men dealt with their mission was as diverse as the men themselves:•	A few, very few, including a Lieutenant, openly condemned the mission and refused to participate in the mass murder.•	A larger number surreptitiously avoided killing by avoiding being at the massacre site or not shooting a Jewish prisoner unless under supervision.•	Some had no problem with killing Jews and even eagerly sought out opportunities to do so.•	Some early avoiders became comfortable with the role of killing as their consciences grew numb.•	Most drew a moral distinction between rounding up and guarding Jews, on one hand, and actively shooting them, on the other hand. In other words, if someone else, whether other order police, non-German auxiliaries (hilfswillige) or death camp staff, did the killing, they bore moral culpability. But if they only helped to get the Jews to the killers and did not actually kill anyone, they saw themselves as morally blameless.The amount of death in the book was absolutely numbing, making it somewhat difficult to read. On the other hand, I found his evaluations of the psychology of the men of the battalion to be very intriguing. As a Christian, I am convinced of the doctrine of sin. What was done then and there by sinful humans could just as easily be done here and now by sinful humans, given the right circumstances. There but for the grace of God go we."

Dazwischen und zum Schluss des Teils Deutungen des Geschehenen und Einbindung in die psychologischen Expirimente von Milgram und Stanford. Es wird versucht Erklärungen zu finden, wie Menschen in der Lage sind die schrecklichen Taten zu begehen, die in ihrer Gesamtheit zum Holocaust an den Juden sich summieren. Das Bild ist differenziert und versucht verschiedene Gruppen innerhalb des Battallions aufzuzeigen von begeisterte Mörder bis ablehnend dem gegenüber, aber ohne dagegen vorzugehen. In dieser historischen Aufarbeitung gibt es leider keine Helden, denn das Battalion alleine war an der Erschießung von 38k Juden und dee Deportation von weiteren 45k beteiligt es ist eine durchweg traurige und verzweiflungserweckende Historie.Der zweite Teil geht auf die Kritik von Daniel Jonah Goldhagen ein und stammt aus dem Jahre 1998.Dort versucht Browning dazulegen, dass die monokausale Sicht Goldhagen  (In Deutschland herrschte vor den Nazis schon ein tief verwurzelter Antisemitismus. Dieser musste von Hitler lediglich freigesetzt werden und die Männer handelten von diesem antisemitischem kulturellem Hintergrund bereitwillig mit und die Aussagen, die sagten sie hätten Zweifel gehabt, seien apologetische Aussagen, um vor Gericht milder bestraft zu werden. [Gekürzte Version des Argumentes im Buch besser dargestellt] )Nicht die volle Bandbreite abdeckt und ein alleiniger Erklärungsansatz für die Taten nicht ausreicht. Ihm gelingt es dort aus meiner Sicht sehr gut Lücken in der Logik Goldhagens aufzuzeigen und auch fachliche Mängel auzuzeigen, bei der Auswahl der Daten von Goldhagen. Der dritte Teil ist dann aus dem Jahre 2017 geht auf die weiteren Erkenntnisse der Geschichtsforschung zu dem Themengebiet ein und gibt noch weiterführende Erläuterungen zu den Bildern in dem Buch. Alles in allem ein sehr gut geschriebenes Buch, mit Quellen gespickt und gut nachvollziehbar zu lesen. Auch wenn ich nicht bei jeder Schlussfolgerung mit dem Autor d'accord gehe, so ist der Tenor(die Erklärung der Taten in Polen wurden von normalen Männern begangen, die unterschiedliche biologische voraussetzung, moral&ziele mitbrachten und je nachdem unterschiedlich stark an dem Holocaust sich beteiligt. Es bedarf daher eine multivariable Erklärung weshalb einfache Männer zu Mördern wurden und über die Gewichtung der faktoren lässt sich dementsprechend streiten. ) doch durchaus plausibel und findet auch meine Zustimmung. Alles in allem ein gutes Buch um die Psychologie der Täter in diesem grausamen Teil der Weltgeschichte besser zu verstehen und vielleicht auch als Warnung zu verstehen, damit man auch als Gesellschaft nicht wieder Situationen schafft, die dies befördern."
270,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13206524-john,Rating 4 out of 5,"This was a grim read and a really heavy subject. I'm not a fan of real stories of brutality, death, and issues like the holocaust, serial killing, etc. However, it is an IMPORTANT read. My edition of the book has two updates, as it was originally written in 1992. It was updated for an edition around 1999, which contains an ""Afterword"" with a critique and defense of the author, Christopher Browning's research and conclusions. The edition I read was copywritten in 2017 with a ""Twenty-Five Years Later"" section in addition to the prior edition(s).I am truly glad I've read this, as it has always bothered me how it seemed (portrayed in movies and TV) that the average German had acted so brutally against the Jews. Browning gets to his conclusions after documenting the formation and then gives details of the activities of Reserve Police Battalion 101.The initial part of the book was the difficult part for me, as it discusses the formation of the Reserve Police Battalions, their initial ""function"", and then their divergence into the sweeping extermination of the Polish Jewry. Truthfully, I did skim-read several sections, but still get the gist of what took place, where, and when. It was pretty heavy stuff, like I mentioned earlier.The second section, is the ""Aftermath"" after the retreat back to Germany. Here is when Browning develops, analyzes, and draws conclusions of how ""Ordinary Men"" did such atrocious things as the majority of the rank and file Battalion members in fact did. The author's primary contention was not fear of reprisal for stepping out of ranks, as many other authors have contended. In fact, he goes pretty far to dispense with that notion. His primary belief appears to be from the psychological aspect of group conformity. His two primary retrospective theories are reinforced by two studies (both of which I have read of many times prior): Zimbardo's Stanford Prison Experiment (regular students were given roles of guards or prisoners), and Milgram's Authority/Hierarchy Complicity experiment (getting subjects to administer electric ""shocks""). These are covered in pages 163 - 174. It does seem so very plausible these psychological factors played a major part.Frankly, you can see much of these two studies in our currently polarized US society. I'm certainly not saying we are heading down this road, as some over-the-top pundits try to spew, but once people make a ""decision"" about their position, they will be complicit to their perceived roles/""side"" and follow whatever loud, bombastic shepherd that gets the most press. So, I do feel it is a very plausible theory to apply to members of the RPB 101.Give it a go, if you have the stomach for some gruesome and disturbing accounts."

Christopher Browning dissects how these middle-age men too old for immediate frontline army duty were conscripted into a Reserve Police Battalion and found themselves rounding up and murdering in cold-blood thousands of Jewish men, women and children in Poland. The author details the actions of leaders & men within a single Battalion (of which there were some 30 similar Police Battalions), how they evolved into their role, and became one of the top ten performing battalions in mass deportation and mass killings, hardly an accolade, yet how did it happen? Christopher Browning explains both psychological & circumstantial factors that led to members of this battalion acting out their orders in a variety of different ways. This book is certainly not an apology for their atrocities, rather a deep dive into how did and could this have occurred with ordinary men.This edition is the 25th anniversary version where the author addresses recent research, publications and criticism into Police Battalions their actions, motivations, and compares to his seminal work. Without revealing the central findings of the book and later works and criticisms the core findings of Christopher Browning remain on firm foundations.History can be viewed and read in a manner of themes or prisms. After completing this book, I found myself reflecting through a “What would I have done, if I were there?” looking glass. These men were recruited as policeman not as mass-killers and from the least likely sector of society, without ideological indoctrination, or knowing what their eventual mission would involve themselves in the center of Hitler’s Final Solution. Judging the circumstances in hindsight is fraught with contemporary bias, yet the moral & ethical question is compelling, “Would I have had the fortitude to resist in 1941?”. I may never know. The benefit from reading this book taught me that given similar circumstances “today”, I would act immediately with conviction and remove myself from the unit and its activities. Brave words, perhaps, yet that is the purpose of reading history, this knowledge allows one to compare circumstances from the past and make the right choices, today. Highly recommend reading the 25th Anniversary versions to enjoy analysis of later works and criticisms. I would also, recommend this book to anyone entertaining ideas that socialism has positive outcomes, the members of Reserve Police Battalion 101 found out the hard way."
272,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"A powerful, quite shocking account of the ordinary men who were commissioned by the Nazi regime to carry out genocide in what Timothy Snyder calls the Bloodlands of eastern Europe. In mid-March of 1942, some 75 to 80% of all victims of the Holocaust were still alive, while 20 to 25% had perished. In mid-February 1943, the percentages were exactly the reverse. At the core of the Holocaust was a short, intense wave of mass murder. The centre of gravity of this mass murder was Poland.This mass murder was carried out at a time when Germany's armed forces were heavily committed on the eastern Front. In trying to find out how the Germans managed to carry out the Holocaust Christopher Browning uncovered the history of Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the indictment that enabled him to give a face to some at least of the perpetrators. This battalion originated from the Order Police created after WWI and incorporated by the Nazis into the regular army. These men were ordered to round up and to shoot Jews, and to assist in the deportation of Jews from Eastern and western Europe to concentration camps, this displacement to secure 'living space' for 'racially pure' Germans.Browning describes these ordinary men of Battalion 101, mostly middle-aged working class men from Hamburg, men who had known political standards and moral norms other than those of the Nazis.This is far from an easy read. It's easy to think of the perpetrators of genocide as monsters, inhuman others, far harder to accept perfectly ordinary men who were husbands, fathers, good policemen, could callously round-up and shoot helpless people, including children, upon orders, even though they faced no disciplinary action if they came forward, though few did, to state they couldn't do what was being asked. It is an informative book, also a profoundly depressing, frightening one. Not wanting to stand out from comradeship, wanting to belong and to be accepted, fear of being seen as a coward, loyalty to the regime and the military, herd instinct...all of these apply to the men of Battalion 101 and led to atrocity, willing executioners. They were not unique, similar situations in other wars and conflict zones continue to the present day. The men of Battalion 101 who survived the war returned home and led ordinary lives. Men like them live among us wherever we are. Any of us can be a perpetrator, and that is what we must take away from reading this book. Browning describes in detail what they did, how those who gave testimony felt about their actions and how it affected them, taken from transcripts during the investigation of Battalion 101 in Hamburg in the 1960s. Without the participation of ordinary men and women the Nazis could not have carried out the Holocaust. Browning wrote his book in the 1990s. In 2018 it is more relevant than ever, sad to say."

One kill at a time...This is the story of reserve police battalion 101 from Hamburg that stationed into Poland while killing and deporting around 80.000 jews.What is so compelling about the book? It shows that these people weren't your regular SS officers with their fancy uniforms, perfectly cut hair and fierce dogs. They were, as the title says, regular men. Before the war they were bakers, gardners, barbers, the Average Joe. Under no circumstance someone would believe that they would be capable of such atrocities (killing naked women and children at point blank, brutally beating old men and forcing jews to dig their own graves).But somehow, all this happened. The author's explanation revolves around camaradery. It wasn't possible that they were brainwashed, since they were born long before 1933, they weren't forced to do it, they were even given a chance to get out of it and certainly there were no punishments for not complying. So the camaradery and the need to mold in the group turned them from defense policemen to serial killers. Basically, they didn't want to be seen by their peers as weak or incapable of executing orders, which would have weakened the entire battalion's consistency (you can't really perform well if you can't trust your colleague in battle). It also became easier for them to kill when they didn't have time to meet their jews. When there was the minimal emotional connection between them, the Germans quickly found ways to excuse themselves from the murders. But as soon as this became routine, the executions went smoothly.The author also makes some parallels to the Stanford experiment, where students were split into guards and prisoners, and it turned out that the feeling of power corrupted people. But also, the Milgram's experiment with electrical shocks administered by naive subjects to people under different circumstances comes into play to demonstrate the way people behave when they see their opponent, when they only hear him, when there's an authority present etc.All in all, this book shows how many people have a ""sleeper"" inside of them which is actually the evil whithin, which can only be accessed in moments of great trial, like these ones. It shows that even a regular human that we consider nice and with which we have regular conversations and pleasanteries can, in moments of great strain, turn into a cold blooder murderer.And the biggest questions that arises from this is: If the history would repeat itself, would I be the opressed, or likely the opressor?"

How does a group of German citizens reluctant to be part of the “Jewish Final Solution”, who are not part of the SS, then end up participating in the killing of 38,000 Jews in Poland and part of the subsequent killing of over 45,000 Jews by deportation to death camps? This book explores court documents and draws broad conclusions on how ordinary citizens can become mass murderers.What I liked: 1). This book was heavy on facts. Numbers, names, dates and places were thrown out in a linear fashion, leading the reader on the clear path traveled by Battalion 101. 2). Although not pleasant to read, the audio book was very well done. 3). Seeing this book as part of a tapestry of Holocaust literature helps clarify the picture of German actions (and those of its neighbors) during WWII. On a larger scale, it adds to paradigm of “them vs us,” re the literature of mass murder and slave labor of a nation’s citizens perpetrated on itself (whether it be the Jewish Holocaust, Russian Gulags or the Chinese Labor Camps and treatment of the Kazakhs and Falun Gong). 4) Understanding, not forgiving, the actions of RPB 101 are important to explore; to try to understand how RPB 101 went from stating early on that they didn’t want to kill any Jews to the point where in their first mass murder assignment, when given a last minute “out”, only about 12% withdrew. What brought so many to take part in their 1st mass shooting of men, women, and children in Poland? Not a single definitive answer is given as THE reason they took part, but quotes and inferences are made from the testimonies given. There are multilayered reasonings: some personal, some social, some systemic. 5). I appreciated his rebuttal essays at the end of the book as it drew differences & similarities between his work and the work of other historians/sociologists. 6) The description of photographs was helpful. 7). I appreciated the author telling his limitations with regards to using testimonies in court cases and journals as sources. 8). The voice actor, Kevin Gallagher, did an excellent job. What didn’t work for me: 1) As stated earlier, the reading was laborious as it centered on Polish towns, German names and 16 months worth of data. The audiobook definitely helped overcome some of this. A difficult read, but important and caused many moments of reflection on how easily we can fall into the trap of tribalism if we are not careful and working to cultivate bravery, compassion and curiosity for the views of those society screams we must exclude, separate, and cancel."

Especially in the West, its captured our attention as the crime amongst crimes, being deeply engrained in our historical consciousness. We can answer a first 'why' then: to never forget the depths of human suffering that, as Browning illustrates, ordinary humans are capable of dealing. Yet Browning's book is not a definitive answer to why we are capable of such only violence. Likely, this question will never be answered, in that we could find a single cause to evil, for lack of a better term. After all, the problem and idea concerns not only the historian, but the anthropologist, the psychologist, the biologist, and the theologist. It's a question we find ourselves dealing with everyday: one magnified expotentially when examining the Holocaust. Again, we have no definitive answers, just as we find ourselves unable to say 'never again.' Never again was the maxim and the meaning we created after the Great War, which quickly fell apart with the onset of the Second World War. And today, while there have been no more Holocausts, violence, war, genocide, are still parts of our lived reality. Remembering and studying the Holocaust has made us more conscious of this fact; nevertheless, to say 'never again' seems a utopian wish in the present. Thus, there are many valuable things Browning's book teaches us - the value of non-conformity, independent and critical thought - along with many disheartening realizations. Namely, for all the men who refused to engage in mass murder, none seperated themselves completely from the violence. Why was there no critical voice of protest when it came to mass murder? None, after all, proclaimed the whole affair as insane and inhuman, they instead stepped aside and let their comrades murder men, women, and children. This resistance I believe, is not an inate character trait. It is trained through critical reflection on the world around us; to step outside the momentum of our actions and reflect on them as such. This, I believe, is the greatest value of studying the Holocaust, along with other episodes of historical violence: reflection, compassion, understanding - antidotes, as I see it, to violence. For we want to live in a world without gratuitous and senseless violence, do we not? "
276,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/90913931-katie,Rating 4 out of 5,"A mind-blowing and terrifying book. It provides a examination of the darker aspects of the human condition.Browning explains - through the use of extensive historical research- how ordinary people can become mass murderers. We all know the Holocaust was utterly horrific, but this book goes into shocking details - perhaps they are most shocking because he talks specifically about the individuals who were behind the killings. So rather than being 'faceless evil Nazi people', they are given colour and made into real people, which I found to be extremely unsettling. Three points struck me in particular: 1. As much as we don't want to admit it, we all have evil within us, and there is a lot of psychological evidence (in case the historical evidence doesn't convince you) that many of us would do exactly the same as these people did if we were in their position. We like to think of ourselves as good people who would have done the right thing at the time, but reading this, you see just how easy it would have been to follow the culture and do what everyone else was doing. We shouldn't kid ourselves into thinking we are the good guys- all humans are capable of extreme evil, and each of us needs to get it under control in our own minds if we are to have even the slightest chance of stopping ourselves from doing awful things. 2. Many of the men initially refused to carry out the killings- but after a while, the process became so routinised and normal that it just became a part of their day. Some men went from hating the 'work' to quite enjoying it. Utterly chilling, when one takes point (1) above into account. What's to say the same wouldn't happen to you? 3. German bureaucrats were far detached from the killings on the ground, so they simply moved numbers around on charts to determine the fates of millions of people. Many of these bureaucrats therefore felt that they weren't responsible for the deaths. This is why both personal responsibility and objective truth are important. Given our proclivity towards evil, we must a) try to ensure we do as much good as possible within our own sphere of influence (or at least, not do things that make things worse) and b) look to an external objective morality to show us whether our actions are good or bad. Intense but fascinating- both as an historical account and as an insight into the inherent tensions in the human psyche. "
277,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/776528-dave-johnson,Rating 5 out of 5,"Incredible book that is simultaneously fascinating and horrifying. In a lot of ways this reminds me of The Rape Of Nanking, but about Nazis. The stories in here are just as horrific. The biggest difference, though, is that the author uses so many first-hand, on-the-record stories that recount the atrocities of the Nazis.The book asks a primary question: how could seemingly ordinary men, without being raised in Nazi propaganda, commit crimes against humanity? It doesn't really try to answer the question directly, but offers a number of differing conclusions. I think the most terrifying conclusion that one would make from this is one that I thought of the most: each person has the ability to do truly evil things, given the circumstances and incentives to do so. This conclusion really stuck with me while reading, and put me in a completely different paradigm for ""understanding"" the Nazis. It's one thing to think of Nazis as a caricature of evil (as many do), Nazis being the personification of evil, and thus are virtually alien from the morals of the person making the characterization. It's entirely another thing to see these people as ordinary men just like you and me, and imagining what you would be capable of doing if you walked in their shoes. I would like to think that I had the moral fortitude (like any other person) to say that I would resist at all costs, but if that were so, why did these ordinary men do these things? It's a terribly direct and somber question that not many people have thought about in that way. In the book, the author notes that there were some ""good"" guys. But even then, the ""good"" that they did was either to not kill because they had the financial status to resist Nazi compulsion, or to resist only AFTER they've already killed a few Jews. This last type of person I thought about the most. Given the number of soldiers and police force, if each person only committed a few atrocities, that would still be a mass atrocity. So even faced with the chance of redeeming yourself with a change of heart, you are still responsible. That's terrifying in a way that is difficult to think about. Despite the hard thoughts and introspective nature of the book, it's still phenomenal. It's well-written, flows well, and is interesting the entire time. HIGHLY recommended. "
278,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4540420-carolyn,Rating 3 out of 5,"This is a great analysis of the Police Battalions who carried out thousands of murders under the Nazi regime without really supporting Hitler's ideology or even feeling overwhelmingly anti Semitic. The monograph focuses on the actions of Battalion 101 and the reasons why the men did what they did. Significant events discussed were the massacres of Józefów, the ""Harvest Festival,"" and the Jew Hunts.Here's a review I wrote for a history classChristopher Browning’s Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland is a strong analysis of the Police Battalion 101’s members participation during the Jewish Holocaust through court interrogation files of the perpetrators. The latter half of the monograph focuses on the reasons why the men killed thousands of Jewish people without fervently supporting Nazism’s beliefs or being a member of the party. Significant events discussed in the text were the massacres of Józefów and Łomazy, the ""Harvest Festival,"" and the Jew Hunts. However, the text also has weaknesses pertaining to the author’s decision to approach the discussion of the murders of twelve million people from a purely academic, emotionless stance.Ordinary Men profiles the chronology of killings done by the men in Russia and Poland as examined in court interrogations done in the 1960s. The author compares the massacre in Józefów to the Łomazy killings. He states that “psychologically, the burden on the killers [at Łomazy] was much reduced” compared to the manner of which they exterminated Jews in Józefów. He also states how it was easier at Łomazy for the men to tolerate their duties because the drunk “Hiwis” were involved. This massacre, after the personal conversations conducted between shooter and victim at Józefów was more organized and systematic. Browning’s later analysis of the psychological reasons as to why the men found it easier to kill when in Łomazy helps the reader understand how ordinary men could commit these crimes. This show of progression from event to event makes the monograph all the more stronger. Browning's in depth look at the evolution of the battalion and their increasing willingness to kill first a few men, then more men, and then women and children is a highlight of the text. This makes it unlike other texts in the field of Holocaust literature. At Łomazy, the Hiwi passed out from drinking alcohol, leaving the duty of extermination for the Police Battalion. Interrogation subjects expressed happiness in not having to do the killings but the men who were called to replace the Hiwis “did not experience anything like the horror...of Józefów.”His emphasis on their average nature is unique. These were men who possessed the standard values and beliefs of the time, not demons waiting in the darkness for a leader. Many inquiries into Holocaust studies can leave the reader feeling as though the Nazi regime and its many extensions (including the Einsatzgruppen and the Police Battalions) were cruel killing machines waiting in silence until that were awakened by the charismatic Hitler and his platform of anti-Semitism. Browning feels that this is not the case. The title of his piece and his most defining chapter, Ordinary Men, shows his opinion that these men were not bred to murder and had no frenzied intentions to kill. They were slowly desensitized to killing Jews through the progression of sophistication in killing methods and desire for conformity among comrades. Between the ages of thirty three and forty eight, and mostly belonging to the working class and lower-middle-class, the men are a representation for a huge portion of Germany’s working force. They were not extraordinary. Other scholars have differing opinions on the men.Daniel Goldhagen's presentation ""Hitler’s Willing Executioners"" at a debate at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington D.C. shows a difference of opinions between Goldhagen and Browning towards the grisly topic. Goldhagen firmly believes that anti-Semitism is at the core of the killings’ cause and that the men truly desired the kill the Jews. However, Browning states in “Ordinary Men” from Ordinary Men that he believes anti-Semitism played some part but that it was not a crucial, keystone point of their rationale. His evidence to believe that the Police Battalion were not raging anti-Semitics who were happy to kill Jews is twofold; firstly, only twenty-five percent of Battalion 101 were members of the Nazi party or supported Nazi beliefs. Secondly, none of the testimonies of the on-trial men stated that they killed the Jews because they were Jews. Rather, they were “just following orders” from an authority figure or were too nervous of being ridiculed for “weakness.”One thing lacking in Ordinary Men is an emotional connection between the writer and the subject. The choice made by Browning to write purely in a calm, detached manner is professional but one sided. The piece could have benefited from use of survivor and witness testimony or the author’s expression of disgust or grief. For instance, Rudi Vrba's I Cannot Forgive also examines the many people who carried out the genocide as well as the victims. Through his experiences, he connects emotionally to the topic and to the reader, letting the reader gain a greater, deeper understanding of the subjects discussed in his memoir. While Browning was not present at Józefów or the Harvest Festival as Vrba was at Majdanek and Auschwitz, Browning could still have managed some sympathetic words for the victims or expressed his distress in his findings.Certainly, one of Christopher Browning's strongest features in his monograph is his ultimate weighing of causes for the actions taken by the Battalion 101 men. He states all possible culprits and the quickly dispatches the unsubstantiated variables. His final arrival at the probable motives for the murders at Józefów and Łomazy, the Harvest Festival, and the Jew Hunts gives the book closure of which is not available in other examinations of the Holocaust. This powerful last chapter, “Ordinary Men,” gives the reader insight into the time period and what it meant to be German, Polish, or Jewish. Furthermore, it shows that the intentions of the Police Battalion members were not initially to massacre thousands but that it was through evolving stages of their faction that they came to be executioners for the Nazi regime. Browning finds desire for conformity, segmentation of duties, and obedience to authority to be the leading reasons for the Battalion 101 members to exterminate Jews. Christopher Browning’s Ordinary Men examines the Police Battalions of Nazi Europe like no other Holocaust literature does. Using comparisons of massacres, the evolution of the men’s willingness to participate, an analytical tone without emotion, and weighing possible reasons for the ordinary man's actions give it strength and distinction in a wide array of works on the subject. The men were not bloodthirsty, they were ordinary men who were drawn into killing thousands of Jews through fear of ostracization. This shows his subliminal warning to readers that something like this is not unique; it could happen again."
279,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is an impressive and important historical analysis. It is more academic than popular history (use of footnotes, detailed analyses, each chapter reads more like an essay than a continuous narrative, and so on). Regardless, the writing style is clear and the content is heavily contextualized - and so it is possible for any reader to understand.The book attempts to answer the question: why would ordinary men, plucked mostly from German society and without any history of violence, commit such horrendous crimes as the massacres of Jews around Poland between 1942-43?I think the author comes to some astounding conclusions. Through his analysis of these later court documents, it becomes clear that a mixture of deference to authority, conformity to group norms, gradual brutalization, and a perceived lack of choice each had a role to play. Interestingly, the author challenges the idea that antisemitism itself can completely explain the actions of the Police Battalion. This was later challenged by Daniel Jonah Goldhagen, which itself led to a robust academic discussion on the motives and functionings of the Holocaust. All of this to say that this book attempts to grapple with important questions and definitely succeeds in beginning the conversation with substantive contributions. The book contains a short history of the order police, the role of the order police in the Final Solution, the specific formation of Police Battalion 101, their actions between 1942-43, and an analysis of the interplay between the identities of Germans, Poles, and Jews.My specific edition contained the original afterword and 1998 afterward that was written in response to Daniel Jonah Goldhagen's book ""Hitler's Willing Executioners"". It also contained the 25th-anniversary afterword that takes stock of the various historical analyses completed since the book's publication in 1992. I have seen some reviews complaining about these afterwords, as they are more focused on historiography and less on the actual history of Police Battalion 101. If you are not interested in this discussion you can simply stop at the original afterword.This is likely a book that I will return to throughout my life. It is powerful, informative, thought-provoking, and an iconic piece of Holocaust historiography. "
280,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"The writer was able to balance details of battalions of Germans, their escapades and their perceived psychological profiles of why they acted how they did. His treatment of other writers who also analyzed these actions was thorough - it seems a well-balanced view but clearly there had been some differing points (most seemed logically for the author). I was troubled that there was more to the story. Why were ghettos even formed? When? What was the genesis and makeup of the Jewish councils and how were the ghettos managed and how did that impact the mindset of the prisoners. How the police acted is in part a by-product of the lies told to the councils and the months of underfed Jews in the ghettos. Some of the variation of battalion and police methods and timing are clearly due to the personnel and their ages and mind-set but they are also impacted by the size and age of the ghettos and the ages and vibrancy and perhaps prior experience with some of the confined Jews. Just as there was an evolution of the roles of the police in shepherding, marching, digging graves and killing, I propose that different battalions separated duties differently and were more or less rabid in their hate and support of Hitler or support of their fellow police (bonds within the groups too impact how police follow orders). If we view the roles as functions on an assembly line (developed between the Hitler and Henry ford friendship) it is not surprising that each assembly line was different. Albert Memmi did some superb treatment of the mindset of captors and captives that aligns my understanding and is similar to the mentality we see in the French in 1920-1935 as they lied to, enslaved, underfed, raped and beat people in the Congo (killing hundreds of thousands - which was a high percentage of those enslaved) to build the Congo -Ocean rail line. It is my belief that unchecked power at any level reaps destruction on the mind and bodies of all people outside of a Dunbar number's worth of desired friendships: 150. My experience is that when a leader knows more than 150, everyone else is likely to be dehumanized as they have no perceived value. It is rare for a leader to admit and presume that each person is important and has value, even if they do not know them. "
281,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"First off: this book is disturbing. That much is obvious. The events, the horrors, the callous disregard for human life and dignity is a tragedy beyond description.As far as the message and structure of the book, I thought it was very insightful. Much of the content I've seen and read of the Holocaust to-date has been in the form of Hollywood productions or documentaries, and this is decidedly a different flavor of information and format. I appreciated the alternative perspective on the matter which the author brought forward, and it gave me pause for thought, to say the least. I subscribe to the notion that under particular circumstances most anyone is capable of the damnable actions that are described in this book, and this book reinforces that idea. The way that the author lays out the course of events paints a believable picture that is identifiable in that the personalities and experiences of individuals comprising any given population will vary such that their level of willingness, ability, and reaction to the unforgivable murder of innocent men, women, and children will fall across a spectrum. It brings to mind the (paraphrased) quote from Viktor Frankl in ""Man's Search for Meaning"": ""There are decent people and indecent people in this world, and no group is comprised entirely of one or the other."" I can't imagine, and frankly, I don't care to imagine, what life must have been like with so much death and suffering being witnessed and experienced on a constant basis. However, I do believe I can say confidently that I know nothing about how I would react in that situation, because of the fact that it's so foreign, and so evil, and I've never experienced anything like that before. Every part of me wants to believe that I would be one of the good men.At the end of the day, this book helped me to keep in mind the fact that what you are is what you do and how you act. And that if you want to be a good man, and not just an ordinary man, you must do so. Not say so. Not believe so. You must do so, in all things. God-willing if you practice every day to be a good man, you may remain so if ever you're tested in the horrible ways that the world was over eighty years ago."
282,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/739464-colin-miller,Rating 3 out of 5,"Christopher R. Browning’s Ordinary Men may be bloated by supplemental material, but it’s still a chilling account of how the average person could participate in the Final Solution.During World War Two, a Polish reserve police battalion participated in killing tens of thousands of Jewish men, women, and children. In Ordinary Men, historian Christopher Browning explores how these average, middle-aged men, without any prior history or training, could be shaped into killers.* Early on, I appreciated that the author took a step back to analyze how this horror could happen without veering into empathy or justification, noting: “Explaining is not excusing; understanding is not forgiving.” However, as much as I appreciated this caveat in the preface, I didn’t care for his process getting rehashed in the afterword.One of the things that threw me off about reading this on my Kindle was when the book was stated complete at the 51% mark. It was a good ending point, so I wanted to see what was next. Turns out it was both an afterword (which, in my opinion, focused too much on debating another book) and a 25-year flashback. By the time I hit the latter, I was fried and called it complete. Focusing on the original book release though, I admit that while I appreciated Browning’s neutral tone, there were times I wished he would break free of the confines of his historian tone. I know that’s bit contradictory based on what I said before, but he could have held his standard while adding in testimony from their criminal trials. Regardless, the core of Browning’s work is admirable, and he shares the spectrum of people who participated in the Final Solution. Some men would participate, but wouldn’t like fellow officers who took a little too much glee in torturing others. Another young officer brought his bride to impress her with his rank and responsibilities. Overall, it’s Browning’s even tone, combined with these little details, that makes the work stand. I just wish he hadn’t felt the need to justify the viewpoint of his work with so many words after the final chapter. Three stars. --*I’ll put the short version in the comments."
283,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19944626-j-c-l-faltot,Rating 4 out of 5,"Browning's compelling account of Reserve Police Battalion 101 is not to be read lightly. From beginning to end, one gets the sense that Browning is trying to find where things ""went wrong"" for the policemen - the ones serving under the Nazi occupation of East Germany. But, as the narrative goes on, Browning's compilation - as objective as he tries to be - turns toward the reality of what was occurring: ordinary men were becoming monsters. At least by any modern standard. Which is another thing that's so striking about this book - it happened less than 100 years ago. This is not a medieval tale or dark ages story; it's an actual retelling (to the best of Browning's ability) of what it was like for these 500 or so men that went from policing the streets of Germany to openly slaughtering hundreds of thousands of Jewish men, women, and children. My only critique of this book is the lack of outside information on the War. In other words, having more context of what was happening in the War would have helped me visualize everything that was going on. Browning details the events of Police Battalion 101 very well, but I am sometimes lost as to where in the story of the War I am in. Granted, he dates everything that he can and his last chapter ""Ordinary Men"" gives a great rundown of what he's written, however, I would have liked to hear more of the external happenings during that time - not just the constant schedule of the police battalion. My reasoning behind this would be to give a better perspective of how and why the battalion's men moved in the direction that they did. And what better known events were taking place at the time (Normandy's storming, the bombing at Pearl Harbor, Hitler's conquests of East Europe, etc.). Although, as I write this, I can recognize the utility in not escaping the vacuum the policemen were in - to keep their story succinct and to the point. I enjoy reading history and though this reading is not light, it serves as a grim reminder of what human beings are capable of. "
284,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52649826-john-blackman,Rating 3 out of 5,"I read this in the recommendation of Jordon Peterson. It is a chilling tale of how ordinary middle aged police men were turned into killers and how only a small portion of these men objected to the point of avoiding execution duty whereas most sullenly went along with the task but completed it nonetheless simply because it was an order from on high. In Poland during the early 1940s, German police battalions no larger than 500 men systematically executed tens of thousands of Jews across dozens of actions over the course of two years. Battalion 101 racked up over 83,000 deaths.If this book doesn't make you tilt at least a little toward second amendment rights, nothing will. An argument against personal firearm ownership has often been that individuals could never hope to stand up to a state military. However, in this exact case the state military force used to kill so many thousand of people was just 500 and part of a very thinly stretched force engaged in multiple fronts. I can't help but think if even one town put up an armed resistance of just 250 people with small arms, this task would have been made much harder, and neigh impossible if 50% were armed.The first half of the book reads almost like an accounting ledger and becomes very numbing. PAge after page of statistics about how many died by which battalion makes it hard to keep turning the pages. The second half does spend more time examining behavioral patterns and reasons for seemingly normal people to be converted to cold blooded industrial killers which I found to be more interesting. I found myself searching for parallels or precursors to today's political environment, and in my own accounting believe the times are still different enough that we are not seeing this come about in America, at least as of July 2020.There is also some academic sparring which may be interesting to those in the profession of historians, but as a layman reader I found it a little petty and not very interesting. I suppose if I were a more vested reader it would have been more relevant to me."
285,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1299500-megan,Rating 3 out of 5,"This was a difficult book to rate. It is written a bit like a textbook, so while the subject is something I was interested in (I have family from Poland, both Jewish and nonJewish) it was a difficult slog through it, parts of it skimmed. The author attempts to answer how ordinary men became brutal killers of European Jews. These men, mostly middle aged, joined the Reserve Police Battalion 101. They were German men who were told that they wouldn’t be called up to fight on the Russian front. They were sent to Poland and on their first assignment were to round up all of the Jews in the town and kill them. They didn’t know this beforehand. Their leader was crying and told the men that they didn’t have to if they were opposed. There were about 12 men who eventually stepped away. Alcohol was brought in to help them individually kill all the men, women and children. It got easier for some and they continued to volunteer to kill. Other parts of their job was to round up the Jews in ghettoes and put them on transport to the death camp, Treblinka. This was easier because, although all of these people were going to their deaths, the police were removed from the killing. They also had to do the “Jew Hunt”, this was finding all of the Jews who had hidden in the forest or other places to avoid being captured. Eventually, this group was responsible for killing about 400,000 Jews in a short period of time.This was awful. The last couple paragraphs of the book attempts to explain the behavior of these 500 men—“This story of ordinary men is not the story of all men. The reserve policemen faced choices, and most of them committed terrible deeds. But those who killed cannot be absolved by the notion that anyone in the same situation would have done as they did. For even among them, some refused to kill and others stopped killing. Human responsibility is ultimately an individual matter.”It’s horrible to think humans can do such horrible things to another and yet it happened then and happens today."

A seemingly ordinary cross section of German civilian men who were too old to join the military. These supposed “ordinary men” were tasked with shooting the victims directly without the psychological distancing afforded by industrialised gas chambers. Even more unbelievable is that several times, the shooters were told that if they didn’t have the stomach for it, they could excuse themselves without punishment. Even though the policeman found the killing to be extremely psychologically taxing, most of them forced themselves to go through with it.The book explores exactly how ordinary people can be made to do monstrous things. After considering the many variables at play, he concludes that the driving factors were respect for authority and not wanting to lose respect and social standing among peers. He rejects that this was an incident peculiar to Nazi ideology, coercion or sadism. All of this implies that most people that found themselves in situations like this would end up conforming to the group around them.The book deals with the criticisms put forward by other scholars and explores in depth the differences with “Hitler’s willing executioners” which looked at the same evidence and came to the opposite conclusion. The book at times reads like a series of reports which becomes tedious. I imagine this is because the author wants to be rigorous in his subject. This focus can also make it feel like he is using a very specific scenario to answer the general question “can ordinary people become monsters?”. The author mentions the book “Becoming Evil” which I think will be a good follow up drawing on the numerous other atrocities that have been committed in history.I’d give it a 5/5 for reporting on the Police Battalion 101 and maybe a 3/5 for the explorations of human psychology. It was all relevant and coherent but somewhat basic and vague. If you want to know about people’s capacity for evil this is definitely only one piece of the puzzle."

Terrifying book about how the most ordinary and least susceptible people could commit terrible war atrocities. Many graphic scenes and careful discussions/analysis about what happened. The author is careful to claim that many of the accounts might be tainted because they are recalled 20 years after the event. There is also a lengthy discussion on the role of anti-semitism and the Germanic tendency for authoritarianism which might account for the atroticities, which is clearly answered in the negative by the author. What happened is best explained by the tendency for relegating responsibility to authority and blind obedience. Anyone is capable of doing such evil if put in the same position as the soldiers. What struck me was the human face of the killers. Some with more psychopathic tendencies find killing people easier than others. But many find it hard to execute and showed signs of distress (vomit, looking away, dizzy, numb, and so on). These Nazi soldiers are human too and they did horrible things due to deference to authority and the feeling that no matter their choice (they can choose whether to partake in shooting people or not), 'these Jews are going to be shot anyway'. Plus that those who choose not to partake are considered weak. That partly led them to commit the murders. As an Indonesian, I can't help but notice that the murder episodes are hauntingly similar to the 1965 anti-communist massacre in Indonesia where hundreds of thousands were killed. The fact that many civilians are complicit in the murder, and that from those complicit who are interviewed, I sense that many of the underlying psychological motivations are similar. They are all obeying orders and no longer think in terms of 'these Jews/communists are also human' but rather 'these people have to be exterminated. It's an order. If we don't exterminate these people then something grave is going to happen. Our families might die'. It shows that when threatened, we humans might very well lose our humanity and show our animalistic side."

This is a worthwhile, if certainly depressing work that focuses on a group of largely middle-aged German men who mostly hoped to avoid active military service by joining a reserve unit they thought would result in no deployments far from their home town of Hamburg. Instead, after a couple deployments to occupied Poland, they were brought in 1942 to Eastern Poland where they assisted in the Holocaust, doing nuts and bolts tasks like deporting Jews from the local ghettos by rail to death camps, or just shooting them on the spot.Drawing on extensive post-war testimony, Browning posits that different groups of men reacted differently to their gruesome tasks, some were enthusiastic, others would simply do it, and a few would try to avoid it as much as possible. The afterward goes into considerable sociological/psychological analysis on the various motivating factors in the battalion in a polemic with another holocaust scholar, Daniel Goldhangen. Also as part of the revised 2017 edition, there are a number of photos included with narrative descriptions.The book does provide a good understanding of the duties that went into the Holocaust, and the effect it had on those carrying out mass murder as essentially a small unit history. While I could have done without the follow-on polemics I think the book is a worthwhile read. I was quite struck by the closing lines, which really resonate today:I fear we live in a world in which war and racism are ubiquitous, in which the powers of government mobilization and legitimization are powerful and increasing, in which a sense of personal responsibility is increasingly attenuated by specialization and bureaucratization, and in which the peer group exerts tremendous pressures on behavior and sets moral norms."

Police battalions were used to supplement the Wehrmacht and SS, in their deadly deeds.These men were not professional policemen or soldiers, but draftees as the tide of the war was changing. Their ages ranged from young (20’) to middle-age (the majority of the group). Most had other jobs at home in Germany and were not avid Nazi party members.Their education had been in the pre-Hitler days, though they had been exposed to the virulent anti-semitism of the 1930’s. They were ordinary Germans, many from Hamburg. The Officers were a mixed group. Some were virulent Nazis, others more indifferent. Most were career police officers.When the men were ordered to do the unspeakable, their reactions varied—only a few refused, most complied. As the war continued, some of these men became hardened, sadistic killers. Others avoided killing Jews and Poles. All were complicit in one way or another.The focus of the book are the various reasons these men changed, all in different ways. This is a nuanced study of the perpetrators, not a black/white interpretation, for example “all Germans were bad”, etc. If we are to prevent genocide—which as of yet has not occurred—we must fully comprehend how relatively normal people evolve into crazy killers. Of course, the context and nature of war—defining the “other” as the enemy—will facilitate this changeover in law abiding soldiers. So will indoctrination and training aimed at a particular purpose, in this case killing all the Jews in Poland.Milligram’s famous studies are sited, as are other experts in the field.I gave the book 4 stars—at times, the author got carried away with details of different battalions.I recommend this book for serious students in Holocaust, Genocide, and Human Right studies, whether in college or post-college."

When given the option recuse themselves from their orders to kill men, women, and children, very few individuals did so. A few said they had enough after killing some, or after a day or two of murder. Some could only kill children, rationalizing that they were preventing their suffering after their comrades murdered their parents. Others shot old women in the neck because they were afraid of being called cowards by their peers. The actions were repetitive, deadly, callous, and numbing. Every action was coupled with a night of drunkenness, and though there were some snarls about failure to shoot being met with punishment, not a single German in the police battalion was ever punished for refusing to participate in the holocaust. So long as there were enough volunteers, many would would not even be ordered to shoot. Antisemitism does not appear to be a major motivating factor, neither was hate. Most surprising of all was the willingness of their victims to accept their impending death and murder. Five men, ten men guarding hundreds or thousands, and almost none resisted, and very few even attempted to run away. Its remarkable how few were even attacked or injured by Jewish resistance, in sharp contrast to the mass murder that was being perpetrated against them. The men who did this were not born and raised in an age of Fascism, nor were they of political or occupational persuasions that would suggest a propensity toward violence. The most horrifying message of the book is that the men who murdered millions were otherwise ordinary men. It is a book with deeply unsettling and disquieting implications, but it is one that I am thankful that I read. 92/100"

I knew what I was getting into when I started reading, but that didn't make it any easier to hear about the horrific deeds these men were required to do in order to obey orders. This book was mentioned by Dr. Jordan Peterson once during a lecture in which he claimed that most of us would have sided with the actions of the Nazis during WWII because most of us are capable of committing atrocity when put under the strain of social and military orders. These men in the study were fathers and local businessmen who wanted to save face with their comrades so they chose to commit wide-scale murder of men, women, and children. They believed there was no other option and even when they found the ""work"" repugnant, they often did it anyway. And each time they were ordered to murder, carrying out that order became slightly easier. It was a gradual process that allowed them to chip away at their resolve, leading them to do one terrible thing and then a more terrible thing until eventually, these men had no qualms left. I often reflect on what I would do if the time came when my conscience could not agree with compelled action sanctioned by my community or my government. I believe if we as individuals draw lines in the sand before such a time comes, we'll be prepared to resist any action that could lead us down the path to hell. Knowing that I am accountable to a higher Being after this life helps guide my actions, but knowing all the social pressure and punitive concerns these men faced for disobeying orders (including loss of life for themselves and their families) makes me understand a little better how absolutely awful the situation was for everyone involved in the genocidal acts of the Holocaust. I like to believe I could not be persuaded to murder innocents, but I could never be sure unless the same situation were to occur again. I pray that never happens."

The main activity was to remove all jews from Polish towns.Jews were rounded up. Some were killed on the spot and the rest were taken to places where they dug their own graves and were shot. Others were sent to death camps, mainly Treblinka. This included men, women, elderly, children and babies.Escapers and Jews that hid were hunted and killed.This unit was composed of normal German men. They were not criminals, they were not sociopaths or even professional soldiers. 63 percent were working class men like dock workers, truck drivers and similar. They were clearly not hardcore Nazi’s, most grew up and were educated before the rise of Nazism and did not do what they did out of extra fanatic hate of Jews or love of Hitler.Basically family people, mostly church going peole, who you could meet at your local pub or at the playground with their kids.They were in the military, the country was at war and they were ordered to do it. A few, given the opportunity, managed to avoid the gruesome tasks or to avoid them at the beginning. After the initial shock and repulsion they got used to it and it became a routine.Most were not happy with the task, but stayed out of sense of duty and did not want to be branded as cowards.The author presents us with the facts and testimonies of these soldiers as collected mostly in the 1960’s and gives us various explanations on the reason they acted as they did.At the end of the book we are presented with another research, by Daniel Jonah Godhagen, that, using the same testimonies, comes to different conclusions (mainly that the dominant drive behind all of this battalions action was personal antisemitizm) and the author debunks some of the reasoning in this research.An interesting book that leaves you with more questions than answers."
293,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/127839594-kaleb,Rating 4 out of 5,"The book is about Reserve Police Battalion 101, a Nazi police battalion that was responsible for the massacres of Jews and transporting them to camps/ghettos. Big theme is trying to figure out how the men were affected by the atrocities and why they did it.The book starts with the massacre at Józefów. The head of the battalion, Major Wilhelm Trapp was so distraught when he got the orders to kill all the Jewish villagers, that he started crying and told the men that if they didn't want to do the killings, they didn't have to. Some men took him up on his offer, some men did the killings and were deeply disturbed by it, and some men did the killings happily. The pattern more or less repeats with each new atrocity, although over time, the men become more comfortable with the killings. Most men who were hesitant to kill didn't have a moral problem with it, they were just disgusted by doing the killing. Some other facts/notes were the widespread use of alcohol (some soldiers got blackout drunk during the shooting) and how some men would have conversations with some of their victims before shooting them.Overall, interesting, but very disturbing. Like clearly, not a fun read, but important I think. Quotes “Having explained what awaited his men, Trapp then made an extraordinary offer: if any of the older men among them did not feel up to the task that lay before him, he could step out.""“Major Trapp made the rounds, trying to console and reassure them, and again placing the responsibility on higher authorities. But neither the drink nor Trapp’s consolation could wash away the sense of shame and horror that pervaded the barracks.”“Even twenty or twenty-five years later those who did quit shooting along the way overwhelmingly cited sheer physical revulsion against what they were doing as the prime motive but did not express any ethical or political principles behind this revulsion.”"
294,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25777156-jessica-woofter,Rating 4 out of 5,"I picked this book up because my oldest daughter read it for a class she took on the Holocaust. It was horrifying and important. I found the book itself good, but the afterword was what was most thought-provoking to me, because it made me think a lot about a ""debate"" my husband and I have had since 2016. First, the book itself. Much like ""Bloodlands"" by Timothy Snyder, which I read earlier this year, this book was important but difficult to read. It emphasized one of the same points as Snyder did in his book: that we think of the concentration camps as the emblem and greatest tragedy of the Holocaust, but they loom so large in public consciousness because people survived to tell us about them. Snyder and Browning describe events as disgusting and brutal, but not as solid in our memory because there were no survivors: the mass rounding up and killing on site of Jews in the WWII era. The numbers alone can numb you to their significance. It's unimaginable and I'm glad that there are historians out there to carefully document and record these travesties. So that's pretty uncontroversial. Then the afterword. The book was originally published in 1992, and upon it's reprinting in 1998, the author, Christopher Browning, added an afterword to address the feud that had erupted between him and author/historian Daniel Jonah Goldhagen, who wrote ""Hitler's Willing Executioners"", which used the same historic events and records as Browning's book. In a nutshell, and glossing over many nuances, the focus of Browning's book is on the ""ordinary"" aspect of the men who carried out these atrocious acts while part of the Reserve Police Battalion. He says that they were, for the most part, non-political, fairly moderate men who weren't rabid Nazis or anit-Semites. And yet they rounded up and killed, face to face, in huge numbers at a time, thousands of Jews. Goldhagen tells the story of these same men, but focuses more on the ""willing"" part. He argues that these men performed these deeds because they were anti-Semites.The afterword is lengthy, so I can't do justice to the arguments here, but at the end I agreed more with Browning (having not read Goldhagen's book, I should point out). I think that what is so scary about these events is that the perpetrators, or at least those who did the actual carrying out of these crimes, WERE ordinary men. They didn't hate the people they killed. They were, for the most part, uncomfortable with their role. But they did it anyway. And that's terrifying. The reason this was so interesting to me is that my husband and I have had a long-running debate since 2106 on whether Trump voters are racist. I want to preface this by saying that I think the left has waaaaay overdone the Nazi comparison when it comes to Republicans (how can I take you seriously that Trump is a fascist when you called MITT ROMNEY a fascist in 2012? Come on.) So I get that the comparison has lost almost all meaning. I use it here simply because Nazism is something we can all agree was wrong (right?!) and had terrible consequences, so we can start from that point of agreement. So my husband is the moderate, reasonable Christopher R. Browning in this debate. He argues that people voted for Trump for all sorts of reasons, and that a vote for Trump does not mean you are racist. I fall more into the Goldhagen camp. While I have people in my life that I love dearly who voted for Trump, I argue that even if you're not overtly racist, if you voted for him IN SPITE of the overt racism of his campaign, then you are complicit in that racism. And we go round and round, never agreeing. So here's why this afterword was so interesting to me. And why it made me realize why the argument makes me so angry and why we were talking in circles the whole time. The point is, IT DOESN'T MATTER whether the men of Reserve Police Battalion 101 were Nazis! You can agree with Goldhagen or Browning, and the result is millions of dead Jews. And this is what I was trying to say the whole time, but not very well. It doesn't matter WHY you vote for a man who spouts dangerous and violent racism. The possible results (which we've seen before so have no excuse for ignoring) are the same."

Ordinary Men examines the Reserve Police Battalion 101 and its role in the Holocaust.Ordinary Men is a well-written and well-documented read. Christopher Browning's research is extensive and his level of detail shines through. The afterword explains Brownings' theories further while breaking down criticisms and alternate theories. Browning also goes further into some of the implications each theory brings.The book itself I found reads like the journey of the Reserve Police Battalion. The first part discusses the role of the RPB in Nazi-occupied territories. Much time is spent upon the Józefów massacre and how affected the people participating in it. Then there is a rapid stream of killings so fast that even those who participated had a hard time remembering the details of each massacre. The final part is a long post-war examination of how we should understand the events and men from RPB101.Ordinary Men reads more like an academic journal than a nonfiction book. Browning takes no reservations in describing each event that the battalion participates in. His work and claims are well-cited with sources in the appendix. Though I respect Browning's attention to detail, I did find this book hard to read in certain places.Yet, this book is essential in understanding the Holocaust. Ordinary Men looks at the compliant men from a human level without assigning blame. It seeks to understand their behavior without forgiving. What's most chilling is how this is not solely an antisemitic problem. This is a problem that can happen anywhere with any group of people. The ordinary men and women who may be our neighbors can also harbor the potential to do the same if given the right circumstances.3.5/5 rounded to 4/5.

The Jocko podcast talked about this book so I bought a copy and finished it. Ordinary Men is a book about how ordinary people were the ones who carried out the mass executions of the Jews during the Holocaust. Before I read this book, I suspected that it was the elite SS soldiers who carried out the killing or who held the underling soldiers' families hostage unless they would commit these war crimes.The book is about the Reserve Police Battalion 101, which was not an elite force whatsoever--in fact most of them seemed to have washed out of the tryouts for elite forces or were rejected altogether. These Reserves ended up murdering tens of thousands of Jews after they made them dig their own graves. The point of the book is to highlight that it isn't the idealogues or fanatics that end up executing the fanatical plans. It's every day, ordinary people who carry out the most momentous of actions for a variety of reasons.There are pages and pages and pages of what seems like neverending accounts of violence sometimes given in firsthand recollections by the reserve police battalion 101 members. The few days it took me to read this book was a dark couple of days for sure and I'm not sure that everyone needs to read this book to have an understanding of the Holocaust.This book talked about the reasons people would be motivated to carry out such awful orders and explores the justifications and rationalizations for such a mass extinction. This book was harrowing and caused me to ask myself questions about authority and leadership and sort of made me want to become anti-institutional for a few minutes. It caused me to get really philosophical on so many levels."

Humans have the impressive ability to look back on events in history and question the actions of those involved, both perpetrator and victim ('Why did they not say no?' 'Why did they not resist?'). Browning in his work seeks to understand the role of the perpetrator and examines Reserve Police Battalion 101 to understand how men came to commit horrific acts of murder and genocide. Through this book it examines how these men, who for the most part were not fanatics or ideologues, came to commit some of the most brutal acts known to humanity in the name of the Nazi regime. Browning forces us to face the uncomfortable truth that 'normal' people will nearly always go along and actively participate in these cruel actions. He shows that the holocaust, like many other acts of genocide throughout history, was not committed by a small cadre of zealots and the meek acquiescence of the masses but rather the contrary. That the 'ordinary men' of the populace go along with it, whether it be through coercion, ideology, indifference, rationalisation, wholesale support, or any other host of reasons these 'ordinary men' with families and lives pre-war come to commit acts of mass murder that stain human history, and for the most part are able to return to normal life and continue on, explaining away their behaviour. This is a book with a stark message, showing how any seemingly normal person, any normal populace, can easily fall to acts of wanton cruelty and at the same time soothe their conscious. It is a book that must be read to truly understand the horrific nature of the holocaust and the cruel nature of man generally. "

Ordinary Men attempts to explore how men who under different circumstances may have never become mass murderers on their own, somehow became just that. Most revealing is such brutality at the individual level doesn't necessarily come about through overt sadism or racism, but through simple unavoidable social and organizational pressures, the types we face on a benign level every day. We've foolishly developed this binary, moustache twirling idea of mass murder evil in the 20th Century, perpetrated by both fascists and communists, the extreme poles of both the left and right ideologies that still exist today. But here we see that only a small minority of people refused to participate at all (this is how we all THINK we'd ourselves behave), others were horribly revulsed but were desensitized by iterative participation, and only the very few were true sadists. Most were in the middle. Meaning most of us would be too. Times change, but individual psychology is inherited across generations. Unfortunately in today's increasingly divided world, the lesson hasn't been learned. Only the OTHER guys are capable of unspeakable evil. Absolutely not true. If I have any criticism of Ordinary Men, it's the lack of true perspective from the reservists themselves, all accounts derived from interviews while they were being investigated and prosecuted, which will always be testimony guarded, defensive, and evading. So while there are many facts and analyses here, the book still isn't able to isolate the pure humanity and truth about how this was able to take place less than a century ago... that part of us that wants to grab these men, shake them, slap them, and just ask the question 'Why?'"

The author tells us the story of the Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the part they played in the Final Solution in Poland. We learn about the atrocities they committed during their time in Poland through historic records and their testimony2. The author deep dives into a psycho-sociological explanation as to why a group of middle-aged ordinary men might do the things they did.This battalion was representative of ordinary Germans. And these ordinary Germans became ‘willing executioners’. There are may intertwined factors as to how this happened:- the ever fluid relationship between authority, belief and action- strong anti-Jew hate and propaganda- dehumanization of victims making it easier for killers to perform their ‘duty’- the bureaucratisation of nacism and anti-semitism which contributed to the aforementioned dehumanization and ‘matter-of-fact’ approach- last but definitely not least, human psychology — most evident in Browning’s multilayered explanation of motivation — conformity, peer pressure, deference to authority, the legitimizing capacities of government, effects of war and racism, propagandaAccording to Browning, a combination of situational factors and ideological overlap that concurred on the enemy status and dehumanization of the victims was sufficient to turn ‘’ordinary men’’ into ‘’willing executioners’’."

A couple of quotes about why ordinary people are able to participate in genocide:“A number of explanations have been invoked in the past to explain such behavior: wartime brutalization, racism, segmentation and routinization of the task, special selection of the perpetrators, careerism, obedience to orders, deference to authority, ideological indoctrination, and conformity. These factors are applicable in varying degrees, but non without qualification” (p. 159).“The collective behavior of Reserve Police Battalion 101 has deeply disturbing implications. There are many societies afflicted by traditions of racism and caught in the siege mentality of war or threat of war. Everywhere society conditions people to respect and defer to authority, and indeed could scarcely function otherwise. Everywhere people seek career advancement. In every modern society, the complexity of life and the resulting bureaucratization and specialization attenuate the sense of personal responsibility of those implementing official policy. Within virtually every social collective, the peer group exerts tremendous pressures on behavior and sets moral norms. If the men of Reserve Police Battalion 101 could become killers under such circumstances, what group of men cannot?” (P. 189)We must learn from history in order to avoid committing the same mistakes as those committed by previous generations."

She would have been moved by this provocative book. It is the story of a reserve Police battalion of the German Order Police, the non wehrmacht troops that kept order in the occupied portions of the Third Reich. This group was mostly older, working class family men. Some had been police, but most were laborers or businessmen. Basically ordinary men. But then they are Ordered to begin the roundup and in several cases, the actual execution of Jews, including women and children. The book studies the reason why so many of these guys participated in the greatest crime of the century. Very few refused to actively shoot Jewish children.Browning goes against the simplistic notion that pure prejudice was the only reason, and explores the effects of such prejudice and other factors, can have on ""normal"" people to make them turn into beings that aren't always active monsters, but capable of unbelievably inhumane acts. A fascinating, but subtly depressing look into the darkest recesses of the human soul. As the great Alexander Solzhenitsyn said while listening to a guard beat a prisoner in the Gulag Archipelego: ""The line between good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either-but right through every human heart."" As Dr. Jordan Peterson reminds his students: ""You think you'd be the one to stand up to the Nazi's and say I won't do it.

Not because of poor writing or anything like that; Christopher Browning's writing flows and more than gets the job done. It's the harrowing subject matter. I think that, when we find ourselves contemplating historical tragedies such as the Holocaust, we all want to believe that if we were around in those dark days that we'd be the one to speak truth to power and stand up for what is right. I'd definitely like to believe that I would, in the very least. In reality, because we weren't there, it's impossible to fully comprehend all the factors involved and everything these men were dealing with that could allow such a notion to even be considered, much less carried out.The group of men this book focuses on, Reserve Police Battalion 101 were men in their middle age, who grew up in a Germany that wasn't entrenched in Nazi party propaganda and concepts such as the Hitler Youth didn't appear until these men had already matured. Also, they were reservists, which meant that as far as the Nazi party was concerned, they were pretty much at the lowest rung of the ladder. There was nothing spectacular about them, no previous history of violence or anything that would suggest a reason for their placement. They were, as the title suggests, Ordinary Men. So how in the world could this group of seemingly mundane compatriots be responsible for the deaths of some 80,000+ innocent civilians? We will never know, but this book does an honorable job at attempting to unravel that mystery.I do recommend this book, but know this: This book is not for the faint of heart."

The were a group of rather ordinary men from Hamburg area, a less fervent Nazi area. They were led by a Major who tearfully ordered his unit to kill Jews. First with point bank, near face to face, shooting of men, women and children. A task he allowed anyone to opt out of, one did and when there was no severe consequence, 4 followed. Only 1% of the unit opted out of the first shooting. As the shooting progressed, the many men became squeamish and troubled. Later, the unit rounded up Jews for the train. They were glad to take on this duty after the messy, personal executions. The rounding up of Jews for the trains was followed up with ‘hunting’ down the hiding Jews. By now about 30% of unit volunteered for this and 20% studiously avoiding it. How did a group of non-nazis become mass murderers? A culture of authoritarianism and obedience were the groundwork, and ideology played a role through incessant propaganda. But it seem the most powerful force was strong mythos of conformity. No one wanted to be seen as weak, or an outside, or as betraying their unit and making others do the dirty work. This unit of reserve police of 400 shot almost 40,000 Jewish men, women and children and put even more on trains to death camp. And they were similar to other units. A disturbing look at the evil lurking in every human heart. It makes one question if I would have been brave enough to say no. The statistics suggest otherwise. Resolve to face down the evil within.

The topics of propaganda, indoctrination, cultural influence, conformity, war time mindset, and much more are discussed, and it's determined that there is not one single right answer when it comes to such complex things such as war and everything that tends to be ushered in along with it.As I have a later version of this book, I was able to read the afterword, which was basically a rebuttal to one of the author's contemporaries. This man seems to be much at odds with the ideas presented in Ordinary Men, but I haven't read his book to form an unbiased opinion. Still, I found the afterword to be interesting and thought-provoking, as well as the post-afterword which tells the author's thoughts and reveals newly found information 25 years after the release of the original publication.Having read this book in 2022, I highly recommend it to anyone looking to examine and better understand the behavior of their peers.

Browning argues that most of the men of RPB 101 were not fanatical Nazis but, rather, ordinary middle-aged, working-class men who committed these atrocities out of a mixture of motives, including the group dynamics of conformity, deference to authority, role adaptation, and the altering of moral norms to justify their actions. Very quickly three groups emerged within the battalion: a core of eager killers, a plurality who carried out their duties reliably but without initiative, and a small minority who evaded participation in the acts of killing without diminishing the murderous efficiency of the battalion whatsoever.Thoughts:This book presents a meticulously researched and unbiased account of the mass murder of Jews in Germany by Nazi reserve police. It delves into graphic details, describing the methods employed to maximize efficiency in the killings. What makes it a crucial read is its exploration of the potential for evil within all humans. By examining the ordinary men who, despite their initial intentions, became mass murderers, the book prompts readers to reflect on human capacity for wrongdoing and consider ways to prevent such actions. Contrary to the misconception that these men had no choice, the narrative reveals that those who refused participation faced minimal consequences, emphasizing the importance of reflecting on such historical realities."

This was a really heavy book for me to read, especially given the current situation in Gaza. Took me a long time to read through. I’d read a passage on the mental breakdown of soldiers refusing to kill their Jewish neighbors, then jump on the internet to see the IOF/IDF TikTok’s blowing up neighborhoods as backdrops to their dances or displaying the women’s underwear they’d stolen from homes or posts of how the Gazans don’t deserve the beautiful beaches… the contrast blinding and horrific. There is a line within this book that has stuck with me hard “to see someone as being outside their circle of human obligation” (paraphrasing). The level of dehumanization that one has to be raised with to see someone as no longer human or no longer a “type” of human to care of on a basic level. On a personal note, it’s been a struggle for me to see IOF/IDF soldiers with anything other than disgust. (Especially when seeing the stats on the number who have flown in to help…) but this book has been helpful in understanding how some have been carefully taught to hate. Another quote from this book “Controlling the manner in which people interpret their world is one way to control behavior. If they accept authority’s ideology, action follows logically and willingly.” Very grateful to my reading buddy of this book who gave me a needed outlet for processing. It’s overwhelming to read of such extreme and absolute hate and destruction of a people, while living in a time where we have a direct example of genocide and ethnic cleansing.

What happens, instead, when we dive into an atrocity as horrifically and infamously evil as the Holocaust, only to find an overwhelming majority of ordinary men behind massacres? What factors may have led such typical people to be comfortable with mass murder? Browning's case study is a sobering look of the past, and a wake up call for the present, where everyone's grip on morality is one loosely held. This is clearly an academic and historical book. While not innately bad, my issues with it were unsurprising. I like my case study books to be primarily narrative and character driven, and I felt, for all his research, Browning didn't make his characters come to life. I think his points would have been much more impactful if they had. That said, Browning's book is full of horrific imagery. This book is not for the faint of heart as it holds nothing back in its descriptions of massacre and bloodshed. While impactful, I think Browning's point would have been better supported by overemphasizing the humanity, rather than the inhumanity, exemplified by the third reich Nazis. This is a necessary book. We need to confront the more painful reality that evil is perpetrated by the silent condoners, the indoctrinated bureaucrats, the hungry poor, and the commoner. I don't question Browning's motive, but rather his method. "
308,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1952119-ebster-davis,No Rating,"This book is an exploration of people who participated in the Holocaust. They weren't a part of the Nazi party and they don't seem to have been, strictly speaking, members of the German military but they still actively participated in the acts of trafficking, shooting thousands of people point-blank in cold blood, and ultimately taking part in 'jew hunts'. Weirdly it took me until I got to the middle of the account to consider how unreal this all seems. Not that I disbelieve the Halocaust, but it's just so bizarre and repulsive that it's real. The first part of the book is a record of what went down when these guys were finally caught 30 ish years after the events took place (most all of them got away with it), and the second part is examining it from a psychological perspective. The author tries to take into consideration factors that would cause people to kill like these people did. He keeps coming back to the fact that these people didn't have any training in anything violent. It occurred to me as he kept comming back to it that the events themselves ARE the violence desensitization and training: at first no one was forced to take part in the acts but they were still surrounded by the violence, they saw that their fellow comrades could participate, and they were continually offered the opportunity to take part themselves. I kept thinking that the author underestimates the role of conformity (and perhaps camaraderie) as a social motivating force. This is a very intense book. I recommend it if you're interested in WWII and psychology."

Jordan primed me prior to reading this book to read it in a way as if I was the one put in the position the Battalion was put in. I still have not been able to confirm that I wouldn't comply with the groupthink or illusions created in someone's head when in that specific situation. The illusions I am talking about is how the group will treat you if you do not do what they are doing or having fear of the wrath of your superiors coming down on you. Now the groupthink I refer to is the inferiority of the Jews and the necessity of getting rid of them as a necessary step to attaining the power needed to attain their societal goals. What impacted me the most was how much killing was done by Battalion's who just were gathering Jews, looking for escaped Jews, or transporting Jews. The way they executed them was told in such graphic detail and the most difficult content was when talking about killing children. That is why I have to question if I would comply with something that in theory I would never do because I have children. But I cannot say I would not comply because the physiological and societal pressures were so pervasive that it would be difficult for me to not comply. These men were put into a difficult circumstance that brought out an aspect of human nature that we all fear lives us. Kind of reminds me of the message ""Lord of the Flies"" by William Golding was trying to convey to the reader as well."

The first, an actual book, talks about Reserve Poolice Battalion 101 and their roles in the Final Solution and general comportment. It is chronological and detailed transcription of events as pieced together through testimony from the regimen. I was as bit surprised that he didn't include much from their trials but rather just the story that resulted from his analysis. That story is grim and scary and terrible, even worse than you imagine. Next, comes a sectio of the book in which you find out the author has been feuding with another academic who told the same story but with a different conclusion. This segment is modestly interesting.Third comes a '25 years later', which is essentially a more thoughful part ii where he starts bringing up a lot of interseting questions about how this could happen (the real question of the book, can ordinary men anywhere be driven to kill innocents en masse) and makes specific reference to a numebr of different events in Germany's history (requires a big Wikipedia time sink) and walks through the opinoins of various scholars on the subject. Finally, it ends with a number of pictures, which makes everything even more real .I think the first part is grim and horrible and always a good reminder but I didn't take a lot away. The second part I wasn't enthused by and the third part seemed interesting but would require me to take some academic classes on Germany history.Net, I'm glad I read it but not sure I would recommend it to anyone that I know.

Contrary to what was believed until now, German civilians did not want to be involved in the mass murders of the Jewish people. Nonetheless, they showed a striking indifference to the fate of the Jews as human beings, and this gave the Nazi regime the freedom of action to push for a radical ‘Final Solution.’ It’s that indifference and willful blindness that led the world down the road of chaos.But if ordinary Germans at home were indifferent and apathetic, complicitous and callous, in the eastern Europe they were killers. Why? How is it possible that a group of “ordinary men”, not affiliated to the nazi party, became “eager killers”? The author explores possible causes and motivations, namely: situational factors, ideological overlap, DEHUMANIZATION of the victims, racial superiority, peer pressure, conformity, deference to authority, role adaptation, “moral numbness and routinization of destruction as everyday work”.This historical document is a MUST-READ, because  war, and especially race war, leads to brutalization, which leads to atrocity.  This common thread, it could be argued, runs from Bromberg, and Babi Yar, through New Guinea, Manila, Cambodia, My Lai… and Serbs against Bosnian Muslims; or Hutus against Tutsis… So let’s read and learn from this historical document, because  “those who fail to learn from history are condemned to repeat it” ."

I'm kind of surprised I haven't come across this volume before, because it is an important piece of Holocaust scholarship focusing on one of the reserve police battalions tasked with carrying out the Final Solution in occupied Poland. Browning attempts to tease out the motivations and justifications of these around 500 men, drawing almost entirely from trial records from the 1960s (when the unit was investigated for war crimes). The descriptive chapters are horrifying. One cannot even imagine being assigned to hunt down, round up, and execute Jewish men, women, and children, especially face-to-face as they often were. Browning reports that some men, apparently less than 20% resisted the assignment, while most accepted their unethical duty and become gradually desensitized to killing. The afterword and ""25 years later"" chapters review the wealth of scholarship of more reserve battalions that has been undertaken since Ordinary Men's initial publication. These were some of the best pages of the book, and made me think a lot. The author does a masterful job of defending his multi-casual explanation for ordinary Germans become agents of mass genocide, particularly against those who claimed it was entirely explained by rampant historical German Anti-Semitism. This conclusion has uneasy implications: if anyone under the right set of wrong circumstances will act heinously, what does it say about each of us?4 stars."

It was a deep dive into the ongoings of reserve battalions in Poland during WW2, and how ordinary men (all generally from previous career backgrounds and no particularly strong political backgrounds) became the forefront of the massacres and deportations. Browning goes into a lot of graphic details on the tragic fate of the Jews, and it was hard to get through, though necessary as they were the truths that these people experienced. The gruesome brutality and complete lack of humanity that these officers showcased, especially near the end, was hard to witness. Though there seemed to be a lot of condemnation within the troops themselves of how Major Trapp and Buchmann handled themselves, I do believe that they were both empathetic and reasonable as human beings, standing firm in their beliefs despite their authoritative roles and allowing forgiveness and tolerance to permeate through the units that operated beneath them.The Poles were living hard times too, but I'm still shook how easily they could betray the Jews.Browning does go into the exploration of how this escalation of behavior and diminishing of empathy could have occurred, and chalks it up to a multitude and combination of different factors. I would have enjoyed the book more if he had spent more time delving into the explanation, but I understand as the gritty details of the occurrences themselves were thick. The reviews were also intense in their nature, and was quite fun to read as he continued to defend his work and tear down the work of others."

This book is an excellent look at how susceptible the average person - the titular “ordinary man” - is to acts of seemingly inhuman violence. Its only flaws that jump out at me are that the first quarter or so of the book gets bogged down in statistics, and towards the second half, becomes more than a little repetitive. The actual history and analysis is unparalleled and I found most of the author’s insights thought-provoking - he approaches the issue from a unique angle a lot of the time. The notion that most of the members of Battalion 101 were likely to have been socialists, communists, and/or trade unionists before the seizure of power, statistically speaking, given the political climate of the time and the class background of most of the policemen, made me close the book and pause to think for a few minutes. It is admittedly difficult for me to imagine someone of those sorts of political convictions committing the atrocities that the Nazis did, and even more difficult to imagine hundreds of everyday people doing so time and time again, as was the case with Battalion 101. It is extraordinarily well-written - I only deducted two stars because of the aforementioned issues - repetition and excessive use of statistics. I almost closed it about 25 pages in because I thought the next 200 pages were basically going to be a spreadsheet in book format. Glad that I didn’t. "

Or, in these pandemic days, perhaps look around you while shopping at the grocery store. You’ll see ordinary men and women, some doctors, some sales persons, some cashiers, some mechanics. The list goes on. You’ll see people of every kind and of all kinds of occupations. Browning asks the question. How do you take ordinary men (and today, women) and turn them into mass murderers?Remember the police battalion of which he writes functioned in the early forties. This is within the past eighty years. Can it happen again? Is there a group we are being taught to hate and despise? Several groups? What would it take to turn us into killers? A war? Something less? How do we learn to think of “us versus them?” Ordinary Men is a sad read. Ordinary men did something horrific. As Santayana said, and I paraphrase, those who fail to study their history tend to repeat it. In these days when it seems science and history is given scant attention, do we need to worry?Genocide is not new and it is not exclusive to World War II history, I’ll admit. But that as well is a frightening thought.I would strongly suggest this book be studied. Along with it consider reading Browning’s book on the Origins of the Final Solution, as well as Daniel Gaghagen’s book, Hitler’s WIlling Executioners. This book, Ordinary Men, has an afterword by the author that is essentially a response to Goldhagen’s book and some other writings."
316,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"I won't repeat the reviews of this essential book. I say essential because, while it clearly identifies the dreadful acts of (significant number of) specific people, one is left with the dawning and appalling realisation that the capacity for such atrocities cannot be neatly laid away as something neatly German or of the 1930s. Since truly ordinary men were capable of such brutality, only the naive and the insensible would pretend that it could not happen again. Indeed, we have seen it happen before and again with less efficiency or thoroughness in Namibia (Herero Massacre), Rwanda, the Former Yugoslavia, Kenya (Mau Mau), Myanmar and so, so many other places. Equally, it lays the lie that the Holocaust was the work of Hitler alone, or of a few henchman or that the entire Wehrmacht and all other Nazi armed services were not at least complicit, and often enthusiastic, participants and whose families were often well-aware of what was going on. What I found most awful to see documented is how few men refused to be barbaric and how tiny was the number of those who were actually punished. School children these days read about Anne Frank and go on their outings to Auschwitz as if the massacres could be neatly packaged as defined episodes. This book reveals how the killing was widespread across thousands of kilometres with half of the deaths individual murders committed at a range close enough to touch for the killer and the victim to hold hands..

Browning is right that the postwar investigation and interviews of Reserve Police Bn 101 personnel are a unique resource. It is interesting historical evidence of the behaviour of, as he puts it, ordinary men - not specially chosen killers like the Einsatzgruppen, nor heavily indoctrinated, or even passionate supporters of the cause.However, Browning's analysis is very tentative about drawing much in the way of conclusions. I respect not making sweeping or definitive statements based on limited evidence, but I felt that he did not do much to answer his own thesis question of ""Why did ordinary men participate in genocide?""Perhaps even more unfortunately, Browning relies heavily on the Stanford Prison Experiment to draw conclusions about human behaviour. This has long since been discredited. He leans just as much on the Milgram Experiment, which has been thoroughly discredited as well. Garbage in, garbage out; the psychology Browning brings to try analyse the history of Bn 101 is so flawed if compromises all his conclusions. Ultimately the book was interesting as an account of the way several hundred men behaved when unexpectedly drafted into genocide, but the book doesn't have any useful analysis of their behaviour. It had the virtue of being concise... except that a considerable amount was added in subsequent editions that substantially changes this."

It outlines the journey of Reserve Police Battalion 101 in Poland and how they took part in the Nazi final solution.Most of the men were middle aged from 30-40s with families. they were from Hamburg which was a city that was according to opinion one of the least Nazified cities. Despite some initial reluctance the vast majority took an active role in shooting Jews and all assisted to some degree in the shootings and deportations. The unit actively participated in or assisted in the shooting of 38,000 Jews and deporting another 45,200 Jews to extermination camps. And these numbers are the most absolute minimum. These were pretty normal men for the most part. There were some die hard Nazi SS men but most were not. They came from lower middle class backgrounds. Yet only 10-20% refused to partake in the shootings but I believe all helped deport the Jews to the death camps. One simply cannot believe that man's natural disposition is naturally good after reading books like this.The explanatory reasons for the shootings seems to be submission to authority, compliance to the pier group, dehumanizing and distancing from the subject, and the influence of constant propaganda.One officer who quickly brought his men back to base in order to avoid participating in the mass shooting of Jews became one of the most enthusiastic and cruel of the perpetrators.

319,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"Ordinary Men is a powerful account of the horrors of the Holocaust and a momentous work of social science. Browning writes with astonishing poise, conveying facts clearly and intensely while weaving them into a coherent analytical framework and stressing the human qualities of the detailed events. He is highly forthcoming about his methodology and its limits, which gives the work a nuanced yet focused tone. While reading the main bulk of the text, I struggled with Browning's primary thesis, namely that the members of Reserve Police Battalion 101 were indeed ordinary men and not simply the refined products of Nazi or German nationalist culture. Indeed, late 18th/early 19th century Germany was undoubtedly a relatively anti-Semitic and militaristic society. However, he qualifies this notion at length in the afterword, which in my eyes significantly improves the integrity of his argument. The ""Twenty Five Years Later"" section, present in the 2017 edition I read, adds to the primary text but does not expand on it quite as poignantly as the afterword. Ultimately, Ordinary Men is not a conclusive determination of why the Holocaust was carried out in part by ""normal"" Germans; that is both an impossible standard to meet and not the intent of the author. Browning instead offers a model through which the actions of RPB 101, and to some extent the perpetrators of the Holocaust and other atrocities more broadly, can be understood, and does so in a sophisticated, compelling fashion."

Are Germans just predisposed to evil? What if they were common people who attended church, loved their families, and worked their businesses? What would make these ordinary men become murdering demons. Is it demonic possession? The author says no. These were people no different from you and me. He says only 10 percent resisted killing the Jews. Many of the rest hated what they were doing, but they did it. He says conformity and the powerful pull of doing what the group does changed these men, and implicitly, those same social pressures can change any of us.the last portion of the book felt like a pissing match between academes. I understand why it's necessary; it shores up the author's point, after all. But I found it harder to read.The lessons taught by those ordinary Germans are valuable to us all. You may insist that you'd never murder anyone. Perhaps. But if you deal with someone whose politics is diametrically different from yours, and if you were under enough group pressure, are you sure you would resist doing what the crowd is doing? I hope so, but if you read this, you'll see how easy it is for an ordinary person to be extraordinarily violent and horrible."

This makes for a rather dry although highly bi-partisan narrative.Any scholar of the war should find his book relevant and informative.The psychological dimension behind individual and group behavior is discussed from the standpoint of a number of leading behavioral psychologists exploring the mindset and motivations of battalion members.This is a difficult book to read because of the nature of the acts described and the author's extreme accuracy and thoroughness.

While the book is really into the psychological aspects or motivations that the policemen/executioners went through it still left me hanging as to why they did what they did. Maybe because it gravitated more on the policemen who refused to kill than on the ones who did the killing? It would have also helped to actually mention why the Nazis despised Jews in the first place than tell us that they were merely brought up by indoctrination of racist and anti-Semitic propaganda and then ponder that such things do not necessarily make one murder. Maybe. But if you tell a group of people that they are being oppressed by another group of people they would fight back, and if they get the upperhand such as a position in state and governance they will incarcerate and execute their perceived oppressors.Anyway perhaps the book was just trying to convey that there's no one reason or motivation and it could be for any reason at all why ordinary men can conduct the murder of thousands. And if anyone who thinks they are above than the Nazis, if placed in similar predicament would probably do the same."

There is no overblown and narcissistic attempt to empathize or identify with the victims. The book is organized well. I give it three stars as of my first reading because I am suspicious of the sources. Browning is aware of the biases the sources have in summarizing their role in the final solution but seems too flippant in his justification that they are solid enough to base a book on. Furthermore, the soldiers are 25 years removed from their actions. In the end I am left thinking that the psychological experiments he quotes in the last chapter (the Milligram experiments and the Stanford Prison Experiment) are more important to his analysis than the sources. That is not to say that the Order Police Battalion 101 is not interesting. The actions and existential descent of the middle aged policemen require very deep analysis and reflection. I don't even want to say that the conclusions are erroneous, I agree with the role authority and community have to do in the policemen's decision to participate in the ghetto clearings and other, bloodier, tasks. I just wish there was more quotable material from another, similar, set of soldiers to drive the point home. "

Peterson on multiple occasions. The reason I’ve only given it 3 stars is that it struggles to be either a historical, political, psychological, or sociological book in its writing style. There’s a reason it had to be updated twice, and that’s because it has too many ‘plot holes’ in its arguments, if such a thing can exist in non-fiction. Whilst it’s a solid source for understanding the mentality behind the perpetration of the Holocaust, and the internal conflict that many of the perpetrators faced, it spends way too much time sensationalising the Holocaust. There are drawn out and repeated descriptions of massacres and deportations that definitely needed to be told, but not in every single chapter. There were areas of the book where you think you’re going to get an answer to a question, or that you’re finally about to understand something, when suddenly the author’s argument is altered, new questions are raised, or the topic is swiftly moved on to another event altogether. I certainly enjoyed reading this book, and would highly recommend it as essential Holocaust reading, but I believe it fails to answer the question for the which the book is written.

The question for me personally here is why the rating is 4 and not 5. Well, with this rating I base my agreement or willingness to agree with the author that all of mankind could be made out to be inherently evil underneath it all.Through the years we have seen written records of many war criminals from many different cultures that go with the argument here but we have also seen examples of heroic feats and people going against the oppressor in pursuit to do good. I’m not convinced here that there is inherent evil in all people but I do agree that many people have it in themselves when faced with the situation especially when influenced by group behaviour could act in ways that is foreign to them. I think we can all find examples of that in our daily lives with ourselves and people around us. It is the person’s ability to overcome evil that I think should get more focus from the author.With that in mind I have to say that the analysis in the book enriches the person and his/hers knowledge of the nazi war machine and ww2.It is a book that is recommendable to anyone especially to people that claim that all people are inherently good, since obviously they are not, even when they want to be, life is too complicated to claim and pursue that way of living."

If long books aren't your thing, skip to Chapter 28 to get a distilled overview with many psychological factors and analyses baked into the ""why""s and ""wherefore""s of the Battalion's mindset. What struck me as most interesting was the Afterword-- Browning asserts (with data to back up his claims) that the atrocities committed weren't because Germany was already rabidly anti-Semitic; on the contrary, most of Germany could care less, and the raging anti-Semites were a small but vocal minority of activists. Germany's political Right was rising in popularity due to their losses in WW1; and Hitler tapped into restoration of his people and country, first eradicating feeble or mentally incapable Germans before he and his men ever got around to rounding up and killing the Jews. Also, apparently the Masonic conspiracy is tied to Jews: ""The main threat to a healthy awareness of the need for territorial expansion and racial purity came from doctrines propagating the essential equality of mankind. The first such doctrine was Christianity, spread by the Jew Paul. The second was Liberalism, emerging from the French Revolution-- 'the uprising of the racially inferior'-- instigated by the Jew-ridden Freemasons. The third and greatest threat was Marxism/Bolshevism, authored by the Jew Karl Marx."""

Their task was to execute the orders, no matter how inhumane and gruesome. The author traces the moral degradation of those men and demonstrates how quickly they ceased to feel remorse about what they were to do.Before WWII most of them, as the title suggests, were just ordinary men. Most had families and ordinary occupations, yet, it only took a few months for these ordinarily non-violent men to turn into mass murderers, exterminating thousands of people like it was just another day at the office. It is very graphic in the description of the executions in it’s brutality and one cannot fathom how the majority of these men carried out such heinous crimes. And while it is easy to judge what they did in those times and under the circumstances that they did it, to kill a child, not to mention a human being, in the way they did it, is unforgivable.This was not an easy read.

The men in that battalion were, as the title suggests, ordinary men with hardly any reason to carry out the horrors they eventually did. In the frequently inserted personal accounts of these men, they rarely seem to even realize what they'd done (on a conscious level anyway). They were generally older men with weak (if any) ties to the Nazi party. Most signed up as a last career resort more than anything. There was little targeted indoctrination against the Jews, and even the commanders themselves worried about the men becoming bored with their official duty as Order Police - security forces in newly-conquered Polish territory. The Battalion ended up, however, directly participating in the murder of thousands and thousands of Jews and being instrumental in the overall ""Final Solution"". The last chapter leaves the reader with a question I don't think I'll be able to forget- ""...the collective behavior of Reserve Police Battalion 101 has deeply disturbing implications...If the men of the Reserve Police Battalion 101 could become killers under such circumstances, what group of men cannot?"""

Then the author tries to find answers to the question ""how could middle aged, middle class <> become mass killers?"". He mentions Zimbardo's prison experiment and the Milgram experiment, but overall he keeps an objective, scientific view: there are more questions than answers.
